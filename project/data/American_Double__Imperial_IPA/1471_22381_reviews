"Malty, sweet, boozy. Reminds me of an American Barleywine. Delicious."
""
""
""
"Reminds me somewhat of Lake Erie Monster. This beer isn't as fragrant as I thought it would be but im diggin' the flavor. Pretty smooth for an IPA clocking in at 12%. I will drink more of these when summer hits."

"just amazed to see this one rated as highly as it is. so average to me, and in the big ipa realm, it just doesnt stack up. its a malt bomb, sugary and strong for no reason, its more of an imperial amber than it is an ipa, balanced out the wrong way by a big sugary malt build, and not hoppy enough to overcome that, it just seems sloppy, and almost cheap and half assed for a brewery that has help my attention now for a little while. its hazy and thick, and although very well carbonated and creamy feeling, its not as dynamic as it should be, muted in hop nose and taste, and sweet to a level that limits its drinkabilty to half a beer. the booze is a few percentage points too high, makes no sense and just doesnt fit, and while it doesnt have off flavors and rough edges, its a pretty weird beer to trumpet as world class, especially with this many reviews. am i wrong to ask for a dry and more hop driven brew in this category? i think not. not bad at all, but as an imperial ipa its pretty woeful. sweet and grainy, strange, unflattering, forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer. Sometimes the line between DIPA and barleywine is very thin, and this beer really toes that line, which gives it a unique flare compared to all of the me-too hop bombs out there."
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Too boozy, not quaffable."
"Dam good beer! Hopslam what?? This is much better underrated by others. I dont feel im being generous with the 5 try it and you will agree. Amber color little head when served at temp hop taste is present but not as dry of an after taste like other """hopalicious""" beers. I highly recomend hunting this one down."

"Amazing double I got on a trade!"
"I prefer this over hopslam"
"For a double IPA I'm really impressed. I feel aging this will provide more flavors and aroma. I can smell the alcohol a bit on this and it's understandable with it's ABV content. With time I know this would become a greater beer. Has the traits of a Barley Wine. I would like sitting down with Crooked Tree IPA for a comparison."
"Overall, a hefty DIPA. Alcohol is noticeable, but not so much so considering the ABV. Leans farther on the bitter end of the spectrum, but not overpowering in any way."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty good beer for how much alcohol there is but it's just a bit too big for what I'm looking for in an Imperial IPA. I've had this on tap before and the alcohol wasn't as noticeable but I find that to be the case with all beers. I also find the hop profile a bit typical in the same way as I find regular Crooked Tree. Still I would recommend people try this and I'd even pick up more of it if it weren't so expensive compared to something like Hopslam. I think if they lowered the alcohol to 8-10% it would be a great improvement."
""

"This was much smoother than expected... honestly thought was going to be a hop bomb, but really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
"Thick mouthfeel, flavors were bold but not overly assertive.  I just found this to be an odd beer and didn't really enjoy drinking it."
""
""
""
"This is a boozy beer. Daddy like."
""
""
"Hops aren't overwhelming, balanced beer."
""
"Too malt forward for my taste. I get a very sweet knose with hints of caramel. Those sweet smells come out in the tase. Not enough resiny pine and citrus notes."
""
""
"Overall, most of the good qualities of this beer are squashed by boozyness. I can probably list 2 dozen beers that are at this ABV or higher that don't taste/feel anywhere close. It may be one of few ipas that will improve with cellaring. I have 3 more, so I am going to find out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose on this is amazing, and the color is a deep red. Overall the beer is exceptionally balanced, but is still too dark and sweet to be great. It hides the 12% ABV very well though, and I would still consider this to be a world class beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"12% but you can't tell that until it's gone."
""
""
"Great smell upon opening but it fades. Tastes sweet almost fruity with a hint of dank pine and flowers. Not much foam. Kind of thick lightly syrupy On the tongue. Really nice. Hides its 12% ABV well."

"On tap at the brewery while walking through the tour. Excellent beer. Wow could this easily sneak up on you at over 13% ABV. Sure doesn't taste like that. Love the cloudy body of this beer. Aroma is very hoppy. Taste is hop forward. Nice and citrusy flavors. Great malt backbone. Decided to visit Dark Horse on my way up to the KBS release in Grand Rapids and was very pleasantly surprised. Great beers, starting with this one."

"Pours a rich, perfect amber, into a traditional pint glass. Head quickly dissipates, and there is little lacing. Usual IPA scents of pine, citrus, and a hint of honey, breadiness, and certainly detectable booziness. Taste is similarly citrusy, with a more heavy breadiness component that lends an overt sweetness to the citrus. Despite a heavier boozy note on the tongue, it is much less bitter than expected. This contributes to a heavy but balanced and not overpowering mouthfeel. Recommended, for a higher ABV, yet very drinkable, double IPA."

"This offering was quite good and unique a world where too many DIPAs are carbon copies of one another. Frankly, I’d consider this more of an American Strong Ale than a DIPA, but no sense quibbling over style."

"D: This was not nearly as good as I expected. The scent and taste were super sweet with little bitterness. The body was over the top, and the finish was a little harsh. So it wasn't easy to drink. I'm not impressed at all."

"Strong malt character, straight caramel to the face. Well balanced flavor with a little alcohol residue in the aftermath. Hazy coloring and an almost nitrous head deliver an initially pleasant mouthful. Overall a good east coast IIpa that's easy to drink."

"Deep bronze beer with good amount of head. Has pine and citrus smells. Good mix of citrus and hops in its taste. Lots of hops and malt give this beer a good body. Can taste the hops as soon as it hits the tongue. Great beer that goes well with both food as well as on its own."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good dipa but left way behind by all the competition in my opinion. Also way off at on the price point."

"MF - Smooth creamy start with a biting hoppy dry finish. Medium bodied. - 3.75"
""
""

"Not a huge hop bomb, but very, very drinkable for a strong DIPA. This is a very tasty beer and one that I'll be looking to have again. Never had heard of this brewery before my Bro in Law introduced me to them and glad he did."

"Overall, great easy drinking DIPA at 13.5% abv."

"Pours a nice dark amber body, big creamy head that's bubbly and lasts a while. Smell is sweet and strong hops. Nice flavor, lacks a bit of depth considering the ABV but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It does dance in barleywine territory but not so much so that I would call it that rather than an IPA. Whatever you call it, it's immensely drinkable given the ABV. Now, the question is, is it worth $19.99 for a 4-pack? That's a matter of opinion but I say no."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice, smooth Imperial IPA. Highly recommended ! Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: a hop bomb for hop heads, particularly if a lower level of bitterness is desired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice DIPA and worth try. Surprisingly well balanced for such a high ABV beer. Give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This shouldn't work, but it just does. As a DIPA, it's fully aware of the fact that it's shameless and over the top, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. I respect that. I'm beginning to realize I have a soft spot for these ridiculous monster DIPAs like this, Devil Dancer, and Hi-Res. One beer is absolutely enough; there's more going on here than there would be in three mediocre DIPAs."

"This is one of the finest dipas that I have ever had the pleasure to sample. I love Crooked Tree and was so excited to try its big brother. It pours a hazy orange copper color with very little head but a nice lasting film and lacing. The nose is a ton of beautifully bitter pine and grapefruit hops. There is a little malt backbone present as well as a definite alcohol bite but mostly nice fresh hops. The mouth is fairly thick and chewy, coating every taste bud with hoppy goodness. The flavor is incredibly balanced. Most super hoppy dipas have nothing but bitter hops but this one does a glorious job of balancing an extreme hop presence with a wonderful sweet malt backbone. I could definitely dronk a lot of these. Unfortunately I only have two and, on a friend's advice, I am gonna cellar the other one. Cant wait to see how this awesome dipa ages."
"Overall - Good beer. This is the fist time I have had double crooked tree ipa and I must say that I am not disspiointed. Understandably this beer has a bit of alcohol presence but it still packs lots of flavor."

"Picked this up at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee - 51st and Oklahoma - 2 bottle limit."
""
""
""
""
"O - really an over the top hay maker of a DIPA - this brew has everything you want for this style. Another outstanding offering from Dark Horse."
""
"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass fairly light to medium brown. Head was maybe a half a finger but lingered. The nose is quite floral with plenty of hops, not noticing the pine everyone seems to get with theirs.Good smooth flavor with some apricot and caramel not quite as much bitterness as I would have thought at 98 IBUs but nice its seems to stay with it a while. Plenty of body, full flavored I suppose but not thick. I guess my only complaint about this beer is release time? This would be better on a nice summer day not cold a$$ March? Very nice offering from Dark Horse. Not the worlds greatest double IPA but a damn good one."
""
"Overall: Pretty good. Still a little puzzled about the big chunk o' stuff that poured out. I reserve the right to revise this if I feel ill from any particles later."
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent DIPA, I really enjoy that something can be intensely hoppy without being a bitter punch in the tongue (I'm looking at you Stone). The caramel malt and viscosity help balance the relatively high alcohol content. Somewhat simple flavors that are well executed without being exaggerated - a winner."
""

"Real huge IIPA, has a great taste and is as meaty as they come. Its too much for me though. just so bar jarringly aggressive. Malt back bone is presence and off sets it a bit. The booze is just a tad too prevalent for my personal taste. Real good for what it is though if your looking for a show stopping Killer~"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quarter inch thick layer of white foam rests on top of this beer. Color is a light brown and it looks extremely hazy inside the glass. Pungent aroma of pine like hops is very prevalent, so much so that you know this is a hop bomb. The first sip confirms that this is a bitter IPA and yet the flavor seems somehow muted. The beer is suitably backed up by a strong malt backbone. The burn is pretty deep after the fade. This is oddly drinkable for 12% and has a surprising and oddly thin but warm mouthfeel. It took me a bit, but I decided that was a good quality."
""
"O good beer. Not my favorite iipa but worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied, with average carbonation levels. There is a creaminess to the finish, but not overly sticky. Overall, The flavor profiles are fairly straightforward and simple, but enjoyable. It's a good DIPA, but not something that blew me away."
""
""
""
""
"O- Im glad I aged this one and look forward to starting a vertical of this great beer. I would highly suggest aging this one, might be the only IPA I think that fresh is not best."
"As an aside...I am not sure why there are so many low reviews. I suspect by some of the dates of the lower reviews, folks might be getting these out of the bottle a little late. It comes out in Feb and it was just bottled at dark horse these last few days (2/8/14) since last year. So people rating bottles in the last few months are likely to have an old one and the hops will be gone. Just a thought."
"Certainly a sipper. After warming the caramel malts and hops come through more."

"12oz bottle. Pours a murky, brownish swamp water color with a 1/2 inch of head. The aroma is piney and resinous hops. Floral hop notes as well. The aroma reminds me alot of Devil Dancer. The taste is pine, resin, caramel malts, and booze. Bitter piney hops throughout. Lots of warming alcohol. Caramel and bready towards the finish with some more hop bite. Heavy mouthfeel. Oily. This one is reminiscent of other hopped up, boozey Triple IPAs like Devil Dancer, Hopsickle, etc. Overall, this is a big Imperial that packs an even bigger punch. I dig it and certainly will buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured very nicely as a New Years Eve treat, heavy boozy smell with hops overtones. Hops hit you when drinking, but don't overpower especially considering high ABV. Not much lacing, but poured a nice amber color with a decent mid-white head. Leaves a really nice aftertaste, much more balanced than the strong bitter of many double or even single IPAs. Overall a great beer, got this from a friend but hope to get more whenever I venture next into Michigan area. Not something you want to have too many of in one sitting, but on the other hand very drinkable."

"I'm not feelin' it. My expectations for the style are quite high based on the stellar examples that are widely available. I would not seek this out again, especially at the $15/4pk price point. Overhyped? I think so. They do a fine job with the Stouts. This is disappointing. If this was marketed as a Barleywine then the rating would be much better. In fact it's a pretty decent BW if it ages another year or so."

""
"Taste/feel: 12%? Really? The waitress was confident it was 9%, even though I told her it wasn't (assuming this was the beer). I got virtually no trace of the alcohol in the taste, none in the feel, and none in the aroma... truly a dangerous beer. The taste is almost exactly like the smell, with a great balance. When this starts to get a bit too sweet, some hops come in right on the finish to wipe that away. This is a mellow, nice bodied, gorgeous looking, lovely smelling, easy-drinking beer. I wish I could have enjoyed it longer, but I drank it down pretty quickly. Get your hands on this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty decent. Definitely a sipper but quite a bit more balanced than I anticipated."
""
"Overall - Awesome beer, quite hoppy but still balanced, would not put this at 12%. This somewhat reminds me of a hoppy barleywine, like something FFF would do. Maybe that has something to do with the age on it? Believe this was bottled in the spring so its probably about 6 months old. Would like to get some fresh next year. Just received this bottle from a friend this past weekend."

"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose and flavor is grapefruit and caramel, high ABV is hidden. Decent DIPA. Pricey at $5.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"Overall: The fact that I can barely taste the alcohol is awesome. There beer is the equivalence of 3 domestic light beers, but hundreds of times better and was made to enjoy over the course of a tv show and some. Man, I liked this beer a lot over the years."

""

"O: Very good IPA. One of the better ones that exists over 10% AVB. They did a great job at masking the alcohol and had a great balance between hops and malts. Some breweries tend to go overboard with the hops in a high ABV beer (120 min or devil dancer) but this does a great job. A solid """A""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit more aggressive than I like my DIPAs but still a very interesting beer - there are properties of a barleywine. The alcohol is not super well hidden and this beer is not super easy to drink...but it is enjoyable."

"Overall - This is a great beer. Nothing like any other DIPA I have had, definitely drinks more like a hoppy barleywine. It hides its ABV very well, and drinks quite smooth. I would not hesitate to purchase this if I am ever in a place that has it."
""
"This pours a medium amber color with a foamy, beige head. There is a strong presence of hops in the aroma. The taste is strong, bitter, and full of flavor. This is everything you would expect from IIPA. Well made, delicious and something that doesn’t ruin your taste buds after one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A big, bold beer (maybe too big and too bold). I guess it's just not my thing but it seems to focus on ABV over flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is better than the smaller version, but still, that's not saying all that much. A sweet and boozy DIPA with some good hop bitterness. Less grainy and more interesting sweet malt flavors on this one, making it more enjoyable to drink. I don't really see this as a steroid version of Crooked Tree, but then again, it's not like they're worlds apart either. Not worth re-visiting. I'll stick to their stout beer."

"Overall - Overall a great DIPA! It has the punchy hop flavor up front but does not dissapoint on the back end. This stacks up to some of the best DIPA's I've had in my life! Very well balanced with caramelly malts and sticky hops. SO well balanced in fact, that it hides the 12% abv...well done Dark Horse, You had me at Crooked..."

"O. 3.75 I'm glad I have a few more in the cellar, but I won't be seeking this one out again. I've also had the pleasure to have this on draft, and I have to say this is a very unique double IPA. A rare true Double IPA, with everything doubled except the water. Definitely worth trying in any case."

"I would drink again and recomend"
""
"Pours a tawny camel color topped off with about an inch of cream colored, fizzy froth. It's hazy, yet translucent, with some carbonation and decent lacing. The smell is surprisingly sweet, with nice bursts of fresh strawberry, kiwi, lemon, and brown sugar. A splash of juicy grapefruit washed over my palate initially after sipping, along with a caramel sweetness from the bready malt and some more lemon that I picked up in the aroma, only sharper. There's a coarse bitterness and slight seltzer-like feel in the dry finish. The general mouth feel is syrupy though, and the ABV is moderately noticeable. Overall, I really enjoyed this DIPA and would highly recommend it to those who like a sweeter, maltier aspect balancing out the extreme hops."
""

""
"Cheers"

"Murky, weathered copper orange in color with a viscous appearance. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a thick cap that left thin, sticky lacings on the glass. Earthy ripe grapefruit and orange citrus hop aromas with boozy alcohol notes overtop caramel malt. On the thinner side of medium bodied with subdued yet rich carbonation through the middle to the end. Biting pine hops up front and into the middle with a pleasant transition to grapefruit and orange flavors followed by an unmistakable alcoholic heat. Finished crisp and dry with a lingering, intense boozy, pine hop bitter aftertaste. Most certainly a sipper whose finer characteristics intensify as this warms up."
""
""
"Poured a golden orange with brownish red tints on top of one-finger head that died slow and left lace. Citric, even grape hop aromas come out and there is some floral notes as well but not overly hoppy nor do malts come out too much in nose. I must say that for a DIPA w/ the ABV hit this thing carries it definitely hides the alcohol. Medium-bodied and smooth, the citric and floral hops come out nicely and there is a bready chewiness and sweet malt (and even touch of sweet fruit flavor) that are balanced and make it a large tasting beer. Finishes dry and crisp but with no alkie burn and this is a dangerous sipper."

"The taste is quite malty with virtually no hop flavor. A bit of caramel, a bit of cracker and some readiness the taste is dry and appealing. Depending on your preference this is the best malt strong IPA I have had. More Pale Ale than IPA in taste this is tasty satisfying and full bodied. Plus, at 12 percent ABV and no alcohol burn or feel this is a class act."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, amber, mahogany color with a small, egg-shell color. Scent is overall hoppy, but definitely has a strong malt backbone to it. Mostly citrus and pine with some caramel malt and booze. Taste is just as it smells. Somewhat on the verge of a barleywine with the heavy hops and malt balance, somewhat in the way Stone Old Guardian is. That is not an insult to this beer in any way, as I love OG. It definitely has some similar characteristics, especially in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and slightly sticky. Drinkability is fairly high for such high ABV. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that lingers on the barleywine side with its booziness and heavy malt profile."

"O-A yummy beer, but the malt was too strong for DIPA and there was some alcohol heat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the definition of a higher ABV DIPA. This is what I thought I would get with DFH 120, but Double Crooked Tree blows it our of the water. Nothing in particular about this beer stands out except the overall beer itself. I should have bought a 4 pack."

"O: A very good beer for hop heads and non-hop heads alike. The high alcohol content is nicely masked by the ingredients. A very nice IPA, not the best or the worst. Will likely try again. In respect to the price, not worth it to me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, granted at least around where I live here in New york it was hyped up a bit probably due to it's availability. I have had better DIPAs that were much easier to find that might make you forget quick about"
""
""
"Peachy and very hazy. Smells muddled and borderline yucky from """too many things going on""" and none of them nice. Taste is better... lot of sweet malt balanced by bitterness but this is kinda neither here, nor there: too sweet for a DIPA and not nearly as complex as a barleywine. Mouthfeel is fine but there's an alcohol burn to this... having had much better DIPAs and beers in general, this is very pedestrian to me."
"O- Wow this beer is drinkable. All 12% is masked well. It is not what you would expect from a DIPA. Very smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
"It seems like this could have some promise with aging as well so I am hoping to pick up another bottle to see what happens when the hops fade away."
""
"Cloudy golden reddish color. Not much head but what came lingers. As soon as I opened the bottle sweet malt and citrus hop aromas Judy chopped me in the nostril. Medium body and carbonation. Tastes magnitastic. Pine hops dominate surprisingly considering they were overshadowed in the nose. Citrus hops more than just present as well. This is a big ipa. Finish is sweet and silky smooth. Just a hint of the 12% abv is noticeable. Overall a top flight double ipa. Top 10 easily IMO."
""
"O: Acquired a 4-pk of this in a trade and really glad I did. I'm really looking forward to see how this one ages as it drinks more like a hoppy barleywine."
""
""
"O: Somewhere close to the other big IPAs from the MW like HopSlam, Oracle, Devil Dancer, etc, although this one seems to differ with the malt character. Much sweeter malts. Definitely worth grabbing a 4 pack if you can find one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and decent example of the style that seemed to blur the lines between DIPA and Barleywine, it was a pretty intense beer and unique in it's own right. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth with a lot of sweetness and booze, but the flavors held my attention, one would be enough for me, this is isn't the type of beer that I would drink multiples of. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was nice and unique, it was a little sweet, but with the added fruit aromas it had a nice fruity candy aroma that I enjoyed. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel and drinkability, they weren't bad, but all the sweetness and booze made this one sipper and it was far from smooth. I don't know if I would buy this beer again, there's a good chance that I will get a bottle next year, but I don't think I will be seeking it out and it was a little expensive also. I recommend this to anyone who likes DIPA's, especially ones that are on the border of being a Barleywine. All in all I liked this beer, but it isn't a favorite DIPA, it's just too sweet and boozy which makes it too rough around the edges to be in my top three, but I still think it's a unique DIPA that's good in it's own way. Good job Dark Horse, this one of the truest examples of the style simply because everything is doubled except the water, but it comes together very similar to a barleywine, that leads me to believe that most DIPA's aren't done this way. This was a worthy and intense DIPA."

"Medium to heavy on the thickness and mouthfeel, with a touch of alcohol present, but not a problem. Although there are no dates on the bottle, I don't think it is old but it just arrived in our market and was recommended by my """beer guy," meaning I don't expect that the hops have faded. Enjoyable to drink and solid east coast style here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a big badass double IPA which is quite complex to my palate. The nose has a whiff of alcohol, being such a big beer it would be near impossible to completely hide which it does do very well in the taste with a nice alcohol warming. A nice seasonal offering but not something so unique I can't satisfy my cravings elsewhere."
""
""
"O - This is a DIPA that is much different from the normal. Big malts with good bitterness make it a sipper. It is a bit pricey, but worth a try."
"This is a monster. The hops and malt are big, but not overpowering. The alcohol is just huge which pretty much ruins the experience for me. I am struggling to get through the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Got my growler filled at cellarbrations Carlisle and pours a orange amber hue with a creamy two finger off white head and lacing everywhere,the smell is strong marmalade,boiled candy,pine,citrus and kumquats,the mouthfeel is thick and creamy with tastes of kumquats,boiled candy,pineapple,grapefruit and finished with a citrus bitterness and overall it's a big beer and surprisingly hides its big ABV very well and I'd def drink again cheers."

"Overall quite liked this beer. I've read about people aging it but I think I'll drink my other 3 as fresh as possible."
""
""
""
""
"A true DIPA here. I appreciate that they double the ingredients. It comes out flavorful and potent. I'd age one to see what kind of barleywine it makes but I doubt I have the self control to not drink them all as-is."
"Pours very bronze and a bit hazy. Not all that impressive for a double IPA. The smell is sort of tame for a double, could use a bit more hop smell. The taste is smooth but a little flat. Not all that rememberable but not bad either. A bit of citrus does sneak through at the end but there are plenty of other doubles out there that offer more. Overall not bad but nothing I would seek out. Just a hair above average."

"If you LOVE IPA's this is the one true IPA to try before you die. It is magnificent, amazing and beautiful all rolled into one! Words cannot describe this elixir of magical liquid. The hops mix amazingly between the alcohol and malts, you soon will be floating with the fairy hop pixies after a few sips, enjoy!"

"Hopped up with tropical and citrus fruit yet nicely balanced with a tremendous grain bill that's more complex than most. I'm a big fan of this DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smoothest IPA with that high of a ABV that I've tried so far. Easy to drink, good beer to introduce """vanilla""" beer drinkers to the world of super-charged Michigan IPAs. Perfectly balanced, all the subtle tasting notes you'd expect( pine, citrus, etc...) without being bitter for bitterness's sake."
""
""
""
"Overall: Unique is what I'd describe this one in a nutshell. A nice change of pace for a DIPA. The way it hides the alcohol is amazing and this helps it to be a surprisingly easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An overall very good example of Imperial IPA that pushes the limits of mouth feel, alcohol, and bitterness. True to style and excites the sensations. 12% makes it a very big Imperial IPA but you can hardly notice. Big body but still drinkable. Other flavors get overwhelmed by the bitterness which detracts from the experience a little."
"O: A fantastic beer and a wonderful Double IPA. One the boozier and maltier side but enough hops to satisfy any hop head."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, amazing for 12%. Balanced pretty well, but could be better."
"Final Thoughts: I actually reviewed the regular Crooked Tree IPA last week and this pair of IPA and DIPA from the same brewery might be the first time the double has actually tasted like a double of the original. Lots of malt and hop goodness with a midwest/east coast flavor. If you're a hop head or into barleywines then definitely check this one out. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"Wow. I've never had a. double IPA like this ever before. It is so dark and so malty and somewhat roasty, that it's a shock. It's incredible. The color was amber to brown with an off-white tan head, hazy. Head kind of low. Aroma, you can actually smell the roasted malt around the hops! Taste is of hops and roasty malt character. It's amazingly complex. It's almost like a brown done as an IPA and then Imperial. this is nothing like the regular crooked tree IPA, so, it's surprising in other ways."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty interesting and good beer. Much different than the typical Imperial IPA as the sweet malt balance is pretty big. Its just as much a hoppy Barleywine as it is an IPA."
""
""
"O: This is pretty good when considered more as a hoppy barleywine, because of the hefty malt character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't care for this beer and it's not because I thought it was bad. I am not ashamed to admit this, but even at 400+ reviews this beer is still beyond me. I know it's good and I will certainly try it again at some time in the future. BAs who want more and more raw hop bitterness probably love it, but it's a bit extreme for my palate right now. I've had several IIPAs that were extremely bitter, yet I still found them very pleasant to drink (Heady Topper, Dreadnaught, and Ruination come to mind first). This was not one of them (not yet anyhow)"
"O: Great DIPA, slight reminiscent of White Oak Jai Alai, but more subtle flavors, tinge more booze that substitutes out for the white oak flavor. The oak and citrus balance each other well. If it toned back to 9-10% ABV it could really be dangerous. However, would not drink this on a regular basis but I dont mind the booze kick. Top 10 DIPA's. (4)"
""
"12oz 2013 batch poured into a wine glass. Appearance is orange pushing amber with a one finger head that leaves nice lacing. The nose reeks of fresh tropical fruit: grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, peaches, mangos, and lemon. There is some caramel and hints of booze there as well. The taste follows the nose nicely. It's got very tropical hop flavors along with a sweet caramel malt backbone, impressively balanced. The alcohol is hidden very well but it's certainly there. It is medium bodied and very drinkable for 12% abv! I was expecting more of a barleywine style beer or a booze bomb but this is most definitely a great drinkable DIPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Maybe is too strong, maybe Dark Horse didn't hide the alcohol well enough. Either way, booze & bitterness dominates. I wish there was a sweetness to balance this. Yes - all the classic IPA flavors are present but overwhelmed. I admire the 13.6ABVs - the brew is good and drinkable but I won't be ordering or purchasing this again."
""
"O - Pretty disappointed overall. Perhaps the bottle wasn't stored well? Either way, I'm glad to have tried it. Hope to revisit soon."

"Well I got a 4 pack and decided to drink 2 fresh and 2 aged.... It may be hard but I hear this beer does wonders with some age... However it super fresh so maybe I will have to try to grab another 4 pack!"

"O: A good, if not great, DIPA. Hides the ABV incredibly. Very easy drinking. I hear people put this down for a year, but I don't see it needing the aging... This tastes great fresh. I'm a fan. Looking forward to the rest of these!"
" Interesting balance of resin and citrus hops. Fairly bitter, and lacking the sweetness siren in most examples of the style, which, for my palate, is a bit of a negative."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet light malts, some fleshy fruit and spicy hop aroma. Flavor is similarly sweet and pretty sticky with an herbal hop note. Alchol is pretty well hidden with only the sweet fruitiness to indicate the 13%+ ABV. Not super hoppy, but probably better a couple weeks ago."
""
"O: wonderful DIPA with a dark blend of pine and citrus and really big, bold malt. A real pleaser."
""
"This is a really nice DIPA, but in my opinion it's probably closer to a barleywine. That being said, the malt character here is very delicious. It's bold and flavorful with a nice complexity. The hops are present and assertive, but tend to lend more balance than outright bitterness. The alcohol is heavy in the finish which may cover some of the hop character. I would definitely like to see how this beer ages. Ultimately, this is a really nice beer whether we call it a DIPA or a barleywine. A fan of either style should enjoy this beer. I'll definitely be buying more."
"Overall: A hophead's wet cone dream. It's not a particularly balanced DIPA in that it integrates the hop and malt components well (like Pliny the Elder does), but it does bring incredibly strong hop and malt components both to the table. It's a really intense DIPA and you don't mess around with it. I think it beats out Hopslam, but the price point is even worse than Hopslam's ($16.99 for a 4pk in Madison WI). It's probably a beer worth trying once, and worth getting if you have something worth celebrating about, but it's not exactly a staple kind of beer. I think it's probably the finest representation of the intense, less-balanced type of DIPA you can find in the midwest. If you like a more balanced DIPA, go with Sucks or Pliny or something similar; if you want a hop blast with a lot of malty sweetness, this is it. (4)"
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/19/2013. Pours lightly hazy reddish orange color with a 1 finger dense cream colored with with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Good spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, pineapple, caramel, pine, floral, grass, and floral earthiness; some slight alcohol as it warms. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes; with great balance of malt that is not overdone at all. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, caramel, pineapple, orange rind, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of citrus and pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, pine, caramel, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a near perfect balance of malt/bitterness; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slightly slick, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent and huge DIPA! Great balance and complexity of hop flavors with malt; and dangerously smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - Great DIPA, especially at a well hidden 12% abv! All DIPA fans gotta try this one! It's definitely malty, but all DIPAs are. I really liked this one!"

"O: I've had this beer twice now and its exactly as I remember it. It hides the 12% ABV very well. Its still a little hot fresh but not overpowering. The citrus and pines blend well here. Thank you Dark Horse for another solid offering!"

Really good on tap, picked up some bottles at the General Store, we'll see how that compares with on-tap at the Brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: actually, a nice brew in my opinion. felt that this actually did get better after letting it sit for some time. I remember an overwhelming grassy hops the first time around (back in June/July 2012) and a lot more heat. There is no ABV presence here this time around and I pick up a more sweetness and a bit more caramel here. In fact, I think can 3-4 of these and be completely hammered but enjoy every one of these."
""

""
""

""
"O: I knew this was a special one. The packaging was very vague and it sort of """commanded respect""". The bottle conveniently forgot to tell me that is was more than 13% abv, but it did tell me that there were 98 IBUs and it ages well. I guess what this beer lacks in complexity, it makes up for in originality. The only other beer that I can remember that is so full of hops but not a bitter mess is Heady Topper (not that the two can be compared). I plan on aging one and coming back to it maybe a year from now."

"A very impressive trick to cover up the high ABV and make this so drinkable, locking in good balance and complexities while remaining true to the style and finishing bitter. An very good beer overall and an above average DIPA. Seems like a hoppy Barleywine, but either way it was very tasty and one I’d seek out again. Extra credit for being easy to put down with knockout level ABV."
"O: This is really more of a hoppy Barleywine than a DIPA, but it's quite nice. Sweet toffee, thick, with a great citrus hoppiness. I really enjoyed this."
""
""
"Wow. This is really good. For a beer that's over 13%ABV this is stupidly drinkable. This is a really, really good BIG IPA—I'm not sure I've had such a balanced and pleasant IPA this big. It's ridiculous, it shouldn't be possible. And yet here we are."
""
""
"Overall, a great DIPA. The booze originally didn't seem like it was that powerful but it really does linger. There's plenty of malt in this one and I feel like it slightly overpowers the hops. Maybe that's just me. Either way, a great beer."

"O: Give it a 4 overall. I aged this a bit because the bottle said I could. My expectations were low, and I'm pleasantly surprised. The appearance looked great. The taste, for a slightly aged DIPA, was really good. The smell and feel were kind of throwaways for me, which pushed the overall score down. Pretty good brew, though."

"The most interesting thing about this beer (aside from excellent balance and craftsmanship, I mean) is how the high ABV is almost completely masked. At no time at all was I able to detect any boozy hotness in either the nose or flavor. Dangerously delicious."

"Pours a murky orange color with a khaki head. Sweet caramel and toffee with sweet citrus, a bit of pine, pineapple, and maybe some booze, too. Definitely on the sweet side. The flavor is a bit boozier than I’d like. Citrus peel and pine give a pronounced bitterness. Toffee, bread, and toasted malt are all quite strong as well."
""
""
"The bottle was marked """Ages Well", but I was dubious until I began my pour. I got two fingers of dense tawny head that as it fell, left such sticky lacing behind that I was going to have to rent a jackhammer later to remove it. Color was not only a cloudy amber, but there were floaties evident. Hmm. Nose was oily with a caramel odor underlying it. Mouthfeel was tending upwards to viscous, but not quite that thick. The taste was of alcohol heat, caramel and minty hops. Finish was breathtaking thanks to the alcohol. It was already a hot day, but now I was sweating like it was going out of style. Jesus! This was no playing around and yet a Triple IPA was on-deck. What is the matter with me (besides just about everything)?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my preference in the hop profile or malt bill. I couldn't find any particular faults, other than it being boozy - but honestly, at 12% even that wasn't over the top. But not one I will be in a hurry to repeat."
"O. Probably should have got my hands on this guy a little sooner. Decent enough beer, but most of the hopiness has faded away."
""

"Overall, a really solid offering, I'll have to get some more to store away for when it gets colder. Certainly not the refreshing summer thirst quencher I was looking for, but awesome none the less."

"O: Definitly a top notch IPA. The malt and hops are balances at a high intensity of flavors. It all works together to create a simple yet strong and intense taste that an IPA should have. This one stands apart by being simple and bold."
"Nose of resinous, sticky pine hops, caramel malts and just a hint of alcohol. The taste is really similar to the smell but the hops are slightly fruitier and the alcohol is a little stronger. It says on the bottle that it ages well (which I didn't notice until I already opened it or I would've kept it for a little while) and you can definitely tell with that alcohol burn. Its hoppy, but its balanced, reminds me a little bit of DFH's 90 Minute IPA, just stronger. Its really good, it deserves its 92 point score."

"Yuck. From the putrid dirty brown color to the obnoxious sweet prune nose this has to be one of the worst brews I have had. Nothing going on here from the beginning. It only got worse as I gave it time, baked raisins, chuncky white floaties in a brown liquid, no thanks."
"The bourbon barrell plead the fifth I had before this pushed my thoughts to the brink. This might have tipped me over."
""
" I could not find the ABV on the label, and I started w/o reviewing BA's listing, so I didn't know what I was dealing with from the onset. Wow, damned smooth for a 12+% beer. Maybe that pepper I got in the finish was alcohol burn that I didn't recognize. Really good beer!!!"
""
"O- Awesome stuff. The hop flavor was much stronger fresh and may have made me give it a higher aroma and taste rating. With a little age this beer is easier to handle and is a sure winner at any age, I would like to have an old one but Id probably prefer the fresh hop bomb. Drink this with a full understanding of what your getting yourself into and you'll likely be pleased."

"I only had two bottles of this and I wish I had saved one for some age. I'll be sure to do that next year and see how it develops."

"Served on-tap at Capone`s in PA. It has an appearance of amber with a couple fingres of white head. The aroma has caramel, citrus and sugar. Taste is a bit over the top imo, too sweet, a good dose of hops. Mouthfeel is full, a rather bitter finish. A pretty good DIPA, but I found it to be one that pushed the envelope too far, where the taste and overall quality of it became comprised. Still good, but I don`t feel it is anything more than that."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Judging by ABV alone, this beast of a beer may seem like the DIPA to rule them all. However, it displays poise in its balanced display of qualities--in this case, balance equates to all of the hops and pale malts that will fit in a 12 oz. bottle. While alcohol has a speaking role in the cast, it does not dominate; its absence would be more distracting. It drinks more ably that some other big DIPAs that are 2-3 points smaller. An oaked version of this could threaten Alpine's excellent Exponential Hoppiness."

"O- I really like this beer a lot. One of my favorite dipas. I even enjoyed it more when I had it fresh. I can't get over how smooth it is and how there is such a small amount of alcohol burn for being such a big beer."
"O: OVerall, GREAT beer. One of my top tens!"
""
""
"So here's the scoop. I was warned that this brew will be more like a barleywine with some age. I expected it and enjoyed it for what it has become and it has been rated with this foreknowledge. However, if you expect a nice, aggressive DIPA get it fresh. It is actually nice to know that you can age this and enjoy the changing characteristics if you so happen to swing that way."

"Kevin hooked this up in our trade! Poured from undated bottle to pint glass the beer is a deep amber orange that doesn't allow light to penetrate very well, extremely hazy. A thin 3/4 finger white head with some retention and minimal lacing. The nose is fairly muted but sweet with a noticeable alcohol heat. Caramel malt tones, and perhaps a hint of earthy hops. The taste follows suit, very sweet, crisp with a more pronounced malt character. Not much bitterness at all, nor hop flavors. Finishes smooth and clean with a lasting sweetness on the tongue. Adequately carbonated but fairly still. Overall, if I didn't see the bottle I would have guessed this to be a barley wine rather than a double ipa. Glad to have tried it, won't be back."
"D - This absolutely leans more towards barleywine territory. It's got a heavier malt quality than Behemoth but drinks very well for the abv. I will cellar a few just to see what happens, but it's good to go right now if your patience tends to dwindle."
"I must admit that I am biased here, for this really reminds me of Crooked Tree (and I really like Crooked Tree). It's quite literally a """double""" Crooked Tree. It's a bit odd to characterize this as a DIPA, but it's a great beer regardless."
"O- This was a very good Imperial IPA, however it definitely wasn't my favorite (that award goes to Heady Topper). The beer had a nicely balanced citrus hops taste that suprisingly hid the abv quite well. At the most I would have guessed this beer had an abv of 9-10%. Compared to Crooked Tree this beer was a little bit less bitter and was sweeter, hoppier, and had more flavor. This beer was definitely worth tasting (beaware it will have a suprisingly strong kick to it), however I'm not sure if I'd spend the money to try it again considering the price ($20 for a 4-pack at local liquor store, $12 for a 14oz at the bar)."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler, the beer is a hazy, bright, orange-copper color with a thin, dense, beige head of densely packed small bubbles. Aromas leap off the beer, with rich malt and citrus sweetness leading the way, balanced with a subtle bitter and green hops presence. Smells delicious. Flavors are rich and surprisingly malty, with a biscuity backbone and some rich caramel sweet character projecting on the palate. The hops make themselves known on the back end of the palate, with a dark, resiny, cedar character that carries a strong bitterness with it all over the tongue. There is a great, sparse lacing left along the glass as you go. Extremely well balanced beer. The aftertaste is effervescent (if you can believe it) with floral and citrus hops character, as well as a rich caramel profile. Smooth, clean finish to a very complex, tasty brew. Bravo!"

"Overall my question is where are the hops? Luckily for 13.6% it doesn't feel like a punch in the gut or a knock to the side of the head."
""
"O- Not impressed. Very sweet, not much hops, not much of a DIPA to be honest. Full disclosure, I have no idea how old this bottle is because they don't date their bottles, I suspect about 6 weeks old."
""
"Overall this beer was quite a surprise all the way from having a 13.6%abv (not feeling it at all either, weird) to the burnt orange color thanks to the unsettled yeast. Definitely would love to try this again, but fresher."

"outstanding. will have to try the crooked tree for comparison."
"Pours a dark amber with golden and reddish hues with a one finger cream head. Little to no lacing. Piney hops and booze dominate the aroma rising from the glass, however there is a very understated sweetness coming the abundant malt. Citrus, sweeter than one would expect upfront perhaps even a floral note of orchid with understated bitterness, transitioning to sweet malt and closing with an intensely strong grapefruit rind and piney bitterness and very apparent alcohol warmth. Very creamy and syrupy full body, but a surpising high level of carbonation when compared to other DIPA's with higher abv's. A hopheads dream, an artfully crafted palate wrecker."
""
""
"The more you drink, the more the citrus fruit comes out. Its a faint juicy characteristic like oranges and sweet grapefruit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good double IPA, full of everything that a hophead would crave in a beer of the style. The hops are very nicely balanced, and the flavors mingle well with each other, so that the hop profile isn't overly dominated by one huge flavor. The malts do tend to lose out a bit in the main mouthful, and struggle somewhat to keep up with the bitterness, but are still present in decent enough qualities to make themselves noticed. And the heavy alcoholic vapors of the aftertaste make me feel like I just took a shot of hard liquor. Still, there is much to appreciate in this brew, and again, any hophead wouldn't go very wrong in picking up a four-pack."

"At $3 for 6 oz at Capone's in PA I could have drank this all night. One of the most delicious IPAs I've ever had. Find this, drink this, enjoy this. 4.5"

"Overall being fresh this beer has pleasantly made me change my mind about this beer. Fresh, it's great!"
""
"Not exactly sure what to call the color, but I like it. Light bronze? The head isn't huge, but it is certainly there, and not going away, which is remarkable for a beer of this strength. While fairly clear, the beer stops a bit short of the translucence I have seen and love in the style. Other than that, not a whole lot to improve on looks-wise. Where aroma is concerned, no beer geek who gives this one a whiff will have any doubt as to what style of beer is in the glass. However, that being said, I should be able to make that deduction from a foot away with something like this. The hops are there, there's a surprising amount of malt and definitely a little booziness, but overall I just felt like the aroma could be a little bolder. Taste, forgeddaboudit. So good. Unreal. I was trying to pin down one of the main flavors I really liked, figuring it was something with the hops. It's the malt! It really comes through initially before the hops take over and make a serious statement. American all the way. The finish moved toward dry but stopped before it really got there - still some sweetness to this monster of a brew. The hops, unsurprisingly, get the last word, as the bitterness just hangs around all night and will probably stay until you forcibly kick it out. Just... wow. Tectonic plates of malt and hops interacting here. Unsurprisingly, the body is big, slick, and sticky. I wouldn't have minded if it were a little less carbonated, really. At the end of the day, this is the only true """double""" IPA I'm aware of (they simply doubled their IPA recipe, seriously) and it lives up to the billing admirably. You might not hear this one in breath with the Plinys and the Dreadnaughts and the Hopslams and what have yous, but damned if it doesn't belong there or in another, higher, class of its own. Not just worth having if you have the opportunity; worth seeking out to have that opportunity. I've had my share of Dark Horse over the years as a native Michigander, and if you haven't given them a shot recently, take the chance on this one. A standout on the jaded DIPA scene."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a cloudy reddish orange, with a creamy off white two inch head, that leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is tangerine, pine, grapefruit, and apricot. Taste is very well balanced with what the nose picked up, with a nice pungent grapefruit finish with some alcohol. Body is on the large side, plenty of carbonation, not overly dry, and for its huge ABV very drinkable. This is outstanding, a treat for all hop heads."
""
""
""
"It had an inviting floral-orange citrusy aroma which was followed by a big, hoppy, chewy pine flavor. Lots of pine and grass come across. Finishes thick and chewy, with a big piney resin. Everything I think of when I think of an imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Drinks more like a barleywine than a DIPA. Very heavy and full. Something akin to Bigfoot. A lot of flavor going on, but it's well balanced...or as well as it can be for such a big beer. Drinks well fresh and becomes something unique with some age thrown on it."
""
"O: I don’t usually like malt-forward DIPAs, but this one had more of that flavorful old ale character that I love (instead of the syrupy caramel insanity that you’d get from Southern Tier 2XIPA or DFH 90 Minute). I’m thinking that the hop resin tastes probably did a lot to increase the super-booziness of the palate towards the end, so I’d like to know what some age would do for this beer; plus, there’s an absolutely huge yeast cake at the bottom of the bottle, so I’m guessing there would be a ton of refermentation with the passing years. At any rate, it’s a nice, interesting DIPA at the current moment."
""
"This beer is pretty boozy fresh but mellows out after a bit of age. Not too bad but nothing I'd seek out again."
"O - A nice twist on a triple IPA / baleywine. Not a tongue scraper. Fairly well-balanced. Not mind-blowing but enjoyable."
""
"O-an interesting DIPA with some barleywine-like character"
""
"Verdict: More like a hoppy barleywine in my opinion, especially considering the high ABV, which is very well hidden. Despite the oddities about this beer, it's awesome, definitely one to seek out."
""
""
"Ultimately, I'd say the fresher beer is the better one (which is what my rating applies to). I wouldn't call either great, or even good, but the fresh bottle does have some nice hop characteristics and is surprisingly mild for something with such a high abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall… I’m not sure. I been really excited about this beer ever since I heard about it last summer, so I had pretty high expectations. 1) Not worth the price (about 4.5-5 for a single), that’s the big one right off the bat. It was great but at the same time nothing mindblowing. I’m not sure how much this beer would benefit from being aged since its not all that bitter in the first place."

"Very rarely do I have time to review a beer anymore because 2 kids is 1 more than 1. Pours a hazy orange with a sticky white head. Crazy nice lacing. Smell is very unique. Very grainy, floral, not much citrus. More floral than citrus. Tastes grainy and floral. A bit of citrus, but really not much. More grain than anything. Just can't catch the exact flavors. Mouthfeel is actually a bit sticky for a DIPA. Full, perfectly carbonated. Overall, I gave this a 4. I found it to be really really good, and something that I would definitely buy again, however not spectacular. Solid beer though. Recommended for sure, but not the Hoppiest DIPA i've ever had for sure."
""
"O - This is very good, intensely bitter, very nice when fresh. It mentions aging on the bottle, maybe I'll put a couple away to see how it mellows over time"
"O - This is a very good DIPA. I have no idea how they hid almost 14% ABV in this thing. If you are looking for a bitter beast of a beer, look no further than this."
"O - Very interesting and a sipper. It's a dangerous beer because the high alcohol is so well hidden, it would be easy to down a few of these without thinking much about it before hitting a wall."
""
"O: Very good Double IPA, drank before and will drink again, can't wait to try this on-tap someday"
"Overall: Really solid midwest DIPA. I did not realize that this was a beer over 13% until I got ready to review it. If i would not have noticed the ABV, I would have thought it was easily under 10%. This really impressed me. I am a fan of this beer; I would not be scared to pick up a 6 pack of this beer even though its a little expensive. Good job Dark Horse!"
"o - decent beer and surprisingly drinkable for 13%, but comes off as kind of heavy handed. i feel like this needs a few months to mature a little bit. i'm definitely not in a hurry to drink my other bottles and will likely pass on this in the future."
"Overall, quite impressed with this brew. Have been a fan of the crooked tree and the double is amazing."
"It has a VERY nice kick to it, and goes down easily at such a high ABV. Just enough citrus added along with the hops to make this such a stellar DIPA. I will DEFINITELY be looking out for more of this!"
""
"Hazy orange body with a slim, sticky white head that leaves ample, stringy rings of lace on the glass. Deep, smooth hoppy aroma...juicy citrus, fair amount of malt sweetness, light caramel, pear, dry fruit, some peppery alcohol. Sweet, hoppy, fruity, spicy citrus flavor. Some booze. Dry, better-than-medium, creamy body and bitter. Sort of veering into barleywine territory here. Solid overall, but nothing outstanding."
""
""
""
"Excellent IIPA, which would have gotten higher rating if there were not so many other finer offerings nowadays. It is a great blessing to be a hoppy pale lover in America 2012."
""
"O) This was pretty good. If I had to choose between this and DFH 120, I'd likely reach for the DFH, even so, I'd certainly recommend giving this a go. Cheers...."

""
""
""
"O - This is a great DIPA, although I see where others are coming from classifying it as more of a barleywine. I was surprised to see """ages well""" on the label. I think I may put one or two from my four pack down in the cellar to see what happens with a year or two, but I very much enjoy the hoppiness it possesses fresh. The flavors are certainly on the sweeter side, but I mostly enjoyed the pronounced citrus and piney hop notes. It has a dangerous combination of very high alcohol and drinkability. I highly recommend this beer, but don't say I didn't warn you."
"Overall, I love the concept behind this beer. A true double IPA - double everything and put it in a bottle. It gets some serious points from me for that but there is still room to master said concept. This is something that I'd like to see more brewers tackle."
""
""
"No wicked bitterness, just wacky hops. Almost balanced. A cellar candidate, for sure. Unusual, and I love the unusual. 4.0"
"Pours out an amber hue with a thick white head that quickly disappears and leaves very good retention and some rather nice lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of pineapple, peaches, citrus, caramel, malts and sugars. The taste starts out with some sweet malts followed by some pineapple, peaches, citrus and caramel and has a slight alcohol taste throughout. it is a nice smooth and creamy tasting beer that has some stickiness to it and leaves the mouth slightly dry. A very well made full bodied DIPA from one of my favorite breweries and one that is a must try, but just be careful after all it does have 13.60% ABV."
""
"Overall this is still a very good DIPA for a hop head. Depite the heavy body, the ABV is pretty well hidden within the taste. For $5.00 a 12 oz though, I doubt I will be buying much more unless it's on draft somewhere."
""
""
"Overall - Trying too hard to be 120 but failing, this thing is not good to me and I'm pairing it with some excellent cheese. Dont call this a damn IPA if there are barely any hops to detect at all. MALT BOMB, ALCOHOL BOMB ... beware."
"Overall, the ABV is well hidden - drinks like a 9 or 10% DIPA. Rich, tasty sipper. So much more approachable than most American Barleywines - even w/a strength that tops them."
""
""
""
"Body: Light carbonation and heavy body. Perfect for the style."
"O- Overall this is a pretty great DIPA, it's really tasty and is actually pretty easy drinking for such a high ABV, this is the first brew I've tried from Dark Horse and I'm pretty impressed."
""
""
"Overall: Go get this beer if it's available to you. Dark Horse has truly achieved excellence with this ale."

""
""
"*** After having this beer three times, I have started to notice the chive like hop character that this beer seems to have the reputation for. I, however would not change any of my scores for the beer."
"Cost: $4.19 for a 12 oz or $16.99 for a four pack."
"I would have preferred a little more of the grapefruit notes to come through in the taste. A very interesting DIPA but not one I will revisit much at this price point."
"This is up there with hop crisis as my favorite boozy dipas"
"This beer pours a burnt orange and cloudy, with a bit of white head with some nice retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is a bit sweet with lots of tropical hop notes. Mango, pineapple, but more in a day old fruit salad (not bad) sort of way. Some caramel sweetness as well. Flavor is pretty bitter, very mangoey, caramel, and a bit of citrus. Very enjoyable. Maybe closer to barleywine than DIPA, but it is still very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than I would generally want, and there is some ok carbonation, but I usually prefer my IPAs to be drier."
""
""
""
"Wow, what a giant beer. Pours an orange, goldish, amber color with a bit of lacing and some bone colored head. The smell is huge, with citrus and pine hops, and a deep butterscotch note when I inhale deeply. The taste is massively hoppy, with a hint of boozy burn. Otherwise, the alcohol is hidden well. The mouthfeel is slick and oily, and the finish is chalky and medicinal."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: fairly unique for the ever expanding IPA/DIPA style, this is a must try for all you hop-heads out there. a little underwhelming on the flavors, but so smooth and drinkable for a big bodied high ABV beer. probably not worth the price tag in bulk (paid $5 for a 12oz), but definitely worth picking up a bottle or two if you can."
"Cheers!"

"Have had this a few times now. Pours a dark copper color with a thick creamy white head on top. Aroma of big caramel malts and huge pine hops. Lots of biscuit and toffee behind the massive pine cone aroma. My first sip follows with a big thick syrupy mouthfeel, low to medium carbonation, and plenty of booze. It let's you know this is 13.6%. Flavor is big malts, very sweet, booze, and a finish that ends with the expected bitter pine. Plenty of warming on the way down. A slow sipper. Pretty good if you want to go somewhat extreme, but would benefit from a bit more bitterness. This is really more of a barleywine."
""

""
""
"O: Dark Horse makes great beer. This is no exception. This is a unique take on the Michigan DIPA in that it is incredibly balanced. Hopslam is more hop-forward than this beer, and that is saying something. However, it's not a bad thing. This benefit from Dark Horse truly doubling the entire Crooked tree recipe is that it provides a really unique, and satisfying, DIPA."
""
""
"O - It was certainly a great DIPA. I suppose I'm still a little jaded with the fresh Hopslam readily available. I'll be looking for this in stores when it hits this month, another good product from Darkhorse."

"Mouthfeel and drinkability were good too. Full bodied, but the balance didn't come out as well as I think intended. I don't think everything was """doubled""" hence the name. I feel like the malts overpower everything in the flavor a little more. I wouldn't call it heat from the alcohol, but there's a slight bite. Good carbonation level. A little dangerous because it drinks like an IPA not a barleywine. I don't think I'd drink this regularly, but I like it. Well done Dark Horse!"

"Thanks to TJ for this bottle. This double is a much more malty version of the other. Poured with a smallish off white head and some lace. Color is a clear honey amber. Aroma is malt, ripe dark fruit, toast. Flavor is much the same plus a little tang. Body is good, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and fairly long."

"Now this is what I call an IPA! This beer is crooked tree with double the grains and hops, unlike most breweries who make a completely different recipe for their DIPA, dark horse believes in theirs enough that they just double everything but water for their double. It's a sweet grapefruit explosion beer with slight floral notes and no astringent bitterness."
"I was a beer thief at a buddies party...he had Double Crooked Tree hidden way in the back of his fridge....obviously to protect it....and I went fishing...Sorry dude....but it was a great beer!!! The Double Crooked Tree was a big beer in many ways; malts, hops, sweetness, and abv. Some of them it does better than others. The scent and taste were heavily leaning on malts and caramel. The hops are there and pleasant, piney and earthy. In all it is not bad, but I would have liked the hops to really stand out. I won't seek it out but wouldn't mind drinking it again, hopefully on tap. Oh and whatever the abv is, 12 or 13.6, it goes down super easy for its strength."
"Lastly, God bless you Michigan. Between all of the amazing breweries in MI and my homestate, IN, it is sometimes hard to choose which great beer to buy. And that is a problem I love having."
"O - Big fan of this one, just a flavor bomb of a beer, and nicely executed blend of flavors with some time on it. This is a nice big nasty beer, you know you're drinking a honking DIPA for sure."
"Cheers."
"Overall this was a killer beer. Something I highly recommend for any hop heads."
"O: Perhaps this beer was outdated as well. Pass on this one"
"Overall I enjoyed this, but didn't love it. This is one of those that you chalk up as just too over the top. The malt body and sweetness just screams Barleywine not DIPA. The miniscule amount of hop character says the same thing. A sure try for a Barleywine lover. Thanks to claaark13 for this extra."
"Double Crooked Tree is not quite what I expected. It's my belief that this bottle was old enough to have lost nearly all the hop aromas and flavors; one, two years? It is amazing how well the alcohol stays hidden. You can tell it's there, but I'd probably have guessed cold that it was closer to 9%, or less. I would still love to try the fresh product, but thank you very much Craig."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the complexity of flavor. The presence of caramel is quite apparent, and gives this a unique edge for the style. Additionally, the high abv lends a happy warmth to the feel, and to the drinker by the end of the bottle. The hops certainly took a backseat here, but it did not seem to take away from the success of the beer, as it can in so many other DIPAs where convention is thrown to the wayside."
"overall, while i'm not overly impressed, this beer brings a lot to the table. a great sipper when you tire of your run-of-the-mill DIPAs."
"Kind of wish I had sat on this one for a while. As far as ageable DIPAs go this is one of the best I’ve had, kills 120 and other DFH, in my opinion. I guess I just don't like this style of IPAs so, for me, this one missed the mark, but I couldn't justify scoring it any lower."
"overall excellent an unique. too bad it is so hard to get...love the flavors."
"Pours a murky amber color with a 2 inch foamy light beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of pine and herbal hops, brown sugar, and sweet malt. Taste is of sweet malt, brown sugar, toffee, and a surprisingly subdued hop flavor on the finish. Very mild hop bitterness on the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA that reminds me a lot of a barleywine like others have mentioned."
"Overall I'm torn on double crooked tree. To be honest I've never compared to regular crooked tree, partially b/c of no bottle dating and partially because I just like this beer. I don't tend to drink it as a DIPA but more of a barleywine. The bottle says it's good to age and I don't disagree. Some may be put off by a DIPA that recommends aging---I can't argue that point either. I have picked this one up at several different points over the past few months and come away satisfied each time. Not blown away, but good enough to come back again."
"Overall: A hoppy, higher-gravity Scotty Karate? Though too rich w/ too much alcohol to be sessionable, it was enjoyable. Not your standard IIPA, but I recommend you give it a try."
"O: A little disappointed. I'm starting to think I opened this too soon. Could definitely use more time to develop and mature. Taste was muddled."
"Very good beer. Last DH beer I had didn't work for me, glad that seemed to be a one-off."
"O - I wasn't a big fan of Crooked Tree because of the sticky-sweet malt profile, and this is obviously more of the same (except even bigger). I do like it more then Crooked Tree, but it's still not my preferred style of IPA."
"O: Awesome! I had no idea when I purchased this that it would be this good. I'll probably go back to the store that I bought this at and get another tomorrow."
"Good beer"
"O- Either this is not a great DIPA or waaay out dated. Hot and unpleasant. I was able to finish my glass (half bottle) but neither of us tasting this enjoyed it that much."
"A big beer in many ways; malts, hops, sweetness, and abv. Some of them it does better than others. It seems the malts and sweetness are stronger in the mix than I usually like in ipas. I want the hops to really stand out and shine on their own.it smells and tastes heavily of malts and caramel. The hops are there and pleasant, piney and earthy.Its not bad, but I usually like the hops to really stand out on their own,and they don't here.I won't seek it out but wouldn't mind drinking it again, hopefully on tap. Oh and whatever the abv is, 12 or 13.6, it goes down super easy for its strength."
"Overall - Pretty good beer. Really balanced and not over the top strong as i figured it would be. No way would i guess this 13.6%, wow. Very danagerous since its rather easy to drink. The price isnt too bad either, will have again!"
"Overall I am looking forward to this in a year or two. Not sure how old it needs to be to really develop, but its young, like a barleywine in its first year. It reminds me of the 2011 DFH 120 I had. It needs to age."
"O: A good beer definitely. As others have said, much more reminiscent of a barleywine and not a Double IPA. 13.6%? I couldn't tell."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a small white head. In the aroma, boozy citrus hops. In the taste, dry boozy citrus hops, almost just like the aroma. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry alcohol and hop in the aftertaste. A sipper, big hops and somewhat boozy."
"M. Medium bodied, it coats your mouth without being sticky. Carbonation is rather low, but it actually glides over your tongue like liquid silk and doesn't grit or grate anywhere."
"Overall, just no. Far too much sticky, dank, floral, herbal hops. This beer is like hops mixed with potpourri and really seems more of a gimmick than an actual beer. I really hope this 100+ IBU craze dies sooner rather than later..."
"This has a great balance of bitterness, booze, and malt. No particular flavor is sticking out at me as being the dominant one. Each sip yields great orange citrus up front, a slightly boozy body, and a miraculously smooth creamy finish. The lingering bitterness afterwords is ever present, but leaves me wanting more even though i know the ABV would catch up fairly quickly on this one. The overall drinkability on this is scary because of how perfectly carbonated it is to make it so smooth, and how little you can actually detect the alcohol. As it warms it gets even easier to drink, leaving behind some of the initial mild aggressiveness of the hops. Damm i love this beer."
"O - I did enjoy this beer a whole lot, but i must admit i thought i was drinking a barley-wine the entire time. Its too boozy, sweet and under carbonated to be considered a DIPA. Im really happy to have tried and would love to drink this again, but i have to admit in the category of DIPA's this seems out of place and i am having a hard time giving it a grade."
"O. This is am impressive beer. Traditionally I am not a big fan of IPA's. This however, is a great beer. The flavor is smooth, easy to drink, and flavorful. With the trend lately of jamming as much hops as possible into a beer, this is a great change. Bitter notes compliment the smooth fruits and hops. There should be a warning on this bottle. From tasting, there is no way to ever know this was 13.6%!"
"This does NOT taste like a 13.5 ABV. They should call this shit """Dangerous.""". Wow. The look, the scent, the mouth feel, the finish... This is where it's at. Getting a sixer in the bottle shop on the way out. This could bury you. It'd be like getting served a milkshake and finding out it was 80 proof. I'm lousy at reviews, but if you were sitting next to me right mow, I'd buy you a pint."
"O - I enjoyed this one, although it fell shorter of other DIPA's I have had. Alcohol was a bit big on this one which made it a one and done for me."
"O - it's a good beer, but it's not a good DIPA. I'm not sure of the bottling date on this one, but judging by some previous reviews it sounds like the brew is consistently closer to a BW than a DIPA. Glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"O: Boy, this beer caught me off guard. I didn't know what to expect when I picked this up on my last trip to IN, but it wasn't a potent malt bomb with a healthy amount of hops. This is damn close to a barleywine and what I would call DFH 120's younger cousin. Good beer...different, but good."
"12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a dark amber color, off white head forms and some lacing on the glass. Aroma of bitter, earthy, american style hops similar to the Crooked Tree, resinous and herbal. In the taste, solid bitter hops, mild grapefruit, tropical, faint estery yeast fruityness, mild sweetness and muted alcohol. Seriously, 13.6% is hidden and the heat is that of a beer half its strength. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with ample carbonation. Overall, a really well concieved beast of a beer. Verrry solid."
"Really nice qualities all around on this offering; however, all of the different flavor qualities are a touch subdued."
"Drink- I wanted this one for a while and wasnt dissapointed. A great beer that had some big flavors and a bigger ABV. Would love to have more of this."
"Overall this is a real solid DIPA. Not my favorite, but very enjoyable. The aroma was of an elite status. Definitely would drink this again. Will be a sipper for sure, I'll plan on enjoying this bad boy for another hour or so."
"O - Overall, this is quite a good beer. Not sure it should call itself a DIPA but I liked it a lot."
"Definitely not your run-of-the-mill DIPA. It's heavy on the malts, light on the hops (other than the alpha acids), and has a strange nutty flavor. Okay, but not great. The alcohol presence is surprisingly subdued given the ABV."
"It's not a Double IPA. Or really any other style. It's just its own weird creation, full of flavors and balanced like you wouldn't believe."
"Overall seems more like a strong ale than a DIPA. Okay beer but a stylistic disappointment."
"Honestly a nice job of balance at such levels given that the hops still shine through well. They literally doubled their IPA. I will say good thing this brew doesn't come in bombers!"
"O: More evidence that my palate has shifted in terms if hoppy beers.  DCT endures the paradigm shift relatively well. I think the beer is now in a bit of a valley. I will probably revisit my three-year vertical in early fall. "
"Starts off sweet but there is a sizable hop bitterness. The alcohol shows up in the swallow, but it is way too subtle to give away the abv punch in this brew. Relatively thin body for the style. Higher carbonation. Powerful flavor."
"O-- ABV is very there and after a couple of sips govery light headed. Bitterness is more obvious in the back than the front. Massive sipper though. Carbonation really helps and carries the beer and makes it quite drinkable for the ABV level."
"Overall and after reading the beers description on the Dark Horse site, this isn't necessarily a DIPA as most would expect. First off at 12% this is huge in the alcohol department, and not knowing that it is packing such a punch, it does an ok job of hiding it. But they intend for you to age this beer, and that is kind of how I feel this beer tastes, like a DIPA well past its prime, well on its way to becoming a barley wine."
"After trading for more of this guy, still liked it but some of my bottles seemed like malt fell out of solution and the result kinda tasted like paint thinner, baconsausage tried to warn me, still decent though but if you see this one around you may want to wait until the next release."
"The cpJ"
"Overall, this was outstanding.  Reminds me of well aged 120 minute or a nice barleywine. However, this claims it's a DIPA... If reviewed strictly as one, I'd give it a """B.""" Worth seeking out!"
"O - Good beer, and worth a try. A long slow sipper as this beer doesnt seem to want to hide its 13.6abv. Alcohol is very present but not off putting, beware drinking more than one."
"I like the conceit of the beer (Sort of """we're speaking *literal* when we say we're 'doubling' our IPA!"""), and moreso I like how well it's pulled off. It's not what I think of when I think IPA (double or otherwise), but it's a very good beer."
"O - Nice IIPA, but man is this a big beer and a palate wrecker. Save this beer as your end cap."
"Overall this is an extremely bold and complex dipa. It could easily pass as a really hoppy barleywine. Though it is bitingly bitter there is a pleasant honey sweetness. I'm sure the flavor profile will do mellow out and become even better with age."
"O- Very nice Double that packs a punch. May have had a little too cold? Taste definitely intensified as the temperature rose."
"Overall-Maybe my highest ABV IPA I've had since reviewing beers and didn't dissapoint. Alcohol is well hidden. Going to let my other bottle sit for some time and try it again. Dark Horse seems to be a big time under the radar brewery that does some great things."
"Enjoy the single Crooked Tree IPA, but the Double is hands down better."
"I heard this was a great beer from a friend and this did not disappoint at all. I highly recommend grabbing it if you see it."
"Hmmm. Interesting beer. For one, I wonder if I got an old bottle? Diminished hops, malt-forward, minimal alcohol bite for a beer of this size. Dunno, but I find it lacking for a DIPA but is pretty good if I look at it as a Barleywine. But, this did come from a big store with good turnover so more than likely this is a fairly prime example and just may well be one of those bigger maltier DIPAs whereas I generally go for the unbalanced hop assaults in the style. That’s not to say it’s not hoppy, it is, but there is just so much of a malt backbone to fight against the hops. Still, I’m glad to have the chance to try it, but I can find much better DIPAs (or Barleywines for that matter) for well under $15 a 4-pack."
"O: Absolutely delicious. This is a big, flavorful beer. Incredibly strong yet easy to drink. One of my new favorites."
"I got a four pack of this. First one was had 1 month after bottling and I recall a bigger and more satisfying nose. This one is at least 4 months old, and although the hop aroma had not left the beer entirely, it now takes a back seat to the malt and alcohol. I actually prefer the older bottle."
"D: The beer is not really drinkable, but how could it be. It is a beautiful sipper and surprisingly manageable for its size."
"O- This beer is awesome. I usually like the unbalanced IPA, full of bitterness and no malt, but this is impossible to not appreciate."
"Overall very good dipa. If I'm near this again will be tempted to buy 4 pack. As I threw back the last sip I realized where the alcohol was hiding."
"Overall - an unusual and tasty IIPA. I had this on tap at DLD, and remember being more impressed with it there. Felt even more balanced, less bitter and creamier."
"Overall, this was a fine beer that I was glad to have the opportunity to try. Hard to think that something like this and Pliny are both under the same style umbrella, but it just goes to show how much variation there can be within one style."
"I wasn't disappointed with this one, but I definitely didn't get what I expected."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer, but i'm not sure where to clasify this one. It tastes good and I will drink it again, but imo, it's not really a DIPA or a Barleywine. it's stuck somewhere in between."
"SkÅL!"
" The mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth, and packed with a carbonated, bitter end. Overall, bomb ass brew and like they say, """double the pleasure, double the fun""". BOOM."
"GOOD, MAYBE JUST NOT MY THING!"
"O - A different and unique take on a IIPA. Once warmed up a bit, makes for a complex beer that takes alot to sift through, and not to mention, plenty of flavors to mask the 13% alcohol until the very end."
"Overall - I'm not impressed, but I'm not disgusted. It has its redeeming characteristics. I feel pretty good after drinking it! Unfortunately, I'm not in the """bigger is better""" camp for beer."
"Overall glad to try might have this fresh (possibly on tap) to see if that makes a difference but could never imagine this beer is possible. More ABV than Devil Dancer? I can tell."
"Overall: It is okay. In my opinion not worth the big bucks for it, but I would certainly never turn it down."
"Here is a beer that will sneak up behind you and rob your brain. Sort of proud, another great Michigan beer...from my birth state. Good solid pour of two fingers in my glass. Thick and frothy head of off white bubbles, leaving a solid clinging lace. Looks like a 16 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is intoxicating, with aromas of lots of citrus, and also a sort of sweet smell of orange/mango. Taste is a good pucker factor of grapefruit, lime, orange, and the sweetness of raisins, and banana/peach/mango, followed by the underlying flavor of malt. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with a drying effect on the side of my tongue and back of my throat. I like this brew, the kick comes just a little later than the great taste, but when it does kick, you better lay down or fall down. A bit pricey, but I would give up a movie for more of this. Did I mention it came from my birth state."
"Overall: This is a beer I would go back to again and again. It’s one of my favorite DIPAs, right behind HopSlam, slightly ahead of Unearthly and Burton Baton. If you are a hop head you have to try this one."
"D- YES, YES, YES. this one is a winner. A well balanced, perfectly made DIPA"
"D: I wouldn't order or buy this again. I love DIPAs, but I prefer them to be uber-hoppy rather than barleywines in DIPA clothing."
"Overall -Definitely something I would like to try again. A difficult get considering my zip code but would be happy to get some more at some point."
"Overall - really really great brew, just short of being great...again, in my opinion. That being said...I'll probably grab another bottle next time I'm at the local brew store. :)"
"O - The floaters had me wondering what was going on here."
"O - Great brew. Worth the hype and a very nice DIPA with good overall flavors and a very nice mouthfeel."
"Overall DCT is an amazingly drinkable and enjoyable huge DIPA"
"Overall, a really unique and challenging IPA. The hop flavors are spot on and this really packs a punch. Really good balance as well. Definitely an extreme version of the style though and I can see it being perceived as cloying sweet, although I believe it was not. Definitely plan on having again."
"Notes: 13.6% abv? Damn. This is the biggest DIPA I've had since 120 minute. Very loose interpretation of the style, but a great beer nonetheless."
"O: This was a good DIPA, bit I wasn't overly impressed. The smell was lacking and the tast didn't quite make up for it. Good, not spectacular."
"D-OVerall this DIPA was Great. Nice and creamy and had great flavor and balance of hops and sweetness. I love DIPAs an i will def. get this again."
"O- this seems like it has a little age on it. Looking forward to getting some fresh next year for sure."
"Great flavor, great mouth feel - for a DIPA it's almost too drinkable at 8%. The bottle actually says """Ages Well""" - so I'd be very interested tasting this one after some time."
"Dark, coppery amber with a thick cream colored cap that lays down some sticky sheets of lace on the glass. Orange and pine sap aroma with sweet caramel malt. Tons of sticky malt amd citrusy hop flavors but all the hops are not overly bitter feeling on the tongue. The alcohol is present but not really hot for such a high abv brew. Full bodied and creamy with mild carbonation. A cool beer but not cool enough to be as hard to get as it is and certainly not the best DH has to offer. Still really good though."
"D: This is a big beer to say the least, the good and bad of it is the alcohol is masked well. It's pretty well balanced and has some good flavor. Overall a pretty solid beer but be weary of the high ABV for the style."
"This pours out as a deep copper color, kind of hazy with a very small head with some scattered lacing on the glass. The smell has a ton of pine with some citrus in there. The taste is wicked hoppy with some floral notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel tingles the sides of the tongue. Which makes this brew very intriguing. I really enjoy this brew a lot. It really is a great Double IPA."
"Overall a solid double IPA, easy to drink and enjoy. Its not as flashy as some of the more popular double IPAs around here but it can hold its own."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the extra! Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a deep caramel-amber color with a thick, yellow-tinted off-white head that slowly faded to a thick layer and left nice lacing. Aroma of pungent, earthy hops with some light pine resin, a bit of citric fruitiness (orange peel, grapefruit), and some undertones of sweet caramel malt. Smooth, moderately sweet entry with some caramel malt softly transitions into a spicy, piny hoppiness with some floral undertones and hints of grapefruit and orange. Soft carbonation, slick and full on the palate. Definitely a step above the regular Crooked Tree IPA. Definitely a fan of this one!"
"This beer is very dark in color almost brown. Head is about a finger that dissipates very quickly leaving minimal lacing.Smells of hops are kind of overpowered by a strong alcohol sent. You can definitely smell the 13% in this one. Tastes are really malty i taste some hops but mostly a malty alcohol flavor. Overall this is a decent beer just not my cup of tea. I would share this with someone but 12 oz is just a little to much. Maybe some age would mellow that alcohol taste."
"Overall, this beer was decent but is unnecessarily hot and malty. Sure it's well balanced and easy to drink but the hop flavor is constantly being battled throughout. The hops should be the star in an IPA not just another flavor. Seems more like a hoppy American barleywine."
"The beer is murky, muddy, hazy, rusty orange. It looks thick even as it segues from the bottle to the pint glass. The head hangs out briefly before sinking into the abyss. The aroma is of pine, tree sap, resin, malt, candied citrus, and sugary fruits. The flavor brings more of the same. This drinks more like a hoppy American barleywine than a DIPA. It is a formidable brew, and though tasty, probably better shared. The feel is thick, syrupy, and sticky, with fairly low carbonation. While this isn't my bag, per se, it's well done. Worth a try."
"really enjoyed."
"Drink and overall: One of my favorites. Honestly, a real treat. Lately I have moved away from the Imperial IPAs, but this brings me back to the promised land. The hops were a bit faded, but the malty sweet body made up for it. I think this could handle some age."
"D - Decently drinkable. It definitely warms your stomach, much like Tequila. Yum, but it's missing something... At first I thought """Wow, this may be the best brew i've ever had", but as time went on I'm beginning to think it's just a very unique brew, super glad I got to try it.... For the style it's quite good, but not quite all there... Thanks Another6Pack for an awesome trade!"
"Totally blown away by this beer. Straw colored and hazy, nice head, left nice lace. The smell is dank. Like weed. And the beer tatses as herbacious as any I have tried. Also has the traditional flavors of pine and some citrus and a moderate sweetness. Never would guess the alcohol. Watch out!"
"Draft to tulip. Looks good; a darker double, reflective of the regular Crooked Tree. Bouquet is okay; far and away it's weakest attribute. Tastes great. Deep and hoppy, much like the regular, but kicked up and clearly a double. Mouthfeel is good, but it's definitely a sipping beer. Overall, I really enjoyed it."
"overall - extremely enjoyable beer."
"Note: I tried the 2010 vintage last year, and it was consistent."
"O – Not a bad DIPA, but I’d say it’s about average."
"O - This is a pretty good IIPA. The alcohol is mostly hidden in this beast. Should help me unwind nicely from the weekend."
"Poured this into Stone IPA 16oz Specialty Glass. Pours a very dark amber. The color reminds me more of a Dubbel than a DIPA. A small white head formed that dissipated quickly. Awesome lacing left on the sides of the glass. Very bitter smell, this one is still very fresh. Notes of tropical fruits, hops, and citrus. This one is bitter, bitter, bitter. This is a hop heads dream! The alcohol is very well masked. The mouthful is a bit syrupy and the carbonation is right on point. Overall this beer is one of the better DIPA's I've had this spring. I could easily take down a 4 pack in a sitting, which scares me, this one is a very easy drinker for 13.60% ABV. I would almost classify this as a dry-hopped barleywine. Great job Dark Horse."
"Overall a very average double IPA. I like hops and intense flavors But not intense alcohol. I'm Sure if They dumbed down the ingredient bill a bit That this would be delectable, but alcohol is too much. If this was a barleywine I would say age it but Its not."
"Overall, I really like this beer. It's crazy how drinkable it is at 13.6% ABV -- I start to feel the alcohol halfway through, but still get almost no alcohol in the taste or smell. Very tasty, very well-crafted."
"O: I'd believe this was a barleywine if it didn't end on such a bitter note, but the finish convinced me otherwise. Very high in ABV for the style, but the bitterness really lingers through the sweet malts, making it an unusual, if still very good beer that definitely bends the style. I'll be curious to age a bottle or two and to try this side by side with DH's Three Guy when that is bottle again."
"O: Unfortunately this just isn't my type of DIPA. It's too malty and earthy and not a big citrus hop bomb like I want out of my DIPAs. If you like the heavier, maltier DIPAs, however, this might be the perfect beer for you. Just beware of how huge it is."
"Overall: I nice try....nothing I would rave over but fairly good...quite aggressive"
"Pours reddish brown with a finger of whitish head. Looks good. The nose is hoppy, but not overly so, and big, rich sugary malt, represented by an almost raisin-like flavor. Taste is hoppy and malt sweet. I get big raisin, especially in the finish and maybe a touch of apple. What I don't get, which is truly remarkable, is booze. Like at all. Try this at cellar temp and it is just an amazing Triple IPA/American Barleywine (it's 13.6% ABV according to the bottle). Just a preposterously drinkable enormous beer. It's not the best tasting DIPA, I have ever had, but that's probably not a reasonable comparison category. I mean, it kind of tastes like an Imperial Knuckle Sandwich, even though this is already an Imperial IPA. The mouthfeel has good carb and kind of a sugary coating with its big body. Overall, are you serious? How did they make this beer? This is an impressive feat in brewing."
"Fresh hops hit the nose right away in the aroma, with some flowery citrus notes. First swallow reveals more hops and plenty of alcohol esters, with creamy malts and a depth of grain flavor approaching a barley wine. Caramel, brown bread and tangy grapefruit flavor intermingle on the palate, leaving a bittersweet essence. Well balanced considering the high gravity (this bottle is labeled at 13.6%), this DIPA is a pleasure to drink."
"OA: The only thing this beer is lacking IMO is the finale, from the characteristics I got from the scent I was expecting a nice warm finish from this beer, but it just wasn't there. All in all this is still a great beer."
"O: I love this beer! The taste was awesome! A very well balanced DIPA, especially for 12% ABV. Definitely try if you like DIPA's. Good job Dark Horse!"
"O - this is a great brew well rounded probably not worth the price tag in MA but worth trying."
"O - Not a bad offering from Dark Horse. While not my favorite DIPA by any means this still isn't a bad brew. Search elsewhere for somethign magical."
"O- This beer is dangerously drinkable. A wonderfully balanced Double IPA that stays within the style while pushing the ABV envelope. A great, early spring release that takes a bit of the chill out of the air. Well worth the premium price tag."
"Overall: A superior beer. The high ABV makes it a sipper, for sure (which is good, because I only bought the one 12-ounce). The thing is, you can actually enjoy this one!"
"There are few beer that I think smell way way better than they taste but this is one of them. The beer doesn't taste bad, I feel let down though by the complex hoppy aroma. The finish of the beer is a little dry, mild bitterness, overall fine. The start of the beer is interesting and mildly malty but there is almost nothing in the midpalate. Overall it was decent but a let down in the flavor. I'd cautiously try it again."
"Am certainly glad I requested 3 bottles of this fine brew. Looking forward to sharing the other two with some fellow BeerAdvocates."
"O: This goes down to easy for the high alcohol. Should be a sipper, but hard not to slam this down."
"A pretty solid beer, but not a standout in the category."
"Drinkability - I like this one. I have one more that I want to age and compare, looking forward to that as well."
"O: This is a very good MALTY DIPA. The bitterness could use a boost in my opinion. Drinkability is amazing @ 13.6 % ABV. If I didnt know any better I would have guessed this was a Hoppy Barleywine. Im going to age two and see is I end up with a world class Barleywine in five years."
"o - good dipa and one i think could actually pretty well."
"O: I had this fresh and am enjoying it more now. Have 2 more in the cellar so we will see where this goes but I enjoyed it."
"Wading in the Velvet Sea - Phish (Hampton Comes Alive '98)"
"A great tasting beer that is a great sipper. Drinks more like a barleywine than a DIPA however. A little difficult to find, but anytime I'm in MI, it's something I'd definitely seek out when I'm at a Scilianos type of store (but not go out of my way)"
"This beer pours somewhere in between murky amber and ruby red. The off white head quickly dissipated to lace the glass. The aromas are instantly sharp, bitter hops and fade to a sweet caramel malt. It's also features some sweet pine. The flavors are in your face hoppy and sweet. The malts taste like butterscotch and caramel, not two of my favorite flavors. The pine is ok but the sweetness dominates. It's like a 90 minute on steroids. The alcohol is also in your face and not well hidden at all. It's a little thick in body for an IPA and could be considered """chewy""" for the style. To me this beer is too much. I don't like overly sweet IPAs and this is one sweet IPA. The alcohol is overly present and kind of overpowering. For what it's worth, I think that this beer is better on tap."
"Overall: The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Hard to believe this is 13.6%. This beer is syrupy smooth, and while I am not crazy about American Double/Imperial IPA's, this one is top notch. I really enjoyed this beer the closer it got to room temp, and the balancing act between the malts and hops really came to the forefront."
"Overall there are few beers that I can match up with this on quality. Maybe enjoying it in Dark Horse's pub had something to do with it, but my God, what an amazing beer."
"Beautiful, deep amber-red color. Thin, off-white head with mild carbonation. Piney, grapefruit hops and toasted caramel malts in the nose. Very layered hop aroma that seems to morph upon inhalation. Flavor is excellent and spot-on. Again, morphing hoppiness that starts piney and moves to grapefruit. Beautiful caramel and toasted malts that brings the beer back a bit. Dry, almost wood aged flavor on the finish. Alcohol is hidden extremely well. Body/mouthfeel FULL. Happy to be living next to one of the great beer states."
"Taste is still indeed pretty hoppy after a full year in the bottle and I cannot wait to try some of these fresh from this years batch when released. A very strong malt backbone furnished with heavy graham cracker pie crust; healthy caramelized sugars with cotton candy and a pine essence that gets you at the first touch to your tongue. This is good stuff, thanks Scoot1969! among all of your other goodies sent this one has been on my wants list the longest. I have a hard time picking out which hops are in here after a year but am thinking along the lines of Cascade and Palisade. Very nice stuff. After having the Scotty Karate Scotch ale a few weeks back, I can see some very strong similarities in Dark Horses Stronger ales with the biscuit flavors and am loving both of these. Well done Dark horse well done"
"Kinda wish this wasn't number 100, but thats okay, I've had some awesome beers on the way."
"Whew, this one is strong! The hops were somewhat muted by the caramel and candy sugar. Very barleywine like although the pine resiny hops were there in spirit. Mouthfeel is sticky, alcohol burn and medium body. This is a sipper, lots of alcohol but a good one to take slowly!"
"Taste, more hops, high alcohol, whoooo this is a burner."
"d - I liked this one a lot, but it was more of a barleywine than a DIPA in my opinion. Would have again."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, a little dry and sticky. This is a sipper for sure at 13.6%, and would be a bit easier to drink although its a little syrupy sweet for me. I've had this fresh and with some age on it, and this softened the heat but lost most of the hoppiness."
"overall - so glad I did this, and even happier that I have 3 more bottles to try down the road. 13.6% alcohol was hard to pick up on fresh, still the same in that regard."
"I am not sure this aged as well as I had hoped. It is smooth, to be sure, but it seems to have lost too much complexity."
"This is truly a treat and a great example of the style. Bitterness just takes over everything and then there is this nice marriage of hops and caramel malts while still pushing the envelope."
"D: Quite a huge beer ABV wise for a DIPA. A sipper, but a good one at that. This one left me wanting a little more hop punch."
"Pours a hazy reddish copper orange with a fine head. Big, ripe, zesty nose...candied orange, pine, big hops, some mint or something. Quite sweet in the mouth, reminds me of rock candy. Candied orange, pine sap, some lingering bitterness but quite sweet overall. Tends toward an American barleywine. A sipper. Good stuff."
"Drinkability- decent sipper, but the abv is waay too high for me. The alcohol kind of takes over.."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Although this isn't exactly what I look for in an Ipa, it's still good. That being said, it's not worth the price tag IMO. Reminds me a lot of Stoudts Double Ipa. If you're a fan of high alcohol Ipa's that are more balanced, you might want to seek this out."
"D- Overall a very interesting brew. An IPA with enough umph to age? Might have to give that a try..."
"Drinks: like a smack in the mouth, followed by a hug. Double Crooked Tree's got big flavors but is incredibly mellow at the same time. I'm in awe of this beer."
"overall, this was a great beer i really enjoyed. But whoa one at a time this is no where near a session"
"Overall: Surprising in overall presentation and flavoring, while delightfully refreshing for a DIPA. Left me wanting another."
"This brew has aged wel, into something other than a DIPA hop bomb, very nice."
"D: I love the flavors in this beer, and it's not quit a chore to drink, but there's no way I'd want to have a bottle of this every day. As far as a DIPA goes, it's closer to hopped-up barleywine. Glad I got to try this. Thanks again Jay!"
"Super underwhelming beer... not a big fan."
"Draft. Poured from a fresh, brand new tap line. Pours a slightly hazed orange amber color with a wispy white coastered head. Malty sweet smelling with a touch of citrus rind hop aroma. The taste is slightly unbalanced in terms of malt vs hops and I wish it had a more hoppy bite. Not a bad ipa but not the best either."
"Overall, I love this beer. As with most beers in this category (DFH 120 minute, Founders Devil Dancer, etc.) this really blurs the line between IIPA/barleywine, though I'd argue this is the most accessible of the bunch, not only for newer people to the style, but those who are turned off by highly-hopped/high alcohol beers. I'd also add that this is really drinkable fresh, unlike 120 minute which to me is a big overpowering mess. Well worth the $15/4-pack which I paid."
"This beer pairs well with High on Fire radio, on last.fm."
"Drinkability: The bitter-sweet character that emerges along with the high ABV limit my consumption. If you get it in a bottle, it may age well."
"Deep hazy amber-brown beer. Thin white head. Big juicy hop aroma, grapefruit, brown sugar/toffee and a touch of light oak as well. Flavor is really much more barleywine than IIPA. Toasty rich malts, a bit of dark fruit and sweet caramel maltiness. Moderate bitterness with a fresh grapefruity/orange citrus component. Lingering sweetness. Heavy duty."
"Great big DIPA. Definetely has faded a bit since fresh, but is still delicious. Can really only drink 1-2 due to the ABV"
"The beer is a medium brown color with a thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of hops, caramel, brown sugar, some citrus and a touch of alcohol. The taste starts out sweet with flavors of brown sugar, caramel and bourbon, then the hops flavor comes in, but it's no where near as strong as you would expect. Then there's a slight alcohol burn, but it's quite tame for a beer with 13.60% ABV. The malt character seems on the thin side despite the sweetness. The after-taste is bitter sweet. Crisp and very smooth, medium body, light-to-medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish."
"Overall, this is a nice DIPA, and one of the highest ABV 12ozers I've had in a long time."
"Because of the aftertaste I gave it a lower rating on drinkability but overall a very nice beer."
"DB- A nice beer but it is still a bit too hoppy even for me, I don't say that often (Hop Dam, Devil Dancer). There is a point where hops just taste like hops and not complex fruity, piney flavors. It wears you down, I cannot review another one after this, beast-mode of ales. It has aged fine, it probably has enough hops for about 10 years."
"As huge as this beer is, each sip is a breeze...delicious, smooth, and luscious. I think this is the most drinkable DIPA I've laid my lips upon."
"It is actually has a great flavor and has aged well, but it is not super hoppy, which is what I had gleefully anticipated. Good stuff all the same."
"The 12% ABV is what's on the website,and why it is sellable in Ohio. Perhaps the 2009 edition was 13.6%...this isn't"
"Had to step back from this beer and take a second to look at my review after I was done. As a DIPA it's pretty near a complete fail but after logging on to post my review and seeing how insanely high the ABV is and looking at my notes this is actually fairly decent as a Barleywine. No reason to judge the beer too negatively because they put the wrong label on it."
"Well-crafted and insanely drinkable for the ABV."
"Eric"
"D- Moderate. I really like the flavors here, but it might be too much. That being said, I'll buy some more of this next time it comes around. The 4pk dissapeared rather quickly."
"Quite drinkable, I'm enjoying this one and would gladly have another."
"This is good, but a bit too bitter for me. Devil Dancer would be a nice alternative. The mouthfeel is just sharp and not pleasant. You can """feel""" this beer on your tongue. Maybe a bitter hophead's dream, but not mine."
"Drinks lighter than its abv. One would certianly be good but a couple in a sitting would not be the worst thing in the world. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer is very boozy to the point that it's boozy to be boozy. It doesn't compliment the beer and makes it tough to drink. After all the hype when this was released earlier this year I'm now glad I found a single (seemingly illegally) for $3.99 rather than paying $15.99 or whatever it was for a 4-pack. Not impressed here."
"D/M: It is creamy, but did not have a lot of carbonation. Its a sipper for sure. Overall I liked it, but am guessing that it may be a bit old. Did not find a bottling date on it, and would be more than willing to give it another shot on a fresh bottle. If what I drank is what it normally is supposed to taste like, I will pass in the future."
"D: To be honest, this is more like a barleywine then it is a DIPA. Given the alcohol, it's pretty drinkable, but I'd stop at one. Definitely worth a try"
"When I think of DIPA, I go to Pliny the Elder, Dreadnaught, Hopslam and Arctic Panzer Wolf. Those are a varied bunch to be sure, but they all fit the style guidelines. This one does not seem to be able to squeeze in there to me."
"Best to share one of these bad boys or risk overloading the taste buds. Still, I feel up to the challenge."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall, a fine offering from Dark Horse. I'm not sure if I've had anything else by them but I'll definitely be more conscious of their name going forward."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Says 13.6% ABV, but that's illegal in Ohio (one can only hope it's true...) so 12% it is, and even at that this brew is completely epic!"
"Double crooked tree arrives at my table deep amber with woody ruby tones and a nice sticky and frothy white head. The head has great staying power and leaves gloopy lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is quite malty and sweet, with a lot of caramel malt characteristics. It also carries with it a piney and grapefruit hop character that mingles well with the maltier aromas to give it a sort of candied citrus quality. It also has a definite hint of booze that cuts through as I sniff gently. The taste is sweet, but not as sweet as I had anticipated. The malty character is full of caramel and toffee, as well as a bit of raisin. The bitterness does manage to come through some, and accentuates some nice grapefruit and pine hop flavors. This is not a hop bomb double, but it is also far from some of the more barleywine-esc offerings on the market. The body is on the heavier side of medium, and surprisingly smooth with a finish that is perfectly balanced and not too sticky or slick. The alcohol definitely shows itself, but it is not too distracting. Far from sessionable, but a nice sipper. For a concept beer, this one turned out pretty darn well."
"D-for a brew nearly 14% alcohol its pretty damn drinkable. But still, 14% is 14%. Every time I took a sip I grinned to my buddies at the bar. They weren't as excited as I was."
"D: If the ABV was lower, this would score higher on drinkability."
"This is one of the better dipas out there."
"Reminds me of Devil Dancer but way less harsh. Very drinkable for 13.6%."
"Rust brown color into a Unibroue tulip glass. Head is tan and light with medium to large bubbles at about an eighth inch thick. Not getting much in aroma, could be a bit cold. Going to let it warm up a bit. Roasted barley is starting to come through, on the flavor side is a sharp alcohol flavor and medium malt taste with lots of bitter hops and very little on the floral / citrus side of things. This beer tastes fairly fresh as there is a crispness to the hops. Caramel and dark fruits, especially plum, now that the beer has had a chance to warm up. Aroma is now thick malt and candied sugars."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer, that can be argued as a DIPA or a barleywine. Either way this beer goes down far too easy for it's abv. Very drinkable, which could lead to problems if you have more than one in a short period of time."
"Dark copper to brown bodied, khaki colored head of decent size lasts and laces. The scent is sweet caramel malts being watched over by serious citrus and bitter hops. The entire tongue is hit hard with taste when this brew hits it. Pretty big caramel malt character, but the main focus is on an intense hop profile, citrus and bitter, plenty of fruit notes. Creamy mouth, medium to full bodied. The 13.6% explains a hearty dose of warming alcohol as well. This beer is a bit pricy, but it is also very good."
"Got it via a trade, thanks folks. Pours a deep caramely amber (i think thats a color), smell was a sweet malt with some booziness. Wasn't quite sure what to expect on this, wasn't even on my radar, but very pleased with getting one a trying it. Taste was a typical DIPA, but with a very palatable booze finish, is this really +13%. The big malts balance this out, good stuff, i'll be on the lookout for more."
"5.0 D: This is easily the best drinking American barleywine I've had due to the incredible balance of bitterness and malt sweetness. Alcohol very well hidden. Great beer."
"After noticing that my rDev for this review was nearly negative 30%, I think this one deserves an explanation. To really be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of barleywines. I'm much, much more of a DIPA guy - DIPAs with balance, malt backbone, and fresh, explosive, citrus hops. But whether this one is a DIPA or a barleywine, either way it is just too sweet for me."
"D: This is definitely one I would do again. I got this one a bit too cold before serving, so I am letting it warm as I drink it. Very good balance between hops and malt. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I would have another, and would love to imbibe one at the peak of its freshness to see if the hops are more present. However, I am nearing the end of an hour session with this beer and the a.b.v. is starting to get to me. Overall, a nice double IPA."
"Not the most drinkable DIPA, but it is unique. It seems to border the taste of a barleywine or old ale."
"HV"
"On tap, this is a pretty impressive beer. It is comfortably in the company of some of the Midwestern heavy hitters. I was thrilled to find this on tap & looking back, I may have allowed my excitement get the best of objectivity. Indeed; Double Crooked Tree is really quite sweet which didn't fully register until a few additional pints."
"A: Semi-thick layer of foam, medium amber with a hint of red, signs of miniscule sediment floating in the glass - 4.50, Scrumptious aroma, heaps of citrusy hops matched by an equal quantity of caramelly malts, lots of tropical fruits including papaya and pineapple, alcohol is faint but noticeable, slight rum soaked date smell, truly the nose of a double IPA - 4.75, T: Solid hop bite - a tongue shredder balanced with layers of thick and syrupy sweetness, tastes like golden raisins, slight burn on the tongue, could quite easily be mistaken for a heavily hopped barleywine - 4.25, M: Creamy with a heavy mouth feel - 4.00, D: All around this is a very nice sipper, holds its high alcohol content very well - 4.50"
"M/D - nice carbonation and mouthfeel, there seems to be a bit of a boozy finish along with all of the hop and malt flavor. I'll definitely seek this one out again."
"D- This beer is probably a bit too easy to drink. I'd say a sipper but I had no problem drinking this one. Recommended for sure."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Thick appearance which carries throughout the taste and feel. Deep copper color, opaque with scant light brown head. Smell is elusive - hops, pine, some hints of fruit. Taste is much stronger than expected from the smell and much less harsh than abv would suggest. Caramel and sweet syrup balance the hops and alcohol very nicely. Also picking up tea and apricot flavors. Feel is thick and warm. Gonna only have one but could go for a couple."
"Future outlook: I might have to snag a few of these to age and see what that does to it. A real winner for a big DIPA."
"Pours a murky orangy brown, minimal head but sticky sheets of thin lacing. Scent is of bitter piney and earthy hops with a kiss of grapefruit, solid sweet carmely malt backbone. Taste is a big push of bitter earthy and piney hops, the grapefruit is there, but covered by a significant taste of alcohol. The backbone is a sweet carmel malts, they are there in quanity but hidden by the bitterness of the hops and alcohol burn. bitter and hot aftertaste present, medium bodied, adequate carbonation. A nice beer, but a little too bitter and hot which covers up the pleasent tastes."
"Drinkability is good, but as much as it hides the huge abv, this is a monster beer. One to be sipped and savored. Beautifully done."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best with that super high ABV. I think I may actually prefer this in the bottle as opposed to the tap as the body had a bit more going for it, but overall, it was a great experience getting to drink this in the brewpub that it comes from."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (no bottle date) into a snifter glass. Pours a dark ruby amber with some yeast sediment that sneaked through while pouring. Not a lot of hop in the aroma (aged bottle?), lots of caramel and sweet malts with a little grapefruit and pine. A nice explosion of sweet caramel malts with a nice smooth creamy body and hop bite. Very nice drinker for a high ABV. Tastes more like a Barleywine though, yum!"
"OK, so it's not true DIPA, or a true barleywine. But it's damn good once you get past any preconceptions. Go go get get double double crooked tree. Then then you you will will see see."
"FFO Southern Tier UnEartlhly and big East Coast Impy IPAs."
"Pours a deep, dark amber with two fingers of tan head that did not move until I took a sip. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. This smells like one of those hopped up barleywines. Pungent citrus and pine hop aromas combat the sweet malt for dominance. The hops and malt somehow supresses the whopping 13.5% ABV. Doubling ingredients to make a bigger beer does not necessarily makes a better beer. The bitterness, sweetness, and alcohol just makes this too much to take in. My tastebuds are conflicted. The bottle states that this beer ages well, maybe it would be better when the hops fade and becomes a straight forward barleywine. Has a very good mouthfeel. Thick and rich with a smooth carbonation and texture. Very nice but cannot hold the flavors together. Worth a try, maybe I should get another bottle and forget about it for a few years."
"average drinkability, perhaps slightly below average considering alcohol and lack of carbination."
"drinkablility: Only problem is the high ABV. This beer is complex, smooth, rich, textured, lively and hedonistic. Great attack on the palate and smooth finish gives this beer such a great depth of character. Seek this one out immediately!"
"D. For a DIPA, it's very drinkable due to the fairly good balance. Plus, it's a freakin' 13.6% beer; I never would have guessed that it was that high - until halfway through the pint when I started to feel the affects of drinking this too quickly. Delicious - 1 more please."
"For being high in Abv and a year old, most people at the tasting did not like this beer. I did, thought it was fine to drink. Wish the abv was a little lower but it didnt detract from the taste all that much."
"Overall, this is a quality brew from Dark Horse and the first that I've had from this brewery. The beer itself goes beyond the typical DIPA and almost borders on being a barleywine. The bottle says this ages well and I'm sure it does. Hopefully I can find another bottle the next time I hit up the liquor store. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a more """aggressive""" DIPA."
"The excess grass taste on the tongue may not be my thing, but after that this is a very decent beer and one worth a try."
"Drinkablility is good but not great. It's a great beer but the alcohol will get you."
"Drinkability is good, there's nothing really wrong with this beer that a stronger dose of hops wouldn't help. Closer to East than West Coast in style due to the more balanced nature. While there are good hops flavor present, the sweet, strong malt flavor makes it seem like less than there is."
"the drinkability is remarkable for the size of this beer, i honestly drank it like i would a 6% IPA. it's fantastically balanced, and finley crafted. not a double IPA for those of us looking for a hop bomb though. it's very hoppy, but it keeps itself in check."
"D: overall was a pretty decent DIPA but still lacked on the hoppy punch. Was a little bit to sweet with not enough hops playing a bigger role."
"To be honest, I was slightly let down by this. I'd heard people raving about it, and it didn't completely deliver for me. It's a well-made beer, and enjoyable, but it doesn't satisfy my hop craving like I thought it would. That said, give it a try for yourself. From what I've heard and read, there's a relatively high amount of variance in different people's reaction to this brew."
"Drinkability is like cooking bacon - deliciously low and slow."
"D - What more can I say than this beer is HUGE. That's the best word to describe it. Everything about it is gigantic and it lives up to the big scary medieval sci-fi monster art on the bottle. Infinitely well hopped. I'm shocked this one didn't get an A or an A+ from the Bros. This is great. Smooth and strong.You DO feel the alcohol after even just half a beer and you probably can't have more than 2. But my oh my. This brew is a man among boys. If beer flowed through the River Styx, this is the beer that'd flow through it."
"D--enjoyable glass, but it's a sipper and I will spread out my 4-pack in individual tastings"
"Creamy texture, really interesting for a double ipa. Rich texture, mild carbonation is just right. Texture matches well with the flavor. This is a dense beer, the alcohol is dangerously well disguised but the richness helps keep me from getting plastered. I will definitely pick up more of it, especially with its potential for a long shelf life."
"This one really surprised me. I expected it to be very sweet due to residual sugars but that wasn't the case at all. As mentioned above the heat blended perfectly with the piney hops! A gem!"
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised how good this beer was. Dark Horse is a small brewery often overshadowed by its next door neighbor, Bell's. I think this beer may help change that and give them a little more attention/respect. I would highly recommend this beer."
"Sticky body, but not overly mouth filling. For a beer this big it is very drinkable. Alcohol is not present and it slides down very well. Could be very dangerous stuff."
"D - I'm usually skeptical of any """double the original recipe""" beers, but this one works for me. It could still use some additional bittering and aroma hops, in my opinion, and it gets a little boozy toward the end of the glass, but overall, it's an enjoyable beer."
"D-I like this beer. It has an oakey richness that lingers in a good way. With its high ABV this could be a dangerous brew...oh well!"
"Overall Impression: I loved all aspects of this wonderfully crafted brew from Dark Horse & would suggest you go out & try it for it for yourself."
"Really glad I got to try this one. It fell a little short of my expectations. I love the regular Crooked Tree IPA and I'll probably grab the double again if I have the opportunity, but I won't seek it out."
"Because of it's size I have to hold down the drinkability scores. I'd like to score this a little above 4.0, but I wouldn't/can't change any of my individual scores as they accurately describe my experience, so I'll leave as is. Might this be closer to an American Strong Ale?"
"goes down better than I expected from the first couple sips. not that they were bad, just rather strong. but everything is in balance enough to make you keep sipping. alcohol is there, but not too strong. overall, a powerful beer."
"The beer pours a clear orange color with an off-white head. The aroma is orange citrus hops with some caramel malt. I also get some pineapple in the aroma. The flavor is sweet orange with low-medium bitterness. No detectable alcohol, making this a dangerous beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall very nice. Glad I scored a few of these."
"This is darker than most of the Triple IPA's I've come across at 12% abv (per the website) and as dark as this one pours this is a midwest monster of a beer. Deep amber bodey with a large khaki tan head forming nice above the rim of my Chimay chalice, lacing is fine and even with each sip. Aromatics bring it with extreme grapefruit/pine hop tones off the bat. Deep rich hoppiness wrapped with layers of caramel malt tones. Alcohol esters are evident but it doesn't seem fusel actually well meshed all things considered. Flavor again meshes things extremely well abeit a bit sweet, it still works with the grapefruit/pine/resinous feel it has going down, a bit of alcohol warms you up but doesn't overpower the show and the malts range from caramel to straight concentrated citrus juice sweetness...hop candy for sure. Full bodied soft even carbonation the alcohol does end a bit boozey especially as it warms, this is definitely a DIPA/TIPA that borders as a a barleywine/Old Ale. The only difference here is hops, that is what really defines itself as more of an exponential IPA. I threw the yeast more than ample yeast sediment into the glass after swirling the last pour from the bottle it really murks things up in a good way, one of the most drinkable and unoffensive high alcohol, highly hopped brews I've come across. The hop burps are a thing of beauty, this is up there with my Moylan's Hopsickle experience."
"Notes: Wow, a great I.P.A. Mouth feels a little worked after this one, but it was worth it."
"D - A good DIPA but somewhat strong."
"Pours a dark red, doesn't look like an ipa or iipa at all. Hardly any head at all, probably more to do with the pour than the actual beer, as I've had this befoe in bottle and there has been plenty. Smells are hops, malts and a little fruit, maybe some plums. I taste some hops in the front, a little caramel and a slight hoppy finish. Delicious. Mouthfeel is thick, but not overly thick with slight carbonation, feels really good. This beer would be drinkable as an """average""" abv beer, at 13% this is unbelievable drinkable. It should be a sipper, but it's so damn smooth you need to watch out."
"I will say this. For 13% ABV you will not find a more drinkable beer than this. It is so well hidden you forget that this a bit of a monster."
"D: This is quite nice for a super big DIPA (or triple IPA?). It is well balanced and a little too easy to drink (for the ABV)."
"D: Very good considering its high ABV."
"PLus I need something to erase the Penguin score from my memory. Beter luck next year. This is a great DIPA with hops,malt, and sweetness to rank up there with the best of them."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle at Local Option. Pours clear amber with no head. Smells super hoppy and malty with bitterness and brown sugar, lemon and orange oil. Flavors are actually just as the nose would suggest with low carbonation, a heavy body and a long bitter and sweet finish. This beer is awesome!"
"All in all-- this year's batch doesn't seem as big on the fresh hops as last year, but it is still pretty good."
"A little steep on price but definitely worth it for such an interesting and high ABV double IPA. The alcohol became a bit powering as it warmed up, but it also helped intensify some of the cool flavors that this beer holds."
"Overall, a bit on the sweet side for a DIPA, but nicely balanced and very smooth for the high(13.6!) ABV. Drink with caution! This beer will slap you around if you don't respect it."
"F: Piny and heavy citrus hops, lots of hop oil and resin feel lingers as well with some fresh musty hops. Some spicy hops late on the finish with chewy hops too. It's basically almost every hop combined into one on the taste and they all seem to linger a bit. Some sweetness on the finish with a little malts, but surprisingly doesn't dry with the heavy hop and bitterness. A great drinking beer, with lots of hops all of the hops you can think of, lots of pine, citrus, citrus fruits, earthy, chewy, fresh musty, etc. Lighter on the malt flavors, but some malt backbone which is nice, and drinks like 7%, not friggen... wait, that has to be wrong... really?! It's 13.6%??? Are you sure they got the decimal place right?! Damn!"
"Don't let this amazingly delicious and easy (easier than most double IPAs) to drink brew pass you by; yet, don't forget... at such a high ABV, this beer will sneak up on you. I don't normally rank Michigan brews, but I do have to say this is up there as one of my top 5. Kudos to Dark Horse for producing an amazing beverage. As this gains traction, I only continue to see them providing more top-notch brews, on the same level as Double Crooked Tree. Enjoy this beer. You won't be disappointed."
"D: Definitely a sipper, and while each rated component is above average or better, the flavor is not palatable enough to ensure long term drinkability. All in all, I'm pretty impressed with Dark Horse's mega monster DIPA. If they would bring down the ABV a bit, I'm sure they could tame this beast."
"Poured from a bottle into my Duvel tulip. Double Crooked Tree pours a murky reddish brown, what little off-white head that does form fades just as quickly. Smell is predominantly piney hops. Double Crooked Tree almost reminds me of an american barleywine as much as a double IPA. Piney, earthy hops and a touch of alcohol dominate the taste (the alcohol does fade a bit as the beer warms), although there's surprising enough amount of malt present asl well. It's not quite perfect, but the mouth feel is damn good, a very pleasant level of carbonation. Double Crooked Tree is very good beer, but between the booziness and the hop bitterness I couldn't imagine having more than one in one sitting"
"12 ounce bottle from Capones, just north of Philly, Pa. No freshness/vintage info to be had. Pours darker almond amber, pretty clear, under a nice, dense dark tan head, that has retentive notions and leaves all kinds of splotches and bits of fine lacing. Rum soaked orange infused nose. Yummy, warming, densely flavorful with waves of malty under coatings juxtaposed with more then adequate and biting bittering hops. Hops here are grainy and tea drenched. Heady stuff and I like it."
"Poured into a pint glass, it appears an amber color with orange hues around the edges. Clear for the most part with faint particles stuck in suspension. The tanned head is composed mostly of large bubbles that pop and fade quickly despite the rising bubbles of carbonation. Minimal to no lacing is found on the glassware. The aroma is a spicy zap of citrus, floral and piney hops combined with alcohol and malty sweetness. Taste is fairly bitter upfront tasting oily for the most part with an alcohol kick that supports the aggressive bitterness. Malty sweetness is evident but plays a much lighter role in this beer when compared to the bold alcohol presence and hop bitterness. The alcohol is not hidden at all, it is evident in both flavor and warmth. The alcohol seemingly evaporates out of your mouth leaving a cool feeling however it warms the back of the throat as well. Hops present themselves a bit resinous and linger in the mouth long after each sip with a taste that is somewhat herbal. The feel of this beer is medium with moderate to light carbonation. Overall not bad."
"D- this is a very dangerous beer. I could have easily killed six of these. It drinks really nice. I wish dark horse would start distributing to FL!"
"This beer is worthy and worth having !!"
"From what I remember this beer is the best thing Dark Horse has ever done! It is the DIPA to rule them all. There is a cascade of hops, all sorts of fruits and a dash of pine that just make this beer stand out. Definitely not for the novice because this beer will knock you on your floor!"
"Tasty stuff and definitely something I'm looking forward to trying again."
"For a 12% beer it hides the alcohol fairly well. It's not a super hoppy beer like other Imperial IPA's, but is well balanced and pretty easy to drink. I'd like a bit more hop flavor and aroma in this beer. Otherwise, it's quite good."
"D: I don't quite get the love people have for it; maybe if it's uber-fresh it is a winner, but if the hops fade even a little bit, it starts to taste like a barleywine. Not my style."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer is going to get low marks because it just doesn't fit the DIPA category. It is a poor IPA. I am disappointed. I have had other Dark Horse Brews and they were better."
"12oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Poured a deep chestnut/mahogany with a one inch, creamy, off-white head that exhibits excellent retention. Nose starts out sweet - citrus, cotton candy and a slight earthy/piny hops character at the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, the way the flavors express themselves are very interesting. Sweet and bitter is muddled at the beginning then sweet reappears, as well as some alcohol heat, followed by citrus, sugar and a light lingering, slightly medicinal bitterness - all on a malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly creamy/oily texture and a carbonation level that approaches prickly, but is somewhat diminished by the texture. Tasty and complex, with a well-hidden abv at 13.6%. Very enjoyable, but the roller coaster ride of the flavor profile slightly diminishes the drinkability, although not appreciably."
"This seems more like a very hoppy American Barleywine than a DIPA in many ways. I'm certainly going to put at least one bottle away for a couple years to see what happens with it. As a DIPA, I think aroma particularly is lacking, but the beer is flavorful and enjoyable. Definitely a one-and-done situation, particularly given the ABV."
"Summary: Wow! I need to have this again and again. All I can think of is Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water, because this is one classic kick ass brew. After drinking the beers that i enjoyed at the brewpub...I believe that this one beer epitomizes Dark Horse Brewing. I highly recommend it."
"D: Very heavy sipping beer, a bit more malty than what I would expect in a big IPA. From the bottle, it says that it can be cellared -- it would be interesting to see how the beer ages."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just ok. The high ABV and sugary sweetness will limit it some. Overall, I really liked this beer. I just can't see this as a DIPA, it really should be classified as a barleywine IMHO. I am glad I have a couple of these, but I would have liked to have tried this when it was super fresh rather than a couple months old. Skal."
"Overall impression: I'd love to see the lupulin ratched up and the booze/sweetness ratched down, but it's an interesting take on the style."
"Drinkability - There is just a hint of alcohol I can taste but overall, for a 12% beer, I can barely taste the alcohol and have almost zero warming as I take sips. This beer packs an insane punch yet it doesn't appear to. I'm really glad I was able to try this and would pick this up again if I saw it. A pretty interesting DIPA that goes down nice and easy. Cheers!"
"D: This DIPA cought me off guard at first! The one I'm reviewing is the second one I have ever had. Just like the first one I've got a buzz (on a empty stomach) and I'm only half way threw! I do like this DIPA! I would pick up another one 4-pack next season."
"I like this but want more of a hoppy nose from it. I enjoy the regular crooked tree more. I can't speak for when this was bottled but this bottle is definitely more malt forward then hoppy."
"Drinkability - This beer is 13.6% abv?! This is by a wide margin THE most drinkable beer I've ever had at this strength. One of the better DIPA's I've come across, not so much for its complexity, but for how easy it is to drink."
"D: Not very drinkable as compared to most DIPA's (yes I know it is 12%). Just seems to fill the stomach more than most for some reason"
"M/D: Fairly full bodied. A little creamy and smooth feeling from the lower carbonation. There is a touch of alcohol in the finish but that is to be expected at 13/6% abv, seems like its almost half that which is scary. Good drinkability for how strong it is, only a 4 because you will really be feeling it if you have two in a row."
"D: A really great session beer if I've ever had one. The high alcohol content warns you off from having any more then two of these powerhouses though."
"D: Very drinkable. Great flavor and smoothness. A little thick and sticky on the palate brings it down just a tad."
"Gotta love Michigan beer!"
"D- Very good beer from Dark Horse, Bravo! This is not an easy drinker however. But no one said it would be. Its warm with alcohol, syrupy thick, huge on both malts and hops. This is not a beginners beer and I love it."
"Who cares how drinkable this beer is; you only need one! Really, this is a pleasure to drink; the buzz is a bonus. The balance in flavors and aromas is mind-blowing to me. Aged this might start to become more of a Barleywine, but at 2 months fresh this is to me what a DIPA should be! Ive had on tap also and remember it being even better."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's a very good tasting beer with some very nice flavors. It's especially drinkable considering the abv."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy hops (orange, grapefruit, tropical fruit) and caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's some pine and herbal hops noticable too. There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Also, the maltiness in the taste is stronger than I thought it would be. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit heavy and syrupy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. The high ABV isn't noticable at all in the taste or aroma. I think this is a good, solid overall brew."
"D: Not what I was expecting, but still good. Hops are toned done quite a bit, while the alcohol is turned up. However, while the alcohol is rather prevalent, it is not distracting. IMO, the main flaw is the sweetness - I can handle the alcohol, but the sweetness is just too much."
"D: An easy sipper surprisingly, alcohol didn't burn the nose and ask for mercy. Hops were very lovely with the malts."
"Drinks more like a fresh barleywine than a double/imperial IPA in my opinion. Very heavy malt presence and kind of light on bitter hops. Tasty, but not what I'd grab when going for an IPA."
"The beer pours an amber copper color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose there is some noticeable alcohol, but otherwise I get some earth, citrus and some noticeable sweet malt. The flavors replicate the nose pretty well, but with a bit more sweet malt then I normally like to see. Still, considering the abv., this beer is not as heavy and tiring on the palate as I might normally expect. Also, the combination of sweet malt and siginificant hoppy bitterness impart some nice tropical flavors of cherry and bannana. The beer finishes fairly well, with a decent amount of bitterness. Drinkability is pretty good, though the sweet malt and noticeable alcohol detract just a bit. Nothing spectacular here, but nice enough..."
"Medium to full bodied, sweet, and smooth. Has proper carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden for 13.6 %. I have the rest of the 4 pack to finish, with no complaints at all. This is another solid offering from Dark Horse."
"Overall a decent IPA. Would get a pint if I saw it somewhere but I won't be seeking it out in a trade."
"If you like everything double, for real double, this is for you."
"Pours a hazy redwood color with some off-white head. Ok lacing. Smell is pretty good, big citrus and floral hops, a bit of solvent. Some maltiness in there too, caramel and slightly roasted malt too. Taste is slightly disappointing (but good, I had big expectations), big malt in there to balance out the hops. The hops don't come out with as much flavor as they do bitterness on this guy. Big caramel malt, a bit spicy from some roasted malt, and some citrus, and some more piney hops too. Not terrible, but I'd rather have something else. Medium mouthfeel, smooth, though nothing incredible. Drinkability is tremendous for a 14% beer, alleykatking told me it drinks like 7% and I agree. A good beer, glad to try it!"
"Poured a hazy amber with a off white head. lacing on the glass with every sip. Aroma is a floral bouquet with citrus coming through. Intense floral and citrus hop flavor with a very balanced malt flavor and bitterness. Extremely drinkable for 13.6%. Outstanding, but could be just a bit more aroma and hop flavor IMHO."
"D - Scary good for a beer this high in ABV. I had a smoothie for dinner about 7 hours ago, took a small nap, and this should knock me out real quick. Just what I was looking for."
"D. Given the """extremeness""" here the drinkability is actually quite high. So many beers like this become a chore to drink after a few ounces. Not this stuff - my glass disappeared way too fast. That said, this is still a sipping beer that is best consumed in moderation. HopSlam is my reference DIPA - Double Crooked Tree holds its own against it. Highly recommended."
"D- damn its impressive that this pulls in at so big an abv. Not much heat at all. Really big beer with very dialed in flavor."
"Somewhat smooth, but relatively harsh on the palate, even for a DIPA. I am used to having my palate thrashed, but that is by bitterness, not because of the overwhelming alcohol flavors. I couldn't even finish the whole snifter's pour. There are much better and well-balanced double IPAs out there. Seek them out and exhaust those options before you pursue this one, unless you just want a fast buzz."
"I poured a bottle of this beer into my snifter. The beer was a nice dark copper color, almost like a glass of Iced Tea. It had about an inch tall fluffy head on it that clung to the sides of the glass. The head disappeared quickly. The scent was an interesting blend of fruits with a touch of pine and earthy aroma. A complex scent that blended together to make me think of Pineapple. The flavor exhibited to me a nice spicy hop with hints of citrus upfront that turned to a piney/grassy aftertaste with a slight hint of malt. I can barely taste any alcohol presence which is surprising to me due to the high ABV of this beer. The mouthfeel of this beer is awesome as it is very full and chewy. It feels, to me, as if I was biting into a nice piece of fruit. A bite that begins solid but liquefies as it touches the cheek and gums. If you enjoy DIPAs this one is very drinkable. The flavor is tasty and complex, while the hops and alcohol are not overpowering. The mouthfeel makes this beer feel very refreshing."
"D- The alcohol never really comes out which is kind of surprising but the flavor is good and goes down really well. I would have to say that I prefer this over Hopslam. A good offering you should seek out from Dark Horse."
"This is an unusual DIPA, sweeter, complex and no where near the bitterness (which I like, btw) of some. It might well grab some of you who think all DIPA's are of one ilk. Try it!"
"Pours a beautiful reddish-brown color, topped with a nice, creamy off-white head, which settles down into a lacy covering rather quickly. Huge hops immediately jump out of the glass, with big bubblegum notes, along with orange zest and just a bit of grapefruit. Huge complex flavors assault the palate from the get go...syrupy malt sweetness, honey, orange, grapefruit and alcohol are all quite evident. A true double IPA, and a very good one at that, although this is really too sweet to drink all night. Excellent."
"D - Can't believe this is a 13.6% beer...way too smooth. I find the alcohol to be hidden nicely behind the huge malt and hop character here. This one begs to be gulped, but probably should be sipped. I could see a 4pk of these disappearing at an alarming rate, and seriously paying for this indiscretion the next morning."
"Pours a dark, burnt caramel color with very little head. Cloudy with floaters. Smells subtly of graphite and floral hoppiness. Rich malty smell is there too, like caramel or molasses. The smell is better than I remember from y first tasting. Thick maltiness is balanced well by a nice trace of bitterness with definite fruity hoppiness. The little carbonation I get reminds me of sipping some true grapefruit juice at Sunday brunch. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and sweet. This is a very good Imperial IPA, my favorite style."
"Dark Horse has a huge winner here and I hope it starts to get more praise as more people try it. This is a world class beer."
"D_Unbelievably easy to drink for over 13% ABV."
"M/D - One of the few Dark Horse brews that I have had, big hop taste up front but settle's down pretty quick, a longer sipper for me since the ABV was so high but looking forward to trying the rest and update my review. A great beer that should be picked up if you can find it!! A for sure must try!!!"
"pours a dark amber slightly hazy color with a small head that dissipates quickly to a slight beige ring with minimal lacing...the smell is musty malt ,hop heavy citrus,some caramel and toffee.the taste is a malt first followed by a piney blast of citrus and hops..it has a boozy heat to it but it no way interferes with the smooth balance this dipa has..the mouth feel is full it well balanced..this dipa is way to drinkable both in flavor and balance..its a top tier dipa that is well balanced"
"Overall Impression: Huge malt backbone, balanced out nicely with herbal/citrus hops. Loved the caramel/toffee flavors in the finish. Was not as hoppy as I would have thought, but it worked! It was not cloying or unbalanced - very well done! If you like big malty beers, this one is a must!"
"Overall, this beer is awesome and drinkable. My pint went way to fast and I wanted more (but had to drive). This beer was well done. Tons of hop flavor done right. Worth a try if you can ever get a chance at it!"
"D- This is a very good beer-would have never guessed that this is a 13% monster. The flavor is big, sweet, and balanced. This actually reminds me of Burton Baton. Well put together."
"Pours a reddish orange with nice sized cream colored head that receeds quickly but leaves a nice bit of lacing. Smell is of citrusy hops and sweet malts. Also seem to be catching piney hops. The taste is very well balanced with an oily snap of hops being balanced with a malty/caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is oily (maybe a little much), and medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. 13.6% = wow. I did not realize it until I was looking at the bottle half way through the review."
"A pretty atypical DIPA, but I love it! Not a hop bomb in the sens of bitterness, it's got a lot of hops, it's just balanced by the large amounts of malt. I bought a 4 pack and plan on aging 2 of them for future consumption."
"Overall I give it to Dark Horse, they made a very high ABV brew that doesn't burn on the way down. As for a representation of the style... meh. I think were leaning into the strong ale category here. Good beer, but as a DIPA maniac I'm not thrilled."
"Flavor is very good! Incredible that this beer is almost 14% ABV! Extremely smooth mouthfeel, not nearly the dry finish that most IPA's tend to have. To date...my new favorite IPA/DIPA. Booze is extremely well hidden, hoppy introductory flavor, followed by a semi-sweet full fruit taste. After taste is sweet and pleasant. Another surprise, that the IBU's are so close to 100; seems closer to 70 or so. Overall, very, very good DIPA...super impressed!"
"M/D: This is very well balanced for a 13.6% beer. It was very hard to come by around these parts, thank you josh for the bottle."
"D-this beer is huge with great flavors and tons of hops. It has a strong balance and the malts are huge as well. It is a little hot slightly showing signs of the high abv but with around 14% still pretty well hidden."
"D - Double Crooked Tree drinks exceptionally well for a 12% DIPA. I had two snifters in one sitting. However, the alcohol does creep up on you, so be warned! With that said, this is an extremely well-balanced brew that is not ridiculously bitter like some other examples of the style. Very enjoyable on tap."
"D: I stayed with one glass but could have had two. Any more and the strength would leave an indelible mark on me."
"Bottle purchased from Pinnochios in Media, PA. Had this about a year ago through trade and I am glad its available in PA now. Pours a very dark amber with big fluffy head. Smells of big hop aroma, orange, cotton candy and lots o' malt. Taste is packed with a lot of hops with a very large malt presence that keeps the hops somewhat in check. Thicker mouth feel but its not bad at all. Dangerously drinkable for the 13.6%. One 12oz brew and you'll be feeling no pain. Great night cap and a well done beer from DH."
"alcohol is present and pushes at the edges, but this beer is quite accessible at nearly 14%, which is saying something"
"D-I'm not having more than one of these. Tasty beer with a firm bitterness and nice malt backbone. I guess the only problem I have with this beer is that they call it an IIPA. It is an American Barleywine. But whatever its their beer and it tastes good."
"The bottle pours a dark red as well, but its a little lighter compared to the draft. Similiar tastes of a fruity hop bite with a very bitter finish. Quite tasty. Alc % is so well hidden. Very drinkable beer. Glad I got to try this one finally."
"I confess, I fell asleep about half way through this one, it's a doozy. It's flavorful in a good way, has characteristics of at least three styles, but is not very drinkable. I chilled with mine for over two hours. I liked how this evolved over time, but it does not remind me of a DIPA at all, just my opinion."
"Finally the beer coated the mouth and lingered in it nicely. The drinkability of this beer is lower though due to the strong alcohol, which you felt at times, though not always."
"D: Given the alcohol, and the amplitude and intensity of flavor, this was remarkable easy to consume. It held up well to a habanero cheddar cheese I was eating with crackers. Well worth a try. A good price and nice to see it in 12oz bottles... a better consumption size than bombers."
"Cheers"
"I will be tucking one or two away for a while to taste again as it ages. This is an excellent beer!"
"D: Big hop kick. Body matches and so does the alcohol."
"D-Very smooth, incredibly nice stuff. Somewhat bourbon like at times with an ever present woody dryness. Glad to have had the chance to score an offering of this on cask!"
"Overall- this ipa is one tough imperial. i love the hop attack with the mellow malt hanging peacefully with the alcohol. i will state YOU CAN DETECT THE ALCOHOL but with the 13.60 i wanna see you try to do it better. any beer where you can drink 3 of them and feel like a billion bucks i tip my hat to. if you're a hop head pick up the brew asap!"
"Drinkability is fairly fantastic. Eerily strong to feel so good, it's got an ability to cross boundaries: I could enjoy this from a Solo cup in a beach chair, or from a goblet in a throne. Neither overly hoppy nor sweetly overmalted, it's a simply delicious concoction."
"D= Nice brew. The ABV is super well hidden and this beer is really creamy. Aside from all of this I can really feel it hitting me hard with each sip. This beer is dangerous! Beware and enjoy"
"I definitely prefer this with age, although both are delicious."
"A tasty brew, has to be one of my favorites for the style. Higher price tag, but well worth it."
"Drinkability: For 13.6%, this is unbelievably easy to drink. I can feel the alcohol, but I can't really taste it. While it has some characteristics of an American Barleywine (how can it not at that abv), it is still rooted in DIPA territory."
"The drinkability of this is amazing. You can not tell that this beer is even close to 8% let alone 13.6. Awesome beer!"
"A definite best for the category of Double IPA's"
"A 12 ounce bottle sealed with green wax. Picked up a 4 pack in MI back in 2007. This is my last of the four. Uncapped and poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a murky, particle filled, dark amber color with about a finger of light tan foam. Flavors and aromas consist of bitter, resinous pine, deeply caramelized malts, nutty toffee, orange and tangerine zest, molasses, dark brown sugar. Each sip is a bit sweet at first followed by a pleasant bitterness. Not much alcohol to mention in the nose or taste, but it does warm the throat for a bit after every pull of the glass. Certainly a notch or two better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Still drinking very nicely after around 3 years in the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. Overall this is a fantastic brew for what it is, although someone looking for a DIPA hop bomb should look elsewhere."
"Again, the flavor was excellent and quite deceptive for a double IPA. So many DIPAs are malt bombs to go with their strong hop presence that they really push towards being a barleywine. Not this one. First few sips, I wondered if I was drinking the right beer. There wasn't much alcohol character for a 13.6%abv beer. Also, not that much malt sweetness character. Great hop flavor with a late lingering bitterness that makes this one of the best balanced DIPAs I've had. After a few sips, the alcohol makes itself known with a warming character down the throat -- still not much alcohol character on the tongue. Really spectacular for the strength of this beer."
"Drinkability is actually very good, to my surprise. Overall this is a solid barleywine. Yes, barleywine."
"Thank you dark horse, for I too will fight for my country."
"This was a wonderful treat - drinking like a barleywine at this point."
"..I had this on a sit down with Mike Earnheart from Dark Horse in a personal sitdown with THE GOOD BEER SHOW. This beer was amazing! Even though I had several beers that day this one kicked my ass. It fell somewhere between a Dogfish Head 90 and a Dreadnaught! Smooth creamy IPA without the overpowering typical cat piss aroma you get from other IPA's. This beer was dry hopped to improve the aroma and it worked.All I can say is WOW..THANX MIKE!"
"Pours a deep amber color with a moderate head. Aroma is of citrus and pine notes with hints of caramel. Taste is remarkably bitter to begin, but balanced by a slight caramel or molasses sweetness. Excellent mouthfeel with a medium finish. Would buy it again."
"Pours a clear mahogany or brownish red color crowned with a thin lacy cream colored head. An aroma of sweet malt and a touch of earthy hops rise out of the glass. The flavor reflects this aroma in a very well balanced brew. Sweet malt and big earthy hop flavor is smooth and accented by a touch of alcohol flavor and at 13.6% ABV, down plays it very well. The finish is a little fruity in addition to the malt and hop flavors and fades slowly into a gentle warming taste of alcohol."
"This beer pours a hazy reddish/dark orange color with a nice big head and great lacing on the glass. A strong caramel malt scent is present with the hop scent being minimal. I enjoyed this beer alot, but it reminds me more of a barleywine then an Imperial IPA, but I didn't mind that. The alcohol is definitely present, but the big flavor of this beer evens the taste out. This beer has a thick mouthfeel, but that's why I enjoy this ale...Lately I just want quality instead of quantity, so a big thick beer is what I call to. This beer is not for everyone, but definitely worth a try for those who enjoy a BIG IIPA/Barleywine style."
"If you want a low hop tasting DIPA with a kick, this is it. Easy to drink and very dangerous. I can't tell it's 13.6%, BUT I CAN FEEL IT!!"
"Drinkability: A tremendously hoppy and spicy DIPA/IIPA, yet still shows a good malt backbone. Dark Horse has just made its way into Ohio (I picked this one up in IN) and I would hesitate to grab another one of these. Of course, the high ABV precludes this from being a oft repeated drink."
"Picked up a single from Princeton Liquors. The beer appeared a hazy amber and reminded me in most ways of DFH 120 IPA. It wasn't as thick, its actually drinkable, but the beer still tasted like caramel syrup mixed with grapefruit hop juice. There are also pine and citrus rind notes from the hops, but the beer is kind of a malty mess. Worth a try if you like your beers hoppy and really strong."
"Notes: Glad to have found this in a bottle at Siciliano's last weekend. Dark Horse brews some excellent beers."
"This brew is an attention getter. Wake up (and pass out), it is time for some serious flavor. This totally reminds me of why I like to drink great quality stuff. It's like eating a great meal. In a bottle. Like doing shots. Or sipping scotch. Very nice."
"D - Almost too drinkable, this beer will probably be gone before it hits me. If I had another I'd be in trouble. A great night cap tonight as I hang out, the Double Crooked Tree can definitely age well. Tasty and drinkable, it's a helluva DIPA."
"D: Too heavy to be very drinkable."
"Drinkability is exceptional! You have to enjoy this brew responsibly @ 13.6% abv, but it is an awesome example of a unique Imperial IPA! This one is a more full bodied malt fwd IIPA, but hops show up to the game as they should to keep all players in check. Cheers to DHBC for an AWESOME IIPA. And thanks to CG for sharing!"
"I dig this one. I'm not sure it's really a DIPA -- still way too much on the malty side. Perhaps more of a barleywine as prior reviewers have suggested. But I won't make a big deal out of it -- it's a damn fine beer either way."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and I would recommend this to someone who likes a hoppy ipa with hints of citrus and pine."
"I'm always amazed at how Dark Horse crafts such great, high ABV beers that are insanely drinkable. I had a 3 snifters of freshly tapped Double Crooked Tree at the brewpub and I could have had another 3. Amazing. One of my favorite DIPAs available."
"D-Could go through several of these in a sitting and not realize this was almost a 14% brew till i was about ready to fall on my ass. Once again a very enjoyable beer just not to style in my opinion."
"Color is a deep, hazed translucent copper/amber with a fairly retentive, thin bubbly eggshell head. For the high ABV leaves a thick coat of bubbly lacing. Rich deep aroma that immediately is more reminiscent of a barleywine than a DIPA. Aroma is thick and sweet, candied malt, grapefruit, molasses, mild alcohol. Thick bodied, with mild carbonation, almost chewy, well masked alcohol presence throughout and in the finish. Hops never quite dig in and attack tastebuds like some DIPAs but grapefruit flavor and some malt sweetness linger long into the finish (along with a pleasant burn of alcohol in the throat). Body has strong, sweet malt backbone, candied sugars and caramel and the presence of hops and alcohol is subtle transition toward the finish. Like everyone else mentions, walking line between dipa and barleywine, a great beer, but not an excellent rep of either style (not that that's a bad thing by any means)."
"D- Drinks like a strong barleywine, the ABV is ridiculously present, however this brew is smooth but not complex."
"Cheers!"
"pretty good. probably would have been better, fresher. hops seemed to have faded a bit."
"I've had it on tap before and it's bliss, although out of the bottle is fine. Overall it's outstanding. Another high class brew from Marshall, Mi. I could drink a few of these without any problem."
"This one has a huge ABV which alone attracts attention. Reminds me somewhat of the 120 Minute. Have yet to be really impressed with Dark Horse."
"Great brew."
"Overall impression: A big, well balanced Imperial IPA. This is a velvet hammer. It is well balanced and highly drinkable. Strongly recommended."
"Drinkability was good. Would be a good beer to sit outside on a clear cool night and enjoy. Conversation would definitely center on the beer."
"(D)- Man, one of these will get you drunk no problem! Massive in pretty much every way, but incredible balance and not overpowering in one way or another. The only thing that really hurts the drinkability is its crazy abv, and how full it makes you feel after one. This will age forever! I only wish I knew how old or young this was to gauge how well it actually does over time. It could be fresh, a few months old, or a year. WE NEED BOTTLED DATES PPL!!"
"An interesting beer - but I would have to say it leans just a little too hard to the malts for a DIPA."
"D - At 13.6%, she packs a wallop. I don't know if this tops DFH-90 for me, but it's up there. Not as sweet as the DFH take (which I sort of like and it improves the drinkability), but doesn't lace as well or have quite as deep a color, and sits at a higher ABV. Mouthfeel not quite as smooth either."
"Drinkability is a little tricky. Sure, 13.6% abv would indicate you couldn't have more than a couple, but one to two should be no problem. It was a nice night cap to a fine evening of drinking good brews."
"This beer to me is a beer you have when you want one beer in the evening. It's nice and potent, but extremely tasty."
"Drinkability: I can imagine that a few months ago this beer would have been all about the hops and that in about 3-6 months it wall be all about the sweet caramel malt. Given the ABV this is a one a night beer, but one I could easily return given to the opportunity in the future."
"There was never any doubt that this is a big beer, but I was still pretty surprised when I saw that the ABV was so high. Pretty drinkable considering."
"I wish I had a few more bottles of this to put in the cellar."
"I was not at all expecting the sweetness of this IIPA, as sugary toffee and caramel malts hit the front of the tongue with a syrupy-smooth kiss. The 98 IBU's chime in mid-palate, with a modest bitterness that suggests pine sap and citrus, and blends well with a hit of hot, fruity booze all the way down the throat. Carbonation starts off well, but falls a bit flat near the end of the sip as the thick body actually becomes somewhat watery near the finish. The alcohol heat is mild, a nice touch given the insanely high ABV. Overall, I found Dark Horse Double Crooked Tree to be a great IIPA, on the sweeter side and DEFINITELY a sipper, but still in the ballpark of FFF's Dreadnaught."
"M/D - Medium bodied and rather sticky in the mouth. Carbonation is at a good level for a big DIPA. 13%ABV+ is very well masked. An easy drinker by DIPA standards, especially if you like your DIPA's on the sweeter side."
"D: 'Sipable', if not 'drinkable' - has a 'wow' quality that I want to love, instead kinda tolerate. Huge beer, definitely worth seeking. Will have the aged version and review, look for an update..."
"Actually drinks pretty well for a 13.6% beer, and I haven't really aged this so the alcohol hasn't had much time to mellow either. I never felt this beer was too hot, and the alcohol contributes to the flavor profile rather than detracting. Obviously, you want to drink it slowly and enjoy it as it warms and opens up to speak to you. I'll surely be having nightmares about their psycho barbie tap handles tonight."
"Carbonation is gentle and the oiliness from the hops is neutralized completely (how?). Should be a sipper but I'm having little trouble drinking it. This is skillful brewing on display and by far the best offering I've had from Dark Horse."
"Pours a hazy copper color with an almost non existent white head that disappears almost immediately. Smells of sweet caramel malts and citrus flavors and a noticeable alcohol smell though not as much as I would of expected. The taste follows the smell but is not as boozy as I expected. Incredibly sweet with a """bittersweet""" finish. The mouthfeel has medium carbination and a full body with a lovely chewiness. Another BA described this beer as """hop dessert""" which I think describes this beer perfectly. Drinkability is off the charts for such a high abv beer! I should of drank this one more slowly. Overall one of the best hop bombs I have tried to date."
"Overall, a very nice brew, a nice DIPA from Dark Horse."
"Thanks for the hook-up Alex!"
"Drinkability: Good drinkability; a solid beer to enjoy with strong food or a slow session."
"Drinkability: For thirteen+ percent, this is amazingly smooth. Fans of the style should at least give it a once-over."
"Definitely well-constructed and solid but it does drink a little heavily and slow. The massive booze quotient doesn't knock you over but it's sort of a slow, quiet burn."
"This was a pretty good beer. I would go for some of my local favorites over this, but if offered this one, I would gladly partake."
"Great double IPA that really focuses on hop flavor, minimizing the harsh bitterness associated with rediculously hopping! Dangerously drinkable for a 13.6% ABV brew!"
"After both were poured into pint glasses the double seemed to be just a shade darker than the regular crooked tree and had minimal head after a standard pour. This seemed to have a more balanced aroma than the all hop smell of the single, sweeter and more caramel. Notes of apricot and biscuit were also prevalent in the nose. Obviously the alcohol is front and center with it being over %13, but also noticed resiny hops and some grapefruit. Viscous and resiny weight on the tongue with some really funky tasting burps. This beer is a hop desert , delicious but a tad too much alcohol burn. I would share my next one with a friend. Overall, I'm glad to have tried it but won't bust my hump to track down more."
"D: Can't say for sure, since I shared this bottle, but it sure seemed drinkable. Didn't seem like 13.6% ABV."
"Drinkability? I would not *dare* to drink another back to back if I had another bottle but the 1 did me just fine. Take it slow and easy and you'll be fine too."
"Woooo.... I've been hoping to find this one somewhere. Ontap at Mackenzies in Minneapolis. Appearance is very good, looks thick and oily with a medium sized head and some lacing. Smell is good, the hops and malt get a bit drowned out by the high alcohol content. However, the hops are very floral and fruit esters. Taste brings out this even more and event a bit of sweet malt comes through here. Mouthfeel is good, thick and oily as I mentioned with some carbonation. Drinkability is obviously inhibited a bit by the alcohol, but overall a very solid beer."
"but yum!"
"Another great brew from Dark Horse Brewing. I'm loving this brewery. I can't wwait until I can travel northeast again, to get more great brews."
"I will be putting the rest of the four-pack away to age for a year as while this is good, I'm in no rush to revisit right away."
"In all, a good DIPA but I wish I could have gotten one right when they were released. Thank you AVDeuph for the hook up! Let's trade next year around release day!"
"Scary drinkability for such a big beer. Having said that it is one to enjoy slowly. I will make an effort to try this one VERY fresh next year. I also"
"One of the best DIPAs in Michigan, which in my book makes it one of the best DIPAs around."
"Thanks again for the trade Arvjunk!"
"A great beer by Dark Horse, I wish that more people could share the experience."
"Drinkability: for 13.60% alcohol and reading some of the other reviews, I was expecting it to be unbalanced and heavy alcohol taste - however this was not the case. This is a very balanced Double IPA - the alcohol simply acts to """warm you up""" As it says on the bottle - this beer is brewed in Michigans coldest month, February. I wish I had this beer in our """coldest month""" (in the 30s, maybe) January. Aside from touching on the Alcohol level like everyone else seems to - this Double IPA is the best I've tried yet - Double IPA's being my favorite style of beer. My mother who is a wine advocate loved it - so it is user friendly - she appreciated all of the flavor on the nose and in the taste - My father who drinks beer for beers sake thought it was a straight forward Double IPA. This beer really stands above the others I've had. Very drinkable, I'd love to try this beer on tap. I have a new found respect for Marshall, Michigan. Seek this beer out - If you have the means to get it - grab all you can and savor every drop."
"D - 13.6% there is no way (it is too drinkable) ok maybe there is I can feel it after one. Sooo tasty and I could drink 6 if they made it in a 6 pack."
"Drinks very easy for the AVB. I was very pleasantly surprised. I'de be able to drink these all night.... or at least until i couldnt stand anymore."
"This was not as bitter or as hoppy as I expected it to be. For as high as the ABV is I figured it would be very difficult to achieve balance, but this is incredibly balanced. Uniquely complex and solid Imperial IPA - I have to say was like nothing I have had in the past. Dark Horse is quickly emerging as one of my favorite brewers!"
"The beer is well carbonated and goes down pretty smooth for a 13.6%, but it's not anything I could drink more than one of in a sitting."
"Overall, pretty damn good for such an alcoholic brew. Kudos to Dark Horse for being able to keep the alcohol from taking over. Very solid big beer."
"D: I wouldn't put this at over 10%, no way. It's great. But you feel the booze fast, no way I could have more than one."
"Pours a cloudy nut brown with a small off-white head that quickly diminishes. Aroma is moderately sweet with caramel, grapefruit, peach,apricot and light orange. Flavor is caramel, grapefruit, light apricot and woody. Full bodied, sticky texture. Better than I expected however the balance is too much toward the malt for the style."
"At 13.6% ABV, this beer also must be taken seriously. One a night is enough, and two bottles in an hour can get you into trouble. 24oz @ 13.6% ABV is 3.264oz of pure alcohol. 8oz @ 40% ABV is 3.2oz of pure alcohol. So, drinking two bottles of Double Crooked Tree will get more alcohol into your system than downing a half pint of vodka."
"This is a solid beer - more of a strong ale or a barley wine than a DIPA. Good for what it is. If I'm gonna drink something labelled a DIPA, though, I prefer it be more like Double Trouble or Hop Slam."
"Pours a rich cedar color with a thin tan head. The nose bready caramel malts with lots of pine and citrus hops. The taste also has a big beady malt presence under a good amount of piney hops, fresh fruits and peppery alcohol. Medium to full body has nice carbonation. Drinks very well for a beer of this size."
"I would definitely recommend this to someone who enjoys exploring the Barleywine-DIPA gray area."
"D: Pretty drinkable given the alcohol content. Not something that I'm dying to have another of, however. The nose is definitely the best aspect of this one."
"This Dark Horse offering poured into snifter a very deep amber. The head was not thick, but very durable...great lacing. Smells of sweet citrus, crystal malt with nice floral/pine notes. The initial taste is in line with the aroma, but the finish has a cask/oak character. Fermented well as the 13.6% alcohol is nicely tucked away. The mouthfeel is medium with a good resin slickness and firm carbonation. Very enjoyable DIPA, but one is plenty."
"Settle back in a comfortable chair on the patio and savor this one."
"All in all, interesting and balanced, but not quite mind blowing. I will throw the rest in the cellar and revisit this down the road to see how time treats it."
"Poured slightly chilled into snifter produced a dark pretty amber with scant head though small amount of lacing lingered for quite some time. Nose was a bit sweet, hops, light floral. Taste followed suit, very smooth and well balanced, not the 'in-your-face' i was expecting with ABV being so high...quite the contrary it was a great sipping brew, fine malt taste, smooth as I said which adds for great mouthfeel and though I think it's not drinkable due to ABV, I could easily have had another and enjoyed it thoroughly!!"
"the bottle says this beer ages well and i have stashed 4 away too find out."
"D: Not terribly drinkable. The strong flavors get to you after about half a glass. It's a delicious beer, but you could easily split a 12 oz bottle and not feel cheated. An entire bottle hits hard."
"I'm wishing this had been hoppier and more bitter - it's far more balanced than other high ABV DIPAs (PtY, Kuhnhenn, Unearthly, Big Head San Diego). I can actually see this aging quite nicely - maybe I'll stash one bottle from my four-pack and see what happens."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a nice bite of carbonation."
"Dark Horse always makes me smile when I get this in. My roommate always makes me smile when he puts tape on the cats feet and makes it run around. Like while I was reviewing this beer."
"D- Well at 13% it's not really drinkable one is about all you need. It's a perfect night cappy though. And for being 13% you hardly notice the booze. Overall one of my favorites, I love this beer."
"This was a really great DIPA. What I really like about this one that sets it apart is the balance and great mouthfeel. I could see this one aging well and perhaps becoming similar to an English Barleywine in a few years. I'm sure my other three bottles won't last that long to find out though."
"Burnt orange hue, the head fizzled and retracted quickly leaving a momentary wispy centre, no ring and no lace. Lackadaisical carbonation drifted slowly from the depths of this transluscent brew and continued for quite a while. Sweet smell of barleywine, hoppy nose of citrus rind, alcohol. Big, warm mouthfeel. You can sense the higher ABV but it's very well handled considering just how high the ABV is. Caramel and toffee taste, on the sweet side without being obnoxious, bourbon notes, nice lingering finish pleases. With 98 IBU's, I expected a real bitter blitzkreig but to my surprize this is well balanced with a smooth, even texture and taste. This is very drinkable considering what's in it, like a very palateable barleywine, it's a gentle giant of a brew, try one if you get a chance."
"Served o tap at the Blind Pig in Campaign IL. Pours a clear and clean dark copper brown, really more like a well worn penny than anything else with a quarter inch of sparse head that fades away unsurprisingly but does leave some rather nice lacing. Aroma is subtler than I ever would have suspected from a DIPA, even the single crooked tree has a more powerful aroma. This being said, the beer hides a deceivingly boozy beer in a quite, though ominous smelling aroma. It's thick and sweet, more earthy than anything and not nearly as piney or fruity as other DIPAs I've come across. The flavor is something else entirely, very dry, subtle, in a certain sense, more earthy than anything, very boozy and dry and seems to change the entire time it spends on your pallate. A decent tasting beer, but honestly nothing that really makes me think wow this is something amazing. Perhaps from the bottle this tastes a bit different."
"Very rich flavor. Fairly hefty malt bill. Tons of sweetness. Had I not known beforehand, I would have thought this was a barleywine. It's definitely not overly bitter, and I'm not really detecting any of the """standard""" hoppy flavors. Pretty boozy finish. Kind of a syrupy feel. Lots of warm tingles from the alcohol, although it's not really too noticeable until the finish. Not a terribly enjoyable beer."
"This is a little different, as I didnt really think it was all that hoppy for a DIPA this strong. The alcohol is a little overwhelming however and it dominates the end of the flavor. This isn't really one of my favorites of the style but it isn't bad."
"I have no problem drinking this at over 13%. The mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired, but the taste is just a pumped up crooked tree, which I like."
"Well balanced double IPA which I'll drink one and stick number two in the cellar with my barleywines for a couple of years down the road."
"I wish this were easier found and year round as I'd keep it stocked. Different than my other DIPA favs Hopslam, Maharaja and 16 Grit, etc but just as good in a different way."
"D: This was a pretty, damn complex DIPA. Not just a hop bomb, it really gives you some malts to appreciate as well. The high ABV unfortunately kicks down the drinkability a bit. I really want to have more of these, but it just isn't possible if I want to drive home. Really worth a try."
"About time I got my hands on this one. It pours a dark amber with a thin creamy head, which is gone in a matter of minutes. Carbonation is still present, but very subtle. The nose is sweet with malt, showing hints of caramel, followed by a grapefruity hop aroma. The flavors in this brew are almost overwhelming. The malt and alcohol are noticed at first, with caramel and brandy notes, followed with a kick of piney, citrusy resinous hops. DCT is viscous, full-bodied, and absolutely waxes the palate. The finish lasts forever. It's a great beer to have as a lone sipper, but I wouldn't consume more than one in a sitting. Make sure it's the first of the night."
"Excellent brew from a brewery that knows you ought not """balance""" your DIPA, but should have it doing leg lifts to kick your ass. My calves are starting to tingle. Well done."
"I did not expect this one to be very drinkable. I am surprised- at about two-thirds of the way through, I am not feeling the booze as much as I thought I would by now. Still wouldn't want to have more than a couple of these in one sitting."
"D: As noted above, I can taste the alcohol but I don't mind. Not exactly a sipper (although at 13.6 percent abv it should be) but not the most drinkable DIPA out there."
"Best DIPA in the great Beer State of MI."
"Drinkability is not too high, based on availability, the sample I had access to, and the high ABV. I can't say that alcohol flavor is detected, but after 4 or 5 drinks, I can start to feel a little of the effects. A pretty good beer, but not a great one. Cheers!"
"A huge DIPA to say the least. There is nothing little about this brew. I almost felt like a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest! Perhaps not the best DIPA on the market, but certainly worth a try. This bottle had been in storage a while, so I'd be curious to test a fresh one!"
"This bottle has at least 6-8 months of age on it. A cloudy orange/amber pour with a finger of frothy off white head.Aroma is muted grapefruit,orange,sweet caramel malt, a nice hint of bread and pine. Flavor starts sweet then citrus,then some spice I (not sure what maybe peppercorn),honey and spruce. A nice little warming at the slightly dry bitter finish. Full body ,sticky mouthfeel,soft carbonation. Very Very Good ! A very complex IIPA."
"Notes from: 2/5/06"
"This is too drinkable, the alcohol is very well hidden. Man..."
"D-Hmm, defining drinkability for a beer such as this is difficult. I consumed this brew slowly and enjoyed every sip. I shared a sip with my roommate, who also enjoyed it. I finished this beer and wow, was I satisfied. I want another. I'll call that high drinkability."
"Notes: I can't believe I never reviewed this beer. A bruiser fresh, and a near-barleywine with a little time on it. I like this at every stage."
"Good brew with no alcohol bite."
"Pours a dark orange with a little head that fades to light film. Smell of hops dominates, with some fruity piney smell in there too, and a little malty. Little lacing as the beer is consumed. Tastes hoppy, bitter, malty, and of course the fruity pine flavors are apparent. Pretty good balance and very drinkable considering how strong the hops are in this one. Not my favorite style but definitely a worthy brew."
"BIG THANKS TO DAVID EDIFFE FOR THE EXTRA."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel keeps this one drinkabie despite the bitterness of the hops."
"D- Very drinkable to say the least. Very well rounded brew."
"Drinkability: Almost more of an aged American barleywine, this one - that is, it was expertly balanced, sweet, but with plenty of hop notes to keep things interesting. The 13.6 abv% - pretty bloody high, to be sure - is absolutely nowhere to be found, except, perhaps, in my rapidly-decreasing finger dexterity; I actually found myself finishing this off rather quickly. Kudos to Dark Horse for a killer brew, and recommended for sure."
"Not sure how much this has aged, but it does say """ages well""" on the bottle and I'd have to believe them."
"Thanks to raverjames for the nice extra."
"D- the massive ABV thats well hidden makes this very dangerous. id love to have a couple in a sitting, but that might not be such a good idea. check this out if you can!"
"Low carbonation but very smooth, a tad syrupy and sticky on the lips. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"Overall a beer of significant magnitude, and bold flavor. It is certainly a malty mofo, but the hops are defenitely in there. A unique, and impressive brew, as this one seems like it should be alot more difficult to drink than it is. Defenitely one worth having a go at. A good one from Dark Horse, and one i would love to revisit. Someday. haha. Thanks again to Gillard for a great box. Good brew."
"This could have been sold as a barleywine. As it is it's a wild, unrefined double IPA (or triple IPA). It has some enjoyable flavor traits, and the aroma is terrific, but it didn't totally work for me. Given that maybe this is just a rough batch or a bad bottle, I would probably try it again sometime. But no beer, especially no double IPA, should be this much struggle and worry. There are so many better ones in this category with much less alcohol. Sometimes bigger isn't always better. (I can't believe I'm saying it...)"
"Edit 4/29/09 I just had a fresh bottle wow hops galore. More hops in the nose and flavor there is still some sweetness in there but the bitter is more forward."
"This one is bordering on a barleywine for me, even with the minimal amount of aging on it. It's a great beer, but I would have loved to see the hops when it was fresh."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Quite drinkable."
"This beer pours a cloudy copper with a light white head and mild lacing. The smell is of sweet hops. The taste has a wonderful malt base to it, not the hop punch I was expecting but I can get some citrusy hops, I am not sure how old this was, I would love to try it fresh. For a 13.6 % beer, the fact that I can not taste alcohol is a testament to Dark Horse. My first Dark horse beer was a failure and everything since has been very promising! The mouthfeel was nice, could use a little more carbonation and for the abv this is a highly drinkable brew, although I am sure it would kick me in the teeth after a few!"
"Drinks super easy for the style & ABV; slight alcohol burn detracts. This is a damn fine DIPA! Only will get better for a least a year IMO"
"D: way too drinkable for 13.6%, could be very dangerous, but such a great beer."
"D--Very strong. Not for the faint at heart. But very nice beer. I would get this again and again--just not all at once."
"Drinkability- Not quite Pliny the Younger, but I like it more than Devil Dancer. Very drinkable and quite quenching. Actually went well with my steak and mushrooms."
"Pours a clear deep amber with a creamy off white head that leaves a little lace on the glass. Smells of piny, spicy, citrus hops with a bit of caramel malt in the background. Taste is what the smell tells you its going to be. She hits with hops, you taste a little malt then lingering hops envelop your mouth and taste buds. Alcohol is well hidden, its remarkable how easily this went down. Thick sticky mouthfeel and body, medium carbonation. Great brew. I may have aged this one a bit as it seems to not be an all out hop assault as most double ipa's seem to be. This one could easily pass for a barley wine, but that line is so blurry these days who cares. I'd love to try one of these fresh."
"Poured into a tulip. Thanks to Jw347 for this extra and a couple other BA's that have sent one! Pours a dark orange/amber with a thin off-white head that leaves some sticky lacing. This beer seems thick. Strong oily hemp/hop smell to it. Big bitter kick on first taste. Full flavor- it envelopes your mouth. Oily hop presence with a slick mouthfeel. Very solid, intense beer. Bordering on a barleywine for me. I may have aged it a bit, but with the wax seal, I thought that might be ok. Would like to try one very fresh as well."
"Drinkability is scary. 13.6%!!??!?! TRY THIS BEER!"
"Double Crooked Tree IPA is a perfect example of why the same basic recipe is sometimes better suited to brewing an IPA rather than a DIPA. In other words, there has to be more to creating a world-class DIPA than doubling everything except water. This is pretty good beer, but I'm a little disappointed that it isn't outstanding beer."
"Pours deep murky amber, cider like appearence. Fluffy big bubbles give way to clumps with some swirling lace. Orange and lemon rind, with candied sugar and strong caramel malt aromas. Sweet malts upfront give way to chewy citric and earthy hops. Tea like earthy hop flavors meld with a slight lemondrop finish. Carbonation is very subdued, giving this syrupy feel on the mouth. The hefty 13+ abv is hidden astonishingly well. This monster goes down like a pushover. Very glad I had a chance at a few of these. Gonna be pursuing this again next year. Highly recommended."
"The 13+% & thick feel made it tough for me to get through the bottle. But by god I did."
"Dark reddish with a hint of orange. Small head that lingers shortly. Smell is citrus and sweet malt. Taste is extremely well balanced and the alcohol is so well hidden I couldn't believe the 13.6%...from the taste I would have put it at half that amount. The taste is not overly bitter which lends to extreme drinkability. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but carbonation is somewhat lacking."
"And I thought the crooked tree was good - the double is awesome!"
"Very excellent brew. If I could get more of these I'd be a happy man."
"D: Not sure if I could do a whole night of these (@ 13% ABV), well maybe half a night. This is one fine brew."
"This was the first Darkhorse brew I've tried and I am impressed. Love the artwork on the label too."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"A deep orange to amber color, with a quarter inch head, cream in color. The aroma is pretty amazing, for an IPA it has a strong malt presence at the start. That is followed by an intense amount of hop fragrances of floral, citrus, and grass. Then at the end of the scent, your are hit with the boozy fragrance of alcohol. The taste is just as strong, the malt standing up to the hops. Which both blend together nicely halfway across the palate. The hops bringing citrus, grass, and earthy flavors. The feel is medium bodied at the front, becoming much more heavier at the backend. There is a slight burn from alcohol, but it disappears quickly. An outstanding Double IPA, surprisingly blends well and evenly balanced in flavor."
"Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors definitely make for easy consumption, however high alcohol limits this beer."
"Faintly cloudy dark iced tea color with a nice frothy light tan head and great lace. The aroma is thick pine hops and candy malt, very sturdy and enticing. The first mouthful is very strong piney woods hops and malty goodness. Alcohol is clearly present but not unpleasant. Acidic woodsy rhubarb with beautiful body, solid but drinkable for the style. This is a beauty with an occasional hint of chocolate. My friend says it smelled like an old barbershop but that's a good thing. Just a lovely dipa, highly recommended."
"After I got the cap off I noticed a sludgy lacing on the inside of the bottle and noticed some sediment at the bottom. Usual for the style, just sayin'. Anyways this DIPA pours an amber color with virtually no head to it. Very thick with little carbonation. A nice pleasant aroma of caramel and biscuit malts mixed with a faint scent of hops greets me as I pour. Tastes much sweeter than I expected! More like a barleywine too me, which isn't bad at all. I'm thinking that the person who sent me this may have had it for a while because the taste I get is dominate by malts; the hops have completely disappeared. Very thick with a consistency close to maple syrup, this is most certainly a sipping beer."
"Not bad, but not all that great either. This was certainly worth a try, but it really is too strong in alcohol, for me, to be an IPA. I do like that it is not overly heavy though, but it is still not something I want to drink more than a few ounces of. Still this is not bad in small doses."
"Pours a clear copper color with a pinky of creamy off-white head that has a bit of retention and leaves spotty lacing. Smells big of citrus; pineapple, orange, tangerine, and grapefruit with good caramel and bread notes as well as earthen hops and pine with a slight alcohol presence. Taste starts off with flavors of caramel sweetness and biscuits with a hint of raisins. Lots of hop flavors follow with a touch of pine and spicy hops before the finale of grapefruit and pineapple and a warming alcohol finish. Medium full in body with low carbonation. Well balanced with bready sweetness and a good variety of hop flavors. An excellent DIPA, but at 13.6% ABV, it's not a session brew, nor is it something I would drink frequently, better to save for special occasions."
"This is pretty tasty, although flawed. Head was very disappointing which really hurt the nose, as I said before. Alcohol is awfully aggressive, as well. Pretty intense brew and definitely worthy of a try for any hop lover, but I would choose other DIPAs first."
"This is good, but one is my limit, especially at this abv. It was all I could do to finish it for that reason alone. Perhaps I shouldnt have tried to drink it at the end of a 14 hour work day since i was already tired, this just knocked me out. I would drink it again if it was available for sure, but wondering if the regular crooked tree would have been strong and bold enough, but that one i have never tried."
"I expected something nearly feral with its IBUs and ABV, but this is well-heeled and almost domesticated."
"Ovr: I really love this beer becuase it tries to be a great beer, and that's it. Too often DIPA's just try to be huge unbalanced hop messes that don't work for me. This beer, the hop character is large, but in perfect harmony with the alcohol and malt. Only complaint is that it was a bit light on the mouthfeel for my tastes."
"Notes: Definitely among the better malt-bomb DIPAs that I've had. I'm surprised i enjoyed it as much as i did"
"Pours a clear dark almost tea colored amber color with a full finger off white head that resists fading. Spotty lacing patterns in it's wake. The smell was leathery and """horse blanket""" from the residue on the cap. Sweet grainy malt molasses and caramel. Lightly carbonated, with a really smooth tang of booze. Yes, that's booze, but it's smooooth. Liking it!. Full flavored, the taste is malty and sweet with an Imperial Red caramel thing going on. Way too easy to drink at 13.6% ABV!! Had my eye on this one for some time....thanks again Dave!"
"d: Thanks to TheBlackMallard for the chance to try this beast. This isn't something I would reach for often, but if I had access it would make a great treat every now and then."
"This is a high quality, highly alcoholic brew from Dark Horse. They did a great job balancing out all the huge flavor. I've made a point to pick a few 4-packs up the last couple years. It's a good beer to sit back and try to enjoy slowly."
"Amazing! makes me proud to live 20mins or so from Marshall :D"
"D - One is about it for a session."
"This is definitely an evolved DIPA. I'm impressed with the deviation from the norm in typical releases of this style. It's a big beer. Definitely hoppy and bitter. But, it's also more balanced than you might expect and presents itself as more tame than it really is. Given its strength and the slight buzz I'm feeling, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing. But, it's an excellent beer nonetheless. A little more carbonation is about the only thing that would improve this beer. For what it is, it's spot on otherwise. Thanks again, Christian. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable, considerably very drinkable Double IPA from Dark Horse."
"A nice take on the big-ass 2IPA."
"A very nice beer, I was glad to have a chance to try it. Thanks to Shivtim for the chance. Pours amber with an okay head and some noticeable floaties. The aroma is lightt but very citrusy and pleasant. Smells relatively fresh, so the floaties don't worry me. The taste is very nice. A bit sweet up front followed by nice flavors of cream, cherries, vanilla, and citrus. Probably the creamiest double ipa I've had and quite pleasantly fruity as well. The beer drys out a bi toward the finish, which is nice. Very creamy and smooth in the mouth with some lingering hop bitterness. A great pleasure to drink and I'm astonished at the listed abv- I wasn't aware of this aat the time I drank it, and in no way did it seem hot or anywhere near that abv. A fine beer."
"A bit of an underrated beer, IMHO."
"drinkability is decent. this is a huge brew, with a notable amount of alcohol, at 13.6% APV, but with that being said, the boose is masked wonderfully. nicely executed brew from Dark Horse. cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful rusty yellow color with an average head, and average lacing and slightly under carbonated. Smells strong citrusy hops with some malts coming through. First taste is extremely hoppy and bitter. Finishes with a lovely bitter after taste The 13.6% ABV is very well hidden. This is one good DIPA."
"Big ups goes out to Unknownoffender for hooking me up this time."
"Thanks to Kipling for this one. It pours a dark amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice fluffy lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine resin, and flower patch. The taste is hoppy, but balanced. Grapefruit, pine, and flower are all over the place, back by a firm malt presents. There is a moderate alcoholic hotness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a fine IIPA. I will certainly drink this again."
"Mouth watering...smooth and serene. Very well balanced dance between the hops and malt, with the malt taking the lead. Masks the alcohol very well, but slight boozy-ness becomes more prevalent with time/temperature. Nice smooth, very light, slightly syrupy mouth feel with just enough bite to remind you how massively hopped this thing of beauty is, despite its own balance. Fruity/malty, very reminiscent of a barley wine. Sticky finish, like walking across the floor of a movie theater in the dark in wooden clogs. Ha ha, made ya think."
"Pours a nice dark amber color with little to no head from a slightly aggressive pour into my Sierra Nevada Pint glass. It smells really nice and sweet and also has a subtle, citrusy hop aroma. Kind of surprising that the malt stands out more than the hops on this one. The taste is excellent. Its a great balance of that sweet caramel malty taste with a pungent citrus hoppiness that makes it lean almost closer to a barleywine in my opinion. The mouthfeel is really nice and creamy on this one and man the 13.6% alcohol is hardly smelled or tasted at all meaning this one could really sneak up on you. A great beer."
"D- A good taste and great mouthfeel- I wish this beer had more in terms of hops. The balance was tipping towards the malt flavors for me, which started to lead down the path to barleywine, and while delicious, I just don't feel like a barleywine right now. But regardless I would recomend this beer, and if it wasn't so damn hard to get and expensive, I might even like to try it again."
"D: A very slow sipper. The 13.60% is only a surprise because it's still a DIPA. The alcohol is obviously very present but it just doesn't seem 'hot' to me. I could easily see aging potential. A very different DIPA."
"This DIPA is big and bold and unfortunatley a little boozier than I normally like but after finding out that this thing is nearly 13%, I had to do a double take. This definitley tastes more like it's in the 8-10% range and I hae to give mad props to Dark Horse for keeping an ABV like that so well hidden. This isn't for the faint of heart but more for those that like a little extreme attitude in their beer. Nice."
"Twelve ounce bottle is topped in green wax. Pours a mostly clear copper body with a small beige head. Excellent retention and generous chain lacing on the glass. Aroma is inviting. Pink grapefruit, toffee, caramel, and some earthy hops here. Mouthfeel reveals a smooth medium body with medium carbonation and a hint of syrupiness. Taste opens with a citrusy hop bitterness that suggests pink grapefruit and Valencia oranges. Solid caramel malt backbone. Warming alcohol makes itself known. Quite engaging but venturing near barleywine territory."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a surprisingly small head for the force of the pour. Smells of floral hops and melted caramel candies. The first sip is heavy on the Werthers, backed by pineapple, lemon zest, and pepper. Candies keep showing up in the flavor - something about the hoppy finish, spice aside, is reminding me of an orange dumdum or a creamsicle. I suppose I'm subconciously saying this is pretty damn sweet. Fume-y ethyl acetate is prevalent but not unwelcome, kind reminds me of Dogfish's heavy duty entries in the style. Starts to creep over that thin, nigh invisible line toward barleywine. The mouthfeel is quite thick and remarkably creamy. Noticed a little seltzer-like bubbling up front, but the lingering feel is all syrup and resin, leaving one's tongue with the hot booziness for quite a while. Overall, this isn't hitting my sweet spots, though its certainly not inherently flawed - there's actually alot to recommend this if you're into the sweeter, maltier end of the spectrum. Thanks to autumnaldave for the chance to try this one."
"Received in a trade from saucya, thanks dude! Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Almost an amber color with hints of yellow and zero head (too careful of a pour?). Aroma is a balanced mixture of piny hops and caramel malts. And I'm not saying the malts remind me of caramel a little, they smell EXACTLY like caramel. Pretty interesting. Taste starts of with a piny hop bitterness and then transitions right into caramel, much like the aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but nice and smooth. Drinkability is high, I could definitely put away a lot of these. I've recently delved into the world of DIPAs, and this particular one is unique when compared to the others I've had. Overall I like this beer, but ultimately I wanted something more hoppy."
"Drinkability- Had I not known this thing was 13.6% I would have never guessed it a hair over 8-9%. It's super balanced and ridiculously tasty. I really enjoyed the normal Crooked Tree IPA but this one is doubly better (get it! Lame...). Highly recommended brew that needs to be sought out in February when it's released!"
"Overall, a fucking awesome beer for the value!!"
"The bottom line: Dark Horse has put together a very serviceable DIPA with Double Crooked. The alcohol is absolutely hidden as far as i'm concerned, and I was shocked to find out that this is a 13% beer. The flavour profile is not as big as the alcohol might make you think though, and this is not a particularly amazing beer for its style, merely good."
"good looking bottle with a green wax seal. the inner neck of the bottle had a thick slurry all the way to the top both before and after pouring. color was deep amber/chestnut and quite cloudy. minimal, quickly dissipating off-white head, thin lacing. kind of dull overall in appearance. nose was rum-soaked dried fruits, toffee, caramel, and a bit of menthol/pine. well-baked cookies as well in the background. sweet dark fruity malts upfront with a smooth and subtler than expected bitterness. definitely on the malty side for a dipa. alcohol again prominent in the taste, which is a negative for me. huge body, very viscous, and very little carbonation to balance this monster. definitely a sipper and had me dragging the next day. overall this was disappointing with the alcohol overpowering this beer."
"Overall: Great beer. The sweetness on this one is unique, and hopheads will not be disappointed."
"Releases only athin head, then a quick, thin ring of foam to a top of nothingness. But the color is just stellar, dark amber, ruby mix. Looks a little syrupy. The aroma is a dark orange, and heavily toasted malt. A little pine a well. Caramel and crystal malts give this bitter IPA a strong caramel flavor with a mix of hoppy pepper. The Bitterness impart almost a chocolate like citrus bitternes. Very intersting. The abv warms and blends well the well balanced bitterness and malty goodness. Definetly a nightcap sipper."
"The mouthfeel is pretty full with very little carbonation. I doubt if I would drink a lot of this beer in a single sitting. To me it's a good sipping beer, but not exciting or interesting enough to make me want to keep getting more and more."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin, though smooth. This is one good DIPA, tasty and smooth enough to almost quaff. I'd like more hops in the taste, but it's diverse enough to more than make up for it. Very delicious."
"Tad sweet, tad hoppy - why, it balances out quite nicely!"
"For all real purposes this shouldn't be a highly drinkable beer, but I'm sipping it like crazy. As far as huge DIPAs go, this one manages to be full of huge resiny hops without a phenolic overtone. Malt dose is plenty to keep the hops from skying with bitterness. This is one surprisingly drinkable 13.6%abv DIPA."
"Pours and dark copper color with a thin lace of head. Smell is has sweet malty and hoppy aromas. Taste is unbelievable. It's exploding with hoppy flavor, but keeps you interested in it's flavor. Mouthfeel can't get any better. The bitterness, smoothness, and carbonation are perfect balanced. This is by far the best Double IPA I've had and $2.79 for 13.6% ABV can't be beat for a beer with such flavor and robustness."
"D-1 or 2 would probably be great. 4 to 6 may put you out for a nap with 13.6% abv."
"I like this one, but it's one of those """a little goes a long way""" brews. I have only had a couple from this brewery, but it is quickly becoming a favorite."
"Pours a hazy dark orange color with a lasting whitish head and nice lacing. Smell is a unique musty and fruity smelling hop character. Taste is moderately bittered and similar musty fruit flavors with perhaps some mango. Not a very clean flavored IPA in my opinion with the citrusy character I get in lots of IPAs, but still nice. Body seems full but the low carbonation still makes it seem almost watery at the same time. Unique, and drinkable. Solid IPA."
"Shockingly easy to drink for as big of beer as it is. Overall pretty outstanding."
"This IIPA is like a punch to the mouth. Yet, still enjoyable. Drink it slow and enjoy."
"Notes: A solid beer. Pretty unique stuff, definitely stands out from the pack. Normally I'd never age an IPA, but I may just try it with this one."
"Drinkability - Good, but a slow sipper. Reminded me more of a barley wine. Surprised the ABV was hidden so well. Highly Recommended!"
"A dark amber with almost brown edges. Carbonation rises slowly through the thick, potent brew. An off-white head fading to a ring through consumption. Spots of lacing down the glass. I'm in for it. Smell just has to be malty, I mean damn it's a big brew. Sweet fruity malts and caramel with sappy, piney hop presence. Taste is explosive but gentle somehow. The little bit of heat from the smell isn't quite as big in taste. At first the same malts show up that the smell boasted. Caramel and sugar, some fruit. Hops and bitterness are soon to come through. Yep, this is a beast. Mouthfeel is bitter but also very full and creamy. Great sensation on the tongue. I think this will stay with me for a while. Good drinkability considering how huge this is. I really enjoyed this and am glad I have another bottle for later (no, not tonight damnit)."
"D- For such a high abv beer it is very easy to sip on. In my opinion it just suffers from being a bit one demensional. While it is extreme in the amount and intensity of the taste, nothing in the flavor profile is very diverse. A good brew that I will probably try again at some point."
"This is an intense beer there is a lot of flavor smashed into this wax coated bottle. I like it a lot, the alcohol brings the drink ability down a little bit, this cold only be a session beer if you were Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas"
"D: Surprisingly enjoyable for such a big IIPA. The sweet caramel malt works wonders in keeping the alcohol under control. This is a palate destroyer!"
"Nice beer, one is usually enough during the week like tonight."
"One of the most drinkable and pleasant higher alcohol (12% abv+) Double IPAs that I have tasted ever. I'm loving this hop fix."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle from Hoppymeal (thanks again) into a new belgium snifter. Poured a murky amber color with slight orange hue. A nice finger sized white head foamed up. The smell was a haunting pine, earth, citrus sweet scent with a little alcohol in the background. Taste was night a day from the smell. It was heavy on the pine bitterness but the hoppy flavor was lost among the sweet malt backbone and the bitterness of the hops. The alcohol level being so high was very well hidden though. The mouth feel was medium body with a nice stickness and low carbonation level. This beer is not really what comes to mind to me as a DIPA. It more like a barleywine that has been hopped up. The balance isnt there, but...I really do believe this beer should age fantastic and wish I didnt open up this bottle yet and think in maybe 2-3 years at cellar temps it will be better balanced."
"Original Dark Horse Crooked Tree left me wanting a stronger american ipa. I finally got to try this double on draught at the MI Winter Brew Festival 2008. now THAT's what I'm talking about. The regular Crooked Tree should be made this way. Excellent!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, almost syrupy thick with a rather dangerously high drinkability considering the high alcohol content. I was a little unsure how much I would like this one, but it's pretty damn good. It's for sure a one drink a night kind of beer, but it's definitely something I would look for again."
"Thank you to Brouche for sending me this beer in the NoBS BIF Ultra. Served slightly chilled, in a pint glass, from a twelve ounce brown bottle dipped in green wax. Poured a beautiful, cloudy amber orange with quite a bit of sediment in it. A good two fingers of thick, creamy, off-white head sprung up from the glass. Decent head retention with some sticky lace left behind in the glass. Big thick aroma smelled like a glass full of hops. Nice floral hop aroma mixed up with some orange peel, lemon zest, and a huge malt aroma. The flavor is bitter, juicy hops, a thick yet balancing malt flavor, tons of citrus infused with just a subtle touch of pine. Most of the 13.6 percent alcohol content is buried beneath the complex flavors of this big IPA, but has a bit of a warming effect in the finish. Just enough carbonation to tickle the tongue and throat. Big full bodied, oily resiny mouthfeel. Very thick and coats the palate. Drinkability is right up there as well but I prefer to nurse this one. This is one big ass crooked tree. Great job Dark Horse, Keep up the good work, and look out Devil Dancer!"
"Creates a three inch tan head full of rich creamy bubbles. Body is a murky amber color with quite a bit of noticeable sedamet. Leaves a bit of lace as the head fades. Nose is a very rich mix of nice hops and even a hint of malty sweetness laced with big spicey alchol. Enters the mouth richly smooth and creamy with buzzing hops and spicey zest. Hops are slightly oily and show ripe citrus hints. Alchol is nicely warming to the belly but not loud on the palate. This beer is so amazingly drinkable for how big it is. Complexity and uniqueness are strong points of this brew. I as a stout lover have found another big double IPA I can really enjoy."
"Pours a cloudy caramel orange with a ton of visable sediment (I wish I pulled up at the end to prevent this) with a big tangy head that dies pretty quick. Smells piney, big citrus rind and a malty sweetness. Taste is very big on piney rind hops with a malty backbone. Medium in the mouth with a slight ting on the finish. Obscene how drinkable it is, if I were to guess I would say half the ABV. An awesome brew and a must try."
"Overall: This one is aged a bit; I would love to try it fresh. If you ask me this one is more Barleywine than DIPA and a good one at that. It is a big; no scratch that huge beer both in nose and taste. I really liked this one and will be in search of a case. Some to drink, some to trade, and some to age.... Hell Yeah!"
"A little warm, but no distinct alcohol flavor. Syrupy texture. Sweet finish. This should age really well. Glad to have an extra to try it out."
"D: Good, but not $4 per 12 oz bottle good. Besides looking very unappealing, this one lacks any real character. There are much better DIPA's out there."
" Overall I will pass; this was not even worth a novelty look as far as I am concerned. It was just an overdone double that had too much emphasis put on blowing away taste buds and jacking up the ABV. Maybe I got a bad bottle, I don't know, but this was not really as enjoyable as I would have liked. Too big for its own good would be the best way to describe it. I tried it, and I have had worse, but I have had much, much better. Overall I will pass and wait for the next round. I guess it might be good to try, hopefully just a flat bottle, but defiantly unimpressed and completely under whelmed. Now the bottle, top notch, awesome graphics and a wax seal, both very nice touchs, however I just wish what was inside could have lived up to how good it looked outside."
"D- There is not a lot of depth to the hops but they are big and wonderful with a nice strong support but the sweet malt and the soft alcohol notes. This beer is very smooth to drink and could turn into a dangerous session beer."
"I still have 3 more I'll open in months or years to come."
"Pours a dark murky amber with a thin half finger head that quickly dies down to few tiny bubbles. Tiny spotty stickiness here and there. Smell is huge citrus and alcohol with a good caramel malt backbone. Good combination of hop and malt fighting for the noses attention. Taste is quite surprising...very dirty hop mixed with some pine. Is it me, or is there no alcohol on the tongue The huge malt flavor comes through as well to balance this beast out perfectly, yes...perfectly. Mouthfeel is huge, thick, and a bit syrupy...wow is there a lot there. Bubbles are trying to exist but it's pretty difficult for them to do so. I can't imagine how good the drinkability will be with age, none the less, I can't wait to find out after I age one of these for a while. If you enjoy complex beers, get this one for sure. There really isn't anything like it out there."
"Easy to drink but the 13% makes it hard to drink too many."
"Pours a very cloudy amber/orange color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, which dissappears quickly, not much sticky lacing to follow. The nose is big on malts, hops, nice touch of grapefruit/pine, lots of sweet caramel. The taste is hoppy/malty and sweet, good piney/grapefruit taste. Slight bitter/dry on the finish. The alcohol is hidden very well for a 13% ABV plus brew. Very drinkable, an awesome DIPA, highly recommended."
"D- I think it is very good. I wasn't expecting to much just being as high in alcohol as it is. Very tasty and I wouldn't mind drinking more of this at all."
"This beer has to be the epitome of unfiltered beer. After I poured the dark gold brew into my pint glass from the bottle it looked like a Christmas snow globe that you shake up. Or perhaps an aquarium that really needs cleaning. The smell was pine-like, hoppy, and a possessed a hint of fruit. The taste was surprisingly smooth. I expected a thick syrupy beer but it was easy to drink. Tasted great. Tasted like it smelled. For being 13.6% Alcohol it was remarkable. I love this beer."
"Bottle via xav33- thanks! Cracked this baby on my birthday. Seemed like a suitable bday beer. Pours out a dark tangerine, cloudy and not much head. Aroma is very nice- a real blast of thick hops and malt. Taste- heavy citrus and syrupy malts. Booze is not all that noticable for a beer of this potency. Very flavourable- not astringent from the hops, nor too cloying from the shit load of malt in ths thing. Drinkability is high which is probably a very dangerous thing. This would be deadly in a bomber! Overall, very enjoyable beer and very happy to get a change to try it."
"D - The alcohol is slightly noticeable but very well hidden for near 14%. A big tasty DIPA."
"Goes down pretty easy and has a nice firm body. Certainly worth tracking down."
"I thought this was much easier to drink than anticipated. The alcohol level is deceptive so be careful. Very satisfying overall..."
"Overall, a nice DIPA. It's not at all balanced and a little too hot, but still enjoyable."
"Wish I had another."
"On draft at brewery. Bartender poured about 10 beers worth down the drain due to foam! Served in a 10oz tulip due to Michigan laws(?). Pours a great looking dark amber with monster head. Aroma is citrus, pine and fruits, very appealing. Taste is exceptional with wonderful citrus and fruit tastes with very little of the harshness you get from the regular Crooked Tree. Very smooth tasting. Not too sweet, just right. As I drank this fresh I told my friend it was a perfect beer. Wow, is it a lot better fresh on draft than in the bottle."
"Another beer from the Milwaukee haul. I thought this was a somewhat ugly looking but good tasting DIPA. It's a little stronger in alcohol than I like, but it is hidden well. I'd like to try this on tap somewhere."
"Drinkability is above average because it's quite interesting. It's fun to see how it morphs into several different beers as it warms up. This would be a good one to ponder the meaning of life over with a cigar after dinner. If you're in the market for a 2xIPA, consider this as a barleywine to avoid disappointment. Cheers!"
"Thanks, ClockworkOrange, for the unusual treat and ThomasHardy, for the chance to revisit"
"I do appreciate that brandonman63 gave me the opportunity to try this..."
"Overall, this is an imbalanced example of a DIPA with too forward a hop presence and not enough malt to back up its immaturity. I'll cellar a few bottles and see if things mellow out with another two years. Until then, stick to other DIPAs."
"A very big DIPA, maybe a triple IPA, whatever that is. Excellent, but one and done or I'm not making it into work tomorrow. I would like to taste this blind against Founder's Devil Dancer."
"Overall, wow, what a beast of a beer! Nothing but great conifer like flavors, the whole frickin family. A bit harsh and definitely a palate puncher. My mouff ith gnow gnummmb."
" D - The drinkability is very hard to knock. Way too easy to drink at the potency level attained. Great balance even though it is a powerhouse. It is a sipper for sure - it will warm you and take over if you aren't careful. I was impressed by the smoothness of the barleywiney malts, but it definitely is hopped to the point to deserve the Imperial Ipa label with all the flavor and aroma it brings to the table."
"Great DIPA...one of the best."
"from zrrbrrt"
"D) I'm surprised the alcohol is so high in this as it's well hidden. I have had many 9%ers that were more alcohol forward than this."
"Cheers!"
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not very filling, this is one of those beers that blurs the fine line between Double IPA & Barley Wine. I could drink this for a while, but it won’t take long for the ABV to catch up with you. Overall, it is a very good beer."
"I love this brewery. Ive not had anything remotely resembling a average beer from them."
"987"
"Medium body, with lower carbonation. Bitterness is not overwhelming as the nose led me to believe. Pretty good."
"Taste is rich and hoppy. Mouthfeel is velvety, almost up to the decadent level. Caramelly malt, long residual herbal bitterness from the huge load of hops present. Not much to hint at the ABV either, until you're halfway through the glass already. Be careful with this one. A bold and powerful DIPA."
"drinkability is surprisingly good. quite smooth and balanced. it's a bit warm, but definitely doesn't seem like nearly 14%."
"Fairly flat pour, minus some thickly outlined bubbles on the outskirts. Completely bald in the middle though (like a receeding foam hairline!) A very dark colour for the style; sludgy brown with some ruby in the shine. Some degree of clarity, but blurred. Leaves thick legs, and in a coating of spots throughout. A lovely pleasing aroma full of soaked pine notes. The depth increases longer you smell it. A harmonious blend of alcohol, esters, and hop resin. A mouthful of warming sensation, strong flavour profile carrying profiles of ginger bread-like malt (all sticky and nice), hop resins, raisons, plums, other lightly fruity notes (as in a brandy). Graceful finish, the hops really shine through with a long lasting sensation. There is no mistaking the alcohol, but it is considerably well hidden for its strength. This is something slightly different than other DIPA's; I found it fantastic. Thanks Russ!"
"Overall, an absolutely gigantic beer, and I'm very interested to see how it will age. Recommended."
"Dark and murky looking amber. Thin crop of white foam. Decent lace. Aroma is very piney and fruity. Like passion fruits soaked in vodka....but good vodka. Sweet and rich malts are evident on the nose as well. The taste is very rich. Nice luxurious malt base. Thick and rich. The hops come into the equation soon after. Some resiny and oily characteristics. And then comes the alcohol. Like a spiked punch deal. But in a good way. Gotta give this beer some props. 13.6% a/v. 98 IBUs. And it's quite drinkable. This is not hard to drink. It's tasty and rich and mellow. The bitterness is not overdone. This is one of those DIPAs bordering on Barleywine because of the richness of malts, but who the fuck cares. It's a very nice creation. And quite enjoyable...and reasonable at $3 a bottle."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The body is very smooth. The carbonation is perfect. The flavors linger a long time. This was a pleasure from start to finish. I wish I had another."
"Mouthfeel is big and viscous, with a mellow smoothed out carbonation. It packs a punch but still ends up going down pretty smooth. A huge brew that I'm happy to have tried. I hope to grab another 4 pack of this next time I see it. I dunno if I could drink more than one in a sitting but it's sure a tasty treat every now and again. Yet another tasty brew from Dark Horse."
"bought a bottle of this after visiting the brewery last month and thought it was time to try it. Pours brown with some grainy sediment. huge lacing, bubbles clinging to everything. Looks crazy-good. Odor is a lot of hop oils...sweet and lupulin filled. Smooth sweet and malty taste. Bitter, but not up front. Assertive on the finish instead with a lot of lingering bitterness. A fine sipping syrup of a beer but not one thats so hardcore you'd have to wait 3 months to want another one. Another very well made beer from Dark Horse...but hey, they dont make anything that's even close to sub-par."
"Mouthfeel was full bodied with an oily smoothness. Mild carbonation in the mouth. There is not mistaking--this is a big beer."
"poured a cloudy orangish amber, with a light khaki color head that left some good lacing. aroma, pineapple, light brown sugar , alcohol, hops which were not as strong as I thought they would have been. flavor it was hard to decide if the malts or the hops came out first but I did like the combo. caramel, got some orange , was looking for the pineapple but could not taste any, did get brown sugar and grapefruit. what a way to start off a Friday evening but with a great local beer"
"Overall: Good brew but i'm willing to bet that, when fresh, this beer is much better. Next time, i'll drink fresh."
"Probably the most obvious difference between the two is the appearance. While the cooked tree looks completely unfiltered (a very musty/cloudly tan body), the double has a dark-brown, slightly clearer body. The head on the double was light and quickly vanished. The crooked tree had a lasting, fluffy white head of foam with lots of lacing. The aroma's differed greatly as well. Citrus (yet earthy) hops were the dominating aroma in the crooked tree, with sweet malts were drowning out the hops in the double. This also carried over in the flavor. It's hard to believe these have the same hop profile. The crooked tree has a grapefruit hop bite, with a slightly sweet finish. The double has a rich malty sweetness complimented with a rough, bitter, earthy hop punch. I do think the double has crossed over to a very complex barelywine -- certainly with age this is what it will become. The mouthfeel in the double is full-bodied, chewy and dry. The crooked tree is lighter, smoother and finishes with less aggressiveness. Overall, I enjoy both. I will say, however, that the crooked tree is definitely more of an IPA (a damn good one), whereas, the double...is just too malty for the category, in my opinion. The double is very good, but the alcohol is felt and the drinkability is pretty low. Its more of an after dinner treat. Very good stuff."
"Finally, a beer I had at Landmark 1850 that tastes fresh/unfettered (although I'm still not sure as it was intended)!"
"FIRST TRIAL: Bottle for Murrays Wine and Spirits. This is a very interesting DIPA which I say because it doesnt have a big hoppy bitter kick at the end. The flavor is a peachy/fruity/amarillo hop, but theres really not that big bitter finish that Ive come to expect from a lot of DIPAs. The aroma is very similar to the flavor (nice and fruity) and the color is a nice semi-cloudy bronze. The mouthfeel is great, very smooth with lots of warmth, but the 13.6% is hidding remarkably well. Overall, I would recommend this to any hop-fan as an interesting brew despite the lack of the bitter kick."
"Overall, a superb beer in a class of its own! Well done!"
"this is a very very good DIPA, give it a shot"
"dark brown sludge with bits of pink and purple as the light comes through. murky, with virtually no head to speak of. smells of pine forest, moss, rubbing alcohol -- a sinus clearer, to be sure. tastes of pine needles, bitter green leaves, burnt bread crusts, liquor. this is the backwoods cousin of your typical fruity citric-hopped IPA. mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, stagnant. the swallow makes you wince. this is natural medicine, or poison, or devious sleeping potion. rugged, hot in the throat, very nice."
"Taste starts out with, you guessed it, raw hops! Numbing, resinous, and somewhat toasted. Sweet, barleywine-ish malt of caramel, sugar, and fruits soon follows. Big wave of hop bitterness, pine, and ganja into the finish. Warming, but not overpoweringly alcoholic. Medium-full body with a syrupy, lightly carbonated feel. Finish is a bit drier. A wonderful sipping beer for hop lovers. Less astringent and less boozy than Devil Dancer (another great DIPA of this strength), which makes it quite drinkable. Very good beer!"
"D- It took me quite awhile to polish this off. I am really curious as to how this will taste with some time on it. This really seems like it could do some good in the cellar- even as good as it is now. This is not a one dimensional IPA. Not disappointing by any means- worth hunting down."
"Damn I forgot which Michigan BA to thank for this bottle so thank you all. I'm a sucker for the wax dipped bottles and this green wax looked very cool to go with the cool label. No sound when I popped the cap but it was very alive and smelled like a hop factory mixed with a caramel factory. Wow what a first taste. Intense hop flavors but great maltiness to balance it out. Long complex finish of dry hops, mead and salty crackers. This reminds me of a bigger and better Stone 10th. This one goes back on the want list."
"D: I scored this one down here simply because it's become very sweet, and as has been mentioned several times has a very high ABV. I could take one of these every so often, it would make a nice after-dinner beer accompanying a tart dessert."
"Originally reviewed on May 15, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Deep henna pour, as the sailing clouds of a passing Noreaster on a warming May evening. Wisps of tannin drenched head rim the top and sheet the glass. A light haze and bottom fringe of gold. Enticing strong aroma of stewing fruits amongst the tendrils of glowing resin embers and toasted vegetal ends, amongst the leaves of Kaffir, lie a sultry basket of blood oranges, meyer lemons and fresh ruby red. The eyes close and a stream of pure body warm milk glides down the throat. Theres supple alcohols and dancing perfumes. What an aroma. The flavor is more astringent and surprisingly more thin bodied than the aroma lets on. A bit of a tease, the thinner slightly watered malt carries a current of tantalizing pine and citrus, backed with the rise of a fresh Cat Briar shoots on a drenched east coast morn. Finish with a light buttery coating and a heavy vegetal smack and you got a somewhat lesser form of an IIPA. The hops do make it a little bit to that warm bready yeast spice, but not quite enough. The grassy plant flavors are just a little too heavy on the back end to make this an all around winner."
"D - Good. Very good. It goes does extremely easily. I just wish the yeast blended better. It is not the sort of thing to drink every day, but it is definitely good to have once. I might try it again if I ever find myself up Michigan way. Definitely a blessing to hopheads out there."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy, barleywine-esque, with a sugary, hoppy mix. This one still seems hot, even after letting it mellow for over a year."
"As you can tell I thoroughly enjoy everything about this beer (well except opening it). They could call this thing a saison for all I care, it's a great tasting beer that I would love to have many on hand. Be very interesting to cellar a couple of these and try one ever 6 months or so. I bet in a year or two this beer would be something else."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, with a few random bubbles over the cloudy coppery amber brew. Lacing was minimal, at best. Aroma consisted of musty grains and ample alcohol. Taste also exhibited the same dull malt flavor, with moderate hops character and alcohol warmth on the swallow. Mouthfeel is okay, as is drinkability, but just not exciting enough to meet the Double IPA style and/or make me ravished enough to search it out again. A rare miss for me from these guys."
"Slick, syrupy mouthfeel. Mild carbonation. I bet this one is better when fresh. Aftertaste only lasts about 30 seconds. Not bad at all, but I should have drank this sooner, I think."
"Well the hops come out in the mouth more but it is still dominated by the huge toffee malt. A nice alcohol burn is in the chest after the first sip. The hop that is there is juicy, and palate coating resiny. Leaves a mouthwatering bitter finish of about 45 seconds. There are even hints of apple, and alcohol in the flavor as well. Nice balance and complexity but I do think it's been aged slightly too long. I will definitely have to locate one of these to try at an earlier stage of it's life."
"Pours a burnt orange color and quite murky, still showing a smallish cream head. Sweet citrusy hops and big malty sweetness in the aroma. Also a faint smell of alcohol which comes thru stronger in the taste, letting you know its big. Taste follows aroma with a little spiciness in the fairly dry finish. This one is starting to wane a little in that the mouthfeel is going slightly flat with low carbonation, but I still enjoy it as much today as I did early in the summer when it was fresh, in fact I like the low amt of carbonation and some of the alcohol in the taste, while still present, has mellowed just a bit. A great dipa with a big malt backbone, can't wait for next years."
"This was a disappointment on a number of levels."
"The flavor is best described as a massively hopped barleywine. Pretty nice but I couldn't drink too many (not just the alcohol content but this is a little too in your face with flavor too)."
"D: Very strong. Taste like the 13-14% that it is. Flavors are big and bold. 12oz is almost too much for me. I love DIPA (even in bomber bottles), but this one is almost too much for me."
"This is one of the most incredibly tasty beers I have ever had. Without a doubt, the best DIPA that has graced my lips with it's blessed bitterness. AMAZING! If this wasn't 13.6%, it would have scored a 5 on drinkability too, but something this strong just can't be """ultimately drinkable", however, it's damned close!!!"
"drinkability: give the above narratives, i'd say it held up alright"
"For a beer that I thought was going to be over the top bitter, this one ended up being incredibly balanced and unbelievably drinkable. Think Two-Hearted x2 and you'll get this bad boy from Dark Horse. Truely an exceptional beer all around."
"The hops are at the forefront of the taste, bitter orange and resinous, before lots of sweetness and heat kicks in through the middle. Bitterness stays with you throughout, with some interesting lightly toasted and bready notes floating about as well. Mouthfeel is very full and if it werent for the dominant hop presence, this would certainly venture more towards the big barleywine area. Finish is tongue-rippingly biter and quite warming from the alcohol. Definitely different, and impressively hoppy."
"This beer poured a dark orange/amber color and formed an off white head that disappeared slowly. The aroma was heavy mix of hops with some pine and caramel notes in the background. The flavor was of hops and a mix of caramel and other sweets. The finish was sweet and the alcohol was present and created a very warming effect afterwards."
"Thanks to an unknown saint for giving me a taste of this at the Dark Lord release, and thanks to hoppymeal for trading it to me. The combination hop and alcohol nearly spun my nose around when I took my first whiff. Beautiful pine hop,riding a wave of ethanol,cloudy amber orange color,huge hop citrus dominating taste,a sticky sweet malt try unsuccessfully to balance it and an everpresent huge alcohol taste. An absolutely wonderful hoppy sipping brew,a little more alcohol then I remember in my first taste,but I'm already working out a trade for more"
"Poured a deep hazed burnt orange with a very nice established one finger head that really stuck to the glass leaving a sheet of lace behind stupid me I poured kinda harsh letting all the chunks and floaties swirl about in the finish pour.Wholy shneikies is this thing fresh smelling like freshly and I means freshly mown grassover top pine neadles with a touch of hay just awesome.Quite dry on the palate not much residual sweetness that comes from alot of dipa's big and herbal with damp leaves that come to mind the malt base is more like that of cracker malt quite dry.Thick,resiny and chewey with a more noticable apricot-like flavor in the finish as I drink more.This has alot of complexities going on the alcohol comes as you drink more providing sweetness,a fine offering.Pure and simple its hop juice."
"12 oz bottles. This one pours a very dark and murky tea color with a pretty full coat over top that has just a few breaks in it. Clarity is not very good, and only a few stray bubbles are climbing up the side of the glass. Aroma is really where this one grabs me. Incredibly sweet and citrusy hops overlaying a very chunky caramel sweet malty base. There is not a lot more there, but I don't think there needs to be. Smells great. Flavor is not nearly as forceful as I expected. It hits first with a ton of caramel, moving to the citrusy and sweet hop flavors. Bitterness is only moderate, but still there. It doesn't get in the way of the flavors but really accentuates the finish with a little exclamation point. The malty sweetness is really thick...not offensive or obtrusive, but very prevalent. Mouthfeel on this one is thick, with a very light carbonation. The feel definately makes this one more of a sipper to me than something I can really drink fast, but at over 13%, that is a good thing. Dark Horse is really starting to impress me. I really need to make a trip to Michigan once I'm closer, as there is a lot I am missing by not having visited yet. This one is another winner."
"I did enjoy it though. I wish I had some more. Thank you very much MABZ for another fine beer."
"Full bodied here. This is probably from all of the malts needed to balance the bitterness, but it makes for a filling DIPA. Drinkability is fairly good. I'd like to see some more hop flavors come through to bump up the complexity and accompany the bitterness. I will say the alcohol presence, or lack thereof, is not bringing the drinkability down. This is a heavy hitter of a beer...I'm really feelin' this one..."
"This is closer to a triple than a double, but whatever they want to call it, its a winner all the way."
"Just phenomenal. Trade to get your hands on this."
"Pours a muddy, amber color. Somewhat low carbonation level but considering the abv I am not suprised. Big, hop aroma mixed with a sweet, caramel malt backround. Big,slick hop flavor. Not really bitter but a resiny, piney and oil like flavor. Sizeable malty presence. The alcohol is very discreetly hidden. Huge body. All ties together quite well. Very, very drinkable. I bet this would age well."
"Drinkability is laughable. I wouldn't want to drink another right now, and I don't know if I'll want to drink another. It was a good beer, but it's almost as over the top as Avery."
"Feel is dry with a big balance. Dusty grapefruit skin and orange peel"
"Hazy burnt orange/amber colour with a thin lace of fine bubbles. Spotty foam stickage to the glass. Big time pine aroma, like fresh pine needles. Grapefruit and malt kind of take a backseat until it warms a bit. More grapefruit up front in the flavour, with citrus throughout. Solid malt backbone with some pleasant caramel providing excellent balance to the strong bitterness. A bit of pine resin. Some toffee as it warms. Light alcohol warmth in the finish, with lingering orange citrus and pine. Full body, just short of sticky. The low, well-integrated carbonation makes for a pleasant texture that's a bit creamy. Alcohol is apparent, but very controlled. This is a killer beer - very well put together with great balance given the extremes that are playing against each other. Dark Horse is quickly becoming one of my favourite breweries."
"Pours a hazy iced tea brown, small white head forms and quickly settles into a thin layer with rings around the outside. Smell is grapefruit galore, lots of pine/floral, nice caramel, some spice and booze. Wow. Taste is amazing, caramel/citrus, and amazing grapefruit and pine through the middle, more citrus and pine near the finish, little bit of alcohol, clean bitterness. Mouthfeel is surpisingly thin, yeast must have eaten everything, carbonation is very low, almost nonexistant but thats how it should be. Very hot going down, but I find this perfectly balanced for being so huge. I can only say wow, this is fantastic. The 98 IBU's are held perfectly in check, can barely even taste the bitterness, and the alcohol is nicely contained, fantastic job. Thanks DrJay!!"
"A great beer to smell. Not an amazing beer to drink."
"Pure citrus orange aroma from hops, ahh such pleasure, with some malt. Very easy going down and yet so high in alcohol. Smooth and tasty, lots of hops well mated away so neither too bitter nor too sweet.Medium mouthfeel. I thought this was agreat for the style, from another great Michigan brewer. Thanks Dr. Jay."
" Taste is IIPA all the way, hell this is more of a triple IPA than DD. Rind of grapefruit, pine sap, fresh grass, and a lemon squeeze. Some caramel malt, but it is of no concern. Mouthfeel is oily, slick, and thick. Dangerously drinkable, I'd love to have another, but I have to go to work."
"Note: IMHO i think Dark Horse has rally stepped up the their game!"
"pours a hazy burnt copper with orange hightlights and a 1 inch near bright white head in a pint glass. laces well. aroma is of strong piney and citrusy hops. orangey with a sweet caramel aroma as well. first sip is surprisingly malty. don't get me wrong, there's some stong bitter hop character at first, but i was most impressed with a nice malty balance. lots of caramel coats huge citrusy grapefruit, orange and lemon peel hop bitterness. grassy, piney hops are very apparent as well. very sweet finish with a hop bitter aftertaste. the mouthfeel on this dipa is quite nice. thick creamy body that feels almost syrupy rolling around in your mouth. coats your mouth and throat with a silky swallow. very drinkable as well. finish and aftertaste keep you drinking and the alcohol is evident, but not a hinderance. overall, this is a very nice dipa. different from all my favorites in it's malty balance and mouthfeel, and definitely deserves to be at the top of this style."
"Nice glowing orange color, not much of a off white head. Very cloudy/hazy. Oily texture, that clings to the glass. Awesome smell, almost as good as Dreadnaught, but not quite. Lots of hops and malts, grapefruits, citrusy and pepper. Well balanced flavor of hops and big malts, sweet, spices and peppery. BIG mouthfeel, very heavy and thick. Fills the belly quickly. Some warm feeling, but not bad for an abv of 13.6%. The alcohol is hidden superbly. Surprisingly easy too drink, much easier than Devil Dancer, and better tasting. The alcohol does show it self more as the beer warms, but not overwhelming. A great offering from Dark Horse that is sure to please any fans of BIG IPA's. If you can find it, buy it!!!"
"Cheers to trbeer for this rare treat to celebrate the first day of March Madness!"
"These monstrous Michigan Double IPAs have me by the taste buds. First the Devils Dancer, now this. I cant get enough. Bursting and vibrant hop pungency in the nose, with hints of grapefruit rinds, toffee and caramel. So rich and flavourful, with an incredible hop potency giving hints of resin and grapefruit, along with a touch of caramel."
"This is definitely one of the coolest labels I have seen on a beer. The green wax covering the cap looks great with it. Very dark amber colored body with a tall tan head that left a good amount of sticky lacing. Damn this has a potent aroma. As soon I a popped the cap it seems the room filled with the huge hops and malt bursting out of this. Big piney and grapefruit in the aroma with a bit of lemon. Also coming on strong was the big fruitiness this had. Some alcohol was present but nothing to show it was almost 14%. Taste was just as big with pine sap and oily hops galore. This is definitely a palette destroyer, but sometimes thats a good thing. Nice bitterness is balanced by a big malty backbone with plenty of sweetness and fruit notes. Alcohol is more noticeable in the flavor and at time all the flavors dont seem to mesh well. Ends with a tongue raking bitter hoppy bite. Pretty damn thick and sticky sweet. Very warming and plenty of body. Drinkability could be better but the way the taste doesnt seem cohesive at time hurts this. I would have loved to try this fresh to see what a beast it was then. Very similar overall to Devil Dancer but not quite as refined in my opinion but a great beer none the less."
"This is a really cool, interesting, tasty beer. I think I need to take a break before finishing it off. But it's too good. It's almost up there with the top DIPA's, but not quite imho. Still, every B.A. needs to try this and see for themselves what Dark Horse can do."
"My taste buds have been scarred. This is masochism. A hop assault. Amazing, it takes a lot to get my attention these days. Thanks sooo much to jennt76 for the killer beers!"
"Can't say I'd be throwing back more than a couple of these...but, very well worth seeking out and enjoying once and a while."
"Thanks to trbeer for the hook up!"
"I've been impressed by the guys at Dark Horse by their range of stouts and how far they have pushed that style, but this just blows me away. Kinda hard to find, even in southern Michigan. If you find some get it. Get as much as you can."
"Drinkability is high even though IBU's and ABV are at the end of the upper scale. Agree with previous poster who kind of called a little sibling of Devil Dancer. Some balance of sweetness and aggresive hopping, just on a much lower scale. Another really well done beer from the folks in Marshall."
"That wax around the top sure looks nice, but man alive, its a bitch to get off. Once I finally got this bottle cracked open, I was treated to a nice sight. Double Crooked Tree pours a very deep, very murky amber-copper color with a slight head composed of very tightly knit bubbles. A little sediment is present too. Powerful aroma of pungent hops and caramel. Some floral qualities are more apparent as the beer warms slightly. Some sweet cinnamon and spice are also apparent. Powerful, spicy, slightly salty hops are first to the palate and never let go of their dominance. Some slight citrous notes also. The taste is farily well balanced for the 98 IBUs it boasts. Sweet malts are more present than you would think, as well as some caramel and a little toastiness. The 13.6% abv doesn't play any games, and is present throughout. The alcohol is most apparent in the finish, slightly burning as it goes down, and warming the body. Although the hops prickle a bit, they don't really sharpen the mouthfeel. For the most part, it is big and creamy. Not quite chewy, but definitely a full mouthfeel. I need to get a few more for the cellar to see what develops. A """must try""" double IPA if you can get your hands on this one."
"Very intense. Fans of this genre must not miss this."
