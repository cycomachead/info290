Taste is overwhelmingly bitter, but with a slight burnt caramel-like aftertaste that helps offset the bitterness and makes it quickly dissipate.  Hints of pine, resin, floral and citrus hops and nice sweet crystal malt.  Mouth is thinner than I expected but comes across as refreshing and almost dry, but with just a touch of malt body.

Medium full body and carbonation. The carbonation is very fine.","pat61","Feb 15, 2015"

Deep orange color with a very beige, off white (what, eggshell?) head that compacts to half finger and holds. The aroma is big citrus with some resinous stuff in there for good measure. The flavor is just a deep and sustained citrus hit that gets an add on of earthy pine across the palate, with a nice Simcoe bitter hit to round out the pine in the finish.

I don’t remember this brew being so soapy either, so since the recipe probably hasn’t changed, I guess my palate has done a bit of re-schooling. Can imagine this soapy character comes from using citra as a bittering hop, which really isn’t my thing. Still, this is a very well executed brew and has a lot of things I like about certain higher ABV double IPA’s. Well worth checking out especially if you like hopper brews with higher FG’s. Thanks again Frank for bringing this along all those years. It’s made me a curious searcher ever since. Cheers!","Jeffo","Nov 09, 2014"

There is a big hop bitterness here but also a nice balance to it, nice flavors of grapefruit, lemon, tangerine. One of the better imperial IPAs I've had.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

It's bitter complex and offers everything that beyond meets the expectations of a DIPA. I would rate it a notch higher but has slight room for improvement. Maybe with proper aging it can.

A definite bite of alcohol and hoppy goodness.  Finishes with a warm feel that lingers in back of throat.  Definitely not for the faint of heart.  A pretty smooth mid mouth feel.  Pretty accurately named.  I love this company more every time I try.","Gobearswalter34","Aug 19, 2014"

Really does challenge the palate. In fact, i think the initial taste was borderline overwhelming. However, the finish and aftertaste is so vibrantly citrus which is my favorite aspect of this beer. I love a beer I can still taste on the ride home and even once I get home. I don't say this often, but one of these bad boys is definitely enough. This isn't one of my favorites in the style, but it is quite an experience, and id recommend it to any hop head. Cheers!","Bone53","Aug 04, 2014"

A reddish golden bronze color sporting a nice creamy beige head, I am indeed preparing for a palate-wrecking experience. Skimmed a couple of reviews below and cannot resist mentioning ... To the guy who was confused, the mash is sparged with a further dose of hopped wart, as opposed to the more typical water. The basis for the beer is a hopped wort, further purged of fermentables by yet more hopped wort. In any event, the aroma here is perfumy sweet, floral and herbal yet with a subtle butterscotch vibe, citrus, vinous fruit like white wine, and some dry white pepper. Green Flash manages to coax some complex multifaceted hop flavors out of its IPAs and this is no exception. The initial tastes are on the light side, some candied ginger, sweet tropical mango and lychee, something decidedly floral ... Honeysuckle? These elements give way to some grapefruit and blood orange citrus, green tea ... The bitterness ain't wrecking my palate initially, although now there's some interesting burnt mint and leather flavors revealing themselves. Soapy, slick mouthfeel with a few bubbles but not too fizzy. And BOOM, there's the bitter: Juniper and menthol, celery stalk and black pepper. About halfway through the bottle, a rank, powerfully resinous bitterness assails the mouth, like oolong tea steeped with pine needles. Some dried apricot appears in the otherwise pungent finish. Quite thick and syrupy but this does little to reign in the hoppy assault. While I have had more bitter DIPAs, at least in terms of raw power, this one steals the show when it comes to balancing aggression with nuance. Had to track it down in BC rather than Alberta.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 30, 2014"

The aroma is big citrus hops, with distinct grapefruit notes, and hints of caramel malt in the background. The taste is also big hops, but splendidly balanced against the malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than the taste and aroma indicated but it's not at all thin or watery. A great big DIPA.","Luisfcarrizo","Apr 17, 2014"

Rich nose of grapefruit, with hints of other sweet citrus, over a light background of pine and caramel malt. Medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is on the low end of normal. The complex flavor profile is a hop assault over a nice caramel balance. Grapefruit begins the assault with notes of other citrus. It then progresses to pine coupled with a nice intense bitterness that is pine and grapefruit rind. Towards the end, a well balanced caramel sweetness emerges to somewhat soothe the palate. The finish is an alcohol burn at the back of the throat with lingering bitterness and tartness. This one is not for the faint hearted.","tillmac62","Mar 18, 2014"

The company says it is made with hopped wort... but all IPAs are made with hopped wort so I'm not sure why they advertised that in this particular beer? Also the 12 oz was under half the price of the 22 oz, so not sure what the incentive would be to buy the 22 oz... (maybe they weren't expecting the liquor store to sell the 12s as singles).

I've had their West Coast IPA before; this seemed less bitter, but I didn't realize until after I bought it that it's also an old bottle (1/8/13). However, that didn't seem to matter, as the hops don't seem to have faded but rather melded nicely with the rest of the beer. I'd like to try this fresh as well for comparison. Definitely worth a try, and I'll be getting this again.","moneyturtle","Mar 12, 2014"

I don't favor it as much as the other Green Flash double ipa's, but its still something ill buy every year. This is just another great offering from G Flash. It has equal quality and class to their other double ipa's, but still remains different in character. This is more traditional ipa turned up a few notches.

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, slightly crisp, a little sticky, not too filing and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, i don't have the urge to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a very nice looking beer, it had good color, head and lacing. What I liked the least about this beer was the heavy green onion/garlic aspect, it just doesn't blend well with the other hoppy aspects. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a DIPA that I like more for a better price. I would recommend this as a good DIPA unless you really like the onion/garlic aspect. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, I've heard that many people enjoy this beer, but I can't say that was the case for me, those onion/garlic hops really held this beer back from being as good as it could be. This isn't my favorite DIPA and it didn't make for the best first impression for Green Flash, better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me.","StoutHunter","Feb 25, 2014"

If you have a penchant for bitter brews...this might be your weapon of choice. For the price, however, I will take Stone's Ruination without a thought. This is my 4th Green Flash brew and although I enjoy Palate Wrecker, I will prefer their Green Bullet, as it is much more unique. If/When Green Flash' satellite brewery in Virginia Beach, VA launches, I hope that brews like Palate Wrecker will be more affordable in the East Coast....until then, I will take Stone's Ruination IPA.

Also reducing the rating on mouthfeel from 4.5-4. But it's still so good, I'm surprised it's almost gone already.

Smell is fruity with a little pineapple, orange, and a little a little mango. There is seems to be a little sweet malt in the background that gives the beer a tiny bit of balance in the nose but it's hop forward to be sure. Taste is definitely a little more malty in the mouth with a little leather and sweetness but the hops are the spotlight with the fruit smelled in the nose but more bittering hops as it's drank and slides down the throat. To be clear there is a little bitterness in the mouth but it really is more so in the throat. Mouthfeel is fairly thin to a tad thicker which is great for the style. Overall this is a nice example of this type of beer. I really like it.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 26, 2013"

It reeks of scent, flavor, mouth-feel, and anything else you might want. It has grapefruit notes out-the-arse, and it does indeed, 'wreck' you palate. But that's only an issue if you want to eat during, not after. Chase this with a slice of pizza, a filet mignon, or ceviche- it doesn't matter. Your palate- true to word- will be cleansed, save for a slightly lingering citrus note. They should--- for diet conscious customers--- put out nutrition info, this must be ~250-300 cal/bottle, if that matters to you. With that said, enjoy.

The taste was aggressively hoppy with a great blend of citrus, dank and piney hop flavors to make it a perfect Hop Bomb. While it covered my palate with a hoppy resinous residue it was surprisingly drinkable and an enormously enjoyable Double IPA. In short, I loved this beer.","brurevu","Sep 03, 2013"

Taste starts out with very bitter piney hops right off the bat, with some sweeter fruity hops following, more subdued. It gets more drinkable after each sip, and the caramel malt is more noticeable as it warms. Hop-heads will love this; others may find it too bitter. A great in-your-face DIPA; don't be expecting something called """Palate Wrecker""" to be subtle.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 20, 2013"

I've tasted several well-balanced, surprising delicious Imperial / Double IPAs recently that let the malts share the stage with a hop extravaganza, proving that a big beer can be both hop-forward and balanced, which is what made them quality beers. This beer is the opposite of that concept. It's going to be a while before my tongue forgives me.

It looks rich and full of flavor... almost overflowing with it. The aroma is very bright and bursting with fruit esters - kiwi, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, and a little dash of brown sugar. Getting to the actual flavor - it's got a good amount of malt sweetness that I did not expect, and the hop aspects start off with that grapefruit juiciness, then it evolves to"""resinous," to a final super piny, drying bitterness. I welcome the harshness of the finish. It's amazing how one beverage goes from juicyfruit to such a sharp dryness. I love it. It's a heavy beer too, beware.

Stacks of bitterness dominate without all the ancillary hop flavors that I know and love. This tastes like what happens when I cook and reduce an IPA too much for the rest of the recipe. Bitterness is great, but not when it is standing alone. I suppose it is living up to its name of wrecking palates, and I can appreciate that, but I want more. More citrusy grapefruit, more malt backbone, or more sticky resin, this is a good beer but needs another dimension to become a great one.","watermelonman","Jun 11, 2013"

Green Flash has bottled pure hop essence in a container that can barely hold it, as I found out with just a single whiff. I can honestly say that this is one of the hoppiest beers I’ve ever had, which is a distinction I don’t take lightly.

Flavor is almost entirely bitter grapefruit pith, grapefruit rind, a tiny hint of grapefruit and a bit of pine. Very little malt character, very much a hop forward beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with low carbonation. The beer hid it's alcohol content quite well. An excellent hop forward beer, pure citrus and bitterness, probably one of the best west coast DIPAs I've tasted.","Auraan","Apr 21, 2013"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear amber pour, with a small white head that left some splashes of lace on the glass. As would be expected, the aroma was dominated by hops, citrus pith and pine resin, with hints of a caramel malt backbone bringing up the rear. Lots of orange and grapefruit in the taste, resin, pretty intense WC hop bitterness, with a little tropical fruit and malt sweetness to take the edge off, but the hops were clearly in charge. Maybe not as intense as their regular IIPA, though I'd like to try them back to back to test that theory. Medium body, appropriately carbonated. Maybe a little intense for greenhorns, but a good brew for hopheads.","Rifugium","Apr 19, 2013"

The alcohol is covered up really well but still has a nice sting at the end. Mouth is quite smooth and medium bodied. Slightly above average carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall, I love this brew. You usually don't get this type of pine smell or taste in a beer. Usually it's more of a pine needle taste, but in this it's more like the resin from the tree. I was actually expecting this to be way more bitter than it is, but I think they basically reached the point where it's so bitter that it doesn't really seem bitter. This is definitely one of my favorite IPAs. I'm not sure if I like this or the Imperial IPA they make more. I guess this would be more for a hophead, while the Imperial is less bitter but has a lot more in the way of character.","MisSigsFan","Apr 13, 2013"

Personal preference perhaps, but I feel this is middle of the road (or a slight step above) for a DIPA today.","Huhzubendah","Mar 30, 2013"

Amber in color with a somewhat short head, but that's okay given the abv. It's got that dill/green onion and sour cream thing going on in the nose from the hops- I happen to love those notes, but I know many do not. Really nicely bitter in the mouth, with an almost beefy flavor rife with the herbal and onion notes as well as some pine to give it some backbone. This is no citrus bomb, but if you're into this profile you'll love it. Very firm in the mouth at first, but then with a creamy finish and a long, mouthwatering, lingering bitterness.

The aroma was very piney and spicy and very much in line with the West Coast style. The taste is where the complexity started to show up. There was a mouth puckering, tobacco like bitterness up front which stayed throughout the taste. The initial shock of bitter was followed by some tropical fruits, such as mango and pineapple. The finish was spicy, with notes of ginger and clove. The beer felt very dry and did not show much of the character of the malt. This definitely lived up to its name, as I can't imagine having another beer after this, except if it's another Palate Wrecker.","rajendra82","Mar 15, 2013"

Especially as I’m getting toward the end of my glass, the bitterness builds and builds with each sip that I take. I’ve been hearing raves about this beer for a while and I’m so glad that I finally got to try it. It’s insanely drinkable for a beer this bitter that clocks in a nearly 10% ABV.

Some reviews say that it's unbalanced...not enough malts. Well, it's called Palate Wrecker; balance was not the objective. That being said, it is still extremely drinkable if you like the style. While it might not be so """balanced""" in a traditional sense, it is delicious. This is a great beer, though not for everyone.","DIPA10","Feb 24, 2013"

A hearty, heady mix of resin, pine, tropical fruit, pineapple, and citrus make for quite the hop presence. The bitterness is pretty intense as well, and just seems to keep increasing into the long finish. I feel like there are hop flowers stuck to the roof of my mouth. Warming notes of fruity alcohol also grace the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy, thick feel. Gentle carbonation takes pity on my alpha acid wracked mouth. Palate wrecker? Maybe, but I like it.","alexgash","Feb 23, 2013"

The smell is amazing, best beer I have ever smelled. The crazy amount of fruit in the nose is intoxicating. The flavor, while being able to hold its own, seemed to be the most neglected part of this beer. Amazing legs, crazy awesome scent, mouthfeel for days, and a flavor that leaves you wanting more fruit. The bitterness could be toned back, and with that, the ABV, I think would make this beer much more palatable and much more sensational fruit and pine. While I don't regret buying this, if I was looking for a radical beer full of fruit, I would grab a Green Flash West Coast IPA.","Brewsephus","Feb 05, 2013"

The first few sips were top notch with that piny IPA very strong on the tongue. You quickly realize why it's called Palate Wrecker since it definitely burns out some taste buds the more you drink. For me, this Imperial IPA class is stacked with world class beers and this might have fell short of the upper tier by just a bit. Definitely a must try and one I'd go back to but the heaviness of the hops on the tongue made it fall just a tad short.","sjones5045","Jan 24, 2013"

There are plentiful tiny bubbles visible rising in the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts with citrus (grapefruit and orange) and piney hops. The hop aroma is pretty intense. The first sip lives up to the namesake of the beer. The hops burst in the mouth with the piney hops and the citrus hops are there, but not as strong. The malts are there in the backbone, providing some nice bready sweetness. The alcohol is well-masked here and I can't even taste it at all. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Jan 24, 2013"

Aromas blast the nose with citrus and floral hops, both tart and resiny. Very inviting and powerful nose. Flavors are all over the palate. Initial blast of resiny hops, both oily and bitter, followed quickly by floral highlights and a tropical fruit blend of grapefruit and pineapple. The caramel malt backbone does its best to balance this behemoth. The hops also impart a solid spiced highlight, mostly pepper, throughout the brew. Tangy and very bitter aftertaste, leading to a slightly oily, dry finish.

A burst of pineapple, citrus floral notes, mango, a touch of caramel malt, and grapefruit rind bitterness that is balanced out on the finish by the sweetness of the unrelenting malt body.

Lots of pine, tangerine, grapefruit (tons of grapefruit), some pineapple, nice dose of underlying biscuity malt with a touch of sweetness. Bitter, metallic, sweet, pine, resin, more resin, some grapefruit peel, some nice spicy hops - really hoppy (haven't said that in a while). Medium bodied with small, sharp fleeting carb leaves a active feeling beer with a character wet almost slick finish. Nice mouthfeel here. Good beer.","harrymel","Dec 30, 2012"

Aroma includes a ton of grapefruit and pine, exploding from the glass.

The nose comprises pine resin, citrus salad, and a kiss of booze. The taste finally brings the name's promise to fruition: The bitterness on display burned through my tastebuds like vikings at Lindesfarne. It was all rind, resin, oils, and whatnot, with no real hop flavors besides. An alcohol kick comes forth as well, creating a sense of vinyl/rubber when combined with the bitterness and the subsequently shell-shocked tongue. Things are too much for me, and they definitely detract from any kind of enjoyment on my part. Many pain winces were evinced. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, I suppose this beer delivers what it promises, but that's not really a good thing...","TMoney2591","Oct 25, 2012"

Head eventually settles into a quarter inch cap embedded with pinpricks and ringlets. Thin, textured clusters of lacing are present during the tasting and exhibit good adhesion. Nose expresses citrus rind, light, candied fruit, ethanol, an earthy character and honeydew melon. Taste follows nose; however the alcohol somewhat over-asserts itself, masking many of the qualities present in the nose. Finishes with a light, lingering, earthy bitterness that gradually dissipates between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a slightly oily texture and an even carbonation level. Overall, I have to say that I enjoy my DIPAs with a little more sweetness and tropical fruit; however, this was definitely a solid brew and worth trying.","Jwale73","Jun 07, 2012"

Murky to opaque orange rust colored liquid, more red than yellow tint, very few visible bubbles. The nose is classic, lots of orange to grapefruit citrus, pine, honeyed bread, flowers, pepper and milk chocolate, fills out with resonant pineapple, peach, nectarine fruit scents, thick and syrupy nostril texture, too dense to really lift much. Full-bodied, the carbonation relatively light for the heaviness you get here too, glues itself to your mouth pores as well. Pine sap, cocoa, orange and both white and pink grapefruit pith, the bitterness creates the initial impression of dryness, however, it stays juicy through the flowers and pineapple, mango, nectarine, apricot fruit. The pepper and earth components extend the finish, lots of reverb, even more prickle than expected with the so-so carbonation. Isn’t breaking new flavor territory but amplifies everything while staying well balanced. That honey sneaks out onto stage through the finish, brings some caramel and molasses along.

Aroma earthy, citrus grapefruit layers of hops, dank mary jane, you name a hop character or aroma and I'm sure you can find it in this beer. The one characteristic that reigns supreme in this beer is the grapefruit pith it just flows out of the glass, flavor wise it borders as a barleywine big assertive alcohol with malts wrapped around it. Gotta love the West Coast hops, more waves of bitterness and hop flavors including more grapefruit bombs, earthy dirt, and again marijuana. Evident sticky hop oils on the palate yet lighter bodied than most DIPA/B wines out there they kept the palate surprisingly clean for this type of a beer, moderate carbonation works with this type of beer excellent feel to it. Overall I'm impressed I had it on draft a couple years back at a Penn Fest and it blew my mind, I'm not saying I have the same feeling as I did then but it's damn good.","WVbeergeek","May 21, 2012"

3.87,-7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Green Flash Palate Wrecker pours a fairly hazy orange, with no real highlights to speak of. The pour yields three fingers or so of just off white foam. Head retention is fairly good, with some chunky, spotty lacing left behind. The nose is nicely potent, with a fair split of grapefruit and pine aromas shining through. The flavor leads off with just a hint of candied sugar and caramel sweetness. Quickly, a raw, aggressive, intense bitterness rolls through, filling up the mid palate. This is the kind of tongue shredding action you need if you're going to call your beer """Palate Wrecker""".The hoppy finish isn't as flavorful as I'd like. There's some amount of it, with the citrus component being more orange than grapefruit to balance with the resinous pine notes, but it's not attention grabbing. The mouthfeel isn't all that great, it's a little chewy and a little undercarbonated for the style. Palate Wrecker's got it's flaws, but it's a nice, aggressively bitter imperial IPA.","axeman9182","May 13, 2012"

However, I don't pick up quite as much citrus in the taste (as compared to the aroma). Mostly I taste a lot of bitter pine hops, along with some citrusy hops (mango, grapefruit) and a little caramel malt. There's a good lingering bitter hoppy finish.

This looks picture perfect for a DIPA. The aroma has aromatic dry hopped goodness all over it. Bright tropical notes are balanced by deep notes of resinous pine with some grapefruit in there as well. Malts are present on the nose in the form of sweet caramel, bread, and graham cracker. The taste is big and bold with hops from beginning to end. The malts are present up front with mellow bready sweetness, dank hops quickly take hold as this thing is a hop monster. The deep bitterness of the pine is brightened up by some tropical fruit. The body is big and the carbonation is moderate to high. Overall, this beer has a truly impressive hop bill.

4.33,4.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light to medium coppery amber, massive fine off-white head with good retention and tons of lacing. Color, head and active carbonation give a nice look to this IPA. Intense aroma of grapefruit, pine and herbal hops and sweet malt. Flavor follows, with intense piney hops, citrus balanced by sweet malt. A long, resinous bitter hop finish and aftertaste. The malt supports the hops assault well. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess and nice mouth feel from the healthy carbonation. I opened this with a bit of trepidation because Green Flash ales are sometimes a bit astringently bitter for me and this was named to put fear into my heart. It is very hop forward, but the malt body supports it well and I enjoyed this very much. Nicely done, but you really have to like intense hops.","LiquidAmber","Apr 20, 2012"
4.42,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- The taste is somewhat deceiving and starts out a little sweet and then the hoppy bitterness takes over. I opened this beer just slightly too cold but as the temperature rose the flavor became more complex. This is called palate wrecker for a reason. Drinking most beers after drinking this would be very low on taste. (and why would you want to) As a hophead this beer really hits the spot. Well done!","Dalgren","Apr 20, 2012"
4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The palate is pretty excellent. Big, bold, resiny and mildly sweet, this does make a strong case for its name. Bold pine and grapefruit, with less weed than the nose would suggest, this is wonderfully resiny and bitter, juicy, mildly fruity and nicely palate-coating. Some sweetness is present, but really, this is a wonderful example what a mindfully bitter DIPA should be. The sweetness is a little more than I like, though. Medium-light in body with mild-moderate carbonation, this feels pretty great on the palate. Bitter, resiny, hoppy finish with a mildly green hop character, this is pretty excellent. The sweetness is increasingly noticeable as I work through the bomber, not enough to make me slow down, but enough to be noticed.

The beer is a hop bomb so the aroma is heavy on the hops. Mostly citrus with a bit of pine. I love hops but this is almost so strong it's uninviting. The beer is bitter, not nearly to Ruination's level but bitter. Unbalanced. Very resiny with pine and earthy tones more prevalent than the nose suggests. Hides the alcohol well though.

A foamy latticework of lace forms down the glass with each sip. Smell is of citrus zest, grapefruit, and herbal hops. Taste is of intense citrus zest, citrus fruit, and grapefruit extract. There is a pretty assertive bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slight crispness and a medium bodied mouthfeel.

There is a good reason they call this bad boy “Palate Wrecker”, there is nothing smooth or subtle about this brew. It's an in your face HOP A-BOMB! This brew pours a brilliant golden orange with a fingers worth of a white head that leave nice lacing. The aroma is amazing and is very reminiscent of “Pliny the Elder” in that it has big citrus and pine notes to it. My first thought after I tasted it... “What the %^&* just happened to my tongue?” I could feel my pupils dilate as my taste buds were obliterated by a bitterness like I've never tasted before. There is absolutely no malt backbone to balance out the hop bitterness but who cares? That's why I bought this beer, to be blown away by a super hoppy beer and “Palate Wrecker” more than fits the bill.","Topher78","Mar 31, 2012"

Less floral and fruity than Green Flash's other IPA's this beer pours a very light copper color and hits you with hardcore hop and long lasting burnt bitter flavor. While this is a beer worth appreciating, it's hard to see myself drinking more than one at a time, the appealing flavors of the IPA don't really seem to be existent. In that sense, it doesn't live up to the advertisement on the bottle that it is a very complex beer, more it's an experimental specialty brew pushing the limits of layered dry hopping in the IPA style.","BenHesk12","Mar 30, 2012"

I have really grown to like IPA's as of recent because of the mix between different hops and aromas that really come out. This beer smelt like a true hop king. I wanted to sit there smelling it all night. The appearance was good, but with a smell like it had, i didn't much care what it looked like. The taste was great too, again, if your a hop lover, otherwise be prepared for a smack in the face. I am not going to say there is nothing else to the beer, but the hops are so prevalent it was hard for me to taste much else. Mouth feel was good, strong.

You immediately get slapped in the face with intense bitterness and grapefruit. This beer definitely has a lingering bitter finish. Nice blend of tropical and citrus fruits with an immense amount of pine and a bit of earthy flavors.

3.18,-23.6,4,3.5,3,4,2.5,"Another double IPA from Green Flash, and although I was unimpressed with their bottled imperial IPA, I was eager to give this one a shot (mainly based on my love for the IPA and red). Again, I was disappointed. Poured a fairly clear orange-amber color, with a fairly solid white head. Big hoppy nose (shock!)--grapefruit, orange zest, weed leads to a body that is similarly overrun with hops, along with a little malt, apparently in an effort to keep this one balanced. Like with the IIPA, it doesn't work. For whatever reason, Green Flash's IIPAs just don't work for me, although I generally love the style as well as pretty much everything else Green Flash brews.","emmasdad","Oct 10, 2010"
3.65,-12.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Palate Wrecker almost lives up to it's name, but even after I finished it I could still sense that the malt was weak. Good? Bad? Meh, you be the judge of that. For me it was nice, but would like to see more malt to counter the hops as they strive for Lemon Pine Sol level. This might be very good with spicy dishes, if you like spice and pain. Otherwise it would be a bit tough to drink.","Mebuzzard","May 08, 2010"

I guess it was balanced, but it's hard to judge since this was a hop assault and just a very tasty beer that any hop-head will enjoy. The 9% ABV was well hidden and this beer went down very easy. A definite recommendation.","CHickman","Apr 02, 2010"

4.17,0.2,4.25,4,4.25,4.5,4,"I've since had bottles of this, it seems to go back and forth descriptor wise between a barleywine and a dipa. I prefer it fresh, and subsequent batches (like even the Toronado BW fest) have been heavier malt wise at times, but then the last one was lighter and more dipa tropical fruit edges to it. Either way, drink asap on the first one to decide where you want it to go from there. Good with or without age.","Beerandraiderfan","Mar 23, 2010"

4.32,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The name is befitting, as this beer is bitter as hell. It attacks my palate with fury and malice. The bitterness has a nice backing of hop flavor with resiny pine and grapefruit. A low level of caramel sweetness is evident, but it doesn't approach balancing. The finish is dry and very, very bitter with noticeable alcohol lingering line. The mouthfeel is dry and sticky. A damn fine and very bitter double IPA. This is a veritable palate wrecker.","HopHead84","Nov 12, 2009"

4.48,7.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Umm, wow. Pours hazy orange-gold with an impressive short-but-thick white head. Colossal citrus/floral hop aroma. Grapefruit and pine oil just pound you in the face. The taste surpasses the nose. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and truckloads of resin. A tad more citrus than earthy pine, but who cares. Just a little caramel malt to give it a hint of sweetness. I really have to thank the Green Flash guys for not making the chronic mistake of putting too much malt in and making this a sour-candy DIPA. Its nearly perfect the way it is.","magictrokini","Dec 08, 2008"
4.6,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Holy shit! God, Green Flash loves its hops. The Palate Wrecker was poured from a gravity cask. It is hazy amber-orange color with no head (obviously because of the cask). Nevertheless, the color profile is phenomenal. The smells is intensely and absurdly of wonderfully fruity hops. The taste is the same. It is right in your face hops. Incredible! The taste also has a strong malty-sweet balance to it. Just amazing. Lots of grapefruit and orange...kind of resin-y. This beer really does wreck your palate. If you are lucky enough to come across it get it. It's awesome.","Douglas14","Nov 14, 2008"
