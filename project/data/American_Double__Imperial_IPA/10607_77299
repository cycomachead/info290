4.81,17.6,5,4.5,5,4.75,4.75,"this is a winner in my book. Poured from a 12oz tall can into shaker pint glass.  Appearance is  pale orange with a 1/4 """ of white foam that dissipates slowly with moderate lacing. Bubbles rising throughout the glass. Nose offers hints of pine and grapefruit hoppiness. Mouthfeel is true to its name. Flavor starts with a slight biscuity malt backbone then Resin takes over and coats the palate with pine flavor mixing into and finishing with grapefruit.Leaves the mouth feeling coated and almost anesthetized but also savoring the taste and wanting more. Hardly notice the alcohol in the taste and at 9.1% abv this ones a shitkicker to be reckoned with for sure. ","Stebbimacdaddy","Mar 11, 2015"

4.01,-2,4.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Deep orange with a touch of rust color and a white head that lasts for a while and deposits some nice chunky lace.  Aromas of citrus, herbal hop, slight pine and a burnt sugar note in the background.  As expected the hops are what this beer is all about.  Flavors of bitter citrus, caramel, grapefruit, and light pine in the finish.  Mouthfeel has enough carbonation up front, smooths out and finishes semi dry.  Alcohol is well hidden and that brings about a pretty dangerous level of drinkability for a brew this big.  This delivers as a DIPA worthy of a throw in to a regular mix.  It's not the best out there but it has a nice blend of classic flavors that make this one an instant winner.","HopBomb515","Mar 06, 2015"

4.39,7.3,2.25,3.25,5,4.75,5,"Purchased at Total Wine, Tampa, 1/2015. Translucent amber color with white head. Smells of pine, hops, resin, grapefruit, and a hint of candied strawberry/Now-and-Later taffy. Taste parallels much the same with robust piney hops and that sweet candy aftertaste that is almost reminiscent of bubble gum. A very rich and thick IPA that coats the mouth and throat with caramel malts and candied sweetness. I liken this beer very much to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra, but a little thicker, stickier, and danker. Simply a world-class DIPA. 4.39/5","CraigS119","Feb 04, 2015"

I like the huge syrupy feel along with the malty character, but I think the strong caramel flavor takes just a bit too much from the rest of the beer. certainly a beer to revisit for me but as of now, not quite breaking to the elite level for me.","SportsandJorts","Aug 11, 2014"
4.55,11.2,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I am re-reviewing this beer because the first one I had had been stored inproperly at room temperature for a very long time. I originally gave a bad review...WELL, WELL, WELL, what a difference it makes when the beer has been stored properly and is fresh. Wow, is all I can say. The color is a beautiful orangeish color and has a nice head that lingers. I still get the malt sweetness but it is balanced so well with the hops and IBUS that I dare to say that this may be one of the top 10 best beers I have tried. The sweetness hits first, followed by tropical fruits and finishes with a very very pleasant bitterness like citrus peel that is very nice on my palate. I am so excited to try more from Sixpoint that I cant even sit down !!!!!!!!!!!!!. Good job, I will defoinately put this beer on my list to share with friends, Great job!!!!!!!!","hophugger","Aug 10, 2014"

The beer lives up to its name of hop resin oil being the main focus of this beer, but there some malt balance to this beer. I think I could definitely revisit this beer again, maybe with the right food, but by itself it's really quite something.","damndirtyape","Jul 28, 2014"

For a beer that shows off it's 9.1 ABV and 103 IBU, this one is smooth and very drinakable. I should have nabbed a case!","SFNC","Jul 18, 2014"

The nose is a blast of piney, resinous hops, with floral, spicy notes along with some sweet caramel malt, toasted. The taste starts with sweet caramel malt, toasted, bready but transitions to sweet, sticky citrus hops and finishes long and dry with good old American bittering hops. The body is rich and creamy with nice carbonation. This is a really nice, balanced beer; as it warms, the bittering hops really start to take over.","mtomlins","Jun 27, 2014"

Nice, clean refreshing mouthfeel. Crisp with no funny lingering aftertastes. Solid DIPA.","Mikus","Jun 15, 2014"

First, the aroma and taste are dominated by pine and then a little grapefruit, but mainly pine. This lends to a bitter dipa despite a sold malt backing. The malt consisting of some bread and some caramel sweetness. I must say while this is a  good beer, but after a year of beer drinking this beer is tasting different to me. I remember the citrus/floral aspect being big, but I don't recall the pine being so dominate when I last tried it in 2013. Overall I'd say this is a solid dipa, however, the pine isn't pleasant to me. The malt helps to balance the bitter/pine a bit, but not enough. Still, this is a beer I will revisit, and one that I would recommended. (85/100)","CTbrew32","Apr 26, 2014"

Big piney hops with a faint sweetness and a little astringency. Taste is a wallop of hops up front, piney and slightly medicinal with a sticky sweetness, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is a just a little to the slick side but fairly well carbonated. Overall, a damn nice Double IPA to pick up.

Very gauzy haze to the otherwise borderline luminescent orange to yellow color, opaque with a very fine particulate visible, similarly the carbonation is active but so tiny you have to peer way up close to see it. The nose plays it straight up, maybe somewhat high toned, slaps on the pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus, pine sap, bread crust, saline, pressed dried flowers, cocoa and a wedge of apricot and peach fruit, leaves a drying sensation in your nostrils, kind of a masculine showoff. Full-bodied, thick and layered even as the dryness sucks all the moisture out of your mouth. The carbonation gives it a creamy texture but it is hard to register this. The grapefruit, lime, orange citrus has flavor but not so much sweetness, lacks length. So, it’s the pine, salt, cut grass, pepper led spice and pumpernickel type bread which gets out to play. Teeters on the edge of too dry and bitter but manages to stay relatively balanced. Masks alcohol decently. Not sure I could drink more than two in a sitting, the second would be a slow affair.","farrago","Oct 04, 2013"

4.2,2.7,4,4,4.25,4,4.5,"Clear, orange amber colored body, with a smaller than typical head for the style, but with a lot of latent carbonation steamers. The smell was a bit more subdued than I expected, with some grapefruit and mango, and ironically not a lot of pine resin. The taste was a bit more of a hop showcase, as there was a lot of herbal notes up front. The malt showed up more forcefully shortly afterwards, and gave a tropical punch (mostly orange and pineapple) like sweetness, before fading away into a floral hop finish. Clean feel in the mouth, tending be be neither too slippery nor too sticky. Not the best DIPA I've ever had, but very comforting to fall back to a familiar pleasure from time to time.","rajendra82","Aug 13, 2013"

Medium bodied and smooth, this beer tastes like it smells with a prevelant hop taste profile, dirty, earthy citric hops with touch of grape and there is some minor sweetness (fruit hops or caramel?). Finishes clean with a little crispness thanks to carbonation and ABV is hidden. Affordable and dangerously high ABV sippin' DIPA that is a must try.","clayrock81","Aug 01, 2013"

The aroma is very floral and super hoppy but with a candy-like sweetness behind. The taste is great for the style, but this isn't my IPA. Too much of piney/resinous hop character. I admit that it is well balanced and has the great hop forwardness people enjoy in DIPAs; however, I just can't get into this beer. I find this beer a tad thin for a DIPA too. I do enjoy the hop bite on my tongue. I'll definitely suggest this beer for people who like more pine or resin or earth in their IPAS.","mverity","Jun 18, 2013"

The aroma is big and sweet, with sweet tropical hops and sweet caramel malts. The taste isn't quite as sweet as the nose, with some more hop bitterness kicking its way through. It's a balanced bitterness, as the bitter and sweet aspects from the hops are kinda in a tug-of-war the whole time. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Sixpoint Resin is a great DIPA.","shand","Jun 14, 2013"

Piney hops, lots of resins, tangerine and grapefruit. As a point of interest -the tangerine in this beer literally fills up your mouth like a real tangerine. It’s is the most accurate tasting of a specific fruit in a beer that I have ever noticed. Good citrus with a sugary and pungent nose. Taste is breaddy with a honey sweetness. Woody grassy hops play off the ripe fruit and the citrus lends a slight pucker. Silky malt that has plenty of caramel and brown sugar. Finishes nice and bitter with a bit of grapefruit, a bit of alcohol warmth and plenty of oils to coat the palate; but they don’t disturb the palate. It’s a little chewy in the finish with strong tea like qualities and toasted malt flavor. Grand.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Pine bitter dominates but fades into some sweet malt and then back to a very dry bitter pine finish. The malt profile really balances this nicely while letting the hops shine.

4.12,0.7,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Pours a toasted, hazy amber hue into my tasting glass. The tall can it comes in reminds me of a 'Red Bull.' An initial frothy head recedes to barely a thin ring, but on the plus side there is a sticky mess of lacing down the glass. Great look. It's smells wonderful - mostly pineapple, grapefruit, cream & caramel. Fairly straightforward. The flavor exudes the 'resinous' variety of hops as the name suggests, but also a subtle caramel, candy-ness of the malts, and a certain earthy aspect I cannot quite put my finger on, but I like it. It's mouthfeel is medium, just coating the mouth thinly, with an alcohol heat that you notice before long. The beer is numbing on the back of your throat, leaving you wanting another pleasant sip. Overall, this is simultaneously sweet and bitter. A great east coast IPA. Well done Sixpoint, a brewery close to home.","Neorebel","Feb 10, 2013"

Lacing is clear and quick to slide away. Aroma includes peach and persimmon with some apricot and some malt sweetness in the background. Taste includes some caramel sweetness and some hop bitterness but far from the amount expected, given the name and style. I actually checked the date of the keg to make sure it was fresh and it is from 12/2012. No issues there.

It could definitely get better in the color and aroma category, but i feel these two areas don't detract from my overall impression of this beer.

Taste is nice and bitter pine and citrus, a bit oversweet on the malt backing though. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel seems a bit flat - would appreciate a little more carbonation. On the other hand, the tongue-coating thickness of this beautifully bittered imperial is fanstastic. Aftertaste is puckering. I really wanted to like this more - I love resinous beers (Green Flash!) so I imagined a beer called """Resin""" to be near perfect.

The nose comprises grapefruit rind, pine resin (how appropriate), thickly earthy and spicy greens, mild toffee, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis on the earth, spice, and pine, and with some light balsa joining the party as well. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a refreshingly earthy hop-bomb, one that definitely uses plenty of hops but does so without burning the tongue and without completely ignoring the concept of balance.","TMoney2591","Oct 25, 2012"

It has a strong, fresh aroma of grapefruit and lumber. It smells almost a touch sour-- """nose tart""". It's very full and soft in the mouth and it leaves the tongue a little singed. It's bursting with fresh hop flavor and quite bitter. Grapefruit peel bitterness becomes wooden and, finally, resiny at the finish and throughout the aftertaste, where it picks up some juniper and black pepper. The whole affair is pretty dry. I really love a beer like this. It's strong and heavy enough to support all those hops and the malt never creates any conflict.","yesyouam","Oct 21, 2012"

Really should be discussed as a barleywine in my opinion, but at the same time, despite what the majority thinks, its just a matter of degree and subtle differences between some dipas and barleywines. Relatively easy to drink for a 9% beer. I like the unique can shape and size, its like you're holding an energy drnk. Really makes for good sneaking into college football games, security just thinks you are drinking some rare -bal red bull or something.

3.87,-5.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a can into a perfect pint glass. Light and hazy orange/gold. About a finger of white head that disappears rather quickly. Decent retention on glass. This appears to be a very good beer. Smell is amazing, with sweet pine and citrus aromas and a bit of malt. Taste is where this falls off slightly. I am not disappointed with the taste, but I think it must be a combination of factors that lead to my slightly above average taste rating. Pine and citrus flavors are prominent, but grapefruit rind sort of dries out any sweetness I may have picked up from the smell. It's not bad, but the taste is not as appealing to me as other beers like this. I suppose it is resinous, too. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, almost like a bite of bread, or something similar. Overall this is a decent beer. It's unique, too, and that is why I say that I still enjoy it, even though some elements are not as agreeable as some of my favorite DIPA's.

Beers like Sierra Nevada's 'Hoptimum' and Dogfish Head's 'Burton Baton' are shining examples of well-rounded, balanced, complex IIPAs.

THe first sip is easy-going and then WHAM! comes the total hop overload - which is very delicious. On the other hand, it is not up the greatest it could attain. It is not a balanced Double IPA in a way that Dogfish or Rogue makes theirs.

Taste is bitter and sticky with just a hint of alcohol in there. There's a hint of malt sweetness but the flavor here is all about the hoppage. Resin, pine, garlic, hints of citrus all come together to slap my taste buds to and fro.

Flavors are rich in hops character, with a dark, wet, and green blast on the tongue and roof of the mouth, followed by the solid malt layered backbone of caramel and citrus sweet highlights. The aftertaste gives you a more resiny, rich, and bitter hops presence, with an overall lightness due to the citrus balance and the increased carbonation.

The smell on this is pretty muted, although what's there leans towards the malty side of things. No pine, no citrus, and no hops if any. The only real let down in the beer. The taste is so balanced. Perhaps one of the MOST balanced I've had. None of the hops, malt, or pine stick out more than the other. Instead, they all come together in a harmony rarely seen in a beer, much less an IPA. This is a clean beer that I could easily put away several of. Which leads us to, the mouthfeel. Very clean and crisp again. There's a decent amount of bitterness here, with the hops finally making an appearance. This is the latest in a beer I've ever seen hops take prominence. It's very unique. The taste doesn't linger too long, but there's a little bit of a citrus tinge left at the end too. Another first. Overall, this is a fabulous beer.

The alcohol is there but I was really shocked when I read the abv here because it doesn't have much of that in the taste really at all. I enjoyed this but it is not your normal double, very balanced with malt and comes off more like a strong ale since it is not as hop forward, but I did enjoy it for what it is so Kudos to Sixpoint for that.","Slatetank","Mar 09, 2012"

The flavors begin very sweet and malty before turning very bitter and dry. The bitterness follows into the aftertaste and lingers a tad too long. It's just ok.

A firm even half an inch of dark tannish/light brown foam that has ok retention and leaves some spots on the glass. A bit of haze to the liquid. Smell is assertively dry hopped with some piney scent that is pungent. Some grain and grass comes up with a big caramel malt build. Just as sweet smelling as it is hoppy. Take a whiff, it's big. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. Taste is very big, very hoppy, very malty and very big. Piney dank resinous hop blast that builds into a sweet taste in the middle followed by a shot of hot alcohol. Insanely bitter. Earthy and piney hoppings, not tropical like most. East coast for sure. This has the makings to go a year and become one of those old hoppy barleywines that I've heard of. The body is there.

Some swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose begins with a significant piny, resinous hops presence followed by floral notes and finishing with citrus aromas. Taste is somewhat consistent with the nose; however, there is a strange spiciness embedded in the flavor profile that reminds me a bit of Asian cuisine - soy sauce, brown sugar and perhaps tarragon. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an oily texture and an even carbonation that falls just short of lively.

Two fingers of cream colored foam swirl together atop the beer, before slowing creeping downwards.The lacing left behind is very nice, nearly sheetlike. There is definitely a bit of caramel in the nose, but overall the aroma reeks of dank pine hops, with a slight herbal edge. The caramel base is a bit more prominent in the flavor profile, before an aggressive bitter bite makes itself known. The pine and almost minty herb hop finish is potent, but the effect is just a little too blunted for my taste by the prodigious (for the style) caramel backbone. The body here is a little too full for my taste, I prefer my double IPAs to be a little more dried out. The carbonation, while not bad, could also stand to be a little more active. Resin's not a bad beer by any stretch, and I always appreciate a hop bomb that does something outside of the usual citrus/grapefruit, but Sixpoint's got a beer here that is shaded a little bit too much towards imperial amber to be considered a great DIPA.","axeman9182","Feb 09, 2012"
