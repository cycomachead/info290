"Overall, another impressive beer by the boys from Munster. This one is almost as good as Cimmerian sabertooth Berzerker, which I gave a 5. It all comes down to personal taste, of course, but this one was just a little too muted for me to consider it worthy of a 5. Still an awesome, awesome, awesome beer. I enjoyed every sip."

"Hazy amber with an aggressively hoppy nose. Lots of citrus and pine, with an unfortunate underlying staleness. A big beer with big flavor. I do wonder about the freshness? Syrupy sweet malt with candied lemon and a piney bitter finish that's - on the whole - rather balanced just goes on and on. A great beer, but not a great DIPA."

"O: Excellent brew.  Found this one in Chicago at Whole Foods, brought it to China where I am now drinking it on March 10th, 2015.  It just keeps getting better as you drink it.  It has all the right qualities for this style, yet is smooth and amazingly well crafted."
"Hraeat aro.a and smooth drinking.  I can see ordering another...."
""
"Bomber poured into plastic cup. Hazy orange with some foam and lots of lacing. Aroma is citrus hop, pine, and a hint of caramel malt sweetness. Taste is similar with brief biscuit and caramel sweetness replaced quickly by pine resin and citrus rind bitterness. Oily mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, dry finish."

"great double ipa"
""
""

"Mine might have been old. No bottle date. I got a lot of pine and lemon/lime cleaning solution in both the flavor and aroma. I'd try it again and search for a fresh bottle."

"Excellent imperial ipa. Good flavor. Not too stringy or too bitter."

"Crystal clear gold, laced white foam. Danky and sticky, overripe loupe and tangelo, wet malt. Oofa. Sticky Imperial with bitter and booze"

"OVERALL:  This is a real treat to be able to drink this fresh out here in Colorado.  That is part of what I miss about living in Chicago; fresh FFF.  Overall, this is an excellent Double IPA, I still think I prefer Dreadnaught though."

"O - The wolf has got me in it's grip. Tons of aroma. Tons of flavor. This is easily one of the most balanced, and unique DIPAs I have ever had. Hard to believe how easy drinking this beer is with all of the flavors. No hype here folks. Get it! GET IT NOW! Wait… I mean it's terrible. Especially the stuff that comes to Ohio."

"Light hazy orange straw body. Citrus smell. Very hoppy. Just finished an Apocalypse Cow, and this is much lighter, but still hoppier tasting. Grapefruit and citrus taste. Good stuff"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I must admit, I was expecting more of a bitter hop bomb than what actually ended up in the glass.  Dare I say, this is almost like an English-style DIPA with its sturdy malt presence and subtle hop usage."
""
""
""
"O - Such a fantastic beer - a true standout from 3 Floyds. The ripeness of the hop flavors and the buoyancy of the light mouthfeel makes this beer stand out from the ever-growing pack of DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This comes off as a single IPA Vs. an IIPA. The flavor is a little let down. For this being an IIPA, nothing really screams I'm great. Still worth a try."

"Without doubt one of the finest beers I've had the pleasure to drink. Amazing aromas and flavours, and so perfectly balanced that it's in a very select few beers I've tasted that is outstanding at any temperature."
""
""
""
"O – Not my first time drinking this beer so I came in knowing what to expect: tons of flavor, tons of hops, great smells, great taste.  This is such a fantastic beer that I hate to drink what I’ve got, knowing it will be awhile before I get my hands on more."

"Among their IIPA's, I certainly prefer the Dreadnaught since it's juicier and more fruit centered in its hop selection...but this one certainly isn't bad."
""
"This is probably my favorite beer by Three Floyds. I picked up a bomber for $10 at my local liquor store, but man it was worth it. My first sip of this beer immediately reminded me of the north woods of Wisconsin. The pine aroma... I was literally drinking pine sap from a tree, but in a very delicious bittery way. If you like a beer with 100+ IBUs then here you go!"

"#ThreeFloyds #ArticPanzerWolf is an American Imperial IPA that puts a deep bright orange hue, lots of sediment~ Im beginning to wonder if mine is a bit old as it has heavy yeasty sediment floating, so perhaps this review should be taking with a grain of salt~ Aroma starts off very citrus, also a heavy smell of 'right before it rains' a lit of earthiness.. Honestly it smells like dirt~ Almost a bit bitter I feel like I have to end this #Breview as this one still taste good, I don't think it is tasting the way 3F's intended it (If so, it was less than Impressive)~ Overall: Incomplete (Stay tuned for a revisit)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So far I am 4 for 5 on Three Floyd products. The three mentioned here plus Robert the Bruce are all outstanding. Only Alpha King disappointed me. Probably because I have totally changed my palate the last few years. I will definitely buy this again when I see it. IF I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not the most unique IPA I've tried, but still pretty unusual, and very enjoyable."

"O: it's scary how crushable this beer is; the ABV is completely hidden. Fantastic aroma, nice mouthfeel, and great flavor."
""
""
""
"O - Perhaps not quite as brutal as the name and artwork suggest, but still a strong, uncompromising foray into the heart of hopness. A delicious DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A solid offering, I prefer Dreadnaught but wouldn't pass this up if given the opportunity to try it again"

"Pours a slightly hazy, honey gold body (color borders on orange); thick creamy head. Aroma is of apricots and sweet hops. Flavor has dried apricots, peach pits, sweet clementines and a nice prolonged flavor. Prickly, strong body and a nice dry feel. Stands out from other DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great cloudy golden orange color when poured. Very fragrant citrus nose. Good pine and citrus flavor upon first couple drinks. Slightly bitter after taste. As it sits and warms a bit I get a lot more of the pine taste. Overall very solid ipa and another winner from FFF."

"Overall: not bad for the style, but I do prefer other beers from FFF"
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I enjoyed this offering. I felt the nose could have been more pronounced but this bottle is about 8 weeks old so it could have mellowed. It can't shine Dreadnaught's shoes but it's hardly offensive either. I'd gladly drink this one again."
"O-Pretty amazing. Maybe not as memorable as some of their other beers I have recently tried but it's still a monster and I have almost no complaints."
""
"Three Floyds makes some amazing hoppy beers, but Arctic Panzer Wolf is definitely not amongst the best of them. With a rich caramel maltiness on the front end and some intense, citrusy bitterness on the finish, this beer reminds me of what used to be considered an East Coast style double IPA."

"i have to confess that this was not the freshest bottle, in fact, im sure past its prime. in a gross cellaring error by close friend and loyal BA claystation, this bottle was forgotten for about seven months, so im sure its not drinking as well as it might have been back then. let that be a preface for the rest of this review, and i will make sure to revisit this if i am lucky enough to have a fresh one some day down the road. odd pour here, mango orange tinted golden bronze color with a ton of yeast floaties in here, like a mikkeller barleywine or something, its that prominent. heady too, over an inch of white, and lasting. the nose is tropical fruit all the way, passion fruit and papaya, but im sure this has faded some too, as there is virtually no bitterness but instead a thick malty sweetness that isnt all the way awesome. the flavor is a lot like the nose, thick and sticky hops in the fruit family, but im imagining what they could have been, not really focusing on what they are. some citrus too as it finishes, and again the malt sweetness. a little more body than necessary, but a really well hidden alcohol content and a cool use of hops. not my favorite from three floyds, but i will reserve judgement on whether or not it is worth the hype until i have a fresh one."

"Taste starts sweet with a bit of bitterness, citrus in the middle with more bitterness, and bitterness with alcohol through the close. Somehow though, bitterness is in control, not bitter simply for bitter's sake. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is good for an DIPA. Nice brew, for sure."

"Overall 4.0: Excellent IPA. What really sets it apart for me is the strange -yet delicious-- taste of green tea in the middle of the palate. This is a big beer and there is no hint of the big ABV. Recommended."

"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation of medium to medium high levels, giving the beer a slightly fizzy (1/5) and then very foamy (4/5) mouthfeel. Ethanol is easily felt and accentuated from the carbonation, appearing on the tongue, back of throat, and in the nostrils. A bit less carbonation would actually suit this beer better, making it more of a moderate sipper than a fizzy ale. Closes dry, with heavy lingering stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely better than Dreadnaught. It brings the hops to your mouth. Definitely not balanced, but that's Three Floyds for you. A fantastic DIPA, no doubt."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I was worried this was going to be an over-the-top one-dimensional hop bomb after enjoying Dreadnaught--what could to that one? Although heretical, on a side by side, I liked it better than its better known brother. Pushes the edge and stops just right. Three more just arrived. Cheers"

"O - A DIPA for bitter-minded hop-heads."
""
""
""
""
"Golden amber colored crystal clear beer with a nice finger of head that leaves good lacing. The smell is grapefruit, pine, citrus zest, grass, malt in the background. Also pineapple, papaya, and mango. The taste is very bitter, with grapefruit, grass, pine, citrus zest and lemon-lime. The mouth feel is light-med but w a tongue numbing bitterness. Alc is covered. Overall this is an amazing dipa, and would be similar to palate wrecker imho."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another benchmark DIPA from 3Fs. Lots of concentrated, fruity, citrusy hop aromas with a dangerous drinkability for the ABV. A must try for any craft beer fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One more grain of sugar, drop of alcohol, etc., and this brew would be over the edge. It happens to stop on the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to smchenry75 for the trade! Pours a brilliant orange with a thin, quickly dissipating white head that leaves decent lacing. Amazing nose - pine, citrus and a hint of dank. The taste showcases a great malt backbone which perfectly balances the potent hop bitterness, lots of citrus and resinous pine. Finishes dry and bracingly bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely well crafted double IPA. I am very impressed by FFF, who have given us two world-class double IPAs in this and Dreadnaught."

"Poured a cloudy medium gold, with about one finger of short-lived head. Left lacing. I noticed the pine and apricot in the aroma, as well as the taste. Less so the white wine and marmalade. It was reminiscent of a dry white in its texture and mouth feel, so that might be the reference. Has significant carbonation, which makes it a slower drinker, not at all bad given its ABV. A great Imperial IPA."

"O - I was able to share this deuce deuce with some friends and we all really enoyed it. Most definitely worth a try."

"No tongue searing or burning alcohol. A new (to me at least) type of DIPA, its hoppy but also delicate, airy and supple. A DIP with class and refinement."

"Overall: Fresh, this is one of the very best Imperial IPAs out there. If it has been on the shelf for a few weeks, it's still as strong as anything else... just loses a little kick. As with any Three Floyd's beers, this is top notch."
""
"O: Great brew, and a great brewery. 3Floyd's gets a lot of craft-brew love, and they deserve it. Not my favorite 3F brew, but still a great DIPA. I just wish they distributed to my area :-("
""
""
""
""
""
"I like that this isn't the(run of the mill)DIPA. There's a mix of flavors that make this stand out among it's peers. Try to get your hands on one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"Rather enjoyed it and would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, although lately I've been more in the mood for citrusey/fruity IPAs/DIPAs, this is a great one if you have a grudge against your palate. Piney, bitter, drinkable for 9% although the flavor makes it a sipper anyway...a nice big, bitter DIPA."

"Overall: This is a very good IPA fro Three Floyds. Definitely on the bitter side (one of the bitterest I've had, personally). Destroys your tongue, though that's not a bad thing at all. One of the easier Three Floyds brews to find if their beer is available in your area. It can be a little on the expensive side at $12 per bomber in this area. Though I prefer some of their other IIPAs generally, this is a very enjoyable beer. Highly recommended if you're seeking a palate wrecker."

"Ever so slightly hazy amber with a head of moderate size and durability that leaves some sticky lacing. Pungent hoppy aroma with a more refined and palatable taste. More sweet malt here than the nose suggests (a good thing): so much that the huge hop hit finishes with only moderate bitterness. Smooth with partially hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
"M: Not extremely smooth, but this ale has a crisp finish - yin and yang going on. I feel this is an excellent DIPA, but a little more on the pine/resin side compared to other DIPAs made by the great 3F. I enjoy this on tap more than the bottle, but I will usually grab when the chance affords itself."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice, drinkable DIPA; not overly complex, but very tasty and satisfying!"
""
""
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into signature teku glass, no bottle dating. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Moderate soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA as expected. Big hop flavor complexity and balance with moderate malts; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Medium plus bodied, lighter carbonation. Warming and smooth, rich and delicious. I'm pissed I only got one bomber. Damn me!"
""
"Overall: great beer. Makes a reach for my favorite iipa (alchemy hour) but falls short, not by too much. The toasted malt character works well with the complexity of the hops."

"Even if you're just looking for a beer to """warm you up", this would be a very good option... but not only do I like this more than Dreadnaught (by quite a margin, in fact), but this is the third best beer I've ever tasted. I'd really like to try Dreadnaught again to see if I really like this one that much more, but WOW. Very few can match this IIPA by Three Floyds."

"Overall - A very good Imperial IPA, though it doesn't do much to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack. It's a beer I'd buy if it were on California shelves, but not necessarily one I'd trade for again, as comparable DIPAs are readily available."

"O- This was my first three floyds and I can't wait to trade for some more. This is a outstanding IIPA. Great balance of flavors. It has the bitterness for the hopheads but I think would go over really well with people that dont usually drink big IPAs. Good stuff."
""

"The beer pours a cloudy, dull golden orange with mild white sediment and an inch of sticky off-white head that provides exceptional lacing. The nose is also exceptionally citrusy with notes of fresh squeezed oranges, candied orange peels, and grapefruit. The taste is spot on with a potent candy sweetness upfront followed by a slightly dry grapefruity bitterness. The mouthfeel is elegant - sweet malt, slight yeast, citrus hops, masked alcohol, and a semi-dry, modestly bitter finish. This beer deserves a world class rating, especially considering drinkability and price."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not really into IPA's. But this one is very good. It has that usual grassy taste that most IPA's seem to shoot for. But this one tastes like it's a couple cuts above the norm. It's very flavorful, floral and sweet. I didn't have the cap off completely, I just let some air out and you could immediately smell its fruity bouquet. If you like IPA's you'll probably love this."
""
"O - Fantastic! Enjoyed this one more than Dreadnaught (although I really loved them both). I'm thinking of this as a 2 hearted ale on steriods (big time)."
""
""
"Overall-very happy with this purchase, it's a little pricey for a bomber but worth it. Three Floyd's just kill it with these IPA's. this one seems to be around Ohio the most, every time I see it I will most likely purchase from here on out. Great mix of sweet and bitter. 4.5"
"Overall: I love FFF IPAs, because they have a pretty distinct hop profile that is very different and distinct at the same time. This beer is no different; another great offering that I'd love to have again."

"Beautiful hazy, golden-orange with a big, fluffy, soapy, sticky bright white head that leaves behind tons of lacing and great retention. Gorgeous DIPA. The nose explodes with massive hop aromas. Citrus such as fresh grapefruit, orange, and apricot. This is a serious fresh hop, pine, and citrus bomb. Great body. Seriously. So creamy and smooth. Feels fantastic and the flavors are absurd. This has so much complexity for being such a hop bomb. The IBUs are off the charts but the hop character is so enjoyable. There some booze, some really dry qualities, and a bit of cloying sweetness, but outside of that it's a flawless beer. Wow."

"This is an intense yet solid offering from FFF. Can't say I loved it as much as their other stuff that I got to try, but it's a strong, full bodied hop-filled and fruity experience that should definitely be tried. At the price of $13 a bomber everywhere, it's debatable whether this is worth it, but fans of DIPAs and tripels must try this thing at least once, in my view."
""
""
"O - I get the concept here from FFF. It's not replacing Dreadnaught as Dreadnaught is for me significantly better and tastier. It's not brought in to replace Apocalypse Cow as its not a seasonal. It's just a world class bunch of brewers saying hey we can make as Manu of these as we want to, we can make as many as we want and keep all of them world class, we can sell every one of them, and there isn't a damn thing you can do to compete with us. This rounds out a solid family of FFF and I'm a believer of these guys. Ill buy Dreadnaught every single time over panzer wolf and I'll always look for apocalypse cow in summer, but there are times when I drink up all the Dreadnaught before the next months delivery. What will I do? I'll buy this because it's a solid DIPA. I mean it's still good stuff. It's not Dreadnaught, but hey! It wasn't intended to be. It wasnt intended to be better than dready. It was crafted to give you a bite when you really need it. Hence the snarling wolf on the label. We will all drink our Dreadnaught, but we will need a bit more bite a few times of year."

"O - a great IPA. For whatever reason, I want to dislike 3floyds, but its undeniable that their beers are great. You can see some of the bloodlines of zombie dust here, but really packs a bitterness whallop that ZD doesnt have. Overall, a great IPA."
""
""
"I'm not getting the high IBU count here. Took this on the advice that this is close to Zombie Dust...quite not true. Not seeing the hype here, matter of fact I'm disappointed. Now I know why this is always on the shelves throughout Chicagoland. Dreadnaught is better at a lower price. This is not a juicy grapefruit, but rather a pine cone bomb in an onion patch. One good thing though--it is drinkable. This reminds me of Stone's Enjoy By brews. I will not be buying this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a rich orange with a slight half finger of white head that quickly dissipated leaving slight lacing. Scents of citrus hops, malt, slight white grape and hints of molasses. Flavor begins with a hit of dry malt, overwhelmed by bitter hops, moves into grapefruit pith and citrus hops and finishes dry with a bitter grapefruit pith flavor and aftertaste. There is a slight sweetness from the malt but it is overwhelmed by the hops. Definitely a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, quite easy to drink. It hides it's alcohol fairly well. A very good hop bomb IIPA. An even more hop forward Hop Stoopid, beyond Hopslam, Ruination, Hoptimum and 90 Minute and it even comes across as more hop forward than 120 Minute, as it lacks much of the sweetness. A great hophead DIPA, I am glad I finally got to try it. Just a shame about that distribution."

"Decent short lived off white head with some lace. Golden with lots of haze and particulates. Aroma of baked bread, passion fruit, with a bit of cattiness. Strong carbonation with a medium body. Earthy/herbal hops with a fair amount of sugary sweetness. Strong bitter finish with a noticeable amount of alcohol."
""
"This is my first APW, thanks to mpayne5! Wow! I am loving this stuff! It feels like the wolf on the label just bit my face off. This stuff is not for beginners! A true citrus-hop bomb indeed. Pours a hazy orange-copper, with a thin creamy head that dissipates fairly quickly which is fine with me. Where do I start with the aroma? The only way I can describe it, is like freshly sliced fruit salad sitting on a bed of pine needles. I gotta say, this is one of the best smelling DIPA's I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. To say this beer is a hop-bomb is an understatement! Big hop's way up front, yet sweet and malty on the finish, and it tickles my nose like champagne. I can't say enough good things about this beer, If you see it, get it! If you don't get it in your area, trade! I know I am gonna, again!"

Taste is also buttery, lots of pine, some orange, some mango some apricot, thick texture with a nice bitter bite. I'm a big fan of all things Floyd's but I would rather grab a dreadnaught any day, this is a great beer, very intense thick buttery hop profile. This been lives up to the name, worth a try for sure"

It wasn't hugely hopped, but there was enough hops in this beer to keep you on your toes. This wasn't a beer that relied on a cool label. The beer was just as cool as the kick ass label."
"O - Really fantastic beer actually. Its simply really pleasing. It satisfies my thirst for an IPA's bitterness but doesn't stick around too long. Each taste is incredibly consistent. The smooth feel works well with the caramel. Fantastic beer."

"Overall: This is a delicious brew and right in my wheelhouse as of late as it seems I can’t get enough of these citrus hops dominant I.P.A’s and double I.P.A’s…the flavor is fantastic, though it doesn’t exude exuberant fresh taste that say a Stone Drink By or an Avery DuganA do...there’s very little alcohol taste for the higher ABV, allowing the beer ingredients to speak for themselves…the only downfall with this brew is the pricetag…at $11.99/22oz (though I bought this one for $10 at the brewery), it’s a bit pricey and not something I would normally spend for less than two beers…is it worth $12? maybe…but what I do have here is excellent and I’m enjoying it thoroughly…if you are looking for something chicagoland specific or are near the brewpub or don’t mind spending money on beer, then this brew is worthy of the money…if, like me, you are typically a baller on a budget, then you can pass on this one and choose something like a Three Floyds Zombie Dust 6-pack or even a Widmer Bros Nelson Imperial I.P.A. to excite your taste buds…(4/5)"
""

"From notes, 7/29/11. Pours a bright, light gold with a big head. Dry start with some simple malt sweetness in the finish. Bitterness is strong, about an 8/10. Huge citric-pine aroma with just a touch of light maltiness. A touch of herbal and light stone fruit flavors, as well. West Coast in styling but still stands apart from any other DIPA that I’ve tried. Smooth and fairly light on the palate. No noticeable booziness. Good stuff."

"I'm new to IPAs and up 'til now my favorites have been Southern Tier's 2XIPA and Three Floyds' Dreadnaught. But TF's Arctic Panzer Wolf has just blown my mind! It has tons of hops but in a flavorful way. It's a bit on the pricey side too (I paid $11.99 for a pint bottle at the Louisville Beer Store). But I honestly hope that someone in town gets this on tap soon! Great beer!!"

"Pours cloudy golden/light orange with a small quickly receding head. Aroma of lemon, grapefruit, tangerines. Definitely strong, with slick mouthfeel. Not sure how fresh the bottle is (no date), but not much punch in terms of bitter hops. A bit of tangerine and apricot, with a lingering grapefruit tartness. Not super impressed here, but not a bad beer. Something about this style of IPA just doesn't do it for me. The bitter dryness cuts into the juicy citrus in a way that I don't dig. Also gave me a headache for some reason, so maybe that was taking away from things."

"Pours a crystal clear, classic golden color with an egg shell/vanilla colored, fat, foamy head. Hop vegetable matter is noted floating after the second half of the bomber is poured. The head retention is better than average. I stick my nose in and, hello grapefruit! Lovely, lovely grapefruit. Mouthfeel is nearly as lovely. Soft, full, wet, but not juicy. The hop hotness cuts what otherwise might express as juiciness. Perfect amount of carbonation scrub on the back of the tongue. Megagrapefruit, some pine around the edges of the tongue, light sulfur, and a bit of onion. This beer's my hero. One of the best from FFF, in my opinion."

"The beer poured a hazy orange body with a nice, perhaps slightly off-white head, maybe 1 finger, but settled into a thin cap that lasted pretty much throughout the beer. The beer gave off a big hoppy aroma, citrus and pine. The alcohol was noticeable as the beer warmed. The taste was very good, again, big citrus and pine hops, but also some malty goodness in there and I think that I detected a hint of pepper as well. The beer had a heavy feel to it, sticky and a little like syrup. Overall, I would say that this is a really good DIPA, perhaps I would have liked it more, but I am really over the style."

"The color of this IPA is amongst the ugliest I've ever seen. I'd say it was a Hefe by the looks of it but one sniff and you know this is all hops. The scent is of pungent pine, almost too strong for my liking. The taste is truly what matters and thats where this IPA truly succeeds. The hops are subtle but noticeable. It's truly amazing how you can have an ale so overwhelming in scent but so subtle and tasteful at the same time. I absolutely enjoyed this and highly recommend it."

"O I wish I had another!"

"O Is it fresh? Must know. A very good DIPA but way sweeter and juicier than I usually go for."
""
"This looks clear and clean with a bright copper/amber color and a healthy white cover with lots of lacing. The aroma brings a malty pine hop with a light floral complement. Nice. The flavor offers a beautifully blended grass-pine hop bitterness with oak caramel and some alcohol presence. Nutty and a bit leafy. Medium bodied with a soft, well blended carbonation. Very smooth stuff with a little kick. Though it's quite hoppy as I typically like this style to be, there's a bit more alcohol than I like to taste. Nice enough."
"O - Good, it stays bitter, but the booziness is just too strong, not hidden well for a 9%er."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very well done FFF, it really is like FFF to have a DIPA that just kicks your ass with hops. I know this isn't for everyone, but if you are a hop head that likes a ridiculous amount of hops in a beer then look no further."

"Arctic Panzer enjoyed on-tap, served in a goblet. The appearance is amber, golden notes with a small white head. Its` nose has citrus, malts and a nice sweetness to it. A good amount of hops, but certainly nothing overboard. Mouthfeel is towards heavy, bitterness in the finish. It is a pleasant aftertaste, though one that I found was helpful to have bread nearby to enjoy with. A very good DIPA from FFF."
"O: Overall, this is a very good imperial. I was more than impressed with it. It was a little pricey, about 10.99 for a 24 oz bottle from the local beer store, but it is worth it."
""
""
""
"O: I've been really building this beer up and don't get me wrong, it is an amazing beer, however I feel like it fills the void between an IPA and a DIPA, 3 years ago this would be an awesome DIPA, but now with so many newcomers that are bigger, stronger, and just loaded with flavor this comes off as a hoppy somewhat-one dimensional very strong IPA...but that one dimension it has is amazing"
""
"O:  Id say the best thing about this beer is how unique it is for the style, especially  the aroma and to a certain degree  the flavor as well.  Overall though, in a style that procudes a lot of home runs, this one is pretty middle of the road in my book, but I give it bonus points for its unique qualities.  I am glad I was able to try this, but in the future if I make an effort to obtain a FFF DIPA its most certainly going to be Dreadnaught.  Definitely worth trying though, if you are a fan of the style.  "

"Great mouthfeel as well- light, closer to medium body, moderate carbonation, a great does of resin. I really like this one- it's fresh, and it definitely lives up to the Three Floyds reputation. Try it if you love hops and see it!"
"O: One hell of a DIPA; I enjoyed it more than their beloved Dreadnaught. I have a feeling that it wasn’t perfectly fresh, but I definitely liked what I got – and one of the signs of a great beer is that it can stand the test of a few weeks’ time. Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Totally different than Dreadnaught, but just as good."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the aroma. There was such a great bright hop, and a beautiful mix of sugary sweetness. This is why the first few sips were so surprising in their bitterness. With warmth, however, the spice and hops really cool down, and come to a supreme balance with the malts, for a great representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - FFF seldom disappoints and often hits a Homerun...APW is certainly in the latter category. This is a top notch DIPA, maybe not the best but certainly worth mentioning. I didnt think it would be possible but I prefer it over Dreadnaught to be perfectly honest. Great beer."
""

I definitely recommend trying a bottle if you are a true Hop-Head."

I particularly liked the aftertaste, kind of a lingering bitterness in the background. The alcohol kind of sneaks up on you because you can't really taste it."
""
"Medium to slightly full-bodied for the style, with medium carbonation. Somewhat hefty mouthfeel seems appropriate given the huge and bold hoppiness. As others have said, this isn’t the most drinkable beer; it’s both alcoholically strong and bordering on the extreme (well past for some) in terms of hopping. Puts me in mind of Surly’s Abrasive, which I think is perhaps a slightly better beer."
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a blast of sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes countered by faint earthy dryness.  Excellently balances with dank earthy pine notes and some pale biscuit malt.  Never comes across to bitter or too sweet.  Very flavorful and easy to drink."

"Hazy golden yellow with a couple fingers of big bubbles. Good retention and solid lacing. Tons of tropical notes in the nose, some sweet jammy notes. Touch of pine, but this is bright in a very fruity way. Taste has more jammy notes (marmalade as the label suggests, and this is bang on I think). More tropical fruits, resin and a bittersweet finish. Definitely unique in hop profile and malt character. Medium full body, medium low carb and lightly drying. Certainly a unique DIPA in a variety of ways, wish I knew how fresh this was."

"A most impressive Imperial IPA, but not as exceptional as the Dreadnaught. Unique in that it doesn't have the same kind of profile as the many Double IPAs I have had. Started off smelling a bit like Hopslam and tasted like a lighter version. Not resinous or dank, the way I like 'em, but a prime dry example of the style. 4.0"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good DIPA, nothing mindblowing. I'd like to try fresher versions of this."
""
"O: Different. Very good but not quite at the level of Three Floyds Dreadnaught."
""
""
"It also kind of reminds me of running through a lush meadow without any insects."
""
"O: My first Three Floyds. Impressed with it, but I'm not really into malty IPAs. Probably the most brutal name for a beer though!"
""
"More interesting hop notes come forward as the beer warms...a good DIPA to be sure, really smooth and grapefruity. Not as predatory or grim as expected but it will do."

"O - A great DIPA, glad I got myself a bottle of this however I prefer Dreadnaught."
""
""

"Mouthfeel is dry and somewhat sticky, overall, this is a pretty good beer."
"I've had Panzer Wolf before, and this one was probably not as good. I've learned with DIPA's, drink them as fresh as possible...and I may have let this one sit a few weeks too long. Still a great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - To me this drinks alot more like an IPA vs. a DIPA, which is a pleasant surprise at 9% ABV. Puckering, drying and refreshing - not heavy or sweet at all in my opinion. An excellent DIPA for those who prefer less sweetness and more of the bold, bitter and puckering hop characteristics. A palate destroyer for sure, but in a very good way :)"
"And...as usual with 3F...great bottle artwork."
""
""
"Pretty sure I prefer this to Dreadnaught. I've had this brew a few times before, though none were as fresh as this bottle. Do not sit on your bottles: drink this stuff ASAP!"
"Pours a deep orange color with a huge 3 finger foamy head from the tap. Nice looking pour. Smell is full of fruits and hops. Very big aromas. Taste is amazing. Loads of hops with nice floral notes. No alcohol on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is so good. Well done."
"Incredibly hoppy, right from the get-go you can smell the intense aroma of grassy citrusy hops the second you pop the cap off of the bottle. Pours a rich golden yellow with a fat fluffy head. Very well carbonated. The hops completely take over your taste buds and assault your pallet. Truly this beer is made for hop heads. Very intensely grassy and citrusy tasting. Unless you really like hops this beer is probably not for you. Still it is quite amazing, although I prefer Dreadnaught. This is a beer that you would really have to be in the mood for, you wouldn't want to pop this for just any particular reason. Another great selection from three Floyds."

"Three Floyds never fails to impress. APW is extremely clean, well-rounded and refreshing. It's simple yet effective. A very solid attempt at the style."
""
"22 oz bomber into a duvel tulip. Pours a hazy orange yellow with a 2 inch thick white head that shrinks to a finger with nice laxing. Aroma is strong pine with a light breadiness. Flavor is pine resin, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, and a mild bready caramel malt. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, sticky and dry. One of my favorite dipa's."
""
"O: A solid, but not great offering from 3 Floyds. Can't complain though as my local grocery store had this priced at $7.99. Clearly a mistake as it is $10 at the brewery but who am I to complain."
""
""
""
""
"The bittering hops feel almost leafy and stand out through the finish. The roof of my mouth feels ate up with bitterness."

"O: Very good Imperial IPA, I think the label prepares you for what's to come, would recommend, have had before and will drink again"
"O - What a hoppy beer! If you prefer a balanced beer then this is not it. Scorch with hops is the name of the game here."

"O: I'd say we've got a winner. One badass beer with a hell of a name, and the flavor, aroma, and appearance to match it. I would really like to get my hands on another bottle of this or try it on tap."
"overall, this is a nice recipe from the three. it has some strength that gives the drinker a nice glow and allows feelings of love and appreciation for the beer to flourish. it is absolutely an imperial recipe, but the balance is striking. i had this on tap at the brewery and made sure i grabbed a bomber to enjoy later. that time is now and i have a smile on my face. time for some pizza from Mr. Scribs. life is so darn good right now..."

"Pours a cloudy copper orange color with a minor head but great lacing. Has a mild scent of bitter hops. Rather bold and flavorful, even though it was rather hoppy it wasn't overly bitter. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. Nicely served in proper glassware and temperature I might add."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O: A great IIPA that I'm very glad to have had the chance to sample. Well I put down a whole bomber so not really a sample but I would gladly trade for this one again. A very worthy beer and I'm looking forward to trying more FFF offerings in the future..."
""
"According to my notes, """This is so aggressive - like a wolf biting you in the balls.""" As I have never had this experience, I do not know if this is a valid comparison. Regardless, this is absurdly aggressive. And definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"O - A really nice DIPA, and a nice contrast to Dreadnaught, which I prefer to this slightly."
"O - I really like this beer, but I do prefer Dreadnaught. I've been drinking a lot of east coast and/or citrus IPAs lately, and this really brought me back to the lovely world of pine and floral hops. I do prefer Dreadnaught to this because of the great malt backbone, hop profile, and lower alcohol presence, but it is yet another fantastic FFF brew. I wish more breweries would create 2 contrasting DIPAs that are both excellent in their own respects. Definitely try this if you can, just try Dreadnaught first."
"This is a great beer, much like its Dreadnaught brother. The main differences I feel between this and Dreadnaught is the hop character (citrus vs pine) and the drinkability factor (No noticeable alcohol bite on Dreadnaught.) I love them both and Arctic Panzer is a fine example of the style. Another great beer from FFF."
""
""
"O - definitely wouldn't drink 2 bombers in one shot - feeling pretty buzzed already. very nice robust IIPA though - still to be let down by 3F!"

"22 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy golden-orange color with a slight reddish hue, fluffy white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malt, caramel, orange, pine, spices and peaches. Flavor is sweet, caramel, orange, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium, slick texture and has a bitterness that sticks on the tongue for a while. Very good beer, nice balance for such a largely hopped beer."
"My favorite DIPA from Three Floyds. Terrific body, crisp. Alcohol bite is a little more present here than in Dreadnaught, but the dose of hops in this helps smooth it back out. It doesn't pack the hop aroma that I get from, say, a Hopslam, but the flavor is all there. I've had this on-tap and in bottle, and both are very similar, with on-tap having a little better aroma (I'm thinking I served my own bottle a little colder than in the pub). A bit pricey at the liquor stores, but if you shop around and can get it for a good price, it's hard to beat."

"I aroma on this beer is pungent with hops it smells fantastic! Its body is mostly clearly and very orange. The taste is amazing hops right at the front of the tongue followed by a nice smooth body that drys out and begs you to come back for more. Very enjoyable brew and one I drink often."

"Overall: A good beer for sure but i've been drinking a lot of this style lately. It is neither my favorite nor my least favorite that I've had lately. Very hoppy even for three floyds. Glad I gave it a chance. Will I drink it again? Maybe if I go to the pub and they don't have zombie dust in."
"A pretty good DIPA, but the flavors just don't come together for me. I would happily drink this again, but there are so many better DIPA out there to be sure"
""
""
""
"Overall is extremely high. I love 3F beer and this is now my favorite DIPA from the Floyds."
"O. A good overall DIPA, a little tart and bitter for what I normally like. Usually they are a bit smoother and fruitier, but this lives up to it's aggressive claim. Still a good beer, and different from the norm. I like it and would gladly have it again."
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed but didn't fall in love with it like I thought I would. I really wish it tasted like it smelled. Not a bad choice to seek out but don't waste your time or money if you don't like a malty bill. Thanks to jlpepper13 for the shot at this."
""
""
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is shockingly easy-drinking for a DIPA clocking in at 9% ABV. The body is more like that of a regular IPA, which really allows the drinker to fully experience the flavors while keeping maximum drinkability. The carbonation is a little prickly but does not detract from the flavors and is definitely helpful."

"First off, the label on this beer scares the hell out of me. I think I read Cujo at too early an age. Arctic Panzer Wolf pours a bright orange color, with a nice one finger off white head. Excellent lacing on the side of my snifter. Slightly hazy in appearance. The nose is citrus fruit- pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, as well as pine and earthy hops. It's definitely a smoother more balanced nose than the taste. However, this isn't a balanced beer- and that's fine. It's awesome in what it's going for. The taste is bitter hops, with a malt backbone that smooths it out towards the end. Still, my palate is somewhat wrecked from the hops half way through this bottle, they seem to stick around forever. Big time hops/pine aftertaste. Feel is medium, bitter, and a dry hoppy finish- really dry. I don't really get any of the 9% ABV in this beer at all. Overall, a totally solid and great DIPA. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably my favorite Imperial IPA. fruity but not too sweet, dry but not too bitter. Perfect balance. Hard to believe that they didn't throw fruit right into the fermenter. It's just has so much delicious citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is dry but hop oils counter this. Overall lovely beer, nothing unexpected from 3 Floyds. Highly recommended."
""
"Delicious. This one is one beautiful Imperial IPA!"
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with edging and a few gobs of lace, but sticky alcohol is seen on the glass. The aroma is of peach up front with a citrus kick, then there is huge earthy hop smell. Very inviting aroma nice and bold. The taste follows suit nicely with a peach flavor up front and then a citrus taste. There is a caramel malt backbone and then a massive earthy hop bite. A big ipa taste. The flavor is well blended and at the same time gives the big hop bite hop heads want. The mouthfeel is slightly below moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer. The aroma starts things off on a good note and then the taste follows suit and makes you want more."
""
""
""
"This is fantastic beer, and I liked it just a bit more than Broo Doo, another great one from FFF."
"Overall, the contents of this bottle suggest a decent IPA. I'd give it another go, considering this bottle may be past its prime, but I'd keep expectations low and open myself to the possibility of a pleasant surprise."

"Received in trade from phisigben, thanks for the opportunity! Pours a fairly cloudy golden yellow color with a smallish bubbly white head that displays moderate retention and lace. Smells of pine, resin, and citrus, bits of tropical fruit and grass with barely any malt to be found. Taste is much the same as the aroma. Heavy handed dry hopping with dank baggies, pine needles and grapefruit juice. Leaves a long lingering lemon/grapefruit/citrus on the palette after each sip has hit the gullet. Medium to thick body for an IPA, moderate to low level of carbonation with a sticky resinous bitter mouthfeel. I liked this one, but I found the bitterness a little harsh and heavy on the lemon. It's a great DIPA, but I've had better in the style."
"O: Great beer. It's a little pricey but worth it on a Christmas afternoon."

"O- This is one great DIPA. It is crisp and well hopped. A perfect example of a DIPA for my taste buds. Now only if FFF was here in MN..."

""
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger head that lingers leaving great lacing. Aromas of sweet malts and bitter hops. Taste follows the nose but it's a bit to sweet for a dipa in my opinion. Not the easiest drinking dipa and not in the top of this style. Still not a bad beer it's just not for me"
""
"Very one dimensional DIPA. While I can appreciate the beer, I am less than impressed by it. When you load up on this much piney and pithy bitterness there needs to be something to break things up and contrast a bit. I would reach for Dreadnaught everytime over Arctic Panzer Wolf."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This brew pours a lot more yellow than I would have ever guessed. A nice 1""" white frothy head settles nicely and laces the glass beautifully. Smells good, lots of piney flavor, and a touch of orange rind citrus smell. I definitely get the marmalade flavor in the taste. This is a medium bodied ale with mild carbonation. Just another terrific beer from 3 Floyds. Every time I have one of their beers, it makes me wish I was back in Munster."
"Overall, a very nice DIPA from a fantastic brewery!"
"D - Very good beer; to be enjoyed by those who appreciate pure hop explosions; great balance of roasted caramel malt taste and hop meltdown"

"O - Solid brew, but too one dimensional for me to consider it elite."

"There is a bitter aftertaste, but beforehand you're treated to a citrus body and a bitter initial flavor. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking to delve into the complexities of 3 Floyds' brewing style."
""
"This is a take-no-prisoners approach to hoppy beers. Screaming with citrus/tropical flavors, loaded up with bitterness. For it's size, this one sure goes down easy."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's like getting smacked in the face with a bag full of grapefruits and pine needles. Aggressively bitter and unrelenting. This beer refuses to pull punches and it pays off in the long run. Super tasty, but it's a tongue-wrecker for sure."

"D - solid imperial IPA, didn't blow me away by any means, but i could definitely drink this one again."
"O: I have never understood the concept of a 'balanced' DIPA. This beer goes right for the throat where it should be. Dry and bitter, loads of hop aroma. Only drawbacks really are the light hop flavours and vegetal / earthy note that doesn't pair well."

"A decent IIPA, this isn't quite a one-note wonder, but it is an exercise in brute force hops. There are decent flavors struggling to escape the gravitational well of the hop bitters, and they do, somewhat. However, this is not a sweet DIPA, this is a bitter, bitter, brew. If you enjoy abusing your senses, then don't hesitate to pick this one up."

"O- I love this beer, I just dont love that I payed 12$ for a bomber. This will be a special occasion drinker for me assuming I am able to come by it again. Hop lovers, go and find one of these. One of the best Imperial IPA's I have had the pleasure of drinking. And like I said, its an easy to drink 9% beer, watch out, it caught me off guard"

"D/O: Big and bitter, this DIPA smells very authentic but unfortunately invokes the kitchen sink in the flavor profile. Astringency drags down the latter half, overpowering earlier balance and leaving a frightening impression of high-alpha hop cultivars, all writ large."
""
""
""
"Overall a messy DIPA. The hops don't shine through the malty yeast quality."
"Taste: Sweet and smooth at first, with hop bitterness rising up on the outset. Pithy, raw and righteous bitter fruit flavor. Minor malt, medium body, alcohol rises high. Melds well with the citrus and spice. Hops galore. Love it, love it, love it. Fits this hophead to a tee."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall: This is a nasty mother of a DIPA, much more bitter than most for a beer that is over 9% abv. Much more bitter than Dreadnaught, and not as smooth and creamy. However, this is still a great DIPA when one is in the mood for some punishment."

"Appearance is a golden translucent haze with a sheer white head. Poured Into my nitro milkstout release glass. Smell is that of grassy citrus hops and some breadlike quality. Taste is of citrissy and grassy hops. Mouthful is resinous but drinkable, bitter but not overly so. Overall a great example of a traditional, no frills dipa!"
"A bit strong for my liking. I know that's the style, but this is aggressive. Having said that, this beer never claims to be anything but palate-crushing, so it's something you've got to try."
"O: Solid DIPA, I think I like this one better than their Dreadnaught, but not as much as a Pliny or even a Flower Power."
"This is one of those brews with no middle ground. You’ll either hate it or love it. Those who love bashing, punishing, over-the-top-hopped-brews won’t be able to get enough."
"O: Extremely drinkable. Dangerously drinkable. Just a wonderful mix of hops. A must try."
"I liked this a lot but after a few brews prior to this, I was a little muddled... A nice beer but this one shut me down for the evening..."
"Overall, a really good ADIPA that highlights the bitter without overdoing it. A year ago I had it and didn't like it as much as it was too bitter. But now that my bitter palate is developing, I'm enjoying it much more. Still a little too bitter to love it but still a great beer and eager to try it again in several months. Not avail here in TX - got from Umagum, many thanks as always! Rotation - can't get here so pretty much limited to the occasional bottle which seems to work out great as I'm really growing into this one."
"Overall, an excellent DIPA. Huge hop flavor without overdoing it despite what seems like little malt presence. Had to check the site for the ABV because it wasn't on the bottle and was truly surprised to find that it was 9%. Extremely drinkable for the style and ABV."
"Three Floyds Brewing Co. makes damn IPAs and DIPAs. Arctic Panzer Wolf is definitely a nice addition to the list. I love the aggressive hop flavor and restrained malts. Great formula! The alcohol is just a tad too strong. That’s about its only real shortcoming. Very solid all-around otherwise. Very good stuff."
"Overall - The smell of this one rivals that of the other DIPAs in my top 5. The taste puts it in somewhere in my top 10 DIPAs, possibly even in my top 5. So, overall, this beer is pretty damn good in my opinion. If you like big, in your face hoppy DIPAs, seek this one out when it's nice and fresh! Need I say more? Also, HUGE thanks to Kayn169 for sending me this wonderful beer! It's very much worth trading for. Must say that I enjoyed this one more than I did Dreadnaught. Both good beers though."
"O- I like this DIPA. I don't love it though. It has everything you'd expect from the style with the pungent citrus and herb flavors with the warming finish. FFF makes some of the best hop-forward beers available and this ones no different. I think the abv could be a little more hidden and perhaps a touch more head to the beer, but that's me simply looking for faults in this good beer. I think id prefer their Dreadnaught more often than this though..."
"O: A pretty ho-hum brew that is a slow drinker. It's not bad, but it doesn't stand up to the bar set by the class of the IIPA category."
"Nice beer, but pretty standard for an IIPA. The citrusy hop flavor and aroma is nice though."
"A good beer. The wolf will eye you from behind the trees but does not pounce or go for the jugular."
"O: A decent beer but far from my favorite for the style. The taste lacks for me. One thing that I did enjoy though is that the taste sticks around for a long time on your tongue."
"O: Not a bad beer at all, pretty nice drop for a Friday evening, it just doesn't stack up with some of my other favorites. I really like the amount of resins in this that will not leave the tongue, very awesome. I just would like a little bit more in the nose, and a bit more hop flavor to really make it pop."
"O: Solid beer by Three Floyd's and one that I would gladly drink again. This is a sipper, though"
"Overall - Pungent and flavorful. Better than Dreadnaught, which seems like a malty mess compared to this. It's close to that Pine-Sol flavor, but it misses just enough to make it delicious."
"O- A pretty damn good DIPA, definitely a good choice if you want to get your taste buds nearly seared off with hops. I'm a big fan of aggressively hopped DIPAs, so I love this beer, especially as it offers a bit more complexity than other hophead beers that just try to club you over the head with bitterness. However, it is a bit pricey (I paid $13 for a bomber). Heed the wolf, this beer is not for the timid."
"O: Bravo, Three Floyds. I think the taste section sums it all up."
"Wonderful job 3F!"
"Another fine FFF offering. Exactly what you would expect from this beer, and that isn't a bad thing."
"O: Good"
"I tend to prefer Double/Imperial IPAs that are creamier, rounder, thicker and balanced with more malt. However, if an arctic panzer wolf were to bite you, no doubt it would be sharp and attacking, and that's pretty much what this is...which makes it one for only an experienced hophead. Hop novices would probably hate this, and will want to steer clear. Me, I like it and feel like Three Floyds can't ever do something wrong when they're throwing shitloads of hops into their batches."
"O - Overall, pretty solid. This one didn't blow me away, I would have preferred a better balance with a little less alcohol."
"First beer from Three Floyds and so I was super excited to try this one out. Picked up a bomber of this one and poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice golden color with no has a a decent head. Little head retention but great lacing down the sides. As a hop head I love this one. Flavor is pure citrus greatness. Grapefruit and tangerine hop flavors dominate the scene with little malt showing through but yet well balanced. One of the best IPA's i have ever had and I want another one right now haha. Can't wait to pick one of these up again."
"Mouthfeel and Overall – A very unique brew from Three Floyds. I had Broo Doo two nights ago and thought THAT was special. Arctic Panzerwolf is equally as interesting and worthy of its high marks. I cannot express how happy Three Floyds shipments back to Ohio has made me. Fairly medium-bodied, though the hops can take control at times. This is definitely a good thing in this beer, though."
"Overall Impression- If the artwork doesn't do it for you, FFF's beer sure does! Wow! Such a great 2X IPA, I would like another bottle. Unfortunately, I will have to make another trip up to their BrewPub to get some more bombers. Not as intense as some 2X IPA's but enjoyed thoroughly! Now to enjoy the Apocalypse Cow and see what it has in store for us!"
"I don't always compare brews but although this one is good, I don't like it quite as much as Dreadnaught (at least comparing the same brewery). But, overall, a very good DIPA."
"bigger side of medium bodied, no alcohol noticable, but there is some big hops with some kind of unfamiliar flavors that are not necessarily good, different. huge bitterness. this beer works for me, but at the same time i would pass this up for a lot of other cheaper/ easier to access DIPA's."
"Taste-Pineapple-apricot juiciness, faint malt sweetness followed by a sharp bite of grapefruit-rind bitterness. Alcohol not evident in the onrush of tropical fruit and white grapefruit. Dry finish. Very tasty. Highly recommended for hop-heads."
"About a two finger head, pretty hazy and a deep golden-orange hue. You can see plenty of carbonation. Nose has lots of American hops up front, but some really interesting light citrus, rich fruit (think apricot or peach) and even cream notes in the back. Goes down really smoothly for such a heavily hopped beer; the hops attack the tastebuds on your cheek, but bread and toffee flavors dominate the middle. Medium mouthfeel. Definitely like this one, maybe more than Maharaja."
"22oz bomber purchased from the brewery in Munster, IN. Shared with MrManning. Pours a hazy amber hue with one finger of white foam, a few dots of lacing on the tulip, and some sediment in the body. Smell and taste are apricot, peach, lemon zest, orange rind, fresh cut grass, pineapple, doughy malts, caramel, fruity esters, gooseberry, white grapefruit, pithy and resinous hop bitterness to end. I get a slightly """off""" aroma, almost like industrial cleaner or vinegar, but aside from that the nose is quite enticing, and the flavour is spot on for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is slick, medium bodied, astringent grapefruit bitterness lingers in the bone dry finish. The 100 IBUs are evident on the palate. Overall, this solid Imperial IPA doesn't compare to Dreadnaught, but it's still an impressive example of the style with very enjoyable flavours and aromas. Worth buying IMO."
"Cheers, amigos."
"O: An alright DIPA. It's not bad, but it's very overpriced ($13 for a bomber where I got it) and not nearly worth it. It's too bitter and piny for my tastes."
"Overall: Harsh. Harsh, and harsher again. It's brutal, it takes no prisoners and is an absolutely palate wrecker. An interesting experiment, but hardly a good DIPA."
"Overall, this is a bold hop-forward DIPA. Purposely unbalanced to not distract from the focus. Leans a bit too much to the bitter end for my taste, but great flavors would be welcome by all hop enthusiasts."
"M- Another fantastic IIPA from Three Floyds. This isn't up to par with Dreadnaught, IMO, but not many are. If you have a chance to grab a fresh one of these, do it."
"Overall a solid offering from 3 Floyds. I'm glad they are back in Ohio, and I will defiantly be picking this up on a regular basis."
"Pours light, semi-transparent gold. Nice head retention. Nose is of pine a alcohol. Abrasively bitter at first with a nice hop flavor. Warming alcohol sensation after a few sips, which affects drinkability. Carbonation is light on the tongue. Overall a solid double IPA, but not that easy to come by on the East coast."
"I see a lot of reviews that say this is a well balanced IPA, or that its not too hoppy. The Arctic Panzer wolf that I faced was as much of a one sided hoppy mess, if not moreso than Moylan's hopsickle. There was nothing forgiving about this brew."
"Pale golden color, small head providing alot of lacing. Sweet & fruity malts, pineapple, and tropical hop notes make up the aroma. In the taste, piney and earthy. Nice bitterness, though aggressive. Grapefruit rind. Some noticeable alcohol but not distracting. Dry. Resinous hops. Oily. Medium to full bodied, mild carbonation, good drying hop bite in the finish. Overall, another fine double IPA from 3 Floyds. Really tasty, very solid."
"O - this is not that good. I think Dreadnaught is super good, but this is just pretty mediocre. Feels good, looks good, but the taste really doesnt do too much for ya."
"O- Very solid with plenty of hop bitterness and flavor. I personally could take a bit more balance a bit less alcohol but still quite good."
"Carbonation is perfect for this medium bodied IPA."
"Overall? I would most certainly not be able to stop myself from drinking this until the supply was exhausted or I passed stone cold out. At 9 something ABV the latter would come quickly.."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tropical fruits, lots of pine and citrus zest hops, and some malt. Taste is of tropical fruits, apricot, pine, citrus zest, and some malt on the finish. An assertive hop bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good DIPA with a very nice set of smells and tastes from the hops used."
"Thanks to a buddy for sharing this. Pours a hazy orange into a snifter. Just love how hazy 3F's beers are. Has a big citrusy hop bite up front. You can tell this is a big beer with the high percentage. Doesn't take anything away from the taste or drinkability though. Nice imperial ipa."
"A sipper for sure. The grapefruit is intensely bitter. It's like a bigger Smutty Finest Kind with even more focus on the grapefruit, although I don't know how that's possible."
"O - I would love to compare this with Dreadnaught blindly and see if I can distinguish them apart. Both are solid beers, that have very similar abv, and according to the website the IBU for both are 100."
"Mouthfeel: There is kind of a creamy feel to the beer that makes it easily drinkable for the abv and the hop flavor sticks around deliciously."
"Overall one of my favorite Imperial IPAs. Please sir I'd like some more."
"ABV limits the drinkability (as does the $) but it's a beer you may want to drink till you run out or fall over. Solid hop bomb."
"SkÅL!"
"O - A very nice beer. I'm not a huge fan of IPA's or DIPA's but this does very nice. It came highly recommended and I have to admit it does not disappoint."
"O: I'm really enjoying this beer, in fact I like it much more than FFF Dreadnaught. If this beer was available in my area, I'd keep going back for more."
"O: While I don't like this nearly as much as Dreadnaught, it's still a finely crafted DIPA that is citrus forward and I must say the hop profile does seem a little unique. Easy drinking as hell for 9% ABV."
"O - Great brew. Three Floyds Has magical IPA's. Ive never had a bad one."
"Another solid DIPA from FFF, nothing outstanding, kind of one note on the apricot, as Dreadnaught is with the mango, but still very good. I think a blend of this and Dreadnaught or some some of combination of the recipes could produce a world class DIPA though. So, yeah, get on that Three Floyds."
"O: This one is definitely all about the hops, although it's not too bitter. Because of that fact, it's extremely drinkable and one can have several bottles at one time. Unfortunately, I only had two, so until next time..."
"A pint of this is probably overwhelming and fatiguing, I have to do the extra work and drink the bomber. Not a style I am too keen on but it does deliver what is advertised."
"O - Overall, I'm fairly impressed. A nice easy drink for the ABV. Recommend if you see it, but don't pass Dreadnaught up for this one. It's a couple bucks more in price."
"D - initially i thought it was going to be too bitter but my palate adjusted and i enjoyed it very much; nice combo of aromatic and bittering hops; doesn't overwhelm you in any one area but a very decent drinkable ipa for 9%"
"This is a nice addition to the FFF portfolio. I may like this better than Dreadnaught, which I remember to be a little sweeter. This is an all out bitter assault which is right in this hophead's wheelhouse."
"O: This is a great beer and quite a contrast from Dreadnaught. This is much more mellow but still full-flavored and satisfying. Pretty tame for the wolf imagery, but a great beer nonetheless. I will definitely look for this one again."
"O: It is getting difficult to judge 3Fs beers. Quality is overwhelming with this brewery. I find myself judging 3F beers against the other 3F beers I've had, all while most of them are a step above many other DIPAs. Overall, a very good DIPA but I do enjoy other 3Fs in comparrison."
"O: Not a bad DIPA, but I prefer the others from FFF I think. This one doesn't wow me as much as they do."
"On tap at Comet Cafe Store. Hop aromas.Tasty dipa. Very good hop blend, right there in bitterness, lots of malt. Peachy looking body. A little acidic after a few sips. Very enjoyable citrus orange and tropical fruit, although I would most be pleased by better balance."
"O: Okay I'll admit it, I may be gushing over this beer a bit as i do from time to time. Maybe it's the fact that I only review beers that knock my socks off. Overall a great well rounded beer that once again I am saddened that I can't get on the shelves here in Vegas."
"Realizing the high standard that Three Floyds has set for itself, it is hard to have a winner every time. This is certainly not up to their standard."
"Hop bitterness right up front. Citrus and pine flavors dominate. Big notes of pine sap, clementine orange, grapefruit, and some peppery spiciness. Orange creamsicle malt, with some boozy pineapple, try to hide under the huge hop flavor/bitterness. Still can make them out and they provide just enough counter-punch to the alpha acids. Finish is dry, with lingering citrus and resin bitterness. Medium-full body, with a slightly syrupy feel, before the finish. Warming, but pretty easy to drink. This seems pretty fresh (but I still wish there was a bottled on date on this thing!"
"I have to rate this one just a shade lower than Dreadnaught. There's a creamy fruity character to that one that makes it special. This one is more of a ``oh, you like hops, huh?'' kind of beer. Very hopped up, yet still balanced and drinkable."
"Three Floyds is one of my favorites. This one is up to their standards."
"Wolf pours a hazy gold with a thin head. The nose is very hop forward, and just intoxicating. What a BEAUTIFUL smelling beer. The taste is sublime. The hops meld perfectly with the citrus, without burning out your tastebuds. The hop profile in this is as perfect as I've had in any beer. The mouthfeel is awesome. Just a slight bitterness, that hangs around on your palate long after the swallow. FFF is now definitively my favorite brewer. Hands down."
"O: Overall very good, but definitely a beer for the hop heads. The focus seems to me to be a little too strong on the harsh bitterness without much consideration to the malt, which isn't my preference. Regardless, it is tasty, interesting, and a good break."
"O - Three Floyds is always expensive, but 16$ a bottle includes shipping. I recommend whatever you can get from this brewery, and this is the best I've had yet. Thanks to 3F!"
"Overall, one of the best imperials I've ever had. I was a little disappointed by my recent encounter with Dreadnaught, but that was more than likely a freshness issue. This more than made up for that, Cheers!"
"O - Good DIPA but I prefer others."
"M: Pretty light for the style leading to unexpected drinkability (danger!) Dry finish."
"I have been bit by the Arctic Panzer Wolf and I like it! But watch out...that 9% will bite you in the head quickly with a buzz of yummy citrusy fresh hops!"
"Arctic Panzer Wolf pours nearly completely hazy. It vacillates between tangerine and straight orange, and has about two fingers of white head. The foam shows both retention and lacing that are alright, but fail to impress (second pour was across the board better, and earned a small score bump). The nose is very tropical fruity. Smells like lots of Amarillo and/or Citra to me. The white wine promised in the writeup on the bottle is present as well, but a little more elusive. Finally, pine shows up as a barely there aroma. While there were no malty notes present in the nose, there is a little bit of bread and caramel sweetness to lead things off flavor wise. Just a little though, before we get to the business at hand, namely hops. Mid palate bitterness is pronounced, yet smooth. It demands attention without taking a scorched earth approach to my taste buds. White wine is more prominent here than in the nose, it comingles with apricot and more tropical fruits for leading flavors. Pine is still very much a background accent, but has more oomph here. The body is pleasantly light for a 9% beer, especially since it's not as bone dry flavor wise as some west coast interpretations of the style. Carbonation is spot on, a little high and it adds to the beer's brightness of flavor. I love this beer for the same reason I love Nelson from Alpine. It's not only a very well crafted version of the style, but the inspired hop choices result in a unique brew that escapes the rote (if not still enjoyable) citrus/grapefruit notes of most IPAs and imperial versions. This is one that separates itself from the pack and I would gladly seek out again."
"Medium to full bodied with above average carbonation, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden for 9.0 % abv. A nice DIPA, but not as good as Dreadnaught."
"This is every bit the equal of Dreadnaught and a great addition to the 3F lineup. Drink this one fresh though. Fresh bottles and off draft are some of the best beers I've had, but more than a few weeks old and it loses a ton of its great flavors."
"A diggable brew."
"-aRs-"
"This one went down fast. I've had some good hoppy beers, but this one seems way underrated. Got another bottle to trade, but chances are slim to none it ever makes it out of my apartment."
"Pours a bright golden straw color. Active carbonation creates a nice frothy white head, sticks around for a few minutes. Nice clarity, very summery look. Aromas are of intense pine and lemon, very focused nose, citrus driven. Flavor is very clean, crisp light body and generous hops. Very one dimensional beer, I really enjoyed it, but there's nothing to make it stand out amongst it's peers."
"Overall very solid. Recommended!"
"O - I liked this one. It wasn't as good as the Dreadnaught I opened right before it but it was still pretty good. Another winner from FFF in my book."
"Overall I like Dreadnaught better but I am NOT complaining about this one. I would be interested to read what FFF describes this as, but its not listed on their site."
"O - A big nasty DIPA that is as intense as the awesome label suggests!"
"D ~ Very glad to have another in my fridge from this year (new artwork) to straight-up enjoy again, but in a fresher state."
"O: Overall this is a solid IIPA. I wish I knew the date on this one. I think it would be even better if it was freshly bottled. Unfortunately I will never know until 3F's decides to date their bottles. All in all a great offering from 3F's. 4.0"
"D- Overall, I would describe this beer as a """nectar of the gods.""" A perfect after-dinner drink for the serious beer lover. Lots of sweet malty goodness with plenty of hopped up bitterness to back it up. It's incredibly thirst-quenching for how thick and alcoholic it is, haha. Just because it comes in a bomber, don't plan on sharing."
"Drinkability is high. A lot of flavor, well balanced, and little alcohol presence make for a very enjoyable beer."
"For a 9% DIPA, it packs a lot of punch flavor-wise, yet is still very smooth. I think this drink is all about balance. Despite the bottle art, I found this was not aggressive at all, but still had all the flavor I needed."
"Huge bitterness. Huge hop flavor--exactly what was advertised."
"O: A great imperial IPA. Well done 3 F's."
"O - The finish is much more like a west coast IPA. I prefer the citrus midwestern IPA's."
"D - Seemed a little subdued for what I was expecting from 3F but the hops build with each sip. Very Nice."
"Overall this is a very solid DIPA. It takes a couple hits because of the mellowed out hop aroma and an appearance that looks more like an adjunct lager then a DIPA. That said its a very nice beer and will definitely be looking for it again."
"Overall an ok IPA. Probably wouldn't try and get it again through a trade but would have again if I had access to it."
"What else can I say. A great beer from a great brewer that I only wish we could get here in PA. Well done FFF."
"Overall, FFF gives you a very good, I would say classic take on the Imperial IPA style. Lots of bitter hops, strong citrus flavors, especially grapefruit, a little dryness and a medium body for a well balanced and enjoyable beer. Very satisfied with my first bottled Three Floyds experience… hopefully I can have more soon! 4"
"O: Never had a BAD 3 Floyds beer, maybe one or two not as fresh, this bottle MIGHT be old (label) but still tastes great"
"Cheers!"
"O: Arctic Panzer Wolf is brewed to highlight hops and enhance drinkability, and I think it more than meets those objectives. This beer is the best West Coast style DIPA east of the Rockies. With that said, I can think of a dozen DIPAs brewed on the West Coast that are better."
"O: Good DIPA but nothing to write home about. Could use some more hops in the taste and much more in the aroma as well as a bit more head/retention and carbonation. Drinkability is good none the less and the 9% ABV is well hidden."
"This bottle gives the indication of not being the freshest it could be. Perhaps if consumed fresher I would have experienced an excellent carbonation, head, body, and the tropical fruits and pineapple that other BAs have mentioned. And if I ever do experience that in a fresher bottle, I shall have to come back and redo this review. But as it stands, my bomber was merely a slightly better-than-average IPA which could have been absolutely amazing but fell short from lack of the factors mentioned above."
"Overall is a great beer. This is the first IPA I've tries from Three Floyd's and am really looking forward to trying more."
"Overall, great drinkable DIPA that you will crave intensely hoppy and satisfying for those of us who enjoy these beers. Well done as always they have a very low fail rate and more often than not their beers are awesome. Even lighter styles like the recent export style lager I had from them was a great version, these guys can brew and they're definitely on the map for more than just Dark Lord Day and mysteriously burning down every month."
"Overall very tasty brew very nice aroma, that carries over to the taste. I wonderful example of a great style, but then again FFF knows how to make a good I2PA."
"May like this more than Dreadnaught, will have to review my notes on that to compare."
"Got a stinger(22oz) bottle of Artic Panzer Wolf during a recent visit to 3 Floyds. The beer is a cloudy golden in color with thin white head. The aroma included...hops...not question. There were hints of pine and citrus. The taste was full bodied with great balance between the hop characteristics and elevated IBU. It was quite smooth. The mouthfeel was downgraed slightly due to the higher ABV...which would make it tough to session. Definitely worth a try."
"O- I was quite impressed with this DIPA. Although it's not quite Dreadnaught, it's a very good DIPA with a surprisingly light and smooth character."
"Overall: Another enjoyable hopped-up IIPA from FFF. Has a prominent whallop of hop aroma and flavor, and the malt profile isn't syrupy and cloying like some IIPAs. 9% ABV is well-concealed, and creeped up on me as I neared 3/4 of the way through the bottle."
"O - Wow, this one just lingers and lingers with the hop bite and dryness. I have never had such a dry DIPA. Not a beer I'd want to be stuck on a desert island with but another solid brew from FFF."
"Poured from bottle (Red label) into tulip. Pours a brilliant, translucent gold. Wonderful white head about a finger thick, disappears quickly, leaving a ring about the circumference. In the nose I pick up sweet melon, piney hops, grapefruit. On the tongue it is sweet, but quite bitter. Hops give a great snap, backed by the citrus. A bit of must from the yeast. But it matches. Mouthfeel is good, great carb and easy to drink. Overall, APW is a great brew, and will satisfy and craving for an IIPA"
"100 IBUs? how can this go down so smoothly?"
"O - Overall, this is an excellent DIPA. Three Floyds rarely disappoints. Seek this one out."
"Three Floyds continues to impress me with their quality and masterful use of hops. This is a top notch DIPA and one worth seeking out."
"O - If I hadn't already tried Dreadnaught and Apocalypse Cow I think I would have enjoyed this more. It's good, but so far it's last on my list of FFF DIPAs I'd choose."
"Poured hazy copper color with a large creamy white head that was mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Heavy complex citrus hop and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with slick texture and soft carbonation. Heavy smooth bitter citrus flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish of long duration with a small alcohol burn as it warms. This is a standout beer."
"Overall, not as good as dreadnaught, but then, what is? Another solid DIPA from FFF."
"O - Not a bad offering from Three Floyds but from a brewery with such a reputation as theirs I think people probably expect more from the beers given what they have and can produce. This offering is definitely a solid DIPA but for $12/22oz bottle it might be a little steep."
"Overall, an excellent IIPA. It has a slightly harsh bitterness but it's a good balance with the slight sweetness and some of the more citrus hop flavor."
"O: I appreciate the hop intensity, the lingering bitterness, but that doesn't mean I have to be crazy about it. I guess my score here harkens to the old 'Drinkability', because really the only non-'good' thing for me was the look; still, my overall impression was that this lupulin-bomb doesn't really match my tastes and, as such, wouldn't be a beer I'm as prone to seek out again. But big thanks for the chance to try it, Matt!"
"Shared this one with beeruser and funkydelic at one of our weekly tastings. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tangerine, fruit hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, orange, tangerine, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The hops on this one were a little faded if I am honest. This did however allow the fruit character on this one to shine through quite nicely. The aroma on this one was pretty good with the tangerine hanging around on your nose mixed with the fruity hop note. A definite must try if you get the chance as this was a nice example of the style, even without the hop presence."
"Thanks to Will (futura123) for a really solid and enjoyable beer."
"Sent to me quite fresh thanks to a good friend. Perfect pour. Thick lacy head over an orangish straw IPA. Nose has big hops and malts, but not as explosive as I expected. Taste is near perfect. Great blend of fresh bitter hops and big malts. Clean yet full body. Nice hoppy finish. Good, but not on the same level as Dreadnaught."
"Loved this beer. Might be my favorite beer to date. Unfortunately it's about $9.50/22 but now that I found out it's distributed in Wisconsin, it will be a nice treat."
"Fuller medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and bubbly on the tongue. A solid DIPA, although I thought Dreadnaught was better - it's still tough to tell though without any freshness dates (please!)"
"O: If you like IIPAs, you need to try this beer. Seriously just a good, good beer."
"D-Overall this is a Super solid DIPA. Love the hop and citrus balance as well as a misterious creamy or imperial taste. Will get this again. And would reccomend it to anyone forsure."
"O- I’d consider this the wild younger brother of Dreadnaught. While no where near as hugely complex and as balanced as it, APW is a very solid IIPA on its own and if you are in the mood for a highly drinkable brew with a massive hop presence, look no further."
"O- I am very impressed with this one, solid DIPA from 3 Floyds, it’s been a while since I had Dreadnaught but I would have to say I enjoyed APW a lot more, big hoppy fruity beer, really easy drinkability and the abv is well hidden."
"Bottle: Poured a light amber colour ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some great lacing. Aroma of floral hops with lightly sweet malt base is enjoyable. Taste is also a mix between some floral hops with light citrus notes and some light sweet malt. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Good but not as character full as I was expecting - I am thinking this bottle might not be as fresh as I had expected."
"Overall: I'd probably place this one in the upper half of the more hop-forward DIPAs I've tasted. Definitely the immature younger brother to Dreadnaught, but nonetheless, another great example of how FFF is one of the most consistent breweries out there."
"O- Another very well balanced beer by Three Floyds. Man, they got this IPA thing down. Definitely need more."
"O: well, this is a good beer. Now if only it were on my shelves..."
"O - Very good IIPA. One of the better piney IIPAs I've had with the nice balance of citrus in there and complete hop flavor profile that 3 Floyds seem to be great at. Very drinkable and dangerous at 9% abv. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"Alright, this was one of the few three floyds that I thought were just ok. I like strong IPA's but this did not rise up to other breweries standards, and I was jacked to try the Wolf. Heavy but not tastey hops and a little worse after taste. I will say that this beer was seven weeks old and travel several hundred miles via honda CRV to get to me. So I will try again. Good Day."
"O: This is honestly the strongest piney flavor in a beer I've had, it takes a little getting used to. Most big DIPAs are very citrusy but not this one. Definitely check it out if you like pine."
"A masterpiece. I love a good citrusy IPA and this is one of the best. Hops are bright, green, fresh, and lively. Wish I had a case of these stashed away."
"O: This is a nice brew. Definitely a change from the citrus hop forward brews that FFF's do so well, but the result is quite enjoyable."
"O- Unlike Dreadnaught, the bombers are just as good as the draft. This beer is very different from Dreadnaught but still a Floyds beer."
"Overall - this is a really fresh bottle(new label just released the last 2 weeks),so I was suprised how subtle the hops tasted and smelt and how much alcohol I could pick up. I was expecting more but defintiely not a bad double IPA by any means. Just a little too subdued for me."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for the opportunity to try this brew. 22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip at 50 degrees. Pours a slightly hazy tangerine hue with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a soapy bull's eye swirl with a creamy band around the edges. Some spots of lacing but no legs. Nose expresses grapefruit sweetness, tropical fruits, citrus rind and an earthy quality - all in that order. Taste reveals citrus, but the sweetness is much more subdued than suggested by the nose. Earthy/piny/rind character comes out towards the middle and back. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with lively carbonation that is evenly distributed from start to finish. Finish is crisp and semi-dry. A solid DIPA - alcohol is well-hidden and I really dig the nose, but I like my DIPA's a little sweeter."
"great beer, smooth, creamy, refreshing."
"22 oz bomber into a snifter...big bright golden IPA...head is a little light, but alcohol content is big so that's understandable...color is awesome...tons of fruit in the nose and not quite as much hoppiness as I expected, even though I know this puppy is up in the 100 IBU range. it's pretty bitter on the tongue though, with an appropriate balance. Crisp, fruity, bitter. Kudos to this beer for tasting completely unique. It's definitely 'not normal' as they say. Pretty incredible beer. I can barely taste the alcohol but I can feel it. Oh yeah, mouthfeel is perfect too."
"Overall: Super drinkable, but undistinguished and one-dimensional. This tastes like a myriad other American IPA's. All bitterness and citrus, no balance or excitement."
"This bottle arrived a week ago and features the new label. This beer pours a very, very pale gold in color with a one finger bright white head that quickly dissipates. It looks like a traditional pale ale. The nose is of grapefruits, citrusy hops, and I get an odd spiciness to finish it off. It smells great and you can smell the glass from a few feet away. It tastes of sweet citrusy and lightly piny hops with a soft pale malt backbone. It works well and is a pretty light drinker compared to most DIPAs that're pretty sticky and feature caramel malts. It does finish pretty dry though and is a gateway to cotton mouth. I am a fan of this one and I think it's better out of the bottle than on tap."
"Overall this is another great beer; same flavor profile as Pliny, not at balanced as Dreadnaught. If you like 3 Floyds, you will love this. While I thoroughly enjoyed this, I prefer my DIPAs more balanced. Hop bomb... yes. Recommended... yes as well."
"O - Final verdict: While much of this brew borders on the unpleasant, it never crosses over that line. This is basically the big-boy juice here; if you can't take it, go home and change your panties."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. This is a pale golden color with around an inch of head. Smell is heavy on the hops with some sweet pine sap and honey in the background. Taste is a crisp bitter hoppiness with some pine flavors. Alcohol is hidden very well. This is very solid and bitter IPA."
"Taste: Hoppy, but not as bitter as I was expecting. It begins bitter and then becomes slightly fruity sweet and then leave a not quite as powerful bitterness as an aftertaste. There is no alcohol taste even though it is fairly high in ABV."
"Many thanks to Alex (page101) for hooking me up with this on an awesome trade! Slightly hazy yellow-orange pour with one finger head with decent retention and nice lacing. One of the lightest colored Imperial IPAs I've had. Lots of floral west coast IPA citrus in the nose with this one, complemented nicely with piney resin. Lemon and grapefruit are most prominent with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is dominated by huge citrus notes. Tons of grapefruit and tangerine with a great bitter hop bite. With that said, plenty of sweet malt to balance it out perfectly. The alcohol is almost non-existent making this scary drinkable for an imperial. When you get into this level of quality, it's hard to distinguish which is beer is better. This is right up there with Pliny, Dreadnaught, Sculpin, etc. It's only my second Three Floyds beer ever, but I think it's safe to say that Three Floyds lives up to all the hype!"
"O- very nice beer. I had the dreadnaught last night and am pleased to to have been able to try both of these long wanted 3F IPA's. I like the unbalancedness of this one. piney goodness."
"O: I'm constantly impressed by everything put out by FFF and this is no exception."
"Very drinkable imperial IPA."
"Color was dark, Smell was wonderful, Tate even better. If this was available regularly it would be one of the ones always in my fridge."
"o - overall, another impressive offering from FFF."
" Overall great DIPA Very tasty,FFF just doesnt dissapoint.Get it for sure."
"O: A good beer but I hope the 2 year old bottle of FFF Behemoth has more complexity next year when I crack it. This was quite good though, and I'm glad I was able to try it."
"Overall I was kind of let down by this beer after smelling it, but the taste really came through and met my expectations. Well worth a shot."
"O-Another great beer from 3F. Starting to wish they distributed to Upstate NY. Just another reason I'm happy I went to DLD."
"I know Lagunitas' IPA is half the strength, but it is twice as balanced. Same goes for their MAXIMUS IPA, both of which I would rather drink."
"O: I absolutely love this beer. This is probably the best DIPA I have experienced thus far very early on in my craft beer experience. I haven't been let down by any FFF beer. Great job!!"
"O: Solid offering by Three Flyods. It holds up to other DIPAs with just a sweeter finish instead of the astringent finish of some over the top hoppy DIPAs."
"22 ounce bottle, I have no idea how fresh this is. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a slightly cloudy golden/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit, apricots, orange peel) and pine hops. Flavor is mainly bitter hops. Both the citrusy and pine flavors are noticable, but initially the bitterness is strong and lingers around for a while before it eases up. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with decent carbonation. I think this is a solid brew, but given a choice I'd much rather have Dreadnaught instead."
"The aroma is a bit east-coast-malty and I was afraid it would be a bit sweet for our California palates, but it's seriously delicious and I'm worried about the 9% ABV. It's going down easy as I type."
"O: Honestly the only thing holding this one back is its appearance - it just doesn't look anything like a DIPA. However, since I put way more stock in how a beer smells and tastes, it's a small hurdle to clear. This beer is incredible."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it’s a good beer overall but there are several others in the style and a few made by 3F that I would choose first."
"O: Very drinkable and tasty, but not my favorite from FFF. I prefer the Dreadnaught for its more unique citrus flavors, but this is still a good DIPA."
"Presently splitting a bomber with my wife. Poured into a glass. Very nice orange color with alot of citrus on the nose. Very hoppy and fruity taste. Kind of a bitter aftertaste. I'd have to try them side by side, but IMO this is a bit mellower version of alpha king that allthough is good, didn't wow me like i was expecting it to. one bottle is plenty for me."
"Great tropical flavors in an ale with an arctic name brewed in the temperate zone. Gotta love it."
"O: Wonderful Double. I loved the fruitiness and flowery hops mingling to create a very balanced drink."
"Poured out as a yellowish gold color with a decent sticky head that laced the glass pretty well. Sweet floral aroma, lots of hops on the nose and very inviting smell. Really big hop bitterness on tongue fades into a dry citrusy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is oil and medium bodied. Overall this is a really good IPA. Highly enjoyable."
"O: Fantastic example of an imperial IPA, hops not overbearing or overly bitter. Excellent balance between piney and citrusy hops. Nice lingering bitterness, somewhere between 70-100 IBUs. I can't imagine what this tastes like super fresh, so I guess I'll have to seek out some more APW when it is released next."
"Overall: Not a fan. Rife with off flavors that ruin it ."
"D- For the alcohol content and the flavor profile, this drinks pretty nicely. A bomber will sure do ya."
"O- This is how I like my IIPAs, West Coast style."
"Overall, an awesome beer that, once again, I can't get here in MI."
"This is a medium bodies brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A bold sipper but enjoyable with dank and herbal hop qualities that never quite felt oily or resinous but they clearly pack a big hop punch. A solid take on the style, it's worth giving a try."
"a great DIPA, a piece of me likes this more than dreadnaught."
"D= Really a very drinkable beer despite the huge bitterness and high ABV. Very well crafted to push the limits yet remain drinkable and complex. Highly recommended."
"On draft at the brewery. It's damn good, but it ain't Dreadnaught. Appearance is the weakest part; a little light for a double, but I think it's part of its seasonal shtick. Smells fantastic; it's this beer's best attribute. Taste and mouthfeel are both good. They may have been rated higher, but I'm comparing it to Dreadnaught, which probably isn't fair. Overall, a good seasonal variety worth trying."
"Don't think I've had this much Simcoe in a DIPA before."
" A dry bitterness lingers in the mouth on the finish. Orange peels, pine, grapefruit, floral citrus rounds it out as well, with some malty sweetness."
"o: Excellent offering from Three Floyds. I need to try this side by side with Dreadnaught. If memory serves, I think I'd prefer Dreadnaught but this fight is going 12 rounds."
"This is a very good DIPA, very tasty and refreshing. The alcohol at 9% is not that noticeable, and one needs to keep in check the inclination to drink a few of these quickly."
"Bottle into Three Floyds nonic. Orange yellow color with tiny white collar, no lacing and nothing to really retain. Smells a bit on the malty side, very basic pale malts. Some resinous pine, alcohol, astringent hops. Any aroma hops have faded. Taste is very bitter but not too flavorful. Slightly grassy, alcohol, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to high carbonation and a medium body. I have a feeling this beer is old. Three Floyds, DATE YOUR BOTTLES. Or, even worse, if this beer is fresh, its one of the most boring double IPAs I have had in a while. Drinkable, but definitley not memorable."
"O: Excellent. I am really impressed with the hoptastic brews from Munster. Cheers to Three Floyds!"
"Overall, not a bad DIPA, though I vastly prefer the syrupy tongue bashing imposed by Dreadnaught."
"A hearty recommendation from me - this is worth seeking out."
"Pours a hazy yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops. In the taste, a dry orange citrus hop presence that just doesn't quit. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange rind flavor in the aftertaste. Quite smooth and delicious, nice orange citrus and hops."
"Overall, a really nice DIPA with great hop flavors and balance. Of all the 3 3Floyd's IPAs I've had (the other two being Apocalypse Cow and Dreadnaught), this was my favorite by a long shot. Highly recommended."
"D- 4 This is a really good imperial IPA. As I've mentioned before, I'm not the biggest hop-head (probably wouldn't have more than a bomber in a sitting), but the style is growing on me and I certainly appreciate it. This brew's aroma is excellent and has a well-balanced taste taboot. It is up there with the best of the style (that I've tried), and it's worth a shot if you can get your hands on it."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and juicy during the fruit start, moves to a dryness from the pine, and has a semi-sticky finish from the hop/malt combo. Solid. Drinkability is good, though the resin at the back burns a bit. This is ok, but I'd rather have a fruity beer like this be smooth and neutral the whole way through. Definitely need to get my hands on Dreadnaught in the near future."
"Not as good as dreadnaught but it is A very good seasonal dipa and I will be looking for more from them in the future"
"Overall this beer is top notch. Although not my favorite, I'd gladly revisit this anytime an opportunity arises."
"Pours a bright amber with an orange hue. A fairly decent-sized white head with good head retention and decent lacing. huge amounts of Hops on the nose Pine and Grapefruit, along with a small amount of sweet fruit. Medium bodied, extremely dry and bitter. Tastes like I'm drinking straight-up grapefruit juice with a hint of pine on the back-end. Balanced nicely, hops lingers on for a while. excellent IIPA. My 1st FFF brew, I have many more to come."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Overall it was better than I expected."
"This one was a very good IPA to me and I loved the citrus aspects in this beer as to me they are nailed pretty well."
"I would love to get super fresh to sample for comparison. I didn't pay for this beer, and I bet it was a nice chunk of change..."
"the CPJ"
"Really solid. Def worth seeking out."
"D: Good drinkability, had a bomber to myself no problem. Nice fruity hop flavors."
"CHEERS!!"
"Overall I didn't care for this. The lack of a freshness date makes it tough to determine the age of this bottle, though the guy at Binny's seemed to think it was fairly fresh."
"DELICIOUS; GRAB A BOTTLE!"
"Surprisingly drinkable, the sweetness is just enough to balance out the bitterness. One of my new favorite DIPAs, though it'll be tough to find it down the road."
"All in all this is a very drinkable beer. Probably a good thing I only had one or I would probably go for another one which would make for a rough morning."
"Overall, an excellent double IPA! I'm reviewing this from the bomber bottle but ive had this once before on tap at 3 Floyds Brewpub and trust me, it only gets better! 3F there balance out the window and just hopped the hell out of this. Recommend for 3 Floyds fans and hop heads!"
"Drinkability: Very easy drinker and I never got a sense of the high alcohol from this beer."
"This is one of my all time favorite's. I will say that sometimes this beer can be a bit much, but most of the time it goes down super smooth. For obvious reasons it's always compared against Dreadnaught, but for me when my store has both, I always grab this one first, and then I grab a Dreadnaught too."
"D- 9oz pour is enough. great beer, but pretty unbalanced"
"Drinkability: A really good beer I put down in no time with my lady. Yet another beer I wish I could get regularly."
"D: Highly drinkable... but still not as special or complex as Dreadnaught or Blackheart."
"I like my IPAs bitter and this one certainly fills the bill in that respect. The peach and apricot flavors are different than the usual citrus characteristics that I'm used to, and I'm enjoying this beer. Cheers!"
"Great beer that is right on par with the rest of their lineup."
"The drinkability is very good. This doesn't taste more than 6%."
"I find this to be a very drinkable beer for the style and absolutely love the finish and fresh fruity character. That being said, it is a bit much at times and while I am definitely enjoying the ride, I was ready to get off near the end of the bottle. While I don't think this is quite as well put together as the world class Dreadnaught, I definitely will try to pick up another bottle of this next time I am in Three Floyds country."
"Overall- A very nice DIPA, with citrus being the main focus. I prefer this over BrooDoo but it is no Dreadnaught; which seems like the obligatory comparison with this one. ABV's are hid well, and the bomber is going down very quickly."
"This isn't in the same realm of complexity as Dreadnaught, but it's specificity and focus and overall deliciousness have significant merit. If you can try this beer, do not hesitate. Especially if you're someone who enjoys both hoppy beer and classic white wine varietals."
"OVERALL: Wasn't really thrilled with this one. The flavor was alright, but the light, bubbly body with the overly astringent finish was a definite detractor. Not a bad beer, just nothing worth writing home about. I'd skip this one and choose Dreadnaught any day. Regardless, I'd wanted to try this one for a long time. Thanks again for the opportunity thomashardy."
"The body is slightly oily with a moderately heavy finish. Carbonation level is alright. Heavy stuff though. This beer errs on the sweet side of the DIPA spectrum. Candy-like hops start it out, then finish with a bitter punch across the mouth. Nothing lingers long though, as the bitterness is fleeting. Leafy hops, grass, lemon. This definitely carries juicy flavors. Alcohol is noticeable, especially as this warms. This was a great beer for sure, but man, I wish I would have split this with a friend. Really rich stuff. Thanks again, Nate!"
"D- Found this very easy to drink and recommended."
"Thanks to dgfair for this bomber (no date), which was poured in a dimpled mug. Pours hazy yellow along with a thin veil of white foam. Potent mango-pine aroma, classic strong IPA aromas, but a little on the fruity side. The flavors blend very well, you can certainly feel the bitterness, but there is also a lot of strong sweet fruity flavors to compensate, I got practically no alcohol flavors. Palate is good, a bit slick but very enjoyable nonetheless. Medium bodied with average carbonation, and a very slight syrupy texture. Bites more than a Dreadnaught which this one cannot match. Overall a very nice sessionable DIPA!"
"D- A decent dipa and a total hop bomb. Not my favorite but I would revisit it."
"This pours a burnt orange with a nice, two finger head that dies down to almost nothing with no lacing. On the nose there is a huge hop presence, more like an orange than like a grapefruit, with the pine further back. On the tongue the piney hop character comes to the front with the citrus notes riding behind. In the mouth the body is medium, a bit lighter than I would have expected, and there is a great prickly pine and alcohol note that lingers for a long while. I split the bomber with the lady and I probably could have had the whole thing, but probably not more than that. Pretty drinkable for a DIPA."
"Tried this side by side with Apocalypse Cow from dateless bottles received recently from WLV Liquors. APW was slightly duller in color (cloudy golden/yellow) and had less head retention. Otherwise this exceeded AC in every other facet. Aroma is a unique blend of herbal, floral and citrus hops. Grassy and grapefruit rind like. Flavor is dank, bitter, dry and hoppy. A strong toasted malt body with minimal sweetness balances out a dry rind and bitter grapefruit hop body. Much more resiny, than the sweet AC; this drank much smoother and was a more enjoyable DIPA."
"D - This is a very good Imperial IPA. Love the fruit hop presence."
"Mouthfeel is a little light for a DIPA but there's a solid amount of carbonation and sticky hops. That general crispness makes this one highly drinkable and enjoyable. If this one comes out again, I'll seek it out."
"Drinkability: Not overly malty or thick. Maintains a nice balance between hops, bitterness, and malt."
"D: Not bad for a 9.00% beer. Pretty easy to finish off the bomber."
"Drinkability: Not particularly drinkable, no. Abrasive, grating, and unpleasant."
"More hops come tumbling in during this deluge! This participant pours a lightly hazy golden amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, pine, mint, and some light leek. The taste holds notes of pine, leek, light grapefruit, caramel, spearmint, and lettuce. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA, though a bit greens-heavy for my liking."
"Drink- Don't get me wrong. I live in CA and we do some good IPA's. But 3F has some damn good beers. I suggest you start trading for them if you live in CA like I do."
"This bomber was relatively fresh so I anticipated goodness. The beer pours the standard golden color with white head. The aroma was kinda filled with citrusy hops, but the nose was balanced with a decent variety of malt notes. The overall flavor was a sweet malt base with hops covering overtop. This went down extraordinarily easy I must say this was a damn tasty beer that I had. I'm glad that I pulled the trigger on this particular brew."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer a lot - I can only imagine how good this would have been straight off the bright tank. At 9.0%, it's not prohibitive, and it's certainly not out of the ordinary for the style. A fat, resin-fueled DIPA from a fantastic brewery, this one is definitely one seeking out, and I hope that 3F makes this again, if only so I can get a bottle as soon as one comes off the bottling line."
"This is an interesting one. It is very good for a dry-hopped beer."
"Very drinkable and good, yet almost a bit unremarkable compared to some of the their other Pale Ale's."
"Verdict: Almost flawless and a wonderful beer, unique and worth whatever it costs to get it."
"There is definitely something a little different in this DIPA than the standard, which I am guessing is contributed by the Canadian 2 Row Malt as described on the bottle. Quite enjoyable, though a bit of a slow drinker overall."
"A little thin, honestly, is my first reaction. All of a sudden, the smell isn't as cool. No doubt I'm being critical--that's what I do when I write reviews--but it's missing something. It's good, but short of my sky-high expectations. I guess the hops are sufficient (I so don't want to say """more hops"""), and it's the FEEL that seems lacking--too thin and dry. Is it fair? Should I share that I keep thinking about Hopslam's arrival as I sit here sipping? I don't know what to blame...I look back at the bottle and pick the Canadian malt (damn Canadians--j/k). It's not bitter enough. It's not sweet enough. Oh, geez, it's not Hopslam enough, okay? It's good but, unfortunately, forgettable. Still, it's good enough to drink all day. Thank you, Will (wilwfu), for this one--from a box so good nobody'd believe me if I listed its contents."
"Then, it hits me: this hop monster is not of the scaring kind! It's a friendly beast! It's welcoming like those nordic people who settled on our shores of Lake Michigan so many generations ago, the offspring of vikings, who seemed so large and unruly at the time, but instead of slaying us; invited us over for coffee and sweet kringle."
"Overall, a delicious and well crafted brew. Impressive, even if it is way overpriced at $12.99 a bomber."
"A nice addition to the 3Floyds stable of brews."
"An above average DIPA worth trying but probably not going out of your way for."
"D: Undeniable palate wrecker, but I'm a masochist for this sweet punishment. I will get another bomber before they're gone."
"d- glad i got the chance to try this from daveonba, wouldn't have known about this - top notch, really tasty, as has everything i've tasted from FFF."
"D -This is a tasty beer, but the heavy grapefruit and lemon rind bitterness limit it's drinkability for me."
"D - goes down easy."
"D - A DIPA from FFF? Give it to me! This is like Dreadnaught Lite. Great stuff and definitely a beer to appreciate on draught."
"Overall, this is an absolutely great addition to the Floyds' arsenal of beers. If you have a chance certainly pick it up."
"D-A simply lovely light bodied DIPA. FFF are the long established masters of the hops and this beer proves to be no exception. Light malt with tropical fruit hops and sharp biting finish....just like I like them!"
"Thank you iowahawk for providing me with the opportunity to experience this fine offering from 3F, a classic maker of the style."
"Bitter best describes this brew. In fact over bittered is more like it. The mouthfeel is dominated by the punchy sharpness and hoppy twang in the finish. The good news is that the bitterness doesn't survive long, eventually warm and malty sweet beats it out. The one rocky patch of over bittering isn't enough to stop me from enjoying this one."
"Drink is decent, but not great, with a bit of warming tingly booze, some sweetness which dries a bit, a slight sticky finish, and the long bitterness that is delicious but doesn't bide well for drinkability."
"M- Medium bodied with a nicely subdued carbonation. Its quite resins with a long lingering bitter finish."
"Guessing DIPA, seems vaguely Three Floyds-y to me, though lacking in the bitterness of fresh Dreadnaught."
"Lots of bitter hop flavors from start to finish. The alcohol adds another layer of bitterness to this citric zest eruption. I noticed some bitter, tropical fruit flavors, maybe some crushed flower juice. This is a hot bitter bomb that can only be sipped."
"But that's not to say normal is bad. In fact, normal is pretty awesome sometimes. But when you've got a beer and a woman is wearing a bikini and a viking hat, you pretty much expect an epic experience. And although this one is drinkable despite it's 9.0% abv, it just doesn't make you think of spring break awesomeness."
"(58th)"
"Nice! I've been wanting to try this one and had some trades set up that never went through. So glad I got to try this. Big thanks to you Richard."
"All in all, this is a solid brew. Glad I got to try it. It is a very grapefruity IPA. A very overwhelming grapefruit flavor. If that's your thing, then definitely hunt this down, otherwise, try if you have access."
"I couldn't drink bombers back to back, but 22 oz is a nice serving size for this one."
"Beer pours a hazy light orange color with a thin white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving some soapy lace on the side of the glass. Smell is floral and sweet citrus hops with a bit of a bready/chalky smell on the backbone...more malt than I expected in the smell and almost smells like a lemon scone. The taste is a big smack of bitterness upfront that is very dry and mineral-like in taste. I pick up a slight medicinal quality before I get light malt and another smack of hop bitterness. Not much else in the taste but straight bittering hops. Finishes relatively heavy and warms as it goes down. Not very drinkable due to the huge bitterness. I think this is what they were going for, but only the most serious hopheads need apply. One of the lesser 3 Floyds IPAs in my opinion. Would take Dreadnaught every time over this."
"This Imperial IPA is very good with small foam but a nice golden yellow color with carbonation in the glass. The smell definitely tells you that it is a big IPA, and the taste is hoppy with notes of citrus(grapefruit) with a true Imp. IPA after taste. The beer feels very full flavored and full bodied and is very drinkable."
"This beer pours a surprisingly light color for the style. It has the appearance of unfiltered apple cider (with carbonation of course). The aroma is 100% hops! This might be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever smelled. The hops take front stage in the flavor; Slight citrus and lemongrass notes make their way into the taste. A hint of vanilla in the finish. Quite dry. This beer is for hop-lovers only!"
"Poured into my dfh snifter glass. Appearance is a light orange, copper color. Smell is big time orange and apricot..FFF really never disappoints in this area. Their dipa's always smell fantastic. Taste is similar to smell but not as strong which was a slight disappointment. Very bitter beer which I like a lot. Nice mouth feel, not too thin and not syrupy at all. Very drinkable and no hint of the 9% abv what so ever. I liked this beer and wouldn't mind snagging another bomber or if available to me. Recommended for sure."
"It pours really nicely, with a good amount of head and some lacing left on the glass. It is pale and a bit cloudy. It smells of grapefruit and citrus with some pine as well. There is a huge hop nose, and an even bigger hop taste. Quite bitter, but not astringent. Definitely very grapefruit and a bit piney.There is barely a hint to malt, and it is clear the FFF was going for hard core hops here. There is no trace of the 9% abv. Mouthfeel is pretty dry with nice fine carbonation. Drinking a 22 is a bit difficult, because despite the great taste, the bitterness gets a little bit much."
"D: If you like your DIPAs big and bold, give it a shot. the 9% makes one bottle enough for this guy."
"this liquid is delicious. while i originally assumed with no head and its thick appearance that this one may be on the heavier side, it proves not to be. i really just cant stop drinking it, especially as it warms up... it just gets better and better. tangerine and apricot hues swirl around in perfect harmony with just the right amount of dryness. this beer is a good example of letting the hops shine, with moderate but not overwhelming carbonation. drinkability would be a perfect were it not for the fact that it could get dangerous if i had a few of them... bedtime would come way too early."
"D: Outstanding. A tremendous Double IPA. Thanks again, Fletcher!"
"The flavor is captivating. Its everything you were expecting from the nose. Big, hops presence, medium bodied and just the right carbonation. Three Floyds know what they are doing with their India Pale Ales. Fantastic!"
"D-this is very juicy and sweet, well integrated hop presence with an assertive hop finish that truly doesn't kill the palate. Interesting spiciness to it with lots of sugars creating tasty stuff."
"The color is golden yellow, but hazy. The head is great with thick foam that becomes rich lacing. Smells of vanilla, spice, and orange marmalade. The flavor is outstanding: dry mint, slight juniper, slight eucalyptus, chewy yet smooth with a fantastic clean finish. In the background is delicious, rounded vanilla and clean malt. One of the best Imperial IPAs I've ever had, if the not THE best. I give it this credential because some Imperial IPAs are way over the top with """as much hops as a man (or woman) can take," giving the beer just too much in one direction and lacking any kind of balance or elegance. This beer is well rounded, with mellow flavors settling down the sharp hops. The ABV is hardly noticeable. The flavor is rich and gigantic without being too strong. Fabulous beer from 3 Floyds. One of the best beers I've had in months."
"A hopheads dream and another gem from FFF."
"Beer reminds me of Dreadnaught without the citrus overtones. Nice beer but not on the level of Dreadnaught."
"This is a very good brew, but just misses the mark of being in the same league as the best big IPAs I've had."
"This is an amazing IPA, I wish I had access to this beer - 'was lucky to find two bottles on a businesss trip to Chicago at a neighborhood beer store close to the Hop Leaf. This was a pricey beer, but well worth EVERY penny. I liked this one almost as well as Dreadnaught which I didn't think could be matched."
"Overall, this is a good beer and it is definitely drinkable. The ABV is well hidden, but the hops intensity also limits it. Very good either way."
"bomber from my midwestern brah, durrty dirts"
"Better than dreadnaught? Well no. One of the best IPA's on the planet? Without a question. Cannot recommend this more for hop heads."
"Fuzzy peach colored body. Hazy and chunky. Lots of yeast particles floating around. Not a bad thing. Thin creamy off white head leaves spotty lace. Awesome hop aroma. Very fragrant. Fresh and grassy. Minty. Piney. Flavor is more of the same. Fresh and bright. Orange marmalade. Piney. Grassy. Citric. Bitterness is very clean. Faint biscuit malts. Also passion fruits and peach, apricot and nectarine. Light-medium body. Dry. Carbonation is light. Dry finish. Very tasty and very drinkable. 9% alcohol is barely detectable. High quality DIPA here."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Drinkability: This is just a great DIPA. At this point, any DIPA from Three Floyds should be considered gold."
"Drinkability is pretty darn good for this high of an abv%."
"Beer is medium to surprisingly light in body. Chewy hops with mild hop sulfur bite in the mid to late palate, no sweetness up front, definitely not a malty IPA, beer finishes fine. Not too dry. I'd have it again, very fun."
"The beer is yellow with a slight haze. There are a few pieces of sediment floating around. The head is about a half inch thick and generates some random traces of lacing. The aroma is of hops and grapefruit. The beer tastes great, with alcohol content well hidden behind a bouquet of hops and tart citrus fruit. This is a solid beer that I would be happy to drink anytime."
"D - A good offering from FFF. I'll take their Dreadnaught over this but well done never-the-less. 4.0"
"Very good, but as mentioned, not Dreadnaught good - but then again, nothing else is. Still well worthwhile, and well above the average for the style."
"This beer provides a varied and interesting hop profile. It goes down very easily. I've loved all of 3 Floyd's hopped up beers, and this one doesn't let me down."
"drinkability is solid - i wish they would rotate this brew with dreadnaught just to shake things up"
"Nice flavors mostly, but slight hint of DMS infection lingers. Glad I tried this beer, I think it would be a real stand out without the slight cooked vegetable flavor."
"The bitterness makes this a sipper, but a bomber isn't hard to finish."
"Pours a very nice light copper/orange color with great head and wonderful lacing. Hugely wonderful scent with great citrus hop tones that wave in with orange, pineapple, and grapefruit, along with a wonderful sweet malty backing. Great flavor, a very deep maltiness that makes a wonderfully thick ale flavor to start with a huge hop finish, notably grapefruit, pineapple, and a wonderful piney taste. Goes down wonderfully smooth for such a high ABV beer. Great stuff from Three Floyds once again."
"D - This beer was delicious. I have been very impressed with 3F, especially their hoppier beers. This has good drinkability good flavors and great hop burst. Hope heads rejoice! (4.0)"
"Pours a very hazy bright golden color with a one-finger white head. The head dissipates rather quickly leaving behind a light cap and mild lacing. Really juicy, fruity hop aroma with notes of peach, apricot and grapefruit. Lighter scents of pine and biscuit malt along with a subtle boozy heat. The flavor is full of juicy grapefruit and peach hoppy notes up front with a considerable bitterness developing on the midpalate. The midpalate also has a mild biscuit malt backbone, and the dry finish, along with a lingering grapefruit bitterness, has a moderate booziness. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice alcohol warming effect. Despite the boozy heat, this is a fairly drinkable DIPA at 9% abv because of the great juicy hop flavors that balance out the bitterness a bit. I'd love to try this side-by-side with fresh Dreadnaught."
"D-Excellent DIPA....I like the hop flavors presented...IBU's must be high but the only real bittering kick is on the finish which is how I like it. Well done."
"Super-smooth with a complex hops profile. A lot going on here, but all well integrated. Hops are a bit sharp up front, but almost immediately moderate with a slightly fruity, honey note. Nice level of sweetness to balance the hops, but not sugary or syrupy. Finish is a long, fresh hops note."
"Excellent hop aroma, very citricy and floral aroma, hints of grapefruit. Mild hazy orange color, slight ran color. Little head retention, but pretty decent lacing. Strong hop at the beginning, high bitterness. Pleasant sweetness, with slight hint of alcohol content. Mild to moderate bitter finish, but very clean. Crisp finish with floral aftertaste. Last carbination, very cleansing. Overall very drinkable and refreshing for a DIPA. Delicious and of course never disappointing from three floyds."
"Had this back-to-back with Masala Mama, and I far preferred this. Just more what I'm looking with my IPA/DIPAs. A very nice beer."
"Overall, this was a world class DIPA in my book, and one that I will be seeking out again."
"overall a really well done double ipa. the best one of the night for sure. glad to be able to finally try this one."
"update: have revisited this...awesome nose. taste and mouthfeel very much like PtE. hops obliterate a pale malt base as intended."
"D/O- Drinkability takes a hit because of the high ABV but if you're being silly and wanted to drink more than you should I wouldn't blame you. Does Three Floyds make even a mediocre beer?"
"Overall, it is a decent iipa, but nothing sticks out to much. A bit above average, but nothing I am falling over for. It just seems like the hop profile is off on this one. Too sticky for me. Somewhat drinkable."
"D: APW is pleasantly sweet and puckering at the same time. It's not my favorite Imperial IPA (although Dreadnaught is from the same brewery), but it was quite enjoyable to imbibe."
"For an DIPA its not the worst in drinkability but it is slightly coying and sweet but the hops keep me wanting more and more so that helps a lot."
"This is a seriously beautiful beer. I haven't written a review here yet, so please give me a little slack. Tried this beauty @ the Comet Cafe in Milwaukee, WI. Wow. I didn't expect such a big hop drop to finish so smooth. I admittedly drank 2 right off the bat, and with an alcohol rating this high, it was a bold choice at one in the afternoon. It looked gorgeous served in a goblet, and went great with my lunch. My bartender told me it doesn't usually make it out of the brewery, but I haven't looked into that claim. Really good stuff. If you're a fan of Gumballhead, try to get your hands on this."
" D- Well it's another hop bomb from Three Floyds... and it is wonderful. It really opens up nicely and the bold flavor makes me want to drink more and more while the hop bitterness grows and starts to stain my tongue. This is a big juicy beer with good depth and easy drinkable."
"Classic AIPA drinkability."
"Drinkability: This is a very good take on the DIPA by Three Floyds. I wish I could even get there beers regularly, but I also wish this was a regular offering. Really outstanding beer."
"Thank MasterSki for sending this one my way, great beer and I will be looking for it anywhere I go"
"D- the whole time im drinking this one i cant help but think two things: """this is no dreadnaught""" and """this was better on tap.""" hopefully there is another chance to have another bottle as soon as it hits the shelf."
"good on drinkability scale. I would love to have this on tap. A very difficult beer to find so it's one to be enjoyed slowly when you have the opportunity to drink it."
"D- Just killed a bomber, going for another! (thats a good thing)"
"There's nothing outlandish or wild here, but this double IPA with the crazy axe-wielding Nordic chick on the absurd label is pretty good. I feel that it's a double IPA that could be well-enjoyed by both beer geeks and non-beer geeks alike. That doesn't mean it's a wussy beer, because it isn't - I just think it has very agreeable flavors that would appeal to a wide cross-section."
"Mouth feel is smooth with moderate levels of carbonation. This beer is insanely drinkable...every sip left me wanting another."
"D - This is really good would want another too bad 3FFF doesn't make 6 packs cause I would want this to be apart of it."
"Hazy peach pour into a Duvel tulip with 1/2""" white froth. Head is airy and bubbly. Big floral aroma of coconut, pink grapefruit, melon and pine. Touch of sweet on the aroma but overall very nice. Piney flavor up front with very dense grapefruit rind. Good bitterness and not sweet at all which I very much prefer with this style. Coconut mouthfeel, with navel orange crunchiness. Finishes very smooth."
"drinkability: good"
"Thanks to enelson for the bottle."
"D: It's been awhile since I've had Dreadnaught, so I can't quite compare it to that """other""" DIPA from Three Floyds. It's a nice beer that I enjoyed the bottle of to myself."
"Medium-thick body with a sticky composition. Combined with the flavors it gives the impression of sucking on fresh resinous hops. I liked it a lot but not sure how often I'd want to have it."
""""Arctic""" is a good name for this one, the hops have a cooling sensation. Paler than Dreadnaught and more herbal. Really really like it!"
"It's a good beer overall, but not sure what the hype is all about."
"d - A very nice DIPA. I thought it smelled great and had a lot of great citrus and pine hops to it. Would love to try again."
"Drinkability: This is a weekend beer for me, but would definitely make a nice weekday beer if you have a partner to share it with. This is a beer that you really need to let warm up. There are so many flavors that come out once it's reached room temperature. While I always like to let my beers warm up, this one seemed to benefit more than usual."
"D- This was a good DIPA. Better than Dreadnaught I thought. Once again a beer that's not normal from a brewery who is well known for brewing outside the box."
"MF/D: an initial sizzle of carbonation leaves the tongue numb for a relatively smooth/dry finish, certainly would lose feeling in my face with more than 1 bottle."
"While the rest in my tasting group disagree with me I have to say that this one was quite disappointing. I have read a couple posts about fresh Citra hops requiring some age to get rid of that mercapto urine aroma. I have no idea if Arctic Panzer uses Citra hops but I got a big hit of urine plus sulfur & vegetative aromas. By vegetative it is not the nice green notes from dry-hopping, it is the undesirable. Body & mouthfeel was nice but the flavor killed it for me."
"D: A hop and alcohol centered DIPA, with such a light malt backbone this one could pass for a IPA. Now, typically I wouldn't mind a hop-centric DIPA, but this one is so light on the malts that the alcohol shines through, in a rather distracting manner. Good, but not one of FFF's finest beers. (4.0)"
"Light, moderate carbonation, and slightly sticky. Very easy to take down, not overwhelming, but also not spectacular. Very good."
"a rather floral double. Heads is sticky candy. Not voluminous but leaves many spots of lace. Nose of subtle pineapple citrus and floral pine. Mix of citrus candy and intense pine dry bitter. Leaves a dry quality of the tongue its so floral. Like an excess of perfume. On the zesty dry side of doubles. No rich malt sweet. Clean and crisp."
"Drinkability -- I don't know if I could put away more than two of these in one sitting but it'd be worth a try. Great job 3 floyds!! Definitely my favorite craft brewer. Love your Gumballhead, Robert the Bruce, Dreadnaught. . . but this one blows them all away."
"Perhaps just a step off from the pace of Dreadnaught, Artic Panzer Wolf fits nicely into the collection of Three Floyds hop shelves; along side of Apocalypse Cow and rivaling Founders Double Trouble."
"D-alcohol hits quick! much quicker than i expect from even a 9% ABV, this might be better as a 12 oz. bottle. However, the taste stays pleasant through all 22 ounces!"
"D= For a 9% IPA it's going down smooth this is really a great beer difently worth checking this one out."
"The body is lighter than medium, with a good amount of carbonation. Here is the only pointthat I have ANY complaint about-- it feels a little too oily. It isn't bad at all-- but I wish it was more prickly than oily. In any case-- this beer is excellent and very easy to drink."
"D: Extremely balanced for an IIPA and the ABV is well hidden. I'll admit that I'm a homer when it comes to IPAs considering I have Alpine and Russian River readily available, but this is a damn good beer."
"Drinkability: Going down very easy for a 9% abv imperial ipa"
"D:Another great beer from FFF, don't quite like it as much as dreadnought. Would love if they have this year around like the roumors have been talking about"
"Thanks ridglens on this one, had plenty of FFF, and once again, they are the goods. Interesting pour, lighter than I was expecting, but really, who cares. This is a big citrus hop bomb as usual, and i love it. Smooth, easy to drink, but to compare this with the sister, or brother Dreadnaught, this is much easier to drink but Dreadnaught is more distinctive, maybe it's the honey flavors in the dread that I like more. This is still a very good beer, a must have, pretty smooth for 9%."
"Heard its pretty expensive. But it is quite drinkable."
"Pours a hazy gold with off white head that leaves good lacing. Smells are mostly hops, citrus hops and some sweet malt. Tastes are sweet malts at the front, then hops and a nice bitter finish, nice balance between the two. Mouthfeel is great. Nice amount or carbonation. Drinkability is great. FFF really know to make some hoppy beers and this one is no exception."
"D: Not a half bad DIPA. Not as great as Dreadnaught, but solid none the less. Another thanks to Mark for a great beer!"
"D: Wow, this is an excellent DIPA. On par with Dreadnaught. I really enjoyed the clean blast of hops without the overly heavy body/mouthfeel. Finish was bitter enough to remind you of the hop presence, but not so much to make a chewy finish or overly sweet. Very nice."
"D: Good brew for sure."
"Pours with a slight haze, goldenish color. Small white foam fades to ring. Good lace considering it was split 3 ways into pint glasses. Nice aromas of orange and a ton of sticky pine. Welch's white grape juice as well. It's bitter but not terribly so, sticky pine here as well contrasting the mouthfeel. Great expressive hop flavor, substantial body, good malt backbone. Another good DIPA from 3F."
"Huge pine flavor, this beer is like drinking Christmas. There's some grapefruit and ample caramel sweetness. Too much sweetness, in fact. The body is substantial, surprisingly so given the appearance. It finishes bittersweet with big pine and caramel flavors. Decent, but it drinks a bit sweet and heavy for my palate."
"Overall a decent DIPA. However by FFF standards this one does not measure up to the rest of their stellar line up of hop bombs."
"M/D- medium-light bodied. good carbonation. cannot pick up on the alcohol in here at all. very good drinking beer, minus that weird characteristic."
"D - This actually has a solid drinkability for a double IPA. It's not overly bitter or alcohol-rich and, while everything else is good, this is probably the best aspect of this beer."
"Thanks, GCurlow, for the opportunity"
"one sided and bitter up front with the gamut of citrus notes, and the bitterness falls out midway through, dry, and makes you go for more, it is scary how fast i am going through this bottle, this 22oz is almost gone in just a few min and i havent even been trying or paying attention, i just cant stop drinking it,wow."
"Another solid DIPA from FFF, as crazy as that sounds. Not amazing, but very good."
"Edit: Not quite there on the mouthfeel, but close. Overall, this reminds me of a dumbed down version of Moylan's Doublander and Maharaja."
"The taste shows a marked difference from its brewery-mate. Whereas Dreadnaught has a heavy accent on fruit flavors and builds its hop presence on a sturdy malt backbone, APW is unapologetic about its hop fundamentalism. Right out of the chute, it hits you with lemongrass, onion, mint and a hefty pine flavor. There's a bit of biscuity malt and grapefruit sweetness that comes in to keep things from getting too insane, but then the intense bitterness reestablishes itself at the end. The finish also shows a bit more of its alcohol than Dreadnaught. Overall this beer has the goods to fulfill your lupulin needs and is well worth your time. I know it's sacriligeous to say, but I prefer more malt depth to my DIPAs (think Dreadnaught, Abrasive and Dorado)."
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, and I'm left very, very impressed. A beautifully assembled beer."
"For comparisons sake I think its a slightly thinner & less sticky, but more well balanced variant of Dreadnaught, which I love, but I prefer this one - hopefully they make it more often! YUM YUM YUM!"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is piney and orange hops. The flavor is more of the same with the orange citrus notes standing out more than the pine. I also get some caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I got this in trade with jdefont. I split it with friend on 7/4. It pours a rich orange with a full white sticky head. Lots of sweet citrus on the nose. The flavor starts with orange marmalade, hints of citrus and pine. Definitely a sweeter brew. The finish mellows out with just enough bitterness for balance, and the slightes hint of alcohol. A full bodied brew with a sticky mouthfeel. A very good DIPA, definitely worth seeking out."
"Wow, Three Floyds hit another hoppy home run out of the park with this DIPA, which was just dripping with well balanced lush flavors and an overall good drinkibility on it for the size. I just can't get enough of the hopped-up beers from these guys. Great stuff!"
"This is your standard """very good""" IIPA/IPA. A good dose of hops, but not too much. A little malt...but second tier to the hops. It plays straight down the middle...and it is """very good""". Is it great? Nah."
"Overall, If I was forced to choose between this and Dreadnaught, I'd have to pick Dreadnaught but this was a damn good runner up."
"D - It's more balanced than the hop bombs I'm used to, but it is drinkable. There are nice tropical flavors and scents, and very balanced. The alcohol is hidden very well."
"Ample carbonation tingles on the tongue and makes me recoil. This is perfect for a double IPA. The texture is sticky and the consistency medium. I would say this is pretty much spot on. The apricot really has me sold. I wish I had better access to this beer."
"D - This really is a very good DIPA. I'm wavering in my opinion here, and I must confess, I find myself comparing directly to Dreadnaught. Dreadnaught is a major favorite of mine, so it is a tough battle, but the APW holds up well. It is a bit different, I find this more citrusy and a bit more syrupy than Dreadnaught...gonna have to search out a fresh Dreadnaught to do a side by side to be sure though. 9.0% makes it tough to drink a lot of, but that is really the only detractor for me. This is a very good DIPA...I could drink one of these every night for a little while and be happy."
"D - I'd still prefer Dreadnaught as the 2 cost the same. But still would be a very adequate substitute. A good change up with a lot of hops flavor. After hearing about this beer I'd still buy a bottle to share with some friends!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice hoppy beer. It's a pretty big beer at 9% though, and at times it felt like it too. Overall it was very good though."
"Drinkability -- There's certainly some commonality between this and Dreadnaught, but this is less tropical fruit dominant and more pine. All in all, I prefer Dreadnaught, but this was certainly no slouch."
"Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. It doesn't have the most unique flavor, but what it does it does very well. Highly recommended for any fan of the style."
"D - This beer is very good and even though its 9% I would like more."
"D - incredible beer here. excellent aroma with an attention grabbing transition from fruity hops to insanely bitter pine-monster. not much I would improve here."
"(D)- A solid to great DIPA with all the right flavors and characters. Crisp and refreshing particularly with the chinese takeout I had with it. A great drinker for this time of the year. Yet another solid beer from 3 Floyds."
"D: I was very excited to try this one but must say that i think dreadnaught is the superior FFF DIPA. I am definitely able to put this one back quite easy though and am very happy to have tried it"
"Overall, this is excellent, super easy to drink fruity and piney."
"A real winner from 3F's. I enjoy this a lot more than I do any of their other big, hoppy brews. Hopefully this will be produced in greater numbers later this year/next year. Track it down if you can!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and a slight stickiness on the finish."
"Another fine offering from FFF. Pours a cloudy amber straw color into my beer tasting wine glass. Smells of pine, apricot, and citrus notes with a hint of vanilla. The taste is well balanced with, the aroma coming through. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Watch out for this one, it is quite drinkable, but that alcohol content could be a killer. I recommend giving it a try, seems like Three Floyds know their IPA."
"D - The bomber got me pretty buzzed, although I finished it without a problem. This beer is dangerously drinkable, but the alcohol buzz you get will give you a little warning to stop."
"D: very impressed with this DIPA from FFF I didn't think they had it in them. I like dreadnaught but really like APW. I hope I can get my hands on more of this stuff."
"D: I wouldn't want more than the flute it was served in, but what a way to end a tasting!"
"You can definitely tell there is more kick in this beer than you average brew. 2 or 3 bombers of this would make for a great night of drinking. It's a shame this is only availbe for a short period of time each year. Better enjoy it while you can find it."
"3F knows their hops and it shows in yet another great DIPA."
"I hope that I can find some more on the shelves around here so that I can share the joy with our trading community..."
"- i haven't written a review in awhile, and this beer inspired me to do so. hopefully this beer will inspire you."
"edit: Had another bottle, this time with a bowl of Chili John's chili and it was freakin awesome, the tropical acid flavor is gone and it is just a bitter hop bomb."
"overall, this is a very good beer. however, the overpowering lemon citrus flavor and thin mouthfeel are no match for FFF's other DIPA, dreadnaught. i would definitely drink arctic panzer wolf again, but if given a choice, i would prefer a dreadnught."
"D: Good, but I don't know if I would really want more than half of a bomber."
"Hop bitterness hits like a freight train!"
"Really like this beer. "
""
"Well brewed with no off nodes or syrupiness, but it's nothing compared to their Dreadnaught."
"D - After a couple of these, I'm good to go. Although I like this one, I prefer Dreadnaught. That said, it's nice to have another DIPA on-tap to choose from when you don't want Dreadnaught."
"Poured a bright orange with a bit of hazy and a nice white head. Smells of grapefruit, citrus, and pine with a little bit of malt sweetness. The taste was of intense bitterness with plenty of citrus hops coming through. A little bit of alcohol heat in the taste, bringing down the mouthfeel a little bit, but still pairing fairly well with the hoppy dryness. Good drinkability for a beer this bitter. Surprise, surprise, another very solid hoppy offering from FFF."
"An excellent DIPA from Three Floyds. It's on the level with Dreadnaught and worth seeking out."
"I would describe this as a 50/50 blend of Three Floyds' Broodo and their infamous Dreadnaught."
"Overall, I think this is a wet dream for some hop heads, but to me, it's a bit out of whack. Makes me appreciate Pliny that much more!"
"I love you, I hate you, and now I'm going to take my pants off."
"I sampled this one on two separate visits. This review is considered back to back after a tulip of Dreadnaught. It pours a hazy light peach amber color with a huge foamy off white head that resists fading and leaves spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is aggressive and the fruity pineapple, peach and tangerine aroma is mirrored in the taste. Medium tangy body and creamy mouth feel enhance the drinkability. Full flavored, the fruity pineapple peach tangerine hoppiness was worth the trip!! I could drink these all afternoon. Highly Recommended."
"Thanks to my buddy for picking this one up. It's tremendous, giving Dreadnaught and Apocalypse Cow runs for their money. It's a beautiful amber/copper color with decent head/retention. Smell and taste are both FFF DIPA-esque, with big grapefruit notes. This one deviates a little with some more piney hops as well. Taste here is a bit more bitter than the other FFF DIPAs, but it's tremendous. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, perfect for this one. Drinkability is scary with the ABV and how good this one is. A must buy."
"D: Another in an impressive line-up of DIPA's from FFF. The well hidden alcohol made this damn near gulp-able. It's that scary good...really!"
"I had this the other day over at FFF on tap. It's a very expensive pale ale ($7 a snifter). I had to try it since I make it a point to always try something new when I'm there. It had a nice, hoppyness to it, typical piney smell. Good golden color, Three Floyds did not let anyone down here. It's got that kick in the ass that all their beers have, not for the weak of heart! While I enjoyed this immensely, I would not get it again when their Dreadnaught IPA is always on tap for $2 less. Honestly, the Dreadnaught is stronger and has much more hoppy bang for the buck than this."
"Tastes the same, is super refreshing and has a nice tropical nature to it. This is another powerful, almost overwhelming FFF DIPA. There's too much alcohol to be considered easily drinkable, but the one glass I had was incredible."
"Drinkability- This brew is scary drinkable for 9% and an entire growler sitting next to me. I wouldn't say it's as good as Dreadnaught but its somewhere along those lines. So fruity and easy drinking, great stuff. Thanks much Alex!"
"D - Where'd the glass go? Seriously delicious, what else can I say"
"FFF's secret weapon, arctic panzer wolf is on the prowl..."
"D - Not as insanely drinkable as Dreadnaught but still pretty enjoyable. I'd have a tough time with a growler of this stuff, but a few pours is definitely possible."
"Rich copper color with a reasonable white head. The smell was the best. Definitely lots of citrus hop aroma, and at a certain point, the smell took on a grapefruit/candy note that was very specific but I could not place. The taste was a assertively bitter with malty sweetness present. The mouthfeel was a touch syrupy, but not heavy and certainly enjoyable. Drinkability was good, but its a 9%, very bitter beer, so it can only be so good."
