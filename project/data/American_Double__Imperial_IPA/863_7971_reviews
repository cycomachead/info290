"Great beer, could drink it all day."

"If this beer had a vagina I'd definitely have sexual relations with it! I'm seriously considering divorcing the wife and starting a new life with Pliny the Elder.  I want to make babies with this beer and pick out window treatments on a Sunday while the big game is on and you know what I don't care about missing the game because I'm in love! And if you can't respect that then Gtfoh!!"
"my near-perfect rating just reflects  the fact that despite how good a beer is, it can always be made better (i'm looking at you, craft breweries worldwide -- are you up to the challenge?!)"

"I never want to die after tasting this glorious brew. IPA for life!"

"Again, not the biggest IPA fan, but this is tasty. Had it from bottle and tap, tap is the way to go."

"This beer is remarkably assembled. I find it downright soft and buoyant, and there's nothing out of balance. Sadly, though, I find the lack of seams and absence of powerful flavors a bit disappointing. It lacks character, even though I appreciate just how technically sound it is. It's like listening to finely filtered Kenny G piped into an art gallery instead of John Coltrane live. I might pick up that album and listen again and again to marvel at the technique, but I'd really rather be in the smoke and sweat of a jazz club, even if going back means it won't ever be the same twice."

"Pliney the Younger's """older brother", available year round and in bottles / growlers.  Very hoppy and strong.  By far, Russian River's most popular brew.  Weird thing is, the Elder and the Younger are two very different brews.  The Younger is not the Elder only more so, if that makes any sense."

"Exceptional IPA, indeed sets the standard.  Hoppy goodness flowing throughout bottle and the citrus crushes any alcohol taste. Definitely wanted more as soon as I was done."

"this @gregspeakshismind is total RUBBISH!!!! He chugs his craft beer?? Do not take a young boy like himself serious. Just had this TODAY, the smell is grand, taste, look, and when slightly chilled, it's fantastic. Overall very satisfied with this craft beer.Do no listen to him and report him if you can, he only writes negative reviews. Gregspeakshismind, stick to naty ice if you love beer bonging so much, little boy. LMFAO."

"One of my fraternity pledges from California brought a bottle of this back after spring break... I bonged it to the dome and yacked everywhere. Honestly it felt better coming up than going down. Never again will I drink this weak shit."

"Its really an awesome beer :)"
"Another meh IPA in the world of IPAs.  Nothing to see here, move along."

"The most balanced DIPA I have had but didn't live up to the hype for me. But overall very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is exceptional."
"Perfect dipa worth every hype. So glad I can access it easily"
""
""
""
"Art in a glass.   Great beer makes me slow down and savor every sip.  I didn't want this one to end"
"The best IPA ever. PERIOD"
""
""

"I have been looking for this beer for awhile and I will say....it did not fail to meet its hype. Great smell! And even better taste.....we'll played Russian River Brewing Company."
""

""
""
""
"It's okay but not what I was hoping for with all these high ratings"
"one of the most tasty DIPA ever!"
"as good as advertised .very hoppy but well rounded and smooth finish"
""
"Long wait to get it, but easily the smoothest I PA I've ever had. Kinda miss the East Coast bite."
""
""
"Overall - A very good ale but I'm not sure that I understand all the hype. Also, is it just me or does Elder seem to taste an awful lot like Blind Pig?"
""
""
""
"This is a great beer but it was hyped up so much that I feared it wouldn't live up to my expectations. It partially did; great initial flavor, color and smell but it fell flat at the end, it was missing something. After being around heady topper, dinner and lunch all my life this beer did not live up to its reputation. I would definitely get it again if I had the chance but if I had all the others to choose from, I would go with any of  those."
""
""
""
""
"Its as good as its reputation.  I prefer the elder over the younger."

"33 days old. I'm told its better younger. That smell though... I'd wear it as cologne if I could."

"One of the Best IPA's on the market. hands down."
"Finally had my first draft of Pliny; damn it was good!!"
""
""
""
""

"Best on draft at Russian River but wouldn't kick a bottle out of bed.....wait.  Fantastic beer.  Pliny and HT tied for best DIPA in my book."

"This is the only beer I would wait in line 6 hours to have! It's so smooth"
"Aromatic and full bodied. Smooth hoppy finish with some floral aroma. Just an all around great imperial IPA"
""
""
""
"It was ok, for a west cost beer it mostly hopped with a piney hop flavor and medium body, i would not rate it higher than a lot of other very good Double IPA's but its still an ok beer."
""
""
"Respectable beer! Just has a nutty flavor/aftertaste that I'm not crazy about"
""
"Thank-you to my future son-in-law for bringing this from CA to NY for a little gift. Actually a big gift. Born on 02/10/15 and savored on 03/10/15. This beer has earned all the top ratings this beer has gathered. My pour produced a slightly larger head than I was expecting but I think it was my fault as I wanted to get right to it. Turned out well as all the best aromas of a top-notch DIPA were released. Taste is (I'm writing as I savor) is superb. Though now on my """got""" list it remains on my """want""" list as in want more. Nicely done Russian River Brewing Co."
""
""
""
"I may have had a bad keg of this but it really disappointed. I did not detect any aroma from my beer and there was no hop flavor to speak of."
"Thanks to @villagetaps for the hook up."
""
""
""
"O: Incredibly well balanced variant on a naturally unbalanced style. Great combination of hop varieties to create a great, well rounded flavor."
"Definitely lived up to the hype, but right behind Pipeworks Square Grouper and Sure Bet."

"Great beer, but something about Blind Pig makes me choose it over Pliny"
"Best looking beer I've ever drank."
""
""
""
"No re-inventing the wheel on this review - this beer is outstanding on every count - manged to consume about 10 bottles over the last month and I have to say this is just about the best beer I've ever had. It deserves all the accolades it receives."

"O-Great beer.  To be honest, and I am sorry for even writing this as I cringe at the beer snobbery, but this ain't got nothin on Heady.  Sorry, my east coast roots, love a good west coast IPA, but Heady Topper is still carved our in my heart.  Thank you Russian River for making the journey worthwhile of the beer that followed it.  I highly recommend."

"On tap at Beechwood BBQ. Lots of hype for Pliny. Got citrus, roasty, spruce. Excellent!"

"Bottled 2/4/15. Poured into a 6 ounce stemless wine glass. Vigin-white-bridesmaid-dress head forms on top of an a.a.milne-Winnie-the-poo-colored honey base. The lace transcribed into Wachowski-bros-Matrix-title-sequence-like movement frozen into a Pangea by a Zack Morris timeout. The smell is starfruit and pomegranate mixed with a freshly opened pack of Upper Deck baseball cards. A perfect West Coast hop/malt balance that rolls over the tongue; can only be described as sitting in the back car of a rollercoaster being whiplashed over the apex, with a new year's champagne/light almond oil finish. Overall, it's the equivalent of hugging my dog after a bad day at work."
"What more us there to say.... One of the best!!"
""
"This is my favorite beer and I would drink it every week if I could. Just amazing."
""
""
"Tasty, but not as smooth and flavorful as Blind Pig and underwhelming (only because of the astronomically high expectations.)"
""
"Bottle received in a recent trade, dated 1/28/15. Poured into snifter. Nice nose on this one, poured to a one finger head that laced well. Expectations were through the roof, and though I really enjoyed the beer (I have to admit I was expecting a """5"" here), it wasn't quite everything I hoped for.  That being said and to no one's surprise, it was a terrific IPA. Smooth and pretty delicious. Just not the best beer I've ever had."
"Heavenly...it really does live up to the hype..."

"A masterpiece. Lucky to have it on tap in Philly year round."

"Perfect mix of bitter/citrus flavor"
"Wow. I can't believe I'm about to write this. I've never felt like a 'beer snob', but WOW. I feel so misled. Being from Vermont, where massive IPA's are de rigueur, I totally expected more based on ratings and reviews. I obtained my sample(s), via trade. They are very fresh (less than 2 weeks). They arrived well packed and cold, so I don't think mishandling is involved. My first impression: this is such an average feeling DIPA in 2015. Sean Lawson was brewing this same beer a decade ago in his shed. It is relatively clean, smooth and true to IPA form.  But that standard sailed a half decade ago, at least in New England. Five years ago I might have been blown away. Today? I am sadly unimpressed. I am  dismayed at how this is perceived by the public."
""
""
"This brew is a masterpiece of balance for the palate."
""
""
"On tap in Philly - amazing!"
""
""
""
"Purely tastes like grapefruit. Hop, hop, hoppie. But many wish they could brew this beer. Many Pliny clones are brewed."
""
"Poured sideways into an IPA spiegalau. Heavy amount of head with constant bubble trails to the surface. SRM of ~15 , amber in color though slightly darker than expected. Lattice work formed along the sides with consumption. About 1/4""" to 1/3""" of resurgent head consistently formed upon agitation. Smell was incredible, with an overall pungent floral smell with obvious hops and pine. Taste was a fresh, crisp fruity tartness, reminiscent of grapefruit. Perfectly astringent, with a slight but not overpowering pucker. Finish was a slow build of bitterness that progressed, but finished asymptotically smooth. Definite presence of pine and resin. Mouthfeel was medium, with some definite body though counterbalanced by its refreshing taste. Overall, probably my favorite beer as of now, and anyone who is interested in hoppy beers ought to try this!"
"Still not as good as all the hype."
"Pours a clear golden apricot. Two fingers white head that reduces to foam leaving awesome lacing. Medium mouthfeel with aromas of tropical fruits and pine. There is a reason this is a top 10 beer."
""
"It is the standard by which I judge all others."
""
""
"This beer is my new IPA favorite over Dogfish Head's 60min.  Amazingly well balanced floral notes, sweetness with bitterness.  The upfront bitters are subdued with only a slight reminder that you just took a sip of a delicious fruity, piney, crisp, and sparkling golden IPA."
"The excellent piney, citrus nose is the high point for me with this beer. The very good flavor is a bit subtler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Phenomenal IPA and I don't even really like IPAs. The nose is incredible with hints of citrus and other fruit. The taste is spectacular and the mouthfeel is on point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It lived up to the hype. It made me realize how over hoped some beers can be nowadays.  It had hops but yet so drinkable."
"The best beer on the planet!"
""
"Finally found it on tap at Hamilton's on a recent trip to the SanDiego.  It was dark and busy so my review of this and a few other beers will be a little lighter than usual.  Overall an outstanding DIPA which lives up to the hype.  I will seek this out whenever I can.  As with the Heady Topper I acquired a little while ago, I have a hard time saying it is the best beer I ever had, but if I was condemned to only drink this for the rest of my life, I would die very happy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a clear golden apricot with two fingers of white head. It reduces to foam, leaving heavy lacing. Loads of citrus, tropical fruits and pine in the aroma. There's plenty of piney hops, but it's nicely balanced with grapefruit, mango and pineapple. There's enough malt to give it a nice creaminess. Medium mouth with a touch of lingering bitterness. This certainly lives up to its reputation. Being Valentine's Day, it reminds me of my wife: Close to perfection and better than I deserve."
"It goes down well balanced without a spicy kick or unevenly bitter aftertaste. The brew leaves a budding floral aroma and almost a subtle hint of toasted pine and pistachio nuts"

""
""

""
"This is one of those beers that truely lives up to the hype. I cannot think of another American Double Imperial IPA that has a crisper more satisfying and full bodied taste than PTE."
""
"Such a great beer, it really is one of the best and if you never had a DIPA before this is probably the best one to start with."
""
""

"Had it on bottle once had it on tap yesterday with my y oungers it was all awsome."

"Www.substrand.com I have posted an article on Pliny. Check it out"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -    This ranks as one of, if the the best DIPA I have ever had.  After every sip until the very end, as the beer settled back into the glass, a wave of carbonation erupted into new foam that only improved the head in my glass. I have never had a beer do that before.  What a treat! The good news is I have another pint to try.  A beer that surely lives up to the hype.  Too bad we can't get it on the East Coast regularly."
""
""
""
"Fricking unreal..hoppy aroma to no end flavor of grassy hops and mango. Best ever."
""
""
"I mean...there really doesn't exist a better DIPA"
""
"Picked this up at Tahoe Central Market in Kings Beach Lake Tahoe. As usual, GREAT!"
""
""
"I went to a local restaurant looking for a good IPA and I winded up getting the most delicious beer I have ever tasted. They offered me a tasting of it (they had just gotten it on tap that day) and I fell in love. I got a full pint and I was in beer heaven. Everything about this beer is delicious and it has a great finish. If you like IPA's then this beer is perfect for you."
""
""
"The pinnacle of beerdom. Sorry other 49 states."
""
"O: Definitely deserves all the accolades especially when consumed at the brewery. Bought a case to take with me. The first one consumed the next day tasted just as good as it did on tap, but I noticed my enjoyment slowly diminish with each one. Took about 3 or 4 weeks to drink all of them. Again, kind of a no brainer, but try to drink as fresh as possible. Some IPAs can sit a few weeks and you hardly notice a difference in taste. This is not one of them. Pliny will still taste great within a month or so, but this is definitely not one to save for a special occasion."
""
""
""
""
"Got caught up in the hype.   It's good but not in my top 5.  Has a dry bite to it.  I still like it though."
"Another great double IPA. It is shipped as far east as Philadelphia which is still a drive but well worth it when it's in stock."
"O: One of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of dissecting, it wasn't easy and I still don't think I fully accomplished it. Dry, palate cleansing, each sip prepares you for the next. Thanks so much to Brandon for this opportunity, I'm so glad I picked up more than one. Cheers!"

"Damn!!!! Speechless.  A perfect balance.  Double ipa nirvana.  Why can't this beer be available in maine?!"
""
""
"Perfect IPA. From start to finish its a hoppy citrus followed by pine w the perfect amount of limited malt."
"One of the best there is. Piney, citrusy, beautifully balanced."

""
""
"Really nice IPA, had this amazingly fresh.  Not sure about it being the best thing ever, but definitely worth finding and trying."

"These days though it's not terribly difficult to find competing brews at several places in CA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a very well balanced IPA.  It doesn't leave that very bitter taste in your mouth as you drink it."
""
"Poured into a tulip glass from the 1-14-15 bottling.  Bright light orange reminiscent of cider given the clarity.  Finger of off-white head that dissipates gradually.  Nose brings an explosion of orange marmalade and pine.  The first sip brings orange to the fore followed by huge pine - tastes like I'm chewing a cud of pine needles.  Flavor is more bitter than many of the IPAs rolling out of CA these days, which is nothing but a good thing.  There is a reason this beer is a standard bearer."

"Perfect balance of malt character with a beautiful dank, resin, citrus hop flavor. Best IIPA IVE EVER HAD."
""
"Incredibly consistent IPA, always awesome"
""
"Very unique complex profile...have only had this on draft and never in a bottle... if blindfolded, you could pick this one out of any number of IPAs/DIPAs, which is a good thing!  Potent ABV... They went for it with this and hit a home run..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent example of the style. Well balanced bittering and flavoring hops, with good complexity. That tar/plastic character is unfortunate."

"Glass- 20oz craft pub glass"
""
""
"This is a good all around IPA/DIPA. I was lucky enough to give it a try last night and can't complain. Great aroma, nice color, feel... well balanced... almost perfection. Flavor is the only issue. It seems watered down in comparison to what I'm used to drinking - all the AIPA flavors are there, but it's all very subtle. Nothing overpowers, which is good, but when I grab an IPA, I'm looking for that hoppy wow factor and this just doesn't have it. That may be why it's so appealing to others, and if I wasn't big on IPAs, I'd probably make this my first choice. I think in the category of beer (in general), this is definitely a 5; but in the DIPA category, it's lacking...."

""
""
"Well, we meet at long last.  5,527 current wants for this bad boy.  Hype is an understatement for what this thing is all about.  As I sit here and enjoy this one, one word keeps coming to me: flawless.  This beer did not cause me to stand up and cheer, nothing crazy in terms of smell or taste, but it is absolutely flawless in its delivery.  Looks exactly the way a IIPA should, nice beautiful golden with a small head.  Smells are west coast 101--pine and grapefruits.  Bitter as hell on the palate, but the balance is incredible, leaves you dry and ready for another sip.  So glad I had this beer.  Would I go crazy to get it again?  No, probably not.  But when it comes to a perfect representation of this style, yup Pliny is where its at all day!"
"One of my favorite IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"the look of it overall is basic but thats the only basic part of this beer.  Got it in a trade today and have to say it is better than the heady topper that i traded for it.  Hands down the bees knees!"
""
"It doesn't get much better than this."
""
"There are much better DIPA's out there to be had, so if you don't manage to get your hands on this don't fret; drink a brown shugga and you're not missing much."
""
""
""
"Very refreshing and always pleasant, had one that was 3 1/2 months old and the hops still held up to fresher bottles I've had.There's not much to say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Not as good as Zombie Dust, or Myrcenary, but much better than Heady."
"Piny/flowery hop.  Not my favorite hop flavor."
""
""
""
"The beer is perfect. Not much left to say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops through and through. Wonderful Pitney, grassy, herbal deliciousness."
"Was very underwhelmed by this. Didn't have that Hop punch you get from a lot of Imperial IPAs. Pretty watery and thin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was actually pretty underwhelmed by my first. Had Heady, Mastermind, Sip of Sunshine, and Abner back in October, and this just felt inferior. Much less balanced than the latter, and had lost some of its flavor on the journey from CA to NJ. Still a delightful DIPA. Maybe my next one will feel different."
"Month old bottle brought back from a friend who was in LA. everything about this beer was perfect. Now I know what all the fuss is about. Can't wait to get this one again."
""
""
"Finally my lips had the mind- blowing honor to gulp this prestige IPA... Pliny the elder gents !!! Within seconds of popping the cap off the bottle you can already notice and admire it's freshness. Oi!!! Don't linger to long with the aroma, go ahead take a swig mate, it's just like sucking on the majestic nectar out of Gaia's bosom. Complete piney crisp flavors whirling down your throat with a memorable hoppy finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had a hard time finding it on my trip back home to the Bay, but got a few bottles. Bottled date was just 1 day old when I finally found it. It's a very good Double IPA, but I don't think it lived up to the hype of a 100-rated beer."
""
""
"Heady is better but this is great"
""
""
""
""
""
"best DIPA going....Only thing better is Pliny the Younger, Fed 6th 2015 can't get here fast enough."
""
"Bottled on 12/08/14. Previous bottles have been more memorable. Aroma has always been its strength, in my opinion. Not quite as present this time around.Still, judge for yourself and try this excellent beer."
""
"Hop bomb, this lives up to the hype. Glad I'm in California, makes it pretty easy to find it on tap or bottles."
""
""
""
""
"From a bottle.  Poured a clear but golden yellow with thin white head that quickly dissipated.  Aromas of hops with pine.  Taste strong hops with malt and sugar sweetness which cuts the bitterness.  Smooth hop aftertaste with no bitter bite back.  Light and carbonated in the mouth.  Little chewy for an IPA but it is a DIPA.  Big time hop bomb.  Very balanced and smooth.  Not sure it lived up to the hype though.  ."
"What I like most about this beer is the smell.  It smells like no other beer I have had.  I feel like I am the forest.   Than I take a nice long sip and my taste buds come alive.  A very nice crisp taste.  This is beer to me is one of the more drinkable beers I have had (it tastes so good I don't want to stop drinking them)."
""
""
"Overall: Very good super aromatic DIPA. A hop bomb, but plenty of balance and body, like being served hops on a fluffy pillow. I think the deliciousness matches the hype."
""
""
""
"Def. a world class IPA"
"The standard for over hyped California beers. Not that it's bad. Just really boring."
""
""
""
"Wow. Just wow. Meets all expectations."
""
"Acquired in trade with Zach. The highlight for me is the explosive hop aroma. Grapefruit, peach, pineapple, and tropical fruit. The taste is grapefruit, citrus with a pleasantly bitter hop aftertaste. Definitely a must try."
""
""
"Great but a little over hyped and priced.  Great value at the brewery esp. on Sunday but quite pricey to bring home.  I will try to find the Younger this year, but I have had a number of IPA's that hold up well to the Elder.   I enjoyed it and will enjoy the last three bottles but not sure if the all of the hype is well founded.  Living in Northern CA,  great IPA's are not in short supply especially if you can go fill a growler."

"Giving it a second try. Smells pretty hoppy. Initial taste is pretty hoppy and very alcoholic. The alcohol gets hidden after a while. A great aftertaste of nuts, grapefruit, and pine"
""
""
"Over rated.  Not their best by far."
"Great IIPA. Deserves the hype. Less fruity with more bitterness/grass than Heady, but personally I prefer Blind Pig over this, and this over Heady."
"O: looks better then heady, smells better,  but heady is the best tasting I've had. Pliny isn't a juicy has a bit more of a bitter bite."
""
"Poured into a Stella Challice beer glass.  Aesthetics are all there and the aroma of hops just blasts out of the glass.  Beautiful in your face flavors of pine needles, mint, earth and spice.  Not too bitter, just right.  Well done!  I have discovered the local delivery pattern and ritual so more to come."

"Overall: Super enjoyable for the type of beer. I have had a lot of IPA’s over the years and this one is definitely different. Its similar but not like the rest either. Its very well balanced and that is one thing I look for in the style. I think this is a very solid IPA or DIPA, it is what defines the style. Well made beer worth the hype, maybe? Worth trying, absolutely!"

"Super aromatic, hoppy floral notes. Soft, but present spiciness.  Orange/tangerine, pineapple, mango flavors. Love the dirty/danky,  woody, earthy flavors as well. Clean malt, crackery backbone puts the hops on shine! Bitterness is soft and lingering, perfect early kettle bittering. Just enough malty sweetness to balance out all the hops. Thin bodied with great carbonation that doesn't take away from all the aforementioned flavor components. Alcohol is well covered, barely any warmth detected while sipping. What can you say, it's Pliny! I've had this tons of time (2 hours away from the brewpub). Been a while since I've had. Can't believe I've waited so long. Don't wait if you don't have to. A must have, at least once! Probly the DIPA going."

"Aroma is like a pine tree. Very balanced and smooth."

""

"Thanks to dmsanchez for seeking this 15 day old bottle of Pliny to enjoy in Michigan. Creamy white head that lingers and floats on top of the golden liquid. Huge hop aroma and flavor of pine, orange and grapefruit citrus and stone fruit. Flavor follows nose. Exquisite balance. Crisp biscuity malts, finishes with just outstanding balance. Definitely one of the best IPA's I've had and totally lives up to the hype."

"if I had one word to describe this beer it would be RARE. a great ipa for sure, but not that great. after a newbie search for """the best ipa""" a store worker at whole foods here in HB suggested that if I ever found one of these get it. about six months later I finally found one at a liquor warehouse and the guy said only 1 per customer as they sell out in one day. I thought wow this is it I stumbled on the best ipa out there. Basically all the hype must be for its rarity, great color, more bitter than most especially in this price range but should be comparable to a sculpin or 90 minute."

"Pours a clear honey orange with light white head.  Smells of citrus, pine, sweet malts, a little floral.  Grassy pine, grapefruit, some barely flavor, sweet malts.  Medium carbonation and body with a smooth mouth-feel.  Nice moderate pine aftertaste.  Excellent"

"Pours a beautiful golden color with a one finger white head. The nose is fantastic. Pine, lemon, floral,  herbal, and a thin bread smell, like a cracker. The flavor is delicious. It's soft and delicate, yet extremely hoppy. This is a very dry beer, it doesn't have the sweetness that a lot of other DIPAs have nowadays. This is a very good, high quality, beer."

"I have to start out by saying I'm not enumerated buy beers just cuz they are famous nor do I particularly like IPAs, however, I have to say that this is a world class beer delicious very well balanced beer. The hops aren't overwhelming although it has a huge ibu measure. Doesn't kill the taste buds. I absolutely loved drinking this beer both at the brewery and later at my home with friends. World class! Even for a non IPA guy."

"Opens with malt and herbal, citrusy fruity hops on the nose. Pours brilliant gold with a snow white finely bubbled foam cap that persists and leaves thick lace. A big malt backbone supports luscious hop flavors, especially melon, citrus and a dash of mint on the finish.  A touch above medium body, medium carbonation. Very well balanced."
""
""
""
" Almost dough, smooth beginning with oily, wooden flavors of pine, until the hops become recognizable. In an impressive way. They deliver a fantastic grassy bitterness which gets coated up by wooden malts and pleasant, warm oak. Hops define the taste of this beer, without washing away any of the supporting, complex flavors. This allows a multi-layered depth on the palate, which results in a long, dry aftertaste, as hops take over in the end. Citrus peel, kiwi and lime add crispy, fruity hints to the hop impression, altough they don’t stand out too far on their own, but line up with the more present floral and herbal notes. The most pleasant thing about this Double-IPA is its perfect balance. While it is in fact very hoppy, nothing sticks out too much, nothing distracts from the unique complexity, very well done."
"The pine aroma was immediate and a pleasant surprise.  Spectacular citrus-hop-piney balance and like many reviewers have said, the easiest drinking DIPA in existence that I'm aware of.  The smoothness reminds me a lot of Lawson's Finest Liquids DIPAs but has even less of a bitter tickle.  It's really amazing how smooth and balanced this beer is.   I can certainly see why this is arguably the best DIPA in the world.  Well worth the effort to find and having had Heady, Lawson's and others like Trillium, Tree House and Foley Bros.; Pliny deserves its due  near the very top of everyone's list.  Just a very satisfying experience.  Loved it."

"Bottled on 10/10/14. Poured from the bottle in to a snifter on 10/26/14. I went in to it hoping for the best, but fearing disappointment due to the hype. Hype can really kill things for me. As it poured I was struck by the honey color. Beautiful. 1.5 finger white head. The aroma was very pineapple-y. I took my first sip, and was completely blown away.  Each drink afterwards somehow got better and better. The taste was a balance between pineapple-y citrus and pine hops. The finish was exquisite. Pliny is perfectly balanced in every way. This was the best beer I have ever had and is likely to remain the best."

""
""

"Golden honey in color with massive white head that leaves chunks of lace on every sip.  Citrus consumes the nose with grapefruit, orange and tangerine.  Great aroma but not as pronounced as expected.  Taste is an amazing isolation of citrus hop flavor.  Grapefruit, orange and tangerine in a wave of hop driven flavor with a perfect level of caramel sweetness to keep it in check.  Not overly bitter which allows all that hop flavor to come through.  Creamy burst in mouthfeel with a medium body that crisps up and finishes bone dry.  A showcase of hop flavor,  this is an amazing DIPA I'd love to try again."

"Bottle from Full Throttle Bottles in 2012.  Slightly cloudy, pale on pour.  Modest amount of head, with small bubbles, white colored.  Clear, pale gold, medium, creamy, white head. Strong floral and hops notes, with grapefruit and other citrus as well.  Taste is an exemplary balance of sweetness with a long bitter finish but not overpowering.  Really top notch balance.  Medium body, alcohol tones, long, long finish, medium carbonation.  Fantastic DIPA - the standard bearer."

"O = First sip was phenomenal.  Initial reaction was I liked this better than the Heady Topper I had a few weeks ago.  Subsequent tastes were not as spectacular.  Once again, I'd say it is a great beer, but over-hyped.  Plenty of great DIPAs around that I won't have to drive 2 hours to try.  Still an awesome beer though!"

"Yet, being the best beer I've had until today, it wasn't perfect. Maybe it's because of the spent in its journey to the other side of the Atlantic. The flavor and the bitterness didn't go very well. The transition was hard and it was only given by the resin notes and the hop flavor. I was hoping a bit more in this taste to mouthfeel transition."

"O: A hopbomb, the real deal. Fresh, dank hops compose the entirety of this beer. Their projected image is done well, but unfortunately, with so many other beers that also utilize such fresh hops in such quantities, the name is one of the only thing that sets this one apart from the crowd. Maybe if I had a better hop palate I'd be able to more fully appreciate what they've done, but as it is, it's just another refreshing DIPA, albeit done very well."

"Pour from tap at Stone Liberty Station (I mean, if they have it, it isn't a faux pas to order, right?). Sunny day in the bocce court revealed a gorgeous orangey-gold. Exactly the citrus, floral hop notes one hopes for in a DIPA. Pretty much the ideal hop character up front, immediate and sustained. A little alcohol on the finish with an appropriate stickiness to hold the hops until the next sip. Other reviewers with more refined palates can provide the specific hop profiles. Just get some if you can."

"Lots of hop bitterness in the taste.  Why are you even reading this review?  I cannot add anything to its reputation that has not been said before. Needless to say, it lives up to the hype."
"Better than Younger in my opinion"
"I have had Pliny about 6 or 7 times now.  Each time it blows me away how smooth it is.  While I am a fan of bitter IPAs, Pliny manages to pack a hop punch while being extremely drinkable.  Whenever I find it on tap it's a must order."

"While Pliny The Elder is certainly a Stylistically perfect beer, but it lacks any true uniqueness or excitement that makes my brain giggle (this is the best way I can describe the feeling I get when I have something truly amazing)"
""
"I have been wanting this beer for years and finally got my hands on two fresh bottles.  My first impressions of this beer  surpassed my expectations.  I have been let down by so many hyped beers (ipa's especially) like all of dogfish beers, Stone beers like Vertical epic, The abyss.....etc... This beer has upheld its long reputation.  Most IPA's have to much weird citrus, earthy bitterness,  or are to malty sweet, etc.  Pliny has all the hop flavors I enjoy like sharp citrus, grapefruit, fruity, sticky resinous  pine but all in a harmonious marriage of pale and copper malts.  As IPAs get bigger and """better""" I find that higher abv seems to equal sweeter.  Pliny is a great balance of hops and malt, not overly sweet or overly hopped."

"Anyhow, if you can find this darn evasive beer somewhere, leave your desk chair and cubicle and go get it now. It's fantastic all the way around, very dry and very complex taste profile, hops are evident and enjoyable, the beer hides its booziness pretty well too, which is nice. Just like the label says, don't sit on this beer, drink that baby right away (sub it out for your morning coffee if you have to) and remind yourself, you're a lucky sonofabitch to have even gotten ahold of a single bottle of it, LIFE'S GOOD."

"Pours straw golden in color with a foamy white head that retains nicely. Smell has huge juicy and piney hop aroma that is incredibly fresh and balanced by a sweet grainy malt aroma. Hops also dominate the taste with a equally piney and juicy citrus and fruity flavor. Hefty amount of bitterness is balanced perfectly with a big amount of sweet malt that comes off almost fruity as well. Medium bodied and super sticky lets you savor all the hops in this."

"Went to look for a certain pumpkin ale today and saw people walking out of the cooler with these! Pours a crystal clear amber with short head that leaves a bubbly slick as it dies down. Nose on this is out of control - super citric orange peel and tropical fruit mixed with a soft floral aroma. Taste is solid all the way through, you get a quick bite up front, some spice and citrus in the middle and a lingering resiny bitterness on the back end; this beer hits it all. The alcohol at 8% is barely noticeable, but does leave you with a nice warming sensation in the belly. Mouthfeel is medium with a delicate champagne like carbonation. Overall I think this is a great West Coast IIPA, but I prefer a little more malt balance, and I'd say FW Union Jack is comparable if you can't find this. I really never expected to see it anywhere so pretty stoked to have tried it!"

"I was prepared to be let down, but I was not.  As good an IPA as you will find.  Lighter and more balanced than most DIPAs.  Crisp and piney, with enough citrus to keep it bright.  It won't change your life, but it deserves the hype."

"I honestly don't get the hype behind this beer. I just had it on tap, and it didn't do anything exciting for me. Yes, it's a great DIPA, but i could say that about a dozen others as well. I'd drink it again, but not at the premium price it usually demands."

"O: A fantastic beer, though not best in show in the DIPA category. The taste is just fantastic, and it goes down light, sticky, and full of flavor. Can you imagine living close enough to the brewpub that you could get growlers or six-packs of this whenever? Man! 4.5."

"It looked great in the glass. Lighter than most of the IPAs I've been drinking later, more of a yellow then an orange and a bit hazy with a perfect head. It also smelled great. Lots of hops, some fruit and pine. The taste was the best part. It reminded me of Sucks but there was more to it with some effervescence on the tongue that was reminiscent of Heady Topper. I thought the finish was a tad bitter compared to Heady or Sip of Sunshine but fairly dry and very refreshing. In all, an excellent beer worth the hour's drive."
"Second verse, same as the first. Exceptional in everyday. Desert island beer status."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is nothing I can say that hasn't been articulated. So balanced.  Like being in a piney dream.  It will always have a special place in my heart.  Light amber color, great lacing, great  malt balance, tropical notes resonate throughout with a great pine smell and resinous taste, but not sticky and not overly dank.  I am already craving my next experience."

""
""
"I have to say that even though this is clearly a really good beer, it's not without equal. In fact, I would argue that these days it has many equals. The strong bitterness of the hop profile is a little harsh and detracts ever-so-slightly from appreciating the nuances encompassed within the rest of the experience on the palate. The huge pine notes intermingled with citrus and hints of grass and tropical fruit are wonderful when detectable, though. Also, the malt profile does the beer no favors. The slight sourdough notes and marginally excessive maltiness again detract a little from the overall experience. Frankly, my favorite part of the Pliny experience is the aroma, which is amazing and unimpeachable. I know I'm splitting hairs and will gladly acknowledge that this beer is fantastic, but I just don't think it's worth the hype."

"Perhaps all the hype surrounding this one has tainted my opinion, but I've never been one to just follow the crowd. If it didn't taste good I'm not going to pretend it did just because of the name wrapped around the bottle. With that being said, I was a little disappointed. I have another one in the fridge, so after a second taste another review is definitely in order."

"So... it pours a beautiful gold.. crystal clear.. I talk a lot about balance in the beers that I review and this one had perfect balance. Hops, grain, malt.. they finely crafted this one in every sense of the word. Head was a little light, but tight foams. Mouthfeel was very good for the hops which blended perfectly. finish was smooth. Is it the best beer in America? Um... no. Very very good, I would have it again and was able to buy a couple of bottles at a nearby store (2 bottle limit), but does it live up to the hype? Nope. The marketing strategy (and the limits on purchase) were brilliant and they have feed into the hype very well.... being from Utah it was my mission (pun intended) to find this beer and see for myself.. but honestly.. I think there must be a better beer out there somewhere (and for the styles I prefer, I have found a few).."

"Pours from the bottle a light amber color with a good amount of creamy head. A lot of people mention the pineapple nose and it's vibrant with also a heavy amount of grassy/piney aspects. The balance on this DIPA is spectacular. Great malt backbone with a bitter hop bite that keeps you coming back for more. The alcohol is well hidden, making this one of the more drinkable DIPAs out there. Heady Topper or Pliney, that's a tough choice!"

"This has been one of my favorite beers for years, never got around to giving it a real rating, before, but I absolutely love this beer.  It is the perfect double IPA.  Very strong hops, explosion of crisp flavor in the mouth, yet it never gets too heavy by the end of the glass.  Truly fantastic beer and the epitome of the style in my mind.  The look, smell, taste, crisp feel;  Its all fantastic."

I had this on my trip to the brewery while visiting San Fran.. was worth the trip up there to santa rosa.. the flight at the brewery is insane 16+ beers.. they make a lot of good stuff.. hope to get back there soon.. highly recommend trying this beer if you can get a trade for it or get up there yourself to visit."

"Acquired in a trade for Alchemist brews. Poured a clear honey/amber with a thin but attractive head. Lacing was nearly artistic. A fresh and lightly citrus scent. Lemon, orange, and pine taste, but all subtle. This beer feels light and drinkable for 8% ABV. Perfect bitterness, and possibly the best balanced brew I have experienced. My wife, who generally hates double IPAs actually enjoyed this. Truly an awesome beer, lacking only the wow factor to make it my #1."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my favorite beer. After trying heady topper, I thought I still liked this better, but after having them side by side, I have to give the nod (no pun intended) to heady for the grapefruit crisp easy finish. Still a cut above other beers though."
"Poured from bottle into RR bubble pint. Right off, this is a great looking beer. Crystal clear, nice 2 fingers of head that stick around and sticks to the glass as you sip. The nose sells this beer for me. Pine and citrus, especially grapefruit. Taste follows nose for me. Big hops, but in a very well balanced format. Not the hoppiest DIPA in the world, but it might be the most balanced and well done. Love this beer and I am not disappointed after hearing a lot of good stuff about it."
""
"Overall - 4.75: All in all, this is my second divine experience tasting a Russian River offering. Normally, I'm not an IPA fan, but the fruity blend of hops here is so excellent - it's perfectly balanced with strong, sweet malt that keeps the aggressive hop flavor in check. The aftertaste was a bit strong, but that was easily remedied with another sip. The worst part of this beer is that it will be gone soon and I'll have to wait until I can reserve another!"

"This one is harder for me to acquire now that Russian River no longer distributes to Washington state. I'm not really sure what else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said many many times over. It is a near perfect example of a west coast style double ipa. It has a huge nose of citrus, dank, and tropical fruit. Excellent bitterness level and hop flavor that matches what is expected based on the aroma. It has a low amount of body and a fairly dry finish as I believe all west coast ipas should have. The first time I tried this beer was after a day of hiking in the north cascades and it changed my life and my outlook on what an IPA should taste like. Cheers to Vinnie and the RR crew on this beer!"

"O: One of the best double IPAs I've ever tasted. I wish I lived in California so I can try it on tap or one it is released. I need to find someone that has a super fresh bottle so I can taste the difference between the beer that has been cellaring and one that has just been bottles. Now I wonder how Younger tastes like?"
"O- One of my favorite IPAs. Hard to find in the east, but luckily they distribute in the Philly area, which isnt too far from me. Hands down a must try for anyone who likes their IPAs."
""
""
"My buddy brought me back a variety of Russian River stuff from Colorado. The Pliny was by far my favorite. One of the smoothest IPAs I've ever tried. Taste was sweet and buttery, could drink this regularly if it was in Texas. If you love beer and are scared of IPA s this will spoil you. Loved it til the last drop!"
""

"Overall a big thank you to JerppyJerp for this trade, but as I expected, this brew is hyped up too much to meet my expectations, I can name 10 local brews better than Pliny, but it's a good beer, just not perfect as everyone makes it out to be."

Truly the standard of which DIPAs are compared, while others may exceed this with certain features, Pliny is well rounded at all corners and will always be in the discussion of top beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp as can be. Medium body with medium high carbonation. The tart stays on my tongue with some hop pine as the beer begins to fade after my last sip."
"O - A total knockout. Though many have come close, to date, this may be the best beer I've ever had."
""
"Had this recently on tap at Monks in philly. The server came back with it in a 16 ounce pint glass which surprised me. Smell was very piney, did not get a lot of citrus notes. Taste was very earthy and piny with a nice hop bite and quite delicious and easily quaffable. Alcohol content is completely hidden and could easily drink more of these than I should"

"Love this beer! With its fantastic west coast hoppy, estery tad sweet flavor of an imperial IPA from that region which is and can be mind-numbingly delicious. Always a faithful standby whenever on tap in the places frequented when I lived in Philly. Now that I live in TX, I truly miss RR."
"While my expectations were so high that I think they were impossible to live put too. This was a great ipa. Just about perfect combination of hops to flavor the beer. Not to overpowering bitterness and a good malt backing makes pliny stand out even to a guy who mainly drinks stouts."

"I tried this one back when I wasn't a big fan of IPA's. My brother flew a couple bottles back from a trip to California. Poured it from the bottle into tulip glasses. Poured hazy with a 1 finger head (probably poured too gently on my part out of respect). Pine and grapefruit aromas with a moderately strong piney bitterness through the sip. I appreciated it at the time as a great indication of the style, and I hope to try it again soon, now that I really enjoy IPA's."

"Overall respect for the beer and it's maker. Im always comparing all the ipa's to Pliney. The smell is subtle balanced grapefruit. Its probably a West Coast thing but I take pride of what this beer has accomplished, so it's worth it. Blind pig, supplication, consecration are my favorites from Russian river. I just wish I was alot closer. Cheers!"

"This is a perfectly executed double IPA. It's not a harsh bitter double but rather it strikes a perfect balance between ultra fresh hops and the classic west coast style while allowing your palate to taste all of the complexities. And it was not too overboard on the grapefruit. I understand why this is so highly thought of. The hops worked so well as they were all in unison. I could have drank a few of these. So crisp, clean with great hop and a malt backbone. I want another!"
""
"O- balanced and solid DIPA. Not as fresh perhaps as the hype may account for; only my second showing. On tap perhaps in the future."
""
"Or, Flying Fish Exit 16, 10."
"Not gonna give details here, just my opinion it's great, but hill farmstead double Citra, and heady topper are by far better. I would never turn.down a Pliny but after you have heady or Pliny you don't really look to aquire it as much. But. It deserves it's spot and is a great brew!"
""
"Overall: Great DIPA here. Complex nose. Straightforward taste that hits the nail on the head, including prominent hop and malt characteristics. Hops hit the tongue hard, and I like that. Very drinkable."

"MF – Smooth, medium bodied, semi-dry finish, very little bitterness in the finish (for a DIPA). 5"
""
"The best beer i have ever had so far. Poured into my Stella Artois glass. Pale Golden color with a little bit of head. Smells of the hops are not too strong and the taste of the hops are the perfect amount with the perfect amount of bitterness for a perfect beer. I long desired this beer and now i have finally have tried it. It went down smooth as well"

"No other IPA I've had comes close to these two."

"O. I really enjoy PTE and have had it several times now. I can say that it doesn't age gracefully and is best drank as fresh as possible. Very well balanced and delicious. I would drink it all the time if it was local"
"www.goodwilltasting.com"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Superbly delicious. A little hot for my liking. But definitely an excellent brew that makes this stout and porter lover want to continue searching for more hoppy and bitter treats, though few are as good as this one!"
""
""
"O: While not exactly my cup of tea, I was not dissapointed by the hype of this beers almost cult-like status. This has probably become the quintessential American IIPA and sets a great bar for others to strive for. Personally, I found it a bit on the piney side (Piney the Elder? :), and I don't think I could ever finish more than one bottle in a sitting without destroying my stomach (and did I mention, it's quite the palate wrecker), but I would certainly recommend it to others who are chasing the hop dragon. A must-have at some point for any beer aficionado. Cheers!"

"Overall impression: A wonderful treat. Definitely worth the hype. Will seek out and have again."
""
""
""
"Not going to lie...friends of mine hyped this beer up to be the second coming...I expected perfection. Although it was a VERY good beer, not worth the hype. I'd put a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed or a Stone Enjoy By up against PtE any day of the week. Would definitely buy this again but won't be so anxious for it to become available as I was the first time."
""
""
""
"O: Average. Very, very average."
"I frequent total wine on Tuesdays and Thursdays to find this beer. In the past couple of months I managed to come home with more that a few. Including other russion river beers. The worst part is having to drink it, because then you don't have any left! At a 1 bottle limit I manged to have one of these babies every week for the past 5 weeks! I love it! Arguably the best!"
""

""

"Quite possibly the best beer I have ever tried and just stating that from the hype. Always try to get my hands on a bottle for special occasions: birthday, graduations, and holidays. I recommend this to everyone I know. Opened a few weeks old bottle and poured into a tulip and saw a great 1.5 finger head form with great retention. Giving it a nice whiff you get a great scent for pine and other citrus notes. I had high expectations about this beer and after tasting it I can honestly say that they were meet. Not bitter at all very smooth and goes down at a relatively quick rate which can be a problem since its about 8%. I think the best part of this beer is that the more you drink it the more you enjoy it. It is consistently good and stays at the top of my top beers. I can't find myself to get tired of this beer and once you taste it you will see why."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Near perfectly balanced(if not perfect) DIPA. No flavor overwhelms the next. As good as it gets. If you want a perfected balanced IPA this is it."

"The only negative aspect of this beer is the volatility of the hops. The taste is perishable. If it gets too hot or exposed to sunlight, the flavor profile is damaged. I've had BAD glasses of Pliny!! Some of the more negative reviews are probably based on the fact the flavor profile was damaged. When you make a trade for Pliny, it sits in a hot truck on its trek hundreds/thousands of miles. Make no mistake, when fresh, this brew is something to behold and I still haven't had anything close."
"O: What can I say that hasn't been said? Just an epic beer that literally defines the style. When fresh it is always one of the best beers I have ever had, only surpassed by heady, the Younger, and BCBCS IMO. Can't recommend enough"
""
""
"Finally was able to trade for a few bottles and I had extremely high hopes for PtE. After pouring into the glass, beautiful golden orange brew sat in front of me. A frothy white head sat atop the beautiful liquid. Some lacing was left as the head quickly dissipated. The nose and the taste are typical of west coast IPAs. Citrusy fruit flavors swirl around the mouth. It goes down smooth and it is not overly bitter. Very flavorful and very smooth. Very pleased with this, but would still prefer Heady over this great one."
""
"Pliny is the finest beer I've ever tasted. For a 2X IPA it's as crisp and refreshing as it gets... for ANY beer. Some people say it's overhyped, which I don't agree with, but it depends on what type of beer you like. If you're an IPA fan and you think this beer is overhyped then I don't sympathize. But if IPA's aren't your thing then I can see how you might not appreciate it as much as someone like me who drinks almost exclusively IPA's. It is so perfectly balanced and smooth. Hoppy, citrusy, fresh, and perfect all come to mind every time I have a Pliny."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am lucky enough to have enjoyed Pliny countless times both in the bottle and on draught. First time was several years ago and every time I get a glass of it I take 2-3 whiffs of it before even taking a sip. That's how good this beer is. If you haven't tried it beg borrow or steal to try this one!"

"Wow!!! Finally got a bottle of this coveted ale and it definitely lives up to the hype. The pour is one of the sexiest golden copper colors I have ever seen. The head is thick, bone white, frothy and long lasting. Plus there is silky lacing for days. The nose is dank and citrusy. An abundance of grapefruit, pine, grass, mango, and tangerines abound. The mouthfeel is great but I'd actually like it to be a bit stickier. The flavor is a balanced bomb of west coast hops; taking all the notes of the nose and making them shine even more. This is mist certainly one of (if not the) best dipa I've ever had. Just wish it'd show its face in Michigan more often."

""
""
""
""
"O- Overall you can tell this is a very good beer. I don't see any major flaws I just think newer beers have passed it up. This beer is going 55 on the highway when everyone else is going 65-70. This beer is Michael Jordan playing for the wizards, yeah he's still Michael Jordan he's going to still score on you and show you he can do it but he's not what he once was. I'd certainly drink this beer again but I wouldn't search hard for it."

"I was at Russian River Brewery last week, and there isn't much to say about this beer except it is exceptional. I grew up in Escondido, California, and saw Stone grow from a roll up garage to a big, pleasant machine. Enjoy By is good, but I think Pliny the Elder is a tad better. It may be because I drink Enjoy By often, or it might be because the Pliny was fresh. These two beers are comparable, I love both of them. That is why I brought some home to Washington."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to say, being in the land of plentiful West Coast IPA's, this really is the king of the land. I just can't say anything more about Pliny that hasn't already been said. It's perfect from start to finish, and when it's gone, I'm sad. Believe the hype."

"t + o: taste follows nose as you get a burst of nice citrus followed by pine and dankness. there is an underlying sweetness from the malt that is refreshing but not cloying. the bitterness level is much lower than most current ipa's. the problem with reviewing pliny these days is it tastes like a typical west coast ipa. I would probably pick sculpin above this if blindfolded, and I can think of a few more ipa's that I like more. but here's the thing - the reason all those other ipa's taste like this is because they ALL copied this. it is the blueprint, the archetype. I think this beer along with boston ale are the two most important American beers in history. without this, no IPA's and no explosion of interest in them. so although the rest of the field has caught up, I have great respect for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Having high expectations for particular beer will affect the score you give it. Admittedly, I have seen the rating of this beer before, because it is top 5. This review might not be as high as some, but this beer, certainly belongs in the top tier of all beers. Also one of the best beers on the market for the price about $6."

"Pours a beautiful golden straw color with a huge, persistent, thick white head falling to a creamy color and leaves nice lacing behind. The nose blows your hair back with a massive hop nose dripping of pine tar and grapefruit juice as well as other sweet citrus and some bready malt. On the palate, hops, hops and more hops! Big resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus flavors with a beautiful long, dry finish of American bittering hops. Medium body and good carbonation making a clean and round brew. Overall, just a delicious brew!"

"Light amber hued with some serious haziness. I see microscopic sediment suspended within it. A minuscule layer of white foam partially covers the top. Serious Brussels lacing. Intense floral hop aroma beckons me to taste. The flavor is a nice balanced floral hop assault. It really lasts throughout the palate from front to the back and throughout the fade. The body is moderately carbonated, yet smooth and refreshing."

"Since this one is so tough to find I actually had to drive up to the brewery to try it. This is a very good beer but certainly over-hyped. Very nice aroma with definite apricot overtones. It looks and smells great but tastewise it matches up to some other great beers including Belgian macro-brews. One plus is it also tastes good a few days later from a growler."

"Opinion: Being from Oregon, I get far more than my share of West Coast IPAs. I may have had a better one at some point, but I can’t say when. I’m very fortunate to have a pretty regular supply of the stuff just two blocks from my house. Needless to say, I spoil myself on it."

"I've heard it's better in bottle, but I wasn't impressed with the draft version. good aroma and color. Taste was kind of a hop smack without much character or balance. Good mouthfeel. Way overrated, unlike the younger, which is really well balanced."

"O - I have my favorite beers but Pliny the Elder is of another breed. This is hands down the greatest beer ever created and the best dipa in the world. It's just scary good and it oozes class. The sort of world class liquid we all strive to find. I am amazed every single time I have this, and we are lucky to have such a grand offering available in the world of craft beer today. Pliny the Elder is a treat and I look forward to drinking this again soon. If you love dipa's then you must seek this one out! It's just one of those experiences everyone should have at some point. Thank you Russian River for creating and delivering such an awesome ale!"

"This beer is pure perfection in a Double IPA, the hops burst out in a perfect symphony of flavor leaving wants and needs for more on my tongue! A warm finish sets nicely in my beer belly and a desire to down endless glasses of this is set in motion! I reccomend this over any and all double's!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O I think this is a great beer in terms of the drinkability; however, I think that this beer could be a little more complex. I think this is a very pine forward beer and that the hop varietals do not offer anything aside from said pine. I would like to see some citrus or a bit more malt. Overall, this is a fine beer, albeit a bit less complex and compelling than the populace at large might assert."

"This is know my favorite beer of all time. I just found out that this was made by accident? This beer is better than the younger but not by much. Well worth the hype. I have not tried this in bottles but the draft is second to none. Phily is the Only place outside of the west coast to get it."
""
""
"o: If it's this good with nearly two months on it, what is it like fresh? Definitely one of the very best DIPAs I have had. Although the hop bite is less than some, it does not hang on and get annoying, and the pine and floral flavors make this Pliny shine."

"O - Beautifully crafted DIPA, does it live up the hype? IMO, Yes. Should people mortgage the house and sell a lung to get this? No. There are other great DIPA's out there. But this is worth taking a trip to soak in Sonoma County and all that beautiful place has to offer. Maybe trade some local beers to get this. This one will creep on you if you do not pace yourself. All in all, a great beer, that should be distributed more throughout bars and liquor stores."

"The Elder. This is a great beer from Russian River. I like the hop notes in the smell and the nice bold finish. When trying this beer with a group a newer beer drinkers (21year olds) I was told it was the best beer they had ever had. They don't have a lot of time with craft beers but I like to think they will keep trying more of them after a taste of this little number."

"Draught @ Monk’s: My first impression was """what is all the fuss about?""" So I asked our waitress if I had gotten the correct beer. She brought me another. As soon as I saw it we realized the first one was the wrong beer. They have Damnation on tap as well and mistakenly given me one of those. The Elder pours a darker golden color with about a finger of off white foam. It didn’t linger long but did leave a little lacing. The nose was huge! Lots of grapefruit and pine notes. Hard to smell the malts, but can faintly pick some up. The taste is excellent! Hops are not overpowering. Big malt body. Extremely well balanced. An extremely good beer."
""
""
""
""

"O. Bam, a dang fine ale. I'm lucky to have the opportunity to try one. Worth the hype and certainly worth the trouble. The booze is extremely well hidden, considering the ABV. This has session written all over it."

"I'll never turn one down that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is I need wiggle room for something I might taste down the road. But this lived up to its reputation. Double IPA that somehow manages to remain almost """light""" in a perfectly balanced way. Hops were more floral than bitter. Amazing."
""
"The perfect Imperial IPA. (In my opinion). The limited availability, even for Southern California, makes it more of a scavenger hunt to find it. The aroma is a dank, hoppyness that can't be beat. The taste is amazingly mouthwatering, getting better as you go. Mouth feel is a bit dry, but that's what I look for out of my beers. 5 across the board for this legend of west coast IPA's. Pay your respects to the originator."
""
"Overall: Very good, well made brew. Goes down very easy for a DIPA. Very piney and hoppy. Definetly worth seeking out and I will try to do so again. Cheers!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a very good beer. Although it tastes very similar to ither IPAs i've had. I love the smell of this beer the most. The taste is amazing with a balanced back bone of malt infused with the pine., It would probably take the list as my favorite if the fruits came through a little bit more in the taste."
""
"Wonderfully balanced but big DIPA. This is one heck of a hoppy beer. The first time I tried it a number of years ago there was nothing else like it. Still top tier. I may prefer Abner and Heady."

""
""
""
""
""
""

If i lived in an area where this was readily available i'm sure i'd drink plenty of it, though i think i may prefer Blind Pig. All that said, drinking fresh Maine Beer Co. on the east coast seems just as nice. Cheers."

"Nice straw color w/ a white two finger head. Smells of pine and faint malt. Tastes better than it smells...lots of pine and faint citrus with fantastic bitterness that manages to stay away from being over the top hoppy and dry. Alcohol is completely hidden. Very good beer that is really easy to drink but the Lagunitas Fusion 20 SF I had before this was better. Glad to have finally tried Pliny but seems overly hyped."
""
""
""
"My impressions of this beer were all good. I found this to be very dry, but not overly astringent. The hop aroma was strong and citrusy, with a light malt note to back that up. The flavor really matched the aroma well with no huge surprises. The dry finish and lack of alcohol warming makes this beer deceptively smooth and easy to drink, perhaps the most dangerous of the ones I tried. Folks not prepared for this alcohol content could put down a few of these before realizing just how strong they are! I have tried the bigger brawnier brother (Pliny the Younger) and that one takes it to the next level--more in line with a lot of the recent additions to the pantheon."

""

"After hearing so much about this DIPA, I am glad to see my experience generally agrees with all the hype. Juicy body with a sweet melon tone melds together nicely with an all-encompassing hop bitterness that nicely complements the malt components. One of the best DIPAs out there and in the league with Moylen's Hopsickle, Oskar Blues G'Knight Imperial Red, Victory's Dirtwolf, and To Øl's Overall IIPA."

"An amazing IPA. Great nose on this beer. Lots of citrus fruit. The mouth feel is good and I like the ABV at where it is at 8%. I think any higher and you would be able to taste the booze in the beer. I don't think it is as high as quality as Heady Topper or some of the Three Floyd's beer that has been out there, but still a amazing beer."

"O- A very impressive beer. I can see how it can both be overhyped as well as disappointing to some people. To be honest, my first reaction was of disappointment. But then I realized I was just mistaken as to what this beer is supposed to be. It is just meant to be a perfectly balanced IIPA and it is perhaps the best balanced and drinkable IIPA out there."
""
""
""
""
"O- Near perfection. A wonderful change from the movement toward the over the top Citrus flavors in many IPAs. The lingering aftertaste of hops really sets this apart from many other IPAs. This is a beer that I could drink all day or linger over just one glass. The hop taste I'm left with is neither overpowering nor is it fleeting and disappointing. For me, most IPAs I can only have 2 of before I feel I have """wrecked""" my palate for the evening. Having recently just had Zombie Dust, which is so smooth that you almost don't notice you're drinking a hoppy craft beer, I feel that Pliny succeeds at not being too smooth so you can still recognize the craftsmanship and hops."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is incredible, and makes me ponder moving to into its distribution area, well maybe not entirely. This is my first time trying this beer thanks to a trade I made earlier this week. This beer is crisp and flavorful. The hops in this beer work so well together. Makes me glad I have another on the way next week!"

"Overall: So hard to describe, because all the intangibles are there. Few beers carry the hops like Pliny. Lives up to the hype. A near perfect beer."
""
""
"I've sampled this beer many, many times; always very, very fresh and under optimal conditions. To start with, Pliny looks nearly as good as you could imagine in the glass. The nose is citrusy and inviting, but too tame and subtle for me. Taste follows the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice; medium-bodied and extremely smooth. Pliny is very balanced and an overall excellent beer; however, there are several IPAs I would recommend over Pliny, that are much easier to find. Good beer but don't jump through hoops to get it, and don't swallow all the hype."

"An absolutely wonderful DIPA, the demand on this beer is high. So its always a little challenging to snag this beer in a bottle, but our local craft bar has this on tap every month or so. The taste is a well balanced combination of grapefruit,oranges and lime. The smell is a piney aroma tossed in with a wonderful burst of hops. A very refreshing beer that is not too high in abv but suitable for the DIPA lover."

"The freshness that is the signature of Pliny makes a huge difference when it comes to the head of the beer and the aromatics in the scent. Beyond that, Pliny is one of the best balanced beers of this style from the start to finish. There's nothing substantially different about Pliny compared to other greats, it just does all of the little things right. I love the balance in the flavors and all of the scents that come right from a freshly poured head. Top notch."

"Poured from tap into a Russian River pint glass at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Beautiful, inch-thick, white head. Lots of tiny bubbles. On the nose, this is the definition of what great DIPAs should smell like -- textbook piney grapefruit. Great lacing & retention. On the palate, strong pine and grapefruit/citrus florals with huge hops balance well with smooth malts. Maintains head & lacing throughout. Moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and thick. Overall, a memorable experience, even if the hype was bigger than reality will allow. I drank three over the course of lunch, and could have kept going. Will definitely (hopefully) reach for this again some day."

"This is a world class beer. The pour was crystal clear with beautiful orange honey and amber tone. The head is thick on the pour and lacing near perfect throughout. Wow the smell of this beer is a balanced sweet honey pine with citrus and slight floral fruit peach notes. The bitterness and hop is there but again balanced and not overpowering. The taste hits every note from the smell and is long and yum(couldn't think of better word there). The mouthfeel is light but rich and all the taste permeates. Overall this beer is one of my most memorable. The taste and smell is one that is stuck in my head and I will be craving this beer a while to come."
"Definitely a noteworthy IPA, now I understand where the hype comes from. reminded me a bit of jai alai with a splash of green flash ipa for some reason"
""

"Truly fantastic stuff..."
"O: I can see why this beer is considered legendary. I'm under the assumption that a bottle of this sweet nectar runs for $6.50 a pop, and if that's true...I'm moving to the left coast. I'd drink a bottle of this every day if I could. Well worth the hype, and thanks to a CA connection, I can get this once a year. One of the best IPA's, DIPA's, and beers that I've ever had. If you come across it, get it and drink it soon thereafter. She's a beaut, Clark!"
"Note: Had from a bottle, not sure how old it was, but flavor didn't seem sacrificed."
""
""
"Finally! 510mL bottle. Pours a hazy amber color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Smells heavenly. The aroma is pine and grapefruit with some more citrus. Tangerine and maybe even a little peach. The taste is juicy tangerine and orange at first with some pine. Sweet grapefruit. Nice bitterness throughout. Tangerine and slightly floral at the end with a bit more pine. Very little alcohol presence and insanely drinkable. Heavy and slightly oily mouthfeel. It took me a long time to finally get to drink this and I'm so glad I did. Overall, it certainly lives up to the hype of being one of the top Imperial IPAs."

"O: I solid IPA/DIPA... not my favorite but I am late in the game to tasting it. I'm sure in its day it was one of the best of the best. While very solid, I don't see anything special about it.

"Okay. I was so psyched to try Pliny the Elder I was like a kid on Christmas morning. I was on vacation and went to the Horse Brass Pub, which is freaking amazing, and promptly ordered a pint. It is a really, really good beer but I think the hype and wait got to me. I wasn't blown away but I think that may be my fault. It is super hoppy, not much malt just the way I like my IPA's. I think my expectations were just unreasonably. I have tried it since and I think it is one of the top 5 IPA's I have ever had."
"O- overall a perfectly well crafted DIPA. Nice and bitter and dry with a huge hop presents, but is well balanced with a nice malt backbone. Great!"
"The beer pours an oranging yellow with amber highlights, kind of like a sunrise… The beer forms a big, pillowy head of rocky white bubbles that are slightly off-white. The head lasts nicely, but does mellow down from its initial height to about a half-finger’s width. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice sticky patchwork of lacing on the glass. In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any one’s bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasn’t that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPA’s slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but “pale and hoppy beer” hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPA’s, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPA’s even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I can’t wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers."

"Bottle. Pours liquid gold with light head. Aroma is citrus and pine, some tropical fruit. Taste is tart apple, bright hop, resin. So well balanced (did that need to be said?). Short, clean finish. This is an amazing beer. Need to try the Younger for comparison."

""
""

"No taste of the 8% abv and that super bitter hop bite or spice that sometimes turns your average beer drinker off to ipas, which is why I think this beer is so highly rated."

"Have had it several times, but it's my first review of it. Poured out of a bottle into Russian river pint glass. Nice frothy looking head but thinned out fairly quick. Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit, very juicy, has some pine too. Tastes like the nose. very smooth and well balanced with the malt. Dont taste any of the alcohol. Overall, I think this is a fantastic DIPA, one of the first and best of its kind. Though slightly overrated, I think the high rating reflects the fact that this came out before most of the newer solid DIPAs in its class. I definitely don't think it's a top 5 beer , or even a top 5 DIPA anymore, but I'm sure it was both of these things just a few years ago. Now that competition in the DIPA arena has gotten tighter, there are so many other worthy competitors to pliny."
"O- A masterfully done DIPA... Smooth, creamy, hopped up yet balanced and offering plenty of sweet maltiness."

"Overall- The quintessential west coast double IPA for a reason. Every hop head needs to try this at least once in their lifetime. I believe I do prefer eastern style a bit more, but this is fantastic overall. A top 10 double IPA for sure."
""
""
""
""
"I don't believe all DIPAs need to be hop bombs, not at all. But I was hoping Pliny would have a similar hop presence to some of my Vermont DIPAs. I found Pliny's hop presence to be very mild in comparison. I feel Pliny the Elder has a profile similar to some of the more mild Stone IPAs than the Vermont IPAs I drink more regularly."

"The folks at Russian River never cease to amaze me. Pliny sets the bar for all others. You could spend your remaining years searching for something better but you keep coming back. Gorgeous golden smooth pour. The hops are so intense they turn the corner and mature into a lovely malty finish. Heaven...."
""

"When you pour this beer you'll see it's very clear and has good head. The smell is like nothing you have ever smelled. It's so aromatic, citrusy and piney. The taste is very smooth and floral. This is a double IPA, but it's not bitter at all and seems to use less malt than other dipas. It's perfection in a bottle, the fresher the better it is. Don't age this beer! Drink it, then you'll spend all your time searching for more."

"O: One of the more difficult reviews I have written. I look at the pedigree and esteem that this beer has and I just don't get it. It's a great brew. Were this a single tier IPA I'd be giving it a nearly perfect rating. As is, it lacks the evocative, powerful aromatics and bracing bitterness of the really top tiered DIPA's. This one is crisp, balanced, refined and very drinkable, which isn't necessarily a good thing considering it's 8% abv. It is immaculately crafted, but I think it misses the marks for the style."

"Pours cloudy golden. Smells of flowers and green leaves. Initially tastes very light and fresh then the hops come in with weight only to quickly move to a smooth buttery taste and feel. Finishes with strong delicious hops. Pliny is fantastic fresh and is highly encouraged to be consumed shortly after bottling for maximum flavor."
"O: Well, if I lived in the bay area; this would be a staple for me. I would have it often. I like it and recommend it. I don't think it is over-hyped like Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is. This is a world-class beer!"

"Summary: Pliny The Elder was a bit more light, crisp and dry... Heady Topper was a bit more sweet, full bodied and well rounded. Had it been a little warmer, I would probably prefer Pliny... Looks like Heady by a hair in my opinion. That said, Pliny makes the perfect warm west coast DIPA!"

"An amazing IPA. Great nose on this beer. Lots of citrus fruit. The mouth feel is good and I like the ABV at where it is at 8%. I think any higher and you would be able to taste the booze in the beer. I don't think it is as high as quality as Heady Topper or some of the Three Floyd's beer that has been out there, but still a amazing beer."

"Overall: It absolutely is the most well balanced beer I've tasted to date. It's clean, refreshing, the perfect amount of bitterness, it is amazing and I couldn't wait to jump in to that second bottle. I've had Pliny now and I have had heady as well. They are pretty much neck and neck but I must admit that I enjoy Pliny a tad bit more. It's a little cleaner tasting and a tad bit more balanced. Hopefully I won't have to wait too long to get my hands on another bottle or 2."
"Overall, a very highly regarded beer that lives up to the hype. The perfect example of what a West-Coast IIPA is all about, not to mention that it is the original. If this isn't World-Class beer, I have never had it."
""
""
"Green Flash Green Bullet was literally better than Pliny. Sorry, Russian River."

""

""
""

"The end result is just right, but somehow less than the sum of its parts. I certainly enjoy Pliny, but it's never made an impression that lasts. It's an exceptionally balanced double IPA, but it's basically the same IPA everyone makes, just executed better."

"As it ages, the beer loses hop brightness (duh!) but retains its malt characteristics, and you can sense the real depth of the flavors that Russian River has built in. Even aged beyond its hops, it's a great beer."
"O: Wow... just wow. We eat with our tongue, eyes, nose, AND MIND. The reviews dont lie. The popularity dont lie. The hype is real. The quality is real. By far the best imperial IPA, no.. understatement.. the best beer I have ever had the privilege to drink."

"Bottled. Courtesy of Jim - huge thanks. Clear orange pour with a foamy white head. What sets this beer apart is the massive fresh hop aroma. Incredible. I smell pine mostly, but my wife says floral. Probably a little of both. It's the oily richness of the aroma that counts. Good solid IPA flavor. Very smooth. Bitterness balances with the massive malty backbone. Earthy finish. Warming after a few sips. Overall a wonderful double."
""
""
""
""
""
"What a beautifully brewed DIPA. Would absolutely drink again. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Bottle, poured into glass. Pours a mid-dark orange. This smelled heavenly. Tasted quite bitter but not extremely. Very hoppy and more citrusy than piney. I had 1 fresh bottle and 1 that was about 1.5 months old. They tasted the same, so I'm guessing it ages decently well to a point."
""
""
"O - Won't overtake Heady on my list, but it battles Cafe Racer 15 as my second favorite DIPA. Bitter hops and tasty, smooth malts are the strength of this beer. Not as complicated as other DIPA's, but the perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and slight malty sweetness make this an outstanding DIPA. It certainly deserves the praise it gets. I'm not sure why some people are saying that DirtWolf is better than this. It isn't!"
"Have drinkin a couple times a free weeks out of bottling and had a weird soapy taste. Drank this one less than a week from the bottling and it was amazing. Poured into a tulip glass that really let the aroma of this beer shine. Great beer. Appeals to all senses!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pliny definitely lives up to the hype. The best? Maybe. If you call yourself a beer geek you must try it."
"Poured half bottle of it gently out of the bottle into a glass., drank then follow with second half slightly warmer. Initially no head, but still it started to slowly foam up and form a slight head. Scents of pine and citrus, the way it smells is actually quite incredible because it carries on the second pour as the beer warms. First taste and there's more citrus along with some sweetness that hides a lot of hop. Balances well and is not overpowering. I could drink this everyday if not for the fact that it is a bit hard to find and the grocery stores that do carry tend to want a premium price."

"So much hype to live up with this beer and I have to say it did. The appearance was a light amber color. The smell was of citrus, with piney notes.

"Mmmmm mmm mmm. Still unbeatably balanced! Sure, there are a lot of other more EXTREME DIPA's and even IPA's out there now, but Pliny is just so damn drinkable, and consistent, every single time. It really took until the second or third time I had it to really appreciate it against all the other hoppy beers I've had. Actually, the first time I had it ON TAP, at the brewpub, was the real revelation for me. The hops are full of both citrus and pine aromas and flavors and each sip allows you to taste a different part of this beer's magnificence. And the crazy thing is that this is the THIRD-BEST Russian River beer I've tried (behind PtY and Supplication)!"

"My first encounter and it is by far the best smelling beer that I have ever came across. Thoroughly enjoyed and the hype has been validated. My simple statement: it is the epitome of any IPA and practically any beer for that matter. That is my review. I am so determined that my short review is quite adequate that I am willing to type out the minimum amount of words in order for this review to be posted. So, I am going to ramble just a bit because I feel that my first 42 words said enough to convince anyone that this beer is absolutely fantastic and should be sought after by any beer enthusiast. Most people specifically describe the appearance, taste, mouthfeel, etc., etc. My take on it is plainly simple. Find it, drink it , relish it, but you may depress over it because it's over and hard to come by."

"My favorite double IPA. Great balance of flavor between malt and hops. Aroma is nectar like and doesn't flood the senses. Awesome sweet finish that doesn't leave any bitterness. Extremely drinkable, however packs a swift punch. Best to drink after a Blind Pig."
"YES THIS BEER IS THAT GOOD! Don't let the light color full you. This beer packs a ton of flavor. Great balance of malts and hops! Nice caramel undertones. Fantastic mouth feel. Very smooth finish which makes this a very drinkable beer! Beware at 8.00% ABV it sneaks up on you. Thank you Craft Ale House in Limerick, PA for having this on tap!"

"O- its been a long time coming to try this one, the king of the DIPA's! certainly a great beer, just perfectly balanced malts and hops, classic west coast style through and through, now i can see why this is one of the most sought after beers in the world, truley a classic."

"This beer was great but in my opinion it did not live up to all the hype. It was rousing with a well done bitter, it had a malt that was one of the best I have seen but it lacked definition in the fruits. It couldn't have been prettier to look at. Not the best I have ever had but I am glad I tried it and would drink it again but I won't kill myself trying to get more. It was stronger then you might expect and I liked that. Was perfectly fresh as this was bottled on 8/16/13."
""
"While vacationing in Southern California, went to the Stone brewery in San Diego. They are the distributor for Russian River. Bottle was three weeks old. Being from Chicago, looking forward to my first taste of Pliny. Smell was okay. didn't get the pine smell others mention. Taste is best described as boring. I didn't get any hop bite or tingling or malt sweetness. Definitely easy drinking but that's not what I'm looking for in an 8.0 abv beer. Overall, glad to try but reaffirmed that there are plenty of great local (Midwest) beers to enjoy and much better West Coast options."
"Pliny the Elder pours a pale amber, lighter than expected, with a white, fluffy head that dissipates quickly. Not much lacing but that may be more because of the shaker pint it was served in. Aroma is big and fruity, lots of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. Grapefruit and pineapple hit the front of the tongue. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel can best be described as smooth, medium-light bodied with light carbonation, drinks much easier than its 8% ABV. Overall, this is one of the smoothest, easiest drinking Imperial IPAs out there. Outstanding job Russian River."
"Overall heady won but pliney was no chump... pliney looked so beatifull and smelt even better. Pliney had great carbonation a nice citrus grapefruit taste and smell.. and out of all the prickly alchohol tasting beers pliney completely destroyed them... a well balnced beer and I wouldn't mind having this beer any day of the week... out of all the beers pliney came in 3rd for me but that's because of my love affair with double jack which took second but deservingly so it is #2"
""
""
""
"Conclusion: If I were to search for something negative to say about Pliny the Elder, I'd say that the hops isn't particularly complex. I've had big IPA's with a lot more going on flavour-wise. In reality though, I know this isn't really a bad thing at all - the hops flavour is fresh and great, and thus complexity isn't going to improve the beer necessarily. I've never had an IPA before with the elegant balance and big body that Pliny has, glad I got the opportunity to do so."
""
"O - The best beer I've ever had. Wish I could drink this every day. Will buy this any time possible. Would beg on the side of the road for money to get one if I was broke. Don't miss an opportunity to drink this if one is presented to you!"

"Only down side to this beer is that the Russian River brewery is always crowded. It can take about 15 minutes for the bartender to even know you are there, but the beer is perfect (so worth the wait). They should have a better way to get a growler and get out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one beautiful DIPA. Every part of this beer pleases the senses and it manages to be a big hoppy west coast DIPA and yet still be balanced and ridiculously drinkable. A lot of craftsmanship went into this beer and you can tell. Deserves it's place on the top of American IPAs and is worth the general pain it is to find!"

"Had this on tap at The Hopyard in San Fransisco. The beer was excellent but not the best I've ever had. It was served in a room temp glass and the beer was not all that cold. I guarantee this had a negative effect on the taste. For all the hype this beer gets I have to say that there are better beers out there. Russian River makes it so difficult to get a hold of and people perceive that as being a good thing. It's not. There are better beers out there people. Love the beer, dislike the breweries tactics."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer lives up to the hype. I went to san diego with one thought in mind: find a Pliny. Since I did, I figured it was the perfect beer for my first review. Really enjoyed it, and did not find that it was too built up in my mind, which is common for the """white whale""" beers."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"I'm not the kind of guy to seek out a beer, or to wait in line for one, but if this becomes available again, I will definitely have one. It was perfect alone and when I had it with the sandwich. Definitely not my usual summer beer, and not something I'd drink every day, but I can certainly appreciate the craftmanship."

"If you are looking for a West Coat DIPA, this beer is superb. Somehow they manage to get the beer to focus almost completely on hops without it being out of balance. If they could sneak in just a little bit of counterpoint and ease off the carbonation just a touch, the beer would be perfect. Definitely worth a special trip to get your hands on this beer. Kudos to the staff at Russian River on a truly great beer."
""
""
"I was definitely not disappointed. The smell is perfect with citrus and hops galore. The taste is extremely well balanced yet very hoppy. Pliny lives up to the bill as one of the best beers on the planet."
""
""
""
"Had last night after a friend of mine brought some up to the frozen north form a wedding in Portland, OR. Poured into a Kenai River Brewing Pint and man this beer really is one of the best in the world. When something is hyped this month it is hard to really enjoy it, but this really is the standard by which all other West Coast DIPAs are judged and rightly so. It was already almost two months old, so I must say I don't think I have had the full experience, but man... The head was a little thin and the smell wasn't quite as expressive as I would have liked, but the flavor was really exactly what you want for the style, truly a hop heads dream."
""
""
""

"Never fails to blow me away. Most recently had on a trip to Amsterdam late June 2013. Was at De Bierkoning geeking out when they happen to pull some Pliny out. Felt like I had to get """approved""" to buy two bottles (rare in the U.S., imagine in Amsterdam), but passed the test. Always lives up to the allure. Drink at all costs."

"Long awaited sampling of PtE....Can't say I'm even close to signing on with all the hype. Nose was boring and non descript. Mouth feel was good, smooth and full. Taste was average at best. IMHO, not in the same league as Heady or Gandhi Bot. Just a good, not great, dipa."
"Pliny looks amazing. A perfect yellow/amber/pale orange color with half an inch of white bubbly head. It has fantastic lacing as well. Sticky globules that hang onto the sides of the tulip. Aroma is wonderful too. Very floral and sweet. I love the hop balance. Lots of orange scents, with maybe a touch of lemon zest. Very floral, reminds me of this tiny yellow flower that grows here in FL. It also has the faintest hint of pine, which I normally don't like, but seems to be done really well in this beer. But where this beer shines is really in the taste. It reminds me of Six Point's Bengali Tiger. Well balanced, hoppy/sweet combo and delicious. Pliny somehow takes this all up a notch! Everything I get from the nose, is doubled on my tongue, and in the best of ways. There is also the slightest of biscuity flavor too. Mouthfeel is simple, bubbly, very lightly creamy, and the hops do not attack my taste buds. I love this about Pliny. Most IPAs will sting your tongue with the aggressive hops. Also, this beer hides the 8% ABV extremely well; not as well as Compass from ST, but very very well. It drinks like a great single IPA."
""
"One of the best IPAs I've had. If you don't enjoy pine, this beer will let you down. Overall, the beer was just right in terms of bitterness; the balance is virtue here. The beer was a tad undercarbed for me, but smooth enough that I wish I had a few more -strictly for the sake of reviewing of course ;). This is my first beer from Russian River, and I'm excited to try more of their brews"
""
""
""
"O - It lives up to the hype. Mainly just because of the intensity of the hops in the flavor. It's not really an IPA that I feel like I can compare to anything else either, because the flavor is so distinct. Some people say it tastes like Hop Stoopid, but I get much more spiciness and intensity from this. Amazing."

"Overall: Heard all the hype, so I drove 30 minutes in pouring rain to have this on tap at Isaac Newton's in New Town, PA on August 1st which is now IPA Day for some reasons? Bad news was they limited it to one glass per person (was not loving that). Good news was the WOW factor. This beer is everything I expected it to be. Huge fruit bomb in the nose...super smooth drinkability with a variety of tropical fruits (too many to list going on here), hops, and some subtle bread notes. The hops were not at all overbearing as I sometimes find with this style of beer. The flavors were so balanced and tasty...This is without a doubt the best Double IPA I have ever had and could have easily drank this all afternoon despite the 8%. And they say the Younger is better...if that is true, I eagerly await that one to come around. Cheers!!"

"Bottle. Pours is golden with white head. Flavor is incredible hops, not overly bitter but no malts to be tasted. Really well done, clean hop taste and absolutely fantastic. One of my all-time favorite beers. The hops are really strong, but I could drink a lot of this."

"Mailed to me by a California friend, Poured into a Sam Adams glass yielded a nice head, plenty of lacing and beaucoup small bubbles for a few minutes. Color was golden, Smell was wonderful with a nice hop forward, citrusy piney character and a hint of malt flavor. Mouthfeel was a little weak, but offset by the outstanding taste which was very hop foward , pleasantly bitter and just sweet enough with a malty finish and the alcohol is hidden well. My first from Russian River which I wish were available in my area. Nice to start with one of their best. It is hard to compare to other great DIPA's but it has to be one of the most balanced DIPA's I've had. Enjoyed with jambalaya and crawfish pie, a great pairing."

"I mean I was really, really disappointed. Maybe my palette was off? I was tired and waited until the kid was in bed. I had nothing but water leading up. The pour was strange; no head. Low carbonation. It was reddish in color. It was very hoppy in flavoring in the front, but due to the low carbonation, it lacked any yeast or wheat taste, which I like. It had a strong bitter finish that I just couldn't overcome. Not as strong or spicy as Knee Deep's Simtra, which has a better flavor. Pliny wasn't worth the search or wait. Stone Enjoy By is much, much, much better. Maybe my expectations were too high; I don't know. I'm really bummed. I'm not sure how it got a 100 on ratebeer.com or a 100 on beeradvocate.com."

"solid classic orange copper color, not much head or lacing, but it was poured that way, so won't count against it this time. cold, it's good but a bit average. as it warms, it develops a very nice finish with hints of sweet malt and caramel. imagine deschutes' inversion, but a hint less bitter (shhhh . . . don't tell 'em i told ya). glad i tried it. a bit hyped, i'd say, but still deserving of a good rep. will have to check out the lacing next 5th monday - especially since everyone here is saying how awesome the head and lacing is, i feel i missed out on that aspect."

The most prominent thought that came to my mind was Balance, it was amazingly balanced with a very thorough complexity that made me think """now This is a double ipa!""" As others have stated, I could drink this till I got tipsy, it is wonderfully easy to drink, even though it packs a delicious punch!"

""

"I may have had this over a year ago when my brother brought one home from Portland, but damn I see what the hype is about. This is a double ipa with major hop flavor and nose; incredible malt backbone, with none of the sticky sweetness that typically characterizes most examples of the style. If you can get it...do it"
"Great beer, Russian River seems to have it down when it comes to 90 percent of their beers. Pliny the elder is a very smooth hoppy feel. Offers satisfaction throughout the paler providing an array of hops. Pliny the elder provides its uniqueness as well as a great beer overall!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really solid double IPA. Currently the third highest rated beer on BeerAdvocate.com, I really had to keep my expectations in check on this one as I had been trying to get my hands on a bottle ever since I became an IPA junkie about a year ago. At first it didn't really blow me away. The aroma, while pleasant, wasn't really unique or particularly outstanding in any way. The taste was similar in that it was certainly enjoyable but nothing terribly interesting or exclusive. But then the beer warmed up a bit and surprisingly revealed itself as the extremely balanced and well-made beer that it is. It's not a hop bomb like so many IPAs released today. Instead, it quietly impresses you with its subtlety and balance. Despite this, I have to admit that it does fall short of the legendary hype but through no fault of it's own. It's still a beautifully made beer that I wound never turn down and if more easily available, would be a staple in my fridge."
"From bottle. Poured into tulip. This is a great beer, but I don't understand why everyone sees this as a diamond in the rough. I work at a fine wine/craft beer store and get at least 5 calls a day asking if I have any Pliny. There are other things to get excited about. Try some new stuff."
""
""
"I know DIPA should be had within a few hours on tap, but I've had many better DIPAs that's a month or two old from the bottle. The anticipation was high due to all the hype, but in the end I was very disappointed. Maybe I should have it on tap next time I'm in CA, and will review again."

"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 510 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/27/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pineapple, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pineapple, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, pine, bread, and floral earthiness. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; but certainly not near the hype it gets."
""
"O -There is a reason this is one of top IPA's in the world! It displays a degree of complexity that's hard to duplicate. This is a beer you seek out if you have never had it or use to blow the minds of friends getting into craft beer. Just stellar!"

"A solid dipa for sure. Loads of sticky hops with piney notes, tropical fruit, and a hint of resin. Wouldn't have guessed that hop extract was used, but nonetheless it doesn't deter from what's going on here. Enough solid malt to be there and support the hops, but the hops are the star. Rich mouthfeel and spot on carbonation make this one heck of an enjoyable brew."

"After cracking open Maine Beer's MO just a couple hours earlier that was 2 weeks old, I can see now that in terms of hops and West Coast IPAs, freshness is everything and, again, while this was delicious I felt like Pliny was a little old and probably busted his hip. The MO blew it out of the water. The malts in this Pliny were definitely accentuated and the citrusy, tropical hops were not that present. I would love to get this relatively fresh so I can reassess and regrade this Titan of Industry."

"I was amazed with this beer. Having had numerous DIPAs, I expected this to be about the same. Boy was I wrong. This is absolutely the smoothest DIPA I have ever had. The hops, of course, were front and center. But it did not nearly have the usual """hop blast""" that every other DIPA I've ever had has. My wife, who tastes every beer I give her, usually makes a """scrunchy""" face over the bitterness of the DIPAs I give her to try. This one, even she said is really good. This is a phenomenal beer. If I ever get a chance to buy multiple bottles of this, I wouldn't hesitate for a second, no matter how much it costs, to buy as many bottles of this as I could."
""
"O: One of the easiest drinking DIPAs I've had. It's nothing out of the ordinary but just a finely crafted beer. Not the hop bomb I thought it would be, but it's so well balanced and the malt adds a great layer of flavor to the beer. I'd love to be able to get this on a regular basis but being from Jersey it's tough to come by."

"What a great beer! A lot softer in that hop taste than I originally thought. This beer is so smooth and drinkable it ridiculous. I give this a lampshade hat rating of 8.5 out of ten. A few of these will def. catch up with you. Cheers to Russian River, excellent beer!"

"O: It's kind of a gulper. Pliny is a little like Weihenstephaner's hefe. It's not about extremity; it's about flawlessness."

"__\|\___\||\___. --///---/...,,, xxx ::/---///-//:"
"O- This is always a treat for someone who lives in NJ. Can/bottle, I rate Heady Topper and Citra higher than Pliny, just my personal preference. But on tap, Pliny might be the best beer I've ever had. This is still an awesome beer though and worth seeking out if you're into hoppy beers. Consistently up there with the best of them."
""
""
""
"Bottle at a bottle share, and again via trade. Pours a clear light amber color with a moderate head. Nose and taste are both quite bitter and hoppy, with some amazing floral and piney elements; this was a fairly fresh bottle, so it was amazingly crisp and clean to drink. Great brew."

"O: Great beer. In my top 5 for sure. The only reason I don't give it a 5 overall is that its weight stops me from drinking it all day and makes me full at the end. Excellent drink."

"I love this beer. But I have so many better double IPAs as of late it's hard for me to rate it really high. I am a little biased I have probably had more Pliny the Elder then anyone in the Santa Cruz County area. Russian River in my opinion should be known more for their sours."

"O: I can still say this is my favorite beer. As I said in my review for Heady, the two beers are completely different animals, and are perfect in their own ways. This will always be my go-to, and IMO sets the standard for West Coast DIPAs. Well done, RR."

"Overall I'm glad I scored this beer in a trade , it really is to me the best DIPA that I have had , there are a few I think that stand down the podium from it but this is what all DIPA's should be judged by"
""
""
""
"O: This beer gets very high reviews for very good reasons. Lots of brews focus on single areas, but this one excels in all areas of the taste (the initial sweetness, the bready mid-tastes, and the hop finish.) It does all this without tasting boozy and the smell accurately represents the taste. All of this is accomplished with a mouthfeel that doesn't fatigue the drinker. In my book, this is a win; I enjoy drinking Pliny, and I'll always enjoy another."

"The flavor is very balanced. It's both bitter and sweet. Neither side is overpowering. The beer is extremely drinkable. I'm savoring it but I can see why someone would say it doesn't take long to finish a pint. I'm very happy to be getting some more next month!"

"O: 4.5 - I think that this is the third time that I've tried this beer, and unfortunately, it doesn't live up the hype for me; there are not enough hops in this one to warrant world-class status for style; I had older batches in the past but this was only bottled about two weeks ago! Anyway, I would consider this more of a single IPA anyway, and it's definitely excellent for that style; I wonder if this is one of those beers that were really great 5-10 years ago, but, now, there are much better examples"
"O - a highly rated beer that deserves all the praise it receives. I'm not a fan of sweet DIPAs and this one is far from sweet and not too dry. It's certainly a hoppy beer, but it doesn't destroy your palate. Fantastic beer!"
""
""
"This is definitely one of the best tasting IPAs I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend drinking this first and then following it up with another IPA. The second IPA wouldn't taste right. If you can get your hands on a bottle I wouldn't think twice to get it."

"the label is pretty cool. plain, and descriptive. while not really hep on the 'west coast ipas' or the ultra hoppy brews, i was a bit concerned about this even after reading all the 'legendary' reviews. i really enjoy this, however; it doesnt have the hard bitter bite and it's actually very smooth with a kind of creamy feel. i can easily drink several of these in succession, which is quite a statement as this is not even close to my preferred style. i have to give this high marks without allowing other reviews to influence me. i love the stickiness on the side of the glass and even though this is not my favorite style, i am giving this a 5 in taste because i like it and it's the only one of its style that i can say i have enjoyed. i taste no alcohol in this either...."

"O- Way to combine strong hoppiness and smoothness, Russian River. A hop-lover's wet dream, with some great malt flavors, too. I was sad when this bottle was empty, this beer has so many layers! The flavor is so saturated with hops. I had hop breath for hours after I had finished it."

"Clear orange glow with tightly laced white head. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose. Lots of tropical fruit on the palate too, mangos and pineapples. Enough malt to balance the hops along with a nice building bitterness that grows with each sip. Lot milder then expected but great flavors, not overbearing, and extremely drinkable. One of the few beers to live up to its reputation but still not my favorite DIPA."
"This was my second DIPA (had Lagunitas Maximus in bottle the prior day). Was out in the Bay Area so drove up to Santa Rosa to try it right at the source - the Russian River Brewpub. Had a pint at the bar before dinner. It was definitely unique but not something I would seek out for future drinking. For me it finished too bitter and like the other DIPA I had (Lagunitas Maximus) had a hint of something rank on hitting the tongue. Comparing the two it was definitely preferable to the Lagunitas with more interesting flavor components and a smoother mouthfeel. I ended up getting a sampler of all 15 beers they had on tap after this pint, and ended up preferring several of their other beers (Perdition, OVL Stout, almost everything except the sour ales). Obviously YMMV and if you like DIPAs I can only assume you'll love this. Thinking about my preferences, I'd take a good Bock/Eisbock/Barleywine in the cooler months and a tasty Hefeweizen/Lager in the warmer months over Pliny any day. I'd still be up for trying a pint of Younger if I am around here in February just to make sure this tasting wasn't a fluke."
"Overall: If you have any interest in the style, or beer in general, this is an absolute must-try. If only I could get this stuff in NYC."
""
"OVERALL: Elder is as advertised, but too dry and resinous for my palate."

"Overall, this beer is great. It is a bit of a legend but I don't think it's ultimately the end all be all of the DIPA's. It's a great beer that I'll have any day, but one worth the trouble of trying to find?"
""
"O - After having this multiple times, I completely understand why this beer has been the gold standard for DIPAs. There are bold hops flavors but the emphasis on balance is awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I consider this a great beer. But, personally, not my favorite."
""
""
""
"Overall: A world class beer, but for me, not worth the difficulty to obtain. I can get plenty of satisfying DIPAs for much less effort, that are almost as good."
""
""
""
"This was a great tasting smooth beer with well defined hops and a terrific aroma of honey, citrus, and grapefruit. I tried it at DLD 2013 from a generous pour while waiting in line. The beer was well carbonated and a great refreshing summer beer with hops that don't linger longer than necessary."
"O - Leaves me wishing I could sit down and drink it on tap all night. The shame is that I have to savor every drop, and think about every sip, would love to be able to just have a few pints while watching some sports at the bar. Overall excellent beer that lived up to all of the hype."

"Picked up some Pliny last week in California and was very fresh. Printed date of production was two weeks ago. There is nothing to not like about this medium bodied beer - Pours a nice golden yellow, smells woodsy/fruity, mouth feel is good with not too much carbonation and doesn't linger for a whole lot of after taste. World class, but hard to obtain here on the east coast."
""
""
""
"Golden color with medium white head. Fantastic aromatic hoppy aroma with oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, grapefruit zest, pines. Taste starts sweet fruity with oranges, tangerines, lychee, pineapples, continues with strong portion of aromatic hops. Long very hoppy bitter finish. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, I am slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's still one of the best in its style. And I agree with Vinnie (the brewer) that pale is the way to go. But this beer has a certain soapiness/oiliness that I'd prefer not to have. Also, I've been appreciating the tropical flavors that beers down south (Alesmith, Greenflash) often have, which RR doesn't seem to have."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer, and one that has slowly been moving up in my opinion. This is probably the 6th or 7th time I've had Elder, and while I wouldn't say this is my favorite (this bottle seems a little weaker in the flavor than some of the other bottles I've had), it is definitely a very good DIPA. I wish there was a little less bitterness in the aftertaste and maybe a fuller body. I feel like Younger does this right, but it is unfortunately hell to obtain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Phenomenal brew, absolutely amazing. So glad we were able to get some of this shipped out to us. Even a non-DIPA/IPA drinker and those who aren't super into hops can enjoy this smooth and unique brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, a fantastic beer. I'm not sure I can say that it's my favorite DIPA ever, but it's quite amazing in the way it has so many things going on. I have a second bottle and will have to see how that influences my perception of this stellar brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this is in my top 5 ever, maybe top 2. It is amazing and worthy of all hype that it gets."
""
""
"Overall – This beer is definitely overhyped and overrated. It is very well-balanced and holds true to its style. An excellent beer, but not nearly as incredible as I thought it might be. I feel the aroma and look of this beer may be some of its most impressive characteristics. Dry, earthy, tart, yet sugary and delicious, this beer is a great Double India Pale Ale. I think it is fairly obvious that most of the beer nerds out there like to boast of Pliny's rarity and perhaps feel extra privileged to take part in the hype. It is very hard to find and I am fortunate enough to finally get my hands on it after approximately 4 years of searching. Do not get me wrong, this is an exceptional beer in its style, but definitely overhyped due to how hard it is to come by. Also important to note: there are plenty of other amazing IPAs and DIPAs out there that rival this specific beer. Overall, this does not disappoint. Pliny, you are delicious."
""
""
"No review is really needed for this beer, but I wanted to have this listed under my review list. That said, the beer is a favorite for obvious reasons. Its balance and flavors are so good, and are still considerably unique among so many beers even after all these years. May be my favortite beer during the summer time. Such a fresh, clean flavor profile. Simcoe hops are balanced perfectly. The slight champagney mouthfeel gives you a deliciously refreshing beginning with a semi-dry finish that begs for another gulp. The smell is good, but does not represent the beers taste and overal experience. I did notice the hop smells came through more as it warmed up a bit, but this beer should be served colder them most IPA's. I recently had PTY and although it was a great beer, (basically a bigger version of elder), I think Elder is a better beer as for as craft goes."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a hop head and this beer is by far the best IPA I have ever had! Enjoyed this pint while down in Santa Rosa one day on a road trip. An explosion of citrus, floral, earthy and grassy hops. Perfectly balanced malt backbone. It doesn't get any better than this. I usually don't write reviews, but this beer gets one. Way to go Russian River!"
""
""
""
""
"This really is a great beer that doesn't disappoint. Although, I wouldn't be doing my job as a new member of the """Have enjoyed fresh Heady and Pliny""" club if I didn't opine on my preferred beverage. I prefer Heady, slightly, for a couple of reasons. First, I have history with it. I have had a lot of Heady and associate some great memories with it. I'd be lying if I didn't admit this was a factor. But second, I love Heady's viscosity, its dense, dirty look and feel, and it's substantial sweet backbone that Pliny lacks. I appreciate both, and Pliny is really spectacular, so it comes down to personal preference."

"Got this from a buddy that came back from California- thanks Jamie! I was so excited to try this beer, as I have heard all the hype. Had this in my Hill Farmstead tulip glass. Pours a nice looking pale ale with a nice head that with moderate lacing that sticks to the glass, creating nice layers with every sip. The initial aroma is floral and super hoppy, but fades quickly. The light body holds only an initial hop flavor that fades quickly as your pallet declines with the bitter bite of the hops, and the flavor just seems bland after the first 2 sips. No real complaints with this beer, except that it didn't live up to the hype. Definitely a very good beer, but I would not go out of my way to have this. 4.27/5"

"Ah, Pliny. It's been three years, but we meet at last. Pliny the Elder pours out an orange-copper color with a head that retains very well. The aroma is that of resiny hops and citrus. Pretty standard, but still well done. The taste puts any fears to rest I had of this not living up to the hype down pretty quickly. It brings in a strong grapefruit flavor at first, with some tropical flavors in the middle leading to a big, resiny, piney finish that lingers for an eternity. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Pliny the Elder is an excellent double IPA. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Poured a clearish orange gold body with monster two-finger head that died slow and left lace everywhere the whole beer. Huge hop aroma of sticky, wet, earthy hops with that familiar grapefruit and citric/clovey spice hop zip, along with some sweet or plush tropical fruit smell that is a tad noticeable and there is a touch of some caramel and/or bready malt. Beer is medium-bodied, easy to drink, incredibly smooth for the amout of hops in there and it packs a lot. Almost chewey and a dangerous session ale since you can't even pick up any alcohol, this beer is the exception of most DIPAs in that instead of crushing/drying out your tastebuds it wets them and leaves you wanting more. Not only are there the strong grape/citric hops flavors with spice but there is a sweetness to this beer that gives it nice balance and a strong, bready crackerlike malt backbone that holds everything up and what a delicious finish. For everything I heard about this beer it was definitely worth the wait."
""

"O - Outstanding beer. I would like to contrast with some fresh HT and see how it comes out. Either way it is a well executed IIPA. I would love to drink this on a regular basis. It is a must try."

"I had two on tap in Philly. Very excited when the waitress mentioned it, because like many, I thought I might never get to taste it. This beer has a golden-red, rather clear hue. A small white head. An amazing citrus smell that you know is gonna taste good, just from one sniff. Taste is very crisp, refreshing, and citrusy. Grapefruit mostly, with medium body. Could drink a lot of these in a single sitting. I still give an edge to Gandhi Bot as slightly better tasting, because as a local, I have my biases =), but I liked Pliny so much, I thought I would add to the chorus of complimentary reviews. Worth the hype in my opinion, of course I was lucky and didn't have to wait in a line or trade to get a taste, very fortunate on my part. Right bar, right time."
""
""
"Overall - Lives up to the hype. Excellent quality, smooth drinker. Can't wait to get more of this."
""
"I live a block from a bar that has this on tap and I have it at least once a week. Hands down, a fantastic beer. Just a lighter version of the Younger and less malt. Great balance of malt character and fresh hops. I'm really luck to live a block from the fountain of PtE."

"This is a very solid and extremely tasty Imperial IPA, but the best in the world? Nope. I really, really enjoyed this one, but would have preferred more bitterness and a more aggressive hop profile. That being said, a great beer and worth trying, but it's nowhere near where the hype places it. Of course, all palates are different."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: I feel the strongest part of this beer is its mouth feel. Elder is very well crafted. You cannot argue Russian River really put effort into designing and balancing Elder. There was nothing that really stood out and I was not overly impressed with the flavor which is why I forgot it so fast. There are other Doubles/imperials that are on the market that are READILY AVAILABLE that I would rather consume. I was not a fan of having to go out of my way to find and try the beer after 3 years searching. Find it (good luck) and try it. But I would not go out of the way to drink again."
""
""
""
"One of the finest beers put out by Russian River. Had it on tap at the brewery. Very hoppy aroma hits you first, drinks incredibly smooth for such a big beer. It is hard to find but well worth the hunt. If you happen to locate a bottle, or better yet find it on tap, do not pass up the opportunity to try it."
"O- the flavors of this beer lived up to the hype for me. This is the cleanest and freshest hop profile that I've experienced from a beer. The flavors are so profound yet brilliantly balanced, it drinks as easy as a standard IPA. Glad to finally have a chance to try this legend."

"Pliny The Elder is completely worthy of the legendary status it receives, and has a drinkability factor that surpasses the mighty Heady Topper for my tastes. This DIPA is a masterpiece, one that has only been matched thus far by Lawson's Double Sunshine. Excellent work by Russian River Brewing."

"Before I had a chance to have this for the first time, I was worried that it was going to be over hyped; I thought my expectations were going to be too high, and I was going to be disappointed. Nothing could be further from the truth. This beer is simply fantastic. It puts all of my other favorite DIPAs to shame. It pours a rich golden amber that is perfectly transparent, with some bubbles effervescing. It has a nice thick dense, white head with great retention and lacing. The smell is amazing: fresh pineapple, mango, hops and grapefruit. The definition of fresh. The taste follows suit: sour citrus up front, some sweet caramel and mango in the middle with some herbal hints, and resiny hops to finish it off. Absolutely no booze. Silky smooth, crisp and refreshing. This beer is simply fantastic, and considering its price point, and availability (check local listings), I would go on a limb to say it is probably the best beer overall on the planet right now."

"O – Great as always. Fantastic value, and a top notch example of the style. One of the all time greats."

"O- This is an incredible brew. Not at all what I was expecting from such a legendary beer, though the surprise is not at all unwelcome. This is definitely a brew that lives up to its hype, and one that I only hope I can get my hands on again at some point in the future."
""
"Russian River seriously needs to expand their operation."
""
"O. This beer is well balanced, but balanced rather like a Miata than a GTR. There is a lot of hop bite but the juicy tropical flavors that jump out at you in more substantial DIPAs are there to a much lesser extent and they are subdued by the carbonation. This beer would be nice served extra cold and it would pair well with buffalo wings or mexican food. I would not recommend giving it to anyone as an example of a DIPA, as there are American IPAs that are less bitter yet have more hop aroma and flavor. It is, however, very consistent. I have had dozens of PTEs and they taste similar from draft to bottle, and whether they were bottled 5 days ago or a month ago."

"O: Damn near perfect. A top 3 DIPA for sure. Probably even better fresh. I would probably drink this every day if I lived in Cali. Worth seeking out just to try, but you may be saddened after finishing it if you don't have more left."

""

"From the opening smell you know it's going to be great. We were lucky enough to have a fresh one, less than a month old, so obvious advice reigns true, if you get your hands on this guy, chill it, then drink it!!! Drank in a sifter, The taste was pine cone fresh, crisp, and clean. Perfect, perfect carbonation."

"This is not the hoppiest beer you'll ever have. It doesn't smack you over the head with it- it's balanced and wonderfully drinkable. It's pure hop essence in its most drinkable form. One of the best, as you all are sure to know by now."
"Just had my first one since I cannot get it here in Houston. I had my fiance ask her cousin in San Diego to ship some here. Overall, the best beer I've tasted so far. Smell is fantastic and taste is superb. Wish I could get PTY. I've heard it's very hard to get sometimes..."

"Aromas and taste of pine resin, white grapefruit, flowery hops, modest alcohol, black pepper, straw, grapefruit rind. All and all a very flavorful and satisfying brew"
"Made it Russian River on 1-30-13, 2 days before Younger was released, the most well balanced beer I've had, it was so dank on tap, I'm in love with it and have some being shipped to me now...thank god for friends that love beer as much as I do...trying to see if I can get to Philly to try younger..."
"O: Hard to beat- incredibly balanced for a beer that offers such a hop experience."
""
"O: I am not sure how it could get much better than this one. If it were possible to have a bunch of bottles of this laying around, it could get dangerous. It's amazingly smooth, crisp, and refreshing. I love the hop character without being very malty or bitter. I'm can sometimes be a cynic when it comes to overly hyped beers, but this one lived up to the hype."

"O...this is right on the money. It is hard to be better than this. I thaught I would be let down after finally tracking down this exceptionally rated brew but, I was not. Every bit as great as I would have hoped. I love this beer and can't wait for my next chance to drink it."
""
""
"Overall, it's an impressive beer. I'm not quite sure why it gets compared to Heady Topper so much as they're very different. Heady is hazy, resiny and just blasts you with hop aroma and taste. This is more subtle. It's about a lot of great flavors mixed together with skill and subtlety and while I could drink this one with regularity, I think the days of it being at the top of the DIPA crowd are about over."

"Had this at the Urban Tavern in the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco a few weeks ago. Very easy to drink. Hints of pine and citrus with a perfect balance. This I felt was a medium body work of art. Appearance is a fire orange. A must have if you can find it."
""
""
"I've tried several Plinys now, and not one has been bad. Great IPA. Has a great, refreshing smell to it. Pours a light white/yellow head. Very citrusy and bubbley too, also has a really clean, crisp taste. Light orange in appearance. Beautiful lacing."
""
"Wow.. my first PtE. My first thoughts were that this is a very impressive DIPA - I can see why it is ranked what it is. At the same time, it is gaining some pretty fierce competitors. First example: Lagunitas sucks, a beer with a very similar hop profile and a clear filtered character, which is more readily available and less hyped up (which is probably why it has lower ratings). Another example would by heady topper, which in a side by side test would defeat PtE in my opinion. It's raw, unfiltered character gives it the one-up on PtE. Don't get me wrong, this is an EXCELLENT DIPA worth trying and I'm jealous of those who can get it on the regzzz."
""
""
"O: glad i got to try this, im willing to trade for more."

"This experience was so good that it makes me sad that I will be moving from Philly."
"Overall its probably my favorite IPA. I just love the balance and i return to this again and again. Not overly sweet like some, not overly bitter like most, just right. With a great dry finish too. Perfect. Even though i live on the other side of the country, ive had this IPA more than a dozen different times. I just cant get enough of it and will never tire of it."

"O- Finally got my hands on this legendary brew! It's great. Not as hop forward as I was expecting but still very very hoppy considering its malt presence. Masterfully made and incredibly well balanced. This beer is worthy of it's lore and legacy."
""
""
"This beer is awesome! Stopped off on my way back from the bay to try out a pint. From the aroma, to the appearance and the flavor, this IPA has it all! I must admit, I was prepared to be a little dissappointed based upon all the hype that surrounds this beer, but it rose to the challenge. Again, the only downside I see to this beer is the fact that you can't get it easier if you aren't in the Sonoma/Surrounding bay area. Definately a favorite."
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, but I don't really see what the big deal about it is. I'd rather have a Hoptimum to be honest. The only thing I truly enjoyed was the aftertaste."

"Overall: A fresh DIPA that deserves the vast majority of the hype it gets on this site. Great drinkability, awesome complexity with its balance of bready malt sweetness and bitter hop characteristics , which is slightly skewed towards the hops. It's also a great looking beer for its class. An incredible beer that is a standard bearer for the west-coast DIPA. I have had this and Heady Topper and I can confidently say I would rather have Pliny over Heady if I could only choose one to drink for the rest of my life."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice amount of carbonation, great hoppiness without a bitter after taste. If you can get it, definitely try it. That being said don't beat yourself up to get this beer. A really good local IPA craft brew in many cities (at least on the west coast) can do something that is really just as good in my opinion. There is a lot of buzz which I think is making people over sell this beer."

"should be the goal of all brewers to come up with double ipas like this one, but to make it is expensive with all the hops needed. Good value; paid $6 for a pint. They give you the bottling date on the bottle...mine was 1/29; tasted today 2/16. Vinny says don't put it away to age or the hops will fade."
""
"To date one of the top beers that I've drank. Clarity on the beer is ridiculous, and has a great orange amber hue. Aroma to me is floral. Taste is awesome, everything a double IPA should be, bitter, piney and aggressive. What makes this beer different for me is the smoothness as well and after a lot of hops it has a very smooth and clean finish with some lingering bitterness. Overall an incredible beer that I wish was more accessible and not so difficult to get. Got a few brought back from cali from a co-worker on a business trip. Had a another friend out that way this weekend and he was having difficulty finding it. This beer gives you a great excuse to take a trip out to the bay area."
""
""
""
"O: There is a reason for the hype and the Elder definitely delivers. I enjoyed every aspect of this beer. The taste has the perfect balance of citrus fruits, pine, and bitterness. I cannot get over how much grapefruit was in the beer. It looks gorgeous and smells even better. If you haven’t had this beer yet, seek it out! You won’t be disappointed."

"But this one makes it a close second in my book. However, the taste is lacking the smoothness and the smell is lacking the freshness of Pliny the Younger. When that is said, this is a must try!"
""
""
"Overall: This is an awesome DIPA for sure. If I had regular access to this it is one that I would enjoy when I could. Is it over hyped? I would say yes but glad I was able to try it as I am throughly enjoying sipping on it."
""
""
""
""
""

"Cheers!!!"

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Worth the hype, so glad I was given the opportunity to try this beer! It met my expectations yet it was a very modest beer that just hit all the right marks. True to form, well balanced, and just a great drink."
""
"Had the pleasure of visiting RR brewery last month and Pliney did not disappoint! Just an all around great beer. Lovely huge piney scent when poured from the bottle, Excellent two finger head with great lacing, Light light golden color with huge points for clarity, and the taste...oh the taste! Super hop forward with tons of spice with a long bitter, but mellow finish. Seems like drinking hop nectar. This beer is certainly tops for West coast IPA's and really has forced me to rediscover the whole style. I'd drink this when and where ever i can find it!"
""
"He has his seriously snobby beer friends around the bar and pours each of them a taste. It was so funny to hear the gasps like they were having an orgasm...no kidding. They proclaimed that this was the best beer ever in that bar. He carries some serious Belgium Ales and microbrews on tap from around the world. It was unanimous. Blown away with the Row 2 Hill 56. They identified the unusual hop taste. I told them about the Simcoe Hop only grown in Wakima Washington by 4 families. These guys certainly know their beer."

"Overall - Overall this is a very solid dipa. I hate to be the minority when I say that I was a little disappointed. I do not feel that this beer lives upto the hype. Maybe that is because I have pretty regular access to Heady. My personal preference is for a dipa with more of a citrus taste."

"O- OK, I get it now. This shit's amazing. Not quite as stellar as Zombie Dust IMO, but it's up there. Then again, this isn't the freshest batch, so what do I know?"
""
"Overall - By far one of the best dipa's I have ever had."
"Overall- This did not disappoint at all. Way more balanced than I anticipated, and while it is immensely hoppy, it's not overpowering. Yeah, it would probably make a light beer drinker cry, but for a hophead homebrewer, this is a great reminder that a great IIPA isn't always just about tons of hops. The lack of alcohol presence, the slight malt sweetness in the finish, really round this beer out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours nice yellowish orange with nice head. Very piny smell that hits you quick. Taste is extremely smooth and hit you with a big pine taste at the end. Very nicely put together but may be a little overhyped. Still a world class beer but maybe I'm not a huge fan of that much pine taste."
""

"O- would drink many many more. Understandable on why its so highly sought after. Wishit was readily available. Hats of RR good job"

"Pliny is often compared to Heady Topper. If you stack both of them side by side, it comes to a matter of personal preference. Pliny seems to be a more refined experience, while Heady Topper is like the race gas of IPAs. But don't take my word for it! Seek out both and enjoy, then decide for yourself!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Still the standard DIPA. As the hops arm race continues, it’s a good reminder to us that we still need the all around complete version that doesn’t succumb to over-hopping or exotic varietals. Drink it, enjoy it, love it."
""
"O: Lets start with """the comparison""" heady topper is my favorite beer I like it better (I have tasted them back to back) but that being said I do not think they compare well HT is a hop bomb and Pliny is a balanced hop forward dipa for me there is a big difference and they are both great. Mad respect to Russian River this is an amazing well crafted beer lives up to the hype buy it if you can and the fresher the better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its extremely drinkable. It has a great bitter component. It finishes great on the palate. Fruity, floral, earthy and piney tones all round out a great nose and taste. Super balanced. its never too much and never, not enough. I think the hype was over done, but I do think that it is a world class brew. Drink it sooner than later."
""
"The easier to find, gentler Pliny. Great taste, STRONG like bull, awesome finish. The best way to enjoy it is AT Russian river on a hot day, followed by a dip in the waters... Plus, the guys at the brewery are awesome. If they have any of the younger, don't let it pass you by"

"Fresh in trade from IBrew2or3. Thanks! Bottled 12/27/12, drank 1/11/13. Decided to make this my 50th DIPA tried. Pours a nice golden color with one finger head. Aroma comes off this thing like heaven. Floral pine notes abound, with a zesty citrus on the nose. Thr flavor is a piney orange bite with a lot more body than I had expected. Citrus aftertaste balanced nicely with the malt backbone that still highlights that great hop flavor. Medium resiny mouthfeel. Very smooth. Hop candy for sure. Highly rated for good reason. I think there are a couple I like better in the style, but this is awesome."
""
""
""
"10 day old bottle. Pours clear copper with a finger of off-white head. Aroma is piney with notes of tropical fruit and a touch of funk. Flavor is big on pine, grapefruit and funk. Extremely refreshing while still being big on maltiness. Medium body, light carbonation and a dry finish."
""
""
"Got a chance at a bottle of this while at Martin's Gastropub in Palo Alto. They only had 14 bottles left and I hadn't tried it yet, so I snagged one. Right off the bat, I loved it. One of the best beers I'd had. This class of beers is currently my favorite class and this beer sits at the top of the class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden yellow with a decent head. Complex lacing left on the glass but head disappeared to a rim. Smells of piney hops. Taste is big piney hops, but somehow also balanced and not over the top. Citrus undertone may help to smooth the hops. Caramel sweetness up front turns to an excellent bitter bite on the back."

"Overal this is a fantastic IPA that anyone would be forunate enough to recieve and savor. However, i do believe i have to give Heady Topper the nod in my personal tasting."
"O- Probably the perfect IPA. This beer is everything an IPA should be. Super hoppy, but clearly not made without regard for the malt characteristics of the beer. The malt bill is made to support the hops fully, and the balance is perfect. If I had to have one more beer before I died, fresh Pliny the Elder would be my choice without doubt. Best beer I have ever had."

"It's been a while since I had this beer. A friend brought one back last winter when he came home snowboarding. I won't go into a lot of detail because it's been so long, just the things that stuck out. The smell was amazing! I know lots of people talk about it but it was amazing. Sooo much Simcoe. As far as the hop taste, it makes it very evident that hop profile is more than just IBU's. Definitely big on Simcoe but I suspect Columbus, Centennial and maybe Cascades. I'm sure it died off a bit as it was almost a month and a half old when I had it but this was one of the only beers I have ever had where I started writing clone notes while I was drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very drinkable, lots of delicious juicy tropical fruits, piney floral hop profile, and it leaves a great finish, not overly bitter and perfectly balanced throughout. This beer is what is meant to be, a perfectly balanced iipa that masks the alcohol completely. Reminds me of being back in Santa Rosa among the big pine trees and sweet sunshine."

""
"O: At one point this was without a doubt the best beer I've ever had. I have encountered better beers (and better IPAs) since then but this beer will always remain legendary to me. Unfortunately, I've noticed a bit of variation in Pliny over the last 6 months or so but this particular 11 day old bottle was phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer! I would probably keep this in my fridge all the time if it weren't so damn hard to come buy. It's an extremely refined IPA. Would be a great summer IPA because it's not so heavy; it goes down easier than most IPAs. Just the right amount of hopiness covers up all alcohol flavor without being overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o-not impressed, yes I could drink this every day without problem, but nowhere near a top contender among others like Abner, Double Sunshine, Heady, Sculpin, and Nelson. I'm happy to receive it as an extra but wouldn't trade just for it, meh."

"O: what I really enjoy about this beer is pronounced flavor profile and incredible balance. The 8% ABV is well hidden and the brew is quite quaffable. It was worth the wait and very happy to have found it. Lived up to the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think I prefer more fruity, flowery aromatic hops but this is great for what it is. I would buy it again. Hoping to try it on tap next time."
"O: After my first sip, I was saying """I don't know if this lives up to all the hype.""" But after drinking it a little more I think it does. It's extremely easy to drink, especially for an 8% ABV beer. It has an enormous amount of hops, but it also has some malts there to balance them somewhat. I wouldn't say it's a perfect IPA, but it's pretty close. I'll gladly drink one anytime I can get my hands on one."

"(Draft) Finally tried this beer last month at the Russian River Brewing Restaurant and it lived up to all the hype. Just the right amount of hoppiness with a fantastic finish. Right up there with many of my Lagunitas favs. Check out other selections from Russian River Brewing...they do not disappoint. (October 2012)"
"Compared to HT...The main difference is that HT has more of that citrus, mango fruity hop and has a shiste load of floaties. I feel that HT uses a Hop extract while PtE doesn't. I enjoy the HT about .0001% better. Lovely!!"
""
"An on the level, well-rendered DIPA - you get your hop fix, in spades, and yet the inherent balance remains steadfast. I gotta say, it delivers, and though it isn't perfect, what really is? I can see why the hype exists, and will indeed persist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was scared the hype would ruin this for me. How can a beer seriously live up to the ridiculous amount of hype that Pliny regularly gets? Not only did it live up to those expectations, it surpassed them. I promised myself I wouldn't be swayed by the reviews and wouldn't """say I liked it, just to like it""" - but it's impossible. There's a reason this beer is so highly acclaimed. It's ridiculously amazing."
""
"O: Great beer, but competition is tough these days. A few years ago this was my favorite IPA/DIPA, but with the popularity of the style, there are so many other great West Coast IPAs these days that this one, while delicious, doesn't stand out above the rest in any real way."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very drinkable and has no trace of alcohol in the taste. It also has an excellent balance between the malts and the hops."

""
""
""
"O: A good DIPA overall. Not the best out there by any means, but definitely a great example of the style. I wish the aftertaste weren't so bitter and the nose were a bit more pungent, but other than that it's a very enjoyable beer."

"O: it's a very good ipa. the skunk reminded me of the stone's drink-by 12.21.12, but stone is more pronounced skunk than this one. very good ipa"

"Had on recent trip to Stone Brewery in San Diego. Initial appearance is a decadent hazy gold with foamy white head and excellent lacing. Aroma is simple--hop forward with classic grapefruit and piney notes. Exactly what I was anticipating. Taste is the same. Wonderful balance of hops, citrus, and malt. Great finish transitioning from the sweetness of the malt to the hop bite at the end. Medium body with good level of carbonation. Unbelievably easy to drink for the style (had 4 that day) and well balanced. A fantastic offering from Russian River."

"Pliny the Elder is good. But it’s not great. The beer is VERY hard to find, and while not very expensive when you do, not that impressive. There are some unique characteristics here, but nothing to write home about. I wanted to like this more than I do, and while it is still a good IPA… it’s just that. An IPA. I wasn’t impressed with Dark Lord, either. There is too much hype over beers like that. Maybe that is what spoils it for me. Not sure. But Pliny the Elder is just that… a hyped beer that doesn’t live up to the hype. BeerAdvocate rates this 100. So do the bros. Would love to discuss this beer with them further. I can’t give it more than a 3. Bottoms up, but only because this beer is rare!"

"O: The perfect IIPA? Pretty much."
"Overall...I like this beer."

"Beer snob is what this beer usually is what we are called when you talk so highly of this beer. Well, I am a beer snob and this beer helped create the title. Full flavor, very clean finish. It bites but than smooths like butter. It is actually a little strange. The fruit makes it sweet but hops make it bite. This beer stands out from your centennial, cascade blast of most. It is full of love! I never give a five! Hint of fresh juice and maybe a sweet flower. Simcoe maybe but just enough. The malt could be thinner for color but I love the power so I am just fine with it. Fresh beer! To say the least."
""
"After fearing that I'd never have this, my brother-in-law scored a bottle and split it with me. It was poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint. With a beautiful crystal clear rich golden appearance, there was a frothy one finger head, a little bit of lacing, and a constant stream of bubbles rising to the top. The nose was fruit, grass, resin, bread, malt, and hops. Taste was awesome. It had a wonderful sweet malt profile which seamlessly gave way to a massive hop bomb on the finish. The mouthfeel was very full and satisfying, with just the right amount of carbonation. I have never gave all fives to a beer before, but this one earned it."
"O- Every drink leaves you wanting more. Crisp clean profiles and great drink ability. The worst part of the beer is when it's gone."

"Despire the insane hops and relatively high alcohol, this one is so drinkable. This review doesn't really do the beer justice and I can see why it is held in high regard. Drink it fresh!"
"O: An amazing beer with a great reputation that is hard to understand unless you have a bottle or two in front starring you down. This is a good day."
""
"I don't give 5s willy nilly, in fact this is my first. This stuff is sublime. Its 100% worthy of the hype. Pure hop wizardry. Perfect in every way in my estimation. I like that its very light colored, that's appealing to me for IPAs. If you like hops you have to sample this. This might well be the best beer I have ever tried."
""
"Overall: This is a refreshing and crisp enjoyable beer. The sweet grapefruit notes pair well with the hoppy punch and the mouthfeel is a great pair with the flavors. Makes you want to take big gulps, which is a great sign. There is no booziness for an 8.0% and it tastes great. I’d go back to this one again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is damn near perfection. The hype is real."
""
"Overall: Overall, this beer seems pretty close to flawless to me. I love the style and this beer and I would love to get my hands on a case of it fresh down the road! Cheers!"
""

"O - It's not bad by any stretch but I didn't feel it as special as many other reviewers do."
""
""
""
""

"Truly a well brewed, Master beer. Thank-you, Russian River. Highly recommend the trip..."

"Obviously this is a top shelf beer and worth getting your hands on anytime...it's (usually) cheap too...only $6 for a 510ml. Russian River does a really good job with supply in that the manage to keep the demand heavy, maybe unnecessarily so but I don't work RR QC. That said, I've had better/comparable DIPAs that didn't evade me for years. If they made just a bit more of this and retained the quality, it just might be the best beer around for the money. As it stands, it compares well with DFH90, Firestone Walker Double Jack, and ODells Myrcenary."
""

""

"Drove two hours to get this and it was worth it. Im writing this the day after so details escape me, hower pliny the elder is a wonderful perfectly constructed IPA. What I will say is that it isnt overly distinctive, rather I found its real appeal in how well it was put together. Unlike Heady Topper or Double Citra which are wonderfully artful and unique beers, Pliny the Elder seems less creative yet amazingly thought out and well planned, like amish furniture. A perfect balance and of malt and hops, both playing off each other. Sort of a fusion east coast/west coast IPA. Good body, if maybe a little thin, and lively but not intrusive carbonation. Really just perfect. This beer doesnt stike me as being a centerpiece and while Heady Topper seems somehow more interesting, I dont think you could really do too much better than Pliny the Elder."
""

"Overall: I'm very lucky to have been able to get this beer as fresh as I have. If I had anything to compare this to, it would be Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, only this is better. For what this beer is, it delivers in spades. Hops, hops, hops!!! I expected a beer that kills 90 Minute IPA, and although it is easier to drink than 90, I don't know if I'd say it's better. This is more about hops and less of the maltiness that some of the DFH IPAs are known for, and that's not a bad thing. It's different, and amazing in its own right. Only you can decide if this beer lives up to the hype, but it is great."

"A heady brew, with a lot of hop character. Consumed fresh, it is inspiring, and probably the best Double IPA for its balance and complexity. It is very hard to point to where this could improve, it all works so well together. Excellent from start to finish, all put together wonderfully. If the other reviews and hype haven't driven home the point that this is one of the best beers out there, don't know what will."
""
"Does it live up to the hype?No. I guess I'm the odd man out. The Emperor is wearing no clothes. Aroma is good, sweet and astringent, apricot/orange and orange peel.The appearance is fine. The taste is unbalanced. The bitterness bubbles too strong to the back of the mouth leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. The palate is fine. Overall for my taste, sweetness and bitterness should have been blended better. Being a new beergeek, I'm not that sophisticated yet, so I'll take a Dogfish Head 90 Minute over """The Elder""" any day."

"I had heard so many great things about this beer, that I was possibly over hyping it to myself. All said and done it was a great tasting beer, but really wasn't what I had expected. The body was very thin in contrast to what I had expected. Great aroma and flavor, just very little malty backbone to support the aroma. Happy, but surprised"
""
"O- This is definitely one of, if not the best """hoppy""" beers I have tasted. I do not think it is over-hyped at all. In fact, I can imagine that this would be my 6-pack per week beer if it were available in VA. Instead, I will order a bottle from CA whenever I have the chance. Spectacular Double IPA from Russian River! I can tell that other breweries have tried to do something similar, but I have yet to find one that is so perfectly balanced. Going down in the books as my favorite!"

"D - An overall great beer. Very drinkable. For a 2xIPA it hides the higher alcohol content well with a great balance with just enough sweetness to balance the hops bitterness. Excellent (or should I say the perfect) example of a West Coast 2xIPA."

"Top tier IPA or imperial IPA (depending on who you ask) - tastes better and much easier drinking than most """DIPA's/Imperial IPA's""". Definitely one of my favorite IPA's from this fine state!"
""
""

"Great beer, just enough hoppyness to get a great after taste. I would recomend this beer to anyone who is into IPA's or even just starting to venture into IPA beers. This beer is on this strong side of ABV so beware , it might go down smooth but will creep up on you."
""

"I get this one whenever I can, and thankfully, it is plentiful where I live. I've yet to find one better than this, and I've had quite a few great ones in the last year (some of my favorites being from homebrewers). True perfection, and worth all the hype, in my opinion. Perfect example of West Coast hoppy IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fresh pears, pine, citrus...I had super high expectations and it delivered big time. Toronado (SF), poured a pint that I wanted to roll around in. A truly special beer. I've had some of the best IPA's out west having worked at a brewery in Portland, lived there, and traveled up and down the coast searching for that quintessential west coast IPA. This is in the top five without a doubt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So is it worth all the hype? It'd depend on the style you frequent most, with this being the godfather of the double ipas. Though I find my nine hour pilgrimage every couple months to be worth it, friends and family who aren't too into beer say it's simply """alright," which honestly is probably the best you can hear from someone who hasn't developed a palate for dipas or craft beer in general. All in all there's a reason it's the #5 top all time beer, if you drink a lot of ipas this is probably the biggest 'must try' on your bucket list."

"Pliny poured a beautiful golden hue with about a 1/2 finger head. Classic west coast hop bomb smell. Juicy citrus smell that makes your mouth water. The taste and mouthfeel are awesome. The balance between the malt and hops is spot on. Overall Pliny is an amazing beer, and it's easy to see why it's in the top 5."
"Great job RR"

"O- One of my favorite beers. I had many different ones on this evening. Including vintage. But this was one of two that stood out. Perplexing and satisfying all in one. The mouthfeel and balance is what stood out. While the aroma and taste were definitely strong, I expected that."
"O: My burps taste better than your favorite food. This one's worthy of the hype."

"Pliny is by far one of my top favorite Beers! The color is perfect, pours excellent with a beautiful white creamy head! The nose is just amazing with it's citrusy, piney, earthy amormas with hints of herbs. The taste is nothing short of a hop party in your mouth! Starting of with sweet honey mixed with citrusy hoppy undertones moving into a multitude of barley and malts mixing with the taste buds in my mouth bringing me to the pinnacle of Imperial IPA ecstasy! 'nuff said! It's a real Hop Heads dream! Kudos Russian River! Cheers!"

"Taste was too bitter for my palate, I did not enjoy the hoppiness. This also was reflected in the mouthfeel. I had a bitter aftertaste for more than a comfortable amount of time after I swallowed."
""
"bright crisp looking copper colored body with a generous three fingers of thick white suds. loads of lacing and ring after ring around the mug as the beer dwindled. huge tropical fruit in the nose, i could smell this all day! pineapple, mango, lemon, orange, grass, malts and toasted biscuits. taste is very pineapple forward. bright, crisp and juicy all describe what i taste, very fresh tasting nectar of the gods. a little sticky pine oil on the inside of my cheeks helps to keep the sweetness under control. a dry bitter finish is quickly washed away by more juicyness and leaves me wanting more. one bottle of this is not enough and only lasted as long as it did because i was taking notes. i'm a believer!"
""
""
"Second of all, why does everybody think this beer is awesome? It's clearly not. It's a cloudy orange pour. Good smell of floral hops. And a lot of grapefruit hop bitterness which is completely unchecked by the thin, weightless malt. And that's not the end of it. This beer has 8% alcohol, but it does about as good a job hiding it as STEEL RESERVE. It's actually not a bad beer, and I should be happy everyone loves it. I don't have any trouble finding Alesmith's IPA when I'm thirsty."
"Hype? Plenty of it. Be it known that there are many, many delicious IPAs out there, but it's unlikely that you'll find too many better than this one. An OG (Original Gangstah, not Gravity) on the scene - lives up to the hype, and then some. Shipping a couple bombers back to the East Coast with me."

"O- I will be seeking this beer fresher than fresh because this is simply the best IPA I have ever experienced. This is everything I want from an IPA: gushing aroma and flavor, lightish body, dry leave. I expected a bolder IPA from the hype, something you couldn't help but be blown back by. But no, this is perfection in its subtleties, in its sublime BALANCE, that ever-important elusive quality... I am being honest in marking down aroma and taste to 4.5, but this bottle is over a month old and I have this deep-seated feeling that it IS a 5, when just a bit fresher.... indeed the brewer's labeling suggests this. Wow. Santa Rosa, here I come."
"A hop lovers dream, this lived up to the hype for the most part, but I think I need to try it out at the brewery to maximize the experience. I agree this is one of the best beers on the planet, as something so strong and flavorful should not be this easy to drink, yet this beer was so smooth that I had to hold myself back and force myself to sip it at times – it was that damn good. Incredibly easy to drink and extremely tasty, I am very happy that I was able to finally indulge in this world glass beer. A very high recommendation that I will seek out again and even travel to Northern California to have again – it’s that good."
""

"I will say, there are sooo many West Coast IPAs out there that are as good or very similar, that to me, it's not that """special""". It's become one of many... I like it very much; but there are so many similar others that I also like."

""

"Overall – There was no way that this beer was going to live up to the hype of the ratings and the beer snobs. It was a great beer but nothing that I would go to great lengths to search out. Though, if I could find it at my local beer store, it would be on the “To Buy List”."

"This beer is just over a month old, so hopefully it is still fresh ;-) Pours a clear golden orange, with a hint of red highlights if held in the right light. The aroma is primarily lightly caramelized sugar and some grapefruit rind. There is also a hint of mint. The taste begins with a huge candied apricot flavor. Next is a dry table water cracker malt middle. The finale is an herbal, super citrusy toungue wrench... In a good way of course. Every few sips you get a burst of super sweet pineapple in the beginning. Mouthfeel is rich, despite how dry a DIPA this is. Overall an exceptional DIPA. I will say that Pliny the Elder is not my personal favorite DIPA, however, its not surprising to see it ranked so highly. You really can't go wrong here."
""
""
""
""
"O: When talking about West Coast IPAs and DIPAs, this is the standard to which all are measured. Rightfully so. It's pretty much perfect from stem to stern. An extremely well-crafted beer, and one that can scratch that hop itch like no other."
""
"This is my 2nd time tasting Pliny and I come away simply thinking that sure, its very very good, but if I was given it in a blind testing without knowing what it was I certainly wouldnt think """this is one of the greatest things ive tasted in my life"""... It seems on par with most really good IIPAs.. Making me thinking its high rating comes largely from fame rather than innate worth.."
""
""
"O- Some really great things are happening with this beer and it is one of the top IPAs I have had, but the rumors of the greatness have disappointed. I can't believe that Zombie Dust doesn't have a better score than this, but thats life. I think I will have a zombie dust right now."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's hard to live up to the hype with a beer like this, but the Elder comes pretty darn close. One of the best DIPAs out there."
""
"O - Definitely one of the best tasting DIPA's out there. I really enjoy the drinkability of this beer. A little pricy for the 16 oz bottle, but I guess when you have a beer with a following like this one you can charge a little more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is my favorite beers. It's the epitome of balance. No one characteristic of the beer stands out as being the """most""" of anything. It's not the hoppiest, it's not the booziest, it's not as thick or intense as other DIPAs (such as Hopslam, Double Jack, or Dreadnaught), but it is balanced and it is delicious. It is the DIPA by which all other DIPAs, or even beers for that matter, are measured... and it is well-deserved."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very enjoyable and incredibly easy to drink. If I was in a location where this was a regular offering, I could see it being a regular pick regardless of its hype factor. But back to whether it's the best beer out there - I can't say at this time. Still, it is a beer any craft beer afficianado must try. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Great, great ale. I love it and will definitely be trying it again.(too bad there is a one bottle only limit hehe.) well balanced IPA that has a fantastic citrus fruit smell/taste. I did try this at dinner(salad with steak strips/vinaigrette .) plus i opened a bottle of Stone's Ruination 10th anniversary which overall probably affected the drinking experience because the ruination was soooo strong. But i found this to be a fantastic beer. MUST HAVE"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my one year anniversary review!"
""
""
"O- This was a very good IPA however not as good as I was expecting for an IPA ranked so high. Definitely up there with other world class IPAs, but not as good as some others I've had (Heady Topper, Double Sunshine, HF, Head Hunter). Finishes a little bit too dry for my liking and not enough aroma. Overall I enjoyed this beer and if I was in California I would probably drink it all the time."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellently crafted Double IPA that showcases the floral hops. Superbly--nay, dangerously--drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"It's still phenomenal. Definitely not a bitter hop bomb, but much nuance of papaya, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, passion fruit and all sorts of tropical elements combined with a lightly sweet malt backbone to reign in the hoppy attack. Such a smooth and creamy mouthfeel too. It's certainly right at the top of the heap of excellent tropical citrus tasty type of DIPA, IPA and PAs such as Zombie, Pseudo Sue, Arctic Panzer, Abrasive, etc., etc. No question. I'd stock this twelve x twelve deep if it were available here in MN."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Taste - well, let's skip to overall. The taste of this beer is good. Easily drinkable and not too over the top for a DIPA. I can certainly appreciate the charms of this beer, but I must say I am bamboozled by the 100 point score and massive following this beer has. I am happy to have tried it, and I would never turn another one down, but I don't plan on exerting too much effort to seek it out in the future. Too much hype influencing the anticipation, perhaps?"
""

"Overall a tremendous showcase for hops, with malt secondary but there in sufficient quantities to provide a backbone. The alcohol character is well masked. A surprisingly drinkable 8% ABV DIPA."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely the top IPA in my catalog, but not an overall favorite. Personal choice is exactly that."

"Overall: This is a fantastic beer. I recommend anyone try it if they can get their hands on it. However, it is certainly not the gods gift to men and it doesnt really live up to the massive hype surrounding it (but who cares, its delicious!). It is a solid DIPA, very drinkable, with some great depth and rich complex flavors."

"A rare perfect 5! There's a reason for the hype. If you drink it fresh, there really can't be an IIPA better than this. That orangy color, that big fruty, hoppy smell, that rich flavor and surprising ease of drinking are unreal. Russian River is close enough where I can have one every now and then, but it's not sold in my state so often if I'm in the mood for a IIPA I have to look elsewhere. And as much as I love Hop Stoopid and 90-minute, they can't replace Pliny."

"Hype is legit. Wonderful earthy hop smells, modest white head with excellent lacing. Great spice, low carbonation and perfect creamy mouthfeel contributes to an ideal balance. Dangerously drinkable but not to worry as the taste is long lasting. 8% ABV is lost in the robust and classic biscuit and caramel flavors. Gets smoother and creamier as it warms. Ruins the tastebuds for a lesser IPA. It's 3k mile journey to my table led to lofty expectations. In the end, Pliny delivered."
"OV: Well this set the standard for DIPAs so what can I say? Was I a little underwhelmed? Yes, but there is so much hype behind Pliny. It is a fantastic DIPA that I would always return to but I tend to favor the DIPAs such as Myrcenary or Hopslam."
""
""
""
""
""

"It is what it is. Much hyped, and much anticipated to drink when I received this bottle with care from the northwest coast. After taking the bottle out of my beer refrigerator, I allowed it to get to a bit above 50 degrees (I wasn't going to pair this with anything but tasty cheese, bleu and aged cheddar in this case). My wife happened to have made a nice salad of corn, cilantro, tomato, black and garbanzo beans etc. Anyway, the pour, a beautiful golden haziness. Vivid white fluffy head. The smell, as great as any other regarded IPA I've enjoyed (citrus/piney splendor). Artful lacing in the Chimay chalice used here. When I tasted this I immediately realized this is a benchmark brew. The balance is impeccable for a hoppy ale. Bitter sure. And the malt is there, but everything else is too and it is well, well done. Like I said a benchmark. Drinkability off the charts. If i have to pick one bottled beer that epitomizes quaffability, thus far this is it. I can only hope to vacation in northern CA soon in order to sample the Younger!! The only disappointment I had, and it's nothing that can impact the perfect scoring, is that I only have one of these! But then again that's all I need to realize PTE deserves the cult-like status it possesses. As a double IPA, everything is right-on."

"Overall: Amazing beer overall. This beer is incredibly hyped and deservedly so. The only other DIPA that I would compare to it is Bell's Hopslam from 2011 (2012 was far too boozy for me and not very balanced, in my opinion). If you see it, try it. If you don't see it, trade for it. Whatever you do, try some fresh Pliny the Elder. From what I've seen, beer doesn't get much better than this."

"O - great IPA, DIPA and beer. It's one of the best IPAs around If not the best."
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium orange amber. Light head, but nice lacing. Fresh spicy hop aroma. Hops up front. Sweet malts, citrus and a hint of pineapple. You know there are some nice malts underneath, but they stay below detectable levels supporting the spicy hops flavor. A beautifully balanced IPA. Deserves top ranking."

"Appearance is yellow straw, 2 fingers of head at first, that goes shorter soon. The nose is mango, other fruit, pine and hops. Taste of this well known IPA is grapefruit, more hops, a bit of malts too. Mouthfeel is low-medium, a bitter finish, but a refreshing one. A great beer, not one the level that it seems some make it out to be, but still a damn good beer."

"O: An awesome brew well deserving of the hype. I personally find Hopslam a touch more appealing due to the honey character. wish i could get this at store level in the Midwest...asking price (via trade) is too high for me. 90 minute or Alpha King will be a fine substitute for now."

"O- Lives up to the hype. At first glance it would seem like this is hard to get, but I'm sure at around 5 bucks a bottle at the brewery there are some BA's out there willing to spread the wealth and let others enjoy it. Seek this one out."
""
""
"O- This is my third favorite IPA, behind Citra and of course Heady Topper. I never get tired of this though, it definitely lives up to the hype and worth trading for if you've never had it. I can't wait to try Younger one day."
"Overall: A damn good IPA. Nothing flashy, but very well made and drinkable."

"Being from NY, I consider myself very lucky to have had!!"
""
""
""
""
"Hell yeah."
"O - Blah, I hate myself for not giving all 5s. I guess I'm just not as sophisticated as you guys. This beer delivers everything up front with appearance and smell, then drops off a little with the taste. I wish that smell translated a little better into the taste, but what can you do? Would gladly take all this I could find, but wouldn't give body parts for it."
""
""
"Ok, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. This is a great freaking beer. Honestly, I'm not a hop head and don't rush for the IPAs. But, this is truly one of (if not the) best bottled IPAs you can get your hands on. On the tap, I'm not sure if I would rank this above Blind Pig, but RR obviously has the IPA gig down. Great, golden appearance with just the right carbonation. Wonderful, grapefruit nose with all the things you love about hoppy beers and none of the stuff that scares you away. Wonderful taste and mouthfeel. I could keep going, but what more can you say about perfection. Buy this when you can find it. You won't find a better IPA in a bottle."
""
""
""
"Worth all of the hype and wish I had access to more in South Florida. I don't know how they do it, but everything is in perfect balance from flavor-profile to mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"It's hard not to penalize this one because it didnt quite live up to my unrealistic expectations but I tried to rate it on merit alone. I wont do a full review because i had it yesterday afternoon...It is an awesome beer no question. I was expecting life changing waves of flavor and it was more subtle balance. In the end if someone were to offer me a Pliny or a Dreadnaught I would kick them in the nuts and take both but if they were bigger than me and I had to pick one I would take Dreadnaught without a second thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious IPA, no doubt. Everyone should agree on that. However, I am going to say that it is not anything life changing, as some of the reviews might make you think. Slightly over-hyped, but still worth picking up."
""
""
""
""
"+ Just to make it Clear. I am giving this Beer very good scores, which is unusual for me. This is not a """ hop on the bandwagon """ act. This beer is truely great. If you have never tried it. FIND IT!"
"There is quite a bit of hype surrounding this beer and it is nearly impossible to get on the East Coast. My tasting notes: Rich amber, slightly cloudy with medium carbonation. Strong piney hops on the nose. Tastes crisp and pleasantly bitter, very refreshing; not overpowering like many other American double IPAs. 8% alcohol, but very smooth, no strong fusel notes. Extremely well balanced with pine and citrus notes dominant. One if the best beers I've had in a long time. If we lived where this is distributed, Pliny would enjoy an honored place in the beer fridge. Salud!!"

"O - The hype is pretty damn high on PtE, thats for sure. But damned if it does not meet or exceed all my expectations. There are alot of great IPA/IIPA out there, but Pliny is the leader. There were repeated, """Wow", """Damn""" and """Sh!t that's good""" exclamations through the whole bottle. This stuff should come with a warning label: Caution - Highly addictive. You will be pissed that you dont have another bottle when you finish, trust me. Well done."

"I think the hype of Pliney may have affected my first impression. I excepted fireworks works would go off and Bob Barker would scream out telling my i won a brand new car. At first i felt Pliney seemed like an average beer, but after a few sips i realized how balanced and perfect this beer is."

"O: BEST DIPA/IIPA I've ever had. Clearly speaks for its own when it's ranked as a world class beer. I just wish it was more easily accessible! I drank mine out of a 6oz chalice and sipped it over the course of an hour, great experience."

Actually, compared to some of the other DIPAs/IIPAs I've had, there are some I perfer over PtE. That said, again, this beer was fantastic. Great hoppiness and I loved the resinous quality to this beer. I would never turn this beer down and will seek it out again."

"Poured into a Squatters real pint glass a very nice slightly hazy golden orange/yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a one-finger plus thick creamy head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is very nice, lots of hops, grapefruit, pines, with a nice touch of malts. The taste is AWESOME!, hoppy, sweet, tons of grapefruit, piney, and slightly malty. Medium body, with a nice chewy feel, slightly bitter/dry. Overall this is one fine brew, I do believe after reading my other review, this one does kick it's ass, this is what I was expecting after all the hype back then and now. This one is going down pretty fast. Thanks David!"

"Well done, Russian River. You almost make me want to move to CA (not really... folks out there are a bit odd)."

"Strong, hoppy aroma has a strong overtone of grapefruit. Very grapefruit-y. It pours a clear amber with a respectable white head that leaves some good lacing. Flavor is - WOW! Very hoppy, mainly of grapefruit, hardly bitter with a hint of honey sweetness. Firm body is smooth and has plenty of fizz. No wonder this is so recherche."
"Pours a bright golden with a creamy white head and continual bubbles rising to the surface. A sweet, fruity aroma of some grapefruit and its sugars, its rinds, and a nice malt underbelly that gains in influence as the beer warms. Taste follows suit; grapefruit and its sugars, some rind, and a gentle malt underbelly in addition to some floral qualities that show itself throughout. A creamy, silky mouthfeel with some nice activity. Overall, a very nice beer. Perhaps it was simply a case of the tap being fresher but I do think the tap experience was noticeably more enjoyable. No knock on this bottle though which is still really good, and probably would have been better if I didn't have that initial experience to compare it to."

"As a person who lives in Minnesota Pliny the Elder is not available as easy and as often as I wish it could be. I was lucky enough to have some fresh bottles sent to me (as fresh as they can be) however I was even more lucky in early January to get a growler set to me the same day it was picked up from the brewery and delivered to me super quickly!!! I can still remember the huge pop of the 2L swing top growler. So from the grower into a tall pilsner glass the color was light orangy brown in color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. The smell is very big and hoppy and sweet. The taste is super balanced with the amount of hop and sweet. All this high ranked IPA are all so hard to rate because they all are so amazing, it's hard to decide which one is better."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a hop person, but Pliney is a convincing brew, ultra smooth and highly drinkable. It really doesn't get better than this. Glad I got to try some."
"O - A very good DIPA. A lot of competition in this style nowadays. Alpine and Kern River are worth competitors that are sort of local to SoCal but are arguably harder to find. Still one of the paragons that most DIPAs will aspire to be."
"O - Absolutely delicious, the best IPA I've had! Great drinkability, goes down easy and tastes absolutely wonderful. The hop flavors work very well together making it quite refreshing."
""
""
"Overall, I'd have to say that this is indeed a damn fine beer. It didn't live up to the legend it's been made out to be, but I figured that people would exaggerate a bit, and plus because I live near the brewery, it has the whole """local following""" aspect as well. I should note however that it is better than similar DIPAs of higher costs (cough cough Double Jack...), at $4.39/ea at my work (when you can find it...). Certainly a good buy if you're in the mood for an IPA. I would even recommend picking this up over most """normal""" IPAs because it's drinkable enough that spending the extra dollar or two on the bottle will earn you something that's that much better. If you're considering buying it though, or are ever in the area by the brewery, I would say don't hesitate and just do it. You'll be glad you did."
""
""

"Altogether an awesome beer that could be better. Whatever the case, I'm going to finish this one bottle off and look forward to another chance to get one. Na zdrowie!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Definitely one of the best IPAs I’ve had. Not overly bitter, and not overpowered by citrus. Well done."
""
"Overall: Damn near perfect. Pliny really is everything it's cracked up to be. There's a ton of flavor and an incredible level of balance for such intense flavor. You could easily drink 6 of these and never feel the tongue fatigue. Truly a prime example of hops and their execution. If only I had this all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pliny The Elder is one top-notch example of what appears to be a growing style. You definitely need to have your heart (and palate) set for some hops if you order a pint of Pliny."
""
""
"Bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a Holden straw color with two fingers of creamy off white head that lingers. Lots of lace as the head slowly dissipates. Smells of pine, grass and citrus fruits. Wonderful aromas, strong example of how a DIPA should smell. Taste is the same as the nose, bitter pony biogas lead the way followed by juicy citrus notes and flight biscuity sweetness. Finishes dry and bitter, perfect amount of carbonation, medium body. Pliny is an amazing beer, totally lives up to its reputation. Well worth grabbing a bottle or two even chance you get."
""
""
""
"Honestly I hate more than anyone to turn beers into a war between west coast vs. everyone else, but I have a hard time swallowing the hype with this beer (pun intended). It's good, don't get me wrong, and for what it is it's done extremely well. However, it doesn't come near dethroning the handful of FFF IPA's that outrun Pliny in this beer arms race."
""
""
""
"o - overall, I thought this was delicious for sure. i could drink a few of these (but we only had one...) without even thinking about the 8% ABV - dangerous. At very first, i was slightly disappointed, since it didn't seem to impress me with any hop flavor. but as i continued to drink i realized how wrong i was, it is quite simply a perfectly balanced IPA/beer. doesn't get too much better than this if what you want is an incredible IPA."

"Great, and I mean great flavor from start to finish."
""
""
"There was one time when I did get a few bottles and it was way below par. It must have been a bad batch. it wasn't old since I bought it the day the truck delivered it."
""
""
""
""
"O- Incredible beer but the taste was a slight letdown after the complex initial aromas. Still one of the best DIPAs I've had. A little too balanced for my personal taste, I prefer an onslaught of hops paired with a minimal amount of defenseless malt in this particular style. Nevertheless, you can bet I savored the last drop."

"original review on: 09-08-2010"
""
"Edit: This was not intentional, but it was my 300th review! A very apropos review, indeed."
""
""
""
"The balance between hops & malts is really key with this beer, then coupled with the incredible aroma, this beer really stands out as one of the best."
""
"Body is light-medium with moderate carbonation and finishes dry on the palate. Overall this isn't greater or worse than what I expected, it is exactly what I expiated in different ways. It's a solid, extremely well balanced IPA that justly deserves it's place in the beer community."
"Did it live up to the hype for me? Yes and no. I'm looking for flaws and they're just not coming up. This beer is really perfectly executed, and for what it is it's hard to beat. That said, it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would, and I think it could definitely be improved on. I wouldn't lose sleep if I could never have this beer again, and I don't think it's worth trading your firstborn child, but I will gladly have more whenever I get the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with medium-level carbonation. This causes the beer to foam up a bit on the palate, leading to a slightly smooth, but still crisp mouthfeel. Finish is dry, from the hops. No ethanol burn felt. Very impressive for a DIPA in all aspects of this."
""
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers, but hard to come by in my home state of Florida. It is not the best IPA I have ever had, but it is one of the top five."
""
"O: Probably the best beer that have I ever had. I was caught by surprise. I only ordered it, because it was the only IPA at the butcher shop that I hadn't drank before. I was just blown away by how complete and balanced this was."
""
""
""
"Had this at the brewpub. Tastes very hoppy with a bitter finish that attacks your tongue nicely. Lots of citrus and grapefruit notes. I love how these California beers give me hop burps. the alcohol is well hidden in this one too. This is a top quality iipa."

"This is probably on the same level as Sucks and Sculpin. I just went through a case of Sucks and this actually tastes almost the same ha."
"O: Underwhelming. It's pretty tasty, but doesn't nearly deserve the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Dangerously drinkable. The 8% is hidden very well. I could drink this all day, everyday and never get sick of it. Extremely well made, lived up to the hype."
""
""
"O - Again, a great beer. Probably a solid A (A+ for style) but it doesn't belong as #1 on the top 100."
""
"I've had Pliny on tap, from a bottle and a growler which is the same as tap I guess. Anyhow, on tap is the perfect blend of freshness, coolness and taste. It encompassed everything you want in a beer; taste, high ABV and did I mention taste? Perfection in a glass. The color is a beautiful orange with a bouquet of hops. The taste is a perfect balance of well, just about everything. """Just get it"""."
"Thank Pete!"
""
"Definitely worth a try and highly, highly recommended."

"O: This definitely lives up to its reputation, and being from Ohio where it's unfortunately not distributed, I picked up a couple bottles to fly back with me. Truly an epic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A shining example of an imperial IPA. It is well balanced yet hoppy. Earthy yet heavenly. Truely a tale that deserves a spot in history!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Not much I can add other than to say it's definitely one of the best beers i've tasted. I knocked off a tiny .5 from appearance because i've seen beers with a little better head retention and lacing, and I took off a tiny .5 from taste because I like a little more piney hop character like Lagunitas frequently includes; but this is a top notch beer that all hop heads should enjoy one time or another."
""
""
""
""
""
"edit: even more perfect on tap, at the brewery. if you like hoppy beers, this is a sojourn worth taking. just sensational!"
"O: I've had PtE a few times on tap, but this is my first bottle experience.  It's good, very good, but to me it doesn't live up to the hype.  The aroma is great, but the taste just doesn't quite do it for me.  I wish the citrus explosion from the nose was more prevalent on the tounge.  Now don't get me wrong, this is a really really good brew, that I will drink any chance I get.  However,  when it comes to the big DIPA's, my order is Hopslam-->Heady Topper--> PtE, and I can even say I've had a couple non 'big name'  DIPAs that I think are better offerings.  It's a must try for any craft beer fan, but not on the level of Hopslam or HT.  "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic brew, had some high hopes before I opened it and was not let down at all. Glad my buddy got me a bottle of this now hopefully I can try the Younger. This is a great brew, well balanced and great tasting, perfect!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The quintessential double IPA, created by the brewer of the first Double IPA, Vinnie Cilurzo. I've had this beer hundreds of times and every time I drink one, I am continuously taken aback by the balance, drinkability and sheer quality of the hops in this beer. There has been many imitations attempted by many craft brewers, but I have yet to taste a single Imperial/Double IPA that toes the delicate line of balancing in your face hops and bready maltiness. Do plenty of other craft brewers make bigger and hoppier beers? Sure, but none can make me appreciate the finer things in life as much as Pliny does. Every craft beer enthusiast needs try a FRESH batch of Pliny straight from the tap."

"Pours a light copper color with a small white head and good lacing. Aroma is all about citrus and pine hops and a bit of caramel in the back. Taste is caramel malts with loads of hop flavors mostly citrus, grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation."

"O: This is one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever had, I tried these when I was out in CA before I starting writing up reviews and had been waiting to get my hands on one now that I started writing reviews.

"Pours a copper golden color with a huge, fluffy, white head. The head seems to have a life of it's own and taunts the would be consumer with contempt. It's like a watched pot that never boils. I've never seen a head retain so well. You think you're taunting me beer? Well, guess what, I'm reviewing you on BA, so I've got time. In keeping with the theme of this weekend past, the bouquet is as if a golfer at Augusta National had missed the fairway and ended up in the pine straw. While he waited for his partner to hit his ball, he dropped the big, juicy grapefruit he was eating into the pine straw. Hints of biscut malt come through as well. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect for this style. The oilyness is very pleasing and complimentary to the flavor/aroma. This is a masterfully balanced IPA. Everything works together to deliver a whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experience. It not only involves, it demands the attention of your sight, olfactory, taste, and tactile senses. Pine up front, then some orange citrus, and finishes with some grapefruit. Just a wonderful beer."

This is one beer that lived up to the hype of a top billing while I have been disappointed with others. This is my 2nd favorite DIPA behind Kern Citra, but ahead of Heady Topper. Top Notch beer."

"Overall: One of my favorites and I am very happy that they distribute to my area quite frequently. I have had many double IPAs and this one is still the king to me (although I am DYING to try Citra IPA because it sounds like Pliny 2.0). Fresh, citrusy, liquid gold. And for 8%, this is a VERY drinkable beer. I will buy a bottle of this every time I see it."
""
""
""
"O - I obviously opened this beer with very high expectations. I was impressed by how much citrus was in this beer. Reminds me of an """Imperial Zombie Dust.""" Incredibly balanced and overall, very impressive. Every once in a while I have a beer that has the flavor to sets it apart from the rest, and this is one of those cases. I drink alot of DIPAs, but this was a little bit different, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
""
"O: Ok, so maybe this is the prefect exercise in balance. That sour taste with the balanced hops and bitter, the sweet, syrupy malt, the, well, the everything. Its all just right. I don't know if this is the best beer ever, it's a damn good beer. Is it worth the hype? Probably. But, really, versus something like Firestone Walker's Union Jack, Stone's Double Bastard, or Great Divide's Hercules DIPA, I'd be hard pressed to choose a favourite. It would depend on where I was, what I was doing there, and how much the bar was charging for each."

"Not waaay too bitter, but it gets it's point across, well balanced if you you step back and look at it. It's the other spectrum, imo from the more citrus heavy IPA's. A very good beer anyone should try at LEAST once."
""
"O: The gold standard in aggressive hop-forward beers. The thing that sets this apart from many others is that it pushes the limits without going over and has such a nice smooth finish for such a massive hop profile. I wish more """hop bombs""" were like this. Just be sure to get it fresh!"
"O: One of my new favorite IIPAs. I wish I had better access to this. Hard to see where this beer could be improved."
""
""
""
"I can quickly name several IPA's which I prefer to this one. So, I gotta add that the hype is overrated. But props to Vinny for making awesome beers (he created the XL IPA) and being an awesome crusader for craft beer. And thanks the the Hulmeville Inn for doing a Russian River tap-takover!"
"O-This beer is one of my staples because of how balanced it is. The aroma of this beer is the standard I use to compare all other beers. I always stock up when I see it on the shelf because it is gone before you know it."
""
"Notes: Either I am crazy or my palate is not refined enough. This did nothing for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is a reason this beer is rated so high."
""
""
""
"Conclusion: Today there are hundreds of IPAs and DIPAs that all taste basically the same. My biggest fear with Pliny was that it would turn out to be just another like so many of the rest, and that outside of a slightly fresher taste it wouldn't stand out. I am glad however to find that it actually is unique, with a flavor that isn't quite like anything else I have tasted. It is an amazingly unadulterated liquid form of fresh hop cones, which is pretty awesome. I can now cease scoffing at the masses for hyping this beer up beyond reach, as it truly is a magnificent DIPA. The best? Nearly, but it doesn't quite take gold in my book. I remember a time when this beer could be seen sitting in the cooler at a local store! I never paid any attention to it and by the time I realized what it was, so had the rest of my town, and now it never even makes it onto the floor, and only lasts a day or two when kept out of sight."

"Flawless, golden color that is as deep as it can be before it starts to move towards bronze. Could retain its head just a bit more. Smell is great, nothing but a one-stop education in American hops with their citrus, pine, and resin, but its strength is also its weakness; I feel like there could be more depth to the hop bouquet. I don't believe DIPAs need to be one dimensional on the nose, since in my opinion the best ones certainly aren't when it comes to flavor. Taste is a perfect balance of towering hop bitterness on a firm malt foundation, not too sweet, not too dry; while this is obviously a thoroughly bitter beer, the rest of the elements keep it in check and prevent it from overwhelming the palate. Goes down nice and smooth, just a little overcarbonated, but that isn't an entirely a bad thing as it kept my pace more toward where it should be. Overall, an absolutely stunning beer, a must-have, not the undisputed greatest double IPA I've ever had, but it is certainly fairly high up on the list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However, I can see why this beer is worth the effort."
""
"O: Still not fantastic, but recommendable, if a blunt and rather boring West Coast DIPA. I think I'm done with Pliny."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This really lives up to its hype. This is my second time having it, and it remains the finest crafted DIPA I've had to date. This is one of the only beers that is extremely bitter, but not in a cloying way, which is usually a turn off for me."
""
"O - One of the finest bottled IPAs ever and among my favorite brews. Put this one on my death-row last meal if we can't get the Younger."
""
"Living in Texas we have no chance of getting PLINY (Elder). So, I have waited for months to get my hands on one and after a trade with a friend in Colorado I finally got one. The anticipation from all the hype made it feel like a present and me a little kid on Christmas day. I just wanted to stare at the mythical green and red label. Finally I opened it, poured it and took my first smell and drink. WTF? Who thinks this is the best """bottled""" IPA there is? I was severely underwhlemed. Instead of fireworks and heavenly harps playing in my head I rattled off 5 local IPA's that blow this one out of the water. BUMMER MAN!"
"overall - I thought I was dreaming when I saw this on tap, I knew immediately I must try it or the chance may not come again for a very long time. It was everything I expected it to be, amazing. I had one, and savored a second for as long as I could hold back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure the hype of this beer. Seems most people are willing to kill to get their hands on such a mediocre beer. It's supposedly a double IPA, but in my opinion lacks the hoppiness to be even called a West Coast Style IPA, less that of a DIPA. The smell is reasonable, the taste is just ok. For the money and availability of this beer, the number of other beers outweigh any reason for me to enjoy this product. The color is nice, but that's hardly an achievement. If I could get this everyday, I could rate it higher."

""
""

"Overall - Pliny gets rave reviews, and for good reason. The hops don't overwhelm, a trap too many IPA's and 2IPA's fall into, but rather serve as evidence that when done right, IPA's can be just as drinkable as any other style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - This is about as perfectly balanced a DIPA as I've ever tasted. I was expecting over the top everything, and what I taste is extreme balance and consideration to blending of flavors. I'd drink this any time I could get my hands on it. I definitely rivals Hopslam for drinkability."
"Overall I think Old Pliney senior lives up to the hype."
""
"O: Overall I'm very pleased with this beer. Again, I wish it had a drier mouthfeel, but that is a more personal preference. I would buy it again, I would drink it again."

"O: Great balance. I had it side by side with a Younger and didn't get much difference. A must buy when it pops up on my local shelves."
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure what it is, but Pliny has been seeming off to me lately. Maybe it's just a shift in my tastes, but both bottles and drafts haven't been as good as I recall from a year or two ago. It's still good, but not something I'll go out of my way for."

"O: I never thought I would get to try this, but as luck would have it, I scored one. Definitely lives up to the hype. Absolutely fantastic beer."
"Overall this beer is world-class. It isn't ranked so highliy for no reason! Well balanced, delicious taste, one of those beers that you just want to keep drinking forever. Having a limited supply of Pliny is probably a good thing, because I would likely drink this daily if possible. Easily in my top 3 DIPAs, falling just slightly short of Heady Topper."
""
"O - Definitely a beer that should be sought after by IPA lovers, Elder is very drinkable and highly hopped. 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Long live the king! That said, Pliny's dominance isn't nearly as clear to me as it was the first time I drank it. I've had many amazing beers, many of which are DIPAs, since I first drank this beer. I'll probably rank this highest, because it is in perfect balance and tastes incredible without overwhelming with hops (definitely still a hop monster, though!). This is a beer that I'd die to have easy, regular access to. It has a drinkability that these other world class IPAs (other than Double Sunshine) don't quite have. I could drink this like water and be on cloud nine. Drinking pints and pints of Heady Topper could be a bit taxing, as that's one aggressive beer."
""
""
"M - Perfect carbonation gives this a very refreshing feel. Its not to carbonated to the point where its overwhelming, but it does leave a nice crisp finish. Very drinkable for 8% with no alcohol feel at all. Very thin beer, with a light viscosity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"O - There are VERY few beers, let alone DIPAs, this well rounded. An awesome brew, I may prefer The Elder to The Younger... A good value at $6/500ml, but be warned, it sure does go down fast. Recommended, if you can find it ;) Brilliant work Vinnie."
""
""
""
"Overall: Truly the greatest double IPA I've had the pleasure to enjoy. With all the ranting and raving, I went into this worried I might have too much expectation - don't worry, has as much expectation as you wish, it'll still surprise you in the most decadent of ways!"
""
""
"I could basically drink this day in and day out when I'm in the mood for hops."
"Overall: It was definitely worth getting my hands on and trying. I’ll be honest though, this is a very good IPA, but I don’t think it’s mind-blowing. It does everything right and I don’t think it has any flaws, which makes it a fantastic beer, but the hype surrounding it almost leads you to expect a life changing experience. I recommend everyone try it if they can get a hold of some. It is very good. Just take the hype with a grain of salt."
"Bottle, RR pint glass"
"It's a shame that this thing b hard to get. But I know where to get it 2 week from tha source - fresh. Cuz yeah, it dat good."
"Definitely one of the top DIPA's out there. Displays a very well balanced array of hops, with just a touch of malt finish to keep it balanced."

"O – I was really amped up to try and this beer and am super grateful I got a chance. I was really impressed at how smooth the beer was for the over the top IBU’s. Wish I lived out west so I could drink this guy all the time but unfortunately it will just have to be one of those surprises every now and then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A pretty good beer. Sweet with some nice flavors, a bigger feeling IPA. I think this is much over hyped. Just not the mind blowing beer all the ratings pitch it to be. A great beer for the $6 you pay for it on the West coast, but not worth trading a fortune for. Glad I tried it, but I won't likely search it out in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I can see how this beer generates so much hype and has such a cult-like following. Its hopped to insanity, aromatic, delicious, and with an amazing feel. It even looks appetizing. This beer is simply an all-out sensory assault. It also is incredibly balanced and offers high drinkability. Basically, its what every west coast IPA should aspire to be. I can nitpick at times, but this beer is perfect. Hopslam was my favorite IPA, but Pliny wins in a landslide and if I could give it a 6 I would. A thanks goes out to my brother's girlfriend for bringing me back a bottle from vacation in San Diego. I hope I am lucky enough to revisit this one sooner than later."
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is fantastically drinkable for an 8%. The body is smooth and easily drinkable. The carbonation is slightly fizzy when the beer is held in the mouth but does not detract from either the impact of the flavors nor the drinking experience."
"World-class smoothness and complexity. Totally worth dealing for."
""
""
"Overall: I am happy to have had this. It can easily define the DIPA style for me , as well as many others. That being said, there are many DIPAs that are equally as good, but maybe without the pedigree. I will have a hard time obtaining this in Utah, until I travel some more. I will not seek this out until I travel because we have a few in Utah that are only right behind Pliny, IMHO."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pliny the Elder is an excellent hoppy drinking experience. Overall this is by far the best IPA I've ever had. But, oh wait, they call it a double. At 8%, it's less than 1/2-1% more booze than most IPAs and it's just too thin without a big malty backbone to take solidly into double territory. It IS really good but like most hyped beer it just can't live up to the """best beer ever""" that we all read about. I'll never turn it down but I certainly won't go out of my way to trade for it again."
""
""
"O- this beer is in no way, shape or form over-hyped. It is one of the best brews I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. The dry pine is balanced so well with citrus. I don't think I could ever get enough of this! Thanks, Chris!"
"My wife doesn't care for it. I love it. Well worth the effort to seek out. Hell, I drove over five hours to find it. And I'm glad I did."
""
""
"Excellent - really balances between sweet/dry hop aroma/bitter."
""
""
"O - I could drink this all night, wow. The ABV is totally hidden. It is so smooth and well balanced. As good as it gets. Very surprising that it is a DIPA, it is that smooth and well balanced and hidden alcohol..."
""
""
""
"Overall; this is a world class beer, need I expand on that? I think the hundreds of reviews and lasting overall score can summarize the experience better than I can.."
""
"O - Truly the DIPA for all others to be judged against. Another fantastic beer from Russian River. This bottle is just over a month old but still gives you plenty of hop sting that you crave. Very drinkable for 8% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have had PtE many times in the bottle, on tap, and at the brewery. It never dissapoints and is really the touchstone that I compare all DIPAs to. My favorite beer for a reason."
""
"Find it, get it, drink it"
""
""
"O-This is a must for hop heads-definitely leans heavy on the pine tree type hop flavor. I prefer more of a tropical hop bite versus this resiny pine tree style. If you like your bitter receptors pounded into oblivion this is a great beer for you. I'd rather have a Bell's Hophead that balances the hops with a little more malt backbone. A fun beer to try-but I dig others much better than this one."
""
"Legend....if a layer cake was an IPA, this would be it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: WOW! Strong, complexed, tons of hop, but then goes down smooth and refreshing to drink. It's quite exceptional, malty sweet flavors and hops are released even more strongly throughout. Don't ever pass by a chance to drink this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great DIPA. Definitely a classic, but not the best anymore. Search this out, get it if you can. It's something you want to try if you love DIPAs or even if you don't. That said, I'm glad I live on the east coast so Heady Topper is easier to access, along with Hill Farmstead, which IMO are both better. I think other Cali competitors like Alpine have caught up, also."
"O- An amazing value and a great example of a DIPA that isn't over powering or cloying."
""
""
"Poured a nice orange color as I like my IPAs and DIPAs. Smell was staight up out of a grapefruit or orange orchard. Reminded me of walking around my brother in laws neighborhood in June. Mouthfeel is always lacking on this for me. I feel like the malts should linger more, but I know that big CA IPAs are more hop forward. I don't mind this, would just like a little more malt. Overall, I will never turn this down as part of a trade or as an extra. Thanks!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very intense DIPA, the most intense I've had after Greenflash DIPA (mostly due to its earthy cannabis notes). One of the best DIPAs I've had but not the best, that may fall to Burton Baton. For someone not on the west coast this is the holy grail of beer, partially due to the fact it is nearly impossible to get. Maybe at one point this was -the- DIPA but now there are others that are better, cheaper, and easier to find. Still a great beer, just not the best. Something I would like to try on tap."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is coating but not cloyingly sweet, just a little burn at the back of the tongue, and enough to let you know you're having more than a simple ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely in my top two DIPA's. It's an unbelievable brew that I would go to great lengths to get. If it was available, I could drink this everyday. Pliny in my right hand, Heady Topper in my left."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Perfectly balanced, a beautiful brew. I love American IPAs, this is an epitome of the style."
"O - Pliny the Elder is simply the greatest DIPA I've ever had. This is my fourth time and it gets better every time. When will Russian River come to the DC area!?"
"O-in.a world where breweries are striving to the unique """lightning in a bottle""" one off, this beer truly lays down the gauntlet and challenges any other beer to do it better. Still curious to see how Abrasive and Heady Topper stand up to this bad boy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is truely my favorite DIPA and probably the freshest beer that I get. It is truely one of the best and I highly recommend to anyone."
""
"Overall: Deserving of its status as the paragon of the style. So fresh and hoppy, so easy to put away. I prefer this beer on draft by a small margin but it’s certainly exceptional in the bottle as well. Doesn’t necessarily stand head and shoulders above a handful of other DIPAs but gets all the attention nonetheless. Hard to say anything is better at this level of brewing achievement, just slightly different. The best of Kern, Alpine, the Alchemist, etc. are on par but if you like IPAs and DIPAs this is not one to be missed."

"Overall/drinkability- okay well this is probably one of the beers I looked forward to enjoying trying more then anything else really or at least way at top of the list, i always wonder if i would find it lived up to all the hype, and it did, this beer is stellar, the flavor is just so spectacular and the balance is superb as it is hoppy but never crossing that line of being to much, the body is perfect, in drink ability its just flawless so smooth so slick, and that finish just wont stop, wow just really really good, this beer is all its hyped up to be and more ,far and away my best ipa if not beer, its a beer i only wish i could get all time, props to my guy who got me this thanks for the treat."

"taste was excellent, and the aftertaste did not linger too long like alot of IPA's that I try. I had a small tasting at my house and everybody loved it. not a single vote was negative. i like it because its not too strong, seems almost the perfect range of hops. my mouth was having a party and overall while I cannot rate something as perfect, it is as close to being perfect for my tastes. WELL DONE Russian River, Well done!!!"

"O - this is a really good beer in every single quality, however i think it may just be a tiny bit lacking in the taste aspect. maybe i was just expecting a little too much from such high and mighty reviews. i can't say i don't like it, because i'd be lying, it's a hell of a good beer but i have to say i have had beers (or ipa's) that have been better in the taste department."

"Pours a pale straw gold into my tulip with a frothy white cap of foam. Pine scents immediately waft through the air. Pine and fruit but mostly pine. In the mouth it's pine with a touch of citrus, but mostly pine finishing with a lovely hop bite. Very mellow mouthfeel. I could drink this forever! Amazing beer if you can get it."

"Overall, this is a great double IPA. Given the mouthfeel and the lack of alcohol bite, this beer is very drinkable. If this was available around here, I could easily see consuming several of these in an evening."

"O: It defiantly lived up to the hype for me. Extremely drinkable and very crisp. Overall an awesome DIPA or maybe the most awesome DIPA ( at least that I've had up until this point)."
"Overall: Although the relative inaccessibility of Pliny contributes to its legend, there is no doubt that this beer lived up to much of the hype.

I can’t say this is hands down the best IPA I’ve ever had, but it’s right up there with my favorites in the style. Despite being on the higher end in ABV, this is a brew I could drink all night. 4.75"

"I recently did a tasting and went through at least 5 different IPA's that I had liked in the past. I got to the Pliney at last and it hit the marks on every level. Still one of the greats in my book."

"The color is pretty standard but what stands out is the nice fluffy white head, its about 2 fingers width and lingers for a while then it leaves very nice lacing with each drink. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had absolutely huge piney aroma that smacks you in he face then a hint of some citrus. Taste follows the nose perfectly huge pine flavor right off the bat then some citrus and finally just a touch of sweetness from the malt. I wish there was a touch more sweetness to this but still its pretty outstanding. Mouthful is good for me its thin compared to other DIPA beers that are out there, and the carbonation is on point. This is a great beer I wished we could get some in Indiana at a price point of about $5 for a little over a pint I think this would be a great once a week beer to grab off the shelve if you could."
"Overall - This is an outstanding beer, and I'm glad I was able to find a bottle in CO. I'd love to taste it fresh on tap, but I'm certainly not complaining from the taste I got here."

"With as much of a hop bill as this beer has, my guess is that everything is put in the last 15 minutes of the boil or so. I, disappointedly, did not get any of the enjoyable bruising bitterness indicative of a 250 calculated ibu beer. Great, but not worth the hype, certainly not a top 5 in the world ipa."
"So I'm really missing Michigan brews in California, but goddamn this guy really helps me get through the homestatebeersickness. Definitely gonna make a trip up for the Younger in February, don't really know how to improve on the elder but I guess if anyone can do it it's gotta be RR."

"I just don't get the hype. There are plenty of other IPA's out there that I would rather drink. I wouldn't turn it down but having a choice I'd try something else. At 8% I want a little more body. I love the smell but the taste doesn't really follow through for me."
""
"Overall, this is one of the best beers out there. It's a regular for me when I can get it, and this is an IPA everybody should try. Russian River doesn't disappoint again and I can't wait to try it's big brother, Pliny The Younger"
""
"I would say Pliny lives up to the hype as it is a great beer, but there are definitely comparable IPAs out there. A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well it's not a game changer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's insanely drinkable. The drinkability and the taste reminds me of a tamed Ephraim from Hill Farmstead."

"O: This is a great IPA. I would compare it to Maine Beer Co. Lunch--which has similar taste profile but is unfiltered and I think has a better mouthfeel. These two are the best I've had. It goes without saying that Pliny the Elder is a highly recommended beer. I wish it were available in ME."
""
"O: Deserves the reputation it has. Sets the style for the “classic” west coast DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pliny certainly lives up to its high praise. One of the more balanced and spectacular hop profiles that I've tasted in a beer. Just make sure to drink it as fresh as possible to get the optimal drinking experiences that this beer affords. Well worth trading for if you don't live in Cali."
""
""
"O: The gold standard for Double IPAs and it's worth seeking out and drinking whenever you have the chance. So easy to drink, such good flavor."
""
""
"I'm not going into details because it has been done in the other million reviews, but I will say that I feel this may have deserved its 100. Its hard for me to rate an IPA after having so many but my first drink made me literally say """Oh my God""" out loud. and I didn't want to take my last drink because that meant it would be over. That seems like something that deserves a 100. Awesome. Just awesome."
""
""
"Overall, this beer lives up to the reputation and the hype. It's definitely the best DIPA I've had...by far. Simply an amazing beer."
""
"O - AWESOME!!! A Brilliant Beer!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Wont really spend time describing this beer since everything has been said about it. I will add that this beer will change the way you drink, think and value craft beer. PtE drove me from being appreciative of good beer to an enthusiast. It brewed the curiosity for craft beer that eventually lead me to BeerAdvocate. Perfectly executed DIPA, perfectly executed beer. Tasty, boozy without the palate paying for it, and easy on the eye. The perfect beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pliny the elder was the first craft beer I had that made me fall in love with beer. It has a nice golden/amber color and nice thick creamy head. It has very citrusy aromas with grapefruit on the forefront. I have tried many other Dipa's since trying Pliny to better understand the style. Compared to 90 minute, sculpin, hop stupid, panzer wolf, dreadnaught, lagunitas sucks, and ruination none compare to Pliny and for that we must respect it. I am doing this review on Christmas day and I'm looking forward to the new year and February when the younger comes out (never had it). I am very fortunate to live in Sonoma county with Russian River so nearby. Happy holidays!"
"O - A joy to drink. The hype is worth it. Maybe not as one of the BIGGEST and BADDEST beers ever brewed, but certainly as one of the best strong, drinkable DIPAS ive ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Chuck’s into my Duvel Tulip. 12/02/11 batch. Pours somewhat murky golden orange with three fingers of white head. Smells of pine, grapefruit, hops, resin. It’s not intrusively bitter, but you can sense the hop presence. Smooth, crisp, refreshing front. Grapefruit citrus middle. Pine finish. Remarkably complex, and sits on the palate very well. Very well done IPA, certainly up there among my favorite. It’s an experience to say the least."
"Cheers, and Merry Christmas!"
""
"The craft beer scene has put out a lot of good IPAs recently; I would say some even surpass Pliny, but this beer will always be the standard by which those other beers are judged by. I've also had it in the bottle and it was also very good. If you haven't had this beer before, or if you haven't had it in a while, it's most definitely worth drinking."
""
""
"On tap at the Russian River brewbub in Santa Rosa Dec 22. Poured a deep amber, they actually handed it to me with out much head, but great lacing. Fantastic citrus pine hop aromas matched by the outstanding grapefruit, citrus pine taste. For me the mouthfeel was the most impressive aspect - how are they able to get such a juicy hop finish with it being so very dry at the same time? I was somewhat skeptical with all the hype, but this one (and every other RR beer I tried) was wonderful."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nectar from the gods. Absolutely phenomenal beer."
""
"DIPA's are usually not my first choice of beers, so the fact that I'm rating this at the level I am, certainly says something. It is one of the best looking beers around. That golden honey coloration with the orangish tinge creates a prism like quality. The citrus nose changes as it warms, with a floral undertone emerging. Taste is spectacular and the expected bite just isn't there. It smooth, clean and damn near perfect. While not a double, the only beer I have found to be better (in similar style), is Hill Farmstead's Edward. I'd love to try this one on tap, and patiently await the day when RR starts distributing in NY."
"O: Excellent DIPA. Not much else to add beyond what is already known about this beer. I Try to pick up fresh bottles when I see them, but being as popular as it is, both locally, & nationally to traders, even here is getting more & more scarce to get a bottle or two."

"Overall, as I've said many times, Pliny's not a bad beer, and if I had regular access to it, I'd probably drink it all the time. However, for me, a huge DIPA fan, this beer has always been a bit of a disappointment. I just don't understand the massive hype it gets, and when drinking it next to Heady Topper, it really pales in comparison. I'll always gladly drink Pliny, but the days of going out of my way for it are long gone."

"O: I wouldn't say this beer lived up to the hype or to its $7 price tag, but it is to date one of the best DIPAs I've had. I would definitely buy again, but for the price I would say there are some other beers out there that are a better choice."
""
""
""
"The cap came off and I was treated to what I can only describe as heaven in a bottle. No other beer has ever had such a wonderful aroma to me as Pliny. I poured this magnificent brew into a sniffer glass and was rewarded with a medium golden colored brew that gave a fingers worth of fluffy white head and good lacing. The well balanced aroma's of citrus, grass and pine pleasantly greet your nose. The taste is amazing, the crispness of citrus was perfectly balanced with a strong malt backbone that left a slightly sharp aftertaste on the tongue. Despite having a relatively high IBU count and above average ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable. I can't help but think, this is the perfect DIPA!"

"Have this on tap every time i go to falling rock tap house. The smell is just floral and fruity with pine and pot smells to it. Looks like a golden hazy cloud with great lacing to the glass. The taste is smooth as anything on the market with the mouth being full body. Top three IPA/DIPA in the us. cant beat the price at 5 a pint either"
""
"First of all, I would like to thank Callmecoon for sending me several fresh bottles of this incredible beer, you're the man. Secondly, I am a diehard Imperial Russian Stout fan and I never thought that I would find an American Double/Imperial IPA that I would enjoy until I tasted Russian River Brewing Company's Pliny the Elder. All I can say is WOW and what an outstanding beer! From the very first sip I feel in love with Pliny the Elder. The aroma and taste (fresh grapefruit) is truly something to behold and I am really impressed with this DIPA to say the least."

""
""

"O: So glad I got to try Pliny. It was much lighter than I expected-I could definitely drink three or four of these in one sitting. I can't wait to trade for some more."

"O: This was so good I had a pint all 4 nights we went out in SF. Delicious stuff but you have to be careful with it."
"O It's very refreshing, crisp, fruity, nice, but possibly a bit overhyped, but its pretty damn good. Great balance."
""
"Seek it out if you can."
""
"DOA"
""
""
"Great, great beer. I've had fresh drafts of this on the west coast and I think the flavors are even more vibrant out of a fresh keg. It's a brilliant thing RR has figured out here: fresh hops are better and the best way to keep beer fresh for your customers is to ensure that it flies off the shelves."

"O: I was very impressed with Pliny. I had a friend recommend this one and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Top marks."

"O - This is obviously a great beer for hop heads, but I can't think of a better beer to give to someone who doesn't like IPAs."
"O: I have enjoyed this DIPA for quite some time and finally got around to reviewing it. It's no wonder this is constantly rated as one of the best beers out there. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE: tried plenty more bottles, and really liked the last one I had. tasted like a drier Hopslam almost. Very citrusy in every aspect, and extremely delicious, so I'm updating the scores on this one to average it out."
""
""
""
"Overall: Absolutely delicious beer, and worthy of the praise. Slightly bitter for my personal tastes, but easy to see why this granddaddy has spurred so many imitators over the years. I will happily drink this anytime I get the opportunity, and hope to make it out to RR one day to try on tap."

""
""
""

""
"This is a really good double IPA. It isn't the blow away beer that I expected, but I do wonder if expectations could be met. I know it wasn't the freshest bottle, but it still is a quality beer"
""
""
""
"It is a magical moment in the WoodBrew household during this TG holiday....my bro-in-law brought a bottle of Pliney the Elder back from his summer trip out west. The beer pours a pale straw color with thin white head that is lacing. The smell is fresh hop with pine foundation, in addition there is some caramel malt undertones. The taste is very balanced between malt and hop...very smooth. Once the drink goes down a pine followed by grapefruit finish on the pallet. The mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall the beer is fantastic."
""
""
""
"This is supposed to be a hop ride - and it meets its mark. There's Simcoe all over it and a couple other big C hops. If you like hops, this is a monster that will please you - especially when it warms. But there's a couple other hop monsters I've had that are more more balanced in their approach. PTE hits you like a 300 pound defensive lineman, where some other double IPAs have at least the grace of the dancing hippos in Disney's Fantasia."
"O- In my opinion this thing lives up to the hype. It's a great beer. Something I would love to be drinking everyday. Just brings me back home to Northern California. Legend."
"Next?: Blind Pig 2 days after Thanksgiving!!!! YEAH!"
"HV"
""
"Really, I can't add much to what's been said. I had this last year and wanted to say it's the measuring stick other Imp IPA's are compared to. Too bad for them. If you haven't tried it, find it. I pray Russian River continues to make this beer, call them, beg them."

"Poured into a typical pint glass. Golden/ yellow in color, very clean, no sediment. A fingers width of off white head that laces perfectly all the way through. Smells great.. Grape fruit forward, citrus and piney hops. Taste is very good.. Slightly bittering, hop forward.. A bit grainy, grapefruit, and citrus. Slightly bittering aftertaste, hop character lingering. I love this beer and run to any event that pours it."

"It has a huge creamy head with a lot of lacing. The hops jump out in the aroma as well as grapefruit, honey, and pine. I was expecting a bigger punch from the hops. Instead it's quite balanced. Good hop bitterness throughout but not overpowering at all. Nice tones of grapefruit, a honey warmness from the alcohol (8%). For an IPA it's creamy as well. Honestly, for such a big IPA, it's extremely drinkable. It finishes very cleanly with just a bit of bitterness on the tongue. And an earthy exhale of pine and clove."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear golden slightly orange coloring with a solid, slightly rocky head that follows with a good lacing. Fruity nose (pineapple, orange, grapefruit) with slight floral undertones.

"O: This beer is like no others. I'm hesitant to give that perfect score but... I've had all of the other beers that would try to take PtEs crown but I honestly felt they have fallen SLIGHTLY short in other ways. This has been (for years) one of my favorite beers and even as my palate has grown it has stayed one of my favorites. I implore anyone who hasn't tried this before... take a trip out to Santa Rosa, CA... hit the brewpub order some pliny bites and a pint of this. You won't regret it!"
"O: You need to have this beer, right now. It is amazing."
"I'm not easy to please but this one is more or less the holy grail of IPAs in my book."
"The taste is awesome! It's tart and prickly from the hops, but still maintains a nice malty smoothness with cookie-like flavors underneath the bite. I get big flavors of lemon, grapefruit, and kiwi with some subtle hints of biscuit, honey, and butter underneath. It has a nice, firm mouthfeel without being creamy. It lacks that sweetness that a few IIPAs have that can make them taste medicinal. I didn't drink another beer this night because I wanted to see if I'd still be tasting this one the next day (I did)."
"Overall - This is, without a doubt, completely deserving of a world class rating within the DIPA category! As I said in the taste section, I don't know that it could get any better than this. I made the trip to Russian River Brewery on a whim and boy am I glad I did. Pliny the Elder is simply amazing! Cheers!"
"Overall- Excellent and lives up to its name. Very drinkable. I would love to head out to California to try the younger."
"This was my first attempt at a beer review, and I was hesitant to display my ignorance, particularly on such a revered beer. But I was glad I did, as doing so made me slow down and savor the beer, exploring its intricacies and appreciating what it had to offer."
"O: Not only my favorite IPA, but ultra-fair price."
"Bright orange in color with a thick, creamy, white head. Tons of citrus and fresh hops in the aroma. Very appealing. The flavor lived up to my hopes. Strong, bitter grapefruit and pineapple that is nicely balanced out by bready malts. Rings along the side of the tulip glass all the way down. So drinkable for a double IPA. Not usually my favorite style, but this beer won me over. World class, a must try."
"Lives up to the hype which is rare. A citrus/grapefruit bomb, but nicely balanced and very drinkable. Very hoppy and definitely not a sweet DIPA, maybe a bit thin for a DIPA. IMO just a notch below 2008 Hopslam in overall greatness, and much better than the 2008/2010 Hopslam which IMO seemed a tad too sweet. The only problem is obviously distribution and freshness. I would guess most styles like this the hop hit would fade quickly, I'm sure a two month old Pliny wouldn't be as good as as 30 day brew. But by trade or by internet store a must try for any IPA lover, and reasonable too. If I lived in Ca I'd have year round it's that good. Sane ABV levels too."
"This is West Coast Double IPA."
"O: This IS Double IPA, everything else is """a"" DIPA"
"O - Pliny lives up to the hype. End of story. The hops is definately in the forefront, and the beer is extremely drinkable! I don't know how else to say one of the best IPAs ever. Thanks again to scottfrie, A+ trader!"
"My favorite IPA I've ever had. It is such an explosion of floral grapefruity notes and the hops just keep coming and coming with no bitter aftertastes. A pleasant sweet malty mouthfeel is also balanced in there. I live in Michigan so I have to always have the homebrewed version of this at all times in the keggerator. A++++"
"Quintessential example of a west coast DIPA."
"Clearly a classic; powerful pine hops that permeates every inch of this brew but still maintains an elegant balance. One of the best. (No surprise there)."
"O - Exceptional IPA that is very crisp, refreshing and very well balanced. I would highly recommend it if you can find it."
"O - What can be said? It's Pliny. I can't wait to try this on tap to see if it can be better."
"Best DIPA I've had."
"D - I'm honestly surprised. A combination of midwest (Three Floyds) bias and the belief that Pliny might be overshadowed by newer DIPA entries left me expecting something not nearly as delectable as this. Pliny's hop character is considerably better than what I find in FFF Dreadnaught but Pliny doesn't achieve the same level of balance. Honestly, I'm not sure this bothers me. It is a great, great offering and finally, FINALLY, I can say I've tried a Russian River brew. :)"
"Overall: This is one of the highest rated beers in the world for a reason. This is a really balanced and drinkable beer that is really well executed."
"O: I absolutely love this beer! I wish I had access to it because it would be a weekly beer for me. I totally recommend this to any hops fan. Grab it while you can!"
"O- I dont like buying into hype at all but this beer is excellent. Glad my dad sends me these on the reg."
"Overall: When I opened the bottle and started pouring the aroma blew me away. My mouth was watering like a St Bernard. The taste was sublime with the all the great hops and sweet citrus tones. All around phenomenal brew. Cheers!"
"**Hard to find, easy to drink: Only negative is that it's not available in Pittsburgh!**"
" Overall like i said in the beginning my favorite Ipa/Dipa i have had to date everything about this beer leaves me craving another. And given the fact that its extremely drinkable i can have a couple more. Everyone should try this beer at some point in there travels. It lives up to its hype."
"O) It took me a while before I ran into this, even living in San Diego. I went into it knowing the surrounding hype. It did not let me down. While it's definitely a benchmark dipa it's one I will only have from time to time to savor :)"
"O- If we had more IPAs like this in the area I would be hard pressed to pick between RIS and IPAs. But as RISs can last longer I have to stick with them. Still nice to have again."
"Overall- Vinnie has destroyed the constraints of the DIPA. There is nothing like this anywhere. I do see however some striking differences in the reviews of the persons who got this on draft...I will have to go to the brewery to try it out and see."
"For the style, this is nearly perfect, certainly the gold standard for DIPAs as far as I'm concerned."
"Overall, yeah, it's that good."
"O - Great aroma and flavor! Everything a strong IPA should be. I can see why this beer is so popular!"
"O - World class for a reason. There are other DIPA's that are perhaps stronger in 1 area or another, but this one remains king for overall impression."
"What more can be said about Pliny? It made DIPAs drinkable and was the first IPA I had that I thought I could introduce my wife to, who, at the time, hated hoppy beers. The complexity cannot be overstated, especially for a beer style that is known for just kicking you in the face. The guys at RR know what the hell they're doing with this beer, being delicate but still saying something strong and loud at the same time."
"MF: Perfectly fits the style. Drinkable, likable, not sweet or syrupy. This is a drinking, not sipping beer."
"At this point in my quest to find my favorite DIPA, this ranks right up there. There are many that have better taste profile, but drinkability and aftertaste quality of this beer is exceptional."
"Thanks to furthurgone for this in trade!"
"Overall Impression- Thanks again Mark! This is one of my favorite IPA's once again (go figure). I did enjoy it more on-tap back this summer and this may have been due to how fresh it was @ Naja's Place. Either way, get your hands on this one! Perfect grapefruit and citrus taste."
"Overall: I’m left with the question of “Is this what they mean when they refer to “Left Coast IPA’s”. It was different than most of the IPA’s I’m used to, being from the Midwest. Not bad, just different. I’m not saying I didn’t enjoy the beer but it was not quite what I expected from all the hype that surrounds it. HopSlam is another very hyped up beer but that exceeded the hype for me, this did not. The best I can describe this beer is “Simple Elegance”. No bells, whistles, bourbon or brandy barrel aging. Just straight away hops and kick a$$ IPA."
"What an awesome brew this is. I picked up 12 (fresh) bottles last year or so while in Oregon and thought it was a great brew. I just scored another (fresh) bottle this week and it's certainly better than I remembered. It poured a nice hazy orangy color which I love but others seem to deduct points for. I'm right, they're wrong. The hops and malt seem to be in balance with neither standing above the other. While this is an exceptional DIPA, there are a couple out there that are better (but not many). This is certainly a beer that I would pay a premium for and if it were available to me on a regular basis, I would drink the shit out of it. I like that the price point is reasonable for the quality of the brew."
"Overall-Ive never really been a big drinker of IPA or DIPA until recently and ive had quite a few different ones throughout the months and i have to say this one is by far my top 3. Probably could be the number one. Theyre rather easy for me to aquire being that i live fairly close to the brewery so i have 5 in the fridge right now. Picked up three today. A great beer and fine DIPA, everyone should at least try this beer. Drinking a fresh opened bottle poured into a pint glass or pilsner glass nice and cold tastes better than the beer on tap. In my opinion."
"Overall, this was a delight. More, please."
"The archetypal DIPA; got this from bstaffor today in a box for a BIF and wasted no time at all opening it up. Could not ask for more from the appearance. About 2 fingers of bright white head sits on top of a clear golden beer. Amazing lacing and extremely long lasting head. Aroma is very nice as well. Big grapefruit citrus hop bomb. Very clean, very grapefruit, very citrus. Taste is great as well, clean, pretty dry, very citrus hop forward, with a big bitterness that follows everything else. Very enjoyable. Screw balance, this beer is all about the hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for an 8% beer, with mid-high carb. Overall what a great beer. Not usually the biggest DIPA fan, but I have been looking forward to trying this for a long time. Damn good beer. Was looking for problems and flaws, but really couldn't find any."
"It's not life-changing to me, but it's pretty darn good."
"The appearance is lighter in color, but don’t let that fool you. The aromas are intense. The taste lingers and lingers in your mouth, way after swallowing it. It has a more refined blending of flavors from top to bottom. Definitely a beer you have to drink at least once in your lifetime. You can tell there was a lot of time and effort put into this. There are other IPAs from California that can match this in robustness, but they can’t touch it in elegance."
"O : Nothing original in this beer despite its rarity, but a very good balance between the sweetness of the malts, the aromas from the hops and the bitterness. Brewed with mastery !"
"There are other very good DIPAs out there, and this certainly stands among them. While I wanted to share in the lauding of this beer as one of the best-of-the-best, my humble estimation was a bit less."
"Note: Final number ratings directly relate to the better and most fresh of two (10/04/11) bottles."
"I'm so glad I got to try this hyped up beer thats unavailable to IL residents. But it was not as good as I expected or hoped for."
"Nice oily hoppy mouth coating, alcohol lingers on the finish. Very nice!"
"O-The aroma to flavor transition is terrific. A good breath through the nose during a drink prepares the palate for the beer. The lasting bitterness that sticks to the palate makes your mouth water for another drink."
"O: Very drinkable, really well balanced beer. Not overly bitter like many in this style."
"O: Extremely drinkable IIPA that surprises the taste buds by never reaching the anticipated bitterness and concealing its ABV quite well. I have been able to secure two more from this batch and am looking forward to enjoying them very soon. It is a real treat for the senses."
"-Overall awesome IPA that every fan of this type of ale should have on their want list"
"Fresh Pliny, consumed last Friday. This was actually the first fresh Pliny I have recieved. Served in a New Belgium tulip glass. The Head and glass retention was perfect. The smell was piny and a little floral scent. The taste was phenomenal. Grapefruit, pine, and HOPs!! The abv very well hidden. It blew the doors off all the other Pliny I have had. Fresh Pliny is where it's at!! love it!! Thanks Riko for the extra!"
"Poured into a New Belgium globe. Perfect,golden cream colored frothy, silky head. It dissipates some, but leaves a thin yet frothy layer as it goes down. Massive sticky lacing on the glass. The smell is bold, a combination of pine and citrus, a very clean aroma that's not overpowering. I'll admit, i don't drink a lot of IPAs or DIPAs, but this beer is extremely tasty. Again, the pine, citrus, grapefruit flavors are all well balanced and work harmoniously. The mouthfeel is crisp, smooth, and for lack of a better word, perfect. Overall, I waited a long time to try this beer, and in fact I had to overpay for it on Ebay just to get it. To say that I was skeptical is an understatement, as this beer has reached mythical status. But I can attest to it's reputation, this is a fine, fine beer. I'll probably never have it again due to the price, but I'm glad I got to see what all of the fuss was about. I don't drink DIPAs usually, but surely, this one is King."
"This beer is magic. While I prefer it just a touch on tap, it is still excellent in the bottle. It never gets old. This is one you MUST try."
"D. The hype is real. This is as smooth and complexly balanced as a beer can beer."
"O - This is on my top 5 list when it concerns IIPAs. The most drinkable and well rounded IIPA I've come across. Until you drink one, you won't know that the hype surrounding this beer is not really hype at all."
"Glassware: 550ml bottle into snifter."
"O: This is definitely a top tier beer. Strong and bold yet very well rounded and drinkable. PtE lets all components of the beer shine in a wonderfully structured balance. The price tag on these is refreshingly affordable. This kind of offering at a $4.99 price tag is more than well worth it, and a definite treat."
"This beer pours a golden clear color with a white head that leaves very good lacing on the glass. Extremely attractive beer. The nose is mainly citrus and pine notes with a very slight malt character barely present. Citrus and grapefruit upfront with some very potent but welcomed pine notes. Great mouthfeel with a medium body, creaminess and a bitter cling that sticks to your mouth. Its a great beer that I'm thankful to have access to."
"This is dangerously drinkable, and ranks among my very favorite IPAs. Having it the first time at Russian River was a treat."
"Overall, seek this great beer out as it is amazing fresh and relatively easy to trade for!"
"What more needs to be said? If you're a hop-head and haven't had this, that'll need to be remedied immediately. As others have said, a damn near perfect DIPA; go see for yourself, Cheers!"
"Anyway, from a midwestern standpoint, i'd like to see a few more examples with the spicy, smooth bitterness this beer provides. there are some great 2xipas in the area that showcase great flavor and aroma but they seem to get weak in the knees when it comes to giving the beer that final ibu burst."
"O: A very well made, delicious DIPA. The hype behind it carries through the beer itself."
"O: The definitive DIPA. The flavors evolved through warming of the 500mL bottle, but were always enjoyable. I have trouble thinking of over DIPAs I would pick to drink ahead of this. There are no flaws in this beer, and I will continue to drink it at every possible opportunity."
"O: Great stuff. I'd definitely drink it again!"
"Overall, I think it was a great beer. I just don't think I can buy in the hype all of you have been raving about. I think the rarity of the beer, and the fact that it's difficult for anyone to get this, has slightly artificially push this beer to mythic status. I wouldn't go out of my way to trade for this beer, I'm just saying, that I can find some more IPAs that are just as good!"
"overall--worth trying for sure. its rarity definitely hypes up people's taste buds, but it's so well balanced and delicious it's hard to fault people for doing so."
"Enjoy!!"
"Drinks very easy for a double IPA, can't believe it is 8% ABV. Very well worth seeking out and drinking fresh."
"Overall: An exceptionally drinkable imperial IPA. This beer is big in every way and yet it is perfectly balanced. True art in a glass."
"O- for being a top rated beer on a lot of forums, I'm disappointed. I've had plenty of IPAs that are both comparable and better overall."
"At 8% this is deceptively drinkable. It does not demand your attention like more DIPAs. This is clearly the best of its style, I only wish it were more accessible."
"O: Simply an amazing offering. It is clear this was created by a deft hand. The heights one can ascend to when they become a master if their craft."
"Pliney is an exceptional IPA and deserves all the credit that that it is given."
"Well, my world wasn’t shattered, but it’s not hard to see why others clamor for this beer. Very tasty, very drinkable. There are better DIPAs out there, but not many."
"My dad is now obsessed and compares every beer to Pliny, so rediculous but nessesary."
"I've been a fan of ipas for awhile now and after having this beer it has set a whole new standard for me as far as ipa's go. Pliny and ruination are my top two favorite beers. Pliny has the lead a little because sometimes ruination can have a little bit to much bitterness to it. love the color of this beer pours a nice clear burnt orange and the hop scent for it is spot on perfect. because of this beer I now know that simcoe hops are the bomb and I'm always on the hunt for beers that have that piney simcoe taste."
"Fresh Pliny is out of this world. Definitely one of the best DIPAs around. Pours a medium amber color with sticky white head. Aroma explosion of citrus and pine. Straight dankness all around. Fruity and piney with a sweet malt backbone on the tongue. Hop profile marinates and lingers. Medium bodied. Deserves its reputation as being one of the best DIPAs in the world."
"Cheers"
"Beautiful, almost dayglo, orange with a thick sticky white head. Smell is pure hops. Lots of pine and grapefruit, very clean with almost no vegetal or malt aroma. Taste blasts you with bitterness. It is strongly bitter but again very clean. The hops dominate with more pine and grapefruit which are so strong it was hard for me to detect much subtlety behind them. Everything about this beer is super clean which lets the strong hops and bitterness shine, front and center. Good carbonation and a very easy drinking beer. Overall this is a great beer. I didn't give perfect scores for smell and taste because I like a bit more complexity but what is there is very strong and clear and enjoyable."
"Pouring from the bottle, one is immediatley struck by the yellowish orange color of the beer. Notes of hops, pine, and citrus are striking in the aroma. Even before tasting, it is very apparent that this is not your average beer. The beer is uncommonly smooth. The hops and well balanced with the smooth texture. There is potential for this beer to go down easy, and consume in mass quantities. It is not an IPA, just for the sake of being hoppy. Pliny the Elder is not trying to out-hop other beers. It has a unique flavor and texture which sets it apart. A well designed beer."
"Pours a clear orangish gold. Nice sized head. Lacing on the surface and sides. Smell is huge piney, citrusy, and spicy hops. Cloves, lemons, and grapefruit. Taste is tremendously hoppy and sharply bitter. Bitter grapefruit. Resinous. Piney. Hops overpower everything throughout. Some sweet maltiness far in the background. Lingering bitterness. Full bodied. A bit boozy. Well carbonated. Overall a hop powerhouse. Really great stuff- an awesome DIPA."
"An amazing fresh and hoppy beer. In the top five for me, although I am a hop head! Hard to find though. I have discovered most stores keep this in the managers or stewards office. The aroma is a truely fresh hoppy one that Is hard to come by. I would love to travel to the brewery in sana rosa"
"Overall a very nice DIPA. I've had it several times and this by far was the best I've had. Whatever tweak they might have done has made it better balanced."
"O: This was a little disappointing with all the hype surrounding it, but it was still a very delicious beer nonetheless."
"O- Very good IPA, but not sure it is the greatest beer ever like most people think. However, I would drink this regularly if I had access to it."
"Hope to try some fresh some time, hopefully in California!"
"I could literally drink this all day."
"Overall: It definitely lived up to its hype, I would love to try a fresher version though. At a month old it was pretty much on the decline at this time, but it was still phenomenal."
"A solid beer. World Class, maybe? A seriously refreshing drink, just wish it wasn't so hard to get."
"Overall- This beer completely lived up to everything that I thought it was going to. A crazy powerful hoppy taste. Wish this beer was on the East Coast. Cheers!"
"O: Top-flight DIPA lives up to its billing. One of the top beers I've ever had for sure."
"Incredibly hoppy without being harsh or bitter. Just an outstanding beer that lives up to the hype."
"I always thought the freshness thing was a little ridiculous. I get that a beer, especially an IPA should be fresh, but the difference between 2 week old Pliny and maybe a few days old Pliny is ridiculous. Love Pliny in the bottle or at your local beer bar? Try some fresh from the source. Incredible."
"O: This last month has been hop heaven for me and this one holds it's own with the best of them. Extremely drinkable for the higher ABV. I happily drink this everytime Fedex brings it my way. Top tier hop bomb."
"Awesome beer, not much else to say about this one. Great balance, great hops, great drinkability, great beer."
" Overall, this beer totally lives up to the hype for me. It's simply one of the best beers I've ever had, and I'm glad I finally got to try it. If you have a chance- try this beer.. and as the bottle says, """Respect your Elder"""."
"Overall- DAMN good beer! There are things that I wish were better about it, but those are so small I hate to even say anything. There is a reason why everyone uses Pliny as the benchmark for DIPAs. 4.5/5"
"O: It lived up to the hype, even traveling across the US to get here it kept it taste and smell. Wish they made this is 6 packs that I could get around here... Wait... Columbus IPA...."
"O - This is a wonderful IIPA by RR that definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. This is the third time I have had the pleasure of tasting it, and it has never disappointed. The particular hop flavors that come forward are superbly balanced by great malt character."
"I made tasting this beer a bit of an 'event.' In a Glencairn Scotch glass to get more of the nose... which was a very complex & reminiscent of a spring meadow and sweet nectar. The taste lived up to the hype as well as the amazing aroma- hops of course up front, with a juicy citrus right in the middle of the flavor, finishing nicely with a pleasant bitterness. Did I mention fresh?? it's ever so fresh, it reminds me of drinking the purest bottled water. What's amazing about this beer is how balanced it is, and how the alcohol is masked... almost every IPA is somewhat undrinkable 'all day' in that it is not refreshing - it gives you a dry mouth after a while. This is quite the opposite... What sort of witchery is this??"
"4's on the board. I think this one might have been a little old... probably about 3-4 months old... it was a bit ago and I didn't write down the bottle date so I can't tell you exactly how old it was. Regardless... poured a slightly hazy orange color with a finger of foamy white head that retained pretty well and left a little lacing. The aroma had notes of citrus and piney hops, with some sweet caramel thrown in. Not as much hop aroma as I would've liked, but see above. The taste was nice and balanced, nothing too overly present. There were notes of caramel, pine, citrus and some grassy hops. The mouthfeel was relatively smooth and finished clean. Overall a great beer... would have liked to try a slightly fresher one."
"Overall this is truly an exceptional, world class beer. Whether or not it's the greatest-of-all-time DIPA...well I haven't had them all so I can't say. Is it the best I've ever had...hells ya! I'm glad I have another in the fridge. Thanks again jimmy2282. This is a damn good beer. Cheers!"
"Overall...like I said I am not uncovering anything new..just afforming the fact that this is one world class beer that everyone should try.."
"Overall - Well-hyped, but worth the hype. It delivered and I wish I could get this on the regular. I long for more of this top-notch west coast IPA. I would love to find this on tap."
"I could drink this beer all day, all night. For real. I have lost the ability to sound unbiased. I love this beer! This is my favorite beer of all time!! Try it--you will LOVE it!"
"The medium carbonation is perfect. The body is on the higher side of medium, and is light enough to make this beer quite drinkable. Overall an absolutely outstanding beer. Not much more to be said..."
"**Bottled on date: 08 18 11"
"O: A good IIPA all the way around"
"O- this is by far the best DIPA from an availability standpoint."
"Fill it up again! Fill it up again! Once it hits your lips, it's so good. Its so good."
"Overall: I am not particularly a fan of hop loaded beers, however, this beer manages to be hoppy without toning down the flavors and aromas of the other ingredients. This has rarely been the case with other previous experiences i have had with IPA's. Excellent beer."
"Poured a golden orange, filtered, with a fluffy white head that fades to some moderate head with great lacing. Nose has some bready grains and pungent citrus hops, unique to anything I've ever put my nose to before. Resiny, tropical fruits and pine all come through in varying degrees. Awesome. Taste has more tropical fruits, bitter pine notes and some sweet maltiness in a lightly sugary way working its magic secondary to the hops. Light alcohol as the sip fades away. Nice medium body, dry finish on every sip. Very bitter finish. Great drinkability, and everything I had expected from this - the gold standard from what I want in a drier DIPA. Fantastic, and I can only imagine this being divine when on tap. Get me more."
"Great Great IPA, I actually liked the flavor of blind pig a bit more but Russian River brews are some of the best I've ever had."
"On tap at the Horse Brass in Portland a couple weeks ago. It absolutely lives up to every accolade ever written. Not only is it the most balanced and refreshing IPA I've ever had, but the hop flavors, my god, it was unlike anything I have ever tasted. They melded together into one unified lupulin note that rode a delicious juicy malt wave down my tongue. No harsh bitterness or alcohol present. A true hop artwork that never strays too far in any one direction but stays perfectly focused on its expression of the hop."
"Overall this beer lives up to the hype. The most balance and mellowness in an ipa I've found."
"Overall- This is my 3rd time having Pliny and I believe that this is one amazing beer. This beer is the standard by which all DIPA's should be measured by. An amazing experience."
"Overall I now understand why this is considered the standard by how other Imperial IPAs are judged. It is incredibly hoppy and has pretty much everything you could hope for in terms of hop flavors yet it is balanced nicely by the malt. Well worth the hype"
"O: Definitely in my top 3 beers of all time, possibly #1. I had this side by side with Pliny the Younger and it's really just about as good. It may not be quite as intense, but the flavor and balance is perfect. Everyone who likes hops needs to try this beer."
"[O] - This beer is the standard I judge all other DIPA's on. There are only a few that I've tried so far that I've enjoyed better (the Younger definitely being one of them)."
"O: While this was a solid DIPA, the taste was a little bit of a let down compared to the nose. I was expecting a big, bold hop profile, but it was rather soft and subdued with just a little bitterness. It kind of reminded me of the difference between Hill Farmstead's Citra DIPA and the Abner/Galaxy (Citra soft while Abner/Galaxy was just huge and in your face). Perhaps this is indeed a tame batch, I'll definitely give the next batch another try. Best DIPA I've ever had? Not this bottle, no. Great, but not the best."
"I must say this beer was everything and nothing I expected. After enjoying Unearthly from Southern Tier and realizing how amazing its Pineapple and Fresh hops qualities were, I told myself theres no way someone can top this. Pliny did. I know its hyped up, but it deserves to be. I gave the appearance a 5 because I love me some cloudiness. The aroma and taste was there but some about the mouthfeel told me 4.5. However! Definitely a dangerous beer. Do what you can to get it. New Yorkers should pick up Unearthly as a sneak peek. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Poured a very nice copper color with excellent head and some very nice lacing. Very nice scent, with a huge hoppiness right up in the nose (pine and some citrus), and some decent maltiness behind it. Nice flavors, with a nice two-row malty sweetness and a huge piney and slight citrusy hop flavor that is very much in front; good overall, but very unbalanced, even considering the style. Goes down fine, but there is quite a bit of hop scratchiness."
"O - While I wouldn't say it is the best beer in the country, as Zymurgy magazine boasts, this is definitely a world-class beer. Maybe the best IPA I've had to date, but it's not something godly as some make it out to be. The ABV, though not incredibly high, is quite deceiving. You can easily put back a few of these in quick succession. Highly enjoyable."
"O - I really see why this is at the top of the list on BA. I've been a huge DIPA fan and I love Stone's offerings, but this just rocks my world. So complex and original in the genre, with its perfect balance and drinkability."
"O- One of my favorite DIPAs. So easy to drink and enjoyable. This beer is very well priced that i'm constantly blown away. This 500mL was $4, other DIPAs that people claim to rival PtE are often twice as much and don't come close. Always easy to find when visiting my CA family. This bottle is a bit different then on tap at RR, but still great."
"This is that now and this is that then. Wow."
"O: Excellent iipa that possibly lives up to the hype. Satisfying in every area, this beer is fantastic. Salivating and mouth watering. Yes I would defiantly buy this beer again and recommend ever time I found appropriate."
"O/D – This beer has made me forget what a crap long day/night I had at the funeral home today (this usually takes at least two brews). It is perfectly balanced and lives entirely up to what I’ve heard. A standing ovation for duff27 for providing me with yet another liquid, hoppy gem."
"This beast pours a hazy copper and yellow colored body with about a half inch of foamy, sticky, ghost white head. Ample wet lacing is left in its wake. The nose is greeted with a blast of lemon, grapefruit, other citrus, and hops. Some grass, straw, and piney scents make up the rear. Already, this one screams """big, west-coast DIPA.""" The taste begins with a rush of bitter hops, pine, and straw before lemon and citrus take over. Really just a well balanced, thought out brew. Being so fresh, the malt is nearly indistinguishable, and that is perfectly fine. I wouldn't change a thing about this tasteful experience. Mouth is crisp, refreshing, hop-sweltering, and finishes a touch dry. Overall, an incredible DIPA that lives up to its legacy."
"Overall: Superb IIPA and most certainly the best I have had to date. I hope to visit the states one day and have a super fresh bottle."
"On-tap at HopMonk in Sonoma. It's a luscious golden amber with light highlights, a firm head and impressive lacing which lasted all the way down the glass. The smell is pine and floral and citrus and the taste is the same--hops hops hops! Hops hops hops! Bitterness! Flowers, citrus, pine! Just a little bit of cracker malt and a long slow dry finish. Lingering spice. I have had a lot of hop bombs before but what sets this apart is the mouthfeel--medium bodied with good carbonation and no alcohol feel or even that much sting, just hoppy goodness. Lives up to the hype."
"O - Overall this has to be one of the best DIPA's around. Such rich flavors and aroma make this a pure breed winner in many ways. Makes you want more from the first sip!"
"One of my all-time favorites, how I've missed thee so. You still rock my world."
"This beer pours a nice straw color with a nice white head. nose is grassy, citrus, and resin. Taste is super clean ask balance malt and hops with clean bitter finish. Over all drinking this beer is bitter-sweet, it is amazing but the fact that its impossible to get it in New England. Would definitely go out of my way to drink again."
"O) This one lives up to the hype and then some. My only regret is having just two bottles left to enjoy."
"Maybe I'll get the chance to come back and revisit this guy later and I'll be more impressed?!"
"Pale golden orange, one finger of white head, nice tight lace left on the glass. Smell is ripe with citrus, grapefruit, tangerine and orange are all present, some light pine note are present, white grape skins, nice malt profile is there as well, tons of hops and hop oils present. Taste is bursting with citrus fruit, grapefruit, lots of orange and tangerine, lots of hop bitterness, some pine in the finish, long drying finish, after a while the bitterness almost subsides into a complex balanced beer unlike anything I have tasted. Light-med carb, full body, lots of resiny oils, great feel, nice weight. Overall this is near perfection, ABV can not be tasted, very drinkable, certainly lives up to its reputation, absolutely outstanding."
"Good carbonation and great drinkability round up this greatly crafted beer!"
"Look, I didn’t want to hop on the bandwagon, and give this beer a A+. However, this really has to be the best IPA I have ever had. I'm a big fan of the style to begin with. So I'm pretty picky about my IPA's. First sip I was convinced. Delicious beer, you have to try it."
"O - A fantastic beer. Hard to beat on any account. Some may like more hops, some more malts, some more alcohol, but this beer just gets all 3 perfect."
"O:This is a great beer, no doubt. If you can get it on tap, that is the way to go, but if not, no big deal, still a great beer in a bottle also."
"If you can get this beer, do it!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Man, I've been waiting to try this for quite some time, and I can honestly say that it holds up to the hype. I prefer my DIPA's to be hop forward, and not overly malty or thick. This delivers. Actually reminds me a bit of Hopslam. Not identical, but they're similar."
"O - Not the first time I've had PTE, but this brew never lets me down. Its easy to see what the rage is about. Believe the hype!"
"D - Delicious brew. An almost perfect double IPA. This is my first tasting, so I'm looking forward to trying a bottle next."
"*Adding to previous review-had this in bottle format. Totally taste the grapefruit now, and the pine mixed together makes for a splendid smelling and tasting beer. Top notch!"
"This would certainly be my go to brew if I lived close enough. There are many who could learn from this fine beer."
"O - Overall this is a delicious IPA. I wish I could get this legit fresh, like, tapped at the brewery fresh. Alas, that just isnt meant to be. A very good IPA."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the overt grapefruit in the nose. They really showcased big citrus in the hop department here, making for not only a robust flavoring, but a unique beer in the sense that it didn’t really blend the hops, but rather had them all sing on their own. This is a standup beer for the style, and is something we could sip the summer away with."
"I was psyched when I saw it on tap at SDBC, since we were there only five days before and it wasn’t. This beer definitely lived up to the reputation. What a wonderful beer!"
"O- I really like IPA's and Double IPA's and basically any beer that is hoppy. This beer is definitely in my top ten favorite beers of all time. I might like the stone double dry hopped ruination a little better because of the super dry finish it has, but this is beer has definitely become one of my fav's. Cheers!"
"Overall: The perfect blend of complex flavors coming together for a beer that lives up to its legend. One of the best IPAs by far...grab them when you can! Finally a beer worthy of five stars."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Easy drinking and very oily with hops. So bitter yet so enjoyable. Very drying on the tongue thy promotes an easy transition into the next sip. This is without a doubt the brightest and more fresh sampling of Elder I have ever had. Pretty much the only way to top this experience would be to go to the source the day a new batch is released. Thanks a bunch Dan for sharing!"
"Drank this about a week after the bottle date. The experience was very similar to a tap session with Pliny at Hollingshead a few days before."
"O - Love this beer. As I said earlier, it does live up to the hype."
"This is the bar. This is what all other Double IPAs should strive to achieve."
"O: By far the best IPA I've ever had. It lives up to the hype and then some."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall this is a very good enjoyable beer, the best Imperial IPA have experienced, however, I feel that it is a slightly over-hyped beer."
"Laces throughout the whole glass. Smells of pine, citrus, and hops....glorious hops. I have enjoyed Pliny many times before, but this time there was a sweet taste I experienced, almost pineapple or grapefruit like, but very hoppy on the back end. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with the perfect amount of carbonation dancing on your tongue. Overall, I would say this is a very classy brew. Might I add that although this is my first time reviewing Pliny The Elder, I have enjoyed it on numerous occasions. I was lucky enough to try it before I even knew that such a site called Beer Advocate existed, learning off all the hype that surrounded this wonderful brew after my first taste. Let me tell you, this brew has stood up to, if not exceeded its own hype. Cheers."
"O: Great DIPA. I understand the following, but still think many of the Michigan offerings stack up just as well. Glad I have got to have this twice now."
"This beer (especially for the price: $4) was no disappointment. It is a truly artistic chemistry of hop flavors, and I would never have imagined such a balace of skunk, pine, and citrus. I spent the day at my aunt and uncles, with cousins, young and old hanging off of my arms and shoulders. I think that the next time I drink this beer, I will zoom back to this moment in my imagination: the first day that I tasted Pliny. Cheers."
"Sustained Taste: Became slightly bitter as it warmed, meant to be consumed rather quickly I think."
"This is a beer that truly lives up to the hype. I can only look forward to having it again at some point."
"The appearance was great and the nice piney hoppy aroma really had me going, but the taste just fell a little bit flat in the mouth to me. It tasted good initially, but those bitter hoppy flavors I was craving just didn't seem to stick to the palate long enough for me for an imperial."
"A nearly perfect beer. I used a pint glass as nothing else was available. The balance of hops to malt was just right. The appearance seemed right for a beer with less flavor. It looked like a lesser beer but hit hard. Just before the bitterness seems about to hit you it backs off. This makes you wonder why out of so many others, this beer stands out. The main theme I get is balance. Every characteristic of a great IPA exists here and sets the bar for the style. It is also fun I might add."
"O- I feel absolutely spoiled that I live in a place where I can get this without difficulty. I've had this on tap at the brewery, in a bottle, on tap at local bars, and I really just can't get enough of the sweet, sweet nectar. A perfect IIPA. Perhaps even the greatest. Get it any way you can."
"Overall - World Class but lethal - make other beers seem pale in comparison. If I had one last beer before I died this might be it but it is not my go to beer most likely has it can quickly wreck havoc on a man's ego as it quickly turns a man into a boy and then girl with giddiness."
"Overall - A world class beer is all one hears when Pliny gets its name dropped. Has it lived up too the legend for me though, almost I've got to say the only thing that brings it down is the sweetness it has too it making it a bit much by itself I'd like to pair it with food and see if that takes the edge off on the finish. That said its a hard beer to get but if your in northern CA or know someone that can send you one grab it for yourself."
"A lot lighter on the mouthfeel than I would suspect hits the tongue just a tad light, but has a nice redeeming creaminess that comes out as the beer glides over the palate. Maybe it's just my palate, but I've had it a bunch of times and don't understand all the fuss? oh well to each his own. A very solid beer worth $4.99 a 500ml i guess."
" The mouth feel is bubbly and welcoming. Not cloying at all despite the extremely sweet smell. Excellent mouth feel. This beer clocks in at 8%, wheres the booze? No, and i mean no alcohol taste what so ever. This beer is dangerous!"
"I bought a case of Pliny. I'd like to share before I drink myself to death. Seriously, I came home and had 3 of them last night after going to my favorite biergarten. My head hurts."
"O: So i have to take the hype of this beer out of the equation and just try to evaluate it for what it is and how it compares to others i've had. The one thing I would say is that the scent leaves something to be desired, only in comparison to IPAs such as Green Flash and Ruination, which just explode. I'm not saying this beer lacks a quality scent, I have to say that it is not the best. Flavor as well is greatly balanced, but lacks that bite or punch. Might be my personal palate, but this isn't thebest IPA i've ever had, however, it was damn good and I would buy again if i had the chance."
"Overhyped on the hoppiness in my opinion. Underhyped on the balance and drinkability. Its like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale's big brother. The majority of hops being aroma. Nice bitter finish, but amazing balance."
"I LOVE IT; WORLD CLASS!"
"This beer lives up to all the hype. It is wonderful! It has very nice deep orange color and a good 1/2 inch head. The smell alone makes this beer fabulous with an explosion of grapefruit, orange and floral scents. The taste is a hop heads dream --- heavy hops, smooth full-bodied taste and a wonderful bitterness at the end."
"O: This is the holy grail of beer. It manages to exceed its lofty reputation. If I could drink one beer the rest of my life, this would be it."
"o - the holy grail of ipa's? well, not to my tastebuds. still a damn fine example of the style. glad i finally got the chance to try it, even though i had to drive across the country to get it. oh, and the 8% does catch up to you by the end of the bottle."
"O: great DIPA, a classic for the style. I've had it now on tap and in bottles many times and will always come back."
"This is a terrific beer. There's not much more to say about it, it's as good as the hype and it stands up to repeated drinkings. As much Pliny as I've had (and I've had a lot) I never get tired of it. I often make the mistake of ordering something else and when I do I often regret the decision. I can't say I've ever regretted a Pliny though."
"Narrative: You shake from your dream in a moist pallor. It seemed so real at the time. You look left and right and see relics of lost friends strewn left and right. /get yearbook. You feel compelled to revisit the past anew. /view photo albums. You feel almost compelled by a higher force to keep returning to these fading memories of grapefruit orchards. /Stop nostalgia. Try as you might you cannot forget the times spent dri- /seriously stop, do something else. You elect to rummage through old shoe boxes that waft of herbal succor. /C:close program.exe"
"Verdict: This is holy grail of IPAs. It’s bone dry, immensely flavorful and beautifully balanced. This beer is a must for any hop head and anyone who appreciates the craft in craft beer."
"Overall - It's fantastic, but you already knew that. I had this beer shipped across the country (trade for a DFH 120) and I don't regret it."
"Overall is IPA that sets the standards for all other IPAs. the flavors are the same you'll find in every other IPA. the execution and balance of the flavors are what make Pliny the Elder the greatest IPA there is. So glad I finally got to try this."
"O-An excellent DIPA. All hype aside, this is a top tier brew that everyone should try. Very smooth and balanced. It has a nice variety of hop flavors. This is not the best beer ever (not even the best DIPA I have had) but does that matter? I would be stocking this often if I had regular access to it. Hope to try it on tap one day."
"O — This is a world class beer, I continue to buy this whenever I can get it"
"Courtesy mashmaster. AWESOME! This stuff really is fantastic. Awesome orange pour with a big fluffy off-white head that laces for days. Amazing balance, wonderful hops flavor and aroma. This is a stellar beer. Plenty of citrus, floral, pine and more. Not overwhelmingly hoppy or malty - wonderfully balanced and delicious."
"UPDATE (1/6/2014): If my life could be told through a beer, this would be the one to do it for me. I have so many fond memories with Pliny - more than I could ever give myself credit for. Romance, inspiration, and celebration have crossed paths with me and this beer. It's a beer I'll hold personally close to me for a good long while, and I'm privileged that I still have full accessibility to it so far. No beer is perfect... But in terms of maintaining a strong, pungent flavor, crisp feel, and a wholly diverse flavor profile for pairing with just about any food... Pliny wins. In my life. Forever and always."
"What's to say that hasn't been said before. A fantastic DIPA that excels across the board. Nice color, plenty of sticky pine resin hops with just enough malt to carry it. Medium body with a nice dry finish that makes a higher alcohol beer like this extremely drinkable."
"Extremely drinkable IIPA thats pretty darn elusive. Wonderful little bugger though."
"I hope one day this is available more extensively but its lack of availability doesn't take away from the experience of getting a pitcher in Santa Rosa."
"For those who've tasted this. You know that no review is really needed. It's just a freak in a bottle. It's a force of nature that everyone should or rather needs to experience. It's hard to rival this king, and some come close. But all in all, This is just a treat for me to obtain and share with close friends."
"I must say, I was let down, I thought for a Double IPA Pliny was very weak. I actually blind taste tested this against 3 other DIPA's and had 2 other people try them and they chose Pliny as the least tasteful each time. I thought it was quite boring actually. I mean it was a good drinkable DIPA, but doesn't pack much punch, lacks on the alchohol, and lacks on the hops...maybe thats why it is so popular, is a more of an """appealing to the masses""" style, rather than a good 13% or so DIPA like many others I've tried that will knock your socks off. I tried 7 RR beers, including Pliny the Younger and have to say I don't see where all the hype is AT ALL."
"O: This is a quality, dry IPA... a little too dry for my tastes. 4"
"O - A good DIPA and would love to have more. Next time I'm asking for a good fresh one however."
"Poured from a 16 oz bottle into a pint glass. Freshness date is 7/11/11, which puts it at a whopping 9 days old. It's strange, I used to live in northern California about 40 minutes from the brewery and I don't know if I ever got one in a bottle this fresh and now I am in San Diego. Go figure. Pours an ever so hazy orange-yellow. Frothy white head that leaves a little lacing and a thin foam on the top. The aroma virtually defines the word """hops""" citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine. A bit of malty sweetness and finally on the end I get another aroma that my friend used to describe as a """funky aged cheese""" aroma. I thought he was a little crazy for a while, but I think I finally get what he was talking about. I also get a bit of the bubblegum backbone that people are talking about and I guess I would associate that with the malt sweetness I mentioned earlier. Medium bodied on the palate, with a nice bit of carbonation. One of the things I like about this beer is that it is not a thick sticky-sweet DIPA. It actually finishes fairly dry. That brings me to what might be my favorite and most impressive thing about Pliny. The balance. I think that in here at Beer Advocate and in the beer world in general, balance is under-appreciated. People get a taste for hoppy beers and they seek out more and more extreme examples of them. The beauty of this beer is that it has incredible complexity both in hops and malt, but one never totally dominates the other. In my opinion that is much more difficult to do than make an over the top hop bomb. Thats why for me, even though this beer gets an incredible amount of hype and attention, I still believe it is deserving."
"outstanding, I have had this beer in all forms, bottle old and new, and growler. All amazing. The older bottles you can mos def can discern from the new ones. My favorite is right at 2 weeks of age. Everything of this beer screams hops, from the color to the taste and ultimately to the color. If your a hophead, you cant carry your badge until you try this beer."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one! Served from growler into a Mikkeller flute. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, pine hop, and citrus hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is always a good brew. However, Pliny was much better out of the bottle. The growler that we drank was QUITE fresh, but it just seemed to lose a little bit of the edge that it has from a fresh bottle. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance and I would LOVE to try it on-tap or even on cask to compare the other serving types in the future."
"O- Outstanding, now I know I didn't rate it as a perfect A+, but..well, it's that hype this at work. I think because of the hype, I almost didn't want to like it, but, it was amazingly good. Light bodied, huge tropical fruit, citrus AND pine presence, just a very slight sweetness from the malt, gorgeously light golden color for a DIPA. Well balanced, easy drinking, leaves you begging for more."
"O- I really liked this beer, but I think the hype and expectations made drinking this a little disappointing. I'm glad I got the chance to try it, but I can honestly say that I will NEVER actively seek this out again unless I can have the beer in my glass within 10 days of being bottled! Hmmm- maybe now I'll go start 19 threads of """Beer X is better than Pliny!!!!1!!""""
"Pours a nice yellow with a soft head, good retention. Nose is floral and fruity. Taste is floral, fruity, hoppy; great for a DIPA. This beer is crisp, refreshing, and dangerously drinkable. It took a long time and nationwide trip, but I finally got my hands on Pliny The Elder and was not disappointed."
"O: An exceptional beer in every respect. Perhaps the quintessential brew of the American beer revolution."
"Overall, I can see why this has been in the top for a long time, but I'm not sure about a beer that can't travel being so hyped. I understand what Vinnie means about not letting it get past two weeks."
"O - Overall, this Double IPA reigns supreme, and for good reason. A great example of a well-balanced DIPA, plenty of hop character but offset by the malts."
"O- Overall, I hate to say it, but I’m disappointed. This bottle is only 5 days old but tastes much older. I don’t know if it was the cross-country trip or some other issue but this isn’t what I expected. I’ve had many better DIPA’s that are a lot easier to come by in my area. I would definitely drink this again but wouldn’t go out of my way to obtain it."
"Beer pours an orangish color with some yellow and a big white head. Left a lot of great lacing on the sides. Smells of super pine hops and just a little bit of malt. Lots of citrus and other things going on, smells great. The taste isn't any type of let down, with great pine hops and things that turn bitter on the end. It doesn't have tropical fruit notes that other ones do, more of a piney grapefruit beer. Really like this one, fantastic on tap."
"Overall, as I said in the beginning, this beer gave me a profound understanding of what exactly it is Vinnie is up to at Russian River. His beers are subtle in the way any man who is sure of his abilities can be subtle. In confidence, a well crafted beer can be flavorful, strong and smooth all at the same time. It is only when one of these qualities is out of balance that the need to call attention to itself arises. All of the Russian River beers I have had so far have shown this. Pliny better than the rest!"
"This beer is good. I don't understand why people freak out with A+ ratings. For me, Ninkasi's """Maiden the Shade""" is a better choice for a similar beer. I don't get why the """bros""" give """Total Domination""" a C rating and then give this an A+? Guess my palette just isn't as refined!"
"O: after being disappointed by Supplication, this beer was a welcome change. Again it is fairly overhyped by BA, but the difference is that this one at least comes close to matching the hype. A very good beer, worth picking up to experience, would be even better had I not known of it's legendary status."
"Overall, I would not pay $5 a pint for a beer I had a bad experience with ever again, but if a friend buys me one, I would be open to trying it again in hopes that the batch was on point."
"Lighter bodied for a DIPA which is perfect for me. The hops really shine through on this and before I knew it I had drained the whole pint with little effort. I just wish I had a way of getting this close to home."
"The flavor balances nicely between the moderately sweet caramel maltiness and the bitterness of the hops; pine, floral, and resiny. I don’t get much in the way of alcohol, probably because the aroma and flavor are too distracting. This is an excellent beer. Medium-full bodied and super easy to drink. I can’t wait to try this on tap someday."
"I would consider this an approachable double IPA. It's not the best, that spot being taken by Bell's HopSlam."
"Drinkability takes a few hits due to the higher alc and thicker Mouthfeel. Not overly sweet which is something I hate in this stye."
"There's no accounting for taste. A well made, pleasant beer but I'm certainly still wearing my socks."
"O-Their is alot of hype behind this beer...it deserves every last second of it...The most well balance DIPA i have ever had...Just perfect on the flavors and finish...For being 8% and so high on the ibu's its so very refreshing...Not to expensive...Would always have this stocked in my fridge and being in SO-CAL i can lol..."
"O: Incredible brew, IPA's aren't my favorite variety, but I definitely have boughten into the hype and gladly admit this is one of the finest beers ever crafted."
"Rating: 97 out 100"
"First of all, I love Russian River. I've been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time. Well, the time has come. The beer pours a nice golden orange with a decent head that settles into a thin ring. Aromas are beautiful: Sharp acidic citrus fruit, grapefruit namely, with pine undertones. No doubt this is a west-coast IPA. The hops and malts play nicely with each other on my tongue--dry saltine crackers and oranges with dabs of piney herbs. All-in-all it is an extremely balanced IPA, but at 8% ABV, I'm tasting booze way more than I should be. Unlike some IPAs, I did not regret reaching the end of the glass. Certainly worth seeking out at convenience-store prices, but please don't go mortgaging your home for BA's number 3!"
"O: When I first had Pliny the Elder I actually said I didn't like it (on tap at the brewery). This was no commentary on the quality though, but rather that I had just gotten into craft beer, saw that at the time it was number one on the top 100 of BA, and had such ridiculous expectations that it was only possible for it to disappoint me. Since that time I've had a lot of beers, I've had a lot of IPAs/DIPAs, and returning to it now I can say that this beer is truly fantastic. If you haven't had it, don't panic and trade an arm and a leg for it because it's not going to destroy your world but definitely get it because it will deliver you a top notch, as-good-as-it-gets DIPA experience."
"O: This was one of those beers being from Michigan that has a huge """rare""" reputation. This one did not disappoint. Smooth, hoppy, lots of citrus and tropical fruits. 8% ABV is very well hidden although is easily detected as it warms still very drinkable. Outstanding!"
"There is nothing better than having a Pliny on the patio of RR on a beautiful Santa Rosa day. Phenomenal beer."
"This is one of my favorite beers. I recently had an opportunity to try it on tap at the Russian River Brewery in downtown Santa Rosa and it didn't disappoint. IPA's tend to be my favorite type and this is a fantastic example of a strong American style double IPA. It has a hoppy, citrusy aroma with a bright clean taste that is perfect for sipping on a hot summer day. This is a beer that I could drink everyday."
"O- No real flaws to point out, very satisfying and easy to drink. Well balanced, bitter, piney, grapefruit, hoppy, deliciousness that you want in a west coast DIPA."
"The Rest: A long, lingering bitter finsh that just boarders on harsh and a nice medium body. A total hop bomb that smacks you in the face without any hint of booziness. Very tasty!"
"Nothing is overstated or overdone; this is a truly elegant, refined beer. It defines the style. Try as I might, I can't find a flaw with it."
"his is my third dance with Pliny and I’m still lovin this stuff. Bottle 7/14/10, so it’s less than three weeks old. That being said, this beer needs to enjoyed in the Bay Area, or better yet at RR. The color is a clear golden yellow with a nice frothy white head. The citrus and hops waft through the air and engage the senses. The taste is fantastic, big piney, citrusy, hops explode on the palate with just enough of a malt backbone to keep scoliosis from setting in. Great balance, huge hoppy characteristics, this is the mold for west coast DIPAs..."
"O: I've had this beer time and time again when at FR and it never fails to amaze me - even if it's the last brew of the evening! It is just a really awesome beer. I'll continue to drink it fresh...and often!"
"A Hop Bomb but one I enjoyed"
"Overall: EXTREMELY drinkable IIPA. Believe what they say! Unmistakably an IIPA, but it has a balance that most beers in the style don't. It's crisp and dry w/o being drying, and has just enough malty sweetness w/o being cloying and syrupy. Highly recommended!"
"O- Overall this was a nice beer. Nice hops but alittle dry at times. Really like this beer and would drink it all the time if i lived in CA but it really didn't live up to the hype for me. It was good but i feel alot of other dipa's r better. Ill keep trying this every few months just to see if it ever lives up to the hype"
"PS> I am glad to see that the first time having it out of a bottle did not disappoint. Anyone who has this fresh is getting the real-deal. Points for consistency."
"O: I know that this beer is hyped to the moon and back, but it really does deserve the praise. This is easily the most well-balanced Imperial IPA I have ever had. I should note that I prefer it on tap as opposed to the bottle, but I'd never turn one down."
"This beer is about as good as it gets. Comparing it to any other top rated beers is like splitting hairs. Instead of trying to compare it to my other favorite beers, I can simply say that this is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Overall: Quite an impressive IPA. Bitter yet smooth and refreshing. Probably one of my top three (along with Victory Hop Wallop and Southern Tier Unearthly)."
"Drinking another bottle, less than a month old. This is a masterpiece. I love Heady Topper, but the drinkability of PtE secures it into the number two slot. Dilemma resolved."
"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast. Russian River if you are reading this, please distribute to the East Coast."
"Really nice, but I'm a bit disappointed about the limited quantities. I guess this beer would lose some of it's luster if i could pick one up whenever i liked, so preserving it for an occasion is something special. A great brew, even if the limited availability has an effect on the scores."
"O- Never disappoints, but I gotta say blind pig is my go to beer"
"A very tasty and easy to drink DIPA. Although the grapefruit hops are dominant, the biscuit malt also has a solid presence bringing balance and depth of flavor."
"Very nice IPA, flavorful without being over the top. Complex and a bit understated at the same time."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a big foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of lacing. There is a steady stream of carbonation throughout the life of the beer. The aroma fills the room with floral, piney hops as soon as the cap is popped on this gem. The aroma really opens up as the beer is being poured and starts to showcase some citrusy notes as well. No real malt aromas to speak of The flavor is bursting with piney, floral hops. Not nearly as much citrus in the flavor as in the nose. Surprisingly there is really not much in the way of alcohol presence, hard to believe this is a 8% beer. Medium bodied and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation and a dry finish. Really quite good, and I can see why it is rated world class."
"Overall, As the nose and mouth on this blew me away the taste really fell short for the category. Not that I didn't enjoy this, but I could name at least five DIPA's or IPA's that blow this away on taste. Thanks to aandresen for the extra."
"O- You don't need me to tell you this, go get this beer any way you can. Drink it, it's good."
"Finally had my first pliny the elder last week, scored a couple of bottles from beverages4lessinc.com amongst many other things. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. It is a great DIPA, the piney and citrus hop notes were amazing, the taste and mouthfeel as it goes down lingers in a good way on your pallette. But i was expecting to be blown out of the water by this beer, everyone saying its the best ever of the style. I will give it #2 of the style, i prefer dogfish head 90 min to pliny, there i said it!"
"O - My notes taken at the time simply say """Sweet Jebus that's good""". Really, this beer does live up to the hype around it. It looks great, it's aroma is transportative, and the combination of complexity with smoothness and drink-ability is incredible."
"The reason I love beer, condensed into sixteen ounces. It doesn’t get any better than this."
"cheers!"
"This beer gets a lot of (sometimes negative) hype about being a hop bomb. I find it to be a delicately balanced, hop forward masterpiece."
"Thanks again Brian!"
"Overall, I found the beer quite uninteresting. I'd be willing to try it again from tap, but not in a bottle. Maybe it loses its qualities in travel, but it could not have been very old, considering the extremely short length of time it's available in store coolers. I suspect that the hype for this beer has been manufactured by limiting the supply, as I can think of at least a half dozen DIPAs that I would prefer. All I can say is try it yourself (if you can), but don't throw away your palate just because it's been so well reviewed."
"I feel this beer holds up to the hype. Reminds me of a filtered boyking from coast brewing."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, I agree that this is a near perfect DIPA.  It's so incredibly balanced, yet the flavor intensifies as it warms and continues to coat the palate."
"O- Back when this first came out, it was the original and its creator is credited with the style. However, I feel other breweries have raised the bar. It is a rather dry DIPA which you dont see too often and I like that. A great DIPA, but didnt live up to the hype for me."
"Fantastic, overwhelming hop aroma!! It seems as though they have squeezed every bit of aromatics from the hops. Beautiful copper/amber color with a lasting white head. Good body, not too chewy. Malty sweetness is overwhelmed by bitter and citrusy hops. The aroma stays through the end. It leaves your empty glass smelling like hops. PHENOMINAL."
"I have to admit, I was about to get a Hanger 24 beer as I was in Redlands, but after seeing dozens of people order Pliny, I was motivated to give it a try. I'm glad I did. This is one of the smoothest IPA's I've had. As others reviews note, this beer has great citrusy notes and avoids the excessive bite of some IPA's. This should be a must try if you can find it!"
"O - Worth any and all hype it gets, this is an incredibly smooth and balanced IPA. A true classic."
"Overall this beer somehow was able to live up to all of my expectations for it. We had planned to go to the west coast for our honeymoon, with this beer being the clincher for east V. west coast, but when job interviews instead cut it short to Colorado, finding this was somewhat of a religious experience. The 8.0 abv is smoothly disguised and it is a beer worth all of the accolades."
"On tap it's damn fine and wonderful. There's no doubt as to why it's one of the top beers ever."
"Bottled on 6/3/11. Pours slightly hazy with a nice foam that lingers throughout. This beer has smells of pine, dank, floral hops mixed with a slight spicy note. The aromas are very similar to the taste, where the alcohol is quite nicely hidden amongst the hops and malt. Speaking of the malt, it is there in such a great way that this beer seems balanced. Even with the huge amount of hops, this beer has drinkability. Very nice beer, I love picking up a bottle whenever I see it available and this fresh."
"The most highly inticipated beer ever for me. I had a coworker get this in Cali for me, thx Joyce! Poured into 13 oz tulip glass. Very bright yellow / orange with a sticky white head. Grapefruit, pine, pineapple, & some grass. Taste with all of those flavors together, a little more powerful then the nose, with a blast of piney grapefruit in the finish. Mouth feel is perfect for a DIPA. Nice carbonation. This was what the hype is all about, the best in this style I have had. Double Trouble close second. Bottle date 5/26/11."
"O- One of the best IPAs around, has great hop character and balance, I never get tired of this beer."
"Overall, absolutely delicious brew. Stellar DIPA! Tropical, hoppy, light, sweet, mildly bitter. What more can you ask for from an IPA?"
"O- Awesome double IPA. I feel this beer has gotten a little too hyped but this is seriously one of the most smooth and well balanced IPA's you can get and everyone should try it."
"O - Blessed be. The almighty Pliny has spoken and he deserves the hype."
"4.5 D: Great beer that is better on-tap."
"O - An incredible DIPA. It takes the beautiful citrus hop flavors well known in west coast IPAs and creates a complex, balanced, and complete IIPA worthy of its ranking. From first hit of the lips to moments after you swallow, this beer does not disappoint."
"there are many beers on beeradvocate and ratebeer that end up with an A+ out of superhype and super limited availability. this isn't one. not only is it not super limited in washington, but the superhype is justified. it is absolutely the perfect double IPA. it doesn't even stand out - there's not really anything i can say jumps out at you - it's just what every double IPA aspires to be."
"O: If you don't like super fresh Pliny, then you might want to start drinking something other than beer. Be sure to check the dates, as this beer fades considerably at around the month old mark. But for those most part, the beer sells out quickly enough that freshness won't be a problem. Happy drinking!"
"O: Maybe not as fresh as it should be(5/4). Not as dynamic has I remember while drinking draft pliney. Still really good, next time I'll find a fresher one."
"O: I had figured that this beer was way over hyped (probably like a lot of us did). This beer blew me away. I was expecting some huge bitter hop explosion. But the beer focuses on the hop flavors and doesn't destroy your palette. You get all the distinct aromas and flavors out of this beer. They make sure you don't miss a thing."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer and can now understand the hype. would love to have this again while sitting on the patio on a hot summer day."
"Overall, this is one that lives up to the hype. Pliny achieves balance throughout and it's incredibely drinkable. Soooo damn tasty."
"Bottled 5/24/11"
"O: Very nicely balanced DIPA. Nice caramel sweetness and bitter citrus with hints of tropical fruits. This is very delicious but I expected more from it. Doesn't live up to the hype IMO."
"To those of you not lucky enough to live where you can readily get a Pliny, I will say this: whatever trouble you need to go through to try it, it will be worth it."
"I love IPA's, and this is the best of the bunch!"
"I can see why this is the Imperial IPA that many a beer aficionado thinks of when discussing world class offerings in this style. Golden orange in color, Pliny The Elder has big notes of grapefruit up front, highlighting the array of citrusy hops. The hoppiness is complimented by roasted malt and caramel with a crisp, clean finish. It never fails to amaze me how this ale can have such a sizable hoppy presence, yet be so surprisingly smooth to drink."
"O: I wouldn't say that it exceeded my expectations since it's top 5 on the planet according to BA. Very nice all around Imperial but not for those that are looking to get knocked out by hops!"
"Color me impressed; definitely not my favorite DIPA, but for the price and """rare factor""" it is good. I went into it thinking it would be disappointing, and it wasn't entirely. Still, not the over the top amazing beer I was expecting, but great nonetheless."
"Pours a golden orange with a fluffy white head that laces well. Great floral aroma, rich with piney hops and citrus. The taste starts out biscuity and crisp with sweet, pale malts. The hop bitterness comes in quickly and takes over, overlaid with flavors of lemon zest, pine, grapefruit, meadow grass and flowers. Medium mouthfeel, finishes crisp and dry. Highly drinkable, and highly recommended if you can find it."
"Overall, a really well balanced IPA. I could sit and drink this all day long."
"O - maybe due to all the hype around this beer I was expecting a bunch more, and while I think it does a greta job of being balanced, maybe even perfectly so, for me there's a few others I would prefer to drink, evne if they are not as balanced or smooth. I know it's against the grain, but that's my opinion on it. Solid, would get it if I'm someplace that has it, but won't go out of way to trade for it again."
"Nothing but good things to say about this one. Great color, amazingly light, crisp feel. A lot of balance to the herbal/citrus hops, more of an exotic (yuzu?) tang to them than the more familiar pine/grapefruit notes. Nice maltiness that doesn't at all get in the way of the finish. Just a beautiful beer overall."
"Overall: Not quite sure why this beer is rated so highly to be honest. If you have never had this beer before try it and then make sure and give it an A+ rating that it does not deserve"
"Overall- Wow what an amazing DIPA, although it does remind me of other east coast DIPA’s that I have tried before, I do understand why it has such a big hype, this beer is simply outstanding. I wish I had regular access to this one as my fridge would probably be full of it. Great aromas right away once the bottle is opened to the great balanced tastes throughout. ISO: More pliny."
"O. A fantastic beer without a shadow of a doubt. I doubt I could say anything about it that hasn't been said a hundred times already."
"My favorite beer for my first review. Pours a beautiful amber with a couple fingers of white head. The smell is delicious, pine and citrus, but not quite as strong as I'd want for a 5. Taste is sublime, this beer is perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing."
"O- An absolute wonder of a beer. Has to be in the top 2 of DIPAs that I've had, second only to Pliny the Younger. This is so amazing I'd like to bathe in it, then drink it!"
"O-A good beer indeed, but I don't know about it being #3 on BA. My bottle was about 4-5 weeks old, some might say I need to have it fresher, but what top ranked IPA/DIPA isn't fantastic when super fresh."
"Week old bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a light honey color with some head and minimal lacing. Smells of pine, floral notes, and not even a hint of alcohol. Very well masked for 8 percent. Taste is quite smooth...very piney with just a touch of citrus and floral components. Mouthfeel is top of the line. No abrasive bitterness, so clean. Great beers, world class."
"Overall, this is the standard bearer for the style. It is just about perfect. All other are judged against this."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. If you're a fan of hoppy beers, than this is a beer you must try. If you're not really into bitter beers, but are willing to give one a shot, then I highly recommend this one. This beer has a bite, but the tangerine flavor and smell will help you get through you glass with no problem at all..."
"O: Overall a very impressive beer. It does everything well. Honestly for as much hype as this beer gets I thought it would be better (like KBS or Westy 12 type """wow""" factor). It's quite good but not out of this world. This isn't a strike against it, it's easily top 3 DIPA for me. I think this is better than Maharaja (Maharaja being a bit too big and malty and overpowering in general) but a little worse than Hopslam (which blew my socks off). Different strokes for different folks though, and this is clearly an excellent beer. I have rated it as such."
"D - If I was stranded on a deserted island...well, you get the picture. Overall, I can't say enough positive things about this beer. Once again, my outlook on craft beer has been jolted. Big shout out to Azurescens who got this for me as fresh as I will ever have it living in MI."
"O: Amazing. Obvious why this is rated so ridiculously highly, even though this bottle is 3 months old and has been shipped to Australia. Does taste malt-heavy but is still very enjoyable. 4.5"
" O: I enjoyed this quite a bit. It's a shame here in Ct. , it's quite hard to find. I'll savor the memory for a while."
"The bottle reviewed was 2 weeks old."
"M – Medium body with a soft mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Lingering herbal bitterness."
"O- I waited along time to get my hands on one of these and it was worth it. The bottles that I got were about 2 weeks old when I tried them."
"O - An outstanding and enjoyable beer. Wish I lived in Cali so I could grab this anytime!"
"O- This brew makes your senses go to work. From the Grade A cannabis smell to the 3 layers of flavor. This is a complex beer and definitely a brew you wanna drink on the warmer upcoming months."
"This was the perfect double I.P.A., no question about it. The beer pours a hazy golden color with not much head. I found it to have more carbonation that some of the other double I.P.A.'s I've had. Pliny gives off an incredible aroma of pine with barely a hint of fruit. It was a little too cold for our first few tastes so the hop explosion was very intense, but as the beer dropped in temperature you could taste every element to this beer perfectly. An initial hop explosion that leaves a citrus, grapefruit, taste lingering behind with absolutely no undesirable aftertaste. The only thing that I can find wrong with this beer is that it is incredibly difficult to find. Places were sold out of it or had limited quantities. If you are ever on the west coast, this beer is a must!"
"This is a great beer. The start is like a pine flavored hop cone that is followed by a subtle grain flavor. The finish is slightly bitter, but does not linger long at all. I think it is that perfect amount of time."
"not sure i could really think of this as an a a+ but its a pretty damn good ipa and a nice name."
"*Edit: Jan 2012* Had this straight from the teet when I was in San Francisco recently. While I still think this is a fantastic DIPA, I've tried so many since my first review that I believe I can give a more objective score at this moment in time. I'm also fairly confident that this re-visiting will continue into further reviews as I try more beers."
"O-great beer. i'm not normally a fan of hoppy beers but this is so well made that you can't help but enjoy it."
"Overall, this is a fine, fine beer. I don't think it blows everything else out of the water, but it's quite clearly in the top tier of beers of this style."
"Bright amber yellow in color with slight haze. Poured with a fluffy white head with excellent staying power that ultimately reduced to a pillowy white cap. Nice sticky lacings on the glass. Very smooth with a slightly resinous feel toward the finish. Big tropical/citrus aroma, grapefruit and orange the most prominent, with a hint of pineaapple. After your nose gets accustomed to the hope aroma intensity, the sweet malt aromas begin to show through. Burst of citrus hops on the palate with a delicate malty feel underneath. Finishes with a touch of piney hop bitterness. Although this a showcase of hop aroma and flavor the flavors and feel are smooth creamy and delicate. Excellent!"
"Overall: Good beer. I kept putting off picking up this beer due to the fact I'm no one's hop head, but I can see myself enjoying this one on a hot summer day."
"O: D-licious)"
"Perfect body for an Imperial IPA. Moderate carbonation. Manages to be crisp and juicy, yet retain dextrinous body. Not too sweet or heavy like some can be."
"O - Perfect example of a DIPA. So much drinkability and so smooth. One of the best beers of the style."
"I suppose I expected my life to change after having this. I guess that was a but lofty to expect, but still this is wonderful...amazing beer! I still rank fresh dreadnaught a hair above this, and I think hopslam’s sweeter heavier nature has traits that far surpass this, but this is simply amazing beer. I think this is one of the few examples of a beer that attempts to match stone’s dominance of IPAs without over charging or under producing."
"Love this beer, and am VERY fortunate to have it on a regular basis. Just one more reason to love California"
"Why talk about the mouthfeel? It's just as it needs to be for an IPA. It finishes very clean but still allows the bitterness of the hops to linger a bit. It's excellent. And that goes for the overall. Many think this beer might be overhyped...I am not one of them. This beer deserves its accolades as it hits all the right notes."
"O: A+, I like its balance more than anything; this beer has pine-y, juicy, resin-y characteristics but they don't overwhelm you. It's actually a touch lighter than most 'big' double IPA's but it seems pretty approachable and more sessionable."
"Mouthfeel: bubbly and light"
"Overall - This beer lives up to the hype and has surpassed it."
"O) A classic what more can I say."
"o-I am really impressed. This beer needs to be consumed within a few weeks to really get the Pliny experience. I think this stuff would be amazing days after bottling. Great DIPA."
"overall: This is a very good beer. It actually smells much better than it taste (and it tastes very good). The fusion between grapefruit and pine works very well and its something unique that I have yet to taste in other double IPA's. I would highly recommended this beer, and I wish Russian River could distribute closer to me so I could drink it more often."
"A very tasty DIPA, but the hops just aren't there in the taste as much as I'd like them to be. I've heard tell that this beer fades fast after bottling, and I recognize that this bottle may have suffered from that. But 6 weeks ain't that old, and this, while good, doesn't blow my socks off."
"O - get you some, buy it fresh if possible. It's worthy of its reputation."
"O - I enjoy this at least twice as much as I have week-old bottles. I am not sure if it is a freshness thing; three days difference seems to miniscule to produce that much change, but I may be wrong about that. I am more inclined to think that it is better on-tap than in bottles."
"Pours a clear burnt orange, a rocky white head clings with lace, smells of citrus, pineapple, pine, caramel malt and subtle alcohol. Hop complexity dominates the flavor, moves around with different intensities of bitterness, excellent balance. Light bodied and lively but a little chewy on the end. Overall it's a perfect example of the west coast style. I finally got around to reviewing it. One of the best"
"O- I was very excited to try this beer and it lived up to the hype for me. I really expected this beer to blow me away by having some flavor notes that really stood out like being very hoppy or very sweet, overly piney or overly citrusy, but what was so great is that there was such great balance and I did not expect that. Overall a fantastic DIPA and a must try."
"Overall. Awesome dipa. Smooth and easy drinking. I can see why so many people love this stuff."
"So good. Lived up to the hype for me. Will be trading for more."
"O Very fortunate to have RR in my area. This is what a DIPA is all about. So far, there is no other beer like it. But I still have a lot to try."
"O.) - Finally got to try the celebrated Pliny the Elder after getting a hold of a bottle at last. As I said, a dangerously drinkable brew that will leave you warm and feeling pleasant after one bottle. Everything is perfectly balanced here. Less hoppy than imagined, given its reputation. A pleasant surprise. I expected Pliny to be an overrated, overly hoppy beer that would inevitably let me down given the hype but I was wrong. Quite sore it's not available in Wisconsin. I paid $20 for the bottle. Is Pliny a $20 bottle of beer? Probably not, especially considering it's a year-rounder, but worth it for the one time experience if it's not in your area. I don't know when I'll be able to have my next one, but I look forward to it."
"Overall, PtE is well deserving of all its hype. Extremely well balanced and luckily its readily available in my area."
"Drinkable for the style, with a lot of ABV to be sessionable. I hear a lot of talk about these beers, glad I tried this one."
"D - Very drinkable, even at 8%. I'm not sure what's left to say after over 2,000 reviews that hasn't already been said. This is an all around wonderful beer that I strongly wish was available to me locally."
"O/D - I'm hooked. This beer is great drinking experience; the outstanding appearance and intense aroma set up the balanced flavor profile and excellent mouth-feel exceedingly well. It's a good thing I have a few more of these because this one sure went down easy. Can't wait for the next one."
"Obviously this beer's reputation precedes it, and for good reason. PtE has great taste, a balanced complexion, and it nails the West Coast style as well as or better than any other DIPA. Awesome brew. Wish it was a little easier to get our hands on, but being in Philly I guess I can't complain!"
"Clear honey golden base (maybe a touch of hop haze) with 2 fingers of bubbly, slightly off white head. Initial smell is all tropical fruit – fresh pineapple, sweet orange, and mango. Pine needles and an elegant astringency from the hops follow the initial tropical fruit attack. Taste echoes the smell with the initial attack really showing off those tropical, sweet fruits. The fruit is followed by a nice transition to bittering hops. This is virtually the only IPA/IIPA that I’ve had the pleasure of tasting that has such a fantastic transition from the start to the mid-palate to the finish. Overall, bar none, the best IPA I’ve had the pleasure of enjoying. If/when I am on the west coast and this is available in bottle or on tap, it will be sought after…. By any means necessary."
"O ~ Well worth seeking out!! Via trade, road trip, whatever..."
"O - This is a fantastic beer overall and it is one of the best DIPAs that I have ever had. I am pretty sure that if I had this within a few days of bottling, it would be my favorite, but it is amazing nonetheless. The alcohol is completely hidden my the hop bitterness and the citrusy character. Thanks again ccm414 for this extremely rare opportunity!"
"Overall: I've always counted Pliny as one of the best beers I've been privaledged to try. Getting some straight from the teet only reaffirmed that. The only other IPA that comes close in my book is Bling Pig."
"All DIPA's should aspire to be this awesome. Even some of the best DIPA's are too heavy on the malty side or bitter side. This is perfect. IMHO!"
"Incredible beer. Had it a couple times. Always forget just how good it is."
"Overall, I have had this brew many times, which is a privaledge on the east coast. Tremendous DIPA! One of the top three examples of the style in the world, and my current second favorite behind Sculpin(in all fairness Sculpin is an IPA)."
"Overall: This beer is excellent and highly drinkable.I am always grateful that I can get fresh batch of PtE any day any time. This beer is a staple in my fridge together with Sculpin. Also, it's a great extra. Thanks Russian River for such a wonderful beer."
"O: I've always viewed Sculpin as the pinnacle in this category. Is Pliny as good? I'm not sure about that, but I plan on doing a blind tasting soon to put them to the test!"
"Overall a great representation of the style, some could say industry standard. Its not my favorite beer out there but it was a great experience none the less"
"O = Well the legacy this beer possesses is pretty incredible. Does it live up to the hype?? I venture to say, Most Certainly. It's a fantastic DIPA and probably the best of that style I've enjoyed. It's well balanced, not crazy with the ABV and is very drinkable. I would love to have this been in regular rotation in my fridge. Unfortunately, the distance and cost of shipping it will make it a once or twice a year treat."
"O: Solid, solid DIPA, but I guess I was a little let down given the hype. While I wouldn't turn it down if offered, I won't seek out again."
"O: Overall a great brew to say the last. Im not that much of an IPA fan overall, but have liked beers like Nelson, Pliny, and Citra. Pliny is probably my favorite IPA from a bottle."
"Overall - There's a reason why Pliny is the standard Imperial IPA. It does everything right. It may not be the most innovative beer out there, but it doesn't need to be, much like Sculpin is to single IPAs. I find it hard to find faults here. It doesn't have some of the cool hop flavors that I like in other beers (like the tropical fruit flavors in Nugget Nectar), but it's the most well balanced imperial IPA I've had."
"O: A very nice beer that lives up to the hype its one of the great beers to try for sure."
"Overall: I have had better IPAs ,but this one was very nice and lighter feel to it. It wasn't good enough to be a staple in my fridge, but definetly has room in there if I can get a hold of some more."
"0- overall this beer is a solid representation of the style, but not the best IIPA ive ever had. I would gladly drink one again if i got a hold of another fresh one but I can think of plenty of IIPAs that are better beers overall."
"O: I found Pliny to be an excellent brew but too overhyped. I find its excellence to be in the incredible balance of Pliny. I will say Pliny is the most balanced DIPA I've had to date and very drinkable. Overall, I would rather have Abrasive Ale."
"Always a favorite when fresh, tasted from bottle about two weeks old. Great lemon peel and grapefruit aromas with a hint of purple basil and herbaceous notes. Body is medium and the alcohol is well hidden. Flavors of grapefruit and Meyer lemon dominate with a touch of the herbal components coming through on the finish. This beer has always been worth the hype to me and it can't be beat for the price, incredibly smooth for a double and impeccable balance makes this a little too easy to drink."
"O: I can't say this lived up to the immense hype, but damn if it isn't a truly great beer. The thing that sticks out most about Russian River's Pliny the Elder is the subtle balancing act, that it doesn't take EXTREME flavors and gimmicks to make a high quality and delicious bottle of beer. A big reccomendation, and a brew worth seeking out as soon as you possibly can."
"Poured into a ccb pint glass. Golden and translucent, two finger head with lots of lacing. Aromas of citrus and pine in the hops with malt in the background. Taste follows the nose, very hoppy, some malt bitterness is high. it doesn't seem as complex as the hype around this beer, it's a great dipa just not as great as all the hype."
"O: What else can I say that has not already been said? This is the definitive example of the West Coast DIPA."
"Overall an excellent beer. I really do see why this is rated so highly. Fantastic beer all around."
"The standout aspect for me is the damn-near alive, pungent and juicy freshness that gives this beer one heck of a presence. It has the """bigness""" often associated with a serious red wine. However it seems to lack a little depth and doesn't quite open out enough on the palate. I'd be very keen to try it on tap or from the source some day and do a re-review."
"O - Part of me was hoping that this beer was all hype and that I could discount it as a hype bomb, the other hoping to enjoy it immensely. The latter won. One of the best DIPA's and really shines when fresh. If you're on the east coast like myself, demand this fresh or decline. It's truly a different animal with as much of a month+ on it."
"This beer is phenomenal. Love that it'snot overly dry. A great kick in the mouth while being balanced at the same time. Thanks to my boy aasher for the hard to get brew"
"I had this beer twice at DLD but this is my first time trying it in a controlled, review worthy setting. The bottle is dated 4/6/11. It pours a beautiful bright gold in color with perfect white lacing around my Founders snifter. The aromas are of sweet resinous pine, pineapple, sharp citrus, and floral hops. It smells amazing. The flavors are soft and sweet. The pine, honey, grapefruit, oranges, and floral notes all mesh perfectly. The mouthfeel is near perfect for an IPA. It is light in body, not overly sticky, and is only slightly dry. Overall this beer is a gem and is a treasure to finally sit down and enjoy. This beer is worthy of all of the accolades and attention. Hats off to Russian River!"
"O: Lives up to the hype. Amazing in all regards. Get yourself a Pliny The Elder as soon as possible."
"Malt isn't much! Alpha acid delight. Great f'ing beer."
"Serving type: Bottle."
"Overall it's everything they say it is. It's the more mature fraternal twin of Dogfish's 120 minute that doesn't need to be loud to make a statement. It's power is in it's complexity."
"ALWAYS my first pick. Has the IPA bite, but isn't that what is all about? yay it is! Color is beautifuly set. Taster is is full of depth but not heav. ABV is average to other ales of this type. It sells out at the local Liquor store that has it sometimes. Local pub always has it on tap or some Russian River Beer, which are all gooed in my opinion!"
"O: this is a solid IIPA, the hoppy citrus flavors complement each other nicely, glad that I was able to try it but don’t think this is really worth all the hype"
"O: A very carefully balanced brew that lives up to the hype. Glad I ran down to the pub to try it."
"Overall- Great DIPA. Dangerously drinkable at 8%. I'm glad that I have been able to try it so many times. I think that I'm pretty happy with my Michigan DIPA's though. I just wish Hopslam and Double Trouble were year-round."
"Brassy golden with a big, creamy ivory colored cap that leaves sheets of crusty lace on the glass. The aroma..yeah, real nice. Fruit juicy and resinous grapefruit rind and sticky pine sap with subtle caramel cube sweetness. The flavor is a perfect combination of some of my favorite hops, Columbus, Simcoe, Chinook and Centennial and the aromatics really bring out the flavor with each sip. The big resinous hop notes are just balanced with malt sweetness. Medium bodied, slightly sticky and smooth with soft carbonation. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had, a beer that truly lives up to the hype."
"Overall, really quite good. I would gladly drink another!"
"Lovely pour resulting in a wonderful three finger head of thick fluff. Lace is full and clings to the bottom of the glass. Color is a 13 on the SRM color chart. Snell is intense, with aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, apple, mint, and malt. Taste is very complex, with flavors of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, apple, lemon, mint, pear, and malt. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, with goodly amount of carbonation to add zing. I really like this beer!!! So refreshing with the great citrus flavor smashing over the top. So refreshing, and a great buzz also. I will get some more."
"O - Excellent DIPA and I'm very glad to have tried it. Not sure it really lives up to all the hype, but it's delicious none the less. Great flavor profile and everything is in balance. Definitely one of the better if not best DIPAs I've ever had."
"mouthfeel: oily as possible. me likey."
"Pours a hazy orange sunset with red tones. Bottled 4/06/11. The head is three fluffy fingers of egg shell white foam that slowly dissipates leaving thick spider web lacing. Nose has rich malts, floral/pine, some lighter citrus notes and almost a little spicy hop bitterness. Taste is alot of bitter piney hops upfront, a touch of earthiness, rich malts that balance nicely with a hoppy finish, not overly sweet. Very drinkable for a dipa but i still like a touch more complexity out of what i am drinking - maybe some tropical fruit or heavier citrus notes. The beer is well balanced but it is simply perfect with just a hop/malt balance and not much else there."
"Overall this is an exceptional beer and I think its worth the hype. My first thought is that its sad that you can't sit on this beer and save it for a special occasion. At the same time getting your hands on this finely made beer is special enough to make an occasion out of it!"
"It's definitely an amazing experience, but with so many amazing West Coast DIPAs out there, it's really not much better than things like fresh Sculpin, Double Jack, and greatly inferior I think to Alpine Duet."
"O- This is the finest example of the style I've ever had. Simple, yet complex in all the right ways, nothing really gets in its way of just knocking your socks off with hop bite and a clean and crisp feel. It does what it does perfectly."
"Cheers!"
"OMFG, let the hate begin. Poured a golden color into that damn shaker glass. Aroma of citrus and pine. Taste was citrus with too much bitterness in the end for my palate. Good but I don't see the """holy crap. I HAVE to try this. My pallete just doesn't sem to get it."
"Thanks D"
" Wolf among scrubs"
"Overall-This beer is so easy to drink. The expectations are SOO high on this beer and the Aroma and Mouthfeel are spot on. I think I was expecting a little more of a slap in the face, but still a great beer. Nonetheless, I would drink this every day."
"O - Tastes and feels very well balanced, looks gorgeous and there's no hint of alcohol. Very easy drinking and not a palate killer. This lives up to the hype. It's an extremely well made beer. Within the style you won't find one better."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- You can't ignore the hype, but this one is tops. Compares nicely to Younger, but the flavor is just enough differnt. If you haven't tried it yet, get one now!"
"Edit: Two more bottles later and drinking other, comparable beers, this really is worth the hype. The oily finish is simply like no other."
"O: this beer definitely walks the walk. The hype is on the money. Amazing to say the least"
" Overall this is one of those beers that lives up to the hype.Everyone should try this beer at least once.One of the best DIPA's I have had to date."
"D- 4.5 I would happily take down this brew with the slightest of restraint... It is very tasty, powerful, and balanced. I think it'd be something that I'd savor for nice occasions. Part of me saying that is due to the fact that I can't just go out and buy it where I am located; maybe it'd be different if I could get it all the time. Either way, I had high expectations because of its hype and it really did live up to it. I was probably more critical of it than I am on average given the circumstances, and it was still tough to find fault. An excellent beer that is deserving of its praise, and I hope to enjoy it again."
"O - Extremely good DIPA. Can definitely see why this is a classic. Tons of hop character, with nothing else getting in the way. Really only suitable for a total hop-head. Way too drinkable for 8%. For someone who loves hops, I really can't imagine this getting much better."
"O- nice IPA. Im more of an unbalanced piney IPA guy but definately apprecite this one."
"o - what can i say, im a lucky guy to be able to get me some pliny on the reg. now if only i could get my hands on a glass of the younger on draft..."
"O) An all around great beer.... still not the """knock it out of the park""" life-altering experience the hype would lend oneself to believe, but a really great beer that I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to taste. I would certainly pick it up frequently if I were in an area that had this fine beer distributed."
"This is a great beer. If it could be believed, I would say this is like Pliny the Younger with slightly muted flavors and a little less balance. A world-class, year-round offering from Russian River."
"Overall an excellent brew. But not up to the hype. I was expecting a more """wow""" factor. Again, a very good beer, but not mindblowing."
"O - The best DIPA that I have tried to date. 4.5"
"O- Yes, and yes. Simcoe makes this beer just wonderful. Drink it fresh - don't get an old bottle on sale, that's bad form for this style of IPA. Yum."
"Overall, it is definitely a favorite of mine and my friend said it lived up my hype. However, the Double Jack I tried last weekend blew me away. This is right there with it a 1 and 1a in my book."
"M/D: Perfect carbonation, not an absolute tongue bruiser, which is nice, very balanced as a dipa goes. I wish I lived on the west coast, I would buy one every time I saw it."
"This is a four week old bottled directly send to my by a friend in the US, thanks. Pours a golden color with a nice fluffy head. Smell: huge American hop aromas dominates the nose, grapefuits, flowers, grass, and a bit of orange. A bit too dry in the mouth, with clean malts, more grapefruit. Very strong bitterness, not very drinkable to me. Still nice to try"
"This beauty has all the citric, strawberry, and piny esters in exquisite balance like the other top echelon DIPAs, but it's the incredibly floral (geranial) quality of the hops that really sets it apart. Absolutely sublime."
"A big thank you goes out to Dempsey16 for this wonderful brew (I suspect he equally enjoyed the Dreadnaught). Bottle to (frosty) pint glass. Delicious :P Hoppy, but wonderfully balanced. Perfectly sketched; drawn from the very palette VanGogh uses for his sunflowers. Beautiful on both ends. One of my top 2 beers (tied with Dreadnaught, although the edge goes to Pliny because I can't get RR with the same regularity that I can 3 Floyds."
"If you have not had this beer before and you are a hop head, do yourself a favor. This is text book how it should be done. Does not put a foot wrong in any respect. Thank you RR, fantastic."
"Overall - This beer is why I don't enjoy other IPAs anymore. I know what an IPA can be and I expect it out of every other one I have. This is the bar."
"Overall, I can see why this is considered by many to be one of the best beers in the world regardless of style. The combination of citrus hop flavor and bitterness with good malt sweetness is exceptional."
"Two weeks later another buddy shares his growler that was filled that morning. Just as tasty with even more nose."
"O- Just an excellent DIPA, really lives up to the hype. PTE one of the best smelling DIPAs out there. A brew everyone needs to try before they die."
"D/O- Great beer overall that has been a great bastian of beer Karma over the years. PTE as far as I'm concerned is second to only one Imperial IPA, they just happen to be related."
"O: This is undeniably a great imperial IPA. Very drinkable for 8 percent, awesome hop presence through and through. Definitely one of the best in its style."
"Hops anyone? This is the first time I have actually saw hops in a beer. As soon as you crack it you can smell the hops. But it's balanced - nice sweet malts and alcohol in harmony with the bitterness and citrus, pine and earthy, hops. Try it, you'll love it."
"Overall, this lived up to the hype for me both here from the bottle and fresh from the tap in Philadelphia. Just an extremely perfectly well done west coast DIPA. Love Russian River's methods and all their products."
"This is one of the best and most balanced DIPA's I've had. The closest comparison would be Flower Power, followed by Sculpin. I think this is a better beer than it's over-hyped Younger brother."
"This is a really solid IPA. It isn't really overpowering in any one flavor category, and certainly tastes delicious in all of them. What you've got here is one solid beverage that I could see myself enjoying regardless of the weather. Still, bonus if a hammock is involved."
"O - This beer is a gift from above. Great hop and malt profile with a heavy citrus, floral hop component that is present yet not too overwhelming."
"O: An amazing beer that I am so glad to finally try. Going to open a second bottle here soon and will try to trade for more in the future!"
"Overall: I love this beer. The perfect DIPA, so far only Surly Abrasive can compete IMO. I have had this beer side by side with others in the DIPA style and none of those hold a candle to this. It deserves the high rating and hype it receives. No disappointment here at all."
"D: everyone knows the name. a solid DIPA and arguably the best example there is. i actually had 2 bottles of this stuff gifted to me and felt this review needed to be revisited."
"Carbonation is perfectly balanced with the hops and citrus to leave a tingle on the tongue to go with the pine, but is flat enough that you really get a feel for the beer and can taste everything without struggling to cut through the bubbles. Drinkability is on another planet due to the balance and finish, and the 8% abv is a complete nonfactor. I could have as many of these in a row as my body would allow, and it would be just as good at the end as at the beginning. At 4 bucks a bottle, there is no better deal on earth than this."
"I'd say the """sippability""" is good, as long as you don't intend to actually taste anything after it. Drank this at the Pizza Port in OB, San Diego, served in a snifter."
"O: A really nice balance of hops, abv and grain. A very harmonious Double IPA."
"Overall: I love this beer. You don't pick up the alcohol at all. The hop profile is amazing, and it has just the right amount of sweetness. I'd take this over the Younger if I had to choose just one of them."
"o - Overall when it comes to DIPAs, this one is the king. The smell is the highlight, but the flavor profile is a close second..gets better as it warms. World class all the way. Very happy to have a fresh growler of this to work on tonight (with the wife)."
"Overall - A beer that lives up to the hype. I actually found it a bit difficult to find the words to describe it. Truly a remarkable, remarkable beer."
"PS: Anyone paying attention to my not-perfect-on-all-counts scores, don't. Just buy it and if you don't like it, ship it to me. I'll make it worth your while."
"O - Wow this beer good! I think it somewhat lived up to all the hype surrounding it, and I'm happy to finally try as I live in CA for beers sake! This DIPA is definitely worth picking up time and time again, and even though it comes in at 8% ABV, it's still very smooth and can be a little dangerous because of how delicious it is. Very drinkable DIPA that actually tastes like an IPA to me. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
"Overall, this beer is doing everything right for me, except for the lingering bitterness. It tends to stick (or be sticky) around a little more than i like and sort of overpowers the taste buds for the next sip. I love hops and the flavors of hops but i can be picky about bitterness, especially when a beer is so mellow and well blended, such as this one. In the end, awesome DIPA."
"D: Like I said above, this beer is very drinkable. Great aroma flavor and mouthfeel contribute to a beer I could drink 'till incapacitation."
"The bottle i had was bottled on 2-24-2011. Everything abut this beer was Very Nice. The pour was very nice clear and clean. The smell off this beer was very inviting. There was a rich body and clean finish. There is nothing i can say bad about this beer except i can not get it on the east coast. HA HA"
"OK, I tried to keep it to one word but apparently I have to come up with 250 characters, damn you beer advocate. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (only 169 characters, huh). Anyway great beer that should only be shared with fellow beer enthusiast."
"O- Pliny is the real king of beers. in my opinion better than Pliny the Younger (and far more available)."
"Acquired this via trade. Bottled 12/17/10, drank 3/31/11. Great head. Nice citrus aroma and tast. Even better(fantastic) balance of flavor and hops. I would Def drink more if available in Florida. Did not beat my current fav DIPA Unearthly. Rock on Russian River!"
"I received this in a trade with dsgolovin (as an extra no less). Usually I won't drink a trade beer until both sides are complete (mine is still en route) however I couldn't pass on Fresh Pliny. Bottled 3/21/11. The beer pours a beautiful amber/gold with a nice tall head. The smell is citrus and orange, the taste is the same. I don't know if this is my favorite DIPA of all time, doesn't really matter it's damn good. I wish it was available locally. I've wanted to try this beer for a long time and I wasn't disappointed."
"pint-plus bottle from Mondo Vino, Denver"
"Final thought - Wish you could find this beer more often. Other than that. Can't say enough good stuff about this beer"
"o: tremendous brew...the creamy layer in the aftertaste is what I love most about this. the first few sips hit you very hard with the bitter hops, but as this warms and your palette adjusts this becomes easily the best IIPA I've ever had and you can see why so many people search for it and love it."
"I noticed myself developing an insatiable thirst for this hop juice. An absolutely amazing beer and highly recommended, Pliny The Elder is one of the best beers out there."
"OVERALL: I am very happy I finally tracked down a couple pints. The hype is well-deserved, but may have served to disappoint me just a bit. This is everything a Double IPA, and in my mind, a beer should be - almost perfect balance with an absolutely spectacular nose, but not quite the life-changing event some have made it out to be. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it would have been easy to keep drinking this stuff all night."
"It's excellent but quite honestly, it's certainly not THE best. Worth it though!"
"O: I tried not to let the hype surrounding this beer affect me too much, but this really is an exceptional beer. It's the most perfectly balanced DIPA I've had. It's not so much better than other IPAs/ DIPAs I've had (for example, Hopslam) that it blows them out of the water, but again, it is an exceptional beer."
"O: A great brew, for sure, but I'm not sure it is really worth all of the hype. It is also guilty of a new trend that I find to be exceedingly annoying; demanding that the customers consume the product immediately. I know, I know; hops fade with time, but does 6mos really make a huge difference over 3? All this nonsense achieves is the production of a new breed of ultra-annoying beer geeks."
"D-the hop flavors are in perfect proportion, nothing stands out and creates an unpleasant hop flavor. the grapefruit is so smooth and the malt is light but just present enough to allow this to be extremely drinkable. this is a world class beer, one of the best around."
"Overall, it didn't live up to expectations. I don't know what beer could have. It was a good IPA, but it was lacking something that I can't put my finger on to set it apart. That said, I would like to try a fresher bottle."
"Notes - It makes me really happy to have tried this beer, however it makes me ambitious to find ways to move to California so I can have it all the time."
"O: Awesome beer. Get me another now. Huge hops but well balanced and layers of flavor. I wouldnt change a thing about this beer."
"Appearance is amazing. Great copper color with a thick, foamy white head. This is the standard on what a DIPA should look like. Smells of citrus, earty and grassy hops. Before each drink I always take a second to take another sniff. Taste is absolutely amazing. Taste like bitter, bitter hops. A lot of grapefruit notes shine with every drink. This one doesn't lack any carbonation. Perfect mouthful with each drink. Overall this beer is one of the worlds best. If you don't believe me read the 1,000 reviews. I could drink this one all day everyday. Just a shame the distribution is so limited."
"Ok dont tar and feather me, but i feel this beer is overrated. Yes, it is a very good beer and a fine example of american IPA. My problem with it is that it is extremely hard to find, dam near impossible in bottles on the east coast. I had to travel from delaware to colorado to magically stumble upon this beer. I guess all the hype ruined it for me, but i would be perfectly happy grabbing a 90 minute or even a sierra nevada and avoiding the cost and hassle of tracking down this beer or even trading it. Try it to put the hype to rest but dont go too far out of your way..."
"Fantastic beer and very well balanced. Smooth and easy drinking. Goes down way too easily."
"This beer reminds me a lot of Bell's Hopslam in that it is an extremely touted beer that didn't immediately jump out to me as one of my favorites, but went extremely quickly until I was all out. Not that my review will be the difference maker, but it definitely would be good to get your hands on this and see if you think it's worth the hype."
"Oh the mighty Pliny... Waited quite a while to finally try to gem. I was tipped off by a gentleman that moved to Pa from Cali about where to get Pliny in our area. He spoke if the Spinnerstown Hotel as if it was a sacred holy land of beer... He wasn't too far off! Long story short about a year after he mentioned it to me I saw the S. Town Hotel got it in on tap! I wanted to leave work early that day and fly down there asap! I walk in the door and the same dude from a year ago is tossing back Pliny's like he just bought the keg. I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering """his""" beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it... Anyway it's got a lovely golden yellow color with a nice head in it. The aromas are breath taking. The flavors of pine like hops sting your mouth and make you beg for more. This beer is so tasty! I ordered 5 in a row that night. Coulda had 5 more, shoulda called a cab!"
"Cracked this beer after it was only 2 week old. Rich gold in color, clear and translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. It's almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except it's 8.0%ABV is inescapable. A truly magical representation of the DIPA breed with a drinkability unequaled to any but hopslam."
"Pliny is everything I want in a beer. This is definitely in my top 5! Excellent"
"Not overly hopped, and the ABV seems perfect. Excellent aftertaste. A wonderful overall experience that quickly jumped into my personal Top 10 on first try. Bravo!"
"The first bottle I had of this I did not like at all, but this 2nd one was well worth it. Pliny the Elder is a beer well worth the effort to find. A great smell and taste, a head that will leave great lacing, although the head did not last to long. Over all I will take the 2 hour drive just to find it when I want to pick up some more."
"Overall, this is a great DIPA. I love my IPAs with lots of tropical fruit, so this is right up my alley. It goes down way too easy for the 8% abv and I unfortunately only have 1 bottle."
"O: Again, was very disappointed in this beer, especially with all the hype it gets. Will not drink the other three I have in the basement."
"O- A Great beer. One of several times I've had it and enjoy it every time."
"overall its pretty much what the hype is, it may never leave my want list even if i end up with a fridge full"
"I went to Haven Gastropub at the Orange Circle and was shocked to see this beer on their ever rotating beer list. I quickly jumped to order it (thinking that the tap would run dry any second). I ordered it, and my server asked if I had heard of it or tried it at all. I responded with, """I've definitely heard of it, but this will be my first time trying it.""" He told met that I was in for a treat. He was right. This had a beautiful bronze coloring to it, that normal run-of-the-mill IPAs cannot accomplish. (to be perfectly honest-I don't even like IPAs that much!) However, this was AMAZING. I was a fan immediately by the fact that the nose was lovely and floral and the taste was the smoothest IPA with the most IPA flavor. It wasn't choking me with hoppy bitterness. Quite delicious, and it deserves every """A"" on this site."
"There is no beer that I've enjoyed that matches this one, except for perhaps PtY, and honestly I rate the Elder slightly ahead of the younger."
"A little dissapointed after all the hype. Not a very complex beer. Will not bore everyone with the details of every sip. The bitter finish and after taste is what kinda left me thinking...."""is that it""". Not a bad beer at all but not at the top Imperial IPA ever brewed. Now I must try PtY."
"Bottled on 2/17/11,fresh as well.Poured into an imperial nonic a rich burnt orange tinged golden with a large blooming white that left broken chunks of lace behind as it settled into a frothy mass.Much lighter aromas than expected,resin and grapefruit mixed with a firm dryer malt base,a little iron is in there as well.Resiny and bitter flavors are the main component flavor-wise,again the malt base is dry wich is good with way to many of the style to sweet.The alcohol is incredibly well hidden mainly because the sweetness is in check,its a very good beer but I gotta say I have had better of the style.While I like Hopslam,Dreadnaught,Oracle,and Hercules better, its a good beer,worth the rating?....Not so sure."
"pours a clear light gold/amber with a nice head that dissipates rapidly but leaves appropriate carbonation behind. smell, grapefruits and pine, taste, yummy, mouthfeel, beer. overall -- drinkability high."
"D- very drinkable, its almost kind of dangerous, 8% ABV and i easily took this down, the problem is that its fairly hard to get a hold of, this is what all other DIPA's should try to be"
"I fell in love with Pliny the Elder. Great job Russian River, you have created one of the greatest brews of all time. Very smooth, aromatic and.... DELICIOUS! Best enjoyed nice and chilled. I was delighted to enjoy this beer at Stone Brewery on my 21st birthday. What an honor."
"The anticipation of this brew really made the tasting tough on me. I was expecting to be absolutely blown away, and while the beer is very good, I wasn't. I think a few of the seasonal releases (Hopslam in particular) are better. This is still a very good beer. Its smoothness is unparalleled and the taste is really a good balance of a lot of flavors. If I had access to it all day everyday I'm sure I would drink more - but I don't."
"Well worth the hype. So glad I was able to pick up my first Pliny!"
"D. Yummy I will definately come here again Russian river rocks"
"Mouthfeel is fairly thin which doesn't bother me with this style. The lack of carbonation leaves the beer feeling flat and lifeless though. Finish is quite dry considering the sweet, malty flavor. Alcohol is well hidden. I'd like to try a super fresh example sometime but I think this is as fresh as it gets here on the opposite coast."
"Elder Pliny is dangerously drinkable! Here in the High Desert/San Bernardino county area it's hard to find though, so I'll probably stick with Green Flash Imperial @ $5 per 22oz bomber for my DIPA fix."
"D- Insane. Alcohol is not felt at all. Could drink many of these in a night. So thankful to have had this fresh on tap and lucky to get it when I did. This only fuels my love/hate relationship for hoppy beers in terms of degree of freshness, but this was as fresh as I coult of had it."
"Overall: I wasn't completely blown away to be honest. It was awesome, but I think the hype is a bit much. Definitely would seek this out on tap though, I'm sure nothing compares to week old Pliny. Still, a very awesome beer indeed."
"This was my first Pliny the Elder and after all of the phenomenal reviews, I had nothing but the highest of hopes. After my first attempt at the beer, I am impressed but at the same time not blown away or of the belief that this beer is """World Class""". I have had a couple other DIPA's on its same playing field that did not receive such rave reviews."
"D/O- Every sip left me wanting more immediately. Scary with an 8%ABV beer. The only that kept me from having more is I just had the one bottle, hah. Thanks to my friend Tara (and her cousin Eddie) for hooking it up big time!"
"If this isn't the best IPA/DIPA I've had it's certainly in the top three, well crafted, balanced, and delicious!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A good concoction of sweetness and bitterness. Easily drinkable thanks to the rewarding malt aftertaste. Quite dry on this finish. The ethanol is masked and blended very well. I feel like this should be classified more as an IPA as opposed to a double, but it is delicious none-the-less. Fairly excellent carbonation that is well-balanced."
"Bright gold appearance with a thick head. Pretty good looking beer in a tulip glass. Smells like a giant hop cone in a glass. Fresh floral aroma. Very appetizing for an IPA fan. The taste is very bold and pungent but does not linger. No long aftertaste or bitterness. I could drink this all day. No hype here. This is great beer."
"Thanks to Chris for flying this over from SF."
"This beer very much deserves to be way up on the list and as far as my tastes are concerned one of the few that actually lives up to the hype."
"Clear shaded orange with bubbly white head. Fresh hops, grass, light citrus in the nose. Tastes of citrus, peels, hop resin and bitterness towards the finish and a dry ending. Medium bodied, booze hidden masterfully by fresh hop flavor. Light carbonation make it easy drinking. It's a legend of beer and it lives up to the hype."
"Overall, I can understand the hype of this beer. It is a near perfect DIPA."
"Overall a wonderful beer that I reaaaallllyyyy wish came to Minnesota"
"This beer does well to accompany some tacos or nachos, or to throw back at some scenic relaxing vista like a creek or lake or mountainside, but on its own, it is merely an above average IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Lot's of hype has been built around The Elder and I'm glad that I finally got the chance to get my hands on it while it was still on the shelves at my local store. Living up to it's hype, and at a $5 price point, I will most definitely be returning to this ale in the future. An absolute delight!"
"This is one of those highly regarded beers with a hyped reputation that is good enough to deserve every bit of it."
"Drinkability: as delicious as this beer was, drinking several would probably getting tiresome as the hop flavor was, in my opinion, a little over the top. that being said, I strongly recommend it as one of the best IPA's I've had."
"Overall this is obviously a great beer. Is it the second coming of Christ? No but it is a very good approachable double IPA."
"Light, creamy body glides across your tongue. Eminently drinkable."
"Was at Whole Foods in Walnut Creek, CA checking out the beer selection today and noticed that they had pretty much every Russian River beer besides the Younger. Picked up a 500ml Pliny the Elder, bottled on 2-24-11, for $3.79. I have been wanting to try this beer for years and I was not disappointed. It deserves 6 stars. The best IPA I have ever had, and I have had many."
"Drinkability- A beer for beer lovers and for anyone else. A great all around IPA"
"Reviewed 03/05/11"
"Overall: PtE lives up to the hype. Two of my tasters were not fans of IPAs, they liked PtE."
"What else can you say? This is an excellent brew."
"The pour from the bartender was pretty shoddy, with very little head. Even without the head to bring out the aromatics of the beer, the nose had a huge punch of hop character full of apricot, pine, and grapefruit. The flavor had all of the above in full force with almost no malt to speak of and a big bitterness. It finished dry with an appropriate carbonation and a slight bit of onion character from the Simcoe hops. It's quite drinkable, but the lasting bitterness limits my ability to drink other beers afterwards."
"D - Imminently drinkable, this thing tastes light and clean. Drinks more like an IPA in my opinion, refreshing, but with that great balance."
"M/D: This beer goes down smooth, almost too smooth. It has the velvet consistency of an imperial stout with the hop kick of a double IPA. I could drink a lot of this purely on that attribute alone but the alcohol content reduces that thought a little bit. Overall an outstanding beer, but i think there are other IPA's i have been more pleased with."
"My first solid 5, and it's warranted. not only is this beer devoid of any significant flaw, it is the epitome of the West Coast Double IPA, a standard that hundreds of other breweries clearly aspire to (many fall well short) and a beer I can drink whenever, wherever (if only it were more readily available). Pours a gorgeous orange with a thick white cap and tons of lacing. Smells like a tropical citrus bonanza with plenty of pine. Pine is even more present in the taste. Drinkability is off the charts. I am beatng a dead horse with this review. Easily my favorite IPA, confirmed after having hundreds of IPAs and re-tasting this beer (fresh!) twice."
"A+"
"At the previously mentioned 8%, this beer is dangerous. With the exception of maybe Sculpin, Pliny is one of my favorite hoppy beers to drink. Its the right amount of alcohol and hops without destroying my palate like some west coast beers. Well balanced and delicious. Don't really have anything to complain about."
"D - One of the best double IPAs out there if not the best. No hints of alcohol taste at all and goes great with almost any type of food."
"Drinkability : crazy drinkability I could put these down all day long great beer always leaves you wanting another and this one succeed at this -- I need more Pliny"
"I was very reluctant to buy into the hype of this beer and tried to go in with an open mind, but the more I drink this beer the more I love it. A must try for any hop head."
"D- I could drink this all day. While it is a little dry, it is still very drinkable. Smooth and delicious, always a favorite."
"had this sucker at just a bit colder than room temperature. she's a pretty one. gold with a orange hue, white head. smells like grapefruit, pine, and how ipas smell when you imagine them. the citrus hops end strong in the nose. so this tastes great, i dig the shit out of it, but to me there's lots of other strong ipas that taste similar to this, (lagunitas's hop stoopid comes to mind), but that's not the point. why is this rated the best imperial ipa ever? whatever, i do enjoy this, a lot..."
"Overall, I would say my thirst for hops has been quenched... for now. Totally lived up to the hype."
"What really sets this beer aside from other Imperial IPA is mostly the crispness and clean finish. The bitterness is obviously present, but it kind of lacks that sharp """bite""" that other DIPA have when the flavor perception transitions from the nose to the tongue. In this regard, the flavor cannot get any better than it already is."
"this is it personally. it really is--haven't had younger yet though. but this it as far as DIPAs are concerned or any style I've come across. it seems the most exciting and excellent aspect attributed to this beer beyond the beer itself is its ability to fight the hype and deliver at the level of its reputation and beyond; this fact is something that not many beers can handle, personal preference aside."
"One of the more agressive beers I have tasted. However, very well balanced. The aftertaste is suprisingly clean. I have not had this on tap but it was excellent from the bottle. I had high expectations for the beer from all of the hype and it surely did not disappoint. Though the IBU's are high this was not a beer that you can only drink one of and complimented the steak that I was having. I highly recommend this beer but obviously am not the only one to think this. Great job Russian River."
"Sorry."
"Drinkability is exceptional. This is the finest balanced double ipa i have had to date. The amazing thing is that the alcohol, although very strong, is very undetectable as one enjoys a pint!"
"Drinkability: This beer is great. However, for the effort and price I will never make this a regular, which is a shame. PtE doesn't make a big statement, it makes an eloquent one. This is something I would regularly and I can save the big statement beers for special occasions. Distribution, price and production volume of course make this a pipe dream."
"D: Obviously I love this beer and will order and drink it whenever it's available. A+, great work RR."
"D- If I lived where I could get this... I'd be in trouble cause I'd buy cases of it!"
"D- Dangerously drinkable."
"D- This has everything I would want in an IIPA. Great hops flavor. This is very easy to drink for 8% ABV and very enjoyable. I wish I could get this by me, so good."
"This is a GREAT beer and am glad I went through the trouble to track it down and tried it, but not sure it's the """end all, be all""" its reputation would have you believe; I feel like I can get beers just as good or better locally without the hassle."
"The beer also looks and tastes like something that comes out of the tap, not the bottle. Drinkability is pretty exceptional I guess I can see why people want this beer so much."
"This was a damn good beer. Perhaps having a born on date of 2/7/11 has something to do with it."
"D: very very drinkable. I can't say this is the best impy ipa. There's a ton of discussion about how fresh to drink an ipa. I can't day this is the freshest, but a month out is not old by any means. An being continually refrigerated, the beer didn't lose that much beta acid."
"T: Slight peppery bite, lots of pine hops and grapefruit and resiny hops on the finish. The hops are well balanced and there, but not overpowering. A near perfect beer. One of the best IPAs I've ever had, but I think the Younger may have it beat."
"D- Yeah, if I lived near RR I'd definitely get into trouble knocking back a BUNCH of these. I wonder how one of these would taste with some age on it? I know that Hopslam has dropped dramatically in hop punch since I first drank one about 1 month ago and the one I had 2 nights ago."
"Honey/butterscotch in appearance with one finger head when poured that dissipates into a thin film. Pine Hoppiness in the nose, wish it was a little bit fresher, but cant really complain. Definitely a nice malt essence in the nose that compliments the hops very well. Taste is predominately piney with some citrus with the alcohol being very well hidden and then the bite from the bitterness comes in on the back end. The mouth feel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation. This beer is extremely drinkable and cant wait for the day I have it on tap. That will be a long day for sure, or short depending on how fast I take them back."
"Drinkability: This is the second time that I've had Pliny the Elder. The first time I split it with some friends. It even appealed to the non-beer drinking members of our group. Tonight the bottle belongs to me alone . I am delighted to relax with this lively and stimulating beverage. I am lucky enough to live close enough to the Russian River Brewing Company. But even close to my home this beer is hard to find. I will be buying more of this beer to share with my friends."
"Also had on tap at a local eatery that serves craft beers...when I tried to have some at the Stone Brewery they had just run out :( We were on a beer hunt for Pliny, once you taste it's deliciousness, you must have more! So piny in smell and taste-it's absolutely wonderful. Crisp fresh taste with a slight dry finish! If you can get your hands on this beer, it's a MUST!"
"Drinkability is very high. It was not difficult at all to finish the entire 500ml bottle and more would have been OK to. This was definitely a unique IPA for me. It seemed like it enhanced the usually subtle undertones from other IPAs and threw them in your face. This was so smooth for a 8% beer and I cannot wait till summer because this will be great on a hot day."
"At the end of this review, the reviewer is already mourning the loss of one of his prized bottles of Pliny the Elder. He is considering moving to California..."
"Future reviewers, please share your tips as well for max enjoyment of this great beer !"
"D: This is a perennial DIPA, it lived up to all the hype. Very well-balanced, everything a DIPA should be. Not a hint of the 8% ABV, just an excellent, well-rounded beer."
"All in all, everything its supposed to be. This has become the holy grail of hops. Glad to see this hype is well deserved. Very seldom do I have such a flawless, clean IPA with such a brilliant marriage of bitterness and sweetness."
"I've been drinking West Coast craft beer for more than 25 years and I've probably drank most of the the top-rated West Coast IPAs/DIPAs out there...Pliny is right there at the top of my list---believe the hype."
"Drinkability: Great beer. Remember to drink this one at the right temp, so you can truly enjoy this great brew."
"What can I say about this ale that hasn't previously been mentioned? Let me start by stating that I am a Chef. For years I have been writing menus and creating dishes around a wine list...so I guess I sort of understand flavor pairings. When it comes to beer, I am still a novice. Pliny is a perfect shellfish pair along the lines of a great Sauvignon Blanc. Many citrus aftertones, especially those of Ruby grapefruit and yuzu.Would work well with sashimi, crudos and ceviche. Can't wait to get my hands on more elder and hopefully get to taste the younger"
"hophead, or no hophead - seek this beer out."
"D- This could easily be a chugger if not for the alcohol. I tend to drink this beer in huge gulps and wait for the lengthy aftertaste to subside before taking the next."
"I was extremely excited to try this beer, i had to bribe a co-worker to bring it back from CA for me. Drank it on 01/07/11, bottled on 12/17/10 so the hops were there in full force. For the build up to trying this, I was some what let down. The hops were bright and powerful, but I felt it lacked a malt backbone. I do enjoy west coast IPA's, but I just felt the beer wasn't balanced enough for all of the hype. I know that is sacrilege on here, but that's how I feel, personally I prefer a more malt balanced DIPA, like a DFH 90 min or Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. Overall it was a good beer, but not at the level I had been reading."
"The general characteristics have already been described much better than I know how. Suffice to say, however, that I dislike the west coast IPAs that try to outhop each other and end up with a bitter mess. Pliny is so well-balanced; the hops so delicate but powerful at the same time; and the finish so bracing but not bitter that it is easy to call this one of the best (if not the best) beers I have ever had."
"Drinkability: A fine double IPA. Worthy of being sipped and savored. My first Russian River brew, would love to try more from this brewery. Similar to a Nugget Nectar."
"9/10"
"This is a quality brew--no doubt. You don't need my review or opinion to know that. I am certainly glad I've had the opportunity to try this beer and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can think of other beers in my cellar I'd go to before this one which is part of the problem with IPAs for me--I don't want to feel rushed to drink them. This one was as fresh as it gets but I might have saved it for another night, a special occasion, etc. I guess the special occasion was tonight--lucky me."
"Notes: someone else mentioned this as well, but the minimalist labeling is dope. I dig the whole minimalist movement, and am a minimalist at heart. Just goes to show you, you don't need a multi-billion dollar marketing budget to sell your beer when you are making good beer to begin with."
"I scored this as high as I could in all categories while leaving some room for improvement but good luck trying to do that. I was expecting to be not bowled over after the previous reviews but the rating reflects this ale accurately. Superb."
"Drink this beer!"
"D- Very good beer. One of the best labels I've seen and I will certainly seek it out again"
"Reasonably priced for being so expensive to brew. The fact that it is still difficult to get in CA shows that there is no compromise made by the Russian River brewing company. All about quality not quantity. Well done ."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Does it live to the hype? Sorta. I'm amazed by the mouthfeel and drinkability, definitely perfect in that aspect, but Ive had better hop profiles in the nose and taste. I guess it is a matter of personal preferences at this point. Glad I had this beer and would most definitely have it again, wish it was easier and cheaper to get it here on the east coast."
"Smooth as can be, this beer shows a love of the craft. Those who can get this off the shelf are lucky souls. The DIPA category is chock full of good beers, and I've had a handful that are as good as what's in my glass now. That said, I've never had one better, and I'm glad I had the chance to savor this icon of American Craft Brewing."
"Finally got my hands on a few bottles from John's Marketplace in Portland. Upon opening, the smell of fruit wafted out. The hops hadn't quite opened yet. It poured a hazy, golden orange. Tons of sediment and carbonation present. Upon pouring, this really opened up the nose with lots of grapefruit and apricot. The first few sips were heavy with apricot and citrus, but the back end packs a good hop bite. As the beer warmed up, the hops were more prominent, and the beer kept good head retention. I was surprised at how fruity this beer was, but how it balanced out so beautifully with the hops. Will definitely reach for another if given the chance."
"D - Could not stop drinking"
"Although my bottle is only approximately a month old, I look forward to the opportunity of trying an even fresher sample on tap as I hear the freshest Elder is above and beyond."
"D - a very drinkable IPA; not session-able - just a bit too big"
"Drinkability: Generally, I don't care for any form of IPA's, nevertheless, I think this beer is very pleasant. It definitely lives up to its hype. At first I thought it would be like any other Double IPA but this beer is certainly unique; it is one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. I just wish it were more available."
"D - it's pretty good to drink. Perhaps a bit too dry, but it's ok."
"So what is the statement that Pliny the Elder is making? Northern California in a bottle. And it works - you can smell, taste, and revel in the Sonoma County sunshine with every sip, cannabis not even required!"
"Pours a clear orange with a lot of white head. Good lacing. Not as pretty as some but a good looking beer nonetheless. Sells hoppy pine, Somme light citrus. Tastes bitter and piney. Ha ha ... Too corny. But honestly, it's a bit too one dimensional for me. It's certainly a solid dipa but not as impressive as abrasive and hopslam. Overall, a solid beer but in the 3 or 4 times I've had it i haven't been all that impressed"
"This beer is not in competition to be the biggest beer or the most hops. Rather, it presents a manifestly smooth but powerful hop. Lush tropical fruity hops dominate. It's like hop juice distilled to the perfect point."
"On a night of some great IPA's, this one really stood out. A very good looking beer, clear with a decent head. Not overly hoppy or carbinated, and easy to drink. Recommended by the bartender, and I was glad I listened to him. The smell was very fruity for an IPA and that great smell transfered well to the taste. I will be seeking out more Russian River beers in the future."
"D: most IPAs get low marks from me here, but this one is quite smooth and easy to put back. Doesn't get much better for an IPA. Wish I could get this back home in Brooklyn..."
"D: Very drinkable. It is too bad that Russian River can't keep up with demand."
"D - Fabulous. Glad to be visiting the LA area where it is available. Wish I could have this every day. Tastes as good in the bottle as when I've had it on draft. The only difference is tonight for some reason I'm getting a little more biscuit/chocolate malt flavor than I remember on draft. I'm diggin' it though."
"D- believe the hype! This brew is the real deal. Not only are all the properties off the charts.... but also it's scary drinkable. I can only imagine living in Caly and getting this all the time. What a winner this brew is! What an experience!"
"All U Hopheads Must Seek it Out!"
"Final Comparison: Both Hopslam and Pliny the Elder were decent brews. They both looked fantastic and were enjoyable in their own way. They were very different from each other as well. Hopslam was more balanced with a stronger malt presence, as well as a bigger alcohol punch, while Pliny was a straight up pine bomb. In the end, if I had to choose one, I think I'd chose Pliny, but there are others in the style I'd have first."
"Drinkability: For a Double IPA it is fairly drinkable but with the mouthfeel issues that I had with it I think that it certainly is not an everyday beer. If you find this beer try it, but its not the best around."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, and goes way too fast. This is leagues ahead of many other DIPAs just for that sheer fact alone. It's a hop bomb but somehow hides that fact with just the right amount of balance."
"D - Good at 8%, wish I had more"
"D - I could drink this every day, all day."
"I would LOVE to review this on tap; I'm sure that this would be the A+ beer that I see others reviewing it as. If anyone wants to send me a super fresh bottle just send me a BM and we can work it out.... ;)"
"Like some women, the following is due in part to it's inaccessibility (it's is still just a beer), but it's the most well crafted beer in the US and a must try for even the casual beer fan."
"D- very drinkable. Suprised by abv. Wish I could have easy acess to it!"
"of course this is so drinkable, i tryed to savor the glass, but it still went way too quickly. if this was available at stores around me, it would for sure be a staple in my fridge. this met my expectations, didnt exceed them, but definatly didnt fail them. i had high expectations. went very well with a moldy, stinky blue cheese."
"Not too much new to say about this excellent IPA. Delicious from start to finish. Bright orange head with piney and citrus aromas. Excellent carbonation and well balanced hops, very lively in the mouth. Excellent IPA and extremely easy to consume."
"I had high expectations about this beer, its reputation certainly preceded it because it seemed to appeal to most beer drinkers. This is a beautiful beer, it has good color and looks quite appealing, however I thought that the mismatch of its grapefruit aroma and it's highly tart smell and it's low citrus draw made it oddly unstable on the palate. The extreme hop flavor was overpowering and only on the back end did I get any of what I was expecting. The taste is, as an Imperial IPA should be, a kick in the face of flavor, but it left me confused and wondering what the brewers thought when they tasted this paradox of smell versus taste. There are other Imperial IPAs that are true to their aromatic profile and I think that this beer seems to be an ultra-hopped beer in disguise. A good beer, but not something that I would tout as an example of a perfect beer."
"This is a very aromatic IPA that is a delight to drink. The only problem is that you will drink it too fast and its hard to refill. The beer pours a golden color and has just the right amount of head. the beers smells like fruits and has the right amount of hops. I just wished i had an elder to compare this too."
"M This beer was medium to full body and medium to high carbonation.  Carbonation was apprpriate for the beer. 4.5"
""
"This really is what other double IPA's should be measured against and Russian River has done an outstanding job with the upped production. I love the fact that I can walk down to the local WF and pick up a couple of these pretty much anytime."
"drinkability is good but i hate to say it without me eating any food to balance out that bitterness i would not drink another back to back"
"Girlfriend also preferred this off the tap as compared to the bottle, and it was clear and crisp as opposed to the bottle we had that had hazy bits floating in it. This was crystal clear, smooth, great taste, nice hop profile, and not overly bitter with a clean linger finish. Very very nice. This was roughly $3 for 8oz off the tap if I remember right, and locally by the 16oz bottle it runs about $5.99 or so - so very nice for a bar price and a bottle price. Definitely recommend..."
"Pliny The Elder is true to its reputation. I'm looking forward to partaking in this one again!"
"clear gold colored ale, with a medium to light head that quickly disapates. Lots of flaoties. Well balanced smell between floral and earthy hops. Sharp tastes that follows both the smell and style quite well. Medium carbonation creates a refreshing mouthfeel. Very drinkable. This beer is extremely well balanced and a perfect example of the style. Does not blow me away, which may be a freshness issue, but a solid effort within an exemplary style."
"~ This is an excellent drinker. The 'head' is topped by nearly none. I look forward to again sampling this fine brew in the future."
"D: What can I say? I still don't get the hype about this beer. It does taste like heaven in my mouth, and I'll drink it any chance I get."
"Pours a clearish golden color with a nice decent head of white foam when poured aggressively. The smell is of piny Pliny...sorry I couldn't help myself. I like how the backer too it is sweet in nature after the strong hop citrus notes on the palate. There is a malt bill note to the beer that I must admit give it a nice overall balance. This beer is extraordinarily easy to drink."
"My first Pliny experience definitely matched the hype. I loved that it's just 8% and not a stereotypical hop bomb. It's an inviting and complex brew. A crowning achievement for the guys at Russian River."
"Sublime. The accolades that this beer receives are well deserved indeed. Pliny the Elder is a brilliant example of the style and I can now see why it's at the top of everyone's list. Thanks Jared."
"This beer was very drinkable for a IIPA. A very refined and complex beer."
"D: high, high, love it"
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. The appearance was amber red with a slight hop haze and beautiful white head that laced the glass. Aroma was thick with grapefruit, pine, grass and other tropical fruits. The taste follows suit. A thick hop flavor with a great balance between the hope and malts. Lighter body moderate carbonation. A treat for your senses."
"Could drink these for days on end if they didn't ring in at $8 a pop for 12 oz. A beer that lives up to all expectations and still excites on that first taste."
"This double IPA poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled but clung and coated the inside of the glass a bit. The smell was fruity, spicy hops with not much malt. The taste was grassy, fruity hops with a good bit of malt to balance. The hoppy flavors lingered very nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth, dry, and very hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish was slightly astringent. This was a very nice and very hoppy double IPA."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and right up there with the best double ipas I've ever had. Difficult to obtain, but well worth it when it is sitting in your glass at the end of the day."
"d- I want some more of this beer went down easy. Almost too easy"
"This beer hids it's booze well in the taste, but I haven't eaten lunch and I can feel it in my head. This review is taking me forever. "
"D - For an 8% beer it is highly drinkable. You would not think the abv was even that high. This brew lives up to the hype; although the chase for this beer can be a nuisance it is always greatly rewarded."
"I must make a trip to Russian River and Toronado to sample the """fresh""" Pliny. This is a world class IPA and I can't imagine how good it must be within days of bottling/tapping."
"This really lives up to the hype, period. Thanks again Augustgarage for the experience."
"I had two of these before deciding to review, the first was almost 2 months old and the latest was just a month old. I must say the younger beer was better (this surprised me, as I was skeptical with regard to """how fresh""" people have said you need to drink this beer). To my taste the older beer had far more of a pine flavor, the citrus was barely there, hidden in the background behind a big pine cone. The younger had the taste I described above."
"D - Way easy to drink. I love the smell and flavor of this brew. I've been drinking a lot of DIPAs lately and this one is up there, although I do enjoy Abrasive much more :) Solid brew from Russian River and is also on my seeking list."
"The mouthfeel is great for this one. The carbonation goes great with thr flavoeing of the beer and it goes down very smooth for an IPA. I had 4 of these so far and they have all been great. Honestly I would really take their warning and drink them right away."
"D - oh so drinkable, one of the great beers out there."
"Updated: Tried a more fresh batch from January 2011 and this beer tasted way better than the December batch. Therefore, I've upped my rankings from a B to A."
"I see what the hub-bub is about, but I honestly feel there are other DIPAs out there that are just as good. WOuld love to have this again, but maybe not worth jumping through hoops to get it again here in Massachusetts."
"In terms of hoppiness, bitterness and fruitiness on both the nose and flavor, the West Coast DIPAs easily trump the East coast variants and the Ruination sits on top when it comes to bitterness; Hopsickle ranks second and PtE third (Ruination and Hopsickle were considered a bit too bitter). The East Coast DIPAs were just touched with just a slight bitterness that was no where near the intensity of the West Coast IPAs. Appearance wise, none of them are stunners or a big story to bring home but the Hopsickle and the PtE looked a cut above the rest. The most easy drinking of these DIPAs (without too much of a flavor comparison here) would have to be the DFH 90 with the PtE following in second place."
"D-One of the best of its style."
"D: A beguiling brew to be sure, this beer is famous not for the intensity of the qualities it presents, but for the way they are united so seamlessly in the final product. Pliny the Elder is so surprisingly smooth that it could change a lot more drinkers' minds about extreme/traditional/artisanal beer styles, if only more had the awareness and ability to seek it out. From the tap or out of the bottle, every encounter with it is made to seem like the first--which is perhaps one of the most favorable attributes any food or drink could hope to aspire to."
"Poured on-tap at the San Diego Brewing Co brewpub. They had it on guest tap while we were visiting. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a cloudy, golden-copper color with a thin, foamy head. The beer has smells of hops and pine, with lemon-lime notes. The flavor ursts in mouth, with citrusy-sweet notes surrounded by the bitter-greens from the hops. Perfectly balanced and smooth in mouth, with a crisp finish. There is a light, sour balance to the bitter aftertaste, and no linger despite the strong flavors and characteristics. Wow! I think I just made a mess in my pants! I'm glad I got to try this on-tap for my first PtE. Now I am just looking forward to the next time I can find it!"
"Oh how I wish this was available in Texas....but alas, I'll have to stick with good Avery and Bear Republic offerings instead....and the occassional Lagunitas Sucks when I can get my hands on it."
"Notes - I ordered this because Russian River makes some good beer. I hadn't researched this beer prior to drinking, and ordered it blindly. Im so glad I did. Really wonderful fresh flavorful beer with tons of character."
"Awesome. Huge citrus flavors, orange and pineapples. Just a wonderful beer. Super drinkable. Light body with medium carbonation."
"The CPJ"
"The standard for a style I don't always appreciate. Drinking this now, it brings back memories of sub-par DIPAs of the past, really putting them to shame. Other DIPAs roam the earth, ghostlike, growing ever staler and hoping to be like Pliny. Vinnie does no wrong."
"Hands down the best IPA I have had to date. There have been a few beers on here that had excellent ratings that I found disgusting (Celebrator Doppelbock that tasted like rancid soy-sauce), but this concoction was great. Highly recommend it to people who think all IPAs are just hop-bombs."
"For the record, my first perfect 5 scoring. And well deserved."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a very smooth drinking beer. It's a bit on the light side with very fine carbonation. Is this beer drinkable? Hell yes, so much so that it borders on supernatural. I had to force myself to slow down and savor. Really a great beer and deserving of it's spot in the beer world."
"I write this beer review not to inform the unaware public of the greatness of this brew, but rather to use it as a badge of honor to prove the fact that I actually landed a rare bottle. The appearance of this beer is light gold and filled with sediment, less than a finger width of head on top. The smell is actually not nearly as pronounced as I figured it would be, though the citrus and hops do come across. The taste is what this legend is made of though. A strong citrus hop flavor, a warm alcohol finish, a malty back bone throughout, this beer is obviously a winner. It's well balanced and highly drinkable (if only I had another to drink...). Overall one of the better beers I've had the privilege to consume. Now I know what the fuss was about."
"Too bad this, along with the other RR beers, is/are so popular that bottles are so scarce."
"Pours a light yellow gold color with a white head. Smells of citrus and piney hops. Nothing overwhelming, but good. Flavor is balanced. Extremely balanced. Hoppy, not sweet, but all in harmony with the beer. Masterfully crafted such that everything falls into place. Not a syrupy iipa by any means, this is smooth and drinkable. This is what other iipas should be compared to. Not a transcendent experience like some have claimed - this is like drinking the best of the old guard, the invention of the style. Basically, a fantastic mold for an idea that has lead to an enormous collection of delicious beers. To be respected and tried (more than once)."
"Though there are other west coast double IPAs worth seeking out, your experience isn't complete without one or more Pliny bottles."
"All in all it lived up to the hype and was as I said the best beer I've ever had. I can't wait to find the one the beats it for me :)"
"would definitely recommend this beer to anyone looking for a hop bomb, and I would love to get the chance to try another one, especially one with the proper carbonation so I could re-review it."
"(69)"
"Overall, this is one of the top class beers on the planet for a reason; it's the epitome of great intense flavor yet retrained to dominate too much in any one category. I had this beer when I was a hop newbie and I hated it, but I am having it now right after a Hopslam and I have to say I enjoy this more for it's retrain and yet amazing flavor profile."
"The nose was really big with all of the standard floral hop notes. The taste was the same with a mouthfeel a little too thin to support the flavor. No major development over time, just a slight transition to a very clean aftertaste."
"Comments: I wonder what this beer would taste like if it was very fresh rather than being bottled 7 weeks ago. Next Pliny needs to be fresher. However, even after spending a near two months in a bottle, the Pliny was still better than many DIPAs."
"Notes: I had a fresher bottle a couple nights ago (it was bottled 11-22 versus 11-12) and it seemed harsher all around than this one, with less of a malt backbone. I tend to doubt 10-12 days can make much of a difference, so I'm crediting/blaming the previous beers I'd had that night for making this beer seem harsher then than I feel it is now."
"The drinkability is perfect, each sip leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth that lingers until youre ready for the next one."
"EDIT2: I had on tap at Blue Dog in Lansdale, PA. Much better. Way more balanced and hoppy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for a DIPA. No booziness despite the 8%, and the bitterness wasn't over the top, which is more to my liking. If it were more available to me this would probably be my go to for a strong hoppy beer. Alas, I'm on the East Coast so its not."
"Saved a great one for number ten. Bottled 12/17, found this beauty at pizza port bottle shop after a long day at legoland. Poured hard into my new belgium glass with a straw yellow with nice head and lacing. Nothing out of the ordinary for the style. Smell was just ok not over the top. Taste was phenomenal. Drinks great. Cheers."
"Without question I give two Schlitz for this beer. I know that I'm not going to come across Pliny the Elder very often in Michigan, so I'm certain that it will be a treat every time that I have the privilege of drinking it."
"Just happen to find this at Collins Pub in Seattle and finally get taste what the rave is all about. Appearance has a light yellow amber with a nicley held head leaving nice lace. Smell of big malt, piney, citrus grapefruit with a big hop aroma. Taste was more mild in the hops than what came out in the aroma, but still foral and complex. A very clean honey malt sweetness that balance very well with the hops with no interference of alchohol. Mouthfeel is a nice medium with good carbonation. I was not to be dissapointed with this one, this is a very clean easy drinking ale that has to be one of the best I've tried."
"Drinking this makes me feel like I finally understand beer. Pliny the Elder takes my appreciation, affinity, and love for beer to the next level. I take comfort in the fact that I know I won't ever taste anything better than this, because nothing should ever be better than this. This is the absolute perfect beer. I am truly blown away. I am amazed that human hands crafted this. I feel like I should write a thank you note or a note of congratulations to the brewers with a tip. It's amazing."
"Gift of good friend Paul B. Hop bomb. Poured with a small off white head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber. Aroma is firstly and foremost hops, then some malt and butter. Flavor follows nose, just much more massive. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and long. Little overmuch for my taste."
"D: I could drink this DIPA all day long. Absolutely delicious. Would like to try again without the food to distract my palate."
"Overall, a wonderful beer for sipping in front of a fire on a cold, snowbound night."
"This was my first trip to California and I walked a long distance hoping to just get a bottle of the blind pig, when I stumbled upon several bottled of this. I picked it up at the OC Wine Mart in Irvine. I sampled this on 11/9, and it was bottled on 10/8. It poured gold with a thin white head and a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma wasn't as itense as I expected considering all I had heard about this beer. I started to wonder whether this had been way overrated, but that all changed once I had tasted it. It had a wonderful piney hop taste without very much booziness or carbonation. This is the first time I had to travel to seek out a hard to find beer (at least on the east coast) and while it may not be the best beer on the planet, it is definitely the best IPA on the planet. This is not a beer that I would consider overrated, it definitely lives up to its reputation."
"d. i wish i had a whole case to last me a few months. these are amazing brews."
"There's a reason this is legendary, and it's apparent from the first sip to the last. Beautiful brew."
"Finally got to try PtE. It was a pleasure."
"An amazing, highly drinkable beer. When I first tried it, after hearing all the hype, I was a bit taken aback. But Pliny insists that you slow down and contemplate. And if you do, it rewards."
"a lot of hype surrounding this beer so i knew it was going to be good. the appearance is dark orange. kind of cloudy. the smell is like pine and citrus. the beer poured with about a 1""" head that dissipated pretty quickly. taste is sweet and hoppy. bitter at the end too. if i had to compare it to another IPA i'd compare it to Southern Tier 2XIPA. real high drinkability for 8% ABV, they hide it very well. good mouthfeel, light carbonation. A really good Double IPA, but in my opinion a lot like many other beers of the same style. it's very good and a great example of the style. i would like to have more of them."
"D: I could crack bottles of this all day, as well as drink it from draft. The fact that this beer is some what hard to get makes it fall a little low in drinkability section. Really great brew that is a must try."
"Drinkabilty - Insanely high. Its very bitter but with no alcohol taste, man you can slam this. Its a great beer but i dont know if its quite as good as everyone says. Lack of production, avaibilty helps this out imo. Is a top ten beer yes, is it the best? Theres beers like dreadnaught and ruination out there that would disagree."
"D: This may not be my favorite, but it's a close competitor. Very good experience."
"Yup! Bottled 11/30/2010 so nice and fresh. Thanks for taking the extra effort to send me this beer. Always a treat to get PtE on the east coast."
"I have found my personal nectar of the gods. All of you who live out west and can get this easily should count yourselves lucky."
"Pliny the Elder is a beer that lives up to the hype. If you're a fan of IPA's or hoppy beers, this is a must try. If you're new to IPAs and start with Pliny, you'll be spoiled. If it's possible to have a session Double IPA, this is it! I could easily see drinking several of these."
"D: What can I really say about this that hasn't already been said? If you don't like hops, this probably won't change your mind. But if you're a hophead, just about any effort to obtain a fresh bottle is justified. Make no mistake: this is the real deal."
"D - excellent. My first taste of Russian River and I am pleased."
"D: Bought four... will they be there tomorrow?"
"It was just as good as I remembered. Pliny the Elder is really is the gold standard of IPAs. I really hope to try Pliny the Younger someday."
"Edit- Added bottled date."
"Cheers"
"I can only hope to find this on tap some where. Yum."
"O: Extremely drinkable and refreshing beer. Very bitter but, at the same time, smooth and pleasant. A perfect beer"
"This is the best beer I ever had. Words don't do it justice. If you like full flavor beer do yourself a favor and find a bar or pub that has this epic poem to the beers gods on tap. you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to try piney the younger, I've heard that's even better."
"Pours a light straw orange amber, semi-cloudy with a one finger off white head. Nice lacing remains. The nose is perfection; citrus and pine hops blended with a malt backbone. Taste is sublime; a hop forward IPA - bitter in the middle and lingers long into the finish. Pine is noticable upfront with light citrus notes. Maltiness is blended so well. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Such a drinkable beer! If only this was available here, it would be my beer of choice every day. Amazing."
"D - Definitely one of the best I've had. Right up there with Hopslam."
"Pours with a medium sized sticky head, golden color, slightly hazy. Aroma is,uh, hoppy; nice pine and citrus with some cannabis notes. Taste is much like aroma, plus slight sweetness and alcohol. A little sticky on the tongue - a good thing for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium all around, dried out by alcohol but sweetened by fruity hop flavors. Bitterness is slightly harsh, a little out of balance with the hop flavor. I can't really say I'm disappointed with a beer this tasty but it doesn't quite live up to the legend. In fact, I preferred the Blind Pig we had just prior to Pliny. It might be an age thing - my bottle was bottled on 11/11 and drank on 12/11... I hope to someday have it fresh on draft."
"As the head hinted - excellent carbonation. It carries the flavours expertly, acting like velvet wheels on a royal carriage. I could talk about how well the alcohol is disguised, or the way in which the crisp freshness and bitter hops sit in perfect balance with the oxymoronic charismatically-modest malts. But what needs to be noted is that this brew is iconically quintessential. It's like a chic elite party. Everyone who's anyone is in attendance; they've all come out looking their best; and everybody mingles with flawless, elegant etiquette. To read a review is like looking at the photos the next day - you can get a idea of what went on, but the only way to capture the true atmosphere is to attended yourself."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp. Feels relatively light for a DIPA. Overall, its an amazing beer. Very smooth and easy drinking, one of my favorites."
"Glad I got 3."
"You definitely should try it given the reputation this has but I recommend you do so with an open mind and try your best not to buy into the hype. Its definitely enjoyable and if DIPAs are your thing, you are probably required by law to try this one. I also can't wait to try the rest of the Russian River line up. Cheers!"
"Really quite good, and I can see what much of the hype is about. I tried to make sure that I did not approach this beer with my expectations too high (based on the tremendous amount of hype), and was very happy with this west coast style IIPA."
"I wish I could write more about this beer, but not until I visit Vince in California and drink this on tap."
"This beer is hella drinkable but should be savored too, in order to experience it at various temperatures. I don't know that i've had an (double) ipa in which flavor characteristics change so much as it warms. A fantastic beer overall. Split it with a worthy friend to enjoy the perfect amount."
"D - I think I could drink this every day for the rest of my life. With out a doubt one of the best DIPA on the market today. My personal favorite, thats for sure. I am so glad I live near philly."
"Drink is unreal easy to drink. No alcohol detected. You'd think a beer with this high of IBU's would be hard to drink more than one but I could drink a few of these before feeling completely overtaken with hoppy glory. Sadly, only bought one bottle due to the big price tag and limited availability. Thank you Russian River for making my night just awesome. I'll be tasting those hops till tomorrow morning."
"D - Very drinkable for a IIPA. In fact it's too drinkable. The word masterpiece comes to mind."
"If I had easy access to this I'd drink it every day if I could. Such a smooth tasty DIPA. I feel fortunate to have a friend out in Northern Cal to ship me these. I have 5 more left and it pains me that I'm going to share a couple of these with others, but I want to spread the love."
"D - It is unfortunate that the abv has to be 8%, because of this I cannot drink enough of this beer. I am too drunk before I am satisfied."
"Served in a Stella chalice. Two fingers of creamy foam. A deep golden reddish hue is welcoming me to drink. Smells of rich hop goodness. In the mouth, a perfect balance of hoppiness and fine rich malt. Finishes dry and repeat. A customer gave me this and I thank him very much."
"I'm a little conflicted, I really did enjoy it, but I enjoy this style. I wasn't as blown away as I expected. I guess I just gave into the hype. I'd love to review it again sometime and get the opportunity to review a fresh one. It's not available in MA so I gotta trade for it. I feel lucky just to have the opportunity to try it, and I don't think it'll be the last. Who knows maybe some day I'll get to CA and get to review a fresh one, sounds like a pretty good day."
"This has got to be one of the most drinkable 2xIPAs I have had. The hops levels meet the maltiness just right allowing the beer to be enjoyed for what it is while my general experiences of 2xIPAs usually results in a muddle of malts and hops. PTE is smooth, spicy, sweet, dry, floral and citrusy IPA that is simple in terms of enjoyment, yet complex once one delves into it."
"D. A true pleasure, and something everyone should try. I cannot even begin to think of what I would do to get this distributes in my area so that I could savor it more often."
"Drinkabilty - This is a great example of a American Double IPA, was it over hyped ? Not in my opinion -This would be the standard I would measure any American Double IPA with. Very drinkable - I really enjoyed this, to bad it's not more readily available to the Midwest Great lakes area ."
"D-This is stellar. It has every key component of perfection. Minus the fact that I cant go to a store and buy this every day. Im beyond impressed and amazed. Now im going to finish the bottle. I really hate to claim a beer is flawless....if I think of one ill add it later."
"Drinkability: There is a reason that I always get this on draft whenever I can, this is insanely drinkable and I've never been disappointed by one of these."
"I can only imagine this on tap."
"drinkability - at ~$5 for 500ml, not gonna go through a lot of it, but this is a nice drinking beverage that I would gladly revisit as this is a style that admittedly I am not a huge fan of, but this was really good, it actually had me yearning for another"
"Like everyone, I'll just point out that if this were more readily available in bottles, I'd buy a case every couple of months. Really lovely, even surpasses Ruination IPA in terms of west coast DIPA glory."
"D: It would be a 5 if only it weren't 8%, and the bitterness faded just a little faster."
"Basically the drinkability is please may I have another. If you have not tried this beer get one fresh and don't wait to drink it. If you like IPAs you will love Pliny."
"Finally my first Pliny. Poured into my favorite westmalle chalice. Beer is a darker shade of orange but still glowing. The smell is a perfect balance of sweet and acidity. The sweet is pineapple tanderine and the acidic is orange and a hint of lemon zest. Taste is off the wall! Ive always said that a perfect beer is well balanced. This one comes as close to percfection as it gets. The mouth feel is soft and inviting. I could drink this all day long."
"D - So nicely done that it really is one that could be had all day. The hops are so well integrated that it doesn't kill the palate like most big IPA's can do. Excellent work."
"This brew pours a non see through honey hue with nice carbonation and lacing everywhere,the smell is beautiful with notes of floral bouquets,honeydew,honeysuckle and stonefruit,and with the taste it just gets better the mouthfeel is ever so smooth and exudes flavours of passionfruit,honeydew,lychees,some very light pale malts and finishes with a super smooth tiny tinge of stonefruit bitterness but to be honest this bitterness is not really bitter its just so right its not funny and overall this is one exceptional brew that im so glad ive tried and to be honest its right up there with the best beers i have sampled and the only other thing i can say is Russian River know how to brew beers."
"The flavor of the beer was like drinking a citrus juice. I could swear I tasted some grapefruit pulp in there... There were some nice piney hop notes, too. The malt backbone was solid, but definitely more of a role player. This beer reminded me a lot of (512)'s IPA, but it finished a lot cleaner and was more balanced. The carbonation was wonderful and I kept coming back for more sips. I started the night with this beer and I had to come back to it to finish the night, too. Just a fantastic DIPA."
"turns out I've been drinking this forever and never reviewed it... great IPA, second best to the younger. well its safe to say I love the pliny's. it is light yellow with little to no white head. smell is biiig hops, pine and citrus. its slightly floral, but not like roses, like citrus blooms. taste is amazing. massive hops with amazing balance. it fills my mouth with joy. also very drinksble"
"Had another sample which is about 4 weeks old compared to the 7 week old previous sample. The hops have a much more """buddy""" flavor to them. They kind of taste like what weed smells like and I like that. All of the other stats remained constant."
"Well done, Russian River! Also, check out their Sours...amazing."
"Cheers!"
"----UPDATE--- Yeah, it was the freshness, and that the beer was unsettled. This is a damn great beer. Fresher, cleaner, crisper. Goddamn. Hell yes. Also note: causes the girlfriend """beerface"""."
"The Elder has plenty to offer that I look forward to taste The Younger!"
"D - Extremely. I can drink this all the time. I wish RR distributed to NY :( 5.0"
"Drinkability- Exceptional. Smooth and rough enough to quench an IPAer's taste buds."
"D: this beer is a fantastic beer to sit and enjoy. its balance and carbonation promotes good drinkability."
"D: Exceptional. More please!"
"This is the platonic ideal for an IPA in my eyes. It's not as interesting (tropical) as some others. It's singularly focused. And pretty much perfect."
"D: I don't have to tell you...this beer is amazing. This is not the first time that I've been lucky enough to have this and I can't wait for the next. To date my favorite IPA."
"There's a reason this beer is so hyped... and you only need to drink one to find out!"
"Cheers..."
"Drinkability - This is a very good beer, i am quite proud to say i have tried it and enjoyed it! too bad we cant get volumes of this in Canada, but i am thankful."
"This is the third or fourth time I've had Pliny, but the first from the bottle. This beer definitely lives up to expectations. The beer is pale amber color with a little rocky white head. However, as soon as you open up the bottle, the beer explodes with beautiful aroma. The smell is intoxicating, like super dank marijuana, just cut pine bows and freshly peeled grapefruit. The beer is overloaded with hops, it tastes just like it smells and the dank chronic flavor just envelopes my tongue, I think I'm about to getting high from this! There is just a hint of pineapple juiciness and grain sweetness that accompanies the long lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel has the perfect amount of carbonation, tannic and full-bodied. This is exceptionally drinkable and delicious. The 500 ml will not be enough."
"This was my first RR ever and I'm glad I had the chance to get my hands on some. This is quite the tasty brew and definitely one of the best IPAs that I have had. I could drink this all night. I had the Surly Wet a few weeks before I had a shot at this and as far as fresh beers go, that was amazing but this is a great year round wonder."
"Honestly, I could drink this again and again and again, but I do not to ruin the experience. Can't wait to a hold of this one again"
"Drank 6 bottles weekly. 1st bottle was a week old and delicious. By the 4th bottle/week, the hop sweetness/flavor fell off a little, and the bitterness stood out more. Actually liked it more at this stage. By the 6th/week bottle, the bitterness stood out alot, but still retained good hoppiness."
"Bottled on 10/08/10."
"Get it and drink it fresh."
"First Pliny enjoyed at Spinnerstown with Jim and Brian. Had this beer along with Damnation, Consecration and Temptation so I will review again later when I am more focused. But I cant think of an IPA/DIPA or any beer that I've had that I would honestly drink before this one. So balance and frighteningly easy to drink for 8%. Took a growler for the fridge and will definitely seek out in the near future. Thanks again to John, Jim and Brian for the great company."
"Overall, I think this beer is a little over hyped. Given this or Nugget Nectar, I'll take NN. Glad I tried it and I would get seek it out again. Highly recommended to seek out but not the be all end all."
"For an 8% DIPA this beer goes down so easy. It is not my favorite style by any means but now I understand why everyone raves about the Pliny."
"Ahhh, one of the Holy Grails of the beer world. This pours a very clear and sparkling copper. The head laces the glass as the beer is consumed. The aroma is deliciously and divinely hoppy: citrus, grapefruit, cantaloupe, mango, tropical fruit, and a bit of clean and light pine. Every aroma is matched in the flavor. This is a hop head's delight. The finish is bitter. The aftertaste is clean, matching the flavors, all of which linger on the palate. This is the second time I have had Pliny and it is as good as I remember. If you like American hop forward IPA's, this is a classic, excellent and high benchmark example of the style. This beer is so exquisitely tasty, it is hard to believe it is 8% ABV. Bottled on 10-18-10."
"I'm not a huge IPA fan. That being said, this was really enjoyable. One I will go back to if I can get my hands on it."
"D: This is refreshing. Not even a trace of alcohol, this goes down easy, almost too easy at a higher ABV. Still good enough for a pint's worth."
"Wont be my last...special thanks to La Bodega in Riverside for having it."
"D - I only have two but could go all night. Awesome!"
"I was able to try a """fresh""" one and one a few months old during the 9/2010. Enjoyed them both as fine examples of a hop flavor fwd IPA with citrus character. More on the dry side for an IPA, looking fwd to trying one again and taking more detailed notes."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/11/10/tasting-the-russian-river-pliny-the-elder/"
"Overall - I wasn't sure what to expect with all of the hype about this beer. It is without a doubt the best imperial IPA I have had to date. You can really tell that they used very high quality ingredients in this beer. Worth seeking out."
"this definitely did not disappoint, though in the range of bottles Ive had my feelings have been from one of the better DIPAs ever to this is good, and had nothing to do with age. So I have to take something away from it."
"D: Extremely drinkable, if only I had access to it!"
"I expected BIG things from this Ale. TOTALLY OVER RATED!!! One dimensional with no sophistication . Tasted like a pine cone or kitty litter, take your pick, Very short after taste that finished like balsa wood. Can't figure out all the hype??? I tasted this with 2 other Beer Drinkers, and we all felt the same."
"I was fortunate enough to have some Pliny shared with me. This particular beer had been bottled only 28 days before we opened it, so I feel confident it was a fairly accurate representation of how it should taste. This poured a deep golden or copper color with a decently sized white head. Head retention was good and it left a little lacing. Smell was of citrus and fruit in addition to the hoppy smell. I found it interesting that the smell highlighted the citrus but the beer has more of a pine flavor in the taste. Starts out with the citrus and a little bit of pine hop, then hits the little bit of malt in the middle and finishes off with a bitter pine hop. Mouthfeel is good, light/medium body with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't really appreciate Pliny, but I think I get it now. It's been a few months since I tried it last and now, as I sit outside a SoCal bar I appreciate Pliny. It still isn't my most favorite IPA or DIPA but it definitely makes the top 3. This is some dang good beer."
"Overall - I had heard a lot about this beer and I had to find it when visiting CA. I had one on tap at Stone Brewing and was extremely impressed. This review is on the bottled form. This beer is everything expected. The smoothness of the drink, specifically the bitterness and balance with malt, is amazing. It has that extra """something""" that sets it above."
"D-i will never grow old of this. this is my new favorite IPA. the abv doesn't hit quickly either"
"Bye"
"An incredible beer that I could drink all night or at any time for that matter."
"D- Destined to disappear fast. I wouldn't have guessed this was classified as a DIPA. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. The balance leans towards the hops of course, but the taste is just perfectly balanced between the citrus and pine hops. A supremely drinkable, enjoyable and all around awesome beer, although there are other IPAs and DIPAs that may be more interesting flavorwise."
"Drinkability: much better in a bottle than on tap wish I could afford to buy more than one of these"
"Amazing!"
"D- If I could get this every day, I would drink it that often. Its dangerously drinkable, and every sip explodes with hop flavor yet is so balanced as to leave me reaching for another sip soon after I've finished. I need to try this one on tap."
"like it a lot, not the greatest double ive tasted, but it is really all you need"
"That being said, I was a little let down by all the hype. There is another DIPA, which will remain unnamed, that is almost identical in every aspect, and shines a bit more to me than this. PtE, while exceptional, seems to stand out due to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nonetheless, it's a damn good beer!"
"thanks hoser for bringing this one back it is great beer that I'm glad I got to try. not the best DIPA I've ever had but well up near the top of the list, its nice when a beer lives up to all the hype"
"Drinkability: I'm definitely on the band wagon with this one, believe the hype! Light feel and incredibly balanced from start to finish. Impressive offering. Just as good now as it was in August and September."
"D - You never want to stop drinking pliny, because you always want the sweet citrus and pine taste in your mouth. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPAs."
"Overall drinkability and experience stands on it's own, outside of the hype of trying one of the best beers in the country. This one really stands up to all of the hype and allure behind it. I paid four dollars a bottle plus shipping costs, and that was well worth this experience. By far my favorite DIPA, but other versions of the style are more accessible for me and fulfill the hophead cravings. This is a must and it definitely makes me want to do a Santa Rosa pilgrimage in the future."
"Mouthfeel was superb. There was a great resiny, hop-infused aftertaste. Was a very enjoyable first taste of a great DIPA."
"D- Drinkability is astonishingly high for such a high alcohol DIPA. Really benefits from the smooth finish and is addictingly flavorful. The big bottle benefits greatly in this regard. A really fantastic brew and definitely gets me interested in more Russian River beers!"
"D - highly drinkable. just wish it was easier to get."
"This is phenomenal stuff. The best beer I have ever tasted and a yardstick by which to measure all other IPA's. Truly delicious."
"T - Bitter hops right in your face, wow. They don't last long so it isn't over powering. Tastes of some fruit towards the end."
"D: This is my go to pint. One or five, it is the perfect session beer. So much character, so easy to drink."
"It is a great beer but I guess all the hype kinda ruined it for me."
"You've undoubtedly seen and heard all the superlatives about this beer. Thanks to """Mages64""" for sending this along. My bottle was dated as brewed 9/23/10. So at least I got to this within about a month. It truly is an excellent product. The 8% alcohol is very well hidden. I enjoyed my serving in a tulip glass. The beer changes character, for the better, as it warms slightly. It reveals not only piney citrus, but hints of caramel malt. And although the piney-ness is predominant, it's smoooth and silky in the mouth. A terrific compliment to spicy tacos. All I can say is: go get some. Whether you are a fan of IPAs, a """hop head""" or not, you'll like this one."
"/endreviews."
"Drinkability: I could drink this anytime! I love this beer! Love Love Love!"
" Body is full but not super sticky, and definitely lighter than I would expect from an 8% beer. Carbonation keeps the body somewhat creamy, too. Not much heat from the booze, either. Overall, an incredibly drinkable beer that packs a huge punch of hops. Very, very nice."
"Drink- Great beer to me but not an A+. Would be good to try on draft to compare the two."
"Notes-I...did not expect to like this beer as much as I did, I mean, I expected to like it but not be on the verge of literally founding a cult in its name; all hail Pliny!, and much thanks to my friend who through some convoluted means managed to get a bottle of this and was generous enough to part with it."
"Mouthfeel is also spot on with a medium body and plentiful carbonation. I could definitely see myself drinking this on a daily basis if it were easily available."
"Poured into large red wine glass. Copper color with 1/2 finger white head that sticks to the glass. Head fell, left small and bubbly Super aroma dominated by flowery hops with some citrus. Amazing flavor balanced with hops and malt. Spectacular soft carbonation. This has to be the most drinkable double IPA i've tasted. Simply awesome."
"D: What can I say that hasn't been said, excellent beer, also easy to go through quickly!"
"This beer is a clear gold with about a half inch foamy head and bubbles that just keep rising. The smell is very refreshing with apples and maybe pineapple. It makes me think of early summer fruit. The mouthfeel isn't quite what I expected. A bit salty at first. Quite bitter. The taste is overwhelming and takes a little bit to get used to. It's quite flowery and the hops are very noticeable. Not as clean and fruity as I was expecting from the smell. A very nice beer, but I don't think I would drink this regularly."
"Pours Bright golden color. Beautiful to look at. Nice lacing as well. Smells most of hops of course, with a nice pine note. Taste is mostly hops, but well balanced with a pleasant malt flavor. Not as overwhelmingly hoppy as some DIPAs get, but still a bit too hoppy for the casual beer drinker. For us beer nerds however, this beer is pure hop nirvana."
"Well deserving of its A+ rating and a beer I would seek out over and over if I could."
"I easily finished a growler's worth of this stuff over two days. There's just no way anyone can make a better DIPA than this... but that doesn't mean they should stop trying!"
"D- High. If I lived in an area where it was more available, It would be a staple in my refrigerator. Very refreshing. Amazing job RR!"
"Basically, I wanted to see what all the hype was about surrounding this beer. I had my expectations set high, but Pliny certainly met, if not exceeded them. The balance of malts, hops, sweetness, and bitterness is, as far as I have experienced, unmatched. Easily my favorite IPA. If only I lived on the West Coast I would have a fridge full of these..."
"I love this beer."
"Is this the best IPA in the world? Not so sure... Is this one of the best on the west coast, and maybe the country? Certainly."
"I love hops and this one was well worth trying. Great balance of pine, hops, citrus, touch of sweetness and malts to keep it all balanced nicely. I will treat myself again and again to this brew."
"Overall I'm very happy with this one. I've been waiting patiently since I found my love for the hop and Pliny didn't disappoint."
"Had this dozens of times from bottles and on tap, reviewing this one from a very fresh bottle. Pours a clear light orange gold with a soapy white head. Nose is very bright, loads of hops express white grapefruit rind, dank pine forest, and almost a candy-like quality. Balance of flavors is straight up deft here, walks a brilliant line between bright, bitter citrus and a chewy candy sweetness. Luscious and juicy in the mouth. Having this from a bottle at 3 weeks old or so is an awesome experience."
"If only there was a Glad plug-in to go with this beer, cause I would love for my house to smell like this beer."
"D - All day, every day. An incredible beer that deserves its ranking and accolades."
"One of the BAs I tried this one with summed it all up quite nicely: """If there were an eau de toilette with this scent, I'd wear it every day"""."
"So, in short, (although it might be too late for that) if you run across this beer by choice or chance, get it, enjoy it and count yourself lucky. Some of us have to visit 3 or 4 stores daily to get it very seldom, if ever..."
"Obviously, this is an excellent beer that I would never turn down the opportunity to have. That said, are there DIPAs that are equally as good, if not better, that are more readily available to me in Kansas City? Absolutely."
"This is a very good beer, was shocked at the flavor the first time I had it. I got it at a fair price too, the local beer store went out of their way to go pick up a case in California, which was really cool of them. I think they sold the bottles pretty much at cost too. Reviewed from short notes from a tasting."
"I think I'll put this back on my wants now that I've savored this in it's entirety and by it's lonesome."
"This beer really is quite exceptional and really is one of the top beers out there. It is so incredibly refreshing and drinkable, i just really love it and would totally rank it as one of the best beers I've ever had so far. truly phenomenal."
"Drinkability: This beer is absolutely fantastic. I can completely understand the hype around it and hope to have it again someday."
"Thanks to Azurescens for bringing this from Washington (state, obviously) and trading. This next sip is for you!"
"Basically, this is how you do it. Much imitated but never duplicated. One of the great ones."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a orange-ish hint, and a white head. In the aroma, sweet citrus, grapefruit and orange rinds. In the taste, grapefruity to orange citrus hops and a sweet maltiness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry citrus hop aftertaste. Big west coast hops, hides the alcohol, easy drinking and great."
"D - I am glad I was able to get my hands on this. I can see how this is so highly rated. Fantastic DIPA with excellent drinkibility for a DIPA. I wish this had a tad bit more caramel malt to balance out the hop Blitzkrieg."
"Final thoughts: although this is an excellent beer, I expected it to blow me away & it didn't. Its still a wonderful brew."
"Hands down my favorite beer of all time. What else is there to say that everyone else has not put. If you ever have a chance, drink this at the bar and not at home from the bottle. The atmosphere @ the bar and this beer with a thing of drew bites is amazing"
"Quite simply one of the most complex, well-balanced, easiest drinking beers you'll ever enjoy. Its myriad flavors are somehow blended in a way that accessible to even the most novice beer drinker. It's a brew that completely lives up to the hype. If you're ever in NorCal, it's worth a stop in Santa Rosa."
"Pliny is the finest beer in this Style; hands down."
"Each poured a dull amber, almost orange color. It looks a lot like freshly brewed ice tea. It averaged two fingers of foamy white head which stuck to the glass for several sips. The nose is full of hops with a little bit of a pear aroma lingering. It is very smooth, almost like the carbonation is completely missing for a brief period before striking toward the end. It tastes of citrus and tons of bitter hops which stay on the palate for a long long time. Alcohol is perfect and just what I expect from an IPA."
"D= These go down quick for me I really enjoy them this beer really lives up to the hype one of my favorites."
"RR has done an excellent job of making an imperial IPA drink as smooth as a regular IPA. ABV strength is there but not dominating the flavor."
"Re-reviewing this one that I picked up in a trade, bottled on 28 May 14.  Clear yellow-orange pour with a gorgeous two finger meringue-like white head with great retention and lacing.  The nose is huge and citrus dominated along with hints of pine, resiny hops, tangerine, grapefruit, and caramel.  The taste is still incredibly fresh considering it's 3 months old.  Big West Coast citrus notes along with pungent hops, pine, sweet caramel, tangerine, grapefruit, and orange peel.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily with perfect carbonation and a crisp, dry finish.  The balance is amazing and the drinkability is off the charts.  Still living up to the hype..."
"This is the best IPA that I've ever had."
"As one of my friends commented when we opened another bottle from this batch at a tasting a few days later: """the beers we've had are good, but when you taste Pliny you can tell you are drinking a special beer.""" This is another talked about beer that is worthy of the praise it gets."
"D: Yeah, near perfection, dry and great. These guys nail it every batch."
"the hoppiness of the beer is incredible...the balance is unbelievable..nothing is overpowering and you wouldnt think for a second this was a double IPA...only after sucking down 3 in a row did I remember how much the alcohol content was...I cant wait to find more!"
"A great DIPA, I suppose after hearing how great it was for the last four years, it would be nearly impossible for anything to live up to the build up though. All in all, an excellent beer."
"D- My best IPA I ever had and man I try some good ones but with the balance of citrus and hops and even taste the oils. My enamels are coming off. Everybody in the world should try this beer once."
"Reviewed from notes after having had this at Monks a few weeks ago. The color is a light amber/slightly orange with a nice sized head and some moderate lacing. Hoppy and sweet in the nose, the smell is powerful and inviting. the taste leans slight more toward malty with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is incredibly balanced. While the hop presence is strong, it's not as bitter as many hoppy beers are and just goes down smoothly. I love this beer. First time I had it I felt a little underwhelmed from the hype, but the more I drink it and compare it to other DIPAs, I realize it's beauty as the balance is what really makes this beer excellent. Cheers!"
"Conclusion: Pliny the Elder is incredible either as a standalone or paired with food, definitely the best IIPA I've ever had. A beer that exceeds its reputation."
"Extremely well crafted."
"though I wasn't quite wowed on the initial sip like i thought i would be, i quickly make my way through the bottle and am thirsting for another. Its not out of the ordinary or terribly exceptional for the style, it just solid in all aspects. I would love to have this as a regular option here on the east coast. Though its not my """perfect 5""" beer, its one I can see myself seeking out again and again."
"M&D. Nice medium mouthfeel withn ample carbonation, in general I find it to be slightly better on tap than in the bottle. Finishes with a slight oily/resinous coating with some bitterness that makes it hard to savor. If you love hops, you should seek this one out."
"One of the best DIPAs on planet Earth, ever."
"I have looked forward to trying this beer for a long time and I have to say I was very impressed but I was not completely blown away. That might be because of the epic hype surrounding this beer or that I did not get to drink it as fresh as many people recommend. I am not a huge fan of piney hops and I generally prefer a little more malt backbone to balance out the hops but it did start to grow on me after a few drinks of it. With that said, this is a very solid offering from Russian River and its definitely a world class beer in my opinion."
"Overall, this has to be one of the best Imperial IPAs I've tried to date. With so much hype surrounding it and it's nephew, Pliny the Younger (which I've yet to try), I definitely wasn't disappointed."
"Taking the horrible conditions this beer went through I say this is a solid beer that can with stand the elements, but not time. I will revisit this and make sure it is fresher and kept in good condition."
"Drinkeability: One of the best beers I've ever had. I'm glad I had a chance to try this."
"Pours a deep orange colour with thick white head and lacing all over the glass. Smells of strong pine with some citrus hops and caramel malt. Flavour isn't as bitter as some double IPA's, but the balance is just incredible. This is simply the best beer I've ever had and it lives up to my memory. I can't wait to try Pliny the Younger someday."
"Overall: This is a great beer. If you come across it, give it a try. However, I bought into the hype when I first tried this one and was left a little wanting. It is a damn fine IPA, but it won't revolutionize the way you think of beer like some people would want you to believe."
"I have tasted a lot this many years, but this is the exceptional! And so far, I've only had a bottle!It has a fine finish, a lot more ipa, and is more than a bottle, that is, a full pint is FULL. A finer taste, 2 beers is all that can drink at a time.Eight percent is fine and can only handle 2 bottles a sitting."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer but I was a little disappointed based on the extreme hype surrounded by it. I would love to try it fresh on tap, or even a 'fresher' bottle (hard to believe 1 month old isn't fresh). I would hope that a beer could still be enjoyed ~1 month from bottling, but if that's not the case, and Pliny needs to be drank <1 week old, I'll most likely pass on actively trying to seek this out on the east coast."
"D- honestly i think i enjoy sculpin and two hearted more than PTE; maybe that's sacrilege to say that but that's how i felt; i think availability and hype are huge factors in the scoring of this beer; a beer that """must be enjoyed""" two weeks after bottling and no more because you will lose the whole appeal of the beer doesn't really translate to a great or superior beer imo; definitely really nice to try but i was a bit let down after enjoying Sculpin and getting the impression that this would be the beer of the Gods"
"D: I can't belive how smooth and clean this beer is! It leaves the the palet so refreshed! I could drink this beer all day!"
"Bottled 19 days ago."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a great year-round DIPA that goes down very easy. I can see why this is so popular. There are also some very good local options like Abrasive Ale, HopSlam, and Illumination that will keep me plenty satisfied for my fix though. Would I like to drink more? Hell ya! Would really like to try this on tap at the brewery someday."
"Overall, the hand down best IPA I've ever had. Great combination of hop flavors and crispness. So refreshing its dangerous. Absolutely my highest recommendation. The only hard thing about this review was deciding whether this was a perfect 5 or not. A truly sublime IPA."
"D- Drinkabillity is pretty good because the alcohol is well hidden, but the hops become rather overpowering after a few and you cannot taste anything else."
"Drinkability -- One would expect an IIPA with such a cult following to be intense to the nth degree, but what you have with Pliny The Elder is an incredible flavor profile that is perfectly balanced and incredibly easy to drink. I offered this growler up for my best friend's birthday party, but I could have just as easily drank this all by myself. If I lived in CA, this would be in my fridge at all times. A nearly flawless beer."
"I really enjoy Pliny, as I've had it more than a few times before finally sitting down to review it. It's awesome with a big, greasy bacon cheeseburger! I don't think it's that great standing on it's own though.."
"For being an IPA this is a real nice beer and I do respect it for advancing the style but IMHO there are other beers I would rather drink such as 2XIPA or hopslam. Personally I enjoy east coast IPA's (And Great lakes region) just more than west coast. Nonetheless I would drink a Pliny again in a heartbeat."
"This beer lives up to the hype in nearly every way. No one will be disappointed."
"D-While not exactly a session beer, I could drink this all day with no regrets. This is the best beer I ever had!"
"Fantastic beer, just as I expected it to be. I am quite an explorer when it comes to hoppy beers though, and there are still quite a few IIPA's that sit above this one on my list of favorites."
"Notes: I was dying to try this for a long time. While it's not my favorite ipa, it's probably the most impressive one. Delicious and every hopheads dream!"
"Do I think it's the #2 beer in the world? no, there are plenty of beers I'd rather have in my favorite styles. But I give this high marks when rating to style, as it is the best DIPA I've had."
"D - Goes down clean and smooth, the tingle from the obnoxious amount of hops makes it one step from being able to be funneled. Wish I could pick this up in my area."
"An incredibly good DIPA. On tap at Father's Office. Pours with a large, thick, off-white head covering a slightly cloudy orangy body. Lace ring per sip! Aroma is quite nice blend of toffee, some spice and lots of pine, citrus, and grapefruit. Taste is very piney, with some spicy hops and a nice sweetness backing it all up. Great aftertaste and the alcohol strength in the taste is quite nice as well. Lightly bubbly with a nice body to back up the hops. This is the quintessential IIPA!"
"D - Drinkablity is off the charts. Just keeps you wanting more. The balance between the hops and malt, malt and hops is perfection in a bottle."
"D - Very drinkable for a DIPA, then again this is as light of a DIPA that I have tasted. Very good beer, I'd drink it on many occasions if I had access to it. Not gonna lie though, this one did not live up to expectations for me. I like it, it was a very solid brew, but no A+ in my book."
"Drinkability? Well of course. with the exception of water...this is the easiest thing to drink."
"D- I love it. I love this beer. Like they say, I could live off this...Can I live off this? Serious question. Because I'll do it."
"medium bodied, moderately carbed. pretty damn drinkable, too. one of the greats, i'll give it that; i gotta say, though, call me crazy but for my money dfh's 90 matches up pretty well."
"Rumor was that since folks were selling growlers of Pliny the Younger on Ebay (limited release), there will be strict limits next year. Stick with The Elder- it's worthy."
"D - Pretty drinkable really. Surprisingly balanced for the hop content."
"I'd put this up there with my two favorite IPAs right now - Ballast Point Sculpin IPA and Alpine Beer Co's Duet."
"This was a great beer. I will be drinking a lot more of this goodness asap."
"Paired this with one a pesto, feta and garlic pizza. The match up was good, the beer scrubbing away the garlic and cheese, soothed the salty feta. However I will say the beer was more interesting."
"Russian River Brewing Company--Pliny The Elder--2008 16.9 oz. Bottle. 8.00% ABV. 80 IBU's? (4.75+ / 5.0) IPA--Imperial. No sediment. Lacy foamy rich head. Cloudy bright lemon orange gold fizzy color. Huge floral grapefruit pine hop ester front. Crisp mild sweet hop oil pale malt grassy grapefruit body. Easy balanced hop spice pine citrus end. WOW!! Floral hop infused crisp IPA. Sampled 1/6/2009. 4 @ $4.99 Each."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice white head with low carbonation. The aroma is of citrus and piney hops. The color is a deep golden with no haze. The taste is the piney hops up front and a sweet malty backbone. The body is a touch heavy, but not overpowering. It's a nice example of a west coast big IPA or DIPA."
"D (4.0)- Tasty and enjoyable. The beer really takes some time to open up as it warms. Not even close to Hopslam in my book, but for a year round west coast beer, this is worth trying."
"Overall this is a BIG beer that is definitely for hop-lovers, though it remains drinkable and balanced with a surprisingly aromatic quality. I drink it every chance I get."
"The mouthfeel is so smooth, medium bodied with the exact perfect amount of carbonation. Finishes dry and leaves a wonderful aftertaste of hops to savor. This is incredibly drinkable for a DIPA. It goes down perfectly, and every sip makes me wish I had better access to this beer!"
"Drank on 8/29/10 with bottled date of 8/11/10. Thanks to Loki83 for the fresh, tasty extra!"
"D - Two of these and its over. I want more, but I know it would be a bad idea. None of the flavors however are off-putting, leaving the palate ready for more."
"Man, I love living in California"
"Overall - Pliny certainly deserves the hype that it gets. While I'm still not sure if it's my #1 IPA, it is without a doubt one of the best. Do not hesitate to try this one if you like your hops and see it!"
"This is scary drinkable . I would love to be able to get this more often."
"D: perfect. I would drink this every day if given the opportunity. probably the freshest tasting beer I've ever had. nothing in particular stands out and that's the beauty of it, it's beer in perfect harmony. refined and subtle."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and the alcohol is low enough to make this sessionable. It is just a joy to drink this beer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is perfect with the best amount of hoppy aftertaste. This is a beer I could drink exclusively until the end of time. An absolutely wonderful beer IIPA!"
"Excellent drinkability. It's gone all too soon; much like RCA Selectavision, pogs, Berry Berry Kix, Audioslave & my '88 Ford Taurus Wagon. Ah, to live within Russian River's distribution network. Y'all are lucky indeed."
"The drinkability on this is unreal. I finished my first pint on tap in about five minutes. It is so good that you don't even realize how high the ABV is. I took much more time with the bottle serving though since that is the one I reviewed."
"After the euphoria passed I ordered another hoping that the tap wouldn't blow before I got a glass. It didn't and the beer was just as good as I remember, if not better. The beer looked delicious and poured a nice thick head. The taste and smell were nice and hoppy but not overpowering with a mild sweetness. I had a great time at this little place and recommend it to anyone who is around the Pacific City or """Cloverdale""" area in Oregon."
"Drinkability - You can session this one, but I'd plan on not driving anywhere afterwards"
"Overall this is one of the best DIPAs around. A must-have world class example of the style."
"As a deep-rooted east coast treestump, I tried and failed to be cool when I saw PTE (for only $5!) in the first San Francisco bar I visited on a recent California beer pilgrimage. When the publican reached for the tap handle and I realized that this legendary brew would actually be mine, I quivered like a tweenybopper stricken with Bieber Fever. I accepted a cool pint glass of honey-colored ale, yellower than the average IPA, a little hazy with a stiff inch of foam on top. A deep whiff: stonefruit, flowers, something faintly pungent that isn't quite spice. Very complex. Huge intensity from the first sip. More of the peachy fruit character, lavender, pine needles, a peep of acidity on the midpalate. Strong taste of alcohol on the finish tangles the flavor tapestry just a little, but what else do you expect from a mega-brew like this? Lovely texture--I had downed three by the time I returned to """Earth""". The hype is real, the volume is eleven. Truly the """Back in Black""" of beers."
"Pliny is as close to beer heaven as I've been."
"Great smooth mouthfeel very easy to drink and very enjoyable, probably one of my favorite DIPA's."
"D: Out of the park! At 8% abv, this DIPA has no heat whatsoever to it, just pure hoppy delicious-ness!! This one clearly lives up to the hype!"
"Overall, I now realize how spoiled I am. A good beer, but not as good as a fresh 'slam."
"D - Every sip is as exceptional as the first. Cherish this beer if you can get your hands on it!"
"Notes: Was this everything I wanted and more? No, but it fell only barely short of the mark."
"Easy to drink like a standard IPA, body was light, too. This is such a dangerously drinkable beer, that if I had access to it, it would be easy to drink pints & pints of it. One of the best brewed beers I've ever drunk."
"Drinkability would be higher if it was more balanced, but an American IIPA is going to be heavily hopped. This is an excellent example of the style."
"D: For 8%? Absolutely. Alcohol is almost completely masked here."
"M/D - Perfect level of carbonation. Slightly bitter and dry on the finish but not at all unpleasant. Amazing flavor profile keeps you coming back for more and more. I would drink this every day if I could. As of right now, this is hands down the best DIPA I have ever had."
"Poured a beautiful copper-orange into Tulip. Aroma hits hard... difficult to put down before a taste. Light creamy head off the pour that dissipates slowly. A light twirl regenerates the head easily. Limited lacing. Explosion of flavor and hops on first sip. Very rich and heavy mouthfeel. Hops are so abundant that it's hard to decipher the other flavors. Aftertaste of hops lingers for much longer than normal. This offering has a quality to it that is rare."
"Notes: i liked the 2 month bottle the best. it mellowed some and while its not fresh as it should be, I could enjoy it more at that stage, but then again i prefer balanced beers."
"D: One is plenty as my palate is steering away from the more hoppy brews."
"D - I drink these often, especially if I find the bottles labeled from only a week or two ago. I do get a gnarly headache if I just have a glass of them though, possibly just dehydrates me easily."
"D - This one would get a 5 for drink if I could get it on a regular basis, but it just doesn't come to this right coast. Bottle date is 071410, which is just under a month out. As it warms a bit, almost becomes chewy. Chill it to about 40, and taste the change as it gets to 55, if you can let it sit that long. I can image how good this must be fresh from a keg."
"had at TND's this past weekend on a beer haul. pours a copper yellow transparent color with good off white head, good lacing, and soft carbonation. strong fruity piney smell whiched followed through into the taste. soft bitter piney taste with grapfruit hints, and some caramel malt hints as well. light grassy bitter finish. thin texture and long flavor duration. smooth and crisp. IMO this beer was very good but in no way lived up to the hype. i was expecting much better and was slightly let down. still a very good beer just a little over hyped."
"While I'm not a consistent IPA drinker, PtE is definitely one of my favorite imperial IPA and have had several since my first. Any fan of hops should make an effort to try it fresh at least once."
"This beer is amazing. Anyone that likes beer will like this beer. The grapefruit smell/taste makes this beer exceptional!"
"I had the opportunity to drink this on 8-7-10 with a friend of mine. What can I possibly say that has not already been said about this beer before. This truly is liquid pakalolo;) The smell and taste was bitter, hoppy, and had a piney resin taste that truly reminded me of the """happy weed"""! One of the best beers I have had and will be looking forward to drinking more of this!"
"Accommodating this much hoppiness requires a master's touch and RR walked the tightrope on this one beautifully."
"Typically, I've been disappointed by beer hyped on BA. It seems that nothing I taste comes close to the gushing reviews but Pliny the Elder is different. It truly equals the hype. A truly delicious beer and it was such a pleasure to drink."
"All in all, a total hop assault - but without being offensive. The malt backbone appropriately compliments the hop showcase. Never had a DIPA quite like it - the hype is justified."
"Bottled 7/14/10. Smell has lots going on resin, pine caramel, orange and grapefruit are all present and intermingle with each other nicely. Taste has pine and grapefruit dominating with a very light almost charcoal character to it as the bitterness makes its presence known towards the end. It's almost too bitter for me at the end, which is really the only thing wrong with it. Mouthfeel is slighty sticky and oily but overall is light but viscous. Alcohol isn't really noticeable at all making this easy to drink."
"D: The most drinkable 8% or higher beer I have ever had; so drinkable and delicious"
"Would love to have one of these beauts with a meaty and greasy pizza..."
"Pours a light orange with a pearl white head. Good retention and the lacing is unbelievable. Great looking DIPA. Strong floral and citrus hop aroma, very enjoyable. This one is for hop lovers. Floral, citrus (predominately grapefruit) strong hop flavor off the bat. Followed by a strong pine and spicy hop. All the hops are incredibly balanced and showcased. A bready, semi-sweet malt shines through near completion before finishing with another kick of strong pine hops. Awesome job balancing the big flavors."
"There's no question this ale lives up to the hype. I've been drinking PtE for some time and it's evolved into its own, trademarked """Pliny Flavor""" on my palate, so I really had to sit down and notice the nuances, which are many. One of the most striking things about this brew is, as mentioned, the perfect harmony of bitter and sweet. Truly one of the most balanced ales in existence, and a brew that beer geeks and novices alike will find delicious, even on the first sip. One of the best beers on the planet and the standard-bearer for DIPA."
"My New Years resolution for 2010 was to drink as many different beers as I could possibly find. So Far so good. I have had 597 different beers from January 1st at noon until today July 30th and Pliny The Elder is by far my favorite. A friend in California has managed to get me not 1 but 2 of these to Massachusetts (thanks Sue!) and I can honestly say that this beer makes me want to move to California. The Aroma will hit your nose from two feet away as soon as you pop the cap. Grapefruity and inviting. If you have ever eaten something so delicious that you find yourself craving it weeks later...well....you know where I'm going. I have read reviews knocking this hoppy delight and reviews praising it. My opinion after almost 600 different beers in 7 months is...get one ...drink one....it really is an outstanding beer. There's Filet Mignon...There's Dom Perignon...and looking down on both of them is Pliny The Elder."
"D: Excellent. This would be a great beer to have with dinner and goes down smooth and easy. Not a top 10 beer in my opinion, but very good, and a must try."
"D - Very drinkable. I split this with glazeman, but easily could have downed a bottle or two on my own. Smooth, crisp, and no EtOH burn. I wish this one was closer to home - thank God for beer shipments from the west coast..."
"D- goes down sooo smooth. Amazing beer"
"Big big respect to Spdkilz (Carleton) for being such a great BA!! Pliny bottled on 07/05/10. I'd say this pours honey orange with a great poofy white head that sticks around for a while. After that head fades it leaves a fare amount of lacing around the sides of my Duvel tulip glass. The hop aroma coming off of this beer is something I've never experianced. It is like I am sticking my head in the hop fridge at my home brew supply store. 1st resinous piny hops, then citrus and grapefruit huge aroma. The taste is a hop assault. The malt profile is just so that it allows the hops to shine. Bitter, citrusy, fruity and sprucy/piny and oh so good. I think this is the 1st beer I've given 2 5.0 ratings too. The mouthfeel is what I would expect from an ipa. Yes folks pliny is great, but whether I could drink more then 2 of these guys is another story so a little lower score for drinkability. Man this is some great beer."
"bottled on 6.30.10, drink mid-july."
"D - Amazing drinkability, this bottle disappeared quickly. There's a reason there's so much hype for this beer, it's easily one of the best DIPAs on the planet. Wish it was easier to get in Georgia."
"D - A must for any IPA drinker, drink one or two and you will see what I am talking about. Enjoy and be glad."
"D - Ya this is damn good stuff but most people already know that already. Pliny is just delicious, plain and simple. Drink one NOW!"
"D: I'm on course to finish a full growler myself. When it's on tap I always get it. I can't really name a beer I would drink more. It merits a 5.0 here."
"Pairing Score: A. IPA's pair well with cheese.. No surprise."
"Very good beer that I'll always enjoy drinking. Nothing far-fetched or enticingly creative, but a quality beer on all fronts."
"Drinkability: Quite possibly the most drinkable IIPA/Double IPA I've ever had. Will definitely have it again."
"D: In drinkability, this beer lives up to the hype. It's a supremely well balanced example of taste meets alcohol meets down-the-hatch."
"This is my favorite beer. Smell says """drink me.""" Hops are strong -- strong, strong, strong -- but without any harshness. This is a real trick and Russian River pulls it off. Flavors are complex and balanced. Carbonation is perfect. I only wish Russian River had better distribution so more people could taste this beer (and so it was more available to me.)"
"I love it."
"A beer that lives up to its perennial hype, Pliny is deserving of its position amongst the upper echelon of American DIPAs. With its big hop presence, artfully balanced flavors and refreshing drinkability, this is one Elder that's virtually impossible to disrespect."
"Drinkability - I think I would have this thing on tap at my house at all times. 5.0/5.0"
"Overall PTE is a very drinkable beer. IMO though, Hopslam can stand toe to toe with this big boy. I'd like to thank tlay10 for hooking me up with not one, but two bottles to enjoy."
"Dark golden with a nice 1/4""" head of pure white foam. Aromas are intense. Floral, citrus, spice, grapefruit , pine , and more. HOPS! and some biscuity malts and some weed-like aromas as well. The taste is hoppy and bitter with a very deep flavor complexity within the confines of the citrus, flower, and other hop induced flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is up there. A killer DIPA. I like this brew very much."
"d-epic. should i just move to california today or tell people i'm leaving first? delicious. ambrosia."
"D: Magnigicently hoppy. YUM!"
"This beer never gets old to me."
"MF/D: sizzle of carbonation that quickly dissipates for a smooth swallow. my favorite IPA! yum!"
"Cheers."
"It's times like this I wish I didn't live in NYC."
"At first I thought this could go toe to toe with some other DIPAs I've had, but this one stands out, due to the extreme hop presence, and excellent flavor of the beer. Crisp and clean and perfectly balanced. The hops don't stop, and the finish is unbelievable. I don't think another beer could duplicate this if they tried. Not too thick and syrupy either. perfect combo....well done, lived up to the hype, which is hard to do!"
"O - Exceptional DIPA - Flowery balance complements the hop feel almost perfectly."
"O - Up to this point, I can't think of an IPA or DIPA that I enjoy nearly as much as this one, and really only one other beer in general. I'm lucky to live where I do, in that I can have this pretty much any time with a short drive. And I no doubt need to take advantage of that more often."
"D - As sophisticated a DIPA I've ever encountered... Not the hoppiest... Not the most well balanced... But this one has a certain undeniable aura of greatness..."
"As a double IPA, it is most certainly a pleasant experience but not my favorite one. Bias and hype may have raised my hopes too much for this beer, but that does not mean it didn't come close to meeting some of them."
"Drinkability: This beer keeps getting better and better. There was absolutely no way it could have met my expectations, but it came pretty close. It would be a treat to have this available more often."
"After drinking my half (I shared with a friend), I now can appreciate this beer as the 6th best in the world. It was amazing!!!"
"I can see the attraction, almost obsession that this beer creates - it is well deserved. The man at the store I picked up the beer at (do I dare say where?) said that they can't order near as much as they would like to - the demand far outweighs the supply Russian River can turn out. Hopefully soon that won't be a problem, but in the meantime, I will continue the search for this Holy Grail of IPA's."
"Where can I get more of this?!?!"
"O: Worthy of the hype. A special DIPA and a special beer period."
"Even if you don't take price into consideration, this is a stupendously good beer. For $4, it probably can't be beat."
"D- obviously a beer of this intensity and ABV wasn't formulated with """drinkability""" too much in mind. however, everything works together so well to create an invigorating brew."
"Pliny's intensity nearly commands a new classification for beers. It's so well crafted that the incredible amount of hops used don't contribute unduly to its bitterness. The citrusy, evergreen, even piney of pliny balance the bitterness and malt to create a truly amazing beer."
"My second Pliny, but first review thereof. It pours a hazy, golden amber-straw, topped by a quickly-dying finger of white froth. The nose comprises a hella-ton o' pine, along with some grapefruit, orange peel, maple sap, and a tiny bit o' caramel in the back, trying to maintain some semblence of a malty backbone. It's got me convinced it's hoppy... The taste follows very similarly, though the two DIPA elements are both sharpened for battle: The hops are especially fruity and flowery, while the malts (caramel and toffee, natch) are stronger, more up to the task of balancing out the hops. I gotta say, the hype has been dead on: this is the most balanced DIPA I've had in a long time. And quite tasty, too. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Yup, this old Roman naturalist lives up to the hype. Get some!"
"D: great. If you can hang with the bitterness of IPA's this is among the top."
"If I could get these more readily, I would drink them much more often, because it is by far my favorite IPA. I haven't had Pliny the Younger, but I can't see any way to improve on this beer. It just seems to be the perfect IPA."
"I've been looking forward to finally cracking open a Pliny, and this was a real treat. Really runs the gamut on flavors and evolves a lot as it warms. Excellent stuff."
"Poured from a week old bottle. Appearence is light amber / golden color, with an off white head that hangs out a bit. Great lacing all the way down the glass. Flavors are a great balance of ever so slight bitter hops and sweet malt flavor. Tasted sweet honey, grapefruit, creamy butter, and slight tang of orange peel. On the palate it is medium bodied beer with a great balance of dry and refreshing finish. Overall one of the best beers I have had to date. Perfect beer for any morning, afternoon, or night!!!"
"Have had Pliny the Elder a couple times at The Beveridge Place Pub in West Seattle. Great pub. Both times I had Pliny it was just about the perfect beer. I could not get enough. It was so well made with layers of flavor and hops from start to lingering finish."
"D- Still one of my favorites but obviously the increase in production has caused a slight slip in overall quality."
"It is a very decent beer, but not sure if it lived up to all the hype. I went into this one thinking I was going to taste the amazing beer ever and that just was not the case. It is definitely toward the top for it's style but not the best."
"Poured this into a pint glass. Pours golden orange with about two fingers of fluffy white head. Nice lacing on this. Lots of piney hops in the nose and bit of citrus zest lingers. The hops tell me this is going to be a hop monster. I can't wait. This is a really juicy DIPA. A big hop flavor and citrus juiciness coats the tongue. Nice carbonation on this and the juicy flavor makes this feel great in the mouth. At eight percent, this DIPA is easy to enjoy."
"I'm no hophead, but this is definitely a wonderful beer."
"If your near Sac, Taylor's Market has them in a limited supply. You have to ask for them, so get them if you can."
"This is a very nice DIPA! Do I think it deserves its 'legendary' status?? I'm not sure."
"D: This bottle just disappeared."
"D- its an ipa so you can't have too many. One 500ml bottle seems like quite enough. I really enjoy this beer every time I drink it and it is one of the pinnacles of the style"
"There is a reason this beer is one of the most sought after on BA. One of the few beers that actually lived up to the hype. I would love to try this beer on tap."
"D - I wouldn't pick this out as an 8% is I didn't read it on the label; very well hidden. For having so much going on this is very easy to drink, and enjoy!"
"IMO, a perfect beer."
"On Tap at Capones. Of course you follow up the Younger with the Elder. A very tasty brew. Has a lot of characteristics that you find in 90 minute. Complex double IPA but the sweet and bitter are very well balanced. Is less creamy than the younger, giving you that nice harsh hop bitterness that double IPA fans presumably enjoy. Elder has a nice clean dry finish. I would say this and 90 minute are my favorite double IPA's."
"D-alcohol is absolutely masked. Drinks like an IPA with 5% alcohol. The best."
"Drinkability: This is true hop head nirvana. There are more hops than you know what to do with and the perfect balance makes you yearn for more. One of the beers that proves how good beer really can be."
"D - again with low abv it's so hard to believe this stuff is 8%. much thanx to smutty 33 for getting this a few times as we're in CT and you can't get it out here.. that makes me very sad... lol.. excellent beer.. i'm with the other million people that have reviewed this and said A+.."
"Drinkability is excellent. I wish I had case. Alcohol is very well-concealed. Very tasty."
"Drinkablility: Scary how easy this goes down. it is intense but for what its worth, its perfect in this category because its got the structure to hold up its huge hop profile. Great with pretty much any course, and excellent with cheddar i bet. This was my first bottle of this stuff and hopefully its not my last."
"I was all ready to think this beer was just an overblown hop head beer. It really is a hop lovers dream come true but the balance of hop characteristics is quite unbelievable. I will say that no beer is worth being obsessed about as much as it seems a lot of prople are but certainly a great beer that has to be tried to be believed. I'm glad I finally got the opportunity."
"D: I'll admit to being biased. I have long considered PtE to be one of the best beers in teh world and if stock on a desert island, this would be my choice. Simply a great smooth, easy drinking hop-bomb that brings out the best of the Simcoe variety."
"Is this 8 percent? You could've fooled me. We plowed through 3 half liters like it was nobody's business and wanted more. The appropriate carbonation helps this go down oh so smooth. I will be looking for this next time it comes to Portland and recommend anybody who sees this available to buy a bottle or three! They can be hard to find so don't pass them up!"
"This is indeed an outstanding beer. Frankly, if I wanted to show someone that the States makes good beer in its own styles, this would probably be the first thing I'd hand them."
"Glad to crack a beer of this caliber for my 50th review, and cheers to psiweaver for the May 12th 2010 bottle. The beer pours a burnt orange in my Duvel tulip, with a frothy, 3 finger off white head quickly forming and lingering. The lacing is decent, but just a bit short of earning a 5 for appearance. A pungent hop aroma is present even as I pour, and grapefruit, pineapple, and bitter orange peels are appreciable. Each sip leads off with the briefest of flashes of bready and caramel malt sweetness, before a shotgun blast of hop bitterness asserts itself. This fades into a more citrus hop flavor, largely pineapple and grapefruit. If the hop bitterness vs flavor balance was tipped a little bit more towards flavor Pliny would get a 5, but it's not quite there. Carbonation is high, but to good effect as it helps highlight all the juicy hop goodness, and I'm surprised at how creamy the mouthfeel is given the relative lack of malt presence. I wouldn't expect to notice much alcohol at 8%, but I don't find any at all as I sip on Pliny, and it's so damn tasty that it's a struggle to stop and savor this despite the bitterness. Truly world class, and the template against which all DIPAs should be measured."
"D- If there weren't so may other awesome beers to sample at this Philly Beer Week event, I'd have been drinking this all night. Can't wait until the next time it taps nearby."
"i'm not schooled to the DIPA, but i'm bettin' they're not all this dam good."
"Extra special thanks to whitebricke for supplying me with this! It's travelled very far, and we hit a couple hiccups on the way but he was right; it was WELL WORTH IT!! This definately is a world class brew and I'm so glad I got to try this. Thanks Ted!"
"This was bought at Capone's in Norristown, PA. I got this awesome IPA on tap and it filled my palette with a long-lasting, yet appealing hoppy-ness. I found the smell to be strong and it enhanced the taste as I enjoyed this beer. It is certainly one that I will enjoy again."
"D- Surely a palate killer as this one attacks the mouth pretty well, but still remarkably easy to drink the entire bottle."
"D - I love this beer and it's flavor and potency but it's just a little bit bitter for me to put down more than one of."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: A very potent but also very drinkable brew. I figure at a few weeks after bottle-date, I'm drinking it about as fresh as I ever will in Michigan. And as such, I was a little surprised to find that it is not the most outrageously hoppy or powerful Imperial IPA I've had. But that doesn't detract from the beer itself. I do think it lives up to its infamy and am very glad I was able to come by a bottle, especially such a fresh one. If they were available in my area, I'd probably buy them often, but as it ends up costing me nearly $30 to get a bottle of this in my hands, I'll probably stick with just the one for now."
"I had a third pliny in august 2011. To be honest the pliny was not as good as the Elliot brew from the Struise brouwers. Too bitter...."
"(Okay, I'm done. In all seriousness, this was an amazing beer that truly lived up to the hype. I am so glad I got to try this fresh.)"
"M/D- full bodied, smooth as hell. great beer and easy drinkin for the ABV on this one. not much to complain about here. i look forward to gettin my hands on some more of this one."
"D- I really could drink this stuff all night. It goes down way too easily."
"Drink: Great price, great beer. It's a big beer but won't knock you down. I could sip on a few of these often enough. It's just a bummer that I have to cross town to get it."
"Pour is light amber-copper with small white ringed hear around edge of glass. Aroma is spruce, resin, pine, citrus, orange rind, and green hops. Flavor has a sharp hop bite with forest green flavors and citrusy rinds. Pretty clean finish and dry on the palate. Drinkability is dangerously high and extremely food friendly. Dear Vinnie, please expand distribution to the great old Midwest."
"A little bit fruit and some pine-yness - just your typical west coast IIPA nose. Bottled on 5/12 this is about as fresh as I could get. The hops hit you up front with freshness but the malt nicely balances out in the end. Just a really smooth drinking beer with incredible balance considering the hop bill on it."
"This is my favorite beer and I consider myself lucky to have it within a 5 minute walk of my house. I never drink more than one in a night and rarely more than one a week. The day I get bored of this beer will be a sad one indeed."
"Tastes great. Awesome balance between the citrus and pine like flavors. The citrus has elements of grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest. Starts out with the sweetness of fruit and the bitterness flares up briefly in the finish. Doesn't feel too carbonated or too syrupy, huge fan and wish that RR distributed to MI (really enjoyed the other couple of beers I had from them). Wouldn't mind having a couple of these in a night."
"D: this is a world class DIPA and I am thrilled to have finally tried it, and super fresh as well. This certainly rivals Abrasive with my favorite DIPA around."
"Comments: An outstanding beer overall! This is my first Pliny, so this review is probably a bit premature, as multiple tastings are needed to properly gauge its complexity."
"Picked up this gem at the super liquor mart in Littleton CO. Poured a golden yellowish sunburst orange hue with a fast diminishing two finger head with some lacing that lasted thru to the end. Aromas of piney hops, citrus, an a touch of honey. Had an grapefruit orange rind touch of sweet malt taste with a dry finish. Light medium body with the right amount of carbonation. Oh yeah! Will drink this little darlin again."
"This beer truly lives up to it's legend. You don't drink it, you experience it!"
"D: I really appreciate this beer the more I drink it. I can't say enough good things about but I'm glad that I have access to it on a daily basis. I've had it on tap and in bottle but you can't beat a fresh pliny out of the bottle."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a slightly hazy, coppery, golden color. Small but thick white head that recedes quickly and leaves lots of lacing behind. Nose is hugely hoppy, mostly citrus hops. Taste follows the nose with tons of hops. That hop bitterness is off the charts but in a good way, not like some other double IPAs that just fry the palate. Despite the abundance of hop flavor and bitterness there is a distinctly malty note towards the finish. The high abv is well hidden, although as it warms some alcohol notes find their way through. Drinkability is great too, could drink these all day were it not for the high abv. This is a GREAT beer but I think I got a little swept away in all the hype as I felt a bit disappointed. Maybe I'll see if I can get a fresher bottle next time around but I doubt much could have possible been lost in a little over a month. A thoroughly excellent beer but not the epic IPA I was expecting."
"Drinkability: This is definitely an all-day kind of beer. I don't care if it's 8% or not, I would glady drink this one as much as possible as it's so damn refreshing and flavorful."
"It has been a while since I have had a fresh, quality IPA/DIPA. It is so easy to throw hops into a beer, but crafting an excellent IPA is a completely different thing. Delicious."
"i really wanted to not like this beer based on the hype but it's a prototypical double ipa."
"Snap up a bottle whenever I see it; have to pace myself as it's so easy-drinking."
"As far as Double IPAs goes, it doesn't get much better than this. Easy to drink is an understatement for this one."
"It's no secret that there's a lot of hype surrounding this brew, but also no surprise once you've had it. Just a great beer. Simple as that."
"Drinkability: Why can't this beer be in TX?!?!! So good. TABC, I will be waiting for this one."
"Despite being 8% abv and full of hops, this is no sipper, it drinks like a session beer. I can see why it is so loved. Big thanks to Rod for bringing home this bottle."
"D - very drinkable, love and will have again. An AMAZING DIPA, not the best, but quite good. I still prefer to drink Founders Double Trouble, but glad I have tried, and will seek this beer out again!"
"overall- I would say this is by far the best double IPA I have had, it has so much hop flavor and aroma, yet is drinkable, I have had alot of double IPas that leave me reaching for water to try to cleanse the palate, not with Pliny. As an east coaster I am blown away, I live next door to Dogfish Head, so I love hoppy beer, but this one is like 90 through 2 or 3 randells. Thanks Vinnie!"
"This was not what I was expecting. The hop/malt balance is good, but the hop flavors just didn't appeal to me. The bitterness wasn't pleasant and the flavor was very one-dimensional. I'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt and try to seek out another bottle based on others' reviews."
"Pours to thick white head and lace, hazy orange-yellow color. Aroma is piney, citrusy and a little sweet malt thrown in. Flavor is piney, resiny and crisp with enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is light-medium with alcohol warmth. Overall very good but not living up to its hype."
"I don't know about it being in the top ten, but this is definitely one of the best IPA's I've had. I think I liked Blind Pig a little better though."
"D: Very smooth and refreshing -- 8% ABV is well hidden. Going to need to round up some more Southern Tier to ship to CA -- I can get used to drinking this. It's not overpowering like a Hopslam or Nugget Nectar -- but rather crisp and smooth."
"Overall: An amazing example of a double IPA. I wish more were shipped to Colorado!! One of my favorites."
"Tasted from 500mL bottle, bottled on 3/26/10. Pours a beautiful amber orange with a long lasting white head. Nose is somewhat floral with honeysuckle, pine aroma, caramel malt, grapefruit hops. The flavors are very clean and balanced. There is nice grapefruit, pine resin, caramel malt, and a bitter hops finish. The palate is nearly perfect. Just enough coating with medium carbonation and a long, but very pleasant bitter finish. Overall, this is an excellent IIPA. Perhaps the best word to describe it is clean, and I will gladly drink this whenever I can get some fresh."
"Summary: Deservedly at the top of every WANT list. Has the hop bitterness that can be enjoyed again and again...assuming you have the resources to trade or fly to sunny CA! RR - Send me a ticket!"
"i am sold, fresh pliny from the bottle is no joke!"
"Overall I do believe I've found my new favorite DIPA. I can't even imagine what it would be like to be able to stroll into my local beer shop and find this on the shelves. If I could do that I'd certainly pick up a couple bottles on every trip. I'm always skeptical about these hyped beers, but this one has earned every bit of it's spot in the Top 10."
"This was the first PTE I've ever tried, and it lived up to everything that I'd heard about it! Gotta thank my friend Adam in Cali for sending a couple my way for my birthday!"
"This may be my favorite beer of all time. I first had it at a brewfest years ago and nothing has really ever compared. I found a liquor store right down the street that carries the 16.9oz bottles and I couldn't be more excited. Russian River's distributors do a wonderful job of ensuring the freshest possible product makes it to their customers and in the case of Pliny the Elder is makes a world of difference. This bottle is dated at 4/5/10 and was poured into a tulip glass. The color is a cloudy golden amber, reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. A rich foamy head arises and it retained with fine lacing. The smell is gloriously fresh and floral hops with enough of a citrus-like honey sweetness to again remind me somewhat of a tripel. The wonderfully bitter hops on the palate are balanced with an interestingly subtle malt that gives the taste an orange peel quality to it. The fresh and resiny hops linger through the finish so much so that its almost like I've been chewing on a mouthful of them. The carbonation is spot on, giving it exceptional mouthfeel and allowing the full and glorious flavor of the beer to be spread broadly across the palate. Everything combines to make this a beer that beckons to be sipped deeply and savored. I really tried to think of a way this beer might be made better and the only thing I could come up with was if it was on tap fresh at the brewery. I may be somewhat biased because this is my favorite style but I have had enough regular and imperial IPAs to say this one clearly trumps them all."
"Nonetheless, this is undoubtedly an EXCELLENT beer and something I would definitely drink again."
"I'm going through withdrawal already, and I just finished my lone Pliny (luckily, I'll be in Santa Rosa in two months...light at the end of the tunnel). Wisconsin is a beer drinker's paradise, but I sincerely wish I could buy this on a regular basis. I've had a ton of memorable IPAs, but every Pliny I sip solidifies this beer's place in my desert island five."
"I want to compare pliney with dreadnaught, head to head."
"D: High drinkability for a stronger ipa. It's fresh, clean, and quite refreshing. I can easily see having a few during a single sitting."
"I am sure glad this brew is available every time beacause I cannot be without it... Stock up. Very refreshing after a long hot day at work.."
"Edit 10-23-12: I just had a 6 month, & 3 week old blind tasting. Even the 3 week old batch was starting to loose it; but the 6 month was lost."
"This is the freshest Pliny I've had. Bottled about three weeks ago. This is one of those beer that lives up to the hype. You almost expect the hops to be right in your face. But when you settle in to the balance of it all you realize this is what an Imperial IPA is all about!"
"Great Beer!!!"
"Luckily I have two more to savor!"
"Drinkability: I could drink this all the time if it was readily available, definitely one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had. Although its was not quite as hoppy as I originally hoped, I understand the hype. Expertly crafted, can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"D- if its in front of you, you need to be drinking it. You can't ever have enough as is my plan today. A half of fresh elder yes please."
"I see why this beer is rated so high, but I have had many IPA beers that top or match what is going on here. Hopslam and ST Oaked Unearthly come to mind."
"D-I could shower in Pliny."
"D- About as good as I have had. Great hop flavor but not overly bitter. Great balance and complexity. This beer deserves all the recognition and more."
"Worth the hype? Since I'm more of a stout guy, I may not be the best person to ask, but I'd put this in the same league as Ruination, my current favorite DIPA. I'm very glad to have made this trade."
"D - this is the quintessential DIPA, plenty of hops, but never overbearing and your taste buds survive, hard to stop from finishing off the 1 bottle i have too quickly"
"D: I could drink this All DAY or until I fall down. This beer is smoth and only gets better as it warms up a few degrees. The alcohol is hidden very well adding to its drinkability."
"D: Top notch DIPA. It will definitely remain on my wants list so that I can hopefully score some more."
"D: Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's and beers in general. Everyone should try this beer to know what a great DIPA tastes like. I may not pick it up every time I see it, but it is a great brew to have on any occasion. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"I have had this beer several times on-tap and I am anxious to see how the bottle version compares. A """Bottled on""" date was the month before. Pours lemony orange with a 3-inch white head which settles . Lacing is elegant and lasting. Nose is pine, orange and grapefruit. Taste though, my goodness... so refreshing, so balanced. First the citrus and some bitterness hits you, but it quickly gives way to malt biscuity sweetness. The carbonation is perfect, influencing the appearance and the mouthfeel. I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews found here. This is just a GREAT beer, period."
"I was really glad to finally try this raved about beer. I really try hard not to let preconceptions or hype sway my opinions. I also am not a biggest fan of DIPA's and my ratings can reflect that. This beer really did blow me away and I could really fall in love with the style if more beers were similar to this although I have a feeling many brewers are already trying to emulate Vinnie's creations."
"I wonder if it's better on tap?"
"After having the beer again, I adjusted """Drinkability""" 4.0 to """Overall""" 3.0. It's a solid beer, but it's just not as exciting as other options."
"D - Delicious brew, well balanced, with a light enough body to really throw down a few of these. The abv will really catch up to you quick."
"This is an amazing beer. It lives up to and surpasses the hype by a long shot. Are you kidding me? I almost feel guilty for not having this on a special occasion. Damn near flawless!"
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is WOW. Hops then some hops. But there is an underlying sweetness that has a caramel character. Smells very nice. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%."
"This is my first of this style and I enjoyed it quite a bit!"
"Hyperbole aside, the bottles aren't quite as exceptional as the fresh draft pours, though they're still outstanding and priced quite reasonably given the quality."
"D- Just about perfect!!! The only knock here is the fact that I prefer a little more """sweetness""" from my DIPAs. All in all a great beer that I would def drink again."
"Still, its a favorite that definitely will be a common occurrence in my fridge, at least for me. Thank my lucky stars that my mom lives in California. Don't tell her I plan visiting her when the beer is low...Ssshhhh!"
"I definitely will be going after more of this brew. One of the most aesthetically pleasing beers I have ever had. The lacing was absolutely the best I have ever seen. There were rings from top to bottom that showed my progress. Sweet."
"SkÅL!"
"Drink is absolutely amazing. I've had alot of IIPA's lately and I've been comparing them to this and the Younger and after all the the great reviews of other IIPA's there simply is only one great IIPA and this is it."
"PtE isn't regarded so highly because it's so difficult to get outside of the west coast. It really is a perfect DIPA."
"Well, here it is. My first Pliny the Elder, at 7 a.m., after work. Bottle date is 3-26-10, 20 days old. Pours a bright, fuzzy orange with great rocky, fluffy white head. Looks just like the Blind Pig from yesterday, although the head on Pliny retains better and leaves some more lacing. Very little sediment. Smell is lots of pine and earthy notes. Citrus hides in the background. Taste is the same, pine and earth and lots of it. Dry hops. A bit of a biscuity feel, I don't really pick up any fruit flavors at the start but towards the middle I start to pick up citrus, grapefruit, and lemon. Nice hop burps. The balance here is seriously excellent though, and the mouthfeel is probably the best I have encountered in an IPA, period. Truly a creamy elixir, perfect carbonation. Alcohol taste is nowhere to be found, I would never guess this is 8%. Drinkability is also pretty great because of this. Truthfully I am a little let down, the taste isn't quite what I expected, I actually preferred Blind Pig to this for sure. But the mouthfeel, overall balance of malt+hops, drinkability, and the masking of alcohol are huge highlights, and it succeeds maybe better than any other DIPA I've had in all those categories."
"Very happy with this beer. Was hoping for a little more sweetness in the taste (I really like Hopslam, OK?!) but definitely enjoyed the West Coast dry, piny style...I still think Hopslam is better though ;)"
"Naja's in the Redondo Beach, CA, marina. Superb beer and decent context. Pliny the Elder was recommended by their most experienced tender as the best double IPA on tap save Pliny the Younger when it is available. After 40 years of tasting ales internationally, this ranks as my all-time favorite."
"Great beer. Drink it often if you can."
"Want to rate it all fives but, could it get better? I can only imagine."
"It ranks up there with the best of the best and with almost 1,400 reviews it can't just be """follow the leader.""" The pour, taste, smell, feel, and look of this brew is just flat out gorgeous. It has all of the things I love about Double IPA's and none of the things I dislike. Enough alcohol to just barely taste and not over hopped like many DIPA's. Basically, this beer lives up to all the hype."
"Thanks again B Rob. The distinction between Pliny and all other DIPA's is that people who generally don't care for the hop bitterness will still love this beer. It has all of the taste nuances of an ipa without that bitter bite at the end that tends to push away some people from this style. Its like Jay-Z but not """Reasonable Doubt", more like """H to the Izzo.""" At the end of the day, its awesome, but inviting enough for everyone. Also, the label is one of the better beer labels around."
"I love this beer, it is just such a shame that it is hard to come by. It pours a great golden amber with some orange highlights and bright white head. The nose is complex showing great hops, citrus, grapefruit, sugar cane and sweet malts. The palate is well layered with sharp hops up front, sweet malts in the middle and finishes with fresh bitter hops. I love how there is a small amount of sweetness that balances perfectly"
"Pliny on-tap was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best beer on-tap that I've ever had. I don't see how any beer could better express the flavors of the hop flower. Perfection in taste."
"Mouthfeel is excellent; just the right balance for the bitterness and the alcohol level. A very drinkable beer which deserves the respect that it gets."
"D: A very good DIPA, that is all about the hops. Not sure it lives up to the hype, but I would agree it stands with the best of them."
"Sometimes you take for granted the things in your backyard, and Pliny is one of them. You start trading and trading to see whats out there, and your'e all, Hopslam is the best beer ever, then you have a Dreadnaught and your like..thats was awesome, but when it's all said and done, Pliny the Elder is and will always be the benchmark for the big west coast IPA. Worthy of all the hype, this is one of the best beers in the US, and in my opinion, top ten in the world."
"D - Not a real easy drinker but it isn't difficult either. If available to me regularly I would pick this one up pretty often. While not the best DIPA I've ever had (that honor would belong to Coast's Boy King) this is definitely one of the better one's I've had!"
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a soapy white head. The head leaves sheets of lace as it slowly disappears. Aroma is of full of citrus. Taste is more of the same, citrusy hop overload. Lots of fresh grapefruit and orange flavor along with some pine. Plenty of bitterness. A great beer. One of the best Ive had. After having a couple of Blind Pigs and PTE's, I think the PTE is just a notch above the Blind Pig, but both are beers by Russian River."
"D- For as bitter as this is, it's incredibly drinkable. Almost laughably drinkable. A special thanks to tbadiuk for scoring me this trade, and to the fellow from Cali who has remained unnamed thus far who sent the 4 bottles of Cali goodness."
"I have eagerly anticipated trying this brew for a long time, and it was everything I expected. It takes the hype on & scores a knockout, which is why I gave it 4.5 across the board. Bring on PtY!"
"The hype is warranted and I will try to work this in to my trading rotation. This is what I want my IIPAs to taste like."
"Taste is grapefruit and citrus hoppiness with very little malt backbone, which is how I like my DIPAs...really lets the hops shine bright. Has a ton of hop flavor and a high, but tolerable, amount of bitterness. Lingers on the palate for quite some time. Has a smooth, ganja-esque taste that is pretty nice. If I lived in the Pac-NW, I would treat myself to a PtE once in a while and I rarely find myself repeat purchasing DIPAs. This beer has a very tough task of living up to the mega hype that surrounds it, for the most part it does a good job but I cant say I will go too far out of my way to get this again."
"Like IIPA? If you can, get this, best I've tried in my favorite style."
"Too many inconsistent bottles lately."
"D - Uhhh yes please! This beer is 8% and that can really sneak up on you!"
"Overall: Very gracious of Jeff to get me something i probably won't have again. This must be killer when fresh off the line. Seek it out for sure."
"Definitely a top notch IPA."
"Aromas are rich and refreshing, like a night walk on the Mediterranean beach with an air filled by wind-carried scents of citruses (predominantly grapefruit), pines and cypresses, resin of coniferous trees and elder blossom. Besides citrusy hop character, another kind of fruitiness derived from either hops or fruity esters is evident and clean malty sweetness penetrates through the thick sheets of aromas. Excellent. Flavors showing less diversity then the nose suggested are of grapefruit and coniferous resins; semi-dry finish with lingering unharsh bitterness. The light-medium body is delicately carbonated. Finally, but not least important the eruption of finest hop qualities was crowned by nearly complete absence of perceivable alcohol."
"D: I was excited to spot this here in San Francisco, so I picked up a bottle without a second thought. An excellent Double IPA that is bursting with fruity, bitter hop flavor. Not too much else to say - pick it up if you haven't tried it."
"Overall, a great DIPA that i wish i could get at every bar i go into to!"
"The only other IPA beating this is his son """Pliny the Younger""""
"I'm glad I finally got my hands on it. Definitely one of the best in class, if not the best."
"Overall a full bodied DIPA. Certainly above average."
"D - By far the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. So far more drinkable than others that it's difficult to imagine giving it anything other than a 5. While I probably am going to suffer from a burned out palate, it sure doesn't feel that way. When it comes to DIPAs, I tend to be one and done because I know I won't be able to enjoy the second as much. With this, if I had regular access, I think two would be in order(and these are 16.9 oz. servings)."
"Bottle from Bottleworks. Hops...bang! The aroma hits with the force of a wrecking ball, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Pours an attractive gold, but with some yeast floaties. Nice white bubbly head with decent lacing.This is one incredibly hoppy beer that is balanced well with two incredibly unique tastes. First, you get a citrus sweetness on the tongue, but that quickly fades as the bitter hops linger on the palate. This has lived up to the hype and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. incredibly drinkable. Nice work, RR!"
"D - I could drink this as a session beer, discovering new flavors each sip. The lack of extreme bitterness means no need for salty snacks in between, leaving the gut open for each unfiltered sip."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Very smooth. It is scary how drinkable this IPA is at 8% abv. If you like IPA's go and find this beer. Now. Stop reading this already!"
"D: Dangerously drinkable for ABV. Alcohol is completely hidden - Savor... Not session-able without a driver/nurse! Fresh, clean, distinctive, delicate, deliberate... An exceptional, delicious, DIPA - defines the style."
"D- not horrible but tastes like a smaller version of Rogue's Imperial IPA. Not something I would want to drink more than one of, but not anything to turn ones nose up at."
"The thing that impresses me the most is the drinkability- this is an 8% sticky DIPA that goes down so easily. I only bought one and instead of savoring it, I took care of it in short order."
"Verdict: Outstanding."
"It's pretty sweet these come in such an affordable 500ml bottle, i'd buy it regularly if i could, really good stuff, but not head and shoulders above everything like the hype tells you."
"Extremely drinkable. Great beer"
"On-tap at TJ's in PA yesterday, reviewed from notes. Pours out a golden yellow with no head but a white ring and cloud. The ring actually leaves some light, spotty lacing around the glass. Smell is very good, reminds me of Sculpin but a bit less fruity and more pine up front. The hops lend pine, citrus, earthy and grapefruit notes. There is actually hints of malt which balance the nose for me. The taste is very similar. Very good hop profile balanced by a great malt backbone. The hops are citrus, piney, grapefruit and other fruity notes. The level of bitterness is perfect for an IIPA. Mouthfeel is also great. The medium body is very smooth with low-medium carbonation that suits the flavor perfectly. A bitter coat is left on the tongue. The beer has no alcohol presence, taste or MF, for me. Drinkability is killer. The taste and price ($5) were both amazing. The flavors stay very solid and the beer only gets more complex and enjoyable as I drink it very slowly. Could session this one for hours on end (not true of many IIPAs)."
"There are some beers for which quantitative ratings are really irrelevant; how do you really put a number on something as subjective as the citrus/pine aroma of a truly great IPA? Pliny the Elder is one such. Fortunately, business brought us to the area and no time was lost in making the pilgrimage to the fount. Beer is a pale amber slightly hazy with a not much head but a decent lingering lacing on the glass (for what that is worth). Major impact on the nose with an intense full-on grapefruit explosion mixed with grassy and pine overtones. One can scarce forbear to taste and it is not disappointing: predominant citrus, some butterscotch undertones, that give way to lingering dry bitter finish. Mouth coating quality lingers for an age."
"What can I say? This is the ultimate hoppy beer. It's juicy, punchy, but unbelievably smooth and complex. Pure bliss in a bottle (or a tap if your're lucky enough to have the opportunity)."
"D: Decent for its size. More drinkable if having with some food."
"Mouth/Drink: Nice bitter-dry mouthfeel. Its like eating a potato chip, you keep wanting more. Carbonation is right on. The drinkability? Superb. Is there alcohol in this? You drink it like water. Hop flavored, water."
"Visited wine country and had to have this everyday of the trip. Refilled my growler at the Santa Rosa pub daily as it is the best DIPA I have experienced. Clean mouthfeel with the anticipated piney hops notes and of course the color and aroma of the best beer in the USA and/or the world!"
"D: Very refreshing. Smooth. Delicious. I will be trading for this again at some point..."
"Edit: I just realized that 4.7 is the highest score I've given."
"Cheers!"
"Just having this again on tap at the brewpub; yes, it's better than Younger. Mouthfeel and appearance are perfect. The dryness and drinkability combined with an absolute avalanche of hop aroma and flavor just put this over the top."
"D: Most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. No hint of alcohol - just a clean, crisp, refreshing hop bomb."
"D: Superb. This is what all other DIPAs should be modeled after. I love my hops and this beer delivers, completely living up to the hype"
"(D)- A fantastic DIPA that most definitely lives up to the hype. Has everything that makes a great DIPA. Dynamic with a constantly changing mouthfeel that keeps your tastebuds busy & at full attention. Crisp & refreshing which I like. A great drinker that I could easily have a few of if given the opportunity, particularly since the alcohol level is lower than most DIPAs out there. I am definitely digging this one. Truly just a damn fine beer that I wish I could always have in my fridge."
"This beer lived up to the hype as it was very drinkable. 8% seems low for this beer as you can hardly taste any alcohol. The mouthfeel is soft and the combination of scent and flavor keep you wanting more. I enjoyed this beer so much I finished my first glass before I finished this review."
"Drinkability: After well over a thousand reviews, I'm not sure what there is left to be said. PtE is a stalwart of the style. Drinks with comparative ease considering the bold bitterness and staunch dryness, with almost no notice of the alcohol presence."
"In conclusion, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life it would be an easy choice, Pliny the Elder...that is until I get to try Pliny the Younger."
"D-I was surprised at how easy drinking this was. It wasn't the best beer I've ever had, but it was a ridiculously easy-drinking, very well-made beer."
"D- This is my mental measuring stick for IPA's from here on out. Top notch. So glad to have stumbled on this."
"Consumed: 3/10/2010"
"Drinkability very high for a DIPA. I'd take this over Younger anytime."
"I would swim in this beer, brush my teeth with it, clean my dishes with it... love how the bottle says """drink it fresh! don't age!""" Damn right, drink fresh and often..."
"Drinkibility: Very good! Easy on the palate and goes great with food"
"Overall, I guess what I am saying is that as much as it is stressed to drink this beer as fresh as possible, IMO, waiting a few months certainly didn't hurt the beer. Can't wait to visit again fresher, but for now, I still found this to be a superb brew."
"D - While I do enjoy IPAs, I would never have considered them to be my favorite style. This beer may have changed all that. I wish I had more than just the one bottle."
"As a note-a solid IPA-a very good one."
"Ok, so I was lucky enough to find someone to trade a bottle of Winter Warmer Cigar City for this beer (Thanks Phoenix2443). It was a solid, actually REALLY solid IPA. Strong Grapefruit bitterness to this sexy bitch, with just a subtle amount of sweetness. The head was a perfect color white and pretty strong. Sadly, I think this beer is a bit over-hyped and I'm not really sure why. It is a great IPA, but it defiantly wasn't life changing. I highly recommend getting your hand on one of these just to say that you have tried it. This is a true Beer Geek Beer, hard to find, and popular. This is right up my alley of IPA's."
"D - I could drink quite a bit of this. Much better than the six-month-old bottle I've had previously, and yet it still feels like I'm missing something. I guess I'll have to take a trip to Russian River and sample this on tap. Don't get me wrong, this is a hell of a beer, but it really isn't *that* much better than more readily available (D)IPAs. Still, very much recommended if you can get it."
"The Elder pours a hazy pure orange color with a nice frothy head atop and good lacing along the glass. Aromas are dominated with great Cali hops. Lots of floral, citrus, and pines also round out the nose. The smell of this makes the mouth water. Quaff is biter hops and lots of grapefruit. Best tasting DIPA I've had, hands down. Mouthfeel is bitter but yet refreshing. Drinkability is of course extremely high. A hop lovers dream for sure."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with about a half an inch of head. Tons of lacing around the edge of the glass. The hop aroma is huge, flowery, and mouthwatering. The taste is very flowery without a hint of alcohol at all. There is a slight aftertaste, but not anything offensive or overwhelming. The mouthfeel is a litle thick which is unsurprising given the alcohol content and big taste. Amazingly drinkable, probably the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had. I had to think long and hard abou giving a 4.5 or a 5 on taste, I decided to give Pliny the benefit of the doubt."
"Mouthfeel: medium-full body, gentle carbonation, and alcohol warmth"
"Drinkability: Everyday if I could. I live in Texas and sadly they RR does not distribute out here. The hops don't destroy your palate like some DIPA do. The hops dissipate rather quickly which leads me take sip after sip. Those of you in Santa Rosa are very lucky."
"If I could get this one all the time, I would certainly drink it regularily. If you can get it, drink it. If you can't, trade for it. It really is very nice. It deserves its high level of praise."
"Overall, I'd say it lives up to the hype. Excellent beer."
"I so wanted another of these. Not my favorite type of beers, but i could have definitely enjoyed a few more of these."
"A lite golden color with nice off white head, decent lacing. The beer smells nice and hoppy with some citrus overtones.. The taste is great, loaded with hops, lots of dry hopped grapefruit flavor. The fantastic thing about this beer is it's dryness. I find most DIPA's are too sweet but not the Elder, the citrus flavors really cover the huge bitterness of this beer, which is so dangerously drinkable. Cheers to Vinnie!"
"Overall, this is just a truly fantastic IPA all around. It's the first beer I've had from Russian River and it's left a huge impression on me. It nails the style with a wonderful fruity hop bitterness but keeps the hops somewhat honest with the chewy caramel malts. If you haven't tried this beer, you should make it every effort to seek it out, because it is a wonderful beverage."
"Cant wait to try the Younger."
"I have had this beer so many times, yet this is my first review of the beer. Without a doubt I will modify this post because no matter how many times I drink it, I discover new facets of this beer."
"d: My first time having this, what the hell took me so long? I'd love to have some more."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this was a really good one and gone in no time."
"d - I really do love a good IPA, but feel that many double/imperials take it too much in one direction to try and achieve flavor that ends up hurting the drinkability. This beer however has a crap load of IPA flavor and brings it well. Bravo!"
"Notes: Wonderful beer with lots of West Coast type of hop flavors. Really good mix of hops that compliment each other. Also considering what it is and the amount of hops that are tasted, it is well balanced. There is a nice bitterness, but that is more in the background."
"It's good...it's very good. But I was expecting everything I had ever dreamed in a bottle which it isn't."
"So drinkable, a refreshing hoppy masterpiece. One of the best DIPAs out there."
"500ml bottle. Pours burnished bronze. Aroma is pineapple and grapefruit and fresh wet hops, not piney. Big, full flavor. TONS of hops, much less malt flavor. Has a bitterness that is not overpowering, not sharp, but lingers. It isn't overly sharp like a lot of ipa's or alcoholy like a lot of imperial ipa's. The balance is quite remarkable. Finish is tropical fruitiness. This beer was 6 weeks old when consumed and tastes really really fresh, not in a green way, but in a fresh home brewed way."
"Smooth and tart as the best hefeweizens, crisp as the best czech pilsners. Like a kolsch, this was the perfect match for my burger, easily could have put away a few of these."
"D: So high. I want another right now! I will definitely buy again. Still one of the best beers I've had."
"really impressed with the balance of this beer. Very drinkable. Very happy with this beer"
"Epic, a deserving epic as well even with all of the hype surrounding PTY. Pliny The Elder is the poster-boy for Double IPAs. Every hophead needs to put this on their must try list."
"To me this personifies the style. I have had Pliny's younger nephew, but for the average evening I prefer the Elder! Of note, I had one of these this evening after a PTY and it was the last pour from the keg. It had a sinificant amount of yeast in the glass and it looked like a Hefeweizen! The server offered to pour me another or give it to me for free, but I declined. The yeast added a layer of complexity I had not seen before in this beer. The best PTE I have had!"
"bomber dated on 1-14-10 drank tonight poured it in to a samuel adams glass"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice thick head that thins out across the Portsmouth Brewery tulip. Smells exceptional. One of the best smelling beers ever. Lots of peach smell with a hint of grapefruit and pine. The taste is of course bitter that's balanced out with citrusy hop taste and just a touch of malt. Highly drinkable with a near perfect mouthfeel."
"This beer is easier to drink than Pliny the Younger. It's smoother, lighter bodied, well balanced and very flavorful."
"Good drinkability, but, ok, I gotta say it: given the price point, given how hard this bugger is to get, is it /really/ that good? I smell hype, and it's a little rotten. I just don't see a marked difference between this beer and Sierra Nevada's wet hop harvest, and the latter's cheaper and more widely distributed (not to mention the lower ABV lets you drink more of it while still tasting its complexity). I guess the holy grail factor makes this beer more highly rated. Not that I'd turn it down. Ever. Clearly the product of a great deal of experience and precision. Tastes like what American craft brewing is all about."
"Slainte."
"this was a real treat, my buddy had this shipped from cali for my birthday, i told him i didn't think i'd ever get one. has a pretty clear color on it, compared to other IPA's also has a nice white head and laces nicely too. smell is just awesome, has a nice mixture of mostly floral hops but with a hint of citrus, just awesome.. taste is heavenly, i'm sad that i wont be able to get it again, but i'm ecstatic that i get to drink it, it really is a treat."
"Drinks great, though it's pretty damn bitter with almost no sweetness for balance. I don't mind the skew but others might not care for it. There are very few DIPAs that I can actually say are refreshing to drink, and this is one of those few. Vinnie, please have my children."
"This is nice... but maybe not as nice as I expected. The curse of high expectations perhaps. Or maybe it's the fact that I'm moving towards lower ABV brews. Either way, I preceded this with a Blind Pig and for me, the Pig is the way to go."
"Pours a wonderful golden orange color with a large white head. A lot of viscous white lacy head retention; just excellent. Smells of pine, orange zest, fresh flower bouquet, ripe fruits and grass. Taste is not a letdown, tastes as it smells. Large piney flavor with citrus and breadiness and an amazingly smooth bitterness throughout that leaves its lasting impression. Very well balanced and smooth, not an overbearing hop bomb - has a slight maltiness to keep it under control. Light carbonation dances gaily upon my tongue. Greatness. I must admit that I have had this fresher and that the hop does seem to fade slightly over the time. Still hands down the best DIPA I have ever had - a real treat to the taste buds."
"D: This beer is always a pleasure to drink when super fresh. After about a month and a half the hops, which are pretty much all this beer is, fade quickly and the brew degrades. Fresh, this beer delivers in an amazing way!"
"D- Well here it comes and I'm sure that this won't be a popular opinion but while this a really good dipa I feel it just falls amongst the league of high quality citrus forward dipas. I wanted this to be mind blowing but it was just good and tasty."
"11/11/09 - This beer is awesome. The nose on it is ridiculous. It's like sticking your nose into a bag of hops. Taste is smooth, good malty backbone. Good bitterness. Crisp. Awesome. If I could get this... it would always be in my glass... i mean fridge. This is my favorite DIPA and I could put down a number of these in one sitting if I had access to it."
"Drinkability: There's not much I can add to this beer than what has already been said. This is simply an outstanding beer. The hop profile is, what I like to call, clean...it's not just a heap of bitterness thrown about like a monkey sh!t fight at the zoo. The hops have character and are finally balanced with the malt. This beer's only rival would have to be its """Younger""" brother. Highly highly recommend."
"Today is 2/12/2010 and it's my second Pliny. My first was from the same bottling date but I drank it on 1/29/2010. Over 2 weeks it has lost some spunk, so drink fresh!"
"And can someone please explain to me how Pliny ends up in Philly sometimes but never Boston? What's the logic behind that?"
"CHEERS!!"
"D- extremely delicious stuff that always goes down too fast, leaving you wanting more. I would have this all the time if I had it available. always a pleasure to drink one."
"Overall, hype does not do this beer justice. I wish Pliny the Elder was considered a local everywhere."
"Like everyone has already said, this is an excellent DIPA. I think one of the main aspects of Pliny that sets it apart from other DIPAs is that it is so well balanced. Lots of amazing hops upfront, malts in the middle and light on the finish. You just want to keep reaching for this beer, especially if you love hops. Russian River has hit the nail on the head with this one. A must try for every beer lover."
"Overall one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. Extremely well balanced taste with great complexity. The flavors just keep evolving and developing through the whole bottle. Leaves me satisfied but still wanting more. It's really too bad that this beer doesn't see distribution in Michigan."
"D. Very drinkable. I wish I had more than one available."
"Libation: An absolutely lovely creation. Potent, tasty yet smooth enough to make it very easy to drink. The 8% ABV simply cannot be felt/tasted and it's easy to down more than one bottle even though they are half a liter each. Cheers to Russian River brewer Vinnie Cilurzo for his efforts here."
"D) Really good! A little too bitter for me, so one to take your time with. Definitely wish I had another afterwards. A fantastic hoppy treat I am delighted to have gotten to try."
"Do whatever you can to at least try this beer-- it truly is a top 5-10 brew."
"Drinkability: One to sip, but it's entirely delicious. The only thing really holding this one back from going down quicker is the bitterness, which is great and totally acceptable for the style and ABV. The combination of smell and taste is really quite excellent. I love when a beer can have significantly different yet still complementary smell and taste elements--nicely done."
"Cloudy golden orange color with a frothy white head, nice retention, little lacing. Aroma is a balance yet distinct blend of hops, malt, and tons of citrus (grapefruit, orange, mango, etc). Flavor is upfront with blend of citrus before balanced with malt and strong hop/pine bitterness, balanced throughout, body is medium thick, crisp and a clean finish. This fresh bottle had much more bitter hop flavors than I remembered from other experiences with this beer."
"The definative west coast DIPA for a reason. Perfect example of flavor, nose and feel.(that is if a hop bomb is what you crave as opposed to the more balanced examples of the style.)"
"Overall- incredible balances and drinkable. not too bitter or sweet. alcohol is clean. best dipa."
"Drinkability - Quite session-able for an Imperial IPA. The flavor is outstanding. My personal favorite beer."
"EDIT: I'm editing my review because I just recently had another Pliny from a different, newer batch, and man this thing is consistently awesome. Additionally, I believe the """taste""" element of this beer warrants a 5. I'm moving to California because of a beer, bye."
" D: If I lived closer to this DIPA it would be even more drinkable, that is the only thing that is holding me back from cracking the other two bottles tonight. I find this brew to quite drinkable the 8% ABV is not even noticeable in the mouth... just the buzz. Most IPAs that I enjoy are 7%+ so this brew just seems slightly bigger. The hops are the addiction here....I feel i could order this in lieu of my usual grapefruit juice for my greasy spoon diner breakfast."
"D= One bomber is enough for now, but now that I know where to find this, I will incorporate it into my IPA repertoire."
"Overall: A fantastic beer indeed. I went into this glass a bit hesitant; the intense aroma kind of put me off as I really don't have much taste for heavily hopped brews, but the complex taste and spot on aftertaste had me enjoying sip after sip. Definitely worth savoring, but damn easy to drink, too, and at 8%..."
"very good beer. i have waited years to try this all-time great for some reason. and, i wasn't dissapointed having finally sampled it."
"Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel as it dances on the tongue. Medium carbonation. Drinkability is good as the alcohol only shows up as a warming effect in the throat. I need more of this IPA!"
"It has a good, smooth but not terribly unique mouthfeel. It is very drinkable especially with heavier/hot/spiced food."
"d - I really liked this beer. I had heard a lot about it and it did not disappoint. This is a great DIPA especially if you like that piney/citrus smell and taste in a DIPA."
"The taste mirrors the aroma perfectly. Grapefruit, oranges, pine, pineapple, and mango combine to make a tasty brew. I can't believe how smooth this beer is to drink. The 8% abv is very well hidden. Medium bodied with proper carbonation. Finishes dry. Almost insanely drinkable. I'm glad I was able to get this from South Bay Drugs."
"d- wonderfully drinkable, i savored every sip, getting more and more sad as the bottle emptied. this is hands down the best beer i've ever had, and the standard to which all dipas should be held. man, i never thought i'd be saying those words about any beer. pliny blew me away, i need an unlimited supply!"
"D - If I could have this at all times in my fridge, I would. Just an awesome beer. I envy those who can get this on somewhat regular basis."
"Appearance is inviting it pours a clean golden color and produces an amazing amount of head on my first pour. Overflowed the pint glass a bit, oops. The smell is very similar to the appearance. Very clean and crisp. I get a distinct orange and lemon presence blended with piney resin. The taste is agressive! Lots of citrus and pine up front. Finishes surprisingly clean for how strong the flavors are. I'm impressed. Mouthfeel is great! lots of carbonation and it very crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is good, but your tastebuds get a work out. A great beer for sure."
"Alot of DIPA or IPAs tend to be quite similar, but Pliny stands out in both it's complexity and character. It is over-hyped (no doubt fed by the brewery's choice to keep distribution inconsistent most places) but despite that, there is no getting around the fact that Pliny is a ridiculously solid beer."
"D: Real tasty and easy to drink. A great west coast IPA for sure, but not exactly my favorite brew."
"Drinkability is great very enjoyable, anyone have a clone of the Pliny's they would like to share? Stuff is so good no alcohol noted you could drink this all day, every day."
"Drinkability.... This is what I could consider my daily drinker... If I can come home and have a bottle or two of this beer... I am relaxed and feeling positive for the rest of the night. Very drinkable... very enjoyable."
"the hop profile both in aroma and flavor just surpass so many other dipa's im very excited to compare it to alot of others tonight but like i said, everone else has already said it about this beer. very fruity and sweet and hoppy and fresh!"
"D: At 8% ABV and high IBU's, this one's best with food, but you'll probably want two."
"I remember trying this on my West-Coast swing last year and not being as blown away as I am today. Maybe it was old, maybe it wasn't cold enough, maybe I was too in love with Temptation at the time. But I take it all back: This is one of the best IPA's I've had, bar none."
"As I said, it is so unique that you simply have to try this to truly understand why this is so amazing. It is obvious that the makers of this beer know what they are doing."
"Once I built a tolerance for DIPAs, they've become my session beers. Sick."
"Tastes very strongly of Pine, grapefruit, citrus, long bittering sensation aftershock after you have taken a few sips. Definitely not undesirable, just possibly not my favorite way to have an ipa. I prefer an IPA more on the sweet side - seems to be a slight dry cloying bite at the very end. Light carbonation, light to medium mouthfeel that is very good for the style. Two of these would go down smoothly"
"Drinkability: The ABV is about as well hidden as your likely to find in an IIPA which makes this dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a dark hazy orange with thick foamy head. Head is golden and sparkles in the light (no really). Head goes away eventually and leaves gobs of lace on the glass. The smell is amazing - tons of hops and citrus. Reeks of farm fresh oranges. Taste is appropriately bitter and sweet with a tremendous hop kick. More citrus and honey with a small malt backbone. A true hophead's dream. Alcohol is very well hidden too. The mouthfeel is great, less thick than most DIPAs which I like. Extremely drinkable as the 500ml is gone before I even realize it. Luckily I bought a bunch! This one completely lives up to the hype."
"D - The final effect is the most drinkable IPA/IIPA ever created. For this alone, it deserves its reputation."
"Drinkability is off-the-charts. If I could get this regularly, I definitely would. One of the best IIPAs, I've had. Definitely a hop-forward brew, delicious. Cheers to Josh for this one!"
"Poured into a snifter.%0A%0AGolden yellow%2Forange in color. A bit of haziness. A nice white head about a fingers worth. Fluffy and sticky. Sticks to the glass the entire way down.%0A%0AI picked out some light like citrus in the nose. But it was mostly dominated by a floral like grassy aroma and lots of pine. Very potent nose overall.%0A%0AAt first there is a white grapefruit%2F floral flavor followed by a touch of sweetness from the malts. After a second a piney resiny flavor kicks in and pine dominates. Almost like chewing on pine needles. (but in a good way)%0A%0AMouthfeel is fabulous. Lots of oily hoppy goodness in the mouth that then turns dry and clean on the swallow leaving you wanting another sip.%0A%0ADrinkability is perfect. I could sit down and drink this all day long no doubt about it. I can see why Pliny The Elder is held in such such a high regard. It is a wonderfully crafted beer that i'm lucky enough to have finally gotten my hands and tastebuds on."
"D--I just dont enjoy over-hopped beers. The only beer that I really enjoy that is an IPA is Two-hearted, which in my humble opinion, kicks this beers ass. I just dont get drinking Pine sol I guess...I will stick to tasty beers moving forward with malt, flavor profile and character, not pine sol."
"It is so incredibly drinkable, even though it has been hopped to hell it is still a perfect balance of bitter and sweet."
"The feel is excellent, hard pressed to be better in fact. The beer coats the mouth like a jacket. Silky stickiness is held in check by the perfect amount of carbonation to keep it sharp and crisp . Body is full and chewy, the finish is long and dry. Mouthwatering at the end of every drink, this one's a champ."
"Served in a tulip glass, it was golden amber with some slight cloudiness, a nice sticky looking head and great lacing. Mouthwatering aroma of American hops with lots of pine notes, and some sweet bready fragrances in the background. I was blown away after one sip by how a beer with so much bitterness and hop flavor can come out so balanced. Loads of pine and white grapefruit hop flavor in the forefront, but with plenty of malt sweetness to back it up. There seemed to be a little bit of cannabis like skunkyness in the ultra dry finish that mixed in with the seemingly endless piney hop aftertaste and just the right amount of alcoholic warmth. Unlike other doubles like 90 and Hop Wallop, this beer finishes very dry, despite the amount of sweetness. This dry finish and the medium body make it all too drinkable. Vinnie has crafted a very well done beer that does a great job of distinguishing itself amongst a crowded style. Bravo!"
"I could smell Pliny the Elder for days as perverse as that sounds, but honestly wouldn't want to drink it that long. I'd be pretty trashed. Ok, extremely trashed if I drank it for days. Add a couple more pounds of malt is my opinionated, home brewer's opinion. Just do not change the most perfect bouquet of Pliny the Elder."
"I don't get as excited about IPAs (and other hop-heavy derivatives) as I used to, but this one is perfect for the style."
"D: Great for 8% abv. I could straight session this guy."
"I recieved a few of the bottles in the mail after trying a bottle given by Steve at Kickbacks. Not available in my area, but Lord I really wish that it was. This is one of the best beers that I have ever had. The smell is what I wish that my house smelled like. The taste was hoppy but not so hoppy that it overpowered the malty backbone of it. I have a few bottles left and I am going to savor every drop of them until I can get my hands on more."
"Overall, I'd say this was one of my first beer I had a 'holy shit!' moment with. I've had this a few times since then but it still blows my mind how perfect this beer can be. I really wish I had reviewed this beer the very first time I had drank it to capture that moment but this does just fine. Way to go Russian River!"
"Right up front there is a orange flavor that quickly changes to a floral bitterness, orange peel, notes of tobacco, a leathery bite, has a nice chewy mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers for a long time with a dry aftertaste. There is a malty sweetness in there as well with some biscuit notes. Alcohol is hidden very well. Nice drinking."
"Overall, the bar by which other DIPA should aspire to be, the gold standard."
"If you're looking for a double IPA with a nice balancing malt sweetness, this is not it. But if you want that hoppy goodness with crisp, clean, focused bitterness, this is it. Excellent."
"*This is one of the most perfectly balanced DIPA I've had. If you haven't had it, GET IT. 1200+ beers advocates can't be wrong."
"Drinkibility is perfect. I can and have drank pitchers of this beer. Not by myself of course, but pliny is definitely a beer I always have stocked in my mini fridge. From the aroma of mango, to the perfect amount of bittering and light body, I can't believe this beer is 8%. One of the best of the style."
"Alcohol is hidden very well. Very smooth and easy to drink DIPA. I wish I could drink this everyday. However, I must say, I think I would give Blind Pig a slight advantage."
"Gold pour with a slight pink tint and a big loose white head with lots of lacing. Lots of bright citrus and bubblegum ester aroma with notes of honey, toffee, and lemon grass. The hop profile is much more bitter and piny than the aroma. There's still a nice balance of honey and toffee malts. Medium body with soft carbonation."
"D- A really drink friendly beer. Not sure if I can handle more than one."
"D: keep 'em coming; feels just as good as it tastes"
"Pours a golden orange color with a nice fluffy off white head, with great lacing. Has a slightly sweet fruity/citrusy smell with mangos, grapefruit, and piny hops. Taste is lots of resiny, piny hops up front, then some light fruits, mangos, grapefruit, pears, and then ends with a nice hop bitterness. Very clean, and crisp with a light-medium mouthfeel. Overall, you cant ask for any more out of an DIPA."
"The word of the day is """balanced.""" I also feel I'll appreciate PtE the more I get my hands on it. The Elder is an intelligently humble beer and I don't think just one tasting does Him justice."
"I dont know if I could have more than 2 pints in a night, but certainly drinkable in that I could have one every day."
"A really delicious beer that is super drinkable, to the point where I think it straddles the line between IPA and DIPA - almost too smooth for how hoppy it is. Fantastic."
"Pours a yellow gold. The aroma is mainly hops, fruity and piney. The taste is what shocked me most, there is a real apple sort of flavor. I don't know what that is but its interesting. I can't say I love it but I do find it intriguing. Enough bitterness to satisfy. Pretty drinkable for a larger IPA. Its obviously a well made beer and worth seeking out for the experience but the hype that seems to still be around it is maybe a bit much. I am glad though that much more of the country is seeing some distribution and hopefully one day we'll be getting it over here."
"d- if you are not into hops you are not going to like this beer. plain and simple. if you are, i find it EXTREMELY difficult to not enjoy this beer, or fall in love with this beer. period."
"Nose is very floral. Hops galore from the first sip all the way through. Finishes dry and thin. This one is fruity sweet with hops and slightly resiny. Maybe picking up some sugars here as well. great IPA from a master brewer...This one being 100+ ibu's a little too hoppy for me anything over 70 is considered a waste of hops but this is a hop monster.."
"Everyone should try this beer at least once. I'm not a huge fan of IPAs but I'd drink it again."
"Pours a golden color with a white head. The predominant aroma is grapefruit. There is a ton of hop flavor in this beer with grapefruit and citrus as well as maybe some earthiness. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but that doesn't detract from the overall experience. Very drinkable beer with a complex hop flavor profile, but the beer is still very well balanced. I can see why this beer is rated as highly as it is."
"Exceedingly drinkable. I could go for another one right now."
"D: Pedestal this brew cause that's what it needs. Pliny is welcomed any day 'round here, my address is..."
"Appearance, whoa, straw yellow, but so damn clear, but I never like anything this color, so I can't say its exceptional. Everything else is. Delic uber (subject to deletion, not English?) hoppy resinous grapefruit make your nose hairs stand up aroma. Taste is almost like you feel your dopamine kick in and give you a physical addiction to the beer. Mouthfeel and drinkability = forever. Its got a gripload of delicious hops throughout it. Citrus, pine and tropical fruit all at once, a corn syrup primer/addition keeps the body light and dry. This is what its all about."
"Conclusion: It's a legend; I'm so glad I finally got to try this. Thanks SO much to Tolann for this, what an awesome trade. I can honestly say that this is everything I was expecting and more (and I was afraid that I would be disappointed because of the hype that this beer carries with it)."
"Overall/notes: I drank this and watched In Bruges. I know, it's a movie set in Belgium, but I didn't have any at the time! Didn't matter: they're both amazing. Drink this beer if you get a chance. I'm buying more before I leave for Columbia. Lots, lots more...."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, some carbonation, nice small fizzy off-white head which lasted a little while, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, piney, grapefruit, and some caramel. The taste is a little sweet and lots of hops, and grapefruit. Medium body. Very drinkable,"
"D - SEND MORE TYLER!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" golden beige head above the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Pillowy head falls ever-so slowly, with sticky lasting lace. Aroma is stoutly of herbal and piney hops. Taste begins with a peek of bitter, goes sweet in the middle, and closes with bitterness and the hops character seen in the nose. Mouthfeel is super smooth, and drinkability is incredible. A beer this hoppy without providing nasty bitter face takes skill. This one is always a pleasure."
"D: A third please?"
"Seriously one of the best beers I have ever tasted."
"All in all, for an IPA lover, I think this would be awesome. It has the IPA refreshment but also has a unique flavor for an IPA. Original, but not really my style."
"This is one of the top ranked IPAs, but the flavor profile is just a bit too piny for me. I prefer the grapefruit brews like Sculpin. I still love this beer and recommend it to all IPA lovers."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"D: Near perfect IPA. I will drink PTE whenever it is available."
"D: I guess after 10 or so of these, I might consider trying something else."
"A truly solid DIPA. I had been waiting quite a while to try this and maybe the hype behind the beer influenced my review. Who knows? Any fan of hoppy beers needs to seek this one out."
"Lightly carbonated with a thin body, but perfect for the refreshing nature of this beer. With the combination of crispness and noticeable but subtle sweetness, PtE ranks among one of the most drinkable DIPA's I have had the pleasure to savor."
"This is frickin' tasty DIPA that is way too drinkable for it's ABV, so smooth and trips the light fantastic on the tongue. The tap version of this (or Pliny the Younger) might be my perfect IPA. Must find...."
"Thanks again, Eric!"
"Great DIPA...citrus, hoppy, bitter, lots of grapefruit aftertaste. Refreshing, light and crisp, and flavorful for a DIPA."
"M&D - this beer is insanely balanced and super smooth the for the hop bomb it packs, super smooth, its hard to not allow this beers reputation influence my review, but simultaneously not be too harsh for the same reason, this beer is an A, and should be"
"D: Great beer, hop bomb that isn't too over the top, excellent representation of the style, goes down a little too easily... damn you for not distributing my way!"
"Imperial pint, golden amber brew, a finger and a half of rocky white head, slow dissipation with exquisite lacing. Huge grapefruity hop nose with a bit of bready malts providing a nice balance. The taste is much like the smell, huge chunky grapefruit hops with a bit of noble pine hidden, and bready malts, leading to a smooth dry finish. Not overly bitter, nice and fruity. Dangerously drinkable. There is nothing in the world like fresh Pliny, and in the end, I much prefer the tap version. An exemplar of the style. If you can find a fresh keg sit down, relax, and enjoy one of the world's best beers. Outstanding."
"D: While it's very well made there was surprisingly little going on. I like my DIPA's with a little more complexity and malty sweetness on the end. In RR river terms i would classify this as just a regular IPA - to explain away the lack of sweetness - and the PtY as their DIPA. Good but I've had far better."
"It's amazing, and it earns its sterling reputation. Still, it doesn't quite take the dIPA crown for me (DFH 90 Minute still wins). I'm gonna have to find a hookup in California so I can get this every couple of months."
"This lives up to the hype and is recommended if you like DIPAs."
"Let me follow suit. Aquired this is trade from Sideswipe. Poured into my Great Lakes Brewery pint glass. Poured a dark golden color with about a finger width of head. Great smell strong hop aroma. Taste was perfectly hopped not much malt presence but its not neeed. Mouthfeel is really good. I prefer a thicker mouthfeel but this was very good. High drinkability, smooth, alcohol flavor is very hidden. Summary: Great beer, great flavor, well constructed, and highly recommended."
"Bottle is coverd with DO NOT AGE warnings and I think it best to heed this warning. I get much more hop from this and less malt flavor compared to most other IIPA and don't think that letting the hop profile decrease with age would be very good."
"It pours a beautiful amber with a surprisingly thick head. Complex and delicious aroma popping with hop and floral nodes. Wonderful balanced taste that incorporates everything one would want in an IPA. It is amazingly drinkable for a double IPA. Arguably one of the best American made beers."
"Extremly drinkable for a hop freak such as myself."
"The drinkabillity is top notch. You could imbibe all day and night enjoyng every sip."
"Cheers!"
"Excellent Beer, I would definitely suggest it"
"Incredibly drinkable, perhaps too drinkable? Not heavy or thick in the mouth, goes down quickly and easily; this beer is absolutely refreshing, which I wouldn't often say about a DIPA."
"Mild carbonation, smooth feel for such a broad, rich palate. Very flavorful, but not a palate-wrecker. 500 ml will leave you wanting more."
"Mouthfeel & Drink - Thinner than I thought it would be but it works. Hops are aggressive. Drinkability is limited due to aggresive hoppiness but not awful."
"I've been waiting for a long time to try this beer, and it certainly didn't disappoint. This is one of the overall best balanced beers I've had, with no weaknesses discernible in any area. A standout for sure in terms of the taste, it's wonderful that Russian River didn't succumb to the typical California brewing philosophy of IBU's over flavor. It also complimented my meal extremely well, and didn't overwhelm the subtle flavors of my Office Burger. Supremely drinkable. This will become the yardstick that I measure all other IPA's with."
"The pint was a orange/bronzy color with a touch of haze. Hopalicious aroma! Citrus, pine-you name it. As expected the hops were the first thing noted when tasting the Pliny, which then yielded to an earthy fruitiness as the pint went on. Yummy. Even though it was 8% I was happy to have a couple of pints in fairly quick succession. I wish I didn't have to travel 2/3 of the way across the country to have some."
"d - even though its 8% it's an easy drink. wouldn't mind having a few pliny during any night"
"O: Best sample of Pliny i've had so far, great hoppiness but a bit too vegetative/rough hop presence. Still very good"
"One of the best beers I've ever had. I could drink alot of this. Excellent just excellent."
"only other that i've had that was as good was a well aged great divide hercules and the double crooked tree by dark horse... great great brew."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those who need to try the gold standard for IPA's. For all the hype on this I would have this again given the opportunity and I need to try this on tap."
"This is among my favorite beers and would rate higher if it were more affordable and available."
"500 ml. Quite possibly the most balanced beer i've ever had. Aromas were fresh, and the mouthfeel was so smooth I couldn't believe it was 8%. Thank God I have more of this to enjoy for the next few months. This really is the base model for every IIPA to follow, so complex and balanced it makes me wonder why anyone else tries. The citrus and floral notes are so good it screams for me to buy more. AHHH."
"Overall, after having this the first time this became the beer I measure all other IPA's to. A few come close but Pliny remains a world class beer in my opinion. I will buy this whenever I have the opportunity."
"D: Really the definition of drinkability. I didn't want this one to end and I'm sad that it did... the hunt continues for another!!"
"My favorite beer of all time! Once I took a whiff of this beer, I was hooked. Floral hints along with tangerine and grapefruit reach my pallet immediately. It's very smooth from start to finish, and doesn't fill you up too much. I could drink this beer every day!"
"D- For an 8% beer, its very drinkable. Great beer. Not quite as good as I expected, but def. a cut above the rest."
"Unbelievable that this is 8% as it is not detected at all. So tasty and easy to drink. I would buy this beer all the time if I had access to it. This lives up to the hype and is at the top of the DIPA list."
"Like the damnation I had the same night, I've heard so much hype about Russian River beers that I just had to try this one out. Either the bar I visited where I sampled this (and the tap system) didn't do this beer justice, or I'll have to try this beer a lot closer to the brewery itself for a more fitting review."
"Looking back at this review has me embarrassed as fuck...that last paragraph is just sad."
"Pliny The Elder is a cloudy golden ale with a thin, dense, white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a huge, fresh, floral, grassy aroma. It smells like... stepping outdoors. It's medium bodied, minerally and crisp. The finish is clean. It's nice and bitter with a full hop flavor. There are notes of flowers, grass, herbs and fresh ground black pepper. This is how a double IPA should taste. It was very much a pleasure to enjoy this at the Trappist in Oakland."
"Poured into Unibroue tulip from 16.9 ounce bottle (thanks to Edmund Wilson for sending this across the country) Bottled on 10/08/09. Aroma is of pine and grapefruit, straight-up. Crazy, silly, wicked, spider webby head and lacing. Beautiful. Can't really move on past the aroma. Satisfied right now. No need to drink the beer. Everything else at this point forward is a bonus. Ok, I'll drink it. This beer has been described at great lengths before me so at this point it is redundant to add to the pile. All I can say is that one day I hope that Pliny makes it to Florida because this beer is magical, mystical, delicious and breathtaking."
"D - This one can continue to be drunk. The fresher the better."
"drinkability: overall one of the best."
"O: This is the premier DIPA our there, it is unparralleled in flavor."
"After trying this mythic ale on three separate occasions, I must officially admit that all the hype isn't just internet gossip. This brew is the real deal!"
"D - Incredibly enjoyable and beautiful drink. It's reputation is well deserved."
"Drinkability- I can drink it all day long."
"First let me say, I love IPA's and I have had few amazing, most average and some terrible. This beer is so amazing, its one of the best IPA's Ive ever had. It is remarkably balanced and delicious, it has a beautiful grapefruit and citrus hop flavor. Very nice golden color, and a bit cloudy. It doesnt leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth like some IPA's do. As far as IPA's go, there are few, if any, which are better.--- I have finally been able to track down some bottles to give it a proper review, as opposed to the 4 or 5 sips the last time, review to follow 1/2010"
"D: Good for a couple, perhaps not too many at 8% and with such heavy bitterness."
"Overall, a very well crafted DIPA. Deserving of its reputation. Get your hands on this one hop-heads."
"Mouthfeel is great. There is plenty of flavor to connect some (the tiny amount) of sweetness at the front with the hop bitterness and flavor. Its so good. Medium body, can't taste the alcohol at all. Drinkability very high. This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had in my life. I wish this were sold locally. If you can't get it locally, set up a trade to get this beer."
"The drink is medium-bodied with heft, silkiness, and extremely fine carbonation. A sticky trace that I perceive as hop oils lingers on my palate long after the drink is long gone. Eminently drinkable, Pliny is indeed 'all that', and walks the talk in spades, big-time. Thanks for the opportunity, Tim. Unreal-good brew."
"Drinkability- Excellent, possibly the best DIPA, I will definitely drink this again. It is wonderful."
"D: Extremely drinkable. You could either sip this slowly and appreciate the great balance between bitter and sweet or session a few in a row, though the alcohol content will catch up to you pretty quick. This is probably the best IPA I've had and is deserving of most of the hype."
"Pint bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 11.04.08, drank 1.14.09 at 53°f. Super clear golden with a giant fluffy white white, which settles down to a solid 1/4""" that hangs around. Tons of sticky lace. Aroma is sweet hops coming forward as pineapple and other vaguely tropical smells. The flavor is super juicy, hops, sugary lemons and pineapple, despite initially sweet, it finishes dry, tangy and lightly acidic along the sides of my tongue. The ABV leaves a light tingle. This thing finishes super clean, no coating, with just a light warming sensation in the back of the throat. I could bathe in this stuff."
"I was not disappointed upon cracking the Coronado (situational enjoyment, perhaps?), but this just blows it out of the water. The only thing that I would protest (slightly) is the carbonation. However, this is from someone longing for the cask ale that was enjoyed a few months (far too long) ago..."
"Bottom line: you're not going to do a lot better. I still get excited when I see it."
"Drinkability is through the roof."
"D. This beer is very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well behind layers of hop and malt flavors. Overall this is just a great beer. I had extremely high expectations when I opened this beer, which usually spells disappointment for me, but this time it more than lived up. Great beer."
"This one is as good as it gets."
"As a lover of the american IPA, this is superb. Thanks to the kind heart of Rick at Big Z beverage in Huntington, I was able to try this beer. It had a wonderful piney hop aroma. It was probably the best smelling beer hopwise that I have ever experienced. The color was a cloudy orange with a nice head. The flavor was extremely balanced. The flavor of the hops was not overpowering nor was it too bitter. The malt flavor was hidden by the hops which was ok for me because the hop flavor was so explosive. This is a must try for any IPA fan. I could drink this IPA all day. Russian River is amazing."
"This is a very well-made beer, make no mistake, but over hyped in my opinion. Quite balanced, but I prefer a DIPA that clearly leans toward the hoppy side."
"What a drinkable beer. I keep asking myself is it because of my thirst? Couldn't believe I would like an IPA so much. After second bottle I still like it very much. So different than my stouts and strong ales, bur lovely beer. Light, hoppy, citrusy, carbonated but overall very well balanced beer. Love it very much so far. I'll have it chilled when i'm thirsty."
"I did purchase a case of this last week in California and brought it home, I was very surprised at how reasonably priced it was considering the status of this beer. Granted, it wasn't cheap, but for what I paid for it, it definitely was reasonable. Pliny is exceptional, but with the number of talented brewers out there, it definitely stands out in the crowd but not heads and shoulders above the rest. It's perhaps a little bit hyped but I have to say I really enjoyed it. If you're not a hop head, run away, this beer isn't for you. I absolutely love this one."
"Overall, wow. 8%? Really... I mean really??? 8, I mean come the fuck on. Balanced is not always a good word when it comes to DIPA's. Pliny is balanced, but in an extremely good way. I wish I could put how I feel about this beer into words. But I can't, I can only think of one word to explain my relationship with Pliny. Wow."
"I find that many double IPAs are far too sweet and syrupy while others are overly aggressive in their bitterness and almost all are other one-dimensional, tossing aside complexity and balance for simple lop-sided strength. This beer suffers from none of those problems."
"T: I was a little nervous about trying this beer... no way it could live up to the hype. But it pretty much did... one of my first (THE first?) DIPAs I've had... I've probably been spoiled from here on out."
"Dry bitter floral hop blast up front with a lot of chewy resinous oily hop notes. There are so many different flavors going on here and this is the most well balanced, drinkable beers I've ever had. Lots of sweet citrus notes, mostly lemon peel and grapefruit ans a nice creamy body with subtle malt that provides a perfect balance. Dry sticky pine notes come through in the finish but it is stiil very floral and extremely smooth and quaffable. There is a very slight alcohol warmth towards the end of the swallow and in the finish but otherwise the ABV is very well masked. This beer is so flavorful and well balanced that's it's dangerously drinkable. I love this beer and have to say it's in my top five all time."
"As I have remarked many times before, I can drink this until I can no longer stand up, and then I could continue until I can't see. No beer can be 5s across the board so I will knock a half point on mouthfeel for slightly sharp carbonation. Just distracts with bubbles instead of smoothing or adding a welcome creaminess."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"An outstanding double IPA that happens to fit my preferences: strong hop flavors, firm bitterness, and lean malt that stays out of the way."
"Drinkability: I could have several. Well worth the hype. Along with Nugget Nectar, for me this is one of my favorite hoppy beers. The pine is more pronounced here than in any other beer I have had. Just a great beer."
"notes: also one of my favorite bottles. i'd put this up there with my top 5 DIPA's easily. a real treat."
"I hate to buy into the hype, but wow! this was a very good beer. I certainly doesn't hurt the the bottle I received was only 7 days old. Incredibly drinkable, with, I think it's safe to say, absolutely no alcohol presence. I am definitely going to have to trade for more of this! Now if only I could get my hands on some PtY somehow. lol"
"Tried this beer after much anticipation, and I must say, it did not disappoint. Light transparent orange poured into a pint glass, with a finger of white head leaving a nice lace throughout most of the glass. Pine and grapefruit notes are prevalent, with some added bitter citrus and well-balanced hoppiness. Taste was lighter than I had anticipated, but was plenty complex and had great hop presence and citrus chracteristics, balanced by a subtle maltiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Not as sharp and destructive feel as some other DIPA's, and just the right amount of carbonation to compliment the bite. The 8% abv is barely noticeable, and this is an extremely drinkable beer. I could go through several in an outing if unstopped. This is always in high demand throughout local beer stores, and is truly one of the greater DIPA's on the market. I will definitely pick up some more when it is available."
"This is one damn fine beer, it just edges out FFF Dreadnaught as my favorite in the category. It may not be as epic as people tout it to be but as far as DIPA's go it may just be the king."
"Very good brew."
"D-This would be the only 1/2 barrel Keg of IPA that I would ever be able to finish. So smooth that you don't notice that it's a double IPA. Best Double I have had, can't wait to try the Younger."
"500 ml bottle- pours a deep yellow straw with excellent clarity and frothy white head. Nose- intense hop nose of fresh hops- pine, tropical fruit, you name it. Just a blast of hop goodness. Its a hop head's dream. They should make a cologne that smells like this. Taste- sweet tropical fruit followed by cookie dough and caramel. The hop bitterness shines through in the finish with no trace of astringentness. Body is quite light for the strength of the beer, carbonation is spot on. A true gem"
"D - I would not have a problem being able to drink a half dozen or perhaps more 22 oz bottles in one session."
"Remarkably drinkable. Alcohol masked well and goes unnoticed through out. Easy and enjoyable to drink. I can into this one with impossibly high expectations, this beer is put on a pedestal and rightfully so. No doubt a top three DIPA in my book but just not certain it is the absolute creme de la creme."
"Color is bronze with good lacing ; very appealing herbal-citrus-hoppy smell ; taste of hops strong but the solid malt balances it ; strong bitterness but a nice sweet note comes in too. For 8.00 abv this beer is amazingly drinkable. Its world class status is well-deserved. I wish it were easier to find here in N.Y."
"This has a very smooth mouthfeel, slightly sticky. Nicely dry but not over the top so. This is one heck of a beer."
"glassware: pint"
"The bitterness carries the flavour, the flavour carries the bitterness. The key to an IPA of this boldness is balance. Some have it, others don't. This one's got it in spades."
"D - The dry finish coupled with the lingering citrus fruit flavor begs for more sips. 500 mL comes and goes. The feel, the flavor, the entire brew really come together and provide quite the drinking experience."
"Drinkability: the aftertaste leaves you wanting more and before you know your glass will be empty"
"D: Hops are a little harsh, but it's not too sweet & the alcohol is subtle. The way a DIPA should be?"
"I think this beer basically boils down to the earthy bitterness and overall pine flavor that surrounds it. To be honest, I can't see why this is so hyped. Maybe it's a west coast thing. It's a very good beer, absolutely. Probably one of the best DIPAs I've had. In the end, however, even as I try to distance myself from the hype surrounding this beer (especially since I don't get to try many hyped beers), this is not one of the beers that gets under my skin and makes me love beer. But it is a damn fine one."
"Overall the top DIPA of everything I've tried so far. I'm glad I was able to obtain a few fresh bottles so I can enjoy this beer more then once. Some day I hope to get to the area so I can try on tap. All acolades are well deserved for this one."
"Overall, all I can say is I wish I had regular access to this beer. Just awesome stuff. In all honesty, probably not my favorite IPA, but Top 3 for sure. Excellent stuff. I'll be moving to the West Coast after I graduate, thats for sure."
"From notes. Clear, copper, active, thick foamy head lasts and lasts, patchy lacing. SMELL is piny, citrus, floral and sweet. Complex, and with long legs and a hint of heat. TASTE floral and citrusy hops first, malty sweetness emerges and balances, followed by sharp citrusy hops and bitterness, which fades into the finish and then lingers a bit. FEEL pleasant medium bodied texture, slight lingering bitterness. OVERALL very flavorful, not too filling, well hidden alc. But still a sipper."
"D - This is a flavorful beer but it's still very easy to drink. I've enjoyed many, many Plinys in the last year and the love has only grown. If I had to pick one beer for life, it would likely be this one."
"Taste/Body: Nice light body allows the hops to do their job. Good amount of carbonation. Fits the style. First taste is of citrus and citrusy hops. Not sweet, but citrus. Malt creeps in right in the middle. Oh, how its beautiful on the tongue! Finishes with the earthy piney hops that you know are there and are just waiting for them to kick you! Finishes pretty dry, little to no residual sugar or dextrins, but that could be masked by the long lingering hop bomb thats going off in your mouth. Warms my face as I drink, so I notice the alcohol heat immediately, I like! I dont pick up any characteristics from the yeast. Very clean. Hops, some malt, hops, alcohol, then more hops!"
"A masterpiece of a beer. It poured a tawny copper color with a nice fluffy white head. Hopalicious aroma. A distinct pine and grapefruit aroma. The taste has a decidedly balanced flavor for such a hop monster. Nice breadiness compliments the grapefruit flavor from the hops. A nice medium body with average carbonation. The absoulte most drinkable IIPA in existence and one of the ONLY beers that ever has lived up to the hype."
"D- As mentioned before, this is a fantastic IPA, perhaps the best on the market. Would drink this beer every day if I could."
"-best 2 IPA out there as far as i know. this beer doesnt seem fair and i was thinking coming in that it couldnt be thaat good, but it is"
"Drinkability: This beer definitely lived up to the hype, in my humble opinion. Its sub-$5 price point makes this beer a steal (if only we could get it out here)! The 8% ABV is well-hidden, but then again, most everything is well done with this beer. After tasting this brew, one gets the impression that nothing was accidental with this beer. I, for one, am thankful that Russian River and Saul gave me the opportunity to try this beer. Thanks guys!"
"Drinkability: Could crush this all day. One begs to be followed with another. - difficult to do when you're in OHIO, but this is easily the most drinkable top 50 beer out there IMO. It's sooo good - must trade for more soon!!"
"I liked the Sculpin I had before this, but Pliny is still ahead of it in my opinion for IPA/DIPA. I believe Pliny is the standard for a West Coast DIPA. It very well deserves the title in my eyes."
"Is it worth the hype? Yea, probably most of the hype. I've had other DIPA's and regular IPA's that I've enjoyed more, that are cheaper, but I would certainly never turn down a Pliny."
"What an excellent piece of work. Glad I got to have this in a bottle and on draft at the brewpub. I can think of no better way to conclude a day that ends in 'y'. Maybe one day this'll make to Virginia. Until then, its California dreamin'."
"D-- A true pleasure to drink. If it were as pricey as it is, i would drink a trough of it. Extremely drinkable even at 8.0% abv."
"This DIPA is very balanced. The malts are present, but aren't cloyingly sweet like other examples of the style. The hops are present, but their main contribution is a nice finishing flavor and wonderful lingering bitterness."
"If I've has a better IPA before, I can't remember when."
"D: Absolutely cannot get enough of Pliny. Unquestionably one of my top 5 favorite beers, if not my favorite. As much as I'm enjoying this beer, I'm sad that it's the last one. Even knowing that, it's hard to take it slow with this beer- it goes down so smooth it's gone before you know it. I either need to take a trip to CA, ask my cousin to come visit again, or start trading. Actually, all three sound like good options."
"The drinkability is good, as good as a DIPA could be. I could drink this all day long."
"D: Very easy to drink. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. This is simply the best DIPA I have ever tasted. I just wish I had some more."
"Seriously, though, this is a world-class beer."
"D-- The most drinkable IPA I've ever had the pleasure of DOWNING. I couldn't help but drink it faster than Paul Revere's steed."
"Drink Pliny every chance you get. Cheers."
"D-- My first Pliny and I admit I am not a DIPA fan but this is a good beer and drinkable. Like how well balanced it is on the hops and the citrus. Could easily drink 2 of these and be happy."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers. Its one of, if not the BEST DIPA on the market. Only other honoarable mentions would be PTY, sculpin and hopslam. I enjoy this brew every time I trade for it with goodspeed94, he hooks me up. Hope its bottled and sold in pa soon. Highly recommended."
"All in all it goes slightly ahead of Dreadnaught and Founders Double Trouble as the best DIPA i've had."
"This beer deserves its accolades. It really is one of the best!"
"Cheers to a certain mail order beer company who sticks it to the man & will ship to PA! 8/19/09 batch. Pours with a big head which settles slowly. Color is a bit light for a DIPA. Smells & tastes of citrus & pine hops and not much else. Mouthfeel is smooth considering the hoppiness. An 8% ABV helps make this very drinkable for the style. A huge DIPA which is worth seeking if you are a hop head. I have had this on draft many times & it is just as good in a bottle. One of my favorite beers, period."
"The only downside for me is the extreme hoppiness that prevents me from wanting to drink another glass. For what is described as a double IPA I would expect a little more malt flavor to come through and help balance out the fresh hop bitterness."
"Very drinkable. No problem putting this back and the alcohol was well hidden. Very tasty as well, I look forward to many more next year when I move back to Cali."
"So this is the Pliny I've heard so much about. And it lives up to its billing. Like so many DIPAs, it is powerfully hoppy. Unlike most DIPAs it manages to be both floral and bitter in well-balanced combination. It is easy on the eyes and complex on the nose and tongue. Certainly a superior DIPA."
"If more DIPA's were like this I would drink them more often. There is a huge hop flavor, but it is not just bitterness. For an admit malt head this is very enjoyable. If that is not a great endorsement for this beer, I don't know what is?"
"M/D: Stuffed to the brim with sticky hops, this beer is clean and crisp. It has a lighter texture and feel than most DIPAs, and this makes is supremely enjoyable and refreshing. The bitterness makes my mouth pucker as I sip, but the smooth finish really rounds out this beer nicely. The fruity component adds a layer of complexity that I was not expecting. I am a big fan."
"Overall: Well, I have to say, that at first I thought this was truly one of the best beers I ever had. But after 4 sips, I had to drink water to clean my taste buds and re-hydrate my mouth. This ritual I had to repeat the whole time. This beer is so bitter (which is great), but it makes the mouth dry and insensitive for any other taste (and apparently I'm not the only user that thinks so recently). What a pity, because a beer should also be drinkable. I think the drinkability is highly overrated, the taste, for sure not. It feels a bit strange this beer is rated higher than Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 8 on Beeradvocate, I personally think that the ratebeer.com rating reflects the quality of this beer better. But still, worth to try? YES! if I drink it again....? well, I still have one bottle left...."
"A friend of mine bought be seven bottles of this. What a good friend. This review is from the last bottle I have left. Poured the bottle of into a Duvel tulip glass. Leaves a nice foamy white head that lingers for quite a while. Lots of lacing on the glass. The color is a light orange shade and very cloudy. Tiny bubbles work their way up the glass. I could smell this beer when I opened the bottle. Wonderfully strong in the nose. Lots of hoppy aroma. Noticeable citrus and pine presence in the aroma. The taste is much the same. Absolutely delicious. Big hoppy bite, followed by a strong grapefruit taste...almost tastes like a grapefruit rind was dropped in. A fair amount of bitterness but not overpowering. A real lip smacker. Very strong taste and nicely balanced. Medium body and not a lot of mouth stick. It's got an almost """oily""" mouthfeel to it and it makes me want to chatter my teeth. This is real easy to drink, but I need to sip this and savor it. Who knows when I'll get more Pliny. I had high expectations and those were certainly met. Pliny is a fantastic beer."
"Update: Turns out that I was indeed having an allergic reaction, but not to the beer. Since this review I have had Pliny on numerous occasions and must say that it truly is an exceptional beer. Wonderful balance, great undertones, and not overly dry by any means. I have thus updated the rating."
"D: Being very impressed by smell/taste initially, somewhere half through my glass I feel my mouth drying out and the bitterness taking hold of all my papilla. To keep enjoying this beer, I went to rinse my mouth with water a few times. This left me in doubt about trying this beer again."
"Drinkability: Russian River, please start distributing to Wisconsin. This is a beer I could have multiple of. A fantastically brewed beer by RR. This was the first PtE I had, and the first beer from RR. I'll be asking for this in a trade many times in the future."
"The label is no joke: DO NOT AGE! I can't think of any other beer where freshness makes such a dramatic difference."
"This is an exception DIPA, probably the best there is in terms of a fresh, grassy hop flavor and a great malt balance that never forgets that the hops are the star of the show. In a weird way, I'm almost glad I couldn't have this beer every day. Instead, I'd rather have it every year or so. Something to look forward to, no?"
"Now if I can just get my hands on PTY!"
"D - Somewhat light body really adds to the drinkability, which is almost off the charts for a DIPA."
"Pliny is the archetype and one that has influenced a myriad of stellar Double IPAs yet has managed to remain the leader of the pack. This is arguably the best Double IPA on the planet."
"Final thoughts: This is an incredible beer, as expected. I had huge hopes and it didn't smash them. Perhaps could have used a slight more malt (I'll prolly get reamed for that) but thats IMHO. The hops and flavors are so balanced that it was just amazing to keep drinking and drinking. So many different hop flavors that balance out well and come from every angle, like getting gang jumped. I can't wait to get more. It's almost as if someone juiced a grapefruit using a pine cone made of love and ecstasy. I feel like a hopped hippie after drinking this!"
"Drinkability is awesome. I found it easy to guzzle...almost too easy, as I was soon starring at an empty glass wondering what happened to possibly the greatest beer I have ever tried."
"Had this beer today and it was 3 weeks old this time. I have to go back and say that this beer changes pretty dramatically with age. This time around, this beer was pretty top notch and a really good IPA."
"I have been looking forward to getting ahold of one of these for a while. So, the question is; does it live up to the hype? Well, probably not, but it would be almost impossible for it to. It is not that this isn't an exceptional beer, it is just that there are other DIPAs that are just as exceptional. This is certainly in my top 5 for DIPAs (top 3 probably), but I think Hopslam is just a bit better."
"I love this beer, plain and simple. I have been teasing my palate with different kinds of IPA's and Imperial IPA's lately but so far, nothing has come close to the amazing explosion of smell and flavor this beer has just provided. I am prone to being disappointed when I have high expectations for something and this one of the few instances that I can say that this beer certainly lives up to its expectations, and then some. I cannot wait until I can get my hands on some Pliny the Younger in the Winter/Spring. If possible, go get this right now."
"Quite drinkable, smooth. Drink one today and drink it fresh(by the label(."
"Let me just say Pliny the Elder is a freaking experience, the beer is amazing to say the least"
"This beer is a bear, a burly beast, a hop conquistador here to take over your tongue. World-class. The 600-pound DIPA in the room."
"Overall: One of the best IIPAs I've ever had. Just another reason why it's great to live in California. Very well balanced, and amazing aroma"
"D: And it's gone...I seriously need more Pliny in my life."
"Nice crisp mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Absolutely no hint of the alcohol. This one is a treat! I wish I lived in California..."
"Me and the Senators went out to mourn the poor bastage's passing after his whole """blown-up-by-a-volcano""" thing. Luckily this beer is taking the edge off that harsh. Pours a orangy, amber with pillowy head, smelling of tangy citrus hops. Tastes of crisp fresh citrus hops with just the right amount of carb. As Pliny used to say, fortune favors the brave, so with that, I crack my 6th. Salud!"
"Had it on tap in a local beer bar in Folsom CA, it's was a wonderful experience. First glance, pour very cloudy with murky yellow. The smell was very extremely present, it went down quite nicely and it was very smooth. The Elder is a well balanced beer, world class beer."
"Pours a deep gold with peach highlights. A finger of head displays thick bubbles. The aroma is bursting with hop goodness--tons of grapefuit and pine. First taste is all grapefruit, and then that west coast bittterness, drying pine, fruity sweetness, some alcohol, melon. It definitely coats the tongue and finishes long and dry. Not sure that I would want to drink more than one 500ml bottle in one sitting, as it is so satisfying and flavorful, but it would be a regular treat if I had the access. No wonder Russian River can't keep up with demand!"
"For my second bottle of Pliny, I decided to do a head to head taste test with another of my favorites to get a really good feel for this brew. I chose a Two Hearted Ale. I did a blind taste test. The Pliny was much cloudier in appearance, and the smell was far more dramatic. The hop fragrance lept out of the glass. It had more depth and body, and was the smoother beer overall. I love the Two Hearted, but it was a bit thin in comparison (I guessed the beers after a short time with the blind test). I also tried a bit of a HopSlam in comparison, but it is past it's prime now - too much honey, not enough hops. The Pliny is an extremely well balanced IPA, as good as any I've had. I would love to try it against an Alesmith IPA."
"First timer for Pliny the Elder, and I must say the anticipation was intense. Thanks to saulcharlseworth for the trade!! We can't get it here on the East Coast. Respect hops, consume fresh! First impression: golden nectar color, crystal clear with bright white, medium head and pleasing piney hop aroma that doesn't overpower. First sip: mmm, nice but I think it's a bit too cold - it's masking the flavor. Swirl, let it sit for a few minutes. Mmm better, more aroma and flavor coming through. Nicely balanced, medium body, about 7.5-out-of-10 on the hop-richter scale. Halfway through, smooth, balanced, simple pleasing hop profile, that's not trying too hard. Final: well made, very well balanced, 8% sneaks up on you. Wait, I don't think I tasted everything, can I have another? Nutshell: fabulous as an IPA, but only great as a DIPA/Imperial."
"Poured from a bottle dated 7/06/09, a vigorous pour resulted in about two and a half fingers of thin white head above a dark golden brew... In my opinion, this is what a IPA/double IPA should look like. Not too heavy on the dark malt to let the excellent hop character be the center of attention. Smell is of canned pineapple and grapefruit, with a little grassiness thrown in for good measure. A truly amazing smelling beer. Taste is similar to the smell, with pineapple coming in a slight bit less then the smell would have led me on to think. Lots of citrus and grassy flavor with just enough malt. As it warms the alcohol starts to lend itself to the flavor a little more. Mouthfeel is light yet not watery, with the hops being the dominant player here rather then having a sweet sticky mouthfeel from too much malt. Drinkability is good but not amazing. I really like this beer overall, but usually after 500ml I am ready to move on to something else. Overall this is an exceptional beer with only a few serious rivals in the best DIPA category."
"Wow is this a great balanced DIPA and the alcohol being just a hint lower is nice to. Can easily drink a whole bottle by ones self. Had little 2 oz. tastings before, but this is the first substantial quantity I've had and it does not disappoint."
"Bottle pours a clear golden color with a nice frothy white head. Has a real nice aroma to it. It reminds me of pine and citrus right away. The mouthfeel is medium and leads into a great upfront citrus blast. That leads to a great caramel malt flavor that finishes with a pine flavor. Overall this is a really nice brew. I am not sure how they managed to avoid hop haze with this one. It was so clear. Good stuff."
"It packs an alcohol punch, but it's a mellow punch. It's like getting whacked hard with a pillow. At 8%, I could drink a couple of these. They are so tasty that I just might do so."
"drinkability is decent. the sheer level of hops found here make this a huge DIPA with tons of hops and a bitter profile. the composition is well put together and fresh. an excellent brew. another solid example from Russian River. cheers!"
"The first thing I notice is the mouthfeel, very full and thick, it's great. Got some really nice toasty notes sticking around at the end as well. Taste is really great as well. Got a lot of nice hoppiness to it, very complex with lots of really complex and interesting flavors. every sip is giving me more and more. Excellent beer. Seek this out... incase you weren't already."
"Fluffy mouthfeel with billowing carbonation is pleasant, and the after effects suck all the moisture out of the mouth leaving it sticky and dry. I'm not feeling a ton of drinkability tonight though. One will be enough."
"Mouthfeel was tangy and smooth, great carbonation. This was very refreshing and well worth the wait. I am glad I have more in the fridge."
"Overall: The thing about this beer isn't that it's the highest abv or most hoppy, but I think its the perfect balance of it all. You could drink it all day(which I kind of have) and it doesn't get old. It's the kind of beer where if you see it for sale in a store you just have to pick up a bottle. Whether its for personal consumption or to trade, its always a great beer to have on hand. Slightly better on tap than bottled, but freshness is key."
"D - For hop lovers like me, easy to lift and swill and appreciate sip after sip until, sadly, it is gone and -- if one is lucky -- it's time for another. Drinkability for the style is marvelous, but the assault of hops and sharp, bitter, alcohol presence on the tongue means this is a palate-bruiser of a beer."
"This was my first Pliny (of any generation) and it was delicious. I am still growing into my appreciation for Imperial IPAs, but this was a darn good place to start."
"Highly rated or hyped beers usually do not score as high for me but this one is one very well crafted beer."
"Sweet, bright, crisp, bitter and well-balanced. One of the best of the style."
"Alot of people probably couldnt or wouldnt want to but I could drink this every day."
"Mouthfeel is oily and decently carbonated with a long lasting aftertaste. Drinks easy but the taste makes you sip every last drop slowly."
"Unbelievable. I mean incredible."
"D- Pretty good even for an 8% ABV beer."
"Cloudy, light orange color. Medium off white head. Strong hop/grapefruit aroma. Strong hop flavor with light pine. Long duration. Slick texture. Bitter, ligth astringent finish. Moderate carbonation. Fair lacing."
"This beer in the top 50 beers is beyond laughable and 100% completely due to ignorance. Learn to brew and this is not a hard beer to duplicate or even improve. Try brewing an authentic world class Belgian quad."
"The taste is very smooth and the bitter IPA ending is the best and most memorable I've had. It begs you have more and experience it again and again. Its so resfreshing and rewarding, simply one of the best I've had."
"D-I had this beer on a West Coast trip and heard for years how beer geeks worship this brew. I can honestly tell you that this beer abosolutely lives up to the hype. I hope to have this brew again."
"What a great beer! Although after reading the label, I think it might be somewhat preferable to drink this one as fresh as possible. So glad I finally got to try it."
"Its almost a bittersweet feeling having this beer. I'm estatic that I was finally able to have this beer, and not in some lame 4oz. pour, but a whole growler of it. But now I don't know when the next time ill have this beer, maybe thats what makes it so good. Did it live up to the hype/anticipation, I think so. I also think that perfect beer is still out there and that is why we seek out beers"
"D - Alcohol is there, but never plays a large role in flavor, scent, nor effect. Certainly one of the better DIPAs I've ever tasted. A must try. Glad they are shipping these to Colorado now!"
"Decent, but not really my favorite IPA. Aroma is the balls and is why I score it so high, but the flavor doesn't deliver. Sorry."
"An exceptional beer, indeed. though I was not taken aback like many others, I cannot deny the excellence of this beer, but that certain would make it even better."
"There is a quality character to this hoppy brew and it there is no question but that it is out of balance with hops. It's great! I love it. More brewers should make out of balance, hop heavy brews like this one! A winner, especially on tap. Very food friendly with flavorful dishes."
"D: This beer could go down way to fast. The alcohol is masked completely and you would never guess this beer was 8%. I am sipping this beer slowly knowing that it may be a long while before I get another chance to taste this exceptional beer."
"D: This beer is amazingly drinkable, goes down super smooth and a great hop bomb with the pine and the grapefruit flavors, if you can find this beer very fresh (less than a month old) pick it up and drink it. Will buy this over and over again."
"Tasty, tasty tasty. There is lots of bitterness but it doesn't overwhelm and it just works really well. Yes, this beer is really hyped but it is very drinkable for its ABV and is very good."
"D - Very drinkable beer, not for those (like myself) who aren't huge hops fans, but you can definately appreciate how well this is put together. A very complex, impressive contribution from RR."
"This beer is to say the least, most excellent. Were it readily available to me, I could perhaps see myself taking to one of these on occasion--but nothing more. I like my hops bombs just like anyone else, but this is one of those beers that makes you stop tasting anything else after drinking it."
"Believe the hype!! A little bitter at first but do yourself a favor and let it warm up and settle down and all the hidden goodness comes out."
"Overall the tap version didn't really have a lot to offer that the bottle didn't, though I'm certainly not complaining as either is a great choice."
"Had this as part of a tasting session with a buddy a while back. Finally had this wonderful brew! Wanted so badly to review it poorly, but it really does live up to it's hype. Poured golden in color with frothy white head that left good lacing. Smelled very hoppy, with caramel malts and citrus fruit. Tasted the same. Incredibly smooth. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs now."
"Pliny the Elder didn't quite live up to all the hype, but it certainly didn't come off as anything but excellent; it's a really well done beer, and extremely drinkable, but seems more like a big IPA than a double IPA."
"D- Incredible drinkability that goes down so smooth, clean and won't let you down. You could tear through a keg of this pretty quickly and get your lupulin addict fix."
"Deep golden, but poured with no head. Clear with some carbonation. Aroma of citrus and pine which was also present in the in the first taste. Medium mouthfeel with some bite from the carbonation which was maintained through the finish. Not as over-the-top as some DIPAs. Well balanced."
"Drinkability - Enormously drinkable. This beer continues to blow me away. They hide the higher abv perfectly, and this beer keeps me calling back for more and more. If I didn't have to drive tonight I would sit here and enjoy the other two I purchased! This brew makes me happy I live on the west coast and have easy access to it. This is what an IPA should be."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew but its not something that i would seek out again"
"D- I have had quite a few IPA/DIPAs and I can say without a doubt that this was my favorite. Awesome flavor and aroma and superior drinkability for a brew of this style."
"D: Sure, i'll have another. In fact i had 5, dint realize the ABVs until it was too late!"
"It's a hop bomb. A pretty good one too. Very little complexity or depth of flavor. Just a really hoppy beer. I'd certainly drink it any time but it's not worth the Herculian effort to obtain or all of the endless praise. There are quite a few IIPA's I'd MUCH rather have."
"Bottle from My Secret Santa, thx santa. Pours a hazy orange gold with a good lasting off white head. The head is foamy and laces well. Has a good hoppy aroma of citrus, and musty pine. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. The taste is great. More thin than thick but a great mix. Has a super bitterness too it but is so well balanced it works great. Alcohol is hidden very well. The texture is thin as I said earlier. Has a great finish and the perfect aftertaste. This is just one awesome beer. Has a medium body. I would drink this anytime anywhere I love this beer."
"For the rest of my comments read any A or A+ review below."
"This is about as drinkable as a DIPA gets. The 8 percent ABV doesn't become apparent until the very end."
"This is in my Top 10 brews of all time."
"Pliny the Elder would be proud to have this beer named for him. The pour was coppery and clear with a nice white head. The hop aroma was distinct and pleasant. The first taste was all I had hoped it would be after reading so much about this brew. Hops, hops and more hops. A good clean finish with just enough lingering to please a true hop head."
"Tastes better and better as it warms up with the fruitiness coming through in full effect."
"Drinkability is a problem for me, however. (What is it with me and drinkability?) If all you're drinking is IPA's and DIPA's, it shouldn't be a problem. Otherwise, you should save this for the end of a session. The hops really do linger in the mouth, and could overwhelm subsequent beers. But maybe food and/or water woulf take care of that."
"Amber pour with a very thin white head. Pine and citrus hops as well as a bit of honey in the aroma. Flavor is pine hops, herb, caramel, toffee. The malt backbone is just barely hinted at in this one. Finised very bitter, dry. Good carbonation on the newer samples that I've had."
"D: This beer is a bit of a slow go for me. However, I think it is because it is so amazing that I want to savor every drop."
"Gotta have it fresh, you should have all IPAs as fresh as possible, Pliny is the master."
"This is one hell of a beer, I wish I could drink it every day."
"d - incredibly easy to drink. the smoothest dipa i've ever had."
"Ranked #6 Top Beer in America, and #2 American Double / Imperial IPA when I tried it. (My highest ranked beer so far)"
"The taste holds up to expectations. Looking for a some sort of flaw with this beer, I do think it's a little hopped up. I know, I know--it's named after Mr. Hop--but if you were to hand me this beer in a glass, me knowing nothing about it, I would comment on a subtle chalkiness attributable to the hop. Though I taste more lemon than I smelled, I would appreciate some more. The earthy, hoppy mouthfeel pulls more at my tongue and cheeks than it does at my teeth, and that's unusual. Perhaps I'm losing that sensation, but I expected more of that from this Pliny. It's 3,000 miles away and probably has to suffer some sorta despair on its undistributed route here. The raw power of the hop, however, shant go unrecognized. It's a great beer, and I wish I could partake more regularly."
"D: Worth every bit of the hype. Absolutely world class!"
"One more edit: after having them side by side I realized that Pliny packs a huge punch. It brings a ton of flavor and has a much larger body compared to blind pig. I am glad I had both of them side by side so I could realize this. It makes blind pig taste so like and almost watery."
"EDIT: Had this again the past weekend in S.F. both at the Toronado and in bottles. The bottles were only one week old, thus me changing me review of the taste to a perfect 5. One of my favorite beers ever."
"D- drinkability could be no less than a 5. could it be more? if only they allowed for it..."
"Final verdict: nice, but I'll stick with 90 Minute or Torpedo for my double IPAs."
"Drinkability: This is very drinkable. I kept wanting another sip. I would have had second one if time permitted, I'll drink this again in the future."
"Acquired thanks to a trade with goodbyeohio. Pours a thinly veiled gold with two fingers of fluffy white head that creates some nice lacing as it dissipates. The relatively plain appearance does little to signal what lies ahead (call it the Clark Kent of DIPAs). The smell is mango and pineapple with some light pine and vanilla underneath. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a DIPA with lively carbonation that helps convey a variety of hop flavors without ever feeling too heavy. Not as much malt balance as some may like: a pleasant but brief vanilla/mango sweetness at the beginning is quickly dispensed with as the hop show begins. However, Pliny is not a blindly flailing hop jambouree either; there is some subtlety underneath the brawn. When the sweetness fades, the grapefruit hop flavors come in, providing a delicate transition before the stronger pine notes treat your tonsils like a boxer's speed-bag. The finish gives a delayed dry smack to the back of the throat and then a prolonged hop aftertaste that contains only a hint of the 8% alcohol. Very drinkable for a beer this flavorful: despite its complexity and intensity, the mouthfeel keeps Pliny a lively elder. Pairs nicely with sweet & spicy BBQ."
"On the palate a huge hop bite then a small taste of maltiness with little to no sweetness then back again with a huge hop bitterness, this beer isn't about malt it's all about hops and it doesn't let you forget it. The bitterness stays with you and prevents you from drinking anything else but another Pliny and that's not a bad thing!"
"Now I will be honest, at first, I thought to myself 'whats the big deal""" its just another hoppy bear...' but clearly this is something else. just to be sure, i sampled the longtrail double ipa next and it was a joke compared to the pliny...now i just need to taste the younger!"
"Wonderful ale -- highly recommended."
"D: Simply put, when fresh this is the best beer I've ever had. The only negative with it is its shelf-life. If you don't drink it within 2 weeks of bottling, you aren't getting the full experience. That is a tragedy."
"All that said, I just updated my bottle review with a bit lower taste score. The last few bottles, dated 6/10/09, seem to have lost a bit of the hops flavor profile. Perhaps I am being harsher after having it on tap, but I hope that the increased production they are pushing has not impacted quality."
"500ml bottle. Bottled on 4/7/09. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear pale gold with two fingers of white head. Big piney hop aroma. For some reason I got a little cat piss, but hey I've got cats. It went away quickly. It wasn't as bitter as the nose would suggest. Medium bodied with a decent malt base. Long dry finish with the mouth pucker you would expect from a DIPA. Maybe could have been a bit fresher. Good beer, but I think I expected more."
"woohoo! thanks max and vinnie, for making this happen!"
"I got this beer for a birthday present yesterday, and enjoyed it. The beer was freshly shipped from Cali. It poured a yellowed copper color with a lasting head and decent lacing. The smell is mostly citrus hops with a light herbal hops in the background. The taste was amazing. Not much malts, but they're not a feature of this style--just enough to get a nice balance. Pliny the Elder was very smooth (probably the smoothest beer I've had) and had great carbonation. The only knock in drinkability is the ABV, but even that is low for the style. Excellent beer."
"500ml bottle that is two weeks old today. Pours a hazy copper with a large, substantial white head that lasts. Copious hops on the nose, with heavy citrus/grapefruit, floral, herbal, and even slightly cannabis-like notes. Very hop-forward taste as well, again with a lot of citrus and herbal qualities; really complex hop profile. Quite bitter, but still very palatable. Very light biscuity malt in the background. Medium-full body with high carbonation, which suit it well. By nature it's not something that lends itself to easy drinking, though for the style it's quite decent."
"My sister brought this back from a recent trip to the West coast. It pours a slightly hazy gold with a this head. Filtering a beer like Pliny has to be a sin so the haze is fine with me. The aroma is powerful citrusy American hops. Tons of grapefruit, and resiny pine with other citrus as well. There is some sweet pale malt in there, I can smell it if I really try, but the huge hop aroma overwhelms. Hop flavor and bitterness hit up front and alternate across my tongue. The same citrusy and resiny hops dominate as well as some pine and a bitter herbal flavor. The bitterness is so pronounced that I can feel it in my throat a bit, but the beer is still totally drinkable. Some fruity esters pop up in the finish, pairing well with the hops. This one lives up to the hype, and I would buy it regularly if it ever makes it to the East Coast."
"Good lucky finding it! i was told they don't make enough so if you see it buy it!!! i paid $7 for a pint bottle so yea try not to get ripped off. and as i find myself ending this review Im also ending this beer, Shit!! well at least i still have a lagunitas in the fridge. enjoy"
"Poured into a Tulip glass with about one inch head which fades pretty fast leaving a fair amount of lacing. Color is golden amber. Nose has a TON of hops, mainly grapefruit and pine a little floral hiding in the back. Taste is a hop explosion, being a hophead this one is truely great, fruit and piney hops galore. The beer is very well carbonated giving a nice slick and crisp feeling heading down the pipe. This would be a desert island beer for me, i could drink it forever."
"Overall a world class beer. I now understand the hype and it lives up to the billing."
"Definitely the best beer I've had to this point."
"This one tasty beer. I don't want it all the time, but it is just so terrific at the right moment. I brought a few bottles with me from LA a few months ago. Also, I appreciate the label stressing to drink this beer fresh. It is really important."
"I've heard (read) the hype. I'm a believer. I have a few bottles if someone in a far-off land would like to trade."
"D - This is the easiest drinking imperial/DIPA I have ever had."
"CARBONATION & ALCOHOL: Just right. The booze and alcohol are perfect for the flavor of the beer. They really do a great job at Russian River. Hard to beat this one. I've been trying."
"Love it, love, love it. Like everyone said. The perfect balance of hops and malt that isn't too much of anything. Not too hot, not too hoppy, nothing. Just perfection. I've had it on tap and in bottles. The best part is that it also travels well. I've had this shipped to me in new york from the west coast several times and never had a problem."
"Maybe I need this one on-tap. Appearance is very good nice head- looks very oily and fun. Smell is nice with some decent fruitiness.Good firm blast of hops with decent amount of bitternes detected. The tasted is a bit weaker- seems like this has lost a bit of hoppiness- I want it on tap. Mouthfeel is very good. Lots of oily and maltiness. Drinkability is very good."
"Way too easy to drink for a beer at 8% abv."
"i could drink this everyday and a shit ton of it at that"
"this is so drinkable. i do believe this beer for its style really deserves the rating it has obtained. very smooth"
"bottled on 4.29.09. golden orange, slight haze, nice creamy white head and lacing. incredible floral notes dominate the nose with some honey, citrus, grassy and tropical fruit notes underneath. lemony, sharp but not harsh bitterness overpowers the very light sweetness of the biscuity malts. seems almost completely dry/attenuated. body is on the light side of medium, nicely carbonated, with a spritzy/prickly mouthfeel. long hoppy bitter finish with some aspirin-like astringency. thanks to natasharai for this one."
"Thanks again to RichBeer for the hook-up on this bomb beer!"
"Overall a good, solid IPA that I enjoyed, but found not worthy of it's place among the immortals in the heavens. A couple other thoughts. I had several of these over the course of a week so this review reflects the combined experience, not a single glass. I thought that 8% was a little on the low side for an Imperial IPA, Hop rod Rye is also 8% and considered a standard IPA, and in my opinion a much better beer. The beer may have suffered in my eyes due it's reputation, but I did not think this was the 7th best beer in the world as the rankings here show."
"Drink ability is good for such a high abv. Hops dominate the beer but are not over powering. I need to buy a bottle of this and try it again as I thought it was good but not amazing as many people claim it to be"
"Comes highly recommended, as the reviews would imply."
"This is an excellent DIPA. If only it were easier for me to get."
"Had this on tap at the Bier Stein a few times as well as in a bottle. It tends to taste differently each time I have it on tap which is weird. Served nice and chilly with a white bubbly, foamy head. Great smell of floral and fruity hops. Clear and deep golden with an amber color. The taste is great, but can change depending on when/where you have it. The best I've had was actually from the bottle - a great refreshing taste of strong floral hops up front, then the fruity hops hit your palate, followed by just the slightest hint of well-covered, crisp alcohol. Very refreshing and drinkable for a double IPA."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Ironically this is not my favorite of beer but happens to be my first review. I am now a fan!"
"M/D - Medium body with a rough texture due to high carbonation and finishes very dry. Easy to drink, not too heavy but the alcohol sets in quicker than expected."
"D - A fantastic Imperial IPA any way you slice it. The originator and the one that sets the standard for the west coast style w/ great drinkability - worth any hype -this gives hops the glory"
"I could drink a lot of these slowly, Great bottle with a unique taste !!!"
"I have to say that I am just a little bit disappointed. I know there is a huge debate about this so take it for what it is worth, but I would have liked some other flavors to be present here balancing (somewhat) the hops taste. I like the complex character of 90 minute, Double Crooked Tree, and Hopslam too much to really think this is wonderful."
"Pours a moderate one finger head of off-white, mixed bubble size foam, some stickiness to the lacing whereas the head mostly gone in about a minute or so. Light golden-yellow in color with a metallic orange tinge which brightens more than darkens, comes extremely close to transparency. There's a certain bluntness to the nose, like it kicks there door open and then just stands there unmoving in the door way, thick pink to white grapefruit, tangerine citrus notes resonant yet not juicy nor zesty per se, in turn the floral notes more citrus blossom than well-rounded """musk""" and the peach, nectarine, pineapple, papaya fruit scents present more thrust than expansiveness, not insanely hoppy nor grassy but sufficient enough to put any malty scents way in the background. Medium-bodied, too tightly wound as well as aggressively carbonated to really get full-bodied. Peppery mouth entry, quite spicy, forestalls the grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus component for a tick or two. Pine resin clearer here, florality a little more hidden. Doesn't come off as that dry, hence more juice in the peach, nectarine, mango fruit and less tropical bite. Sweet tea leaf oils accrue with time and at the very end you can tease out some cocoa powder. Can't say it's not balanced but when you don't risk many agile dance moves, hard not to be. (Bottled 04/07/09)"
"Overall a world class IPA. Always best fresh. Wish I could buy it in Arizona, maybe someday..."
"D: I had five of them before/during the hockey game, it was all I wanted to drink. Dangerously drinkable."
"M - Almost perfect in terms of carbonation and the feeling I get in the finish - it has a nice sour/bitter finish with just a little warming from the ABV."
"WOW, what a great beer! Poured into a La Fin Du Monde tulip, it was a really nice golden color with a short tight head. Two weeks old and it was very fresh, hoppy, citrusy, piney & crisp. Very easy to drink. Carbonation was the perfect amount. This is easily my new favorite IIPA/DIPA. Great job RR. Now I need to get more shipped to NJ!"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly high for a DIPA. Doesn't drink so difficultly, but definitely puts the heat in the system quickly."
"The flavor is complex, you get some pine from the hop still, a little malt but mostly hop. This is a great beer for a hop head, I can find nothing to dislike about this beer."
"Well done, guys. Well done."
"Very good beer and very drinkable. I will definitely be getting this any chance I get! Haven't found it in AZ yet though."
"A good tasting DIPA although I can't help but be a bit disappointed considering the massive hype around it."
"Drinkability for a DIPA is quite high, as the aforementioned balance keeps you coming back for more."
"Overall, one of the better IIPA's I've had, though not the best. Overwhelming citrus taste, but lacking the complexity I expected. However, I would drink, refill, and drink again."
"Okay, what a fantastic surprise to see this bottle sitting right in front of me for all to share last night at our beer festival meeting. It took all the power in the world to pay attention and not crack this one open right away. An hour into, however . . . it was very good, but honestly, not the best Imperial IPA I've tried. Yes, loads of citrus hops that were fantastic to the nose and tastebuds, but this beer's reputation was a little higher than what got. Still would love to get my hands on more, however."
"I can honestly say negative to both counts, as this is beer lives up to it's name, and shows us why we rate beers, which is so we can explore our doubts, work through our skepticism and hopefully realize what each unique beer means to us good or bad."
"I must admit, I was somewhat expecting this beer to be overhyped, but overall, it is really just VERY well done. My first experience with Russian River, and certainly won't be my last."
"cheers russian river"
"Had on tap at the RR Brewpub in Santa Rosa. While not quite up to the standard of its Younger nephew, a damn fine beer. Like the Younger, poured to a light orange-amber color, with thin white head and good lacing. The nose and taste, while a little subdues than PTY, were still strongly citrus hops with a hint of floral, as well as alcohol kicking in at mid-glass. Mouthfeel was dry and bitter, all rounding to a long, somewhat bittersweet finish."
"Rock on West Coast!"
"I'm a believer. Pliny is as good as they say."
"D - The hype is very well-justified on this beer. This is an absolute joy to drink. I would say that this is the best IPA I've ever tried, and maybe even the best beer I've ever tasted. I'm so glad that I finally was able to try this beer - do yourself a favor, and get your hands on a bottle! I can't imagine pairing this beer with anything; it is so exciting and extraordinary that it stands on its own."
"A sharpsmooth paradigm - the hops have a bit of a bite, but an oily smoothness at the end. Crisp, piny, and delightful. I could have a few but not too many in one sitting."
"An excellent beer. Wish it were easier to get out here in NYC."
"incredible and worth trying for anyone that would ever like to drink a beer at all in a lifetime."
"Overall a great beer, been away from the hops for a while through the winter but this one hooks me right back in. Would recommend most definitely."
"Drinkability- It's delicious, but one is definitely enough for a sitting."
"Drinkability: Luckily for me the only place that I can find it near me is relatively far away. If not I may become more of a drunkard. Excellent brew worthy of the hype."
"Edit: Would like to go back and renege on my """expensive""" comment. I think maybe the place I found it at last was dillweeding the prices. Surprisingly cheap whenever I've had it since."
"D- absolutely on my drink again list."
"This beer is delicious, but I wouldn't say it is much better than fresh Stone IPA...definitely not 3X as good."
"this is a beer to savor if it only makes brief appearances at you local beer bar...being on the east coast we rarely see this beer so i try and make the best of it when it comes around"
"Somewhat hazy, pale orange color. Small tight head on top and a great deal of lacing as it goes on down the glass. Huge flowery aroma-just screams hops. Resiny grapefruit smell. Big blast of hops up front-bitter and flowery at the same time. Sweet malt to go along with the hop blast. Great lingering bitterness. Quite the tongue blast. Good mouthfeel. A great beer flavor wise-I could do this for hours on end and not get bored. Well balanced for the IBUs that are obviuosly going on. Nice treat-I have wanted to try this for this for ages."
"Poured from the bottle with a surprisingly long lasting creamy white head layered on top a slightly hazy rich amber liquid. The nose seems to be remarkably stable given it seems as intense from the bottle I bought in Washington as it was when I drank it from the tap at Russian River. The """C"" hops are holding nothing back from the nose to the mouth as the piny citrus notes dominate everything. Given its status as a double IPA it is surprisingly uncloying with a clean lasting finish. However, the lasting impact of the hops on the tongue and roof of my mouth gets it a slight ding for drinkability. As well, this is one I will only drink one of at a time and have my hop needs met, no need for seconds tonight. Overrall the best double IPA I have ever had and will regularly revisit as long as I can find it at my local store."
"D. Delicous! I was skeptical of all the hype, but I have to say it delivered 100%. This is a great beer. I have to agree that this is pretty definitive for the style IMHO."
"D- One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Looking to get my mitts on another very soon."
"the is the DIPA of all DIPA's others need to take note from this..."
"Very, very drinkable. No alcohol presence in this IPA and I feel like I could chug this beer all day long, an awesome example of an IPA that I hope to drink more of in the future."
"And now, Pliny the Elder has preached to me the good word of the hop, and I'm sold. Every bit of hyperbole this beer has garnered is well deserved. Revel in its glory."
"overrated. have been waiting to find this beer for a while now, and when i got it, wasn't special. boring color, no head, the hops caused an imbalance of taste. had alot better balanced ipas in vancouver. hopefully plindy the younger tastes better when I come around to actually find it, but this time i won't be so hyped to try it."
"Wow...this is an amazing beer. Gotta find a way to get a steady supply here in MA."
"8% is a little too much for me to have more than a few, so this is a good ale to enjoy."
"Drinkability- I love everything about this beer. Great balance."
"This Famed Double IPA really deserves all the hype. This beer is truly one in a million! Now on to the review. 500ml bottle poured into my trusty Duvel Tulip.(bottled on 4/07/09) As soon as I opened the bottle the citrus and pine smells were apparent. Tastes were grapefruit up front, followed by more citrus notes and pine of course. Very, very smooth for a double IPA. I could live with just this beer for the rest of my life. Simply incredible!!! Double IPA is my favorite style and this is at the very top of my list! I would love to try the younger when it gets to the Philly area again. The 2 hour drive would be well worth it. If ever there was a beer I would praise as perfect, this would be it! Cheers and go Find Pliny!!!"
"Medium body with a good carbonation..Could definitely drink another and another. so I will."
"Drinkability-After the big bitter hop slap the sweet malty goodness finish it off just right. I can drink this down like crazy, but be careful the 8% alcohol is no joke....Great DIPA"
"Had this beer on tap at Russian River Brewery the day after it was kegged. Perhaps the best IPA ever made (though I haven't had PTY yet). Hops were so fresh it was like eating them. This is a must-have if you're fortunate enough to be in the greater Santa Rosa area. Poured a golden yellow, great mouthfeel (like you'd want to keep it in there forever, and skip breathing)."
"What a fabulous DIPA. The Pliny The Elder pours a light golden orange with a small soft off white head. The lacing that is left behind once that head resides is very nice leaving behind fine bubbles like you just washed your glass with soap. The hop aroma hits you before you even bring the glass to your nose. Citrus and pine come through so wonderfully. The taste is what you would expect from the aroma and it being a DIPA. Lots of great bite from the hops with a slight sweetness to wash it all away. It is light with a ton of complex flavors... just makes you smile. This is the nectar of the gods. I could drink this all night and still want more."
"Drinkability: my first DIPA...possibly could have another, but still getting used to IPA's/DIPA's"
"The hoplover will relish this one but if you're not into the style I can see why some see it as too much."
"D: Great showing for a Imperial IPA, can't go wrong with it"
"As others have said """a showcase for hops.""""
"Russian River I am angry that I can't get you in Indiana. Luckly I have college kids who come into my store that live there and bring some back for me at times. Or else I have to trade."
"D - This truly lives up to the hype. Fans of HopSlam will like the Elder, too."
"There's nothing else to say about this beer that others haven't. Damn fine beer, wonderfully crafted."
"Surely better than the tap glass I had and surely much fresher at 7 days old. I might have confused this with Pure Hoppiness, though perhaps a bit more viscous and buttery. Yet in the end good, quite good, but not great."
"Overall, a fantastic beer tastewise and in my top 5 ipas. Wish it wasn't so expensive but it's understandable. Cheers!"
"D: All around a very good beer. Absolutely cannot wait for August to get out to California and try this one on tap."
"D- Hop heads dream in a bottle. Easy drinking. I love the freshness. I think overall the bitterness is just a tad over the top."
"D: This is a powerfully hoppy brew, and one sure to destroy your taste buds with its hoppy goodness. Great brew for a hophead. I could drink 'em all the time."
"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGrandOleHopry1"
"D - easily drinkable for all occasions, especially with the relatively high ABV."
"It has a great feel to this beer. It is a fantastic brew. An IPA for the ages and it really is worth the wait."
"D: This is a no brainer. If I could get this on a regular basis I would be their biggest contributor."
"D: I love fresh Pliny. Phenomenal example of the style I would drink this beer anytime, anywhere!"
"A strange experience - I love the beer but at times I feel like I'm gnawing on a plant while walking beans back home."
"D. May be the most easliy drinking IIPA I've ever had. A truly epic beer that sets the bar for IIPAs"
"This is a great beer, and you should try it if you can. On tap if you can find it, but from the bottle it's still great."
"A fantastic beer. Im sure that when this beer is fresh it is at the absolute top."
"So smooth with medium-low carbonation. Truly a benchmark for the double IPA category."
"[Overall, having the notes to compare to there was little difference in a 3 month old bottle and a month and a half old bottle, despite what the brewery says this beer seems to hold up just fine for at least 3 months. It's close enough that I don't need to change any of the review numbers.]"
"Beer has a bottled on date of 030909. Poured into my Piraat tulip, the cloudy apple juice colored beer looks more like an unfiltered hefeweiss than an IPA. 3 cm head fades quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Nose is pure floral hops and it smells great, nothing else there that I can detect though. Taste is very smooth and perfectly balanced. Hops linger from the start to finish but are never over pronounced. Malt balances the beer throughout. Beer is light bodied and it's tough to detect the alcohol, hard to believe we're looking at 8% on this one. I feel like I could session this beer but I'm sure it would catch up to me quickly."
"D: It's all in the taste and I could sure keep on tasting this IPA."
"Bottle brewed 3/23/09. Pours a brilliant amber with frothy white head. Smell is wonderful sticky pine. Very strong smell. Taste is crisp and clean with a good amount of carbonation. It starts with a slight pepper that quickly fades to a bitter pine with some tangy grapefruit. It's the perfect hop balance, light on the peppery centenials or cascades and a hearty dose of floral varieties. There's a caramel plateau with a nice toffee crispness. The taste fades to a mellow hoppiness and leaves a very pleasent aftertaste that leaves your mouth begging for more! Extremely drinkable- an incredible IPA!!!!"
"Bottled 3/23/09. Poured into tulip glass cloudy gold with a thick white head. Very good lacing. Smell is very hoppy with good amount of floral hints. Taste isn't as hopped as I thought it would be. I've got to say I'm a little disappointed, but it's still a great taste. Mouthfeel is exceptional, alcohol content is absent which is great because it doesn't take away from the flavor the way most IIPA's do. Over all, this is a great brew, but just not the nock me off my seat great like I expected."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0903-Tim"
"Drinkability: you can't get a better beer in the style. This beer goes down easy and several pints could be had in a session. Great beer."
"I enjoy this beer A LOT. It's my last beer every time I go to RR."
"Pretty light feel with good carbonation. I could easily drink this all night if it were readily available. Just delicious."
"Drinkability? Wow. How drinkable is Pliny The Elder? Let me ask you this, my friend. How spendable is $1,000,000?"
"Brash clear golden orange. Nice thick head dissapates to a nice firm sheet of lace. Rings of stickage all the way down. Immense aroma of sappy pine needles, grapefruit, papaya, and faint sweet malts hiding in the background. Entry is much like the nose, with strong oily pine and citrus hops coating the tongue in a most pleasing manner, sticky to a degeree. Malts although present, playing a meek second fiddle. Finish is semisweet malt with orange marmalade and grapefruit fade. I would like to drink this for the remainder of the afternoon into evening, but you just can't. With the some of all it's parts, one would think this would be cloying or over the top after a while, but it's not. The alcohol is extremely well integrated here, to the point where trouble could and would come very easily if one hasn't planned out a safe way home already. Beleve the hype on this puppy. Fantastic stuff. Hate to see this last bottle go."
"This beer very much reminds me of Christmas, and I think I like it better than the Blind Pig. I will get as much of this as I possibly can, whenever I can. I'll even save it and have it less fresh, because it's still great even then. Win!"
"Drink, I would love to chug this if it didn't taste so damn good."
"A great DIPA and wirth the search"
"Drinkabilty: Hell yes. I'm not sure it's my favorite DIPA, but it's certainly up there, and is worthy of all the talk. They do a hell of a job with this. And for as complex as it is, it's too easy to drink, mostly because there's are so many things to taste and pick out. Which is, of course, awesome, and awful. Worth seeking out for sure."
"This beer has probably the fullest mouthfeel of any DIPA I've ever had. Very thick and smooth. It's pretty drinkable too; I put back the whole 16.9 oz. bottle without much trouble. Not much of an alcohol flavor, but the bitterness is a little extreme... suits me fine, though. This is a hell of a DIPA, and is definitely one my favorite beers now. Awesome. Delicious. Fantastic. A+"
"I was skeptical when I heard the hype, but it still exceeded what I had heard about it. Ridiculously well balanced beer. Recommended to anyone even people who don't drink/like hops. It's THAT good."
"Pours a beautiful amber orange with an awesome foam head. Smell is absolutely exceptional rivaling anything else I've ever had the pleasure of sniffing; citrus fruits, bread and spice are an absolute treat. The taste fulfills any and all expectations brought on by the smell, with a wonderful mandarin orange flavor and complex coriander subtleties. The beer is wonderfully smooth and feels more than good. Perhaps the best part is the way this wonderful beer isn't boozy and can be easily consumed. Its too rare and has too high of an ABV to be a session drink, but it is remarkably drinkable."
"A shot at perfection, trying to replicate some Platonic ideal built on the right type of hop, in the right proportion, with the right base of grains."
"Poured from a bottle (2/29/09) into my Duvel Tulip. Color is dark orange/gold with a very big and fluffy off-white head. Smell is outrageously awesome...pine/citrus/grapefruit all over the place...holy cow. I just want to live in it (you'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen Pineapple Express)! Taste is wonderful! So well-balanced and not overly bitter like other huge hoppy beers. Perfect amount of carbonation and so smooth it glides around in your mouth. This is a VERY drinkable beer and I could drink this beer all the time although I savor these because of my location. What an amazing beer!"
"This beer packs the punch on the flavor, no doubt about it. Huge grapefruity hop presence that finishes with a hint of burnt toast. Slight alcohol zip mixed in as well. Just an absolutey magnificent beer! This is dangerously drinkable as well. Much more so than the Younger. With the alcohol value where it is, this could do some damage for sure. I'm glad I got 3 bottles; I just need to spread them out a bit. This beer lives up to the hype."
"This beer was one of the first I ever had at Toronado SF. It completely changed my views on IPA's, and beer in general. This is my """gateway""" beer for all new potential beer advocates. It usually does the trick."
"notes- this beer really does live up to its reputation"
"Oh, I love the 500ml serving size too. I can't wait to try this on-tap at the brewery in the future..."
"This beer is not just hype, it really is as good as people say."
"D- id love to be able to try this on tap, and drink it all night long. the beer is moderately priced as well! wish i had more."
"This is the type of beer I wish I could drink everyday if it was available around me."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with medium head. Wonderful fruity hop aroma. The taste is really a surprise. It throws down a really strong piney, fruity hop flavor but finishes somewhat dryer than expected. This is a really amazing beer. Can't wait to get some more."
"D: The 8% ABV notwithstanding, this is one smooth yummy beer...yeah, that's right, I said yummy."
"D=Relatively light, though ABV would hinder drinking too many"
"Overall, this was a very good beer. I think I was a little disappointed, given the beers high ratings."
"d) can drink this all night...and have on a few occasions. i like this much better than younger imho...younger is just so rare and one of a kind...this is one of a kind on its own"
"An excellent IPA, no doubt. I love IPAs like this because I can drink them slowly and savor them for a long time. It reminds me a lot of Bells Two Hearted to be honest."
"Drinkability? This one is perfect in that column. No way you could make a more drinkable 8% beer with these kind of hop levels. Brewers take note: it isn't about bitterness and IBU's, it's about hop flavor and character. I love my syrupy DIPAs too, but this one is in a class of its own. Fantastic."
"D - This is the benchmark for a West Coast DIPA. I'm hard pressed to think of a better example. This is not for everyone though. If you're looking for sweetness and balance, this is not your beer. If you're a hop lover that thinks a DIPA should be first and foremost all about the hops, this one is for you."
"Drinkability: Not being a huge hop head, I was surprised at how mellow and drinkable this beer is. Probably my favorite of the night which was really surprising. The 8% ABV is completely hidden. I'd love to get some more of these."
"D: I'd love to have a brewery fresh bottle, but it's tough being over 3,000 miles away. I'm honored just to have tried this one. I could put this down until my face turned into a hop plant. There's alcohol here? A world class offering that lives up to the hype for sure."
"Poured a liquid goldenrod color. Decent head retention that laced down the glass for the entire experience. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and peach. Tastes just as good as it smells. Mouthfeel is excellent, perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability is through the roof."
"There isn't too much more that I can say about this beer that I haven't said already in my bottle review of it, except that it's just that much damn better on draft! One of my absolute favs and definitely my favorite hop forward beer period."
"Drinkability - Let me just say that this is a pretty good beer. I don't know if it's deserving of the top 10 accolades. I like my double IPA's to be a little bit more of a palate crusher with a bigger body and a thicker mouthfeel. This one is a little to clean and soft for an elite score. I sure as hell will never turn one down though."
"D - Refreshing to the core. This is a great beer for hop heads. You want hops, this has hops. It's just the right amount. Anymore and this beer would be oversaturated."
"I really liked this one. Anytime I'm in the area of the store that carries it, I'll pick up 5 at a time."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
" Picked up a case at the brewery in Santa Rosa on the way home to Oregon for 108 dollars, best buy I've made in ages."
"D: high drinkability, there's good flavor and no alcohol taste so I think I could drink this continuously except for when it kicks in"
"D - The Elder is certainly wiser and more accessible than its more head-strong counterpart, and boasts a fantastic drinkability that is perhaps unparalleled amongst the pantheon of DIPAs. While the aroma of the Younger was off the charts, I found Elder to be a bit more drinkable overall while still maintaining tons of hop flavor."
"A fantastic DIPA - perhaps the best I've had. I would love to try this fresh at the brewery, but thanks again to Scott for bringing back this fresh batch of bottles. A great beer worth seeking out."
"Drinking time: 3:00am Sunday morning. A good time to drink beer. First cracked open the bottle, the smell is definitely hoppy. A scent of orange and a slight scent of pine as I pour it into a Pizza Port pint glass. Golden orange appearance with tiny bubbles floating to the top. The taste is hoppy but not overwhelming. Nice aftertaste and very refreshing to my palate. 3/4 of it gone and starting to feel a nice """feeling""" from it. Mouthfeel is definitely still refreshing and hoppy as I finish drinking the Pliny. Overall, this is a very, very good beer that is definitely a top 5 on my list. The bottle is very tasty and when I can find them, I always take a few home. Starting to really feel """good""" now. Nice! Tried this on tap at Father's Office 2 in Culver City. Wow! Hard to drink the other beers on tap because Pliny just kick a--! If you find this on tap, definitely try it. I haven't been the least dissapointed so far. If you see this in bottles, you can't go wrong picking up a few home. Even the remnants at the bottom of the glass is good!"
"D- Very easy to drink. Yummy in my tummy."
"M&D - Moderate carbonation gives this beer a nice, drinkable smoothness on the palate that complements the hop bitterness very well. I could (and have) put a few of these back before the ABV caught me."
"This poured a hazy gold with a bit of off-white head. I'm surprised it wasn't darker or have any more head. It smelled more subdued than expected, like apricot and mango, with some lemon and honey. It tasted very tropical and sweet, but also very cleanly bitter. Main flavors were apricot, mango, and pineapple, supported by some resin (not really pine) and plenty of honey malt for very balanced flavor. A bit of alcohol was noticeable. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very clean and surprisingly sweet and balanced beer. Fantastic flavors with the different hops and malt playing perfectly together. Only a touch of alcohol taste made this very easy to drink. Could this have been better? Maybe a bit stronger scent and slightly fuller body. But those aren't really complaints, as this was a delight to drink."
"D--Went down very easily, a pint satisfies me plenty. Definitely a top of the line DIPA, just very balanced and easy to drink yet enough flavor and complexity to make you want to sip."
"D: Moderately drinkable at refrigerator temp. Becomes easier and easier as it warms."
"D: Easy to drink and delicious IPA. Nothing more to say than this was very enjoyable and is highly recommended."
"What a good looking beer, clear, light orange, great head that retains forever. You smell a smorgasboard of hops flavors, citrus up front, but it the piney notes that take the day and linger with you. The first taste is that bitter hop smash we all know and love but then it gets more complicated. It's the second half of the taste where the bitterness mellows and you can really appreciate the underlying flavor that makes this beer so great. The greatest aftertaste I've ever had in a beer . . . these great subtle pine notes just linger on your palate for minutes after your first taste. Has to be the best DIPA I have ever had. I am leaving some room on my score on the off-chance that I get my hands on a fresh bottle because I did think the front bitterness was slightly faded. That being said, it didn't deter my enjoyment one bit. Worth the hype. Thank you to the caring beer man in Denver who thought to keep this joy cold for my enjoyment."
"D: Despite the high ABV, I think this could be one of my top 2 beers all-time. Wish I could have shipped the beer to myself while I was out there!"
"Ok, yeah it's that good. Had literally countless pints on draught at Falling Rock in Denver as an introduction and then plenty in bottles from various stores. Brought some back and just cracked 'em last night with friends so I am reviewing the bottled version. A sharp looking beer. Super crisp and clear and light orange amber with a head that just don't quit. This beer has all aspects of hoppyness covered. Fruity, yes. Lots of citrus zest, orange, lime, and big plump pineapple juicyness. But the main flavor is pungent pine, bitter all the way through. Totally numbs my entire mouth, makes me all tingly, I like. Lingering long after the swallow too. You could take a sip of this beer and probably still taste it a minute later. I like that this IPA isn't just full of fruity hops like a lot of beers from the west coast, which can be nice, but it has that wrenching bitterness to it that really completes the bold character of the beer. Dry, yet quenching. Somehow crispy on the palate but plenty of body and just a pure pleasure to drink. I hiked a mountain in Colorado with a coupe of these in the back-pack and drank them at the top with me Lady, right outta the bottle too. That was nice."
"Wow."
"Golden colored ale with pure white head. Head dissipates into lacing that clings to the glass with each sip. The smell and taste have strong notes of grapefruit, pineapple and pine. Crisp and clean with no aftertaste. Easily the most drinkable IIPA I've ever had and at 8%, I could have a couple of liters. Looking forward to trying the Younger!"
"Poured from a chilled bottle into a room temp pint glass. Presents as a honey colored amber. A vary faint head rest atop the body. Very strong pine and flowery hop smells with the slightest hint of citrus and other fruits waft up to the nose. The taste is overpowered (in a good way for all the hopheads) by a piney/flowery hop taste. There has to be a malty backbone to supplement this hop_beast, but it is unapparent in the mouth. A medium mouthfeel, even for an IPA. Better than average, but still, I would like something a bit chewier. Overall, I could drink these all night long. Thank you russian river!"
"D - It's very drinkable. It's hopped perfectly. Enough to let you know it's there, but not so much that it gives you that unpleasant bitter pinch in the back of your jaw that a lot of hop bombs do. I'd be happy to have a case of this in my cooler!"
"Feels a little thin in the mouth wish there was just a little more there, but the carbonation is nice. I'm not getting a hint of the 8% alcohol this baby is certainly smooth. Awesome brew."
"On tap 3/19 @ Toranado. Pours cloudy amber with a a minimal white head. Medium stong aroma of pine, grapefruit, and caramelized malts. Very well balanced. Fast is similar. Extraordinarlly well balanced. One of the smoothest DIPA's I've ever had. Extremely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel with relatively low carbonation. Bitter finish with some cereal grain. Pretty f'n delicious!"
"D - I only wish I had more to drink that night or any night for that matter. The 8% is totally disguised. This DIPA is one of a kind."
"Overall, this is one of the finest beers I have ever tasted. And to put it simply, when I drink Pliny the Elder, I am happy and content like the end of a classic fairy tale. I hope everyone has an opportunity to try one!"
"The booze was not playing any tricks on me the first time i tasted this beer. It was every bit as good as i remembered it to be."
"D. A refreshing drink with uber complexity. This beer is worth the hype."
"Overall: Really drinkable for the style, almost no alcohol present, very refreshing and delicious IIPA, with good hop character!"
"D: Overall I preferred this over PTY just a personal preference as the really really strong hops taste isn't really my thing but if I ignored this and just thought of it neutrally, it was still a great beer although I can see why other would prefer PTY and think it is ambrosia from the beer gods."
"very good solid beer"
"So, Pliny the Elder on tap. What a dream for a Midwesterner. Served in a pint glass. Hazy deep copper, perfect off-white foamy head that lasts forever. Heavily carbonated. Nose is heavy resinous pine hops, fresh juniper, and mild grapefruit. Taste is heavenly hops, lingering pine, and a biscuit malt backbone. Pretty good mouthfeel and drinkability. Great IPA, but you already knew that."
"By far my favorite IPA so far. Pours a golden yellow color with a 1 1/2 finger white head, good amounts of lacing on the glass. Smells very citrusy, I even got a whiff of bannana's on the first one I drank. Taste like of grapefruit but not sour, just the sweetness of it. Thin to med bodied. This is the perfect IPA. Very drinkable. I could get into trouble with this one."
"Seek this stuff out."
"- Super drinkable... I could drink these until I fell asleep permanently. Nuff' said."
"Overall impression: A great beer, but I prefer the bottled version, at least if the tap version is served in a crappy glass. Russian River should really showcase this wonderful elixir in some proper glassware."
"T/M/D - slight carbonation, and hops everywhere on my first sip, citrusy bitter like a grapefruit, not quite as sweet as I was expecting from the smell. The hop bite is up front and the flavor stuck to my mouth for quite a while. I drank this one slowly, and it came together more after a few minutes and it warmed up a bit. Then the bite settles back a bit and I found a little maltiness in there too. Very enjoyable!"
"M/D: Medium bodied, slick on the tongue with a touch of prickly carbonation. No hint of booze. Nicely done. Drinkability is exceptional. This one could be enjoyed all night. Great beer."
"Drnkable, but at this price forget it. I gave it the highest marks i could but was expecting much much more."
"The 8% is almost non-existent. It wasn't until the very end that I got even a hint of booze. Great tropical fruit flavor, a fantastically balanced dipa."
"Overall I would say this is one of the more balanced and well made DIPA's. I really enjoy this beer and will be seeking it out again."
"Definitely a world class beer that lived up to the hype for me. Now I want to try the Younger. To top it off, it wasn't even that expensive! I'll definitely be getting this beer again. The only two detractors from drinkability for me are that it doesn't pair well with many foods, and that it's really hard to find here in Portland."
"Mouthfeel - it it balanced, smooth, almost creamy brew. Alcohol is hidden very well. It is dangerously drinkable. Great stuff!."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable! A very enjoyable experience!"
"Drinkability: It goes down extemely well. As BIG, hoppy beers go, I put this on par with with a Bell's HopSlam (as I mentioned earlier). I wish I could find and enjoy this I2PA year round locally."
"D- I am somewhat saddened by the fact that I only have 2 bottles of this. There will be many many more trades trying to acquire this from across the country. I fully understand why this is one of the elite beers. There have been recent talk about freshness and this one was bottle on 2/16/09, then shipped across to Jax, so makes me wonder how good this is on tap. I was expecting something more in my face, given its popularity. Its like meeting Elisha Cuthbert, and she farts then picks her nose before shaking your hand. You're still amazed by the whole experience, but the simple labeling, and the lack of beer angels flowing from the bottle, no fanfare in the background, and every BA friend of yours, isn't ringing your phone off the hook to see how it really was. Guess I've put the top 10 or so on a pedestal. A marvelous beer, well worth trying, and loving. Easily worth the trade. Thanks Dakotah13 you've made my day."
"D: This is a great beer! I'm very happy I finally found a place that had it!"
"this pliny.. bottled on 012309... drink it fresh as it says on the label... it pours a medium orange color with a white head and good lacing... then wow what a smell it fills the room and the palete with outstanding aromas its fresh pine first then citrus grass and floral aromas... maybe juniper its fantastic.. the taste is better then the smell its all fresh pines first then light floral citrus hops with perfect malt support the mouthfeel is the same as the smell and the taste i dont need to repeat.. this is a perfect DIPA because it has superior balance betwen hops and malt alcohol and water.. ive never had a perfect DIPA but this is.... it fiils the mouth and nose.... it is perfection ..you just want another sip.. this is world class ..its nirvana for a DIPA. im going to buy more of this one"
"Truly one of the best DIPA's i've ever had the pleasure to try. A work of art!"
"D: A definite """5"" based on the aroma and the flavor. I can't think of many other beers I could drink more of. It isn't terribly alcoholic for a DIPA either. This definitely adds to the drinkability. Overall, this beer was the epic beer that everyone raved about. If I ever find it in a store again, I will buy as much as I can. Those of you who can get this locally are some of the luckiest bastards around."
"I have to say, Pliny the Elder was a bit more one dimensional than I was expecting. There wasn't much in the background, and I couldn't help but feeling slightly underwhelmed. Was it a very good beer? Absolutely. Would I have another one given the chance? Absolutely. Would I go out of the way to get one? Well...probably not. Still, a beer I am very glad I got the chance to try, and enjoy."
"Pours out a cloudy golden orange with a nice white cavernous head that laces sporadically. Nose is huge hops, pine, citrus, flowers. Hits the nose with this bombardment and leaves you begging for more. Taste is likewise starts almost floral with a hint of lemons and grapefruit leaves with a pine everywhere. Coating the mouth and lingering for quite sometime. Nice biscuity malt background somewhat makes this beer not too overwhelming and still drinkable even for the amount of hops that hit you. Overall a solid beer, I think I prefer the Blind Pig to this one, but that's kinda my taste and not knocking PTE. Overall a really nice beer glad I got to review it finally. Thanks again to PretzelCity!!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thick side thanks to the big amount of malt in there, but the nicely-balanced flavors have you coming back for more. Drinkability is good, but can be bested by some other 8% beers. But perhaps by not many 8% IPAs."
"D- Don't look at its place on the list, or take anyones word for it,try it out, its highly recomended for a reason. Let us know what you think, BA rules!"
"Poured from bottle into trusty pint glass while watching the season finale of my favorite show (Dexter if you're interested). What a great moment! Pours crystal clear and golden, fitting for such a famous beer. Creamy, two-finger, white head with great retention and lacing. Smell is great. A nice blend of hops. Some citrus/grapefruit but not overpowering, like some other west coast IPA's. A strong floral presence as well, some sweet malt too. Taste is boderline perfect. At first the hops seem somewhat mellow and controlled, but it hits you with a strong, bitter aftertaste that you dont want to go away. Detected both some piney and citrus hops and well as a distinct, but not overpowering, sweetness as it warms. Mouthfeel was medium, but still somewhat light. Very smooth and silky. Overall this is a great, well balanced beer. I guess I never noticed, until I did this review, that it is a Double IPA. The mastery of the balance is amazing and it does not come off as a Double and the ABV is undetectable. A truely great beer."
"i refused to review this beer based solely on the hype. but then this beer got inside of me. it went straight from my stomach to my head and started running circles around my brain. black was day, white was night, and pliny was still f*ckin awesome."
"thank you, Russian River."
"Pours a a nice golden color with orange tint and a foamy white head. Aroma is that of grapefruits and hops, slight alcohol aroma for me (some have said it was strong,i did not). Taste was pure heaven, I had a tongue-gasm. What a great beer! Nice bitter taste, citrus, hoppy, aftertaste was bitter but smooth. an awesome beer!! God I wish it was sold in NJ!!"
"d - oh yes, I could consume this all evening. without a doubt."
"It has a decent amount of carbonation and is not very heavy at all. One could easily drink a couple of these and enjoy each one. It is def. a top notch beer with high drinkability and excellent flavor."
"This definitely deserves its world class status.. I had very high expectations and I wasn't dissapointed at all..."
"D- Very drinkable. If this beer was distributed to OH, it would be a staple in the fridge. But given the opportunity I wouldn't hesitate to get more. I may have to bother my college friends in CA to send me some more lol"
"This is a better than avergae DIPA, but one of the best beers in the world? Heaven's no."
"D- Could I drink Pliny the Elder all night? Absolutely. Now if only that were a possibility."
"Remember to do as the bottle says and drink it fresh. I think mine was in the bottle for 4 weeks or so."
"Got 3 bottles from thewinecountry.com, tried 'em over the last couple weeks. Poured into a pint a hazy but brite golden orange with an average head and sticky lace. A faint nose of citrus and pine. First taste is of pine and spice but it's backbone is citrus and some floral aspects. There is just enough sweetness & breadiness to balance the hops. I was afraid any review of this beer would be based on the reviews past, I tried to review only on it's own merits. This is an extremely good DIPA, with more balance than is usually seen in this type. It hewed to a leaner style than I generally prefer, but pulls it off quite well. Satisfyingly thick on the tongue, this is an easily drinkable big beer."
"D: For an 8% beer, you'd never know. You pour the beer, and trust me, a few minutes later it's gone. Good thing I have a few."
"D= Very very very high. I really wish I had more of this. This is the best beer I have had and lives up to everything in deserves. If I could only get the younger I would be the happiest man alive. This babe impoved my day by ten fold. Great beer!!!!"
"Taste is great, same good stuff as in the smell plus that solid bitter ending. Leaves a pine aftertaste, gets my salivary glands going. Mouthfeel is very smooth -- I like that even though there's very little sweetness to this, it evens out & is very refreshing. Alcohol's well-hidden, I could put away a few of these in an evening without problem."
"Man what a great beer! It does lack a little compared to The Younger but very close! Younger seemingly has another layer between the grapefruit and the lingering sweetness. BUt this is an amazing beer you can get seemingly without much hassle on the west coast!"
"Update in July 2009 - A cloudy apple juice color with a decent bubbly white head and nice streaky lace. The aroma is very pleasant but decidedly pissy citrus hop, a little floral hint and some grainy malt. The flavor is deliciously blended citrus hops and almost herbal toffee, smooth, mid-bodied or better with a malty sweetness playing through the bitter beauty of this classic hoppy brew. There's bready lemon and a bit of a dry finish, yet it's quite refreshing served cold. It deserves it's reputation and is highly sessionable for anyone that enjoys their hops. Load up the fridge, cold or room temperature, this is a classic!"
"D: this will never get old, ever! The perfect balance of an impossible two: delicate and powerful"
"I have drinking this beer for years. Whether on tap, in a growler, or in the bottle, it is always enjoyable. I have introduced many friends to this beer and all have liked it. To me it is the epitome of a great """gateway beer""". It is amazing that a high alcohol brew with a lot of IBUs can be blended in such an accessible way."
"D: This beer is smooth, flavorful and powerfully characteristic. I woke up the next morning and smelled floral hops. My desires for more are out of control!"
"EDIT: I'm downgrading my review. Something is going on with Elder. The hops seem thinner, I'm getting more caramel as it warms than before, and overall it just seems to have changed for the worse. After having this side by side with Younger recently, the flaws of Elder were easier to detect."
"Overall: Pliny the elder is an absolutely fantastic IPA. Among the best of the best."
"Seems so much better than what I remember when I had it on tap a year ago. Tastes very fresh and nice... lovely IPA that is well worth getting, despite being a tad on the pricey side."
"Drinkability- Hops so commanding that I could detect virtually no alcohol. Beware the eight percent ABV. Hopheads, this will be one of your all time favorites. Save these for session ends as you will not be able to go backwards to lighter bodied or less hoppy beers after this."
"I'd love to try this one on cask!"
"Along with the Younger, this is the best IIPA I've ever had. Fantastic."
"D - Very good drinkability for a double IPA. Nice and tasty and an easy drink."
"Overall this lived up to the HYPE. It's one bad mother.... shut yo mouth."
"PLINEY THE ELDER IS A HOPHEAD DREAM. THE RIPE PINE AROMA RISES OUT OF THE BEER AS SOON AS IT OPENED. IT HAS A LIGHT FRUITINESS FOLLOWED BY A SHARP CITRIC ACID BITE IS AWESOME. THE FINISH STAYS WITH YOU. IN ALL I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BEER WORTHY OF THE TOP TEN. THE ONLY WAY IT COULD GET BETTER IS BE EASIER TO GET."
"It's a sneaky beer that you would like to keep drinking do to the taste, but the beer will catch up to you! Top 3 IPA's for me recommend to anyone."
"Taste is pretty smooth for an 8% beer. Nothing harsh, just nice hops and a well balanced malt profile. Very rich and flavorful, not as much of a hop bomb as I expected. Has a sweet but tart and bitter finish that only makes you want more. Good thing I got 2."
"For drinkability I think this beer is excellent. Like I said about the bitterness, the floral aspect of the hops makes it refreshing. Its the kind of beer I could enjoy with a summer bbq or a cool winter evening. A fantastic beer all around, one of the best."
"D - 8% well hidden. Not quite the """hop bomb""" I was expecting; just a very drinkable, well balanced DIPA. Can't wait to drink some more one day!"
"A third tasting of a three week old bottle has only further enhanced my appreciation of this beer. Amazing, I wish I lived in CA."
"This ranks among my top three favorite IPAs (Stone IPA and 90 Minute being the other two), and I have noticed little difference between drinking it from the tap versus from the bottle. Both are delicious - very full-bodied, fresh, and hitting the taste-buds just right without overwhelming them."
"Good enough to have 1 or 2 but I would probably find the oily bitter aftertaste a little unpleasant and overpowering after that. Not as hoppy as I expected it to be (I'm not a huge hop-head). I'll definitely have another one sometime soon."
"If the Younger seemed a little """thin""" at times, this one has no such problems. It's definitely a hop heaviness, without as much balance. It's almost hard to handle. The lady friend really liked the Younger, but this one was """too hoppy""". It doesn't have that supreme craftsmanship and balance of the Younger. But, it's almost better in a way. It's hoppy, and doesn't apologize for anything. That said, it's pretty heavy. Like a bomb."
"D: very very much so. I have found other dipas to have very low drinkability simply due to their abject lack of balance. somehow, even though it's not a balance with malt, this beer accomplishes that balance and is very pleasurable."
"All in all, pretty impressive. I've had a few here and there since last summer, and it always pleases. I can see how it's rated as one of the top brews, although I can't say I'm completely overwhelmed/floored. The bitterness is high, almost to the point of getting medicinal. The head isn't quite as stunning as I'd hope. But all in all, impressive. And a must try, if nothing else than to say you've tried it."
"Overall, a great beer, and I cannot wait to try it again, hopefully sooner, rather than later."
"Feels thick (not quite syrupy) in the mouth. Hopheads will find this drinkable."
"Drinkability: I would drink this all night at a bar and it will be a beer I keep around in my fridge for sure whenever I get a hop craving. This beer will more than take care of your craving for hops and might make you crave them even more. Here was this beer when I was first getting into beer? I would have turned a hop head instantly."
"O- This is my Favorite beer. It has enough sweetness to back up the Hop Profile, well balanced. It meets its expectation every time."
"At 8% alcohol this is dangerously pleasant and drinkable. I would love to have this is my go-to double IPA. As it stands I just need to get my hands on the resources necessary for me to have this more often."
"D - Like my wife said after she tried it """it tastes like summer""" and I agree that this beer could really shine on a warmer day in the summer but it's still pretty damn tasty even in February, yummy."
"If I had more than one of these I'd certainly be looking forward to a second one. Oh well, next time I get to the West Coast I'll revisit this hop heaven. Thanks to htomsirveau for this one via trade."
"This is a really good DIPA. In my opinion though, maybe not the best. I still think Great Divide's Hercules on tap and/or Stone's Ruination have this beat, but... still a strong contender for one of the better DIPA."
"Handed a glistening pint with a head that was near ice cream thickness. Smelled nothing but pine resin, grapefruit and pineapple. 2 fingers of foam just stayed there ring and lacing the glass. Taste was piney and citrusy hops balanced perfectly with malt. Sweetness kept the hops perfect. Almost had a candied orange flavor. Just amazing. Mouthfeel was smooth four a DIPA and the dryness kept asking for another sip. By far the best Double IPA I have had, though a few have come close. Excellent."
"Perfect drinkability for me. It's tastes great, smells amazing, and goes down smooth. When is this coming to NH?"
"Drinkability: This is an IPA, not a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I was very much expecting a """hop-bomb""" from the hype surrounding this offering. That was not to be. Yes, this is an exceedingly hoppy offering, but there is a """balance""" to this madness. I very much felt the presence of the earthy malty sweetness that """did battle""" with the hops for balance. I am NOT an IPA fan by any stretch of the mind, but I had to feel this one for myself. I'm very glad I did. This is very, very well done."
"This hop maharajah is truly a treat. Thanks to the people who traded with me for this beer."
"Been hearin' about this brew and finally got a taste and was very pleased. Rolled over to Toronado in San Diego and was excited to see this on draft. It definitely lived up to the hype. A beautiful golden brew with a nice white head. Citrus and floral scents up the nose and a filled and coasted the mouth as smooth as it can get. A gentle, nice pine flavor accompanied every sip and I turned to my bro and said, """this could be one of the best beers I have had in a year""". It might of been that I was achin' for a beer Saturday afternoon, but I believe that Pliny is an exceptional Double IPA without the harsh alcohol flavor and it was so tasty and I NEED MORE!"
"D - I could have way to much of this if it was always near by."
"Surprisingly light and refreshing mouthfeel contributes to an exceptionally drinkable beer. I could drink this beer all night. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was a complete surprise. For an 8%abv beer this is an amazingly delicate, subtle beer. I've had a lot of really good DIPAs but this is truly in a class of its own."
"Very well done, would drink this everyday if possible."
"Drinkability - Incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Just remember this is a high ABV beer."
"Never thought much of Pliny till I joined ba and saw it was. A top 100. So I bought me a bottle and as of tonight the elder is my 2nd favorite beer. The hype is right on. And I'm not a ipa drinker. This beer is great"
"Cask at O'Briens's SD, it didn't last long. 30 minutes or so. Cask Conditioned Pliny Elder, a very rare treat. Great nose, even better texture and an explosive mid. Maybe less on the pine, but the main difference is the mid palate. Though it was huge and dominating. Maybe a bit more amber? and I thought a tad more sweet though others didn't. Really excited to try and felt it was different and maybe a tad better than regular kegs. Some felt recent bottles are the best Pliny Elders because the freshness. Would not pass up on another opportunity to try a cask of Pliny."
"I have to give Vinnie at Russian River a big thanks for imagining and creating such a masterful brew for the world to enjoy. This is THE BEST DIPA I have ever had the grace of putting to my lips. Cheers!"
"The beer's appearance was not that impressive but everything after that was fantastic. There is such a strong hop presence but the bitterness of the hops are so well hidden. You receive all of the amazing flavor with none of the bitterness that turns some people away from beers high in hops."
"D - too drinkable"
"Great brew!!!"
"d: This is a little different than what i expected.. And im very pleased.. What a great beer.. Not much more intense then the Blind Pig.."
"D: I could have a lot of these."
"D - Pure pleasure."
"super smooth, tasty, hoppy, delicious ale. a bunch of flavor going on and lots of hoppiness to enjoy"
"Overall this beer was a treat. I'm happy that I finally tracked it down. NEED MORE!"
"All in all, a very worthy, delicious beer and a fine example of a proper Double IPA. East-coasters think DFH 120 is what a DIPA is supposed to taste like, but they have no clue what they're talking about. If you like beer, you'll like Pliny the Elder."
"D: One of the most balanced brews yet. Alcohol not very noticeable. Could be a candidate for a session-able DIPA."
"This is by far one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've ever tasted. If I lived in an area where this was readily available, this would always be in my fridge."
"Drinkability is off the charts. I am glad they started to bottle this; I will defiantly search this one out again."
"Hops, hops, and more hops...and I love it. So drinkable it's frightening. As great as expected and a must try."
"You the man, DJ! and Russian River should get some credit as well"
"Cant wait for pliny's younger brother to show up at Philly beer week 09."
"Exceptional beer. Very citrus hoppy aroma. Citrus piny hop flavor with a well ballanced malt sweetness. After hearing afterl the hype, the flavor caught me off guard on the first sip. Way more low cohum. hops. Not a strong bitter after bite. As the sipping went on, the last swallow begged for more. Absolutely exceptional."
"D- Goes down very easy and I could see myself having a few of these. Wish I could drink it on a regular basis. Thanks a bunch torchednoodle for the fantastic trade!"
"This bottle was from a trade shipment with 2/4 bottles broken, apparently due to freezing. This beer was previously frozen."
"I could easily sit and drink a few of these, but with so many West Coast IPAs, this beer is not the be- all, end- all, holy grail some have talked it up to be. Is it on my short list of best beer I've ever had? Yes, but it won't keep me from trying a different IPA next time I want one."
"This is a great beer, although it's not transcendent. I can see why people might be disappointed when they were led to believe that they would reach Nirvana upon tasting it. I try to ignore the hype surrounding a beer and rate it based solely on my tastes and how I think it compares to other similar beers (the key word here being """try"""). To me this simply ranks as an outstanding beer worthy of a great deal of praise. Is it the best DIPA ever? Well, not in my opinion, but it's certainly one of the best I've had, and I highly recommend it to others."
"Don't drink and review."
"d - excellent. considering the abv and ibu, it's surprisingly easy to knock back a few of these."
"D: I could easily drink several of these. I thoroughly enjoy Pliny the Elder, and it remains one of my favorite beers of all time."
"if there is such a thing as a perfect beer this is damn close to it!"
"It's a very good IPA, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype that proceeded it. If you want hops, go for Green Flash's IPA. If you want a well-rounded IPA, Pliny will do the job, but don't expect something mindblowing. It's just a perfectly-balanced, sessionable IPA."
"Golden with a slight orange tint. Head is white and bubbly and fades quickly with some lacing on my glass. The aroma is citrus, grapefruit, hops, pine, floral hops. Extremely drinkable, slightly dry, crisp, finish, lighter in body than I would have initially expected. Delicious. I will regularly keep my fridge stocked with a few of these..."
"Pours slightly hazy honey colored with thick bubbly head after a somewhat aggressive pour. Large bubbles clung to the glass, bridging to the diminishing head that thinned but stayed around to the last sip. Very nice warm floral hop aroma. Nicely balanced initial flavor with bitter hops and malt transitioning to a slowly evolving sweet malt and floral/bitter hop aftertaste that seemed to have a peak sweetness in the middle and a long bitter aftertaste that sits on top of the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderately carbonated, somwhere near the line between syruppy and crisp. Very nice. OVerall, this is a very tasty beer that is I agree is highly recommended if you can find it."
"Original review: Brewed on 12/7/11, less than 30 days ago. WTF? RR should give up bottling PtE, since PtE on tap is tied for best beer I've ever had, and in the bottle it's dependably junk. Maybe they should CAN it instead?"
"The alcohol is so well hidden, you would never believe it clocks in at a solid 8%, very very drinkable although you wouldn't want to drink more than one or two, as it surely does a number on your palate. Every time I get one of these in a trade I have to savor it though its hard with such a great drinkability. Now I need to get my hands on some of the Younger."
"Clean and dry with some lingering bitterness that is quite refreshing. Not over carbonated. Just about the best Double IPA I have ever had."
"Incredible and lives up to the hype. If only I could easily get my hands on the stuff."
"Bottle: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium bitter hops notes with some well crafted citrus notes also dominating. I thought the taste of malt was somewhat subtle and overshadowed by some citrusy and bitter hops. Full body with great carbonation. Although this is a very well crafted IIPA is still think it is lacking some of the grapefruit notes that can elevated the style to another level."
"Notes: Tremendous beer and one of my favorite DIPAs. Russian Rivers comes through on this one. Alcohol warming is present but subdued. The intense hops are balanced perfectly with malt and result in great drinkability. Perhaps it's only downfall as a DIPA is that it is almost too balanced. If you have not tried this beer you are missing out."
"Crazy drinkable brew."
"All in all, this is worth the hype. I would find this impossible to turn down, if I could actually get it in Indiana. DIPA's are my favorite style, and Im not sure there is a better one out there. Pliny the Elder is def. the most well balanced Imperial IPA I have ever had. Truly a remarkable beer."
"The paradigm DIPA. Not as high in abv as some and that is is good thing. This one is all about the taste and drinkability. Glad I have two more bottles. Big thanks to swnicholson for this one."
"Bottled on 090208. Yellow to light orange. Soft soap bubble white head. The aroma is and flavor are full of pine and citrusy goodness, but to be honest, I feel Blind Pig really have a better aroma and more hop flavor. This was very easy to drink and pretty enjoyable, but I'd never think of it as Imperial or Double. I guess that is a good thing. If I were to compare this to Dreadnaught, it would lose badly."
"review taken from notes, bottled on 9/22/08 and drank in earley november. poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a light golden yellow with a slight wite head. the smell was flowers and lawn clipings. the first sip put me off a bit as it was pungent bitter with no body to it, after a few sips i changed my toon. the bitter tastes VERRY piney all the way through, with hints of yard trimings, flowers a tuch of bread then my tastebuds had to surender as the bitter aftertaste holds them hostage. this is the first beer that i hated at first sip but was craving more by the end, russian river has a master pice on ther hands"
"This is just one hell of an epic beer. The head wasn't too great, but plenty of lacing, good carbonation, and pale amber in color. The smell. My god. Best smelling beer I have had the pleasure of smelling, like a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers with some pine and citrus notes. The taste was exceptional. Whatever hops they used, its just perfect and we'll leave it at that. Awesome mouthfeel, and the finish is a lovely bitterness that lingers in your lymph nodes that makes you just want more, and more, and more. Drinkability is outstanding; for 8%, the alcohol is WELL hidden, I could drink this all night every night. I may be fluffing this beer a bit much, but it is my absolute favorite beer as of now, and im just glad that Russian River decided to start distributing in CO. I might have to order a case because its so hard to find and in such high demand. Simply Outstanding."
"D: My first beer off of the BA Top 10 list. Because I knew that going in, I think I was expecting a little too much from it. Very nice overall, but not earth shattering. I'm still glad that I tried it."
"D: This is one of the rare enormously flavorful beers that begs to be drank in terms of pints. So hoppy and savage one second, can't wait to take another sip the next. Rare victory of a big beer that one simply cannot get enough of in a sitting. The only drawback is this isn't packaged in a six pack instead of 500 mL singles."
"D - Overall a good beer that wants to kick your teeth in. I would like to taste more malt presence though."
"Notes: This is absolutely awesome! Now that I have been around the block with some of the other top-notch DIPA's out there, I can honestly say this is the cream of the crop! A great example of why I love craft beer. If you have even the slightest fancy for the hop, then do yourself a favor and respect your elders. Highly recommended to say the least!"
"This was one of the stickiest DIPAs I have encountered. Huge citrus component with incredibly pine tastes. Huge thanks to my man Barry!"
"This one is pretty damn good. I wish i had it on tap. The bottle on date was 11/26/08 so a little over a month ago. I'm glad i bought more then 1 bottle!"
"Pliny the Elder is a refreshingly hoppy beer that doesn't disappoint when it comes to a bitter nose and relatively smooth finish. This beer is a Russian River favorite and always aims to please. Named after the supposed discoverer of hops this beer would do Pliny proud."
"D/O: A beer that is well-worth the hype, and even better if you can find it fresh on draught. One of the easiest drinking and most balanced DIPAs around, I hope this finds wider distribution in bottles, as I'd like to try a brewery-fresh batch with no lingering illness."
"The beer is poured with a good fluffy one inch head with a orangish copper colour. Great retention and lacing. Looks great, but could be slightly darker. The nose has a huge hoppy aroma. Some citrus hints, but it primarily dominated by piny/resiny hops, and a little bit of caramel sweetness comes through at the end. This should be a cologne. The beer is incredibly bitter, which is to be expected. The hop flavour is definitely quite grassy/piny/resiny. The beer has a lot of flavours that are hard to put my finger on, but once you've had a few sips the bitterness goes away and the caramel malts comes through. The mouthfeel is good, fair amount of carbonation and slightly creamy. The beer is fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability is very good. I could keep sipping this one until the alcohol wins out. A great beer!!"
"Why are you still reading this? Go find this beer and drink it."
"drinkability- this one goes down way to easy. could drink 4 or 5 of these no problem"
"I poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. The aroma was noticed before the appearance. Intense pine notes are released when the bottle is opened. After I poured the first bottle, my brother in law could smell the pine 10 feet away. The beer pours a deep yellow, when held up to a light it is very clear. The head is impressive and leaves a respectable amount of lacing. The taste follows the nose. The pine flavors are up front and intense. The aftertaste lingers well after the beer is sipped. The beer is a medium bodied sipper. An excellent brew! The finest DIPA I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is a beer with a unique flavor. Its high rating is well deserved. Pliny is a beer one could pleasantly get loaded on. Don't get me wrong its not a hot summer beer but one that is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to have more. An excellent story is presented on the label, which adds mystique."
"The aroma is exquisite with lots of citrus and pine hops (cascade). There is also a fair amount of sweet malt. The appearance is pale gold with a light haze. The flavor is like the aroma and quite bitter but without much alcohol punch. The palate is a bit thin and not as carbonated as I would have liked. Overall a GREAT example of a double IPA!"
"Perhaps my favorite DIPA to date. Many beers in this style have disappointed me lately and this was a welcome treat. I highly recommend any hophead seek this beer out."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable DIPA"
"D - Very drinkable beer. Especially for being 8% ABV."
"Another awesome beer from Russian River. Well done!"
"Pour is a shiny golden shade and the bouquet and mouthfeel are both heavily imbued with pine needles. This is about as good looking, smelling and tasting as a beer can get, and I'm happy we finally got distribution of this and Blind Pig up here, hopefully we'll get more of their brews soon!"
"It poured out a nice bronze/gold color with almost no head by the time it reached my coaster. Lacing was minimal but a light ring stayed the duration. The aroma was hoppy as expected in a DIPA with citrus, strong pine and hints of floral accents. Very hoppy/piney taste that hung around for a long while after my first sip. This beer's flavor will defintely grab your attention! The carbonation is very light making it easy on the way down."
"Bottle thanks to Secret Santa.Pours a clear, shining golden orange color with a foamy white head leaving soapy, spotty lacing behind. The aroma simply explodes from the glass with striking notes of juicy, fresh-picked oranges, grapefruits, and lemons. A lightly sweet, pale malt background sets the perfect background for the massive hop profile to do .The flavor is deliciously juicy, with bitter, resinous citrus and lemongrass hops,lightly toasted toffee and caramel malts,with a hint of honey. There's nothing overly complex going on, but it is so well blended it is incredible. Medium-full, smooth, slightly sticky body. This is so incredibly drinkable. A delicious IIPA that ranks right up there with the best of them. Thank you to the beer gods for giving me the chance to try this."
"Overall just an all around amazing beer. It will definetly be spending more time at my house."
"Delicious. Intense on first drinking but just really nice and pleasant."
"will drink many more very soon."
"I know I didn't give it perfect 5s, and I doubt I will ever give anything such a rating. What can I say? But if aliens came to Earth and asked for the purpose of human life, I would give them a bottle of Pliny the Elder...Wait, if I had a bottle, I would probably bludgeon them to death with a nine iron, then drink it myself. But it's the thought that counts."
"Mouthfeel was a touch thin for me. This could be a perfect IPA but listed as a double IPA makes this one fall short a touch. I could easily drink this any day, all day. A hop lovers dream without the extreme bitterness."
"Thanks For Reading"
"I can't add much to what has been written by others. This is your basic desert island beer. If you can find it, drink it - and you will savor it."
"Absolutely delicious. Never had a better IPA in the bottle."
"Had this on tap several time and bottle a few as well. Draft rating. Pour is cloudy orange with a big creamy head that disappears rather quickly, but leaves a bit behind. Nice lacing. Aroma is piney and citrus hops with malt sweetness. Flavor is hoppy, but not overwhelming. Like chewing fresh, wet hops...but with a good malt balance. Finishes very clean. One of my favorites."
"This beer pours a very cloudy amber with a light white head and a decent amount of lacing. The nose is of grapefruit, oranges and pine.... big hops :) The taste is very strong, especially the grapefruit hops flavor, and this beer does pocess a large malt base to be able counteract the massive ammount of hops. The mouthfeel is nice, a little undercarbonated in my opinion, but for such a huge DIPA the dry feeling afterwards is minimal. A very drinkable brew, I just wish I could get more of it :)"
"On tap at the Falling Rock. Pours hazy orangish with thick off white head that lasts and laces fairly strongly. Reeked of hops and citrus. Tastes like a hoppy dream explosion, full of citrus and pine notes. Noticed tastes in bottles is about the same, just a little less intense and definitely mellows in time (definitely a better beer fresh). One brew I'm glad makes it to Colorado."
"Can't wait to have Pliny the Younger, if I can find it."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had! RRBC IMO is one of the best American brewers out there."
"D: Very drinkable for the style. Extremely well balanced. Best DIPA I've had to date. This one lives up to it's lofty reputation."
"Dr - Can be enjoyed by itself, with a big meal (I had a first glass by itself and then one with grilled steak tips, which it held up to just fine), or during a big snow storm (Yep, got that, too!), or whenever."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I finally got to try. Well worth the hype and the high ranking. Highly, highly recommend. ADIPA is not an everyday style for me as they are aggressive hopped and kill the tongue for a bit but when I do want one I hope this is in the fridge. If avail here, I'd have several times a year."
"Had it on tap at Rosie & Joe's. Solid Imperial IPA. Pours a clear golden with a huge frothy white head that cannot be beaten back. Strong citrus aroma. First taste is massive hops, but then immediately dissipates. Finish is uncharacteristically dry. They compare it to Stone, so I will: this is a great Imperial IPA, but the Ruination has the edge."
"Poured into a glass and the smell of hoppiness was instant. The color is a light orange/tan when light passes through (I usually prefer a slightly darker color for a double-IPA). The taste is amazing, hops are perfectly balanced and the malts are very present despite its lighter color. Its hard to tell if there is a dominant hop flavor (citrus, pine, melon...), but overall the hoppiness is very pleasant. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate but after awhile the stomach begins to warm up. The beer has a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is high if you are a hop-head otherwise it may be difficult to drink. Overall, this beer was very enjoyable and it is as good or possibly better then the numerous hoppy beers that flood the San Diego market."
"When poured, the color was a medium light hazy golden yellow with some foam and a load of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of flavorful hops, hops and more hops filled the nose with a pleasant soft aroma, of hops. The taste of the hops was very noticeable from mouth to palate. Probably the Best IPA I've drank ever. Some others were close, but not lick this one. No big bite, or over bitterness or sour tasting. Just a soft pleasant taste of hops, with hints of some candied citrus."
"Enjoy this if you can spot it."
"Very complex beer and very mind blowing. This is definitely the best IPA I can remember having. Russian River: please start bringing this out to the east coast on a normal basis! Please, I'm begging you!"
"AMAZING!"
"Drinkability: One is not enough! I need more more more! I can't wait to go back home and buy some more of this."
"4/4.5/5/4/4.5"
"I'm lucky to have picked a case of this up while in the Bay area a few weeks ago. I'm keeping it cold and enjoying it this winter. It's a good enough beer to cut into my normal winter beer menu, which doesn't see tons of IPAs."
"D - This one is very easy to drink. The alcohol does not get in the way at all. Once the taste buds are destroyed by the bitterness it just starts drinking very smooth for the style. I would gladly have another one of these brews. Russian River has brewed a very nice beer in the Pliny the Elder. This is an easily recommemded beer."
"The second bottle was opened with a familiar sound and it seems to have not suffered the same fate as the first. The pour contains a wonderful head that perfumes my senses immediately, from a distance, with the same wonderful smell that the first bottle had provided only at close range except a bit more pine. The taste is the same barage of hop wizardry. I think I'm in love. masterful... even though I lowered the score for the appearance and mouthfeel of the first bottle."
"Overall, I must say that I am impressed. This one truly lives up to the hype."
"For your own good, if you are going to trade for it, get it from someone who can get it close by to the source so they can send you a fresh bottle. It would be a shame to not drink this as fresh as possible. Can't wait to move to the Bay Area."
" Very big, bitter hopGoes down remarkably smooth, considering all the hops and alcohol."
"I received bottles from 2 different trades w/ JamesCrames and Bbothen and was blown away. This is one of the few beers to truly live up to all of the hype. The appearence is a light golden yellow with a very nice thin lacing. The aroama hits you as soon as you open a bottle. Citrus hops can be smelled from a few feet away. The first sip is truly amazing. With so much hop aroama you would think the beer would be way to bitter. It is the total opposite. This beer is extremely balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Overall I think this is one of the best beers I have ever had the chance to drink and would recommend it to anyone even people who wouldnt consider themselves hopheads."
"A pleasurable beer but I must say; What is all the fuss about? It is just one one many hoppy, fun beers."
"When I first went to Russian River, I wanted to try a barrel aged beer or The Younger, but there were none of those to be found. A local said """Get the Elder, you won't be disappointed!""" Well there began my love affair with Pliny the Elder, hands down my favorite hoppy beer I have tried."
"I know it now comes from northern California, but this style started in Riverside County, and for that we shoud all be grateful. Cheers to a great beer."
"Pliny: You nail it on the nose. Few, maybe only one, can exceed the magical aroma. Everything else? Smell is the strongest sense tied to memory. Enough said."
"taste is crisp yet smooth, thick on the tongue, hop flavor grows as you drink, caramel, grapefruit, dandelion, and some woodiness, ends nicely bitter."
"I had this at a friends place, lets just say I was a little excited to try it. The nose on this beer was very sweet and hinted with hops and wheat notes. It is obvious both in taste and smell that hops are the main flavoring but there's a complexity to the hops that you don't find in many IPAs. The tast is very hoppy but mostly sweet and citrus flavors integrated. It has some bittering notes but just during the swallow, not at the end where IPAs usually get bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. Easily one of the best Double IPAs I've had, I highly recommend it."
"I really could drink this one all day"
"this is one of the finest hoppy beers. highly recommend."
"well, there you have it. one bottle of pliny the elder down, and one review in the can. next i'm going to make a black and tan with the remaining bottle of pliny and an Old Rasputin i had laying around. wish me luck."
"Russian River stresses that this beer should be consumed fresh. Once you've tasted your first one, I don't think that storage is ever going to be a problem."
"The Pliny coats my tongue in a complex way setting off taste buds on both the bitterness and citrus areas....a light grassy finish with a balanced hop oil residue on the sides of my mouth. This has now become my favorite double IPA. Well Done!!"
"I don't have a strong nose, but the moment I opened the bottle, I was hit by an orange, citrus aroma with a little pine in it. The 500 ml bottle filled up a tulip glass with a light orange brew, with a centimeter or two of solid foam, which gently clung to the glass as I sipped. It's pretty amazing how this much bitterness tasted this smooth. The flavor had orange and grapefruit citrus character, as well as a note of cream, with a stong bitterness that was smooth and refreshing, rather than simply punching me in the mouth. Mouthfeel was creamy as well. Surprised that at 8%, I really couldn't taste the alcohol. Interestingly enough, as it warmed, it didn't change in it taste profile as a lot of beers do. Great beer drinking experience."
"500ml bottle from Beverages 4 less in Santee. Pours copper with a big white sudsy head that has good retention and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is relatively strong with loads of citrus (mostly grapefruit and some orange) and a big dose of sweet cotton candy. The taste is more of the same with accent on the citrus, plus biter hops followed by cotton candy on the side and back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is medium malty with a crisp note and the carbonation is lively. The finish is long with biter-sweet hops. This is one of the great IPA's, I'm glad I can get it locally. I absolutely love this stuff, but Blind Pig is my go-to everyday IPA now that Sculpin is impossible to find. Rock on RR."
"I was excited to try this one as Pliny the Elder has only recently become available here in Seattle and it did not disappoint. Prior to this experience I was not a fan of IPAs/DIPAs, but Pliny has converted me. I loved this brew. The malt provided a good balance to the hops especially as the beer warmed. Just an all-around amazing brew. I'm glad that Pliny has arrived in Seattle."
"I finally got a chance to try this IIPA. The offering was a pint on tap. The beer was a nice golden color with a nice silky taste. It had nice hop aroma and a good bitter bite but not enough of a bite for my liking. It's a highly drnkable brew and obviously deserves the rating it has and a few more localities selling it."
"Drinkability: Hold onto your hats! A couple of pints of Elder will have you singing the next song up on the karaoke. It goes down too smoothly to enjoy only one..."
"Finally, bottled Pliny! I've sucked back many of these at the fabled Toronado on the Haight, but cracked my first bottle of Pliny tonight. Nothing special to look at, but just wait until the citrusy aroma starts to waft over your nostrils. Pliny is piney, with a nice lingering bitterness. No way this is an 8% ABV! Nice, nice, nice..."
"Overall Im glad I decided to grab a bottle to review, ive had it in the past and hadnt seen it for a while, now that I know where to find it I will be drinking it alot more often."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability both get 5's when style is taken into consideration. This is a IIPA, but the bitterness won't make you pucker your mouth, and you will want more after each sip. Most IIPA's would have to be considered strictly """sippers""" that must be nursed, but this can be drank in the same way an IPA would."
"Drinkability is VERY good. Despite its 8.0% ABV, I could and would drink this often and probably more than 1 if I was not rationing what I had!"
"As drinkable s any I've ever had. I've had Pliny on draft, so this was no surprise to me."
"D- Highly drinkable, even when warmed to 65 degrees F.(Yes, I temped it.) This is one of the first and still one of the best for its style."
"Very very good beer, I now get the hype."
"Drinkability - yes, another completely drinkable brew from RR. Many crispy, hop cradled kudos to BGThang for sending this fine, oustanding creation my way."
"D-All day every day. Until I got sick of IPAs."
"this brew pours up a clear copper color with a big bubbly white head. great lacing. the nose is straight grapefruit yo! and floral hops. it tastes very smoothe, mellow hops, lots of grapefruit, floral hops, sticky on the lips. medium bodied, low carbo, sweet finish. Nice IPA..."
"I was expecting this beer to excel in a different way. I figured that all of its flavors would be extremely out there. Instead this is a full and balanced IPA. Sure you can call it an imperial, sure you can say it's a double. In fact that is a more fair statement with this beer then most double IPAs that are more like extremely hoppy barleywines or just retarded hoppy beers period. This beer is obviously an IPA it is an IPA first and a double or imperial second. In fact making this a double makes this MORE drinkable then the average single IPAs."
"My first bottle. This was excellent, but not the best I've had. Still, really excellent!"
"D: Drinkability betrays its big hoppy flavor and abv...dangeroiusly drinkable."
"M/D - Medium body and very clean mouthfeel. Oh, so easy to drink. Amazing brew."
"D: Actually very good for a DIPA. Much more drinkable than Younger but not nearly the same beast."
"Bottle generously shared by footbalm, thanks man! Pours a clear golden hue with a tall and thick white head. The aroma is great; tons of sweet citrus hops, a full grapefruit, some sweet fruits, and a background of pine. The flavor was so easygoing and yet so awesome; dominated by a citrus hop flavor, some bitterness getting through but the sweet ripe citrus hop flavors rule the day here. Not overly complex, but very quaffable and excellent. I could drink 20 of these. A nice full body too."
"Just an unreal beer. Definitely goes into my top 10. (perhaps top 5)"
"Overall- Awesome."
"D- The relative lack of availability of this beer in the Midwest prevents me from saying this, but I probably could have this every day. IPAs aren't necessarily my first choice, but this was really quite nice."
"Overall - A very nice, approachable IPA. It's hard to believe it's a double/imperial IPA since it went down easier than most """regular""" IPAs I've had. Good introduction to the style."
"The only drawback to this beer is a smaller than normal bomber size. 16.9 ounces. But as a special brew I give it a big thumbs up!"
"This is about my 3rd go around with this beer and now I'll finally get around to reviewing it. Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet glass. This beer pours a translucent shade of light copper with sticky lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is like a cut fresh pine tree mixed with tangerines and just a slight bit of malty sweetness. The taste is a full frontal assault with a pine branch. The piney notes are really an affront to the palate but the strange thing is it finishes really watery. I figured there would be a bigger bang at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit boozy and astringent but it does create a nice piney mouth coating. This is a good beer, but honestly, I think its kind of a product of the hype machine."
"You MUST be a hophead to truly enjoy this beer. It is well-executed and bold, but I personally find it overbearingly hoppy."
"D: This is one of my favorite IPA's, I could sit and have a few of these. I just wish I didn't have to wait until friends from out West come home to restock!"
"I would love to revisit this beer fresh from the source."
"Generous extra received in a recent trade with Mauerhan (thanks Topher). Served in my DT tulip. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a half inch frothy, off-white cap embedded with copious tiny ringlets; some tiny bubbles also present in solution. Head dissipated into a soapy skim in the center with a band of ringlets that coalesced around the edges; some spatters of lacing present during the tasting. Nose off the cap was sweet grapefruit and a little bit of piney hops. Flavors were much more balanced; not overly sweet not overly bitter; a residual aftertaste lightly lingered between quaffs. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with a mild effervescence consistent throughout. Easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. I'm not really an IPA fan, but I'm really starting to dig DIPAs. I can certainly appreciate the qualities of this brew, but I prefer them a little sweeter."
"Awesome BEER!!! I was stoked to try this in their brewpub in santa rosa. Awesome piney (pliny?) but not too bitter hop finish...great depth all over the mouth. It tastes like a good mix between normal super strong imperial IPAs and a solid normal one. This was a terrific beer that i savoured for about an hour."
"Overall I have now consumed this one in the bottle, on draft, and via growler. No matter how it comes it is no doubt on of the best beers in the world."
"D: For an imperial IPA this is incredibly drinkable. Pass the Pliny please."
"D: The best part about this is after you drink half a glass, you can refill from the bottle to top the glass off!"
"Notes from and tasted on 8/26/05."
"All other amazing qualities aside, Pliny the Elder is one of the most crisp, refreshing, and easy-to-drink IIPA's out there. The hoppiness is in-your-face with bitter pine, fresh greenery, and floral bursts; however, it never gets too resiny or overly bitter. Plus, the malts provide a beautiful balance of light biscuit and caramel that neither cloys in its sweetness, nor outshines the hop character. Mouthfeel is crisp, perfectly carbonated, and refreshing, with a medium body and lingering hoppy bite. The alcohol is almost undetectable, and I kind of like it that way. Although the Elder came across more like a single IPA than an imperial one, I didn't mind. The hops were well-utilized and the drinkability was top-notch. Does it belong in the top 10? Maybe... Is it a fantastic brew deserving of any hop-head's palate? Absolutely."
"Zum wohl!"
"D: The drinkability of this beer is sickening. The balance of flavors is just superb. There's really no telling where the malt ends and the hops begin, which I feel is pretty rare for this style. And yet I don't feel like the hops are toned down...no question this pleases the hop head in me. The alcohol is not particularly high for a DIPA, either, so a couple pints of this wouldn't be out of the question. This is truly a beer that lives up to the hype, and truly one of the best in the style. I am thrilled beyond words that they're actually bottling and distributing this widely enough that I can pick it up in LA."
"D: The 8% alcohol is hidden behind the Spector-esque wall of hops. A masterpiece."
"D - I have brewed the homebrew recipe Vinnie has given out over the years and it is damn close but the real thing is so much smoother. This beer proves to me that my favorite IPA's focus on later addition hops creating a nice balance without the complete mouth puckering bitterness. Amazing how much hop flavor and aroma you can put in a beer and still make it appear balanced."
" This stuff is very, very good. If you are a Hop lover you must add this to your list. Surprisingly light and drinkable, yet powerful."
"I am not sure if I am enjoying this so much because it's my first time putting the sensory process on paper as I experience it... but this has catapulted to the top of my list for its style and beers in general. This is my 4th offering from RR and each one has seemed to build off the one before it. They are certainly doing special things there."
"The pentultimate DIPA IMHO. Perfectly balanced between hops and malts. Better than DFH90..."
"Overall impression: D-IPA is my favorite style and I am an unabashed hophead. That said, I put this right up there with my favorites. This IS a hophead's dream with a nice, complex mix of hops aromas and tastes. I've had this on tap as well (though I am reviewing now from a bottle) and both present a nice creamy, easy-to-drink brew, especially for a D-IPA. It may even go down a little TOO fast for an 8%!"
"EDIT: I've revisited this one again and again (although I've never bothered to write a good review of it), including on-tap, in bottles, and on-tap at the brewery. It's fantastic every time."
"Thanks also bbehr and hopluva1!"
"I've wanted to try this one for a while, and I was not disappointed whatsoever. Has to be one of the top 2 or 3 american double IPA's out there."
"Hands down one of my favorite IPAs and I am fortunately only a stoned-throw away from the tap."
"I might have hit a milestone tonight. Darkness on tap followed by my first Pliny. Every night should start & end like that!"
"Davecooks...thank you thank you thank you."
"D - Easy to drink, clean, and extremely enjoyable."
"D: For a beer in this style, and of this ABV this is very drinkable, wow, I can't rave enough about how easy it is to drink, I could easily spend a night with this beer, it wouldn't be appreciated, but this is a fine beer. excellent!"
"I greatly appreciate the opportunity to try this one out! Beer trading rocks and if I can set you up with something, hey, let me know."
"D: good...wait, great beer. damn near perfect, but not much gets the 5.0. Will definitely persue this beer again and again. ABV is a little high."
"Feels thick and oily and is exceptional to drink. Another beer I could easily drink every night."
"I really think that if I had to choose only one beer to drink for the rest of my life Pliny the Elder would be a hard brew to deny. I just wish they would bottle Pliny the Younger and distribute to Colorado. I've heard it is unreal."
"Pours golden yellow with a thick, creamy, white 1 finger head that dissipates quickly into a thin lacing. Piney initial aroma recedes into grapefruit and a touch of wet green grass. Surprisingly sweet, sharp fruit flavor of pineapples and mango balance out the bitterness of the hops which are almost an afterthought until the alcohol kicks in. The flavors linger and mingle on the palate held together by the incredible creamy malts. The sweet start is punctuated by a long, dry, finish. Like it's namesake, this beer is complex, worldly and iconic."
"The bottle poured a perfect clear golden liquid, with a good amount of carbonation and a nice little head. Good lacing with this DIPA too. It smells fresh and sweet, a good amount of floral hops with a fruity sweetness. Its taste is a little less hoppy than the smell, but pleasing since I drank the beer alone. I would have needed food had I had more than 1. It has a light feeling in the mouth that finishes pleasantly. I'm happy to have had this DIPA!"
"A lighter mouthfeel for a DIPA is pleasing to me as this is a beer that could be quaffed were it not for the rarity. This is a good IPA, but there are others more readily available that would match us to this one."
"This was a little hard to drink alot of on its own, for me, as the bitterness was overwhelming after awhile, but if I had paired this with food, any food, I could drink much more of it."
"Drinkability- Well despite the fact that I have a mild hangover from last nights drinking adventures, this thing went down really well. I imagine that in the 3 months since this has been bottled the hops have faded a bit yet this remains fantastic. I will try this fresh sometime that I promise! Big thanks again to Wayne for sending my way!"
"A: A finger of foam on a straight pour, the head stuck around for 5 minutes and as it settled it left some sticky spots on the side of the glass, crystal clear, golden straw - 4.50, S: Pliny packs a powerful punch of pine and grapefruit - a hop lover's heaven, some faint signs of tropical fruit and cantelope, the aroma is thick and pungent and utterly delectable - 5.00, T: As I take the first sip and try to figure out the palate the bitter hops on the tail jump out, having done a homebrew based on Pliny the Elder I'm familiar with the hop build (Vinnie posted his recipe online) and the hop that stands out is the earthy Columbus hops, also lots of resiny flavors, malt as you might expect is present to balance out the beer but it truly plays second fiddle to the hops - 5.00, M: More body than I'd expect, mildly sticky and syrupy - 4.75, D: Given the difficulties in acquiring this beer, I savor it for those reasons alone, but this is top notch, hands down one of the best Double IPAs I've had - 5.00"
"Frankly, I've had double IPA's that achieve much of what Russian River has with this style yet I appreciate the quality and complex flavors created by this wonderful brewery. I tip my cap to Russian River. I also enjoy this brew while thinking of Pliny the Elder, a hero who saved those fleeing from the eruption of Mt Vesuvius, who I'm certain would be honored to know a creation of such high quality as this was brewed in his name."
"A fantastic brew. A great pairing for a filet mignon. Clearly worth the high praise it recieves. A must for any fan of beer."
"This beer pours a light orange color with a thin head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells of grapefruit and other citrus flavor. The taste is very citrusy with grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy, full body with a dry finish. Drinkability is high and is limited only by its high abv. Truly a must try."
"Thanks again to Christina for getting me this gem. Pours a decent enough clear gold, with a small white head show. Head quickly becomes a white ring of lace, with some staying power. Smell is of earthy hops, reminiscent of onions or cabbage. Some bits of grass and citrus can be smelled in the background. Taste starts off with some sweet honey comb and citrus, and follows through with the onion like hops. Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than was expected, but full of flavor. Alcohol warmth can be felt after the first few pulls on this brew, but I could see myself going through another bottle of this without a problem. An impressive DIPA from Russian River. Reminds me a lot of Stone's 10th Anniversary DIPA, which also showcased that same onion like hop profile. Worthy of the hype? Not really in my opinion, but still a damn good beer, and one to seek out. Cheers"
"Vote Pliny for President."
"Now it just needs to be more accessible on the East coast."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy off white head that disappears quickly. Nose is hops, lovely piny resinous grapefruity hops. Leans more towards the pine than to the citrus side. Taste is pretty much a citrus and pine explosion that leaves the mouth coated with bitter hop oils. I can't find any malt here, but I'm okay with it. Finish is dry, but the taste lingers begging you to take another sip. Well I've wanted to try this forever and finally got a chance, now I want more!! Great hop bomb."
"This is a really great beer. I know understand what people have been talking about all these years. This is a big freaking IPA. Delicious and deliciously complex. I would have grabbed more than one, but I got the last one on the shelf."
"Not my favorite DIPA but surely a terrific beer. A must try for a hophead. I revisited it a couple of times both on tap and bottled, just doesn't blow me away."
"Like I said, DIPA/IPA are my favorite types of beer. I have had countless DIPA/IPA ranging from local microbrews to national breweries. IMHO this is by far the best one of them all. Now if only I could get Russian River Brewing Co. to move to Ohio. It is quite scary to think that Pliny has a younger relative out there somewhere."
"B+ score becomes an A."
"Well, well. I must say, the hype is real. May be, no, is the best IPA I've ever had. Supremely easy drinker, and my god this beer is good. I wish I had a steady supply of this angelic nectar. Hats off and three cheers to Russian River Brewing!"
"It really doesn't get much better than this. The best beer of my favorite style. Cheers!"
"Wow! That about sums it up; so luscious with hop character, but so beautifully and delicately balanced, not overdone by the slightest margin. An absolute joy to drink."
"D: More. Seriously glad this is now bottled. One day it will hopefully be available in NY. Until then this is why we trade."
"D= One of the absolute best DIPAs I have ever had and that is saying something. I really appreciate that the brewer found a way to intensely hop this beer, make it big enough and malty enough to balance most of those hops, and still keep the beer rather light and crisp (not thick or syrupy like many beers of this style are). Incredible and highly recommended!"
"It's amazing that an 8% beer can be so dry, but PtE does it amazingly well. This, along with Blind Pig, are the perfect examples of the style."
"D: This is my second time trying this beer and it delivers again. An overall really nice beer that both satisfies the hop craving and also has a really well rounded taste and a good ABV but not too much."
"To sum up, I would like a job marketing this beer. That seems easy and full of opportunities for tastings while getting paid and if they could throw in an isolated redwood grove that would be appreciated."
"My second RR brew after Blind Pig. Pours a tangerine orange color bordering on rust with no head and very little lacing. Big time hoppy aroma of grapefruit, citrus and pine. Nice hop bitterness, plenty of bitter grapefruit rind, lemon peel, orange, and some thick pine resin. Some pale malt make up a decent backbone. Ever so dry on the finish. Sweetness is subdued. Very thick and smooth, creamy on the tongue with only the slightest bite from carbonation, which is in short supply. Alcohol presence is not quite hidden, but hidden enough for the high ABV. A great brew but could see having one at a time given the incredible bitterness from hops. I hope to see this beer in my hands again in the future."
"Bitter, but rounded - this is deceptively drinkable!"
"D: I would order this beer every time if it were on tap. I had two tonight, and unfortunately, that was all I could handle. (I didn't eat shit today so get off my case!) But that says a lot if I am getting the same beer twice, since I like to try new things most of the time. Definitely try this beer if you like well designed beers and a boatload of hops."
"Excellent beer...thanks to the Wolfman for this treat.."
"D: An excellent DIPA, finding a delicate balance in flavours without being overwhelmed with bittering flavours that would hide inconsistencies or flaws. An excellent beer, and among the better hoppy brews I have experienced."
"Pours hazy, light copper in color with a nice stiff 3 finger off head. The wonderful aroma of grapefruit and floral hops assaults the nose. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a slightly sweet caramel malt that does a nice job backing up the hops. The finish is a little grassy with the alcohol mildly present and could best be described as dry. The beer is medium bodied and the carbonation is not overwhelming. To sum things up this is a pretty tasty brew and I am happy to have had the opportunity."
"Pretty much this is DIPA perfection. There's a reason this beer is so hyped. I pray for the day that this stuff gets distributed far and away."
"The pleas by Russian River on the label to """consume Pliny fresh or not at all""" and """do not age""" are to be respected. """Hoppy beers are not meant to be aged!""" sayeth Vinnie and R.R. It makes sense, but that's a discussion for the board--I'm just glad I was able to drink this only 6 weeks after it was bottled. Pliny the Elder, you did not die in vain!"
"Mouthfeel was medium but I expected it to be a bit richer. With only %.5 difference I actually think Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA is overall more flavorful than Pliney the E."
"OK, after being disappointed in the on-tap version in SD, I've got a couple of bottles to try. Appearance is a hazy yellow with a quarter-inch of head. Smells strongly of pine and herbs. Fantastic aroma. Taste is another matter--very bitter, with a medium citrus flavor and a decent malt component. Just a two-dimensional flavor, though, not much complexity. Could have used some more varied hop flavors in there. Very drinkable, but just not the world-class IPA I was expecting."
"D - Huge props to this one for being able to drink more than a few of these and wake up w/o a hangover. You still have to deal with the alcohol clearance in the morning though."
"Right from the bottle, pliny pours an awesome orange/amber color with a thick enduring head. The smell is almost better than the taste...almost. Very rich citrus, floral notes that make your mouth water in anticipation. This beer is hard to put down as it's loaded with super delicious hops that don't kick your tongue's ass. Velvety smooth with every drink. Most double IPAs leave that unpleasant tongue scraping taste on the back of your tongue long after drinking but Pliny leaves your mouth, stomach, and soul wanting more. Truly an inspiring brew. The bar has been set high with this ale."
"I've not tried Younger but I find it impossible that this beer could be improved upon. This beer is beyond all hype. If you love IPAs you will never return from it."
"Perfect. Wish this was available here, but alas."
"Pours a hazy amber colour with a thick white head. Great retention and lace. The smell is very powerfull. It hits you the minute you crack the bottle. Piney (or is that Pliny), grapefuity and floral. No malt detected in the aroma at all. Flavour mirrors the aroma with the addition of a slight grassy taste and an enormous, but not tragically agressive, bitterness. The malt flavour is very nuetral, its sole purpose to cut the hops so they dont burn your face off. Very, very dry finish. Has a lighter body (for a IIPA), which makes this a very drinkable beer. Wow, I could drink this all night, or at least try to. I dont believe its 8%. Good Stuff!"
"Drinkability is impressive considering the IBU and ABV, but still, a little overbearing to be an all-night session ale IMHO."
"Poured a surprisingly pale amber color with a huge foamy white head that leaves tons of Belgian lacing with every mouthful. I've been conditioned to expect a certain 'level' of color is required to achieve world class levels of mouth and flavor. This one convincingly shattering that myth, but i'd prefer a meatier color. The smell is aggressive, intense with floral piny resin and grapefruit. Hugely tangy with hops, the mouth feel is full bodied and compliments the flavor during and after taste. Full flavored the piny resin and grapefruit flavors explode and linger as anticipated. Interesting to taste RR IPA, Blind Pig and Pliny side by side. The fundamental elements flavor being the common thread...the difference really being the intensity in both the mouth and depth of flavor. Drinkability is a 4.75...i'm having a really hard time believing that this one is only 8% ABV. The intensity of the mouth and flavor textures hide the kick-in-the-as* that is inevitable. One of the best ales i've had the opportunity to experience...clearly topping off my venture to mecca. The real amazing thing about a Russian River sampler is the scope and breathe of their products. AMAZING!!!! and a worthy 500th review."
"Thought I'd give this another review now that it is readily available in Colorado. Picked up a bottle, plus its on tap at several different locations (woohoo!). Great hop aroma, slightly cloudy gold color with just a bit of red. Nice head retention. Amazing combination of a solid malt backbone with tons of hops. This one is an awesome addition to the great beer selection in Colorado, and I'm sure I'll be consuming quite a bit of it."
"D: A damn fine i2pa. The 8% is so well hidden. I am very pleased to be finding this and the pig all around the bay area!"
"Drinkability- For the style and abv, this beer goes down smooth and it's tough to pass on another after the first. I could see myself getting together with some friends, having a few pints of this, and making some bad decisions. Great stuff, but not my favorite DIPA. Having lived in the Midwest and the PNW, it takes something near perfect to """Wow!""" me in this style. Pliny comes really close, but falls short."
"D: Drink it. This beer is great. It looks and feels amazing. The flavor is damn near perfect. I think fresh, this beer would blow me away. Such a treat to enjoy and joy to have."
"D: I had been waiting to try this and it lived up to what I expected. It is almost too drinkable. I will be grabbing a few more of these while I can."
"Although I really enjoyed this beer, I think it may be getting a little more hype than it deserves. If there was a little more citrus or malt, just to counter the pine a little, it would be up there with the world-class beers."
"It has a healthy texture in the mouth and is not particularly dry. There is a nice crispness, which overall reasults in a very drinkable beer. I would recommend this to anybody that enjoys the pleasure of a well balanced beer that has plenty of hop flavor. I certainly see why people love this beer."
"Love it! Please bottle the Younger next for those of us who cannot just drop into the brewpub."
"I like this beer alot but this isnt the best offering from RR for me"
"you know, generally, i don't even care for pales, IPA's and DIPA's...etc. this is a testament to how excellent this beer is. good show."
"Purchased from the Belmont Station in Portland OR. on my first visit. The beer looks good with about one finger of head in a pint glass. Nose is about par for this style but I was expecting just a bit more from such a highly decorated brew. Taste is good and meets expectations. I do like my imperials to boast more hops and bitterness with some malty background and this just fell a wea bit short. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is good. Overall this is a really good IIPA, but not super great."
"Ok, yeah, this definitely lives up to the hype. Top notch DIPA for sure. Thanks again Kevin."
"very drinkable, but I'm a little disappointed with this dull middle flavor. Its not a bad flavor, it's fine, but not as interesting as I wanted."
"This was a fun beer! Cooper with a big white head. Fantastic citrus smells. Big grapefruit, lemon and the right amount of pine. Big hops but the sweetness on the finish balances it all. Extremely drinkable. I wouldn't mind this beer being easier to get. It could easily become one of my favorites."
"Pours a clear light copper/amber body with a frothy off white head and medium carbonation. Aroma is medium sweet with grapefruit, pine, bread and caramel sweetness. Flavor is grapefruit, pine and caramel. Very simple yet a wonderful blend. Medium to full body, thick texture. Sweet bitter/caramel flavor lingers nicely. Great beer!"
"Pretty good stuff. Alcohol is well hidden which could be dangerous. I would pick this up on occassion. My taste preference have shifted over the past year and a half, so I'm no longer focused on super hoppy beers like I used to be. I dont want to say this is overrated, but I've had other beers on the market that I thought were just as good as this one is."
"Pours copper with a huge fluffy head that falls to amazing lacing. The aroma is strong with floral hops. The flavor is vast, with grapefruit dominating, with a tea-like tannic finish. The mouthfeel is thin, slightly clingy. Delicious, well balanced with an apricot-like finish."
"I've got to get more of this stuff. It's up there with Old Rasputin for one of the best West Coast brews."
"Overall, just a sublime example of a DIPA. One of my favorites. Wish it was easier to get in Chicago. Guess I will have to settle with 3F."
"D- really easy to drink (except for the price)"
"Overall, a very good DIPA. But it didn't quite live up to its legendary billing. That said, I'm stoked to have had the opportunity to try it. You can't get it on the East Coast."
"Note: This is the only beer in my top 50 I am below the rdev on."
"Awesome stuff, if I could find it locally I would buy it by the case, growler, pint, keg, or any other vessel I could find. Highly recommended, and a must try for IIPA lovers."
"D : Real easy to drink but I was disappointed in it after seeing how highly rated it was. To me, it didn't have that something special to make it stand out as being the best of the imperial IPAs out there."
"It's a very good DIPA, has more hops than you'll ever need, and tastes great. It's just so bitter and acidic, that more than one bottle would leave you with a sour stomach. Definitely worth a buy though!"
"Tastes potent hop flavored with noticable hop bitter and decent underlying malt sweet. Hop flavor consists of pith, grapefruit, garlic, tangerine, and oranges. Hop flavor is so strong that it comes across as a bit sour. Hop bitter is grassy and mixes with a clean alcohol. The alcohol dries the beer, despite a malt dextrinous. Malt flavor is absent, or at least buried under all the hop character. Md-light body and moderate carbonation. Decent, but I'm not seeing what all the hype is about."
"Again I recommend this beer, but there are similar IPAs out there at a lower price."
"I'm very happy with this beer and will buy a case next time I see it."
"D: It was a wonderful IPA, among the best I've tasted. It is a bit strong for a session beer but I would have no trouble going two to three deep before being forced to go elsewhere."
"D: Because the bitterness down the throat is so controlled, this is perhaps the smoothest IPA I've had, ever. To be able to have this incredible hops aroma and taste without knocking your palate with a hammer is truly a first for me. My new favorite of this style."
"Although PTE is very good, I must admit I don't understand what the obsession seems to be. This is not a top 25 beer in my opinion."
"Notes: I think god's playing a big practical joke. I love my dry as hell, brilliantly balanced DIPAs, most of which are outta CA and he puts me on the East Coast. Between last night's fresh White Knuckle, tonight's Pliny and tomorrow's Dreadnaught, I'm in hophead's heaven."
"Please Note: Pliny changes quite a bit as it ages and really is best enjoyed as fresh as possible. I've sampled bottles that were 2-3 weeks old and they have extra bitterness about them that opens up in the 4-6 week age range. By about 10-12 weeks old this beer seems really degraded in my personal opinion."
"what else can i say this is the most wonderful DIPA i have ever had, too bad i live on the east coast and it will probably be hard to come by again."
"At 8% it is absolutely at the extreme end of my tolerance, so drinkability gets marked down just a touch. Can only have one pint of this if driving."
"I want one now as I'm typing this review. So in general I think I'd have to say its one of those beers you can and/ or are going to want to drink every day."
"Drinks pretty easy for the style & ABV, A pretty good DIPA, which I presume is even better on draft"
"I have had this beer numerous times on tap (at Russian River brewpub and locally in So. Cal), and a handful of times from the bottle now. This bottled version is close enough to the fresh tap version for me. Fresh tap might be just a bit more intense in flavor and aroma. But there's no debating with me that any DIPA even comes close to displaying the hops and not letting the the malt interfere too much and create a cloyingly sweet hop soup like plenty of other DIPA's out there. Ok, maybe it's neck and neck with Alpine's Pure Hoppiness :)"
"Pours a brilliant amber red with golden highlights. A pillowy head rises and falls to a finger thick disk. Lacing leaves draping patterns across the glass. Smells wonderful. Piney, resinous, buscuity malt, spearmint, hints of citrus. Beautifully balanced! First taste is very solid! Carmel sweetness, bready malts give way to piney, slightly spicy / peppery hops. Not incredibly complex but something amazingly simple about it strikes my fancy. Just the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. Soapy, solid mouthfeel. A highly drinkable DIPA from the guys who helped pave the road."
"Bottled on date: 7/30/08"
"Highly recommended."
"500mL bottle, purchased locally...whoo Hoo to that! 081308 bottling. It's a really nice beer. The hops blend into the malt so beautifully. Nicely sweet with an awesomely hoppy bitterness. Great balance, there is a reason this beer is one of those """must have, everyone talks about it, no really will you trade me some, ISO, etc. etc. etc.""" beers."
"So, if you are lucky enough to to get a pint, or six, of this wonderful nectar do not hesitate! Grab one and enjoy! Pliny the Elder is about as close to perfection as a West Coast DIPA gets! Kudos to Vinnie and the entire Russian River team for creating and brewing such a wonderful product!"
"Of course, having this on tap is where it's at, but trapping Pliny in the bottle is still damned good. One of my favorite DIPA's. It's a real treat to imbibe the elder."
"Pours dark amber brown with very nice white head. Aroma is sweet citrus and pine with a background of hops. Flavor begins with a great and unique palate of roasted nuts, almost like creamy peanut butter. Nice finish of hops and citrus. Great medium body, very easy to drink. Unique and amazing double IPA."
"Very good version of the style. I wish it was more widely available down here in the IE."
"This rocks. If you want to get something hoppy that isn't freakishly sweet or boozy, this is IT. This is *the* hoppy beer."
"As far as drinkability, there's a continuum, running between """session""" and """imperial.""" Those which advertise themselves as """imperial""" are far too strong to be drinking for hours on end. They are special examples of brewers' skill which should be sampled and enjoyed occasionally, and which most definitely don't lend themselves to excessive consumption. Though i wouldn't drink more...well, not much more...than a bottle's worth of this in a sitting, i can't get enough of it. I keep wanting to remind myself of the brilliance and complexity of this masterful beer, as well as to renew its flavor on the palate, which fades to a bitter (but not unpleasant) flavor of grapefruit rind, given a few minutes of typing without drinking. All in all, an impressive and unique take on the IPA style."
"drinkability: great"
"Now that Russian River distributes to Oregon, I get the chance to try this popular brew. Pours a beautiful copper color, thick white head with heavy lacing. Nice grapefruity aroma is just right. Taste is lots of citrusy bitter hops up front but seems to get piney as I drink more, low alcohol presence, and a healthy bit of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very sticky as a good DIPA should be. A very, very, very good beer. Well done Vinnie."
" Pliny The Elder is simply unrivaled among DIPAs. Perhaps my favorite beer of any style. My hat off and a full bow to Russian River Brewing Company for possibly one of the best ales I've ever come across."
"D - I'd drink this all nite, never get tired of it, but I think the abv would get the best of me. LOL So so very good tho and I must get more!"
"Overall- OK I'm not a big IPA fan but I did my best to judge this beer properly. I had hoped for more balance between hops and malts but as far as DIPAs go I would say this is one of the best I've ever had. At 8% it makes for a very drinkable(sessionable) beer and I'm extremely excited to have been able to try it. Big thanks go out to my boy Devon who brought this back from his trip to Napa."
"I must note that the bitterness keeps me from sipping it quickly, but the flavor and overall character cause me to keep wanting more."
"D - I could drink this one until bad things happened. Happy suds."
"Drinkability - Oh lordy... this is a fantastically easy drinking DIPA. The bitter does not overwhelm, and it sits just right on the tongue. I hope this is here to stay in Denver."
"This beer has a wonderful aroma and beautifuly complex hop characteristics. The complex hop characteristics is its most notable characteristic having filled your mouth with everything you want from a big IPA. If I was desserted on a dessert island... you get the point!"
"A benchmark DIPA. Thank goodness they built out that new brewery so we can get this in bottles whenever, wherever."
"Drinkability is high. Flavor is great, alcohol is unoticeable. Really phenomenal. Would really love to try on tap, and would like to try Younger even more."
"D- VERY drinkable. I'd be in trouble if it was on tap near by."
"Overall, an excellent and well balanced DIPA!"
"A beautifull brew, pours a rich copper brown with a silky tan head. Excellent lace. The nose has a great balance between the hops and sweet malts. The taste is very well balanced as well. Nice fruity citrus hops followed by sweet candy malt. Medium to full body compliments this IPA very nicely. Really a fantastic beer from Russian River. Can't wait to try the younger."
"Man, this is one bitter brew! I'm halfway done with my glass and the malt can still only be called as having a """meek""" role. Still, this one is and was all about the hops and in that, they've succeeded to the nth degree and I was just in the mood for a good, bitter DIPA but I don't think I could drink this on a regular basis as it's just palate """destroying""". I think I prefer Blind Pig but that's just me..."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer."
"the taste was incredible. smooth, with an amazing mouthfeel. i went from tasting the bite of the hops, to smooth earthy tones to zesty citrus. i had to put it down and go look at the beer selection to stop myself from guzzling down the rest of it. i could drink this beer for hours. i cant wait to go back in a few days and get some more."
"D: The bitterness on this beer is off the charts. I normally think of myself as someone who can handle just about anything that you can throw at me but I think this is just about the bitterest thing I've ever tasted, not bitter like a pickle is bitter but a sour, back of the throat kind of bitter that is unrelenting. In terms of style it is unparalleled, it is like nothing I've ever tried before, the further I get into this beer the more it changes, I keep wanting to go back again and again for another sip just to try and pull out more flavors. There is a grainy kind of taste that I think is a result of how bitter this beer is and it is slightly off putting but I've tasted it in other DIPAs before. This has been the hardest beer for me to judge. I'd say it lives up to the hype but unlike the Dreadnaught I think I'd be okay with just a bottle of this while I could drink the Dreadnaught all night long. But then again this beer is like nothing else I've ever tasted before, incredibly fresh and incredibly tasty."
"Huge thanks to Jason for the trade!"
"As stated earlier this beer may have converted me to IPA/DIPAs. I've tried many, but this one just seems to be right for me. I am very impressed by most of RR beers."
"Drinkability Easiest drinking dipa ive had by a very long shit, the abv is not noticeable what so ever"
"Medim body and leaves a solid hops after taste. Definitely for the hop-heads. A solid DIPA to be sure. I love how the label says this should be enjoyed fresh and not aged."
"d: I have been building this up in my mind and was worried I would inevitably be let down. Instead, my expectation have been surpassed. Buy this if you can. If you can't, I will trade, but damn it, if you have not had this beer, you need to, now. I guess I know what my Staff Pick will be at work."
"Pours a relatively clear light-copper/orange color, foamy off-white head loosely forms and fades pretty quickly, leaving a thin layer of foam with some bigger bubbles around the edge of the glass, nice patchy lacing. This is probably the most pine hop aroma I've encountered in a beer....piney hops just leap out of the glass, and pretty much dominate the nose, though there are some sweet malty aromas as well. Taste is just explosively hoppy....spicy, sticky, resinous pine taste, bitter grapefruit, tangerine, and some delicate caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel seems a touch thin for an Imperial IPA, but in the context of the flavors in this beer, it's perfect, with a slight stickiness, and lingering bitterness that doesn't overpower you. So glad I got this in a trade, and this is a beer that'll stay permanently on my """wants""" list. Should Russian River ever decide to distribute in MA, this would always be in my fridge. A glorious IPA!"
"D- Good price, not very rare around here I guess, saw it in a couple stores. Will be visiting this guy again."
"Must Have!!!"
"An excellent brew, but not my favorite Russian River. I actually prefer Younger and Blind Pig."
"Smell is awesome, resin, pine, hop essence. Taste is every good as bit as I remembered from the last one I had a month or two ago."
"Drinkability: No big sticky malt backbone here -just a hoplover's dream"
"More mad props go out to RblWthACoz for such a great trade!"
"Mouthfell was very smooth. This beer was worth the wait, it is very easy to drink and not a tweaked hop bomb I expected. Thats ok though, this beer kicked ass."
"Smooth is the only way to describe the mouthfeel on this bad boy. It somehow manages to feel soft and velvety yet crisp at the same time, with decent carbonation and a fairly heavy body. This is an awesome DIPA, I only wish I'd be around SoCal for a few days longer to find some more. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"Overall, this is a good DIPA, but not spectavular."
"Overall: lives up to the hype, can't wait to get my paws on the younger!"
"Drinkability...well I had 2 on an empty stomach and I could feel them after the 2nd one. You could drink 3 or 4 of these but it's a sipper for sure. Glad I had the chance to try it."
"To put it in beer perspective, if it was this or Hopslam, i'd definitely have a hard time choosing. I might give the edge to Hopslam strictly for the price. If it was this or Big Head, I would reach for the Big Head. I'm a homewtown boy :)"
"Its an orange straw colored body topped with an electric white creamy head that last and is a lace monster. The smell is simply dynamic. Its crazy pine and like every citrus fruit you can think of with a highlight on the sour ones, incredibly strong smell. The taste is more of the same with a sweet malt backdrop that is there if you pay attention. There are also some piney and grassy hop notes especially on the finish. Medium/full body with some hop oil. Well its pretty much all its cracked up to be, which is tough when there is so much hype."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and such high resinous hop taste that it just coats your mouth and leaves you with that bitter cant wait for me taste."
"D - Not sure I would order a second pint. It's good, but strong."
"Overall: The thing I enjoyed the most about this beer is the balance and complexity it had. Almost perfect."
"Similar taste, medium to full bodied, mostly hoppy and bitter just like the aroma suggested, but caramel and bread make some appearacnes to balance it a bit more. Nicely done, better balanced than the blind pig; both quite good, this one close to dreadnaught. Body is a bit lighter, not as much depth, but that also enhances drinkability."
"Qualms aside, I honestly wish I had more of this. It's a fantastic smelling, """lite""" Double IPA that is easy to put down. At 8% it'd make a killer mini-session beer. Pity it's not more available. Big thanks to Barronkr for sharing!"
"Drinkability: A great treat, drank fresh (as the bottle notes) and more often if not for the strength of the brew."
"Drinkability is excellent. I wish i lived next to russian river. at FOUR DOLLARS a bottle... i'd still be broke."
"poured from a bottle into a snifter. huge hops out of the bottle and in the glass. this bottle must be quite fresh. taste is all hops, strong citrus (mostly red grapefruit), light bitterness, but full flavor. bitter but very balanced. smooth in the mouth, lightly carbonated. little head when poured. if this was available, i would drink often, very often. i now understand the hype."
"This is the best double IPA, and one of the best beers, that I have ever had."
"D- Wow! This is one hell of a beer, and I would definitely put it in my top 5. Pliny The Elder is a world class DIPA, and well worth the hype."
"One of the best-a stellar example of the style."
"I can not say this beer lives up to its hype, but it is definitely my style of DIPA. It is not overly sweet like a lot DIPA's can be, but very well balanced with a very fragrant dose of hops."
"This beer pours a very hazy orange color with a decent sized solid white head. The head died down a bit, but it left patchy lacing on my tulip glass. The nose on this beer is very fresh and vibrant. The citrus scent is the most dominant with plenty of earthiness and pine scents nipping at the heels of the citrus scent, but no malt to really speak of in the nose. The flavor profile starts out with loads of hop bitterness leaning towards pine bitterness with the citrus fruit and tropical fruits flavors really coming in about mid-drink. The flavors are very pronounced, but they do not overpower you in anyway, but rather combine for a very pleasant flavor profile. The initial rush of hop bitterness if huge, but somehow the finish is soft and clean. I am very surprised as well at how low the malt flavor is, but still supports the hops brilliantly. The drinkability is really amazing for a DIPA with the alcohol well hidden, and I would have gladly had another bottle of this beer."
"This may be the best beer I have ever had. I am going to have another tonite to make sure, and I am really looking forward to it!!"
"very refreshing, delicious beer, dangerously drinkable for 8%. one of the firat west coast hop bombs i have had, and now 90 minute has competion as my favorite beer."
"This beer is incredibly crafted, and leaves me yearning to try its younger brethren. Russian River does well with this, and I'm glad it finally made it to bottles, else I would have never had this opportunity. The pleadings on the bottle (drink this fresh!) are definitely worth heeding, and I wish I'd drank this even closer to its bottled-on date."
"Pours a very nice slightly hazy orange/yellow with a wonderful stark white head. The nose is pure citrus and pine hop flavors, and slight maltiness. Taste is simply exceptional. Not too heavy, not too light, very balanced. crisp, clean. Pure. Any hophead knows what I mean when I say that. citrusy hops abound. Mouthfeel is just about perfect. If anything I would say it could be the tiniest touch thicker, but I sat and debated whether or not to give the feel a 4.5 or a 5 for about 10 minutes. fantastically smooth, and defenitely one of, if not the, most drinkable DIPA I have ever consumed. It literally took me about 5 minutes to drink this. (good thing I have another one!) Totally refreshing, and beautifully smooth. A wonderfully crisp and pure brew. Art at its finest, defenitely my favorite RR brew as of yet. Beatification is great, Deviation was amazing, but this beer, is simply perfectly ideal for the style. Deserving of the hype, and worth seeking out. Hope to see this one continue to be bottled well into the future. Thanks again to Tim for these. Incredible brew."
"I have wanted to give Pliny a go since I've been active on this site and I'm glad I finally get the opportunity to do so. Although I gave this beer good reviews I can't help but be a little disappointed after all the looking forward I've done over the years. I was looking for a total hop bomb but this beer fell a little short. I guess if the anticipation around sampling this beer wasn't so high for me I would have given it a better review but it is still an excellent beer."
"D: Interesting - but a bit one dimensional."
"Pours a light amber in color with a huge, ginormous 4 inch head. I could smell the deluge of hops as soon as I popped the cap and began to pour. Smell is amazing. Very citrusy, juicy, bittering hops. Taste is much the same, but comes across much more balanced than the smell would lead you to believe. Good mouthfeel and very nice lacing on the glass. Glad I finally got the chance to try this behemoth. It definitely deserves it's spot up there with HopSlam, Dreadnaught and Hop 15. My dream would be a blind tasting with all these on draft!"
"Aromatics are pleasant, but this does not transfer to the tongue. Soapy and bitter. I have wanted to get my hands on this for sometime and it did not deliver. There is nothing that makes me go """Wow!""". No complexity, nothing to savor, nothing that entices the palate, nothing that slakes the thirst. Huge let down."
"Taste continues with the hop assault, which is very much to my liking. Herbal hop bitterness up front. Citrus and pine hop flavors follow. Cat pee, pepper, and tangerine around the edges. Tropical fruit and sugar cookie malt sweetness fight through, but just barely, and only for a moment. Herbal bitterness comes on strong with marmalade, pineapple, aspirin, and more pines sap. Wow. After a quarter of the bottle, my tongue is already numb. Orange sorbet and apricot in the finish with long-lasting bitterness and hints of fruit cocktail. Medium-bodied with a moderately creamy feel. I almost wish there was a little more body. A hophead's dream and I'm glad I have another bottle in the fridge!"
"The world is a better place with Pliny available in bottles to take home."
"D: Awesome. I could drink a half-gallon."
"D: I can't in good faith give this less than a 4.5. This beer is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. Perhaps the most highly recommended beer I've ever rated."
"A bit oily and chewy in the aftertaste, but the big juicy flavors just make me want to keep drinking it and never stop...thus i only experience the aftertaste once :)"
"Big, big thanks to jhenry04 for the help with this and others."
"Received this in a trade and am glad I got it. This is my first Russian River selection and they have lived up to the top billing they have gotten on this site. I can't wait to try more selections from Russian River and my only regret is that I can't get any of these around here."
"Pliny the Elder pours a brilliant orange color with slight haze and a creamy sticky off white head. The nose is heaven, loads of fresh resiny hops, lots of grapefruit and citrus, beautiful. The taste is immensely hoppy and wonderful. This definitely one of the best DIPAs i've had to date. Notes of pepper, citrus, peaches, apricot, and a solid malt back bone balanced with the perfect amount of alcohol heat. Its medium body is perfect, just the right mouth feel for the style, not overly syrupy and barleywine-like. The aftertaste is semi-sweet and malty with a long lingering cannabis, resiny hop finish. awesome. I could drink this all the time."
"I love this beer, it converted me to the stronger hop levels years ago. It still draws me in today and with every sip reminds me of why I loved it in the first place. IMO the soul of hops is captured and turned into ambrosia for this brew. One of my forever beer-drinking staples."
"I was expecting this beer to be good. Damn good at that. But, it's actually a little better than I was even expecting. I'm skeptical by nature and don't buy into hype too often. This one's not hype. All substance. Easily among the top DIPAs I've had the pleasure of trying. Seek this one out."
"Pours a clear rich amber color with 1 finger of soap foamy slightly off-white head. Good retention and nice lasting thick fluffy sticky lacing that coats the glass as the liquid leaves. Smells of grapefruit, honey, biscuit, oranges, lemon rind, and pine. Taste packs loads of citrus up front with grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon, and tangerine followed by a solid honey and biscuity malt backbone. The finish oozes pine and some spicy hops with a wee bit of alcohol. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation throughout. Smooth but with bite. Lots of citrus notes up front with a sweet and malty middle and a great bitter foresty finish. A great DIPA with lots of different hop flavors that don't compete for dominance, instead work together to make an incredibly flavored beer. Dangerously easy to drink as the alcohol is well hidden."
"Big thanks yet again to RblWthACoz for the surprise, absurdly generous hookup."
"Pours a basically clear gold amber with a half inch creme head in my snifter. Strong soapy, floral nose. Minor perfume tones. Flavor is just smooth. And I mean unbelievably smooth. I don't think I have ever had a DIPA so smooth to date. Hoppy, yes. But the character isn't trying to scream at me. Soapy hops. Floral tones and minor citrus is there too. Feel is smooth with a good combo of liquid and carbonation. This is truly an amazing DIPA. Its beauty lies in its drinkability. It's so smooth and really an amazing mature recipe. It doesn't have to scream in your mouth to make a point. Rami at Healthy Spirits says he likes it on-tap just a little bit more than the bottle. Oh really?? Well...add that to the list of things to seek out and try."
"D: This is a world class example of a DIPA and probably the new standard for me. Big, big thanks to Praveen for hooking me up with this."
"The aroma of this beer is just so nice; the dominant hop fruit notes are perfectly controlled by the softer herbal hop character. The flavor is a bit more herbal in balance and is quite scathing in its hop attack. Still the bitter, sharply herbal hop notes never get out of control, but this beer still makes me feel like my tongue has been abused and scraped raw by the aggressive hop character. This is most definitely a well constructed brew, and in some aspects this is quite definitive for the style. A benchmark for the style that I will never get enough of."
"D- Highly recommended here. This is a great brew, easy to drink and tastes awesome."
"d: a truly exceptional DIPA that may be better on the bottle then from the tap"
"This one didn't WOW me for all the hype that it gets? One guy at the bar said this year's brew wasn't as good as it use to be. Maybe the hop shortage change the recipe slighty? I would still drink this brew again next year!"
"Hop flavor is intense and lasting. Bitterness is also strong though not so much as some other DIPAs. What Pliny has that other IIPAs lack is a great balance. Despite its hoppiness and alcoholic strength, the beer is very drinkable. I could definitely order 2-3 pints."
"However, I'm thoroughly underwhelmed on the taste. I wasn't expecting a hop bomb, but at a supposed 100 IBU's I was expecting a little more kick than this. It's mostly full of pine notes, that really linger on afterwards, which is my favorite part about the taste. The mouthfeel is everything a DIPA should be, with a medium-full body and solid carbonation. Overall, the aftertaste makes it a very enjoyable sipper, but I don't feel that it lived up to it's rep."
"On tap at Liars Club. Bright gold with a creamy white head. Very floral with lots of orange and grapefruit. Flavor is very bitter and hoppy with bready malts and some sweetness to keep everything well balanced. This beer starts to get very good about halfway through the pint as it warms up. Sticky resin, pine and tropical fruit. Dry bitterness in the finish. This beer is always the first one to kick at the Oregon Brewers Fest."
"So incredibly drinkable. I couldn't detect the ABV at all and just zoomed through the first pint of this one. An exceptional DIPA."
"Overall this is the beer of gods, and for that it will garner my first perfect 5. This is a perfect beer in it's fresh state. I reviewed Pliny from a keg that was tapped here on the east coast, but it didn't hold a candle to the fresh Pliny. All I can say is I was blown away. Thanks again to ricand for allowing me to enjoy this perfect beer."
"M&D: Medium to full body. Just the right amount of carbonation makes the mouthfeel excellent. At 8% ABV the Elder (a DIPA) is as drinkable as any single IPA out there. Bottom line, Pliney the Elder should be in the disscusion of the best beers in the world. Just plain awsome! Skal."
"This beer arrived shimmering golden orange in my half-liter mug with a big frothy head on top. The nose found sharp bitter citrus and hops. As for the taste, thsi should be renamed """Piney""" the Elder, because there are a lot of piney notes in this bittersweet offering, but leaning towards being bitter. Hop flavors are sharp to the palate with a bite of grapefruit peel and a touch-up of ripe fruit. Surprisingly, this beer is """just right""" in mouthfeel and drinkability; not heavy at all, so you can take on another pint voluntarily if you wanted to."
"Conclusion: Great beer and definitely worthy of the hype. I like the Elder, but I did enjoy the Younger a bit more. But don't let that fool you, get it when you can!"
"Not quite as thick and gooey as I like an IPA, but it more than makes up for it in flavor. Each sip was incredible, losing some of the potent piney thing going on and giving way to floral sweetness and sweet, bitey hops. World class."
"Rerate of fresh bottle 6 years later. My tastes have changed. This stuff is too syrupy, even though its pretty dry flavorwise, and more bitter than enjoyable. Gives me the absolute worst headaches too. Ugh..."
"Pours golden with a two finger head. Crisp hops in the aroma that follow through to the taste. Surprisingly drinkable given how hopped this thing is, it really is one of the best beers I've ever had the chance to try. Vinnie has got the IPA recipe down, can't wait to see this in bottles."
"Thanks again for the rare mid-west opportunity to try this fresh one, Pimpp!"
"I've had this on tap at the Russian River brewpub numerous times, and always bring a growler home. If I had to pick a single favorite beer this would probably be it. Rich gold in color, with reddish tints. The nose is astounding: pineapple, pleasantly musty grass- and pine-sap aromas, grapefruit, some of the kind of vanilla-ey aromas that you find in oaky chardonnay, along with funky tropical fruit scents---passionfruit, or even durian, though not overwhelming. With wines or beers, I'm a sucker for an interesting aroma, and this is definitely a beer worth swirling again and again to reactivate the olfactory blast. Flavors of passionfruit and grapefruit, with piney hops. All of Vinnie's high-hop offerings remind you that a simple IBU number doesn't really tell the story---this has got to be at 90 or more, but it's so well structured and balanced that you really don't taste """bitterness""" or """hoppiness""" per se. Instead the hops and malts create a structure that allows an amazing range of flavors to play across the palate with crystalline definition (this general point goes for the Younger, and RR's other hopped-up offerings as well). The mouthfeel is crisp and not at all cloying, but does have a noticeable tongue-coating quality. It's worth noting that while this beer is classed as an IIPA, it's far less heavy in body than most of the others of the type, and while the intensity of flavors definitely puts it in that category, it has a clean medium-bodied profile that drinks more like a regular, if mind-blowing, IPA. The finish is clean, bitter-grapefruit-rindy, and lingering. Two comments: 1. Thanks! 2. Never stop making this stuff!"
"D - Overall, this is definitely one of the easiest drinking and most flavorful DIPAs out there. Usually this style of beer has trouble reaching a balance as the beer is either all hops or all malt. This one manages to bring the hops without being overpowering at all. There was also not even a hint of the 10% ABV in this bad boy which became a bit dangerous as I glasses continue to be filled. Overall a great RR Brew."
"Overall, this is a brilliant beer and deservedly so of its ranking."
"D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easy, not too filling, strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is one of those highly regarded beers with a hyped reputation that is good enough to deserve every bit of it."
"D- I really like this beer. Again no hophead here but I really enjoyed the chance to try this brew."
"From growler shipped to me (6 days old when opened): Golden in color with a touch of amber. This still poured a great 3/4""" head that dissipated slowly. Strong scents of pure hops, pine and grapeftuit. The palate shows the hops more than the """Blind Pig""" and is drier but not necessarily any more bitter. Again, this is a very well balanced beer that has a bit more of everything than the """Blind Pig"""."
"The flavor was great, it coated your tongue with sweet grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine while a bitter citrus rind aftertaste slowly built up. This was very full-flavored, yet oh-so drinkable - a dangerous combination. It never felt that bitter, but by the time my glass was empty, I was feeling it."
"Pliny The Elder poured a bautiful hazy golden orange with a nice creamy 1/2 inch head of white foam. This head of foam had excellent retention that left behind a small white film and tons of white lace around around the glass. The aroma was very potent with citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, a slice of lemon, a touch of grass, and then all this ended with more citrus hops. If there was any malt in here, it was beaten down by all the hoppy aromas. The taste was just filled to the brink with pine, citrus hops, a touch of lemon, grapefruit,and more citrus hops. I noticed that at the end, there was some alcohol, but this alcohol tasted like it was infused with pine and citrus hops. Even the alcohol couldn't get away from being hoppy and piny. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied with a powerful aftertaste of citrus hops, pine, and grapefruit. This aftertaste will linger on your tongue for quite a long time. It was nothing short of being a wonderful hoppy beer. If I could, I would drink this one again at the drop of a hat."
"Pours a clear copper-yellow with a small, brief, frothy head. As expected for the style, the nose is huge hops, but with more complexity than I'm used to in a DIPA. pine galore, but hints of grapefruit, lemon, green apple, grass, and some spicyness pull through. Palette leans more towards the citrusy zest side, with a lemon and grapefruit tartness being the dominant flavor profile. We get the expected hoppy bitter punch at the end (although it isn't overpowering), along with a mild alcohol warmth that finishes nicely. Mouthfeel is full, but not too sticky or syrupy (my personal pet peeve of the style). Overall, a dynamite DIPA, with a greater complexity and balance than any other DIPA I've tried so far."
"Vinny is a superhero."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to Fishdawg71 for the growler & pounder glass!"
"But my God, you'll enjoy that one or two."
"Thanks to Beertracker for the taste. Poured out of a less than one month old growler. Really nice head with somewhat low carbonation. Golden straw color. Smells of BIG multi-dimensional hops, focusing mostly on pine. Some sweet maltiness in there too. Smell is so strong as it could give the faint of heart a nose bleed. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Tingles the tongue as is swirls around. Some malt sweetness discernable. Slightly viscous. Hops all through out and leaves the tongue feeling vibrant and alive. Not totally unbalanced but definitely destroys the taste buds in a good way. Really mellows as it warms, becomes almost winelike. An exceptionally great beer that I look forward to having again."
"-Kevin."
"Its a good beer, I used to drink it all the time, then stopped for a year or so, when I came back to it because of all the chitter chatter on this site, I was let down. It was a better beer in my head. I go to the toronado often, and order it once or twice a year only. That being said, if you want to try a big california IPA, this wouldnt be a bad one to start with."
"Lovely stuff. Didn't produce much of a head and has a nice fragrance, though not overpowering. Big hops so that you find yourself clicking your tongue against your pallet for a few seconds after a nice big gulp. You like a big Left Coast IPA? Then you will like this."
"I could have really hurt by self drinking too much of this beer -- This beer is too goo to be so far away and hard to get a hold of at my house."
"D- Not sure I could drink more than one. Not a session beer for me, definitely great after a nice pub meal."
"This is pretty good DIPA but IPAs really aren't my thing."
"On draft at the Toronado. Golden color, great clarity. Off-white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Strong aroma of hops (resin, pine, citrus, ammonia). Initial flavors are hops: resin, citrus, pine. Noticable ammonia notes as well. Strong alcohol flavor kicks in after a few seconds. Toasty malt notes also apparent. Nice bitter finish. Medium body, Moderate carbonation. Nice long, smooth finish for an 8% beer. Some alcohol warmth and dry finish from abundant hops. A strong beer, but very drinkable considering the high hopping level and fairly high alcohol level. Most excellent."
"A phenomenal DIPA. One of my favorite beers of all time. Pours a pretty standard red/copper color, with a white head. Reaks of floral hops. Has a strong floral hop taste, with a nice malt backbone sweetness that is always present but is cotnrolled by the hops. The beer coates your mouth with a sticky hop feel. While drinking many of these can be dangerous, I often find myself putting back quite a few, and so I would say it is very drinkable."
"Pours from a growler into a honeycomb mug. Carbonation traveled well equaling a three finger off white head that sits like a foamm brick. It slowly settles leaving a ton of lace. Body is a golden honey straw in color. Nose is big and fresh with notes of flowery citrus, which is almost creamy with piney alchol notes that really get the taste buds going. On first sip a rush of creamy hops attack the tongue. This hop feel quickly becomes incredibly dominent with long bitter feel coating the entire mouth. This beer really has a good thing going with an effect as the only thing that satisfies the bitter mouthfeel is another sip. There is a bit of a malt feel that adds a bit of balance as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is a long and even almost creamy hop bitterness. Drinkability is nice as each sip rewards the last and beckons the next."
"had it at Toronado today. Seems like everybody was ordering Pliny's or Reality Czech's. Just wanted to get my rating in for this near-perfect drinking experience. after reading the hop schedule for this beer, I am amazed at how wonderfully balanced it is. I never got the feeling I was merely chewing grapefruit pith. Truly deserving its status as a top world beer. Exquisite."
"Drinks easily, the alcohol is very well-masked. It's bitter, but not overly so, and tastes too good to pause too long between sips."
"D:Frickin amazing."
"Drinkability>Excellent"
"Drinkability rates high, for me. I can see how many people would be put off by the loading of the hops, but I loved it. It was definitely a beer to be savored."
"D- Wonderfully hoppy DIPA that lives up to its reputation, well-balanced and complex hop bouquet, the alcohol is well-masked, I could drink this all night long but the extreme hops could be a barrier for others"
"It was a great beer and I can't wait to try it again."
"This beers all about the hops. It is an awesome showcase of all the modern hop strains descendent from Cascade. Delicious amounts of Simcoe, Columbus & Centennial. No strong esters; nice clean alcohol flavors from the White Labs California Ale yeast. Strong, Hoppy, Dry finish. Let it warm up a bit before you drink it and youll taste the complexity. Everything I want in an IPA."
"This has to be the best tasting and easy going double ipa I have ever had.You Cant taste the 8% abv in it at all.I will sell my moms for another growler of this.Sorry mom"
"Medium bodied with low carbonation (prob from the filling problem) but this didnt adversely affect the overall affect. Alcohol is completely masked. Pretty bitter, it would be tough to drink a lot of this if it wasn't so damn delicious. I would always drink more of this."
"On tap at Capone's today in Norristown, PA...right next to Founder BReakfast Stout and Bell's Expedition. Awesome. Pours orange, slightly hazy. Nice compact foamy head. Smells like citrus, fresh cut gras, huge hops, summit? Simcoe? whatever they are they smell fantastic. Taste is tremendously flavorful. Massice punch of grapfruit and hops. Malt body is substantial and creamy. hops linger and bitterness is unrelenting. delicious. Creamy and full bodied. Melds well with the bitterness...an amazing beer that lives up to the hype and that is absolutely made to be freshly poured from a tap."
"Overall- Very smooth for 8%. Highly drinkable and tasty."
"D- I find that every sip is a revelation, plus it is pretty strong. I can only drink about 3 or 4 of these max, but quite drinakable for such a complex beer."
"D: Yeah... this beer is heavenly if you like good clean refreshing hops"
"M/D: I've had IIPA's that were simply too oily/syrupy to be highly drinkable, but PtE manages to cram in all that creamy/oily/thick body, and then finish really damn clean, and invite you back for another slug before you realize it."
"D - Really great, very drinkable double IPA. Very clean and tasty, and easily drinkable. I'm sure that directly off the tap this beer would even be more enjoyable."
"Scott"
"D: Not the best DIPA I've had, but a damn fine example anyway. Glad I got the chance to try this."
"Poured copper orange color with nice sticky head with scents of the herbal pine of Norcal with hints of citrus. Taste more grapefruit pine flavor with nice balance between very bitter hoppiness and sweet maltiness. That where this beer shines the most. Mouth feel nice smooth feel that helps with the flavor to mask the 8% alcohol content. This helps make it very drinkable but becareful because this one will pack a nice punch."
"Pours an orange brownish color with a frothy and creamy white head that builds up several inches in the glass. Lacing is left along the side of the glass as this one is consumed. Smell is of herbs, perfume, earthy, and pine, with some citrus notes. Taste is at first hoppy and citrus, but finishes with a moderate bitter finish. Mouthfeeling is a bit oily and maybe syrupy as well."
"Pours a surprisingly golden color for a DIPA with lively carbonation and a sizable head that laces throughout the entire pint. Smells like bready sweet malt and fresh juicy hops. Taste is as it smells, big juicy hops with a huge rush of balancing malt. Medium at most in the mouth with good carbonation. Rediculously drinkable for a DIPA!! No abv apparant, just some hop juice to brighten my day."
"D- For an 8 percent abv brew this went down extremely smooth. I drank it so fast in fact that I definitely was feeling the alcohol afterwards that I didn't taste. All in all a great DIPA."
"Full bodied and creamy. Very refreshing and wonderfully balanced, more so than other double IPAs."
"This is the classic Double IPA or Imperial IPA if you prefer. The hop aroma is so strong you will smell it before you raise the glass to taste it. While the aroma is overpowering it balances the intensly strong hop flavor present in the beer. The malt and bitterness balance in nearly perfect. Be careful of the excessivly (but to style) alcohol in the beer! If you like double IPAs this is a great beer to try."
"Overall - What a wonderful culmination of time and effort from Russian River. This beer warrants all of the accolades it receives and will continue to impress craft beer lovers for ages to come."
"Pours a beautiful coppery color. Tough to find, but excellent."
"Gotta try this if you are a fan of IPAs, or just want to try one of the best beers in the world in general"
"Pours a mostly clear copper hue with a lot of bubbles racing to the top that create a perfect fluffy white one finger head that stays around until the very end. Stickiness is everywhere on the glass. Smell has all hop scents mixed in; evergreen pine, grapefruit/lime citrus, and earthy hops. Caramel malt does make an appearance, just enough to balance the huge hop character. Taste starts off with a tiny bit of alcohol but is quickly taken over by the huge citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit, lemon, lime, oranges with a good pine undertone. With how much hop is present on the tongue, this beer isn't dry or very bitter at all. Caramel malt is actually quite noticable for such a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium bodied bordering on full with a whole lot of constant carbonation. Creamy DIPA which is a very enjoyable in every aspect. For 8% abv this one goes down very easy. Get your hands on this one for sure. I would definitely love to try the Younger, see how that compares."
"Lovingly consumed at Father's Office. A fair color for an IPA, coppery, and with abundant head. Retention was respectable, but not enviable. Smell was grassy, and alive with sweet malt and sticky hops. Taste was nectary, caramel with a fine blend of hops, with center stage shared beautifully between pine and citrus characters. Mouthfeel was rich and malty, but very clean. Unarguably, this is one hell of an IPA."
"Overall Impression: Hyped? Its a good IPA, double is subjective. No flaws, chock full of hops, but I just didnt wow. Im thinking that D/IPAs are to the West Coast as Mild Cask Ale is to the UK. Maybe there is a subtleness that Im missing. I love me some hops, but this just struck me as a good, not great beer."
"D: A bit more drinkable compared to most other DIPAs due to its subtler hoppiness, but also more filling due to its thick mouthfeel and full flavor. I could do a couple pints in a night, but any more would be labored."
"Flavour-wise, this one is all about balance, balance, balance. Pine, grapefruit, oily hops, and alcohol balanced out by caramel, vanilla, and lots of bready and crackery malt. Very yin-yang, but still leaning towards the hops a bit. Massive amount of flavour, you can't help but hold this one in your mouth for a bit and savour it. Mouthfeel stings a bit with the high acidity, very sticky. Medium body, medium carbonation, dry as hell. I could drink this all night long, no joke, screw the 8%, I'll just hurt in the morning, It'll have been worth it, and I would taste hops forever and ever and ever."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable for a DIPA, largely because it's not particularly alcoholic. I think you can enjoy this with almost any type of food."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, even for an 8% beer, it's so delicious, you'll keep wanting more, Russian River is doing great things in the world of craft beer, I can't wait to see what they try next. In conclusion, this is a great craft beer and Double IPA, worthy of its accolades."
"In my experience there is something about Russian River's beers that just do it for me. Its not that they are doing any thing that much crazier or more out landish than any other brewery, its that they are doing it more tastefully, this is of course my opinion and subject to change in the future, but for now I love you russian river. Nothing is over done and nothing is under attended to."
"This is the ultimate DIPA, so fresh and tasty, and while very fragrant, the hops don't beat up the palate at all. It was my first and last pint of the night, and truly memorable. Can't wait until they start distributing this up here!"
"D: Whew, this can only achieve a good '4""" because of the harshness of the bittering and the overpowering hops. My tastes are for a more balanced DIPA; this is a hop-head's dream beer. Definitely worthy of the high praise, personally not one I'd have too often..."
"This is very hard to find but the next time I come across this, I will nothesitate to get another."
"On tap at Toronado in SF, this fine ale only bolstered my East Coast awe at the very name of Russian River. The bartender told me that it was an IPA, so I was surprised to read that it was 8% ABV, as it went down so easily. The beer's real strength is in its masterful hop bouquet (pine, mango, grapefruit) which fills one's nostrils to the brim, yet relents when hitting the tongue. Extraordinarily well balanced, these mighty hop flavors part, allowing the sweet bready malts to emerge. The only hop flavor to make it to the finish line is the resinous pine, which (in the humble opinion of this reviewer), keeps this beer from perfection. Aside from that bitterness, the mouthfeel manages to be creamy & crisp, a remarkable feat, and this ale goes down incredibly easy. Bravo!"
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"All in all, this was a huge beer. It was unquestionably one of the hoppiest and most bitter double IPA's I have sampled, and also one of the most flavorful."
"Lived up to my high expectations and then some. Absolutely spot on with the aroma and taste! Well worth seeking out or making the trek to Santa Rosa for."
"D: I would power through an entire growler of this stuff if I could keep from passing out. Top notch beer."
"D - A very excellent DIPA, not the best, but one the best"
"Eric-"
"Fabulous stuff."
"Crystal clear, light golden color with a soft, well-retaining, white head. The smell is nothing short of a joyous occasion; some pine resin, lemon, grapefruit, and some extra dankness that reminds one of the tropics. Bitter, resinous pine greets the tongue leading to some lemon and grapefruit, followed by more of the pine resin. Incredibly bitter, yet the hop flavor still overpowers the pure bitterness of it. Soft carbonation at about medium levels, body is medium with lingering hoppy finish. Crazy drinkable. Love this stuff and I wish I had an easier access to it."
"Pours a beautiful head that retains and I think it actually gains more head as it sits there with a shampaign-like carbonation. Color is light golden to gold. Head is thick head with a great great lacing. The smell of hops is fruity and citrus-y. The balance of hop character is very nice. I smell sweet orange and some slight lemon flavors in the backround. The taste is very hoppy and light in body. This is a more drinkable beer than I ever imagined. It's like a beer you could sit down and just drink 4-5 and love every minute of it. Mouthfeel is very good and the bubbles make a silky mouthfeel that's wonderful. Overall I wish I could have a keg of this every couple of months."
"Much thanks go out to wcudwight for the chance to finally sample this brew."
"The drinkability is excellent - I could drink these all day. (I wouldn't be able to taste anything else - but who cares?)"
"Even with an 8%abv this is still a great session brew."
"Thanks to Talisker for the growler! Poured a crisp amber with a decent head that was mostly lasting and left spotty lacing. The aroma was of extremely fragrant earthy hops with some sweet malts. The taste was one of the most well-balanced beers I've ever had. An abundance of citrus hop flavor with just enough sweet malt for it not to overpower like many DIPAs do. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol is well hidden, just enough to provide some warmth. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. If only they'd expand their distribution some, since I love the Wild Ales as well."
"Many thanks to RedwoodGeorge for going above and beyond in the spirit of BA in bottling this one for transport. I am fortunate to have made his acquaintance."
"D: I'd been waiting to try this beer and I had a lot of expectations and it met and exceeded every one. An incredibly smooth, balanced and drinkable beer. The flavors are all wonderful and work perfectly together. A flat-out excellent beer. I just wish they bottled it so I could get my hands on it more often."
"One of my favorite beers. Best Double IPA in my opinion. Two hours to obtain this beer is a very small price to pay."
"A poor food choice (szegediner krautfleisch, a dish full of hot and mild paprika, large pieces of garlic, long-simmered kraut and tender pieces of pork loin) on my part rendered the other beers I was sampling (the Younger included) watery and bland, but this beer still cut through. Prudence said to hold off on further sampling until after dinner. My favorable impression of the beer improved once all those big spicy flavors were washed away by some water. To my taste there was a nice sweet malty backbone to the beer that supports the hops, there is clearly some alcohol there but it is well masked and ends up with a slightly drying quality to the finish. The 8% does decrease long-term drinkability, but treated with appropriate respect. Oh, wow. Amazing stuff."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very creamy smooth medium body. The carbonation is perfect. The flavors mesh together very well. This was a most excellent beer drinking experience. I split the growler with my wife and was sorry I had to split it. I think I could have drank several of these back to back. In summation this is bliss in a glass."
"Drinkablility: I could drink this beer all day everyday for the rest of my life. Well worth the 4 hour drive it took to procure this keg."
"The more balanced of the 2 Plinys. A serious winner."
"This was my favorite of the pliney's. The beer was a nice orange in color and there was a fair head. The smell is absolutly wonderfull. Sweet hops abound. The taste was very hoppy too with bitterness but not chemical like bitterness. Just a nice sweet hoppy beer that I would certainly drink daily if I could. The mouthfeel was nice and sticky and the beer was well balanced, even at 8%. This beer is worth the hype and I would advise you to try it if you like hops. I will most likely try to obtain more of this in the future."
"On tap at Toronado, Ben n Nicks, Liars Club, OBriens and too many times to count, so its about time I review my boy, Pliny. Pours golden and slightly amber-ish with a nice, rock steady head. Sticking your nose in the glass in one of the true pleasures in craft beer - lots of sweet, fruity hops and caramel malt in a near perfect symphony. Tastes like it smells, only better. Resinous, sweet citrus hop candy with just the right balance of caramel and biscuity malts. It glides across your tongue and finishes super clean, a bit dry and with no alcohol burn. For me, this beer defines everything a IIPA should be. Extremely drinkable, sessionable - a brewing masterpiece. My favorite/#1/ if stuck on a deserted island beer of choice."
"D- I think this is REALLY good! First time I tried it (just had a sip) I think I missed A LOT! Glad I got to try this again. VERY nice! Maybe my favorite DIPA."
"Overall: A truely great beer. Much more balanced and drinkable than its younger brother. The two most incredible things about this beer are the great hop quality and the amazing balance. Definately a beer I would put in my all time top 10."
"his was on-draft in a 16 oz glass from the Russian River Brewpub in Santa Rosa. I have heard a lot about this, so was looking forward to seeing if it lived up to its reputation. The brews were all listed in various color chalks on a board behind the bar, and according to it this one checked in at 92 BUs and 8% ABV. When it was set in front of me I could smell the hops from two feet away. This one is potent! The odor just leaps out of the glass with piney and floral hops. You dont need to take a big sniff to get what is going on here. Besides the hops, there are also some wonderful rich malts, nuts toffee, caramel, and fruit. I cannot imagine a beer smelling any better than this. As a pub pour it came without any head, but after drinking off the first inch, and almost swooning in the process, I swirled it and got a nice fat off-white head that left lots of fat chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass. A beautiful light orange, this is a feast for the eyes and as the head slowly settles down you are so taken by its overall beauty you almost hate to disturb it. The flavor is similar to the nose, and while the malts and the hops dominate, there is a serious bitter finish worthy of a DIPA. The mouthfeel was excellent, very rich and creamy and simply glides across the teeth and tongue. It tastes just as good going down the pipe as it did at first sip. The brew is simply incredible. It has that wonderful bitterness that all great DIPAs should have, and hides the alcohol very well. It is too bad this is only available on tap, because I would love to share this with my friends so they can appreciate it also. I have been saving a score this high for just a brew like this. Ranks with the best beer I have every had the pleasure of drinking. Maybe Pliny the Younger will be that perfect 5.0 if I ever get to taste it"
"This beer was hand bottled by RedwoodGeorge and the quality of the bottling and packaging is impeccable."
"starts surprisingly light and balanced, with a medium, slippery body and a gentle carbonation. a hint of balance and a slight honey sweetness, until the finish is overwhelmed with a nicely abrasive, but impressively nuanced, grassy and hoppy bitterness that lingers. very drinkable, in spite of its impressive hop profile; the growler may not last the two nights i'd hoped it would. drinkability weakens slightly as the beer warms; i think it needs to be a little colder to take a touch of the edge off. but overall, a fantastic beer that completely lives up to the hype."
"I'll leave the drinking notes to others. Is it good - yes! I do think other brewers are starting to catch this or surpass this. That said, enjoy it if you can! Don't sell the house for it, but definitely one that must be tried and appreciated. I would gladly have another sir!"
"If you see any Russian River product, especially this one, you'd be a fool not to pick it up, because if you don't, you'll be missing out on one of the best beers from the Best Brewery in the World (in my opinion)."
"Drinkability: Awesome. This is a spectacular beer. The hoppiness isn't going to knock you down and the soft finish will keep you coming back for more. THe 8% alcohol by volume is hardly noticable. Top notch beer."
"A great beer. More mild than pliny the younger with less of an in your face smell. The taste is more balanced with a great hoppiness with some caramel malting to balance without getting in the way of my hop fix. The mouth feel is crisp yet malty and hop oily. I could drink this all day and the 8 percent alcohol doesn't bother me at all. Go try this beer. NOW!"
"Wonderful."
"Poured this sample into a wide-mouthed goblet. Medium copper color with a thin white cap that lasts until the end. Fast-rising tiny bead rising from bottom of glass. First smell reminded me of HopSlam, honestly. Has a sweet citrusy/grapefruity smell that I absolutely love in a big IPA. Could sit and sniff this for quite a while. First taste was unbelieveably smooth and sweet with a bitterness bash coming in mid-palate and lasting quite a long time. As it warms, the malty tones makes themselves known and it turns into a piney bitterness. I adjusted to the bitterness rather quickly and found this to be fairly well-balanced. Definitely full-bodied and sticky. Resiny feel left behind and there is little carbonation felt on tongue. Awesome and sneaky drinkability; deceptively smooth. I have had stuff claiming 100+ IBUs and can't remember one that actually seemed as bitter as this one. Excellent experience."
"D- another great 2IPA, if you could get all this flavor in less ABV%, that would be session heaven. I'm starting to notice that you really have to look at each 2IPA to tell them apart anymore, its the little things that count. anyhow, try this brew"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle from the PtE bottling project. I've had this beer on tap and from growlers many times and I must say this sample from the bottle is virtually indistinguishable from the tapped version. Much, much better than what you would get from a growler. Appears a clear golden amber color with two fingers of off white head. A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of fresh, piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, apricot and a pleasant grassy note. Tastes of piney, citrusy, and lemony hops. Finish is peppery, bitter, and dry. Medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Dangerously drinkable. Believe the hype."
"Very creamy and smooth as well. Great drinkability you get so caught up in the taste you don't realize how fast this beer is going down."
"Hops, hops, and more hops. Smell is moderate but indicative of what's to come. Loads of cascade and a variety of other hops come together to give a fresh piney, grapefruit goodness. Nothing spectacular about the smell alone, although this could be due to the lack of head. Taste is bitter up front but well rounded, piney with delicate fruits and rich complexity of mild malts, all with a lingering early-hop pine backbone. Mouthfeel is full and bubbly. Drinkability, like all RR beers, is superb."
"Highly, highly recommended."
"Drinkability with this beer is close to perfect. The hop strength is amazing but I don't get tired of this after a glass. The low ABV for the style is a very welcome addition for extended enjoyment."
"This was served with a light, bone-white head with little retention. It was sunshine-yellow in color with a light cloudiness. The nose was like sniffing a pine tree and singed some of my nose hairs. The pine taste was evident on the mouth with an interesting underlying sweetness, perhaps biscuity. The mouthfeel was unexpectedly thin. The finish was dry with a lingering presence of pine. Wow."
"My kind of IPA, balance out the window! Despite that, for the true hophead, very drinkable (even at 8%). Worth the wait and not overhyped at all. This may be my favorite beer of all, at least of IPA types."
"Big thanks to mcallister and pixel for inviting my wife and I over to sample this growler. Bright gold in color, with a thick white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, however there were some great patches of lace clinging to the glass. Great aroma of pine, citrus (namely tangerine), and grass. Solid sweet malt background, followed by a good amount of piney, citrusy hops. A lot of peach and tangerine flavors. Very well balanced. Medium body. Very nicely done."
"Smoothe as hell. Rich and creamy, hops aren't overpowering but spot on. Nice floral bittering ending, very piney mid palate. All about integration here. Malt keeps the hop at bay. Man can't get over the balance. An DIPA that is easily drinkable all day."
"Poured a deep crystal clear amber with a nce foamy head that was slow to fad, leaving a fine lace all the way to the bottom. The smell is deep piney hops with a bit of grapefruit thrown in for good measure. The taste...well lets just say this ain't you daddy's beer!! Knock you down hops, beautiful, strong, pine and citrus that will have you puckering your mouth for a while. Great dry finish. This is a hop heads delight and lived up to the hype I must say, etremely enjoyable and simply astounding!"
"Dark amber pour with sticky lace and a powerful aroma. Hop profile is all over the place- citrus, floral etc. with some sugary malt in the background. Taste is much more subdued than expected- hops play with the tongue and become one with the malt backbone. Excellent finish, as the dryness of the hops play against the thick and slick DIPA body. One of the smoothest out there; cant wait to try the Younger."
"Seemed from the start this was good, but I wouldn't have said all that great. But quickly, and more and more through the tasting, all the little things would add up, and this truly started showing itself for the great IPA it is. At first - considering all the hype - I was skeptical; but by the end I was extremely impressed. Recommended, (duh!)"
"Cheers!"
"D: Probably the best characteristic of the elder is that its only 8%. Though that's a high ABV, it's more manageable than the Younger. I *want* to drink the whole growler in one sitting, but I have to pace myself given that it's unlikely I'll see it again anytime soon. Absolutely lived up to the hype. I think the Younger is a greater treat for hop heads, but this one is plenty good while the Younger is aging."
"Pours a coppery burnt orange and clear with an off white head that slowly recedes. Aroma is big on the citrusy hops, a nice sweet red grapefruit, orange rind, and a nice light cotton candy malt sweetness. Taste is a very nice sweet florida orange, just that right amount of citrusy sweetness balanced by the bitterness of the rind and membrane. Creamy and soft malty body shows a nice spicy pepperiness and just a hint of alcohol. There is a nice lingering mild dryness to the finish. A very well balanced beer, nothing is out of control or over the top, mouthfeel is very nice, soft malts and bitterness blend together very well. Taste is like eating fresh citrus fruit, yum. Thank you Beerbeing for the opportunity."
"In my early years here, a BA mentioned this beer to me as one I had to try. Maybe 4-5 years ago. It's been on the back burner for quite some time and now I've finally got a chance to have at it. And it comes, with many thanks, to a top notch guy...The Long Beach Bum. Thanks a ton for setting me up with this nectar."
"D - Excelent! this did not let me down."
"D: I'm actually a bit underwhelmed with this beer compared to my expectations. The simplicity was unexpected, and I was left wanting a bit more. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer. Great with food, impressive if it's on tap next to the likes of your standard liquor store on the corner beers. But it pales in comparison to the great DIPAs of the world."
"Drinkability: An amazing IPA. I've enjoyed many world class DIPA's lately, and Elder did not disappoint. Again, I think its beauty is in how (somehow) Vince managed to make this simultaneously so packed full of hop amazingness and yet not make the brew entirely overpowering. Fantastic craftsmanship."
"Cheers Josh!"
"Pours a clear amber, huge thick white head, lacing everywhere, great retention, this shit sticks. Smell is huge hops, tons of pine, citrus and floral, some toffee, real balanced and pleasant. Taste is hopped up as well, some toffee notes, pine, citrus and floral, more pine, bit of malt, nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very smooth, insane balanced, could drink this all night. Thanks again Jay!"
"5.5 years later and very good well integrated DIPA fresh bottle from OCBeerSociety extra."
"this was by far my favourite beer at this tasting. if i was stranded on a desert island with only two growlers it would be this one and some masala mama. big super extra thanks to jay for scoring this one and hooking us all up. probably the first time pliny has been to toronto and i suspect it'll be a while before it is again."
"Although this is a fairly high alcohol beer, I order this anytime I see it on draft. (which isn't often enough) An excellent beer. One of my all time favs."
"re-rated May-14 after visit to brewery. this really is the quintessential American DIPA"
"D - Overall, the best tasting and most well-balanced double IPA I've had. The high ABV doesn't come through in the taste as much as you would expect. Definitely lived up to the hype."
"On a bragging note, I was lucky enough to be at RR Brewing when they had 5 IPAs on Tap: Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Summit IPA, Plind Pig, and RR IPA. I had 'em all baby!"
"On tap at Bierria Paradiso in D.C. Bright orange color with a touch of copper. Foamy cream white head. Tons of sheets of lacing. Smell is very citrusy with some floral freshness. Lots of sweeter fruity malt flavors as well. Taste is similar. Orange dominated but there's more of a resin piney flavor that what I smelled. Underlying tropical sweetness the whole way through but it's quite bitter. Hops hit their high point about midway through but the finish is a bit weak. Sweetness comes through a bit more at the end. Body is a touch lighter than I might have hoped. This beer really has a nice balance of malts and hops and alcohol for a DIPA. Very drinkable. The mouthfeel and finish could have been a touch better. But overall, very enjoyable."
"A very fine example of a Double IPA. A must try for any hophead."
"D - Excellent. I would never have guessed the strength of this one. It is a beer that lives up to the hype. It was an awesome experience for sure. I had this at the Pizzeria Paradiso shorty before they kicked the keg. Lucky me!"
"Edit: Had a fresh bottle (2 actually) today (3-17-11) and it seemed off. The flavors weren't as juicy and there was a dry grassiness to it, more so than the others I've had. Really hindered the mouthfeel and enjoyment...although still good. A bit overhyped"
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a slightly orange tint and a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of sticky lace behind as it slowly recedes. Nose is quite aromatic with strong scents of piney hops along with some fresh grapefruit. Taste is big-time hoppiness, but there is a fair amount of sweet malt to help keeps things somewhat in balance. Really deliciousthis ones a winner."
"All Hail Pliny!"
"Poured from growler into Sierra Nevada """tulip""" glass, there is a slight haze, but the color is just what I want to see from a pale ale. Lovely lacy head that sticks. Smell is awesome, citrus/grapefruit, piney, resiny, slightly floral hops. I didn't speak for a few minutes after first taste. Wow. This beer is so well put together. All the flavors from the scent are here, the hop flavor is so juicy! The yeast works with the malt really well here too, the interplay is so beautiful. Only question is whether this is a 4.5 or a 5 in taste, tough call. Mouthfeel is good, slightly dry. Drinkability is exceptional for a beer this strong in taste and alcohol. My notes from last night say """I could drink nothing but this all week.""""
"This is a stellar beer."
"Drinkability: I would try to session this and fail, and wake up the next day and try again. This just became one of my favorite beers."
"Tried/enjoyed this over the course of 10 days in the Sierra and San Diego about 5 times.sheesh, I wish this was on tap in just about every craft beer stop in my neck of the woods! Anyway what can be added to the other reviews? Golden,glowing,shimmering olive oil amber. Light tan head, intense fine lacing. Grainy hop sniff. This is a beautifully crafted beer, hops are front, middle and rear. Grapefruit, pine tar, oily. I love this heady, artisinal creation! C'mon RR start shipping kegs of this to the east coast on a regular basis....Please?"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. This beer is pure heaven. I've been fortunate enough to have this beer on many occasions. I don't care where I'm at, or what's on tap, if they have Pliny on tapI'm drinking it and drinking it first. This is the only beer to date that I've felt worthy of giving all 5's to and waited a while to finally review it. Beatification was a close second. Russian River has quickly became my favorite brewery due to consistently amazing beers. I look forward to many more years of drinking Vinnie's trend setting beers."
"Despite the low head the carb is good and adds nice tingle to the hops. Full bodied by not syrupy. Drinkable? Hell yes, more please!"
"Tasty for sure. This kinda tastes how I wish Dreadnaught tasted."
"Hazed gold with a faint orange hue. My pint arrived with a short cap of long lasting, cream coloured foam. Lacing was solid and rings formed at each sip. Very nice. The aroma was intense with sweet fruity, floral hops - very distinctive, kind of like fruity candies. Pine and grapefruit were also prominent and there was a light chalkiness or powderiness as well. Wow, this is quite a balanced monster. The bitterness is strong, but is kept in check by the malt until the finish where it lingers along with pine and grapefruit. It starts on the sweet side with a toasty maltiness. The hops (pine and grapefruit) really kick in after this, but stay balanced. There's also a pleasant fruit and floral quality to the hops that show up towards the end. Medium/full bodied, nearly chewy, with a luxurious, creamy texture. Alcohol wasn't apparent. It's scary how easy this goes down. Definitely a world class beer, highly recommended."
"P the E is definitely one archetype of West Coast IPAs. Sometimes I prefer the thick, sweet Hop-Rod style, but this beer is an extraordinarily drinkable example of the drier, crispy/hop-domination style, and that's good too. It's hard to describe how drinkable Pliny is. I mean, 8 percent?! I never would have guessed. No wonder I'm always so stumbly walking out of Toronado."
"Very drinkable due to its complexity that keeps you going back for another sip."
"Fullness of the oily hops and yeast just leaves you wanting more. My taste buds are happy. This is great ale. I had something similar in Eureka,CA. at a brewery in town there, (Eureka Brewing Co.?) years ago that I think went out of business. Shame, it was a fun place. Golden triangle indeed."
"Light golden color with a thick white head that left almost solid lacing down 3/4 of the glass. Very hoppy nose. Pine and grass come out strong. Flavor is heavy on the piney hops, also, and quite bitter. One heck of a hop bomb. Slick mouthfeel from all the hop oil. Bitter finish lasts and lasts. I had to drink two glasses of water just to taste my next beer. I wish I could get this more often."
"Mouthfeel is surpisingly light for such a big beer. Drinkability is ok, a little too bitter for me."
"And might I add, another perfect candidate for a hand-pump!!!"
"This really is one of the most elite IPAs out there. The body is on the full side with great appeal. A taste have for the hop lovers for sure."
"This beer would probably not be the best choice for a session beer. It is very aggressive. Also, it is a little high in alcohol, making drinking too many a bad choice."
"Wow, I love this brew!!! I first had it down Pizza Port way, in Carlsbad. Hard to find on tap in socal. Well blessed me...thay had it had Brewfest in Portland!!! Good nose, lightly sweet with a hint of the hops to come. The hint of pine and citrus meeting malt graces my mouth, good feel, not too heavy or full, and the swallow...now I get that slightly dry, crisp finish with...hmmm a bit of pine again. Wow, I love this beer!!!"
"This is how a double IPA should be. I've gotta find a way to get it in Seattle."
"Monstrous hop bomb. Like sucking on a hop-laden pine cone. More citrus comes to the front. Some maltiness comes through, but not nearly enough to take away from the hops. Very dry. Nicely balanced and extremely drinkable for a beer so hoppy. Surprisingly, 8% doesn't really come through on the tongue. Makes this even more drinkable."
"What a treat! I was surprised to see this on tap. I've read about this, and was wondering if i would get a chance to taste this. Wonderful Hollinghead Deli in Orange apparaenlty has this or one of his nephews on tap regularly. Nice amber color, with good creamy head. Very hoppy/grassy, slightly flower aroma. Very sticky lace all the way down. Very balanced malt and hop flavor, but that could be the hop-head talking. Would love to have a 90 minute, ruination, Buzz Saw, and Pliny the elder taste off. But would need to take a nap afterwards. Love this beer"
"This DIPA seems a likely legendary and a lucky find for me."
"I wish they would bottle this stuff. Great, great beer."
"On tap at Toronado. Bright amber orange with a full white head. Head lasts well for an IPA. Body is medium to full with intermittent carbonation attacks. Aroma comes on complexly featuring an appealing amount of pineapple on top of a subtle pine/juniper base. By far, however, the pine is overshadowed by citrus juice, peaches, and grapefruit. The aroma could be described as candy like if it didnt trigger receptors in your brain that say: Warning Hop Blast Acomin! Feels tangy and acidic with a citrus medley blast of lime, lemon, grapefruit, and nectarine. Perfectly balanced (for the style) with a sweet malt base and only residual pine oils in the flavor. More delicate then expected. My tongue is not destroyed after two glasses. I guess that makes this one a drinker."
"Seek this out. It's worldclass. Thanks, George!"
"My hat's off too Russian River...2X well done, Cheers!!!"
"On tap from a pint glass at Toronado, the Elder looks very elegant with a thick white blanket of head covering a glowing golden orange. Each drink leaves another level of lace clinging to the glass. The smell is pine, citrus, and loads of malty goodness. The taste is even better, walking a perfect tightrope between the strong malt flavor and the hop bitterness. With every drink, new flavors come out. At times it seems to have almost a candy sweentess, with some drinks caramel, and with other sips a doughy quality. It's almost chewy, with a tremendous mouthfeel. The drinkability is amazing. With an incredible selection at Toronado, I went back for a second Elder. This is one of the best beers I've ever tasted."
"My Pliny the Elder poured a vibrant gold color into a Duvel tulip glass and I was suprised that when I completed the pour a great white head arose from the bottom of the glass and gave me a nice big piney, hoppy aroma that was so refreshing. The taste does not disappoint either. For a hop lover this beer is great. The bitter hoppy taste and citrus on the tongue and all through my mouth make this a very drinkable beer but at around 8% it is dangerous to put down and not have another. You can definitely taste the hops in your mouth long after the beer has gone down your throat as if you are sucking on a pine cone. I will be sure to savor this one over a night or 2 until the growler is all empty."
"Pliny the Elder is an equally hoppy, slightly more bitter, lower in alcohol, lighter bodied (but still full-bodied) version of Pliny the Younger. Both are exceptional beers and both deserve every accolade that is bestowed upon them. More hop alchemy from the ridiculously talented Mr. Cilurzo. Long may he brew!"
"I love this beer, I feel that it does everying that I want it to, and then does it to perfection."
"Notes: When my friend to me to the Father's Office for dinner, I never imagined I would see Pliny on tap. Just getting the chance to try this brew was worth any price, and it was priced quite fairly ($7/pint). It is nipping at the heels of my favorites (DFH 90 Min & Dreadnaught), but not there yet."
"my favorite hop bomb to date"
"Update - I first reviewed this in 2006 and had a chance to sample it from the bottle again in 2010. It is raw this year and has a monstrous pine aroma. The flavor will cause the uninitiated to dial 911. As massive as the hops are in this beer, to me, still as I said four years ago, it is the malt backbone that separates this man from the boys. I've seen a few examples like this of hop overkill, but this is the only really big monster hop beer that tries to be a true, complete, well-rounded beer if you know what I mean. Most won't even notice the malt base as this one is so hoppy, but it's that almost unnoticeable malt backbone that completes the package."
"Honestly, if I had to drink two DIPAs the rest of my life, it would be this and Alpine's, hands down."
"While there are some slight malt tones in this baby it is like drinking pure hops, but somehow feels balanced and not overwhelming. With a nice 8% ABV it doesn't overwhelm. Just a pure stunner, travel to get your hands on this beer, its that good."
"Draught tonight at Toronado in San Francisco, California. Light orange in color with attractive lacing, and I rarely say that anymore. Extremely hoppy with hints of dry, burned pine, juicy grapefruit along with big tangerine and orange flavors. I don't really like the strong dry hopped character. It seems like it needs more middle hops or something. The malt character could be more substancial as well."
"overall a crazy beer. good, not earth-shattering though."
"D: Keep going back for more. Almost cried when I finished the bomber. Couldnt have more than a few in a night, but I also was amazed at how fast I tore through the 22 oz"
"Until recently I was never able to enjoy hops the way the typical BA hop-head does, but I have finally moved over to the.... light side. But even when I did not love the hops, I could easily see the brilliance that is Pliny the Elder. It pours out to a beautiful golden color with a normal amount of head and intricate lacing, and the smell is that of pure, unadulterated hops (among other herbal aromas I've heard mentioned). The taste, however, is what has always blown me away: intense hop flavor that rivals few and makes Russian River's super-hot pepperonis seem bland and tasteless. This is a beer to be enjoyed by smell, taste, sight, and really any sense that you can muster up."
"Drinkability is great very enjoyable, anyone have a clone of the Pliny's they would like to share? Stuff is so good no alcohol noted you could drink this all day, every day."
"Body is bigger than medium, not quite large, with a creamy mouthfeel, tight carbonation, and a sticky, resinous texture that just begs for another sip of this sweet, sweet nectar."
"As delicious and hoppy as my original review. It is great to see that they bottle this wonderful elixir now. The hops have faded a touch in this bottle so I would say drink it as soon as you get it and as fresh as possible for sure! Thanks to photomike for sending me this bottle. Simply amazing stuff."
"Bottle hand filled off a 5 gallon keg using counter pressure filler into a 22 oz bottle; this is a 11 oz sample. Highest care was taken in getting this brew out for folks to try. It pours a light golden color with a finger of white head that falls to a healthy coat over top that form a solid barrier to the liquid. Clarity is very good, but not pristine. Good looker. Nose is great. Candied grapefruit and oranges in a very sweet caramel glaze. Balance is fantastic. The hops are juicy and fruity and the malts are sweet, but not cloying. Nice. Flavor is nice as well. Very sweet in both hop and malt. Its right on with the aroma having candied orange and grapefruit and even sweet apircot flavors. After swallowing, there is a light peppery spice from the hop that moves right into a moderate bitterness that hangs on, letting me know its there, but its very smooth and not biting. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. The carbonation breaks up the fullness, making it more than highly drinkable. This beer is everthing I hoped it would be. No hint of the alcohol at all, very clean bitter on the finish, very juicy flavors, very nice mouthfeel. This beer is a keeper. If this is any indication to what it is like to have this one off tap, then fly me to California because I'm sold on Russian River. Fantastic."
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that falls slowly and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is WOW. Hops then some hops. But there is an underlying sweetness that has a caramel character. Smells very nice. The flavor is surprisingly balanced. Lots of hop flavors, but also there is plenty of malt sweetness and caramel flavor. I'm the opposite of a hop head, but this beer tastes great to me. The flavor hops aren't over the top like most I2PA's. It just blends and adds the bitterness at the end. Very nice beer. The body is moderate and the drinkability is great for 8%."
"The only possible problem with this beer is that every beer you drink for a week after will just not come close to it."
"Sampled from the unofficially bottled from a 5 gallon keg into 22 oz. bombers by BA RedwoodGeorge, the beer came out well carbonated, and free of oxidation, thanks to the counterpressure filler used during bottling. The body was clear pale in color, and the head was frothy and stable. The aroma was a milder version of the grapefruit and pine hops than the nephew beer. The hop flavor leaped off the taste buds with a citric and salty vigor. The malt was primarily a supporting player here, with a clean unobtrusive semi-sweet character. This was more of a spicy rather than bitter hop profile, which suited me just fine. The mouthfeel was medium and slick, with hops fading off rather than sticking around as a teeth coating film. This beer was very easy to drink, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV. Different than Pliny the Younger in several ways (not quite as sweet, nor as aromatic), but I can still see the family resemblance."
"Had this on-tap at Pizza Port San Clemente. Appearance was the usual golden IPA color, with a touch of brown. 1/2""" head or so. Smell was of some refreshing, citrusy hops. Not much else, but this is an IPA - great smell for the style. Taste was amazing. One of the most perfectly balanced Double IPAs in my opinion. Nice touch of hops in the beginning, followed immediately by a lighter-bodied maltiness. This malt is not heavy at all (perfect for an IPA), but gives a nice balance and contrast to the hops that are to come. The malt here seems to be used more as a way to anchor the hops. The hops then take over at the end, and are very refreshing and citrusy. They linger a nice long while, perfect with the pizza being consumed at the same time. All in all, a perfect balance of hops and malt - something not found in many double IPAs. Mouthfeel is exceptional on this, exactly how I think IPAs should be - lighter-bodied (medium-bodied for an IPA) but full of flavor. Drinkability is perfect on this. So much flavor, and so tasty, but not too filling. I could drink way too many of these. Maybe it's good they don't bottle this one..."
"It is about time that I review Pliny the Elder, having had it on tap a number of times in the last six months. It is one of my favorite beers. It pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a nice head with plenty of head retention. The overwhelming aroma is of hops as is the taste. There is also a balancing sweet smoothness that really comes out at the end. This is a full-bodied brew with a satisfyingly thick mouthfeel. It is a beer that I seek out, and I'm always left wanting more."
"A classic example of the American over-hopped style IPA or double IPA. Still an enjoyable brew but indulgent to say the least."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and quite drinkable. It is amazing to me how hoppy this is; yet it seems so balanced, worth all the hype."
" A forest I could drink all day long."
"SoCal can relax. We aren't threatened by the wine country yet!"
"I was able to try this recently when a friend from work was able to acquire a 1/2 barrel for his homebrewing Christmas party. He was able to bottle a sample for me to try. I was weary as I couldn't imagine it could live up to the hype. I was wrong. It poured light amber/gold with a pleasant white head. Aroma of pine and citrus. The body of the beer was hard to find since it was hiding behind the hops. All I could think of as I drank it was how much I like hops. Crisp clean finish. Drinkability was limited by the volume I had. If could see drinking more than one of these in a sitting but not much more than 3."
"It is a slow drinking beer. It complimented the spicy garlic fries I was having and it lasted a while. Because of the ABV, you couldn't pound these for that reason alone but the drinkability is good because it is one I definitely want again for another impression."
"Hops are front and center here, showing off their oily, sticky herbal goodness from start to finish. The middle contains a chewy malt profile, bready and dry, ending with a touch of alcohol and plenty of hop bitterness. Wow. This is all I expected. One I'd drink lots and lots of. Certainly worth the time, effort, money, drive, or whatever is needed to acquire some of this delightful nectar. Big, big ups to RedwoodGeorge for hookin' this east coast lad up with this left coast deliciousness."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"I was lucky enough to be at GLP just in time for the tapping of this keg. Now, it was on the heels of the Yeti I'd just had, so I needed some water and spicy rare tuna to cleanse the palate a bit, but once I got my teeth into this one, I was one very happy camper. It's not at all shy about its in-your-face hoppiness, and the way it's crafted, there's no reason for it to be. No, there's no balance here, but there's not supposed to be, and that is the main thrust of the impressive brewmanship. It lists so heavily hopwards, but never totally leaves its malt lineage behind. The ABV is beefy, in proportion with the load of hops, so it is a sipper, but the occasional gulp is inevitable, just to have a mouthful to feel how alive it is. And it's now time to wrap this up, because I'm off to get me a growler of this nectar..."
"First sip reveals an average body with fine and tingly carbonation. Flavor is slightly fruity sweet up front and then the hops take over with sappy resin pine dominant. The flavor finishes sticky and thick with lip smacking bite. This is a must have for any hop heads out there. QUite a great beer that I am glad to have tried!"
"Clear light gold pour, the head is white and big. Astonishing woody flavours cover the leafy and herbal hops that feel like a perfume. The malt base is potently biscuity and grainy/bready. The aromatic hops seem underwhelmed by the bitterness ones that hide one of the biggest punch Ive yet to feel, but fool is the one who thinks the malt is not there to support it as this has plenty of toasted and cereal maltiness, medium bodied, yet with airy and foamy carbonation."
"This beer has a soft orange-color to it with an off-white head that has incredible lasting ability. The lacing left behind on my pint glass looked like a painting, it was that intricate. The smell is mostly of citrus, hops, and dried fruit. The taste is typical for the style...a complex merging of malt, hop induced bitterness, followed by a dry, almost astringent taste. Overall, I think this is an excellent ale with distinct character and texture. I had to deduct points for the aftertaste because the bready texture didn't sit well in the back of my throat. The aftertaste does not really dissipates, it simply changes over time."
"I think this was extremely good, and I wish I could find it in Ohio."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel- nice. Perfect. Still fizzy but not what I would call light. For all that flavor, not thick either. Drinkability- well, I already drank half the growler, but... it is 8%... so, a score of 4 for that. Tastes like I could drink it all day, but with the alcohol content (no alcohol taste) it could well get one in trouble. Overall it's a highly enjoyable brew, and I must thank Mr. LBB again for the growler. If you can get yer hands on this one, do so!!"
"For hop lovers, this is one you should not miss."
"Another offering I enjoyed at Russian River Brewing Co in Santa Rosa. This beer pored a bright copper to amber with a thick white head, that left a beautiful lace on the side of the glass. Overwhelming citrus grapefruit aroma. It has grapefruit rind, a little orange, grass and a bit of pine. Just a hint of caramel in the aroma on the finish. The flavor has loads of hop. Grapefruit, orange, pine, grass, hay, and every other descriptive term you can have for hops. There is a bit of caramel sweetness on the finish. The bitterness is ever-present, but not dominating. It has a nice, rich mouth feel, and is surprisingly drinkable. Awesome beer."
"Extreme hoppiness. And I mean it. But a damn-good hoppiness it is, combined with an oily, creamy mouthfeel that sticks to your palate and sucks the water out of your head. Lightly acidic with potent juniper berry and fruity grapefruit and lemon flavors, even after taking the plane from California. To heck with the ABV, I could still drink a few of these. A standout beer for sure."
"I tried this double IPA on tap at the Russian River Brewery, and it was a focal point of my trip out to California. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The serving was in a standard pint glass, which sort of surprised me; I was expecting a 10 oz. pour. The nose of the beer was incredibly floral, which gave a good indication of the hefty hop presence. [Being a hop-head I was very happy with the level of hops included in this beer] The mouthfeel was somewhat standard compared to other double IPAs I've tried, but the taste lasted just long enough to entice another sip. I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and would recommend it highly to anyone who can find it. My only problem with this beer is that it is very difficult to get on the west coast. Russian River if you are reading this, please bottle the Pliny series, and distribute to the East Coast."
"Drinkability: Solid IPA one a nice, hot San Diego afternoon. I won't be running back for another one of these unless I need a hop fix, but it's definately a good beer for the hop heads out there."
"This is a highly drinkable brew that will please any hop lover. What makes this beer stand apart from the crowd is just how well balanced the tastes are and just how smooth the beer goes down. A true craft beer from a real craftsman."
"Straw to amber colour with much less of head than the same brewer's IPA. It has a much more potent citrus smell (think grapefruit mixed with sour apple candy). Very sweet as the candy flavour dominates....this one should definitely be kept away from small children! Rather flatter than the IPA, but disturbingly drinkable given its strength."
"Also wanted to mention, I had a nice chat with vinnie when I was there a well. He does some good stuff there and is looking to expand before too much longer."
"Notes: I'm so glad I can find this on a regular basis even though I can only find it on tap thats fine with me. Truly one of, if not the greatest, double IPA."
"This beer is absolutely delicious. A wonderful example of the style. One of the best draft beers I have ever had."
"I have savored this impeccable brew many times in the past, most notably being at the Korbel RR tap room, it's birthplace, and at the new RRBC site in Santa Rosa CA, with Vinnie Cilurzo himself serving it up. But most recently it was IMO 'best-of-show' at the 10th Annual Mammoth Bluespalooza at Mammoth Mountain CA. Up against 49 other outstanding, worthy competitors, Pliny once again showed how it has raised the bar for all other DIPA's to try and reach. Rich gold in color, clear yet translucent, almost looks like it would pour like honey. The rich smell of pine sap and grapefruit permeates from the glass immediately. Its almost like a wicked citrus fruit juice, except its 8.0%ABV is inescapable. It was the only tap that the other pourers were routinely sneaking off too to sneak a taste. A truly magical representation of the DIPA breed with a drinkability unequaled by any other. Now, dont get me started on Pliny the Younger . . ."

"Poured a hazy golden color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. arma of floral hops, sweet tangerine, and caramel malts. Taste of sweet, chewy caramel, toffee malts, grapefruit, with a very bitter hop finish, and alcohol as well."
"Easily the best beer of my entire trip. Pours a bright golden orange body with a thick white head. Wonderful aroma of pine, citrus, fruit and malt. Very earthy and leafy. I was expecting to be blown away by the hop profile, but I was pleasantly surprised at the balance that this beer has. Great malt backbone, but the hops really define this beer. This is truly bliss in a glass. I will be back for more."
"Pale with a foamy head and strong columns of carbonation. Oooh that smell...vinous hoppiness. Grapefruit, pine needles, and chewy hops dominate the mouth, then this hit of malt sweetness peeks out in the middle before a long oily finish. Medium body and decent mouthfeel. This is one highly drinkable IPA. Recommended. VA BAs, get to Capital Ale House and enjoy!"
"Had this beer at ABF, one of the most amazing beers ever had. Very smooth and full of flavor. They really out did themselves this time. Usually a heavier beer man but this beer was undescribable. Waiting for Piny the Younger. Hopefully soon to be available in Massachusetts."
"Had on tap at Mugs in Brooklyn, $5/pint...unbeatable! And it was tapped only an hour or two before we got to the bar. On to the beer: Burnished gold in color, I thought the aroma was very nice, it came across as nicely blended and balanced. Tastewise, I appreciated the fact that the alcohol kept itself hidden. I also enjoyed the grassy hop taste of this one. Very smooth and easy to drink, I kept the drinkability at 4 due to the alcohol."
"Just enough body to support the massive hopping, but also dry enough for the balance to shift to make for a decidedly West Coast DIPA. Definitive. Epitomizes the West Coast. This beer is holy."
"Light amber appearance, decent head of small bubbles. Laces in thick strings. Aroma is majorly piquant in lots of ways. HUGE hops, lupulin oozes out and sneaks into every corner of your mouth -- first citrusy and then ranging to pine and then back to a slightly sweeter pink grapefruit -- but always in your face. This is a partly comparative review, a face-off between this and Avery Maharaja IPA (as I was pouring it at the fest, I sucked down the last six ounces of Maharaja from a nearing empty bomber, well, about ten or eleven times), but frankly for me, its not a contest -- the Raj may win in body and sticky malt but the intense hops of Pliny just gush out in a way rarely seen in beerdom. One of the true best in class. Sometimes you get fairly detailed in a review, but just saying Pliny the Elder is INSANE says a lot. Hot damn, what's Pliny the YOUNGER like?"
"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap in PA. My pint had a smooth orangeyellow color with a neat white head of tiny foam displaying excellent retention. The smell is of the hops, by the hops, and for the hops. It's an amazingly pungent green smell, absolutely piney, with strong bursts of grapefruit and lemon jucie made into a smoothie with spruce boughs. Wow. Hophead's dream. The taste is wonderful as well. The sharp hoppiness recedes on first sip and a light to medium malt base gives a slight sweetness before a rush of bitterness pours out in the finish. Sharp, nearly painful hop-bite in the aftertaste, but the blend is so floral, so raw and green and so sassy that it begs for more. I really enjoyed this beer. Drinkability might finally die when saplings start to grow from your palette, but I can't knock it too much on that fact. The most refined DIPA I've had, but if you strip something down this much and leave only the best, where else can you go from there? I'm sold on Rusian River and can't wait to try more from them."
"One of the best double IPA's I've had!"
"Pliny the Elder pours amber to orange with a white head. This beer presents a bouquet filled with all sorts of subtle, elegant and savory fragrances... just kidding. It's all hops! The mouthfeel is thick and oily. New rule: All Double IPA's must be at least as hoppy and bitter as this stuff. Somewhere underneath the intense spicy citrus and pine flavors are sweet malts. Very drinkable for such a big beer. Hats off to Russian River. Now how about a Double Pliny the Elder?"
"Finger licking good...and then some!"
"drinkablility.: went down like great. could drink this all nite. but can't since it's not around in sacramento. I'm gonna send an email to russian river about that. alright."
"Excellent for one who can handle the hops."
"I return from an extended absence older, mayber wiser, but definitely enriched by my crossing of this beer path. A sophisticated IPA- very strong, floral, with a bitter edge but not enough to put you over. Color a gold sunset amber- wonderful head with an aroma of wild windswept flowered prairies. I wax a bit here but this beer will wake your a-- up! I had no expectations and the pints opened my eyes to a beer that can hold a candle to my San Diego stonewarts- not as balanced as my masalade mama- but still very enjoyable,especially paired with the panfried trout supper. Aroma faintly of spring hynacith- but has the staying power of strong praire grass. Flavor grabs you in a hops vice, more a hops shroud. Enough of a balance to warm and season the palate through and beyond the initial sips. A great beer that deserves its elder designation. Try to capture some if you can and savor-Ok"
"Dark golden with a nice 1/4""" head of pure white foam. Aromas are intense. Floral, citrus, spice, and more. HOPS! and some biscuity malts and some weed-like aromas as well. The taste is hoppy and bitter with a very deep flavor complexity within the confines of the citrus, flower, and other hop induced flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is up there. A killer DIPA. I like this brewery very much."
"Mouthfeel: A slightly watery medium body, but in a good way. Hop juice and high abv must be less dense that malty goodness."
"Not quite as over the top as I was expecting, but this one did not dissapoint. The beer was a golden color with a great head that was very thick and fluffy. The smell was very floral and full of citrus. The taste was extremly balanced and went down very smoothe. Flavors of sweet malt and spicey hops mixed perfectly to create a true joy to drink. One of the best DIPA's I've had."
"Oh damn, this was good. Had on draft at the Toronado in SF during Big Beer Month. A creamy head topped this golden beer. Aroma is sweet, and almost fruity. This is a hop monster, but totally drinkable and well balanced. I need more Russian River beer!"
"The pure hoppiness of this brew is in direct contrast to many of the out-of-control, over-hopped Left Coast DIPA's in that it is far from overbearing...another victory for Vinnie!"
"I'm in twitchin' anticipation for the day their bottling line runs, then this cult IPA can get even better recognition in the world at large!"
"Get some."
"Great to find this on-cask at Naja's in Redondo Beach."
"Drinkability- Very easily could drink several of these. Didn't notice the abv. Went down like a good IPA. Wonderful if not tied with my favorite DIPA."
"Well Worth seeking out."
"Tap, Toronado, San Fransisco. Full on Americn hops in both aroma and flavour. Massive grapefruit pine, and heavy bittrness. Despite being massively hopped this manages to maintain some balance and softness around the edges. A good beer. Lots of flavour."
"This is my first review in months, but I need to rave about this near perfect double IPA. I tried it for the first time at O'Brien's Pub last winter, but I was able to visit the Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa this summer. Pliny is silk smooth with a great hop finish (25% simcoe hops). It reminded me a bit of Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which is one of my favorites. In leaving the brewery, I purchased a growler and kept it refrigerated for three days before catching a plane back to Southern California. It held up nicely on the plane trip and was a big hit back home (Gone in minutes!)."
"This double IPA poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled but clung and coated the inside of the glass a bit. The smell was fruity, spicy hops with not much malt. The taste was grassy, fruity hops with a good bit of malt to balance. The hoppy flavors lingered very nicely. The mouthfeel was smooth, dry, and very hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish was slightly astringent. This was a very nice and very hoppy double IPA."
"Overall: Hoppiness is a bit too bitter for me, but the maltiness at the end is a great save. A hop heads dream."
"The beer pours somewhat deep amber; the head is white and full in size, the texture semi-creamy with the lace a velum like sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is hop floral, sweet malt underneath, lime like crispness, fresh and a treat for the nose as well as the eyes. Zap the hops slam your taste buds to attention, magnificent is a word I think fits perfectly, stern acidity with a hop spicy dry aftertaste that leaves you puckering and eager for another taste. A beer certainly made for us lovers of hops and another great example of the big California Imperial IPAs."
"Pliny The Elder is one top-notch example of what appears to be a growing style. You definitely need to have your heart (and palate) set for some hops if you order a pint of Pliny."
"I was expecting a much hoppier taste and aroma. Maybe the keg was near the bottom, I don't really know. Despite this """surprise""" I found this a very drinkable beer. At over 9% abv it really went down easy. The beer was a light amber, head was full and left nice lace. At least my sample lacked the hop aroma, taste was very smooth and and did not feel like 100 IBU's. A very interesting beer that garnered a nice rating despite my surprise and questioning of it's being in top form. I tried this again at the pub and I will say wow! A much better sample, hops hops and more palate grabbing hops. Loved it."
"I'll have another."
"Get the picture? this is a hop head's dream. I really enjoyed this one, but it's not for the feint of heart"
