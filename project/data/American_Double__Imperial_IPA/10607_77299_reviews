"Overall: A marvelous DIPA, and one that seems a bit underrated. Exceedingly drinkable for its ABV- dangerously so. This one goes down so easy I could have easily put away a few more without noticing."

"Grapefruit upfront. Oiley, some pine. Alcohol well hidden."

"Topper Lite. Absolutely fantastic double IPA. Get as many as you can."

"Bias review. Has been a favorite of mine in terms of x2 IPA's in recent time. Pungent smell of fresh sticky hops which coordinates with the taste. A solid representation of the style. Would recommend to anyone who likes Pale Ales."

"this is a winner in my book. Poured from a 12oz tall can into shaker pint glass.  Appearance is  pale orange with a 1/4 """ of white foam that dissipates slowly with moderate lacing. Bubbles rising throughout the glass. Nose offers hints of pine and grapefruit hoppiness. Mouthfeel is true to its name. Flavor starts with a slight biscuity malt backbone then Resin takes over and coats the palate with pine flavor mixing into and finishing with grapefruit.Leaves the mouth feeling coated and almost anesthetized but also savoring the taste and wanting more. Hardly notice the alcohol in the taste and at 9.1% abv this ones a shitkicker to be reckoned with for sure. "
""
""
"Clear copper pour, thin clingy white top. Aroma of resin of course, but also fruit and malt. Tangy and powerful taste, with some malt sweetness in the middle, finishing strong and bitter. And bitter lingering."
"Overall: Although it has strong alcohol it was well balanced and was very good."
""
"O – A bitter hop assault accompanied with pleasant aroma and flavor profile.  Impressed that it hides the alcohol level so well.  All-around this really packs a punch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep orange with a touch of rust color and a white head that lasts for a while and deposits some nice chunky lace.  Aromas of citrus, herbal hop, slight pine and a burnt sugar note in the background.  As expected the hops are what this beer is all about.  Flavors of bitter citrus, caramel, grapefruit, and light pine in the finish.  Mouthfeel has enough carbonation up front, smooths out and finishes semi dry.  Alcohol is well hidden and that brings about a pretty dangerous level of drinkability for a brew this big.  This delivers as a DIPA worthy of a throw in to a regular mix.  It's not the best out there but it has a nice blend of classic flavors that make this one an instant winner."

"Kind of bland. Not bad just boring. Will finish the 2 cans I bought but won't buy again."
""
"Another overrated beer by 6 point. There's just not much there as far as smell and taste goes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a two finger off white head into a snifter. Crystal clear amber color with great lacing.  Pine and grapefruit were very pronounced from smell to taste. Considering the 103 IBU'S and 9.1 ABV, I found Sixpoint Resin very drinkable and not to boozie, a good quality DIPA."
"Delicious hoppy creamy taste great."
""
""
"Overall: So promising. Great nose, great flavors, just needs a bit more balance IMO. Strangely, more alcohol/bitterness than Hi-Res. Still, a top notch beer. Very good west coast style DIPA. 4/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great for an IPA.  I'm really into the more bitter IPA's w the citrus taste and delicious bitter after taste to take away from having to take a sip every 5 seconds.  If you enjoy imperials definitely give Resin a try.  First try from Six Point but mos def On Point!  Enjoy!"
"A full body. A little oily taste. Great!"
""
""
""
""
"O- A friend picked this up for me and according to the best by date it is fresh but this must have been stored improperly or something because I'm not tasting big sticky pine notes like many other reviewers are getting. A bit disappointed with this one. It has a sweetness I don't really care for and being called 'RESIN' I was expecting lots of sticky pine but didn't really get that."
""
""
""
"Sticky, dank, hoppy, malty and somehow not sweet. I love this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well balanced and enjoyable beer."
""
""
"I love this IPA, strong piney flavor, great after taste. Smoothe with a great kick, nice carbination. One of the best out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very balanced beer with an powerful hop that resonates for a while."
""
"Another excellent IPA that completely belies its IBU of 100. It tastes more like 50! So well balanced and a fabulous kick at 9.1 ABV."
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Good, clean Imperial IPA.  Lighter than, and goes down easier than Hi-Res."
""
""
""
"Purchased at Total Wine, Tampa, 1/2015. Translucent amber color with white head. Smells of pine, hops, resin, grapefruit, and a hint of candied strawberry/Now-and-Later taffy. Taste parallels much the same with robust piney hops and that sweet candy aftertaste that is almost reminiscent of bubble gum. A very rich and thick IPA that coats the mouth and throat with caramel malts and candied sweetness. I liken this beer very much to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra, but a little thicker, stickier, and danker. Simply a world-class DIPA. 4.39/5"
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a great DIPA, very good hop flavor profile. Also it's really a testament to IBUs being a subjective thing... sure its 100 IBUs but the malt is so sweet that it is no where near overly bitter and ends up being very well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer. Very bitter but well balanced."
""
""
"Not bad.  There is a barely noticeable metallic taste.  Good look, smell, taste, and feel.  Solid, but not inspiring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing beer. First Sixpoint and will be trying the rest. The malt balances well with the massive hops. Smooth taste for a high ABV"
""
""
""
""
""
"Like the balance of malt and hops. Hop burn lingers very slightly at the back of the tongue. Great beer, glad I got a sixer."
""
""
""
"O: Resin is a great beer with excellent hop notes and good balance for a double IPA. It is very crisp and refreshing and surprisingly only has a moderate amount of bitterness. I will be drinking this again without a doubt."
"Great beer.  Best from Six Points."
""
"This is a top-notch IIPA"
""
""
""
""
"It is a great deal at $11 a six pack. It has the requisite piney resin tang and nice carbonation but no hint of the massive 9.1 abv."
""
""
""
"Just a fantastic IPA. Needs no improvement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a huge hophead, but this definitely ranks in my top 5 IPAs."
""
"Resin is awesome. One of my favorite DIPA's.  Big hoppy, give it a try. I think you'll agree."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Far too intense. A palate wrecker for sure. Much prefer Bengali."
""
"God damn is this a tasty beer.  Reminds me of a west coast dbl IPA while still maintaining Sixpoint's distinguishable style and class.  A few of these went down real nice on a freezing cold night while I dreamed of cornucopias filled with fresh citrus fruits and the sun shining on my face."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz can poured into pint glass. Clear golden color; thick head settled slowly, substantial lacing; prominent citrus scent (if you like grapefruit hop flavor, you know you'll like this beer as soon as you get a whiff); crisp but there's some substance to the feel; grapefruit flavor profile, not too bitter with a hint of something sweet at the end. Overall: really good. Sixpoint says """it stings""" but while this is very hoppy, it's got more nuance than just a hop bomb. (9.25)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very boozy and, I'll keep it in mind, next time I plan on getting arrested. Seriously though, behind all of it is some underlying notes of peach skin and delicious red apples. This might not be for everyone given the aggressive nature, but there's a lot more to pull than alcohol, grapefruit and malt. This is super fresh, and I dig it. Can youuuuuuuu dig it?"
""
""
""
"I love sixpoint and I am rarely disappointed. This is an intense hops drink that one has to be in the mood for. I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The beer chemist gets an 'A' for this one."
""
""
""
""
"Love this DIPA. Big head, big flavor, well balanced.  This one is up there."
""
""
""
"Great ipa one of my go to IPA's"
"Dank, stinky, blah, blah, blah.  But this IS the real deal. Truly that and more.  Memorable in that this ale evokes resinous hash, sticky green buds or such. Very few beers on the East coast lead to this sensation.  Canning saves the freshness of the hop """stank""".  Wonderful weekend afternoon ale. And a bargain considering the taste & quality. I'd say it tops Enjoyby for freshness without the marketing """noise""". AND makes  me think I need  to paper clip my pipe...."
""
""
""
"O: Solid DIPA. Clean and balanced. Shows off the beauty of the hop without overshadowing the rest of the ingredients. Beautiful brew that packs a punch!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My 400th beer rated on BeerAdvocate. This beer yields a lance of hops that it jams straight through the rough of your mouth and into your brain. But that's about all it has going for it. It could use more malt and a thicker mouthfeel. Still, if all you care about is hop burn, this should be one of your mainstays."
""
"A go to ipa for me"
""
"There are many beers with a similar flavor but this one stands out. The intense hoppiness with the sweet citrus flavor is delightful. Maybe it's the red bull style can that I'm attracted to but I personally enjoy drinking this one straight out of the can. For some reason, maybe it has to do with easy availability, but I have always passed on this. I will never again take a beer for granted."
""
"Not bad. My can is about 7 mo old, but I'm not complaining since I got it as an extra in a trade. I dig this a lil more than High-Res. Some juicy hop notes in the nose, and it was quite delightful. Flavor profile was unimpressive. It does have some resinous, dank qualities.  Lacked complex layers and direction. Quite malty. Would like to try fresh, but gotta rate as is."
""
"Greatest beer ever? I say yes. As a major IPA fan, this is the most perfect one I've found for my taste."
""
""
""
"Great color,  outstanding flavor, lingering after taste"
""
""
"Mmm mmm good"
""
"Clean, crisp, and delicious. At 103 IBUs this guy comes with a kick, but in all the right ways. Beautiful looking beer, it's like a super model of IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dankness for days! The malt backbone sufficiently props this one up to handle all of those hops that they jammed in here! Surprisingly drinkable (can't really call it sessionable) although it drinks like a much lower ABV brew."
""
""
"O:  A great DIPA - like a true WC DIPA.  Shane was right; they've improved dramatically."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious beer that made my mouth happy.  Its hard to believe it has such high IBU and ABV, because I think I could drink several of these.  But I'm sure I'd pay the price if I did..."

"This fucking website keeps logging me out. I just wrote a well thought out paragraph on this super avg beer and lost the whole thing. All said I don't get this one. All malt no hops. Not offensive but not good. Tastes like long trail limbo."
""
""
""
"I love this beer, nice bitter feeling followed by pine and mango with a slight alcohol taste.  Smells delicious with lots of hops up front.  I can't say I've tasted anything else like it.  I got 2 four packs for $7.99 on sale at a store in NJ.  A good score!"

"Edit: So the brewer contacted me within minutes of posting this review. Not a fan of breweries questioning peoples reviews, but they did seem more concerned about the freshness of the can. (BB04MAY15) As I explained in my response, I think it's a personal preference thing. Nothing wrong with this beer, just not my ideal dipa. Steasy66 drank a can from the same 4 (maybe 6?) pack and thought it was stellar ...and that guy is a way bigger hater than me!! :-P"

"All you mofucking hipster dicks fucking praise this shit. But this shit taste shit. It's awful god fucking awful. Giving it a one is generous this stuff taste awful."
"O:  super sugar sweet with the caramel taste overpowering all.  if you love caramel bombs, this might be as good as it gets.  if you hate them, avoid at all costs.  the 9.1% ABV is 100% hidden, and the 103 IBUs comes off as about 20 -- it really is like a caramel soda, ridiculously sweet."
""
""
""
""
"The fruity aromas and intense sweetness at the initial sip take over for a nice hoppy, bitter finish. Some may find the flavor too intense; but with a 9.1% ABV, I think this a very well crafted beer that is definitely worthy of a sampling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- After sporadic revisits (and reviews) of Resin since its initial release back in early 2012, each was good but far from the quality I am tasting right now. The filtering is perfect, the aroma is insane the taste is everything and more that you would experience from a DIPA, carbonation/mouthfeel is perfect and yep...it comes in cans. Whatever Sixpoint has done over the years, Resin (or at least this latest batch to be featured in 6-Packs) is absolutely dialed in and worthy of qualifying as 'World Class.' (5.0)"
""
""
""
""
""
"I would definitely recommend this and get it again.   A top notch ipa."
"I kept hearing about six point and this is my first taste from this brewery. I like it."
""
""
""
""
"This is one damn good balanced IPA. A very smooth beer for 103 IBU's. I would strongly recommend this beer to any IPA beer drinker."

"Pours orange with a white  head. Aroma is citrusy, piney and resinous with a touch of toasted bread. Flavor follows suit. A touch of alcohol does show itself, unfortunately (at least for me). A medium bodied, active mouthfeel. Overall, good stuff."

"Yep, it’s a big beer, but it finishes more cleanly than most of the style . I don’t know if I’d want to session this, but the 12oz can is an awfully nice serving size, and I could see this as a nice nightcap or a way to start a weekend after a long, draining work week."
""
"Glass- Shaker pint"

"O: you want a resinious pine bomb beer this one does it in spade and you can get it anywhere amazing all the way around this assaults your senses with the resiny hops but you enjoy it all the way"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer.  Not a typical IPA.  strong hop aroma and flavor.  It is missing a strong ale flavor and aftertaste for a beer this strong, which is not a criticism.  It makes the beer very refreshing and easy to drink.  Watch out, easy to drink too much.  nice lacey head and creamy mouthfeel.  no excessive sweetness usually associated with this abv"

"Bought a fresh case of this from the distributor 8 days from canning now. Pours clear gold with a white head. Smells piney and a little bitter. Sweet at first with  pine and citrus lingering.  Very easy to drink. will definitely purchase again."
"Very orange in color. White head that dissipates pretty fast. Has a hoppy savory onion aroma. Really bitter flavor. Lots of floral taste. Sharp on the tongue. Ok beer."

"Overall: I'm on the fence about this one, luckily they come in 4s. I like the huge syrupy feel along with the malty character, but I think the strong caramel flavor takes just a bit too much from the rest of the beer. certainly a beer to revisit for me but as of now, not quite breaking to the elite level for me."
"I am re-reviewing this beer because the first one I had had been stored inproperly at room temperature for a very long time. I originally gave a bad review...WELL, WELL, WELL, what a difference it makes when the beer has been stored properly and is fresh. Wow, is all I can say. The color is a beautiful orangeish color and has a nice head that lingers. I still get the malt sweetness but it is balanced so well with the hops and IBUS that I dare to say that this may be one of the top 10 best beers I have tried. The sweetness hits first, followed by tropical fruits and finishes with a very very pleasant bitterness like citrus peel that is very nice on my palate. I am so excited to try more from Sixpoint that I cant even sit down !!!!!!!!!!!!!. Good job, I will defoinately put this beer on my list to share with friends, Great job!!!!!!!!"

"Overall / Drinkability: A potent beer that really does wear out the palate about halfway through the glass. A definite slow sipper and one per evening on this one. The beer lives up to its name of hop resin oil being the main focus of this beer, but there some malt balance to this beer. I think I could definitely revisit this beer again, maybe with the right food, but by itself it's really quite something."

"Im not sure how I feel about this one. Its heavy and bitter for sure but tough to pick up on much more. It does have the malt balance. I prefer some more citrus in my DIPAs but this is ok for a change up. tough to have more than one in a sitting. Would have again but not going to go looking for this one."
"Very impressive IPA character, enormous without the palate crushing edge. Beautiful."

"I scored a four pack on a visit to Ohio. It pours a beautiful clear gold, with a nice high white head. The smell of pine, cirtus and pineapple hits your nose as soon as the can opens. The flavors carry over from the scents, with a sweetness on the front end and a slight bitterness on the back. For a beer that shows off it's 9.1 ABV and 103 IBU, this one is smooth and very drinakable. I should have nabbed a case!"

"Strong aromas and lots of flavour. A thoroughly enjoying beer, and despite it's bitterness, it's refreshing and goes down easily. Plenty about it to enjoy and lots of complexity to enjoy on every sip. Hoppy and in IPA territory, but with more malty sweetness than usual."

"What a phenomenal beer. Smooth, highly drinkable, with subtle flavors. Nice elements of sweetness on the finish, and gentle hoppiness. Was surprised to see that this is an imperial IPA--it's really not that hoppy, and it doesn't slam you in the face. The ABV is high, but this beer is so tasty and suave that you won't know what hit you. Light, refreshing and flavorful. Great beer."

""

"Food match: It's difficult to advise of an appropriate food for this brew given the severity of the bitterness - I will say spicy cuisine (Indian, Thai, Mexican) would be the best way to approach this hop monstrosity."

""

"Pours a deep, hazy copper with 1-2 fingers of creamy, off-white head that falls to a rich, creamy collar and nice lacing. The nose is a blast of piney, resinous hops, with floral, spicy notes along with some sweet caramel malt, toasted. The taste starts with sweet caramel malt, toasted, bready but transitions to sweet, sticky citrus hops and finishes long and dry with good old American bittering hops. The body is rich and creamy with nice carbonation. This is a really nice, balanced beer; as it warms, the bittering hops really start to take over."

"Sixpoint Resin is one of the best IPAs available here in Houston. Resin consistency not over bearing, hoppy up front, bitter notes at the back w/ an apricot base feel. So well rounded. Better bought fresh, recommend keeping in the pantry unless ready to drink...then fridge or ice cool and drink immediately. """Best before July 13, 2014""" on this can. Still tastes fresh."

"Clear, amber, effervescent with a solid finger of white head. Good lookin'. Pine, lemon, dank goodness... nice nose overall. Piney up front. Strong bitterness (over 100 IBU), but good complement to the strong malt. Getting a bit of juiciness, but the predominant notes are dripping with resin pine forest. Yum. Nice, clean refreshing mouthfeel. Crisp with no funny lingering aftertastes. Solid DIPA."

"Poured from the can into a glass, it has a bright orange color body with a fizzy head. The aroma has a great pine hop aroma to it. The taste starts off with a crisp pine flavor from the hops then a little malt comes to play. The mouthfeel leaves a sticky hop flavor and overall a darn good beer."

""

"O- Not a bad job from Sixpoint. If you like well balanced DIPAs with a heavy hop and malt presence, than this is worth a try. Im sure I'll revisit Resin again, but with so much out there and me liking lighter, more citrusy DIPAs, it might be a little while before we unite. Definitely an overall good ale though."

"O-In a world full of IIPAs, I found this one to be well above-average. I like that it is not a super citrusy me-too clone, but it does not beat you up with too much pine and bitterness, either. I mostly enjoyed the heavy, oily mouthfeel (although it did get a little old by the end of the can). This is a solid IIPA that I would definitely drink more of...if we could get it in Colorado"

"A very nice DIPA, it receives high marks for appearance, palate, and initial flavor. The alcohol (9.1%) never appears in either the taste or follow up stomach response. The tall skinny can fits into the pocket much better than the standard 12 oz can."

"double IPA in a can, September enjoy by date. pours a dark orange with finger and a half of white head into tulip glass. aromas of mango, pineapple, very tropical. flavors of caremalized sugar and fruits, with a bit of grapefruit in the finish, lot of mango. very creamy"
"o: excellent beer. looking forward to the rest of the four pack"
""
""
""

"O - I did have this a touch past prime but I won't hold that against the beer. It was slightly one-dimensional but I believe this was the intention. Resin and pine are the prevailing flavors and it's quite enjoyable. The finish was shockingly clean as well. Well done brew."
""
""
"Re-visiting the first dipa I ever bought, and the beer that got me into the ipa/dipa style. First, the aroma and taste are dominated by pine and then a little grapefruit, but mainly pine. This lends to a bitter dipa despite a sold malt backing. The malt consisting of some bread and some caramel sweetness. I must say while this is a  good beer, but after a year of beer drinking this beer is tasting different to me. I remember the citrus/floral aspect being big, but I don't recall the pine being so dominate when I last tried it in 2013. Overall I'd say this is a solid dipa, however, the pine isn't pleasant to me. The malt helps to balance the bitter/pine a bit, but not enough. Still, this is a beer I will revisit, and one that I would recommended. (85/100)"

"O. This is another great beer from Sixpoint that's not far off from Hi-Res in my book. Has a little less sweetness and more hop bite than Hi-Res making for a more classic tasting and easier drinking DIPA."

"O - A really smooth, fresh hop, easy to drink, light Double IPA."
""
"O - A really enjoyable double IPA that really is easy to drink for being over 9%. Wonder what it would taste like fresh, however the beer is really enjoyable. It goes down almost to easy, with no sign of alcohol. Another must try for IPA lovers, and I promise you will not be disappointed, cheers!"

"Resinous to be sure but there is alot of mild citrus and earthy flavors from the hops as well. You feel all the 100+ IBUS as well as the alcohol. Good DIPA, could be cleaned up a bit and the hops more centralized to the big pine and dank resin that the name promises."
""
""
"Watching the Blues today on NBC vs the Blackhawks and I gotta use Doc Emerick's line here...'My Goodness'. I've had this on tap also-just as great. Why oh why has this not been in my lineup. Not a far cry from his older brother Hi-Res. Love what Sixpoint has been doing. Tremendously tremendous! And by the way...Stanley Cup Champions Blackhawks won!"
""
""
"Solid IPA. Golden color. Not overwhelming in smell or taste but packs a punch. Refreshing taste, goes down smooth and easy. Better than average, high in alcohol but you can't taste the Alcohol. Had this beer on tap but it tasted like they might have had it a while. Worth a try."

"I won't bore you with a full review. The name says it all. A piney-resinous taste unbelievably balanced with some malt on the backbone. Absolutely delicious! Hard to believe its. 100 IBU's because it is so well balanced. Smooth and drinkable. The 4-pack isn't enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Too bitter at the start, taste better as it sits and warms. Good color and mouthfeel but expected a richer, more syrupy character to balance the high ABV. Had the """Florida Man""" imperial IPA the other day at Cigar City and this similar beer does not quite hold up to that level of excellence"
""
""
""
""
"Edit: my comments and descriptions remain about the same. However, I have bumped my ratings just a little. Reason for this is that I keep buying this beer, and it keeps impressing me, which makes me buy another four pack etc etc. This really is a very fine IIPA, and I think it's Sixpoint's best beer."

But I've also recently had HI-RES from Sixpoint for the first time, and I must say, that has RESIN beat hands down. Nonetheless, a decent beer."

"Overall, a decent DIPA, I would definitely categorize this as Northwest IPA, it lives up to its name, the piney hops are a bit too much to my liking and stick around with you for a while. Well made, a little unbalanced and not my favorite DIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a non see through apricot hue with a sudsy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is sweet waffles,resinous piney hops,caramel candy,liquorice and light citrus,the mouthfeel is full bodied and lightly carbonated with tastes of caramel candy,blood orange,a touch of toffee and finished with a resinous sticky piney hop bitterness and overall it's quite an approachable IIPA that comes in a cool little can and I'd buy again cheers."
""
"Overall: This, like other Sixpoint brews I've had (been a little while), is fantastic. Highly recommended to anyone who likes IPAs. Also as a side note, I kinda like the tall skinny 12oz can. I know it has no effect on the brew inside, but it is kinda cool. Maybe just the novelty of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz can into pint glass. Oh my god. No. I do not like this beer!! I thought I would like the super pineyness, but its like sucking on a teet of pinesol. Very oily, mechanical, industrial taste. Glad I can say I've tried it, but never again! Maybe this is what pine tree's themselves drink."
""
"This is a good but definitely unbalanced DIPA. I’d recommend going straight to Hi-Res which is a notch above in more than just ABV."
"Clear golden pour with vanishing head. Smells of honey and piney hops. A nice malty sweetness with fresh grapefruit citrus hop flavors. The finish is sweet with a touch of spiciness to it and lingering grapefruit / astringent bitterness. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel. The relation to Hi-Res is apparent and I think Resin is the better beer. I would prefer a drier finish and a cleaner finish. Not a bad """IPA""" but not my favorite."
""
"Great imperial IPA, smooth and crisp, I have it up against a 90 minute DogFish Head and it is neck and neck, complete hops profile difference and great to have both actually."
""
""
""
"While not an overly strong beer, this packed enough of a punch that I found feel the alcohol and warming effect long before I polished this off. Sixpoint has some great offerings and while this certainly wouldn't be a bad choice to grab, there are better examples from Stone and Victory on the shelf now. In such a crowded field, the can is the more prominent way that this stood out. Worth a go for hopheads or someone who wants a West coast fix from a beer brewed back east."
""
"Overall: Does Sixpoint make other beers? Must. Find."
"Overall a big, juicy, bitter beer. Really well done by Sixpoint."
"Overall, an interesting DIPA. I like it as a sipping beer, but I tried to drink a pint with dinner and it just dominated everything I tried to pair it with. To my palate, the hops are a bit to coarse and dominated by pine at the finish to make this one of my top DIPAs. It's nice to sip, but it's a bit overwhelmingly one dimensional on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Intense, but fairly well balanced. It's a solid beer that's definitely worth trying. For me, not a sessionable beer, unless you're into drinking liquid pine trees. Yet, I still like it and will have it again. Next time, preferrably on tap."

"O- A very tasty beer. One of my top 5 IPAs so far. The flavors/smell/taste all balance great, with 9.1% ABV to boot! Definitely grabbing this again!"
"Pours copper tending towards amber with a 2 finger thick pure white head that dissipates to a thin sheet with tiered lacing. Smell is, well...resinous. Big piney hops with a faint sweetness and a little astringency. Taste is a wallop of hops up front, piney and slightly medicinal with a sticky sweetness, not too bitter. Mouthfeel is a just a little to the slick side but fairly well carbonated. Overall, a damn nice Double IPA to pick up. Nothing utterly life-changing, but definitely worth a pickup."

"Almost two fingers of fairly dense foam, lots of mixed sized bubbles which tends to dimple the surface, keeps a nicely thick coating across the surface for some time and the strings of lacing, while thin, stick like glue. Very gauzy haze to the otherwise borderline luminescent orange to yellow color, opaque with a very fine particulate visible, similarly the carbonation is active but so tiny you have to peer way up close to see it. The nose plays it straight up, maybe somewhat high toned, slaps on the pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus, pine sap, bread crust, saline, pressed dried flowers, cocoa and a wedge of apricot and peach fruit, leaves a drying sensation in your nostrils, kind of a masculine showoff. Full-bodied, thick and layered even as the dryness sucks all the moisture out of your mouth. The carbonation gives it a creamy texture but it is hard to register this. The grapefruit, lime, orange citrus has flavor but not so much sweetness, lacks length. So, it’s the pine, salt, cut grass, pepper led spice and pumpernickel type bread which gets out to play. Teeters on the edge of too dry and bitter but manages to stay relatively balanced. Masks alcohol decently. Not sure I could drink more than two in a sitting, the second would be a slow affair."

"Poured from a can into a snifter, this beer appears a hazy honeycomb color with a two finger white head. The aroma is very citrusy, with no floral or hop aromas. The mouth feel was smooth with just a little bit of an alcoholic bite. The taste isn't overly hoppy, which I was surprised by. It was actually very well balanced between a piny, fresh hoppiness on the front of the tongue with a clean, sweet citrus flavor going down the throat. Overall a very good beer and would definitely recommend."

" I started drinking this before eating, but enjoyed it more with spicy chicken chili. Had another after eating, and liked it even better. Overall very good."

"Easily one of the best DIPA's. Heavy piney bitterness with medium citrus (grapefruit mostly) notes. fairly light bodied especially out of the can. One of the best selections from a very strong lineup of sixpoint brews. I've had this on tap a few times as well, which leaves it a little mellower on the bitterness and a creamier body."

"The hop aroma sprang from the can as soon as I pulled the tab, and I knew I was in for a treat. It poured a golden amber with a nice frothy head with plenty of lacing. The aroma had loads of citrus and floral hops and the first taste exploded with hops that started at the front of my tongue and raced through my palate. The Resin had a well balanced hop profile with some soft pine notes along with the citrus and floral hops. The alcohol presence was noticeable but not overbearing. Overall a solid Double IPA."

"Taste starts with pine, then hop resin, followed by more pine and bread with a grapefruit and lemon finish. Has a resinous, bready, lemony aftertaste. Has an average body and high carbonation for a DIPA. A bit too much carbonation in my opinion."

This was the second hardest round to judge because hop stoopid was phenomenal as well but they are 2 different beasts... resin is sweeter, maltier and a lot smoother... but again, two different beasts.

"Received this from a friend along with a DFH Burton Baton.I've looked forward to trying this beer since the hype surrounding it started to build.Very pleased initially after being met by a very fragrant nose upon cracking open the can.Very floral,some stonefruit and only a slight,soft citric note.It poured beautifully as well,a vibrant peach/orange with just shy of two full fingers of lumpy,ivory foam and raised rings of lacing.Overall,taste was a little disappointing.Too much ripe green apple and soft clover hops.Bitterness was almost more of a sour tang than a pine or citric hop quality and this beer suffered for me from a discouragingly thin mouthfeel.It is easily one of the softest,least belligerent DIPAs that I've ever had and maybe because of a name like Resin and a claim of 103 IBUs I was expecting something a little more formidable.Good DIPA but just not quite worthy of it's acclaim as far as I'm concerned."

Getting a 4 pack of this is almost as hard as getting heady topper and I live 2 and a half hours away from the Alchemist! Next time I am in NYC hitting up Brooklyn and touring SixPoint!"
""
""
""

"Overall- The best IPA I have ever had but keep in mind I liked it because it lacked the bitterness that most people enjoy in their IPAs."
"Clear, orange amber colored body, with a smaller than typical head for the style, but with a lot of latent carbonation steamers. The smell was a bit more subdued than I expected, with some grapefruit and mango, and ironically not a lot of pine resin. The taste was a bit more of a hop showcase, as there was a lot of herbal notes up front. The malt showed up more forcefully shortly afterwards, and gave a tropical punch (mostly orange and pineapple) like sweetness, before fading away into a floral hop finish. Clean feel in the mouth, tending be be neither too slippery nor too sticky. Not the best DIPA I've ever had, but very comforting to fall back to a familiar pleasure from time to time."

"o: An exceptional DIPA. Less strong and bitter than the numbers would suggest. I would definitely put this up there with some of the best DIPAs."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer in my humble opinion. I don't remember the price, which probably means it costs around the same as all the other singles I bought on my last trip. I would love to have another sometime again and I strongly recommend it. It's not a beer for people that want to brag about ultra bitter or ultra dark or ultra lace, but it's a damn good full-bodied delicious beer."

"Poured a golden orange body with reddish tint with a two-finger head and lace on top of a very earthy, piney citric hop aroma although there are touches of grapefruit and sweet malts. Medium bodied and smooth, this beer tastes like it smells with a prevelant hop taste profile, dirty, earthy citric hops with touch of grape and there is some minor sweetness (fruit hops or caramel?). Finishes clean with a little crispness thanks to carbonation and ABV is hidden. Affordable and dangerously high ABV sippin' DIPA that is a must try."
"Really well done here. Very drinkable and complex beer with what you want from a DIPA. Hops are juicy and have more than bitterness for character. Very good."
""

"o: I probably would have liked a little more hop flavor to go along with the palate wrecking bitterness, but this was pretty damn satisfying as is."

"Hazy, honey golden with a lumpy tan head that leaves sheets of crusty lace on the glass. The aroma is dank, fresh hops. Grapefruit and pine sap with caramel and toasted grain. The flavors are harmonious between resinous, dank hops, candied grapefruit rind and caramel slathered toast. Notes of mint and herbaceous evergreen linger on the palate, lots of christmas tree. Smooth, creamy and full bodied with prickly carbonation. My go to DIPA this summer for my hop fix Resin is a nearly perfect example of what I like in the style. A must try for hop heads."

"The feel makes this beer a pleasure to drink. It's smooth, but that comes off a hard biting crispness that's never lost. A chalky sort of dryness comes through but the sweetness keeps it from going too dry. The medium body, almost full, supports all the hefty structure. Carbonation keeps it even but lively all the way."
""
"A very nice IIPA. This is definitely putting the lupulin resin on a pedestal, and it works well. Not super aggressive, but definitely strong."

"Comes in slim can, pours with a thicker consistency and thick head that last long. Amber gold hazy look. Awesome fruity smell rounded with stong hops. Alcohol is well blended in the taste and not noticable even in aftertase. A must have Imperial IPA, on an expansive side though."

"O- Very drinkable for a beer this size. Bitterness isn't an extreme, which I'm a big fan of. This is a great (and perfectly named) DIPA."

"It's cool that this beer comes in a smaller can like a Red Bull for the appropriate ABV it is. A really solid DIPA from Sixpoint."

"Pours a hazy dark amber with a frothy white head which leaves a nice cap. Aroma of slight grapefruit but more of an earthy pine hop smell. Flavor is predominately floral, piney hops with a fair amount of bitterness. There is a little sweet malt in the background with a hint of citrus but not much. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty good IPA overall, not as well balanced as some but refreshing and flavorful."

"Tasting this has the hops piling into my mouth and creating a warming sensation, juicy with bitterness I expected, along with a thick & sticky mouthfeel and more carbonation than it shows. Very nice balance of bread and caramel sweetness along with the dominant hops, and the aftertaste is superb with the fruit note remaining amidst the rest of the flavor sensation. This tasty hop creation lives up to its name quite well."
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: As I made my way through my four-pack, I decided this beer just isn't as great as I made it out to be. The alcohol taste is a bit too harsh to completely enjoy the beer. Still pretty tasty, but not worth the rating that I had it at originally."

"O-A damn good DIPA. Hop forward taste but it smells exceptional and is very drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden."

"O: I like this beer, I really do. It is like a less intense hoptimum. A peppery, spicy, boozy, bitter sonofabitch that takes your tongue on a ride. Love it. I think hoptimum is definitely better executed, but thats why Ken gets the big bucks."

"Final Thoughts: I was worried buying this beer because I had no idea how old it was (despite a 'best before' date). After reviewing Resin I look into it and find out that this one was canned in February. Glad I didn't know it was so old at the time of the purchase because it has held up quite well. Would I drink it again? Sure, especially if Sixpoint switches to a 'canned on' date."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a very good DIPA. Strong hop notes, but very well balanced. Very good from top to bottom. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer, but not one I'm itching to revisit. The hop profile in this beer is unique among IPAs I've had, and I think with fair reason. It is really close to being nice and refreshing, particularly for a 9abv beer, but the bitterness and dryness really left me wanting more refreshment than I was getting."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty strong. Nice hue, lots of carbonation, great head, and some very nice lacing. Floral pine resin in the nose. Bitter syrupy pine with a slight sweet tone. Simplicity is sometimes the best. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"If drinking a liquid onion sounds good to you then this beer is right up your alley. The beer looks and smells like a typical IPA, with assertive hops, bread and a mild fruity aroma. The taste is completely different however, overpowering onion flavor. Pretty gross really. I finished it, but won't be getting this again."

"Overall, good solid DIPA, but nothing mind blowing or really all that unique. I would drink this again without hesitation, but I would prefer more enhanced citrus notes and a slightly better mouth feel. In the end, good beer though from Sixpoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like the head on this beer... Great retention, but larger bubbles than I'm used to seeing from IPAs; but the lacing is fairly poor. The aroma is very floral and super hoppy but with a candy-like sweetness behind. The taste is great for the style, but this isn't my IPA. Too much of piney/resinous hop character. I admit that it is well balanced and has the great hop forwardness people enjoy in DIPAs; however, I just can't get into this beer. I find this beer a tad thin for a DIPA too. I do enjoy the hop bite on my tongue. I'll definitely suggest this beer for people who like more pine or resin or earth in their IPAS."

"Resin is a fantastic looking DIPA. Huge head, hazy orange body with visible carbonation, it's what I want to see when I pop open a double IPA. The aroma is big and sweet, with sweet tropical hops and sweet caramel malts. The taste isn't quite as sweet as the nose, with some more hop bitterness kicking its way through. It's a balanced bitterness, as the bitter and sweet aspects from the hops are kinda in a tug-of-war the whole time. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Sixpoint Resin is a great DIPA."

"Overall: Hard to find anything spectacular in this beer. Its good, I would buy it again but wouldn't seek it out aggressively"

"Pours deep orange hazy and has a two finger head of of off white foam that fell fairly fast but left nice thick lace. Nose is great. Piney hops, lots of resins, tangerine and grapefruit. As a point of interest -the tangerine in this beer literally fills up your mouth like a real tangerine. It’s is the most accurate tasting of a specific fruit in a beer that I have ever noticed. Good citrus with a sugary and pungent nose. Taste is breaddy with a honey sweetness. Woody grassy hops play off the ripe fruit and the citrus lends a slight pucker. Silky malt that has plenty of caramel and brown sugar. Finishes nice and bitter with a bit of grapefruit, a bit of alcohol warmth and plenty of oils to coat the palate; but they don’t disturb the palate. It’s a little chewy in the finish with strong tea like qualities and toasted malt flavor. Grand."

"A heavier feel for an IPA. Slightly sticky. Powerful bitter smack here. Fresh juicy hops create quite a citrus-bomb. Moderately bitter finish, though not harsh. Pungent hop presence. A wonderful beer here that cures my bitter-fix. One I'd like to have again. Love the can format."

"I heard so much love for this one and then was surprised to see it finally distributed near me out of nowhere one day. Tried it with my beer nerd friends as the star of a party. It was pretty but none of us liked it. The name of the beer certainly doesn't lie, but we all felt it focused solely on a bitter spike to the mouth at the expense of anything else, with a not-great flavor to boot. And I like my strong IPAs these days. Won't be getting this one again."
""
"I really like this beer. I waited until I'd had a few four packs over the last few weeks to review it, but I've now decided it's one of my week-in-week-out beers. Beautifully balanced with just enough malt sweetness to balance the beautiful citrusy hops with a nice little bite of bitterness at the end. This is not an over the top beer, but one that has found the most important quality- wanting to go back to it again and again."
""
""
"O: This is an excellent DIPA. Having had this ale fresh and cellared, I can say that it definitely improves with age. Just a fantastic beer overall. Sixpoint continues to impress me."
""
"O: This was a pretty well-executed DIPA that I'll be glad to have around in cans. It doesn't have the fruitier hop flavors that are my preference, but that's a minor quibble. My biggest complaint is that the aroma amount leaves something to be desired. Perhaps a bit more dry hopping would improve the situation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad at all. Not sure if it's because it's a couple months old but the hops seem more all out bitter rather than flvorful or aromatic. I may try it again if I see it on tap but I think this 4 pack will pretty much be enough for me."

"From the skinny can right after an Anti-Hero. Pours golden orange and clear with a fluffy two finger head. Big earthy pine and grass aroma and interestingly something that smells almost oaky. Big slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Pine bitter dominates but fades into some sweet malt and then back to a very dry bitter pine finish. The malt profile really balances this nicely while letting the hops shine. Very good and accessible DIPA now that we have it in Gainesville...and I can convince people it’s just an energy drink from the can ;-)"

"Pours a hazy amber with fluffy white head, sparse patches of fine lace left behind. Smell: a bit muted, but nice... papaya-y tropical fruit, tangerine, pine, mildly sweet. Taste: pine and sweet citrus along with an almost syrupy pale malt sweetness, lingering grapefruit peel. Medium bodied, almost chewy, then finishing juicy with oily hop everywhere. Not a world beater, but delicious. This had a far off date on the 4pk holder... Oct '13 or so."

"O: I am finding that I prefer more of the citrus, grapefruit-y IPAS. I don't want to say it is like Ruination (because that is my favorite), but if you stripped away all the citrus and complexity of it, with a few less IBU's, then this would be that. However, I know a lot of people will like that it is a strong DIPA in a can."
"Overall: Good DIPA but not as good as the standards of the class. The hops in this are a bit one note but at the same time the malt character does not really highlight them. An overall quality beer that I would definitely drink again, but not a standout in any way."
""
"O - Definatly not bad, but not great. I've been wanting to try this one for a while and pleased I did. A good beer with a great nose."
""
""
"O- If you want a hop bomb, it's the way to go. I would have never guessed it's 9.1% ABV either, so that makes it a bit dangerous as well."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a pretty damn solid IIPA. The best part of this beer is that it is an everyday beer (~$10 for a 4-pack) that can kill you with hops."

"Overall a very good beer which I will likely buy again if I see it fresh. Not the greatest readily available DIPA, but a damn fine option."
""

"O - this is a good beer, it's just not my cup of tea. The hop profile is just too dank and earthy for me. I prefer a little brighter citrus floral hop."

"a great beer, appropriately named. the can looks like an energy drink, and the beer feels supercharged like one as well. pouring a cloudy orangey sticky color with a thick and creamy white head. the nose and taste are identical in this beer. its hops all the way, almost like oil extracts or something, the hops are very intense. some pine, but mostly just bitter from a flavor standpoint. its also quite yeasty, which I think fleshes out the hops in a good way, makes the beer more dynamic. there is a lot of dankness to this, resinous as hell, perfectly named. at first I was down on the can, but now I know it makes this unique beer stand out even more, and its also about the correct dose, much more of this and I would be shitfaced. scarily easy drinking though with a really refreshing creamy feel and plenty of little bubbles making it move. all the sixpoint beers ive had so far have been phenomenal, and this is the best of the bunch for me to date. deserves to be mentioned with some of the big boys of this genre, every bit as good as them all. get some if you can."

"For the money, a decent pick and worth trying: very good, but nothing that reaches the level of excellence for my tastes. At $8.99 a 4 pack, you can pour this high abv DIPA down your neck for a good buzz if that is your thang."
""
""
""
""
"O - I can't believe the number of times I've walked past this at the store. Definitely a regular purchase from now on. Great taste, mouthfeel, and smell. What more can you ask from an IPA? If you're a fan of IPAs, Resin has to be on your list of Hads - if not All Time Favorites list. Cheers."

"A good DIPA that lives up to its name, I thought these cans were pints for some reason, still a decent value & pretty drinkable"

"This is a big IPA, but lacks the citrus and sweetness in its hops. It drinks thick, finishes bitter, and it has all the qualities I like in any no-nonsense beer. It does leave a little to be desired if it's the only beer you're drinking that evening, but mixes in to a series of beers (if you've devoted the evening to trying various beers). Resin is my go-to beer when something else I've tried doesn't live up to my exceptions."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a snifter. Pours a orange yellow with a nice fluffy white head that leaves some nice lacing. Smells of floral hops with slight piney and earthy tones, very inviting. Tastes of piney and earthy hops with high malt body and slight soapy feel, probably from the resin. Medium bodied beer has higher carbonation than expected but still finishes very well. Overall, a very good beer."
"Pours a mostly clear, classic golden color with an eggshell colored head that is just the right size. It's a nice looking beer. Smells like a piney pilsner. Doesn't drink like a pilser. Full, oily mouthfeel and pretty obrusive hop explosion. There's quite a bit of alcohol noted in the flavor too. I think it has pretty good balance despite the big hop presence. I like it."

"The 9% ABV is incredibly well integrated into the taste. It is not noticeable in the least. The hop bitterness is also mellower than I would expect and subtle. What I like about this beer is that it is drinkable but you don't realize how much alcohol you are putting away until the end."

I like the pine resin (if you don't disregard my review) but i didn't find it overwhelming and there are other tastes and feelings in this beer. Its not the best imperial ipa I've had but its a solid beer and if you can deal with the resin then this is a quality beer."
""
"Overall: Certainly lives up to its name. I like what Sixpoint is doing with this beer. A nice and radical change from the fruity Imperial IPA's. I know there are IIPA's with piney characteristic, but Resin is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"I recently did a horizontal tasting of some of my favorite IPA's Resin still shined, but honestly, so did the others and one or two of them, there were attributes about them that I liked even better than Resin"
""
""
"O- very drinkable and very good. This one is pretty unique, has some candy flavors to it and its not too bitter. My favorite six point by far."
""
""
""
"O- Yep, this IPA is no joke when it comes to bitterness. Almost a chore to finish a pint. If you want a beer to scrape the enamel off your teeth, look no further."
"Pours a toasted, hazy amber hue into my tasting glass. The tall can it comes in reminds me of a 'Red Bull.' An initial frothy head recedes to barely a thin ring, but on the plus side there is a sticky mess of lacing down the glass. Great look. It's smells wonderful - mostly pineapple, grapefruit, cream & caramel. Fairly straightforward. The flavor exudes the 'resinous' variety of hops as the name suggests, but also a subtle caramel, candy-ness of the malts, and a certain earthy aspect I cannot quite put my finger on, but I like it. It's mouthfeel is medium, just coating the mouth thinly, with an alcohol heat that you notice before long. The beer is numbing on the back of your throat, leaving you wanting another pleasant sip. Overall, this is simultaneously sweet and bitter. A great east coast IPA. Well done Sixpoint, a brewery close to home."

"I've had 4 or 5 of these now (not at once) and have to say that they're a bit inconsistent. I really feel like some cans had noticeable differences. Still, it's good beer. Great citrus-y aroma and nice taste. Like Heady Topper, it's got kind of a resiny feel to it, which is a bit too much sometimes, but overall, just a nice orange-y colored citrus-y DIPA. I like the 12 ounce cans too!"
""
""
""
"Mild malt and then a grapefruit infused hop explosion. Smooth body, but comparatively thin to other IPAs. No truly an DIPA, closer to the American version of an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer for tasting. A whole can of it will fuck up the drinker thereof pleasantly"
""
"Overall a decent IPA worth trying. For 103 IBU, the hops were surprisingly subtle and tamed. Or maybe my palette is just wrecked from tasting so many IPAs today."
""
"Overall, pretty unspectacular. This beer represents its name very well in both the nose and flavor so if you're into the very sappy and resiny DIPAs, then this might be right up your ally. That being said, its not what I prefer in my DIPAs so this is likely the last time I'll enjoy this one."
""
"O - Overall, this was pretty damn good. Perfectly balanced and very drinkable for the ABV. I'd definitely have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some may find this beer a little over the top, but I find it just about right for a member of the double IPA family. It isn’t too extreme, but it definitely packs in the hops and is memorable and recommended to hopheads everywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!!"
""
""
""
"Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is bubbly, never sticky. Overall this may be my favorite go to DIPA. For the price it really doesn't get better than this for me. This beer made me repent of my not liking can beers. Thank you Six Point, you just keep doin what you're doin there guy."
""
""
"Overall I would say this is one of my favorite beers, being a big IPA fan. I also like the price on the Resin. 8.99 for a 4-pack of 12 oz cans. 9.1 abv"
"12 oz tall can, poured into glass. Golden, and mostly clear. Thick beady head quickly dissipated. Sweet piney aroma with hints of malt and alcohol. A burst of bitterness up front, followed by piney hops, leaving warming alcohol and a bit of toasted. The alcohol is more prominent as the beer warms, which adds to the beers complexness. A very good imperial ipa- not just a overload of hops, the malt characteristics pair well with the piney hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate to low retention, on a copper body with some haziness. Lacing is clear and quick to slide away. Aroma includes peach and persimmon with some apricot and some malt sweetness in the background. Taste includes some caramel sweetness and some hop bitterness but far from the amount expected, given the name and style. I actually checked the date of the keg to make sure it was fresh and it is from 12/2012. No issues there. My nose and palate seem to be working correctly, so I suppose that the beer is just a bit lacking in the """resin""" department. Kind of disappointing on almost every level."
""
""
"I had it before, but never had the opportunity to rate it, and even without the first surprise it felt even better. Excellent beer making extremes to balance. Not a beer for the ones who like Adjunct lagers with low mediocre hops that needs to be drunk stupidly cold not to feel the taste (or off-tastes) of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent imperial IPA – needed more hops in my opinion – came through too much on the malty side."
""
"Overall a tasty DIPA with a uprising attempt at balance."

"A brilliant beer and worth every penny. My only gripe is that the beer sells out quickly and"

""
""

"Kinda feel the same way with my homebrew. Go figure."
""
"This is a fine DIPA, but nothing special. Heavy on the hops, but it really needs more in the nose in order to shine. Balance is pretty good, but there's nothing notable about it. Lots of bitter, lots of sweet buoyant malts, but no flavor that I can really latch onto."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice beer with a very nice, sweet malt character that I'm a sucker for as well as a potent, intense hop character. I enjoyed this one. The alcohol was a tad over the top at times, but it didn't really detract from the flavor or the drinkability. It's definitely worth a try."
""

""
""
""

"Resin is an appropriate name for this. Definitely has that syrupy piney thing going on. Kind of one dimensional, but it's nice. Good body and character. I can deal with this well over all the other mediocre crap of the night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good DIPA that unfortunately hits just a few wrong notes in its flavor profile that prevents it from being truly world-class. Still quite good and drinkable, just not the total home run it might be with just a couple of minor tweaks to the taste."
"A very nice DIPA. Worth seeking out."
"O - this is a pretty awesome IPA with the right amount of sticky hop sweetness and abv that's hard to notice."
""
""
"Overall – A pretty tasty double overall. A bit on the sweeter side but with a good balance of hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I think this is a great double IPA. It could definitely get better in the color and aroma category, but i feel these two areas don't detract from my overall impression of this beer. The bitterness is just slightly overpowering at the end, but again I think it fits the style at the high end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - I like the hop flavor but needs a touch more bitterness to balance the sweetness."
""
""
"Pretty good, very hoppy, quite intense. The slight underlying funkiness keeps it from being great, though."
""
""
""
"12 oz can pours a medium amber with fluffy white head and ample lacing. Yeah, the aroma reminds me of resin with lemon, apricot, and alcohol. Taste is nice and bitter pine and citrus, a bit oversweet on the malt backing though. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel seems a bit flat - would appreciate a little more carbonation. On the other hand, the tongue-coating thickness of this beautifully bittered imperial is fanstastic. Aftertaste is puckering. I really wanted to like this more - I love resinous beers (Green Flash!) so I imagined a beer called """Resin""" to be near perfect. But this one has crossed a bit over the line into surgary territory"

"D: a very well-made DIPA. great flavors, full body, hoppy nose. everything one would want. not a blow-a-way, but still very tasty and a good example of a DIPA."
"Overall: Not bad at all. This IPA has its own unique taste and balance of hops and malts that stands out. Can't complain about this beer, I'd drink it again."
"Style rating: 4.25 Personal: 4.25"

"O- very drinkable for the alcohol content"

"My whole issue with them has been the Lion contract and consistency. If Sixpoint would ever take total control of all their brewing, in house, they could be a top notch brewery. Still, I'll give them props as this one was fantastic."

"O - A pine hop bomb of a double IPA. Dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
"Gotta love the Red Bull-style cans employed here. This stuff pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit rind, pine resin (how appropriate), thickly earthy and spicy greens, mild toffee, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with the emphasis on the earth, spice, and pine, and with some light balsa joining the party as well. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a refreshingly earthy hop-bomb, one that definitely uses plenty of hops but does so without burning the tongue and without completely ignoring the concept of balance."

"Sixpoint Resin is a clear, golden ale covered in a soft, thick, yellowed foam that leaves intricate lacing on the glass. It has a strong, fresh aroma of grapefruit and lumber. It smells almost a touch sour-- """nose tart""". It's very full and soft in the mouth and it leaves the tongue a little singed. It's bursting with fresh hop flavor and quite bitter. Grapefruit peel bitterness becomes wooden and, finally, resiny at the finish and throughout the aftertaste, where it picks up some juniper and black pepper. The whole affair is pretty dry. I really love a beer like this. It's strong and heavy enough to support all those hops and the malt never creates any conflict."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is a solid representation of what I feel that a D-ipa should be. The strong but not really bitter citrus, the stickiness with plenty of lacing on the glass and a high alcohol content. I put it in the top 4 of my personal favorite D-ipa's"
""
"Taste, remarkably similar to Bigfoot with a year or two on it. Hop edge and bitterness are down, hop flavors of pine and citrus are evident though. Pretty viscous. Really should be discussed as a barleywine in my opinion, but at the same time, despite what the majority thinks, its just a matter of degree and subtle differences between some dipas and barleywines. Relatively easy to drink for a 9% beer. I like the unique can shape and size, its like you're holding an energy drnk. Really makes for good sneaking into college football games, security just thinks you are drinking some rare -bal red bull or something. I guess the resiny aspect might be because of the beer's stickiness and viscosity moreso than it being dank."
"O: An IPA that lives up to it's name. Balanced."
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer and my second favorite Sixpoint beer after The Crisp lager. THis beer is straightforward resiny hops, but it does a good job of delivering the goods if that's what you're looking for."
"O - It seemed more bitter at first, but the bitterness waned. I got a feeling this could be old."

"O- This was one of the few Sixpoint's I've had, and I have to say, I'm not dazzled yet. Maybe I need to try it from the tap before I totally disregard the beer. Maybe I was getting my hopes up too high. I like the appearance that the can and the beer portray, but then again, you can't always judge a book by its cover."
""
""
""
"Overall this was fantastic. Will definitely be on the lookout for this again. Great DIPA!"
"This is the third Sixpoint beer I've had, (Bengali and Sweet Action were both ok) and this one is quite good.  If I see this on tap I'll have to grab one before I head home."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer and for the price, it can't be beat. I am so glad we got this here in Texas, I can't wait to try the others."
"I REALLY wish I could get my hands on this beer here in MN. It's unbelievably juicy, hoppy and smooth. Great beer!"
"O:  Creamy, juicy and sticky a perfect combination for a DIPA.  Complex and well combined this is one I will surely look for any time I get  within reach.  Given the ABV this is a sneaky predator that would easily tank you quickly without realizing it. What has two thumbs and loves Resin?  This guy!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE - Since this review, I have had a number of additional servings of Resin and my opinion has changed. Might've been some quality issues since that first 4 pack, but since then I have grown to enjoy it. Not the best DIPA out there, but pretty solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One of my go-to year-round DIPAs, the unique brown sugar flavor/aroma is something I haven't come across in an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a big DIPA. A real, full-bodied beer. This is not for the casual IPA drinker. For those who are searching for the best DIPA, this is a must try. This doesn't fit the mold and is different and better than the average DIPA."
""
""
"Really like this one. Glad to see it on the shelves in Round Rock, Texas. Price point is good too. Will certainly have again. Welcome to Texas Sixpoint!"
""
"(O)- Overall, one of the better DIPA's I have had in a long time. Expertly balanced and incredibly refreshing. Very well done, this will definitely be sighted in my fridge in the future."
"A very beautifully crafted beer. Great carbonation and good body. A must try for the IPA lover."
""
""
""
"The fact that this beer has become easily available (in my area at least) is spoiling me. Hopefully more people across the country will be able to experience this stellar offering from SixPoint."
"I have to go back and check out more from six point because this is on point... geezus, I sound like guy fieri reviewing beers... anyhoo, this is damn good, if you like 90min or feg's hopso, try this, it has a different flavor but belongs in that company."
"Overall: Before I'd tried Resin I didn't even like IPAs. From the glowing review I've given above, I'd hope that you'd now know that Sixpoint has single-handedly changed my mind on the whole issue. Of course, DIPAs are definitely of a different character than IPAs, but even if you prefer darker beers (as I normally do), Resin is a beer I would, and do, recommend to anybody who enjoys beer. Complex, very flavorful, refreshing. Honestly, this was a revelation for me as far as what hops can do for a beer."

"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of resinous pine, with some sweet candy notes also thrown in. I also get a bit of toffee and biscuit malt in the aroma. The flavor is very similar. The pine and resin notes are very apparent, but there is also some juicy orange citrus thrown in for good measure. The biscuit malt is also present and keeps the bitterness in check, although it is definitely present. The hop flavors are very bold and are very well done. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An excellent Double IPA. Glad to have this one in Texas."
""
""
"O: A pretty great DIPA. Much more balanced than I expected thanks to a good amount of maltiness."
""
"Not a bad Double IPA, and its a nice can offering, strange can though looks more like and energy drink than a beer."
"This is not a bad DIPA, but it's not particularly exceptional in any way. Somehow it actually becomes less complex as it warms up. Still, it's not like it's an imperial Bengali Tiger (which was nearly a drain-pour for me). Someday, I still believe I can find a great beer from Sixpoint..."
"I'd drink this again, but since it's coming all the way from New York, and it seems like anything from New York City is ridiculously overpriced. $9 for four-pack? I'm undecided if that's too much or not."
""
""
"From the cool can into the pint glass, the appearance is a slightly hazed amber color with a decent white powder puff on top that deflates quickly to a solid cover and plenty of lacing. The aroma brings a decidedly crisp citrus theme with a subtle pine biscuit and a fair malt presence as a supporting cast. The flavor grabs your taste buds with aggressive citrus grain hops that tingles the tongue. Lots of caramel grain and citrus bite. Body is solidly medium-plus with tiny, sprite bubbles to provide a tingly, refreshing feel despite being a bit on the viscous side. Very nice hop brew!"
""

"This beer is a knockout. Literally. Halfway through the beer I was really feeling it! At 9.1%ABV, this is no joke. It is a perfectly named beer with amazing hop resin oozing from every sip. The perfect balance of bitterness, and it doesn't taste high in alcohol. This beer is dangerous. One of the most balanced Imperial IPAs I've had. This beer is the energy drink of hops (and the can looks like it too)!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I love this DIPA! It's everything I want in the style. Loads of sticky, oily hops, creating a bright sweetness but plenty of bitterness. I know people say this alot, but I would seriously have this in the fridge at all times if I could get it in Oklahoma. It's nice to see a step away from the American Strong Ale, Barleywine category. Seek this out!"
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a perfect pint glass. Light and hazy orange/gold. About a finger of white head that disappears rather quickly. Decent retention on glass. This appears to be a very good beer. Smell is amazing, with sweet pine and citrus aromas and a bit of malt. Taste is where this falls off slightly. I am not disappointed with the taste, but I think it must be a combination of factors that lead to my slightly above average taste rating. Pine and citrus flavors are prominent, but grapefruit rind sort of dries out any sweetness I may have picked up from the smell. It's not bad, but the taste is not as appealing to me as other beers like this. I suppose it is resinous, too. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, almost like a bite of bread, or something similar. Overall this is a decent beer. It's unique, too, and that is why I say that I still enjoy it, even though some elements are not as agreeable as some of my favorite DIPA's. Cheers."
""
"O: A very nice interpretation of a DIPA. And an East Coast version at that. I really like this one and will absolutely come back to it again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm after hops when I have an IPA/DIPA, and this had more malt with it. Again, not bad, but if I'm choosing a Sixpoint offering, I'd rather have their Bengali Tiger or Diesel."
""
"Cheers..."
"O - A fantastic brew. Unique hop character loaded with sweet woody bitters."
"O: Six Point's 'Resin' is a no-nonsense IIPA. It's a whole LOT of bitter, piney hops and not much else. While I appreciate an extra bitter IPA/DIPA as much as the next guy, overall balance and complexity are things that shouldn't be forsaken in order to hit an IBU benchmark. Beers like Sierra Nevada's 'Hoptimum' and Dogfish Head's 'Burton Baton' are shining examples of well-rounded, balanced, complex IIPAs. Resin is more of a one-trick pony (or one-trick Clydesdale!)"
""
""
""
"A nice DIPA, but nothing special."
""
"O-A nice DIPA, good bitterness with a solid hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable if not spectacular example of style I would be happy to try this any time, especially if I could find it on tap."
"O: This beer is deserving of the title Resin and is so much better than I had anticipated. I had feared a hop bomb that was going to be the equivalent of chewing on pine needles but this is a balanced, bitter hop bomb I happy enjoy again and again."
""
""
"1489"
"O: How I like my IPA's. I love the extra body to it and balance of sweetness & hops. Will definitely keep this beer around for myself and to share."
""
""
""
""
"O: This has a couple of nice elements, but overall the non-hop bitterness kills it for me. Excluding that it's well made and I'm wondering if something is off about this batch, though other reviews mention it as well."
""
"Overall: A bit one-dimensional, but appealing for those that like their share of hops."
""
"Mouthfeel: Resin is right in the middle of the road on the body of the beer; easy drinking and yet nice feel to it that the flavors stick around tastefully. I was hoping for a little better hop profile while drinking Resin but it felt a little bit on the muddy side, it is still a very tasty beer just a bit under what I was expecting."

"Overall a very interesting Double out of a can nonetheless a good smack in the face and ruin on the palate from one of my favorite plants the Hop. Havent had my palate this bland since Stones Ruination"
""
""
""
"Overall - For a Double IPA, it's not what I would call """strong""" but as a stand alone IPA, it's very delicious and easy to drink!"
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good DIPA but not a world class one. This was my first Sixpoint brew and am pretty impressed with this one. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this one."
""
""
""
"O: A very bold, fruity and brash DIPA, Resin embodies all that is wonderful about high alpha-acid hops washing away the sweet palate of a big beer. The 9.1% ABV is there, but almost feels smaller beneath the soft, tropical fruitiness of the brew. Make no mistake, though, this is a big, sweet, bitter triumph of a brew."
"Overall - Definitely the best Sixpoint beer I've had so far. It has a nice amount hops and a good dose of fruitiness. Well worth trying if you happen to see it on the shelves."
""
"O: A good, but not great, DIPA. It's a bit old school in it's one-dimensionaless. It has a strong bitterness without much else to back it up. If you love the strong, piney hop bite, then this DIPA is for you. Otherwise, it's interesting to try, but there's not enough drinkibility to make it a mainstay in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was a bit fuller than average. Drinkability was decent for a big IPA. Overall, a fairly average ImpIPA. Worth trying if you see it."
"Overall it delivers what it promises, but not quite drinkable as it's so bitter, resinous, sweet, and a bit boozy. Nice flavors though, and typical well done IPA from Sixpoint."
""
""
"Quite good and it's scary how easy this is to drink. Even the skinny can makes it seem less imposing."
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass. Color was a medium amber with a touch of haze. A few threads of bubbles rose from the bottom. Head was a generous 2 fingers milky white foam. Didn't last long, but clung to the sides very well. Aroma started slightly fruity sweet, and then became a gentle hoppy. Flavor was definitely solidly hops, but not overly bitter or overwhelming. Hoppy, but yet balanced. Felt good in the mouth. A smidge thin on the coating, but otherwise felt good. Overall a very solid well balanced beer."
"O - Bold and hoppy but artfully restrained and balanced, Resin is a hop-head's dream; fruity and bitter but earthy too; unique in it's own right. From the sexy, slender can to the delicious, assertive flavor and dry, lingering finish, Resin is a real joy to partake. And it's year-round!"
"O: Well, this is a great beer. There's not much else to say. I've been grading very difficult on the beers I've recently had, and this one just blows me away. If you haven't tried this, then go out and get some now. One of the best East-Coast IPA. Happy IPA Day!"
""
""
""
"Beer is a hazy mber with a lacy ivory head. Aroma is thick hops. Lots of pine. Taste is less piney than would be expected given the aroma. Malt up front with a bitter, citrus hop finish. Mouthfeel is good. It's nicely carbonated. Overall, a very good dIPA. There are so many good IPAs and double IPAs these days. Resin doesn't stand out in the crowd, but that's not necessarily a negative, as they're in a very high-quality crowd. All in all, an excellent dIPA."
"O: This is a really solid DIPA. No complaints from me."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring, and the softness of the slurp. The taste was thoroughly smooth, sweet, and hoppy, and not overly wrought with caramel or insane bitterness, as is easy for the style. We did, however, wish that the aroma was a bit more robust, as all the great flavors within were a bit dampened by the weak sniffability. Ultimately, this beer is insanely drinkable, but it will catch up quickly with you if you let it."
""
""
"Pine and grapefruit dominate the palate. There is a hint of caramel sweetness to it, and a little spice on the end."
""
"D - Very nice, kind of an i betweener style wise as some of the more bold bakeries might call this a regular IPA. But whatever it is, it's very good with a pungent hop aroma and a flavor that is nearly as well done."
"Overall: this one may have been towards the end of its prime but still nicely balanced. The alcohol is about as strong as the ABV predicts meaning neither well hidden or over the top. Not quite hoppy enough for me for a DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall: a slow sipping big bitter DIPA. Satisfies the need for hops, and any hophead would enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
"D: Impressed with this offering, in fact picked up a second 4-pack the following day and I have a feeling it won't be my last."
"Taste isn't aggressive with the bitterness, instead it's fairly balanced along the middle with the malt and the citrus pine, carbonation is great and lends a nice creamy mouthfeel, finishes slightly dry with a little bit of bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted malt and herbal bitterness up front. Hops become spicier with more citrus as he malt shows some fruit and butterscotch sweetness. Citrus and pine hop bitterness take over the drier finish. Full bodied, creamy smooth feel. Nice!"
"Overall this was a disappointment, especially after the first wave of aroma hit my nostrils. OK, but not something I'd bother with again."
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very good double IPA. It smelled fantastic and the taste fell just short, but I still enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: """Resin""" is a great name for this brew. A very good Double IPA that I will most certainly drink again if the opportunity arises. Awesome, green, skinny, tall 12-ounce can. Hits the mark on every aspect. Well done, Sixpoint!"
"O. Overall, a very enjoyable beer for die-hard hop heads. The relatively low price and availablity makes it a good choice when the harder to find Heady Toppers or Ghandi Bots might not be available."
""
"O - Very solid if unspectacular DIPA. A little less malt would be welcome, but the bitter aftertaste is very nice. Just a touch of alcohol heat. I'd have this again."
"I was in the mood for a double IPA or something similarly piney yet crisp. I was actually planning to get some Sierra Nevada Tornado when this can caught my eye in the package store. I had never had a Sixpoint brew before but decided to give it a try. Wow! Slightly cloudy appearance, tenacious lace on the glass. Great taste, very strongly piney and a little heavy bodied for a dIPA. I really enjoyed this beer's drinkability. I will certainly buy this again. (Note: It did wallop me with a pretty nasty hangover the next morning, which I attributed to the heavy hops and high ABV.)"
""
""
"Overall: Its a good DIPA, but nothing thats unique about it. I love that its a solid beer offering in a can. I wish it was a little better, but its still pretty good beer."

"a cant-miss brew for hop heads. worth seeking out."

"*Apollo is the best Kristallweizen ever, besides the obvious Westenpheerznsiernserm."
""
""
"Overall- Save your money. Though a very good beer, there are so many other DIPA's as well as IPA's which are much better than this. I was very disapointed at the lack of hop aroma for this type of beer. Other than that, it is a solid IPA, nothing special and certainly not worthy of its price tag."
"Overall- A very enjoyable double IPA that I look forward to throwing into my """go to""" beer category!"
""
"Overall if you want a big in your face hop bomb look no further. Not a balanced I2PA but very nice hop forward brew. Might not be world class but fairly tasty."
""
""
"Overall impression: Hops seem a bit subdued to be deemed """Double IPA""". That said, I do enjoy it. Dangerous given the ABV. Seems more like an American Barleywine to me. Regardless, I enjoy it immensely and I will have another."
"I first reviewed Bengali Tiger, The Crisp, Righteous and Sweet Action and I have to say, this beer is by far the best of the group. I have not yet tried Apollo, but I find it hard to believe this would be second to that beer. This brew is a wonderful Eastcoast DIPA."

"overall a solid beer, would definitely purchase again. that said, i'm not blown away by it."

"Decent stuff, I drank my 12 oz can without too much difficulty, but IMO, this is a middling DIPA. I feel my scores are harsh, but despite my qualms, this is a fairly competitive style, and I can't honestly score this beer any higher. Still, this is a beer I recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"That this beer only gets a """good""" rating here is a crime against humanity ranking up there with waterboarding and wes anderson's movies. I'm not sure how it gets tagged as an IPA, because it transcends the genre and becomes something else entirely as you drink it. the color, taste, mouthfeel, and lacing are top-shelf and you really sit there shaking your head trying to figure out why it's so different and good. beer advocate feels like an IPA cult at times and anything that isn't a down-the-middle IPA (Stone, e.g., which is the perfect poster boy for the perfect IPA) gets pushed to the side by the rankers. glad the brothers see this one for what it is, even if the sweating masses don't quite get it."
"Pours a nice bright orange color with a nice white head. Smell is a bit like caramel with piney hops shining through with a bit of citrus. Not entirely appetizing but still pleasant enough. The taste is what may cause me to buy this again, although a bit hot, the piney hops burst over the tonguewith a sticky sweetness from the malt, with a bit of citrus on the back end. Finishes very bitter. Mouthfeel is resiny as the name implies with moderate carbonation. Overall not my first choice for a DIPA but I may buy it again if the mood strikes."
""
""
""
"The taste has a pretty ok flavor with a bready malt base and some nice bitter hops hitting at the back of the palate, rolling over the tongue with a nice sudsy feel. Overall it's not bad, but really it's unremarkable."

"12oz can poured into a snifter, pours orange in color, slightly viscous looking as it comes out of the can, with a fluffy off-white head that holds good retention and leaves sticky lacing on the glass. Tropical aromas of pineapple, mango, citric hop, mandarin orange, honey, with a sticky sweet malt presence, slight grain. Tastes are sweet and tropical up-front with pineapple and mango in the forefront followed by caramel, pungent grapefruit, and piny bitterness, tingly on the tongue as it goes down with a moderate alcoholic warmth. Medium bodied ale with ample carbonation. For being 103ibu it finishes pretty well balanced but has a lingering astringency on the end. Overall, good take on one of my favorite styles."
""
"12 ounce can, stamp on the bottom says best before 26 November 2012. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit), pine hops, and some caramel malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's some earthy/floral hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and it's a bit creamy. I'd like to try this fresher in the future. It's a solid brew, but I prefer other Double/Imperial IPA's compared to this one. With that being said, this is still definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"12 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours extremely hazy red orange color with a dense 2-3 finger khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, floral, caramel, biscuit, grass, and herbal spiciness. Nice aromas with good balance; but are pretty faint for being a DIPA. Taste of big grapefruit, orange, caramel, biscuit, herbal, floral, pine, grass, and earthy spiciness. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, bread, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very malt forward in flavor profile despite being 103 IBU; but still has some good balance. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to sip on for 9.1%; with only a slight alcohol warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice DIPA. Good malt flavor balance with bitterness makes this very smooth to sip on without being overwhelming. Quite enjoyable stuff."
""
"Orange in color with a yellow hue and a deep haze. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet caramel malt aromas up front with earthy ripe grapefruit, pineapple, and pine hops underneath. Aroma gets boozier as this warms. Medium bodied with a resinous feel from start to finish. Earthy, musty, pine hop and sweet malt flavors with citrus hop flavors riding beneath. Finishes with a lingering, musty pine hop bitterness and a noticeable booziness."

"funny shaped can thanks to DoubleSunshine610, appreciate it man. Bright orange color, good head and lace. Smells sticky like hop oils, the name resin is appropriate.

"Big thanks goes out to trader who sent me this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from can into a balloon wine glass. Poured yellow orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, alcohol, spices, earthy hop, subtle citrus, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, floral, spices, spicy hop, earthy hop, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The alcohol notes on this one was fairly evident. There was definitely a huge hop presence in this one, but the alcohol covers a lot of other tones up that I picked up on, but couldn’t place. Worth trying if you get the chance, but that’s about it."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid 2IPA to drink for a long time."
"Overall, a good DIPA, with a ton of hop aroma, but could definitely use a little more in the flavor. Just a little too sweet for my liking."

"O - This is one of Sixpoint's better beers that I have had. All with potential and all with too much caramel malt. The higher alcohol and hop bitterness help balance it out in this beer."

"Sixpoint is a B that could be an A; it is Jimmmy Rollins at bat with 2 men on that turns into a pop-up to the first baseman; it simply could be a better beer. To put it simply, it is the most approachable double IPA I have ever tasted. It starts off with not much carbonation and not much head. THe first sip is easy-going and then WHAM! comes the total hop overload - which is very delicious. On the other hand, it is not up the greatest it could attain. It is not a balanced Double IPA in a way that Dogfish or Rogue makes theirs. Sixpoint's Resin is kinda like Dogfish's 90 minute, but it falls short though...you could call it 83 minutes and 49 seconds IPA."
"Overall - I'm just blown away by this DIPA, a wonderful surprise from a can! This reminds me alot of Double Trouble, and may even contend with Hopslam. This seems to be getting some pretty good distribution, this is one you've got to try. This is my first try from Sixpoint, I will seek out there other beers for sure after this surprisingly wonderful experience."
"4.0 D: Solid DIPA. Great taste and a stellar nose."
"O: Very solid offering, just what I'm looking for in a DIPA. Great hop extraction, just enough malt prescence to keep me happy. My only complaint would be hop bill doesn't seem multidimensional, but alas for the pricepoint a great option. For east coast better than Larry DIPA, just below hop wallop in my book."

"Pours a fairly clear deep copper color with a decent off white head that throws off lots of stickies onto the glass on the way down. Smell like lots of pine, resin, and bits of citrus. Onion and garlic hit me pretty good, but what I can't find is any malt. Probably shouldn't in a double IPA. Taste is bitter and sticky with just a hint of alcohol in there. There's a hint of malt sweetness but the flavor here is all about the hoppage. Resin, pine, garlic, hints of citrus all come together to slap my taste buds to and fro. Lingering resinous bitterness mixed with alcohol long after each sip just begs you to take another sip to wash the taste out of your mouth. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sticky resinous bong water mouthfeel. Nice assault of hops here."
"sidenote: love the video on their website. very interesting and informative with regards to hops and how they're celebrated in this beer."

"Its good, definitely worth trying, but my taste buds are geared more towards the citrusy DIPA's. I have to say, (and I don't mean this as a slam to Sixpoint due to my average score) this is the best offering I've had from them, thus far. Ill still be investing in there products ;)"

"Poured from a Red Bull sized can into a mug, the beer is a hazy, copper-tinged orange coloring with a steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a slight, thin, filmy white coating of head on the surface. Aromas are light and sweet, with a citrusy backbone and subtle hops presence. Smells very inviting and summery. Flavors are rich in hops character, with a dark, wet, and green blast on the tongue and roof of the mouth, followed by the solid malt layered backbone of caramel and citrus sweet highlights. The aftertaste gives you a more resiny, rich, and bitter hops presence, with an overall lightness due to the citrus balance and the increased carbonation. Rich, tangy, and resiny mouthfeel leading into a smooth and slightly astringent and green finish. Decent linger, and smooth overall feel. This is a tasty brew."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, really fresh 7 months from best by date. Pours a cloudy orange with a half inch of white head, that leaves lots of lace. Smell citrus, grapefruit,mango, and pine. Taste is all of those with a good amount of hops, with enough malt to make it well balanced. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, not dry, and very drinkable. This is a very nice and affordable DIPA, especially when fresh. A great beginner DIPA."
""
"M: Like I stated, sweet and syrupy, and I definitely could have used more West Coast-esque grapefruit sizzle on this to even the odds. The lacing was as ridiculous as my blood sugar. Nevertheless, this was a well crafted brew... to hell with balance already though!"
""
"O=Good beer but nothing to go crazy about."
"As far as DIPAs go, the parts are all here but it's as if they've been put together wrong (like a doll's leg glued awkwardly onto the hip). A comparison to American barleywines (or """strong ales""") is an almost inevitable conclusion. Don't expect bright fruits and sunshine. But for those who like a lot of dark, sticky fruits with their hops, definitely give it a go."

"Had a can again a few weeks later, tasty drinkable good hops, not a palate eraser."

"Being from Brooklyn, I wish I loved everything Sixpoint made. But they are hit and miss for me. This one's a miss. Not bad, but not one I need to drink again. I really like Bengali Tiger, Righteous Rye and Otis. The last couple I've tried - Autumnation, Diesel and Resin - I haven't been crazy about. In my opinion, they're not well-balanced, but they're just very hoppy and alcoholic. It's not hard to make a beer like that. Balance is what makes a beer great."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this DIPA and am glad it's easily accessible in the Chicago market now."
"Overall is very, very good. I like this brew, love the can packaging also."
"Overall Impression- I don't understand why some of the higher rankers didn't enjoy this beer. It's a good, well balanced IPA."
"Tastes as it smells. Smoother than I anticipated, almost like hop frosting. It's thick, is the thing. That's nice for the hop because it gives off a sticky hop cone feeling, but the malt is a little syrupy and just too darn bitter and so you don't have enough balance. On top of that, the hop profile is nice and strong but there's just not enough going on there to make it carry the beer."
""
"O-not my favorite style but good beer nonetheless."
""
""
"O - Solid easy drinking DIPA. Well balanced as it is not too sweet, not a hop bomb. However, while good, there is nothing remarkable about this one."
""
""
""
"Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, just a little syrupy in a way that didn’t help the booziness. Not all that fun to drink even for a hop-bomb. I’d take a Hoptimum or GF Palate Wrecker over this one in a heartbeat. Not terrible but not my particular cup of tea for the already crowded DIPA style."
"This is a pretty good DIPA at the price point... not bad at all."
""
"O- pleasantly surprised by this beer. A solid double Ipa."
"O: Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $10.99 for a four pack of cans."
"Overall: A recommended DIPA for fans of the style, plus the tall-skinny can it comes in looks pretty cool. I picked up this reasonably priced 4-pack from Joe Canals in Lawrenceville, NJ. I prefer my DIPA’s with a bit more malt in the finish so this wasn’t one of my favorites, but still a fine beer nonetheless. Lagunitas Hop Stoopid ranks up there as one of my favorite DIPA’s. Try them side-by-side and I think you’ll agree."
"Sweet and juicy, bitter orange peel and grapefruit rind, light yet substantial pale malts in the background. Some light sweetness, the bitter citrus peel keeps it balanced, dry bitter aftertaste. Definitely lives up to its name, fully resiny and slick. Hopefully the next batch to Chicago is fresher..."
""
"Not quite the hop presence I was hoping for, but a solid IIPA for sure."
"O: Certainly one of the most bitter beers I've tried, it lives up to it's name very well. If your palate tends to be destroyed after drinking bitter beers, it will most certainly happen here."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good IIPA. I love the balance of malt and hops. The lemon rind flavor is a little harsh, I could do without that but overall it's a very good beer."

"O= decent for an uber bitter IPA although I followed with a Sneaky Pete and enjoyed it much better. However, I prefer this Resin over Starr's popular Northern Lights IPA."

"I have to say, I have had this a few times.... and was not sure what to make of the first few.... but the more I drink it, The more I crave it... this stuff really grows on you.... at least it did with me.... apperance is a hazy copper tone with a marshmallow like head.... lacing is thick and foamy ...aroma is like that of resin.... (reminds me of high school)taste is of citrus and hops, leaving you quite dry... but yet craving more... Great Job..."
"It is okay, but it has a ton of """off""" flavors that really don't belong in an IPA though they work a little."
"12 oz can served in snifter. The appearance is a hazy gold/orange with a thin layer of white head. Not much in the way of head retention. Some lacing is left around the edges. The nose starts with a bold wave of resinous (imagine that!) hops pair with a bready, cracker like malt profile. Notes of citrus rind and candied tangerine are present along with a touch of honey. The taste starts with some delicate malt sweetness. This comes in the form of graham cracker and caramel. This is followed by an assertive bitter hop profile. Notes of pine needles and grapefruit come through as all 103 IBUs come through as the beer finishes. The mouth feel is moderately heavy with high carbonation. Overall, this is another hoppy tongue bruiser from Sixpoint that has pretty good balance and a well hidden ABV. Also, it is notable to mention that at 8.99 a 4-pack, this one is a great value."

""
"A great beer."
"Can: Poured a deep hazy orangey color ale with large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of pine and resin notes with sweet malt base. Taste is a nice mix between some pine and resin hoppy notes with some solid malt backbone with quite a lot of sweetness. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done though I prefer My IIPA a bit more dry."
""
""
"O- a very nice dipa here, the abv is hidden at all but it packs some great flavor and the mouthfeel still makes this a very easy one to put down easily."
""
""
""
"Overall-- not bad, but not one I'll be picking up regularly."
"o: heard about the hype, thought I would give it a try, doesn't live up to hype, but worth buying again when I want a tasty double IPA, plus easy to pack in the cans to a backpack, with no glass hazards."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was full bodied with some slickness. Modest carbonation."
""
""
"O- Pretty good iipa, not the best I have had, but solid."
"o: I enjoyed this overall and would not mind having this again. However, at this time I cannot say this is a top IIPA. BUt with IPAs I feel like they are slightly different each time you have them, so again, I would like to revisit this sometime."
"O - I keep coming back to this beer. I don't know why, but it keeps me interested. I'm on about 5 4 packs in a month. That is a lot of just one beer for me. It must mean something."
""
""
""
"The clear copper and voluptuous off-white head were a fantastic surprise upon pouring this 12oz can. The nose is full of all the things I look for in hop heavy beers, from spices to grapefruit to (most important) pine. The taste follows suit, but with a considerable malt backing, with great bread and caramel flavors. Overall, this 103 IBU beer is quite balanced, and I'm a big fan. I liked other Sixpoint offerings, but this one blew me away."
""
"This one is good but I like more hops presence and bite in a 9% abv DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"overall, a good DIPA"
"I like this one, and am excited to try some of Sixpoint's other offerings, as they just started distributing to my area. This was my first Sixpoint'er and a great one to start. Reasonably priced too, I paid about $9 for 4 cans."
"Another treat from Dino! Price Stick still on, good deal!! Poured from can to pint glass the beer pours a amber gold with a decent 1 finger white cap with little retention and lacing. The nose is big and resiny like the name suggests More earthy pine than citrus but its a hop bomb. Hints of toasted caramel malts. Similarly the flavor is hoppy and bitter and aggressive. Earthy pine dominated with hints of citrus with an underlying caramel malt sweetness. Medium bodied the beer finishes crisp and clean with a lingering bitterness. Overall, good! At the price if this was more readily available I'd drink a lot of it, lol."
""
""
"O- Decent beer, nothing special, wouldn't trade for it again."
"O: Overall a really nice IIPA. The price point for what you are getting is really the huge selling point. The price on tap was incredible, and the can was decent as well."
"Taste is sweet upfront, a peek of citrus in the center, and ample piney bittnerness through the close, with a lingering alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good also, esp for the style. Leans more towards flavor than bitter for bitter's sake, which is fine by me."
"O: really enjoyed this brew and will absolutely be picking up more of it this summer for some out door adventures, id say it compares to torpedo in cans but not quite as tastey"
"a big rocky dirty white head rises three fingers tall and settles rather slowly leaving large clumps of lacing on the glass. resiny pine greets the nose with bready and caramel malts having its back. tastebuds are greeted with a full onslaught of thick oily resin hops. luckily the malts are well balanced in this beer to help soften the bitterness. there is also a herbal garden flavor on the backend. mouthfeel is medium body with an oily feel. carbonation is very well done. and the bitter end is short lived. overall this is a really good dipa, but for me i prefear more citrus than pine."
"O- I expected a little bit of a heftier beer here, but this is nice. Very piney with substantial bitterness and light citrus notes. Might not seek out, but wouldn't be opposed to trying again."
""
"A solid DIPA, good standby to have in the fridge, much like all of the canned offerings from Sixpoint."
""
""
""
"Hazy pale yellow. Forms a very large billowing off-white head that shows sme excellent retention and leaves a copious amount of lacing on the way down. Aroma is a mix of sweet malts, pine, citrus, and even a hint of the floral. Taste starts off surprisingly sweet. Orange and citrus. Very little pine or resin on the first few sips, but the resin becomes much more pronounced over the course of the beer until it becomes almost overpowering on the palate. Body is on the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation and a powerful, astringent bitterness. Overall, a very nice beer that develops nicely as you drink it."
""
"M: Plenty of hops and plenty of malts, but it doesn't get into barleywine territory (I retract my earlier remarks to the contrary). It's unusual but I think that that is the point."
""
"The drink ability for this style beer is absolutely amazing. Not as overpowering versus some of the other DIPAs. Its all what your in the mood for. $8 for the 4 pack, absolute value for this beer. I plan on getting more."
"O: A pretty decent DIPA. Not great, but far from bad."
"Pours a golden amber with a three finger fluffy white head with great retention. Quite a bit of beautiful lacing present as the head slowly subsides. A strong aroma of piney hops with undertones of fruity sweetness greets the nose. True to the name bold pine resin upfront, sweet malt in the middle, and the finish is piney and dry. Perfectly carbonated, with a strong malt backbone that lends to a medium-bodied brew, but one that doesn't interfere with the silky smoothness. A solid DIPA which would certainly be enjoyed by those that appreciate a drier finish."
""
"Thanks to tone77 for this one."
"Aroma hit me in the face all the way from the table top! Mmmm....hops! Very nice looking beer, with somewhat of an odd color for an IIPA. More toward red than pale. Very nice head and lacing that hung around for the entire glass. Flavor was initially bitterness than followed closely by a nice malt presence, not overdone. Very nice beginning! Lots of piney, citrusy, minty, hops in the middle with some malt """juice""" to back it up. Long dry, hoppy finish that had me dangerously cracking open another before company arrived."
""
"Overall a good DIPA. For the price..a really good DIPA!"
""
"This is one of those IIPA’s that they just threw a ton of hops in and cranked up the IBU’s. It is a good, reasonably priced IIPA."
"A great DIPA should maintain a level of drinkable and avoid being so heavy as to be a sipping beer. Sixpoint has done well to include enough malty sweetness to offset Resin's deluge of hop flavor and bitterness."
""
"Pretty good DIPA. Very nice pine hop notes and intense bitterness."
"Overall impression - It's never a good thing when the product description of a DIPA refers to """encroaching malt sweetness.""""

"Poured from the can into a nonic a clear copper color with a rather thin head that was gone quickly with only a trace of lace left behind.Sticky resinious hops like the name suggests dominates the nose along with some sweet alcohol and a hint of brown sugar.There is a definint hit of hops on the palate but they dont hit hard they seem to roll across the palate wich isn't bad but it's not full on like expected,mild caramel and more assertive alcohol sweetness creeps.The sweetness isn't to big like to many of the style but the hops could pack a little more puch,I love Sixpoint but this I only kinda liked."
"The scary part is that its drinkable. Way too drinkable for the ABV. I would buy this if it was in NC."
""
"Verdict: Rock solid DIPA from Sixpoint and so far, my favorite offering. The flavors are dank yet juicy with a nice resinous aroma. It’s a bit too dry and leaves a bit of a cottonmouth feeling but it’s definitely worth checking out if you can get it."
""
"Overall this is a good IPA out of a can. Would buy again for the convenience of the can and the good taste of the IPA."
""
" What a great beer. This is an east coast Pliny and I will put it up against any IIPA out there. One of my desert island beers at this point as it is super drinkable and extreme at once. This is an exceptional beer."
""
""
"O- This one is very easy to drink and will sneak up on you for sure. A great brew for sure."
"Overall: Pretty good overall, and the price point isn't awful for what you get out of it. I do wish the smell was more robust, though, as it's such an important part of these bigger beers in brining out the intensity of the flavors. I will be more than happy to drink my remaining three."
"o - overall, not your classic iipa, but not bad. if you are looking for a hop explosion, this brew doesn't have it, but if you are not a huge hophead, this is the iipa you've been waiting for. good beer, but for the iipa world, it is decent and doesn't hang with the big boys."

"EDIT: Just had a can dated BB Nov. 23rd, 2012, and it was significantly better. Definitely a B+. Hopefully I can get something straight off the line and re-review."

"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, light orange citrus and dry hops. In the taste, sticky orange citrus to a mellow pine hop, a small alcohol presence in the end. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry hop with small citrus and a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. A bit dry, mellow hops, a bit boozy, and just about average."
""
""
"Overall, good hop flavor and a decent bitterness for the style. Malt doesn't overtake the flavor as with some dipas. Wish the aroma showed more character."

"Pours a chilled but clear golden copper with finger of white foam head that fades quickly to a thin film and light lace. Biscuit malt and pine hop nose, slightly sweet and caramel like. Sweet and bready body with a light rye like spice and resiny citrus and pine bitterness in the finish. Medium thick and lightly carbonated body, slightly watery and thin. Finish is spicy, cardboard and pine bitterness. Not very appealing."
""
""
""
"O: Good Double IPA, very drinkable, and sorry to repeat myself, but nicely balanced"
"This is an interesting offer from Sixpoint. I think I would much rather have a Bengali Tiger in the future. It is head and shoulders over this brew."
"Overall, a solid offering from Sixpoint. Would totally buy again, and in bulk quantity. Awesome nose, drinkability, dry-hop character, and packaging. 4.0"
""
"Found it rather smooth drinking. Would have again."
"Only thing double about this IPA is the abv. If you're looking for big hop flavor and bitterness, look elsewhere. Don't waste your money."
""
"Overall I expected this beer to be a hop punch in the mouth but ended up getting a sweet level of bittering hops with a high octane ABV. If I find a four pack I will get it again but a 3 dollar single was worth it."
""
"It's not bad, but given the price per ounce, I was hoping for more. It delivers neither a crazy aromatic IPA nor a nice and sticky imperial ale. I'll skip this one in the future."
"O- Very impressed by this DIPA, this is on of my first beers from 6point, i will most likely seek out others. But this is just great, no alcohol detected at all truly a beast of a DIPA."
""
"One finger off white head, slow dissipation with good lacing. Orange pine in the nose, some caramel. Big hop taste upfront, mild pine resin in the middle back end medium resin, creeper, mediium effervecence. Decent residual sweetness, a bit sticky yet dry. OK for East Coast DIPA, but not in the same league as Tankslapper."
""
""
"The mouthfeel feels a little heavy for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer, but not a real outstanding one of the style for me. The hoppiness just didn't really stand out to me directly compared to other highly regarded versions of the style. It did feel relatively balanced and drinkable though for the style, especially for the abv."
"O: Really enjoyed this DIPA from Sixpoint. This is my first from them as they arent available in Michigan. Very impressed and looking forward to if they enter the Chicago market. Might make it a little easier to get my hands on during trips."
"O: A good tasting brew, very unique, definitely enjoyed my 4-pack."
""
""
"Interesting tall, skinny can, a bit unnervingly like an energy drink. Pour was a slightly hazy caramel amber with a thin, whispy head. Up front - hops. Middle - hops. Finish - you guessed it - hops. Malt was barely hanging in there, shouting over the din of hops bitterness to be heard, and at that just a squeak of caramel malt. Despite the name, I did not get a good deal of resin character in the hops. While not overpowering, hopping was forceful, with a blunt dry hopped nature that was interestingly consistent from start to finish."
"O: I enjoy this more than most double IPAs, but the clash gets to be too much for me."
"O: A very good offering in the DIPA category, if not top of the class. It's everything one should expect of the varietal, with nothing too new to add. For a beer of 9.1% abv, I couldn't taste the hooch, though I still wouldn't call it """sessionable""" because of the amount of flavors and dry bite."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is rather drinkable for the style because the alcohol is relatively well masked from the taste and there isn’t an overpowering amount of bitterness. It’s a nice beer to try if you are looking for a change of pace from grapefruit hops."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. For a 9% brew it is fairly approachable. I like the resinous cling and decent contrast of maltiness to hops here. It seemingly was more crisp than you would expect for a brew of this strength. However, the mineral inclusion I could deal without. I like my hoppy brews with a bit of residual sweetness and this one had that. However, this one was primarily driven by some dank herbal hoppiness that completely overtook the brew and it almost became dull half way through the glass. A decent effort and worth seeking out to give a try but not something I would return to time and time again."
""
"I really hope this is a year round brew as I could see this as a go to beer."

"Notes: Sorry, could be a bad can, a bad day… A bad brew? My apologies but this is going nowhere. I will sure try another can, and re-review accordingly should it prove that this was an off one..."
"It’s ok, but I didn’t enjoy as much as I would have imagined."
""
"Fruity grapefruit notes in the smell. The head is tan and laces beautifully over the amber body. Taste is sweet, quickly fades and snaps into bitterness. Sticks to your teeth. Soft and sexy brew, a sex pistol. Would pay more. Purchased four pack from craft beer store. Attempt ageing?"
""
"O: Overall, on-tap was better. This is still a top-notch imperial IPA, especially for one in a can. Not close to Heady Topper, but a nice second that I would never turn down. Glad I have 3 more of these bad boys."
""
"Mouthfeel is sharp with lots of carbonation, and it has a very sticky feeling left behind. With the high ABV and sticky finish, this isn't overly drinkable, but is pretty tasty. Overall, a very good brew, but it doesn't blow me away."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty average DIPA. I like my DIPAs drier and more aromatic. Maybe they should rename this beer """Melanoidin.""" Decent beer with no glaring problems, but too malty."
"Cool packaging, not so great beer inside. I picked this beer up from the local liquor store and it was a recent shipment, so I assume the beer was relatively fresh. Kind of unbalanced, overly bitter, and not very drinkable."
"Overall, it's a good, but not overly impressive DIPA. I like what they've done here, Resin is definitely the right name for this one. Glad I have a 4-pack to try this again, but there are quite a few other DIPAs I'd prefer."
""
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, and while it is monstrous in flavor, it's surprisingly accessible at the same time, coming across as more delicious than buzzy, fruity, or bitter. In other words, everything works well together in harmony, making this an excellent brew. Very much worth trying."
"From the can into a snifter pours a pale orange amber under a chunky foam head. Cool and somewhat shy notes of salty pine seem to peak out most in relatively subtle yet fragrant flowery hop aroma. Perhaps a little bit of orange citrus in there somewhere as well. A slow motion punch of favorably acidic tangerine citrus flavor ascends into a luscious garden of hop resin that imprints itself on the palate long after the finish. Very nice, Sixpoint..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special. Purchased at a specialty store with the likes of Old Raspy, and as such, expected something great. A solid DIPA but not something I'd buy over most others."
"Overall a sipping beer that is worth a shot. I like the packaging and approach on a style with a fairly saturated market. Going to try more from this brewery."
""
""
""
"O- A well done, precise and refreshing DIPA. Cant go wrong here but it wont blow your socks off."
"Pours a murky dark orange with a 2 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest and herbal hops with some subtle malt aromas. Taste is also of citrus zest and subtle herbal hops with some brown sugar and malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA but it's funny to see this one in a thin can."
"Overall: I hate the packaging, but I love the beer. Not sure why the nose isn't bigger, but this beer is great overall."
""
"D ~ For hopheads only. Big ups to Crabbicus! Thanks!"
""
""
"O: One of the better offerings from Sixpoint to date. If you like your pores to ooze humulus lupulus, give this bad boy a whirl."
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. I prefer their Bengali Tiger to this but still nice and has a load of pine hops in the nose. Worth having, would have it again."
""
"Medium to full bodied with great carbonation, this beer is amazingly drinkable considering its 9.1% ABV. The body is thick and sticky, which allows all the flavors to properly present themselves and make an impression. The carbonation is good and fizzy, helping to cut the stickiness of the body and increase the carbonation. The swallow is good and crisp but leads to a dry finish."
"Good beer and good drinkability for such a strong DIPA, but this is not a session beer for me. While it was very tasty, it’s a real palate attack so to me this is one to enjoy with some food. Definitely worth checking out."
""
"A superior and overlooked DIPA, one of the better ones brewed on the east coast."
""
""
"O - Good DIPA, resinous just like the name suggests. Not sure what it is, but has similar characteristics in mouthfeel and taste to other Sixpoint beers."
"Mouthfeel is a bit off-putting as it is somewhat low on carbonation and almost tastes flat. I have no real problem with this, it doesn't affect the flavor in a negative way, but it's just not expected. It has a full body, and the puckering bitterness quickly fades to a sweet finish. Moderate drinkability."
""
"I'm impressed with this one. A nice big east coast ipa that taste like it is from the northwest."
"O - All in all, this was very enjoyable! This might not be the best Double IPA of all time, but in my opinion, this is exactly what the brewers wanted it to be: a resinous, bold, flavourful beer, with enough hops to satisfy a hardcore hophead and a high, almost dangerous drinkability. I'd recommend it!"
"O - I thought this one was decent. The hops and booze really started to take over as it sat in the glass, leaving me with about half a glass of beer that was kinda tough to finish. I will have to try a can some day and see if that is better."
"I didn’t really care for this. It’s balanced enough up front but get’s way too pushy with the hops in the backend of the profile, which ultimately leaves this warm, sticky, and bitter with an overall feel that just sits a little too heavy in the nose and mouth. This is yet another disappointing canned offering from Sixpoint."
"This beer puts its arm around my palate, being a pal and all then slams it a few times just to keep it in check, sip after sip this happens and I keep on going back for more. The sweetness underneath lures me in and a bushel of hops smacking me in the face is my reward."
"Drink- Just okay. Lots I wouldve changed but not my beer. Now I know to stick with Bengali"
"O- Not bad just misses being something above average. The hops seem to be a bit one note. On the bright side I think the brewer suceeded in making a very resinous pine aroma / flavored beer."
"Pours transparent orange with white head that dissipates. Aroma of grass, mango, cotton candy, energy drink. Intense flavors of citrus, slight mango, hop resin, grass, orange rind, booze and bitterness take over in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A cotton candy hop overload with no direction."

"It's a sticky mouthfeel, being gloriously hopped, but with an underlying backbone of big malts as well, lurking beneath the palate-shocking hops. Definitely one for the hardcore hop-heads here. Solid, and a good experience, for sure."

"O- Good beer, definitely will pick it up again. Best beer I have had from Sixpoint."
"Beer pours a dark, almost amber color with about a two finger head. One of the darkest IPA's I've seen. Lacing is pretty thin. The smell on this is pretty muted, although what's there leans towards the malty side of things. No pine, no citrus, and no hops if any. The only real let down in the beer. The taste is so balanced. Perhaps one of the MOST balanced I've had. None of the hops, malt, or pine stick out more than the other. Instead, they all come together in a harmony rarely seen in a beer, much less an IPA. This is a clean beer that I could easily put away several of. Which leads us to, the mouthfeel. Very clean and crisp again. There's a decent amount of bitterness here, with the hops finally making an appearance. This is the latest in a beer I've ever seen hops take prominence. It's very unique. The taste doesn't linger too long, but there's a little bit of a citrus tinge left at the end too. Another first. Overall, this is a fabulous beer. The 9%+ ABV isn't noticeable even a little, making this a dangerous little number. Hats off to Sixpoint. I'd all but written you off. This beer makes me believe again."

"Dark reddish brown, spiderweb-like lacing and moderate retention. Sweet, malty and resinous in the nose. Pine and some citrus, tons of hop oils. Rich maltiness as well makes me think of this as somewhat of a cross between an English and American Imperial IPA. Bitter pine, some leafy hops, caramel and juicy, resinous hop notes. Full bodies, substantial bitterness balanced with a vast amount of malt. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I was excited to try this one after watching the Sixpoint video for it. It's definitely above average, but not on the level of HT, Pliny, Hopslam, or even Double Trouble for that matter. Still, I think that Sixpoint achieved what they set out to brew with this one. Very nice."
"This beer exhibits incredible balance of malt and hops."
""
""
"On the whole, a decent double IPA. For all the supposed hype surrounding this brew, it's a decidedly solid but unspectacular example of the style. I've sampled better, but I could always do worse than this, especially with other canned beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's smooth and not in any way harsh. A slight sweetness goes with not over the top but not wimpy hops. By the way, it's strong but you don't taste it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly drinkable, but high in ABV, so you won’t be smashing these (hopefully). A little bit of a “stingy” feel to it. A good beer but not a great one, at least for me. The taste, as it has been with most of my brief experience with Sixpoint’s brews, is balanced and “classical”. Solid, for sure, but not much more than that for me. 3.5/5"
"M - Medium to full body with a good sludgy mouthfeel. Lots of tongue-coating hop oils. A remarkable mouth feel."

"O - This is a solid refreshing BIG beer tat can stand up to paring with very savory and spicy foods. Can't wait till the summer to down a couple of these at the beach. Yes, since it is in a can you can take it to the beach. Gotta like that!"
"M: Medium bodied, malt bulked DIPA."
"Ok, so the beer doesn't exactly change my life, but it's a very rewarding session that allows the beer to grow slowly while allowing my palate to adjust with each sip. With a beer style where complexity might be limited, this strong IPA continues to develop as the beer takes it's procession from nose, to the front of the tongue, across the middle of the palate and deep into the throat in finish. Yet, it leaves me wanting more somehow; more brightness, more boldness, more bitterness? The beer's minor faults might just lie in its finesse and grace."
""
"Overall - This is a pretty big beer, the hops are strong, amd dominate. The malts work well with the hops to add sweetness to the bitterness. There is a warm alcohol presence in each drink. This is unique, tasty and hoppy as hell. Excellent beer, and as im finding out with all sixpoint beers, hasa nice twist to set it apart from the rest. Worth a drink, espically for hopheads."
""
""
""
"This is a fine DIPA, but nothing to go nuts over. There's alot I like about it, especially the nose, but the maltiness is there in the flavors, plus the booze. Good, but not great or outstanding."
""
"O- Really a fantastic beer. Rich, full malt character, resinous, piney hops, and colorful yeast combine to make a mouth-watering brew that is hard to switch away from."
""
"O - This brew is straight to the point. Quite good; probably exceeds expectations. A different take on a DIPA. Full of flavor, and an East Coast beast to be reckoned with."
" The taste is good with some nice malt flavor but does have a lot of body to go along with that. I enjoy the hop flavors and some slight sweetness combines with the mild pine for an interesting taste of herbal and slight fruity note which is lightly astringent too. The alcohol is there but I was really shocked when I read the abv here because it doesn't have much of that in the taste really at all. I enjoyed this but it is not your normal double, very balanced with malt and comes off more like a strong ale since it is not as hop forward, but I did enjoy it for what it is so Kudos to Sixpoint for that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sixpoint doesn't really """brew to style.""" This beer is definitely a IIPA but it has its own little spin on the style. Not overtly dry, not overtly bitter, completely full of flavor. In a world of Pliny the Elder wanna be's, Resin is definitely unique. Well done sixpoint."
"O: I love a beer that doesn’t mess around, and this one most assuredly fits the bill. I’ll admit I was tentative, not knowing what to expect, but this one knocked it out of the park. A three-run jack from Albert Pujols is how I’d describe it. I just wish that Boston Market would have allowed me to sneak this one in with the brisket; if I were crafty, I probably could have gotten away with it."
"O- By far the best I've had from Sixpoint. A really well done IIPA in the W.C. tradition. I can't wait to get some more of this one. I'm certainly gonna put a couple away and see what happens."
""
""
""
"This is a well crafted, weighty DIPA. With that being said, for me, this was nothing special. It's straightforward and the metallic bite it carries threw me off a bit. I've never had a bias towards beer in a can. In fact, I've really enjoyed several other offerings from Sixpoint. But for this one in particular, its packaging only retracts from the beer. The thought of it being oxidized crossed my mind but the staff at Premier said this can was part of a new shipment. In the end, I'd say it's worth a shot but don't expect it to blow your socks off."

"I won't seek out another."

"Sixpoint Resin is a really fantastic DIPA, every time i try a sixpoint im always expecting great quiality brews and they have yet to disappoint especially with Resin!! It is a very drinkable DIPA pours a nice tanish color with a decent head with hints of grapfruit and citris and a very low trace of the alcohol with it being over 9%. i highly recommend trying this if you can find it!!"
"O - I had heard mixed things about this one, so I'm glad I finally got to have some...the 10 ounce draft I had was just enough for me...it tried being balanced but I think the caramel got in the way...I'd rather have sweet, juicy hops rather than that bitter pine resin"
"O - An impressive DIPA from a brewery I'm enjoying more and more. Bonus points to the cool can design!"
"O- Impressive, this is something that could be enjoyed by hopheads around the world!"
""
"O: A can of hops if I’ve ever had one. I could see myself buying four of these and having a hell of a time at a pool party, beach, or otherwise."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this one. I love piney hoppy beers and this one delivers. One of the better IPAs I have had in a while and I think that is because the burnt caramel taste goes so well with the piney hops. Potent but I am glad I got a four pack--Up with Righteous and Diesel as some of my favorites from the brewery."
"Solid Double IPA at a pretty impressive price. I hope they keep this thing fresh and don't flood the shelve with it because it would be a great four pack to fill my hop needs once in a while."
"O-a decent decidedly different DIPA"
"Overall - If you're looking for a good imperial IPA to try, look elsewhere. This beer is decent, but it tastes nothing like a DIPA (more along the lines of an amber as I mentioned). I have no idea who determined the IBUs, but I highly doubt that 103 is correct. The appearance, aroma, and taste all seem to point away from the IPA realm. Lastly, this beer is insanely UNdrinkable at 9.1% abv...you can have one or two of these and call it a night or have a 6-pk of an actual amber ale at 5-6% abv."
"If you like a hop explosion heavy on the bitter herb and pine resin and a dry finish this might be your ale. Needs to be enjoyed at some point next to Hopsickle and fresh 120 just to see which is most over the top for its ABV."
""
""
"This is a real gem of a beer. I can't believe I only bought a single can. I will seek out more of this ASAP."
""
"Notes: It's nice and hoppy but I like the bit of dryness and malt in it as well. Cheers"
"An excellent DIPA, and certainly the second best I've had from the can (next to thge Alchemist). I highly recommend this, expecially warmed; I let it sit out for almost an hour before pouring, letting it get to about 50 degrees or so. At this temp the flavors exploded and the aroma was very present. Grab and drink this if you can find it!"
"I found the real flaw to this beer not to be a lack of hops for a DIPA--though that is the case--but really just the sweetness and the off-notes. It's a shame, because I've really enjoyed some of their hoppy beers on tap and on cask before."
"O- Good dipa, but was hoping for more. The spices and amber color is a little off for the style."
"Overall a beer that I don't care to have on a regular basis if ever again, who should I give my last can away to? I only bought two 12 ounces I will stick with my pounders of Bengali Tiger and Righteous Ale instead."
""
""
"Overall this is a good DIPA. I'd buy it again, but I'm a bit of a homer."
"O: Good stuff. Again, not what I look for in a DIPA (I like an overall """lighter""" profile), but if you like hops, this is good stuff."
"This beer just arrived in Indianapolis today. It pours a lighter bodied dark amber/auburn in color with a soapy lacing around the glass. The hose is both sweet and piney. It features a lot of caramel malt, moderate pine, slight onion and toffee. It's very malt heavy and a little sweet for my liking and as always, I'm not a fan of the onion. The flavors begin very sweet and malty before turning very bitter and dry. The bitterness follows into the aftertaste and lingers a tad too long. It's just ok. It drinks light yet sticky and does have a good amount of residual sugar. Overall this is a pretty average DIPA and not one I'd buy again."
""
""
"Overall a good brew."
"edit: had on tap as well - thought can was a bit better."
""
"This is an interesting DIPA. It's not my favorite example of the stye, and I don't think it's going to challenge Pliny and Heady for the top spots, but I'm glad I was able to get a pair of cans. The 103 IBU's are nothing to laugh about. Resin is recommended to any hop head."
""
"Can to pint. Looks decent; like an amber IPA with nice head that fades fairly quickly. I love head... Smells very average for 103 IBU's - not what I expected. Tastes good; the hoppiness is definitely present here. Mouthfeel is good too. Overall, a good beer that's score was brought down by the least important factors - but they're still factors."
""
""
"O: Interesting style, or hybrid rather. Could have done without."
"O: A decent DIPA, probably would pass in the future, but worth a shot."
""
"O - I really enjoyed this brew. It reminds me of a cross between Sierra Nevada's Northern Hemisphere and Ghidorah/Beer Camp #29 DIPA. I'm a fan of the big pine, big bitter, big malt style and this brew does it well."
"Pours a dark copper with a huge, long lasting off-white head. Exceptional lacing. Aroma of fresh pine sap off the bat as you crack the can, secondary notes of grapefruit as well. Like almost all Sixpoint beers I've had, a very unique brew. Toasty and sweet biscuit notes to start before a total resin takeover. Big pine notes, not huge on the bitterness, but extremely resinous. Very dry and long lasting as well. Slightest touch of grapefruit hops mixed in at the dry sticky pine finish. Nice bite to this one and great highlight of the pine resin without the extreme bitterness that usually accompanies it."
"Pretty good beer overall, though a bit too malty and not enough hop flavor or aroma for me. Instead, it focuses on bitterness. I'm all for that, but it works much better when combined with other hop qualities."
"A dance of pine, fresh hops, and malty backbone. Pretty well balanced, with the 9.1% abv masked well. Lingering pine and bitter hops in the finish. The beer coats the palate, but still goes down easily. Overall, a solid beer that I would certainly have again."
"Drinkability/overall- overall i did very much enjoy this beer and will be a future go to Double IPA for me, great balance and big flavor, first had on tap in the city and was just as good in the can, well worth seeking out very enjoyable from a brewery i am gaining appreciation for"
"Very highly recommended!"
"Overall this was a great deal and an outstanding way to spend $2.50."

"A-4.5 S-4 T-4.5 M-4.5 O-4.5"
"i was really looking forward to this release as ive enjoyed most other sixpoint beers ive had, but this was a bit of a letdown, exspecially with all the other great examples of the style out there. prolly wont be buying more of this, but the rest of the four pack will be an easy kill. this almost comes off as an imperial english IPA with all the buttery, biscuity malt and slight leafy herbal hops. also, this doesnt have any of the usual signature phenolic yeast profile that is sixpoint."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark auburn color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of piney hops. Taste is dominated by hops, piney, some citrus, a touch of alcohol, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while not a bad beer, I felt it lacked balance and was to hop forward."
""
""
""
"D - This beer is kick ass. For all the DIPA's that taste so much the same, this one tastes a little bit different and it's better for it. I'll be getting this one again. Very creative, very visionary. Touche. I had never encountered Sixpoint until a few months ago and I've LOVED every offering from them. I can't talk them up enough. Also, the slender, taller Resin can is pretty sexy haha. The marketing definitely works on me."
"PS - Ok, I mixed them. A 1:1.5 ratio of Pumking to Resin is pretty good, but not mind blowing. Enjoy."
"I do find the can annoying though. Too tall and slender. Girly-like."
""
"Great mouthfeel here, with softer carbonation. Some warmth from alcohol, but not overwhelming. A very well made beer."
""
"O - Not bad, based on the name I was expecting a resinous wall of hop flavor and aroma and it fell way short, more caramel flavor than I expected."
""
"Overall, this is a great new edition to the sixpoint lineup. It a great DIPA and really great caliber beer for a regular lineup and especially for the price."
"An unique DIPA. Pine and resin flavor but without the crushing bitterness. Not the most flavorful DIPA but drinks very well."
"Overall (4.0): This is a relatively unique DIPA, in my opinion. It chases one part of the bitterness spectrum that nobody I’ve seen has really pursued quite this far, so I respect Sixpoint (and their new brewer, Jan) for that. I’d probably buy this again. Still, it doesn’t really hold a candle to Gemini. Sixpoint, listen to me when I say this: I don’t care if you have to put a different name on it or design some ridiculous can nobody’s ever heard of before, just please—PLEASE—put Gemini in a can. This is nice, but you’ve already got a world-class DIPA in your arsenal. I suggest you load the aluminum cannons. (Get it?)"
"O- It's good, but I like other doubles much more. Certainly wouldn't turn it down, but when it comes to Sixpoint, I'll stick with Bengali Tiger"
""
"D - It's quite remarkable how quaffable this 9.1% ABV 103 IBU offering really is... I could actually enjoy a couple of these in a sitting... Another job very well done by Sixpoint... The 12oz tallboy can is also a nice touch..."
"Compares nicely with Oskar Blues Gordon's Beer. I give extra point because it's east coast, and for the cute 12 oz tall boy can"
"Overall if you're a fan of ipas or dipas and haven't tried this I'd definitely recommend it. Lives up to its name, packs a punch in flavor and alcohol, pretty intense."
""
"O - Overall I liked this beer from Sixpoint, as I do most of their brews. Really drinkable IPA, almost dangerously so. Tasty beer."
"This is a tasty, well balanced beer that's surprisingly drinkable for 9% abv. I wouldn't call it a hop bomb, but it's not for the faint of heart either."
""
""
""
""
"O: HOP BOMB! You can really taste the IBUs and yet it is pretty well balanced. How does it compare to Hopslam? Lets be honest, it doesn't. Overall it's still an excellent DIPA (or Imperial Red) and the best offering I've had from Sixpoint thus far."
"Definitely worth the wait for this big beer in a 12 ounce can. I thought eh, this is okay with the first sip but as I continued to indulge it just transformed into this great sweet bitter, beautiful smooth beer. I wonder how smooth this could feel on tap."
"This beer seems a little strange when chilled, but allowed to warm to closer to room temperature, it makes a nice sipping beer for a long winter's evening. It is more like a fresh-hopped barleywine than an IPA."
"12oz can. Pours a translucent dark brown with orange hues and a thin layer of head. Tons of sticky lacing. Aromas of piney hops along with some mango, orange and pineapple. Taste is bitter pine hops along with some sweet malts. Piney, floral and spicy at the end. Dry, resinous finish. Very dry and chewy mouthfeel. This reminds me a bit of Bengali Tiger, but its not just a hopped up version of it. This is definitely its own beer. Overall, its a pretty good Double IPA and worth seeking out."
""
""
"Beer is pretty heavy, chewy with hops, strongly bitter on the backend, very strong flavors, strong throughout, a little alcohol up front, a very in my face beer all around, this is a little malty but forgivable, a really nice big IPA here. I'm looking forward to another one, but that means I'm going to have to hold one of those annoying cans again. I have some serious thinking to do."
""
"O - I like it a lot and I'm glad it's a local beer that I can get fresh."
"O - I got some tongue-grating bitterness and grapefruit-mango juice flavor. The nose was extraordinary - when the toxic funes weren't torching my nostrils. A little more restrained on the ABV, and tighter body would accentuate those awesome hop qualities than overwhelm them."
"Overall Impression- As my first brew by SixPoint, very impressed! Will be looking for more of they beer. This one hit home with the use of fruit and mango. Enjoyed greatly and HIGHLY recommend this one! Rivals many of the big time 2X IPA's I've enjoyed lately!"
""
"O: The first can I had of this, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't just a pale resinous hop bomb. But I've come to really enjoy how balanced it is. The heavy malt bill helps to beat down the pine needle bitterness, and it adds a great amount of depth to the beer. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"This is quite unique. I can see hop lovers enjoying this as well """balanced""" IPA enthusiasts. I prefer a straight up hop bomb in the vein of Pliny the Elder, but this is great too. 4"
""
"Notes: This is one of the first readily available canned DIPAs I've come across, and it's good to boot. Easy to take on-the-go. I think it will sell well. Totally unrelated, but there's something about these slender 'red bull' type cans that just makes me want to pound these. I can't yet figure out why."

""
"Cheers!"

"Wow. By far the best Sixpoint beer I've ever had. Lots of complex flavors and intense hoppiness perfect for my taste. Thanks so much to GuisseppeFranco for the can!"
"Cracking the CAN, Resin pours out pretty thick. The liquid is a dark amberish red and does not look like your normal double. A firm even half an inch of dark tannish/light brown foam that has ok retention and leaves some spots on the glass. A bit of haze to the liquid. Smell is assertively dry hopped with some piney scent that is pungent. Some grain and grass comes up with a big caramel malt build. Just as sweet smelling as it is hoppy. Take a whiff, it's big. Alcohol is present in the nose as well. Taste is very big, very hoppy, very malty and very big. Piney dank resinous hop blast that builds into a sweet taste in the middle followed by a shot of hot alcohol. Insanely bitter. Earthy and piney hoppings, not tropical like most. East coast for sure. This has the makings to go a year and become one of those old hoppy barleywines that I've heard of. The body is there. This is over medium in build with a dare I say it resinous body. syrupy in a way and a bit hot. The alcohol is tasted and felt on the mouth. not a good look."
"O- good beer overall smell taste and mouthfeel were very drinkable"
"Pours a deep yet clear orange hue with a nice frothy off white head. huge citric and grapefruit hop nose. smells delicious. big oily hop mouth feel. huge hop forward taste. lacing is excellent. huge oily citric and grapefruit taste with some other tropical fruits thrown in. bitterness is huge. drinks like bengali's bigger citric brother.alcohol isn't detected at all.overall though pretty standard but with the unique hop resinous mouthfeel.good though."
""
"Overall a real fun enjoyable ride, much better than what I had on tap."
"12oz. can served in a tulip. Pours a hazy brownish-amber with a frothy, cream-colored head that eventually settles into an off-white slick. Some swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose begins with a significant piny, resinous hops presence followed by floral notes and finishing with citrus aromas. Taste is somewhat consistent with the nose; however, there is a strange spiciness embedded in the flavor profile that reminds me a bit of Asian cuisine - soy sauce, brown sugar and perhaps tarragon. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an oily texture and an even carbonation that falls just short of lively. Overall, I generally like this beer; however, the strange spicy flavors gets to be a bit much. Not a beer that I could drink more than one of in a sitting."
"Really good fresh hops with a good supporting malt backbone."

"Hazy deep copper colour, one finger of off white head, light lace left behind. Smell is a mixture of malt and hop all at once, some sweeter malty notes come first but still very hoppy, lots of pine and to a lesser extent citrus, some lightly harsh alcohol scents are fairly present at points as well, more grapefruit comes out as it warms. Taste is quite hoppy and while this is a total hop bomb there is still a generous malt presence that gives a little sweetness as well, citrus, pineapple, hoppy pine flavours as well, some alcohol at first but subsides quickly. Sticky and oily body, syrupy thickness at points, light-med carb, medium body. Pretty good and quite fresh, have had better DIPA but this was still serviceable."
""
"Go get some of this high quality brew and enjoy."
""

"Bottom Line: The CAN version scratches an itch while the draught version only makes me want to scratch harder."
"O- I'm a bit torn about this beer. The taste and mouthfeel are nice, but not good enough to make up for what it lacks in the nose. It's definitely resinous, so if you like sticky DIPAs it may be worth seeking out."
"It's certainly full of resin. Unfortunately, I don't like it that much. There's no balance."
""
""
""
"mehhhh. I enjoy it. but, It's not exciting, not quite resiny, not quite hop-forward, yet not quite balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This one is a sipper that is for sure and it couldn't have been given a more appropriate name. Resin is sticky and intense and leaves your mouth coated with a bitter, hoppiness."
"Me like. Sixpoint kind of lost me can-wise with Autumnation, but between Resin and Deisel, like their Brooklyn home borough, they go HARD."
"Amber colored, good head. Smells very hoppy, citrusy and it forebodes the full frontal hop assault that hits your tongue. Goes down smooth, despite the rip-roaring bitterness."

"Overall: It just it the shelves around me this week and boy am I happy about that. I picked up a 4 pack earlier this week and loved every sip. I went back two days later and picked up a case. I just hope it stays readily available, for the overall taste and the price is super fair in my opinion. Great Job Six Point.... Again!"
"Medium-bodied feel with thin carbonation. Drinks almost like a thin syrup. Decent IPA overall. I think I much prefer the Sixpoint's Bengali Tiger over this however. Worth a try."
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
""
"Overall: Drinks pretty damn good and tastes alright, but it is quite inoffensive. Too malty and not hoppy-bitter enough to be the kind of aggressive Double IPA I like. At this price ($10 for 4 cans), I will not buy again."
""
"pours a dark sap amber color with a tan head that holds and leaves great lace. nose is pine sap and sweet mango on top of a sweet, dark caramel and toasty malt backbone. great balance in the taste. malt does a fine job amplifying the hoppy notes. sweet at first, but the hops balance, bitter and even seem to add a touch of drying character. medium full body that has pleasant heat in the long finish. great first effort from sixpoint's new lead brewer."
"O: Love the fact that the can is like the large Red Bull can - something a little different than the normal can forma factor. Nice complexity in the smell and taste of the beer - not overly bitter so pretty easy to drink. Perfectly named with the piney aromas/flavors and the sticky mouthfeel."
"O- damn good, and affordable, DIPA. Love the skinny tallboys too."
" not surprisingly after seeing it, its quite malty as well as being hoppy and bitter - a bit astringent but still very good. Has a few fruity mango/pineapple favors that are amazing but a little subtle. Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a dry finish. Really good brew."
""
"Resin pours a crystal clear deep red, with some cherry highlights. Two fingers of cream colored foam swirl together atop the beer, before slowing creeping downwards.The lacing left behind is very nice, nearly sheetlike. There is definitely a bit of caramel in the nose, but overall the aroma reeks of dank pine hops, with a slight herbal edge. The caramel base is a bit more prominent in the flavor profile, before an aggressive bitter bite makes itself known. The pine and almost minty herb hop finish is potent, but the effect is just a little too blunted for my taste by the prodigious (for the style) caramel backbone. The body here is a little too full for my taste, I prefer my double IPAs to be a little more dried out. The carbonation, while not bad, could also stand to be a little more active. Resin's not a bad beer by any stretch, and I always appreciate a hop bomb that does something outside of the usual citrus/grapefruit, but Sixpoint's got a beer here that is shaded a little bit too much towards imperial amber to be considered a great DIPA."
"Overall: It's an imperialized Bengali Tiger. The hop profile is similar, but they beefed up the malts enough to cover up some of the weaker hop elements. Decent, but the reduced can size seems silly. There's a 16oz can waiting to happen."
"Sticky mouthfeel, I like that. A lot of hop bitterness, grapefruit, resin. A little caramel, but definitely not cloyingly sweet like some dipas. It's a unique take, and I'm biased toward bright, citrusy highs. Smooth drinking, but the bitter resin really hits you at the finish. Pass the can, man."
"overall this beer is very deceptive considering its drinkability, very nice"

"O- a very solid dipa that is impressively well rounded, and very drinkable."
"This one was poured out of what looked like an energy drink can. The beer was golden in color with a creamy looking white head on top. The smell of the beer was really nicely hopped with some floral citrusy aromas. The taste was smooth but highly hoppy in flavor. The mouthfeel was more like a session ale which was surprising to me since it's 9%. Overall this was a good brew in my opinion. Worth trying again I think."

"O: Very resinous as I've mentioned about 10 times so far. Never had a beer that is resinous to this extent. It's not just a gimmick beer where the resin is completely overpowering and disgusting though. Actually quite a decent DIPA."
