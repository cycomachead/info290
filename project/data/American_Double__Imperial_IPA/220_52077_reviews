"Pretty standard IPA fare. Which is to say good but it doesn't stand out. Gold-amber, leans toward red. Decent head but it faded fast."

"Every Lagunitas beer tastes the same. Cookie cutter ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe the only Imperial IPA I want nothing to do with. And one of two hoppy beers from Lagunitas that I didn't enjoy."
""
"This beer walks a fine line on being too sweet and undrinkable.  It doesn't get there but I much rather have the regular version of this beer or the Sucks!  The malt is a bit too beefy and sweet.  I figure it is the bigger wheat malt bill."

"My favorite of the little sumpin line"

"O: not as good as I had hoped given how much I normally like lagunitas"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"boozier taste than anticipated...and that is a good thing to me"
""
""
"Light hop taste with citrus notes. Not too interesting"
""
"Strong grapefruit aroma hits your nose as soon as you open the bottle.  That follows with a strong grapefruit and hops flavor up front with a good dry bitter finish.  Another excellent beer from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
"Draft, so maybe it was older.  But not enough hop flavor for a DIPA"
""
""
""
""

"Can't wait for next release.  Top five beers period."

"Big fan of Lagunitas, and this brew is perfect for those nights when you both want to enjoy a good beer, and get the courage to talk to that cute girl."
""
""
"Pours a golden-honey in color with a good 1-finger foamy white head. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of malts, red grapefruit and pine. More going on with the taste as you can taste the pale malts, floral and earthy hops along with some citrus zest. Has a good taste with a slight bitter finish but really doesn't last a long time. Medium-bodied and carbonation. Wasn't sure on this one but turned out ok overall."

"Another solid Lagunitas beer in the LS family. Worth checking out."

"Sumpin' Sumpin' has always been one of my go-to beers and this edition is indeed a little """extra""" - it is extra fruity.  I really like it, but I still prefer the base version."

""

""
""

"O: Another super delicious and extremely crushable ipa from Lagunitas. They're one of the masters of the game, and this beer further solidifies their place as one of my top favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Stumbled on a lone bottle in a build your own 6 pack section so I have no idea how fresh it really is, but even if it's less than fresh it's still pretty tasty. I will look to try this again."

"Dark golden colored with a half inch of off white to light brown foam on top.  Excellent clarity.  Heavy Brussels lacing.  Bold aroma of citrus hops with a sharp orange note.  The flavor is razor sharp bitterness at the front of the palate that does not diminish at the back of the palate or even in the fade.  Mouth is actually deceptively smooth and quaffable considering the strength.  This is exceptional."
"O-Not sure if I just need this super fresh or that I don't find it completely hits the mark."

"Excellent balance of malt and hops, with an emphasis on the hops."
"An outstanding double IPA from Lagunitas.  Very close to Sucks but not quite as fruity hopped.  Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite as assertively aromatic and flavorful as some of the other Lagunitas DIPAs, easy to skip over when it's sitting next to Hop Stoopid and Sucks."

"Honey gold in color, big off white head builds and sticks to the top most of the way through, big sticky lace down the glass makes this one nice looking beer.  Smell is of candied orange, grapefruit, lemon, and cake like sweetness.  Taste is hop forward, soft cake like malt backbone from the wheat works it's way in and out with flavors of citrus and tropical fruit in the form of orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango.  Medium body doesn't show the heft of the ABV, sharp carbonation breaks into a more creamy and coating feel on the finish.  Overall this is a great DIPA which uses light malt flavors and showcases some really fruity hops."
""
""
"Great clean tasting IPA, but I am not crazy about the hops in this one. For whatever reason it comes across a little to orangey and lemon noted.  Not much balance in the malt backbone here. Its enjoyable but there are plenty of other IPA's that I would pick up before this one.  Worth a try if you like IPA's because this one is made very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is heavy and pine-hoppy but not too much so. This is a potent but very well-done hop bomb, a little more over-the-top than Little Sumpin Sumpin, but still a must-try for IPA fans."
"F The taste is very much like the aroma....good citrus.....malt....and a balanced lingering bitterness.  It is not an astringent IPA .....which is fine....for an Imperial IPA it has a very nice balance...."
""
"A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale is a tasty, easy drinking double IPA. Although the sweetness from the caramel malts was a bit excessive, this beer is still quite solid."
""
""
""
"The biting bitter hops are what make this beer worth talking about.  They stand out and take things over. Pretty good."
""
""
""
"This righteously lives up to the lofty expectations of a Lagunitas-made DIPA."
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this take on Little Sumpin' and would opt for if I were looking for something a bit different."

"o: A dankish and fairly strong DIPA, rather Stone-like but with slightly more floral/citrusy aspect, though perhaps not as much as Sucks.  Definitely one for hopheads to look for.  I know I will.  Just dunno how I managed to miss this last year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: impressed.....with the age of this the beer is drinking like an IPA half it's age but if you like vivacious carbonation beautiful billowy head and great lacing. With an Imperial that's a little sweeter and very balanced seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, from the first whiff, this beer reminded us of a supped-up version of Sucks.  The hop profile through the aroma is nearly spot-on, but the beer is made more serious by heavier booze, harsher metallics, and more bittered grain.  The nose is much more exciting than the flavor, which falls more heavily to the aforementioned notes, boxing out the base a bit.  That said, this is an easy drinking, hearty beverage that is perfectly aligned with the rest of the “Sumpin’” series.  It is obviously most comparable to the standard Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’, but again, does feel like a hybrid between that far off original and their latest hit of Sucks.  It may take you to the end of the first bottle to really get into this one, as it did with us, but fear not, because that alluring Lagunitas mystique will surely pull you back in, making it hard for you to not chain-drink the entire pack."
""
""
""
""
""

"The first sip very balanced. It is smooth, perfect carbonation and is not overpowering but the piney, fruity hoppiness is strong. It is a very easy drinker and pairs well with a good ribeye or something like that. I agree with the person who called it a """food beer""". All in all, Lagunitas is killin' it! I love my Heady Topper but this beer has to be world class. The right word is balanced. It is aromatic, makes you want more with the complexities with the hoppy, citrusy, floral cornucopia  yet is a smooth companion. Very understated for an Imperial Ale but does the trick it's supposed to and more. I'll bypass my Magic Hat variety and get another right now............."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll have to find a bottle - not sure if there's anything wrong with the keg this growler came from but it just doesn't match what I usually get from Stone or the other reviews here. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't quite have the freshness I usually taste. I'll re-review when I get a bottle"

"Pours clear amber color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are decent.  Has a nice citric, piney aroma.  The hoppiness is very evident.  Has a strong citric malty taste with a moderate piney hoppiness.  Piney, bitter aftertaste that is a tad too soapy.  Aftertaste is a little too astringent.  Still a decent beer.  The aroma makes it."

"I always see this one lying around and have never picked it up before. Today, I went to one of my local beer shops and picked up a 6 pack of this on a whim. $10.99 for a DIPA? I'm in. Poured into my Speigelau IPA glass. Golden yellow like a wheat (technically it is a wheat). Nice thick white head. Smells amazing. Citrusy, fruity, some malt sweetness. Taste is tropical fruit and citrus. A lot of orange, grapefruit, and mango. The wheat and malt balance well with the hops. IBU is in the 60s which is pretty low for a DIPA but it works out so well. I give it a perfect 5 for mouthfeel because I honestly wouldn't change anything. The fact that this is 8.5% and tastes so sessionable is unbelievable to me. It's not sticky or anything. Very light. Lagunitas can do no wrong. Another amazing brew from them."
"Medium body with crisp, lively and rather high carbonation."

"O - 4.5 - This is a big, satisfying beer, but well balanced.  The focus is on hops but there is enough malt sweetness among other factors to keep it from being a one-trick pony.  Well done."

"Right out of the gate this has to be one of my favorite IPAs and beers in general as the aroma jumps out of the bottle with loads of juicy citrus and tropical fruit hop tones with a bit of apricot. The Extra poured a deep golden with a lush white head. The taste exploded with fresh hops that were straight up citrus and tropical fruit. The more I drank it the more I detected apricot tones as well. It was a huge juicy and fruity hop monster that doesn't wear down your palate with bitterness but more of a sweet and fruity bite that is both well rounded and refreshing. What an exceptional beer and another well done IPA from Lagunitas."

"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light to medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thick cap with good retention and lacing. Aroma of mild caramel malt, citrus and dank hops, tropical fruit and a spicy slightly sour component resembling rye. Flavor follows with a nice mildly caramel malt, citrus, piney and somewhat dank hops, tropical and citrus fruit, finishing with citrus rind and herbal hop bitterness. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A nicely balanced, flavorful IPA, as I expect from Lagunitas. Not as mouth numbing as some of their other hop bombs, but the great melding of a pleasant malt base with interesting hops flavors works quite well. Rarely disappointed by this brewery, and this one is excellent."

"Overall, this is another home run from Lagunitas, pretty close to being on a par with Sucks."

"A fabulous brew from a house that I think is the best all-around in the entire country! All of their offerings have always pleased my palate, and their base IPA is a daily drinker in my beer fridge. This one, Brown Shugga, and Undercover Shutdown Ale are my three faves, although I've never been disappointed in any Lagunitas product! Having a Pit Bull (my favorite dog - I have 2) as their mascot only makes it better for me!"

"Golden orange in color with a yellow hue along the edge and perfect clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Sharp pineapple aroma with orange zest, honey and sugary malt. Medium bodied with a slick oily feel up front followed by a light, tangy rush of carbonation. Sugary sweet malt and intense pineapple flavors up front and through the middle. Pineapple flavors transition to tangy, biting herbal hops to the end. Finished with a lingering pine hop bitterness. Seemingly a variation of Sumpin, Sumpin, which is a better brew."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/22/2014. Pours crystal clear bright gold color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- This one is very good and super easy to drink for the ABV, but I think I do prefer the regular Little Sumpin' for some reason. I just remember last time I had the regular one it really popped to me more than this one does. Still, being that this is a limited release, I suggest you seek it out in one form or another."

"Lush with tropical aromas, I see my life before me. To taste it is to breathe; there is so much citrus, and zests that want to explore me. The mouthfeel, the mouthfeel talks for days as if it adores me. A Lil Sumpin' Extra! is a sneaky success, beautiful with every caress, and a slender thing that I hope never bores me."
""
""

"Golden color, fluffy head, clear. In the aroma, biscuit, piny hops, citrus. On the palate, alcohol is present, body medium, and finishes with a lingering sweetness. Quite easy to drink for 8.5%. This is a good DIPA, though I think prefer Pliny and Wolf Among Weeds in the style, and a regular IPA in general."

"Lagunitas A Little Sumpin' Extra ---4/5."

"A golden honey pour, quite handsome. A big head and good lacing add to the attractiveness. A fresh hop scent. A girl at the neighboring table even claimed to smell hops in the air. Grapefruit, pineapple, and a fruit basket of flavor. Very nice, and well balanced though hop forward. Light carbonation and very drinkable for 8 ABV. Another well done brew by Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its Lagunitas, should you be surprised that its excellent beer? Nah. Keep on keepin on"
"O. I will keep this simple - this is a fantastic beer. Get some while it is still around."
""
"Overall - Way too sweet. But the hop flavor is good."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from a six-pack poured into a good ol' shaker pint glass. The color of dark apple juice, orange-yellow amber with an imposing (four inch or so) frothy beige head, the bigger brother (sister?) of Little Sumpin' features the expected hop-forward nose, tons of grapefruit, tangerine, and lime rinds buttressed by gummy candy malts and a slightly tart wheaty spice. Certainly resembles Little Sumpin' in its barely restrained hoppy power, an assertive yet well-rounded pine note, the aforementioned citrus rinds and juice, white pepper, musky pineapples, mangoes, and guavas, maybe a whiff of lychee or longan fruit perfume. Glorious, powerful but not coarse, showy but with considerable substance. Sweeter than its little bro, less dry and bitter although the semi-dry finish certainly features a decent dose of resinous bitters and pine needles. Sweet malts and very juicy hops like Sucks, but more compact, dare I draw this comparison? Quite thick and protrudes on the palate, although I find the moderate to high carbonation provides a foil that saves this from being too soupy. Perhaps the sweetness subsides a little over the course of a bottle, as the wheat spice and more medicinal aspects of the hops take over. Alcohol faintly perceptible and what's there adds to the experience. Probably my favorite wheat DIPA and yet another Lagunitas triumph."
"Final Thoughts: One of the best beers I've had in a long time and it's no surprise that it comes from Lagunitas. While not quite in the same vane as Sucks, Little Sumpin' Extra! is a great DIPA in its own right and nicely built off of the standard that is Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. Would I drink it again? Yes, at about $10 a sixer it's a steal."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet citrus fruit, citrus zest, and citrus juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic citrus forward hop qualities that make this one very tasty and super easy to drink."

"Overall another really good beer from lagunitas. They may be very similar in taste but I like 'em."
""

"Overall this is an outstanding beer that is complex and flavorful."
"Pours a bright golden body with a rich white head with excellent retention and lacing patterns. Aromas are bursting with hoppy electricity and sweet malty goodness. I smell a lot tropical fruit, pineapple, mango and pine resin right up front with notes of caramel and floral gardens. I love it. Super complex flavors that change with every second. It's very sweet and caramel for a brief moment before you get smacked with huge notes of orange peel, green pineapple that becomes more and more resinous, then the mid-palate becomes super spicy and caramelly sweet, before finishing and lingering long on orange peel flavors. This is a very exciting beer! I plan to grab more while it lasts."
"O: Great hop flavors, but this one seems to lack the balance of its little brother. The citric tones never quite assert themselves, so the overall impression is that this beer falls on the sweeter side. This is compounded with the slightly heavier malt bill. Overall, the beer is still amazing, but it lacks the balance and assertiveness that standard LSS offers."

"I am a big fan of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' so it was a natural choice for me to give this a try.  My wife, who isn't an IPA fan, likes to have a few sips of this one.  It has a great hop character with a lot of grapefruit flavor up front from the hops.  The beer pours well and retained its head all the way to the bottom of the glass.  I like this beer, but without comparing them side by side, I can't see the big difference between the regular Sumpin Sumpin and the extra.  That's not to say that there isn't a difference, but it didn't jump out at me.  That said, I'd drink it again (and again)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I did a side-by side with both Sumpin' and the Extra Sumpin', and aside from this being slightly darker in color, slightly maltier and slightly more dank, they are virtually the same beer... so I don't see the point in releasing this one. It's good, but just another """Nickelback song""" by Lagunitas in their continuing drive to put out new releases that taste virtually the same as the vast majority of their line-up."

"This beer blew me away. I like Little Sumpin Sumpin a lot, so I kind of assumed this would be just a hoppier/maltier version of it. I guess that's true, but it's way better than I ever imagined. It's more like a combination of Sucks, Hopslam, and Heady Topper. Don't pass up buying this beer if you see it. You won't get a better bargain on a true world-class beer."

"This is ridiculously fresh. By my calculations (damn Julian dating) is July 11th (today is 7/28) was the bottling date. Very nice. This has a clear, golden hue with some quickly disappearing finger of white head. While this didn't explode on the nose, there were some nice, subtle aromas of astringent pine (one of my favorites), and a clean, bright citrus fragrance. The tastes were lemony, fresh, and bright... with a nice piney contribution. Really crisp and refreshing (same refreshing palate brought to mind by DirtWolf). Bit oily on the mouthfeel, but expected in a big IPA style. This was a very nice, easy drinking Imperial. I'd highly recommend giving it a try."

"O - Every time this is released, I try to grab a 6 pack. It's probably my favorite of their IPA's just behind, Sucks. If you have never had this, seek it out as you will not be disappointed. Cheers!"

"O: the bigger sister of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is just about what you'd want with another 1% of abv. Fans of Lagunitas and the Sumpin's will surely be pleased, and most (India) pale ale fans will be as well"

"4.2/5: Lagunitas does it again!"
""
""
"Sweet, bready aroma, hints of citrus. Golden color with a mild lace. Huge, aggressive taste that pops your eyes open on first sip. Strong pine, grapefruit, malt -- it’s a powerhouse. And at 8.5%, wow, that is a tasty DIPA. Usually at 8.5% we're on the border of sweet and boozy, but this is still very juicy."
""
""
""
""
"O: A lot of comparisons to Sucks, but I don't really see it. This is just a bigger Little Sumpin to me, which is exactly what the name suggests. Sucks is a different beer, and much better IMHO. But this one is great, and Lagunitas wins again."

"O: As others have said, this is almost like a combination of Sucks and Sumpin' Sumpin' in terms of the wheat and hop presence. Maybe even a little Stoopid can be found in there as well. Solid brew all around, and quite drinkable for being 8.5%. Definitely get some, especially if you're into the Lagunitas flavor profile"
""
""
"If you like Sucks or A Little Sumpin' Sumpin', you'll like this. It looks, smells and more or less tastes like Little Sumpin' Sumpin' but has that dry finish, not quite equal to Sucks, but pretty close to it. If I had to compare it to something besides other Lagunitas products, it would be DirtWolf but with a cleaner taste and a dryer mouthfeel. Again I'm amazed at how cheap and available this is, also. $43 a case here in eastern PA! If """Availability""" was a category, this would definitely rate equally with Heady Topper and Hop Drop & Roll. Make """Price""" a category it would leave 'em in the dust. Excellent beer at an excellent price while supplies last!"

"Poured out a clear deep gold with a creamier white head. The head has moderate retention and leaves nice soapy lacing. The aroma is mild, but with nice distinct notes of pine and fruit. The taste is close to the smell but just amplified. It has great blending of the hops components (citrus, pine, floral) and a great malt backbone to stand up to it. The body is just right, not too heavy but not watery, either. A great Imperial IPA."

"Credit to Lagunitas for their consistently tasty, yet affordable, beers. Here's another one."
""
""
"Overall: I have yet to try Sucks, but this just may be my favorite lagunitas beer to date. Such fresh qualities to it and goes down extremely smooth for almost 9%. At $7.99 a 64 oz growler at my local store, it's a complete steal IMO, and to me is the perfect budget Enjoy By (or any world class hard to find/expensive IPA for that matter). I just wish it was a year round offering. Highly recommended nonetheless! Cheers!!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden body with large head and lace patches. Aroma is citric hop dominance but there are notes of grapefruit sweetness as well. Well balanced and the hops are plentiful and beer remains smooth, some minor sweet malts but finish is dry with a dryness of bread or cracker. An IPA that is real simple but excellently constructed and a must have."
""
""

"I wish this was year-round. I like this better than Little Sumpin. It has what I'm looking for in an IPA. A double IPA.. The aroma is great, and the hops bomb is amazing. I love the flavor profile. The malt is just right, with the citrus, mango/peach flavor taking the show."

"Pours clear and golden amber. It shines like a gold bar and is lovely and clear with a fat head of creamy off white foam that falls lazy and leaves creamy lace. Nose is sugar cookie. Sweet little malt and lots of citrus. Lemon peel, soft ripe orange underneath and a hop spice that is a bit ticklish to the nose. Drinks sweetly and softly with a creamy mouthfeel. Ample carbonation that lightens the drink but does not bite. The fruits combine in this one for a punch like quality and the tangy hop spice causes the illusion of pineapple. No alcohol in the drink and this one finishes dry and with a solid bitter that does strip the palate. There is a bit of sticky resin to coat the throat in the end and that brings the fruit flavors forward once more and a lets a taste of honey from the malt be realized before it's done."
""

""
""

"Excellent IIPA. Reminds me a lot of Victory Hop Ranch, which is also a well-mannered, citrusy, extremely drinkable IIPA with a sweet and bitter citrus-like character. Really nice beer. I think I will buy this one again."

"Definitely enjoyed the extra in this Lil Sumpin. The beer poured a nice clear copper with white head that left a nice lacing. The scent had pine and citrus and the taste followed suite. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and is well worth the try."

"Pours classic IPA look transparent yellow with frothy head. Nose is really nice citric, fairly da and sticky but still on the fruity side of the hop spectrum but with nice resinous qualities. Taste matches. Awesome IIPA fresh citric hop, tropical fruit. Really nice medium to full body, I could drink this constantly, in fact, think I will. SO good. Check it out if you get the chance. This can hold its own next to all the big boys, great job on this beer!"

"A most excellent IPA, probably their second best after Sucks. I'm really happy they brought this one back."
""
""
""
""
"Its soul of wheat gives A Little Sumpin' Extra that little something extra that without the description, you'd be hard pressed to put your finger upon. Its a firmly supported, hop-dominant ale that doesn't allow the heartiness of higher-kilned barley to compete. Its simply a masterful taste and a culinary delight."
"O- Assertive but somehow balanced. A masterpiece of an IPA. Been waiting a long time to finally try this and it delivered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really enjoyable beer. Might enjoy this guy's little brother a bit more, but I'm good for a 6-pack of this every time it's released."
""
"Excellent little sumpin' extra. The extra is more hops. As a fan of the standard (and this coming from a stout and Belgian drinker) it is a wonderfully balanced ale. Pours a lustrous amber yellow with thick off white foam and amazing cling to the side of the glass lacing. Smells of grapefruit and heavy citrusy oranges and lemons with a sweet malt background. Taste is excellent with citrus hops up front---grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest, and with a balanced sweet background and decent carbonation to make it very satisfying. Aftertaste is citrus laced bittering hops that hangs with you. While NOT a hop head, I like this beast, although Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is still in my opinion a more balanced ale, this is a close second. I enjoy it more with each sip and find myself editing the review as I go...THAT is a world class beer in my humble opinion. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I love Sumpin and this is literally an amped up version of it - flavors are a bit more bold, there is a touch more sweetness and juiciness, and the finish is just a bit more drying and bitter. This is truly a Little Sumpin Extra, and an excellent Lagunitas DIPA that you should try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sumpin's slightly bigger sister...not a crazy DIPA, but an interesting wheat DIPA nonetheless. I definitely enjoy this Sumpin' variant when it comes out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Basically an imperial version of Sumpin' Sumpin'. As with its more diminutive counterpart, the wheat is somewhat downplayed in taste (but not body) as the hops are the focus. Bitterness is tame, but not flavor. This is brimming with enticing tropical hop taste. But for a good dose of alcohol warmth, it drinks much the same as Sumpin' Sumpin' too. I think I still prefer Sumpin' Sumpin', but this will not disappoint by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a tad more hopped up version of lil sumpin sumpin. exactly what youd expect."
"O-They know how to produce hoppy brews. Even more importantly, they know how to make each one stand out. Another high quality bottle of hop sauce."
""
""
""
"O - really good and so close to a 4.5/5 overall. Nice flavors and nice balance. I will be buying this again."
"Overall: A very good Double IPA. Great West Coast citrus hop presence with a nice malt backbone. This is a lot like Sucks."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the smell made me think Sucks, but the taste is more akin to DFH 90 min, it's weird but still good"
"The taste is an overindulgence in hops, which completely overpowers a hugely malted brew. It is almost balanced. Like I said, the others in this line have more of the wild yeastiness underneath, but it's still there on this one too. The aftertaste is satisfaction - you've had your taste buds blasted with goodness."
""
""
""
"this is excellent beer, and of all the high alcohol hoppy beers these guys make, this may be my favorite by a considerable margin. an amazingly clear brew, no sediment at all, no haze, just sunny and bright, with a tall white head and a nose of very intense hops. citra hops in here for sure, especially as an aromatic dry hop. but there are others as well in here, as its more complex than the sometimes one dimensional (even though we adore them) citra. a honey sweetness on the front end, not super malty, but a fuller blonde malt body at first. so hoppy though, and the grain only supports it. hints of lemon curd, palm sugar, and tangerine zest in the hops, along with a piney bitterness as it closes out. wonderfully hopped, so oily and textured, but so light and bright too, one would never know this is as strong as it is. I've wanted to try this one for a long time, and find it to be a well above average west coast ipa. i like that the grain gives body without a ton of weighty sugary flavor. its dynamic and exciting and the perfect big ipa for hot weather. how fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy this one tremendously.  Would highly recommend and it's definitely off center from other IPAs."
"Great flavoring hop profile. Malt is just enough to offset, for my palate. Not overly bitter, fairly complex. I am not a fan of onion in my beer, but the citrus kills it."

""
""
""
"O: With anything Lagunitas I knew I was going to have a high quality, tasty beer. I didn't realize how much this beer was going to bowl me over. As a huge Sucks fan this beer is quite similar in pretty much every category to me."
"O- Although brewed at least once before, this is my first take on the brand. After one bottle, I am hooked and this stands to be my favorite of the 'Sumpin' trilogy (year-round, Wild and Extra!). Although a perennial fan of Hop Stoopid, I would like for this to replace it in Lagunitas' year round offerings as it is that good...shame on me for not picking up more than a 6-Pack! (4.75)"
""
"Pours almost orange with a nice head that left lacing on the glass. The smell was full of hops with floral and citrus notes. My favorite part of the beer was the taste (as it should be) where I found a lot of great hop flavor in the beginning that quickly faded away to a crisp and refreshing finish. It was very pleasant and I loved the earthy aftertaste it left. The mouthfeel was solid as well. Overall I would definitely recommend."

"Whew. This one is nice 'n' hoppy. Good spicy tones with a lot of citric and somewhat acidic bite. It's firm and slightly harsh, but in all the right ways. This might be interesting to try on cask. Regardless of that, this is a nice one. Lagunitas really impresses me every time I dwell on it. Their consistent delivery of superior beers produced on a large scale is a sign of their ability. Good drinkin'."

"There is something unique about the carbonation profile of their beers. Lots of floral character with that oily hop flavor that these guys are so good at. Time for a trip to Cali!"
"Had this in a bottle today. I was pleasantly surprised. The smell first didn't excite me, but the taste and mouthfeel made up for it. This could be an everyday drinking beer. Went down smooth. Not overly hoppy or alcoholic. Excellent aftertaste. I will be drinking this one again."
"O ~ a solid Lagunitas offering. Can't go wrong."
"The pour was very nice, rich amber in color with a huge cascading white head that just would not quite no matter what. Really nicely done I have to admit. Even after a few minutes it was still going strong with rich lacing up and down the sides of the glass. Aroma was a hop bomb, cirus filling the air from the first moment and really giving you a nose full. Even warming could not cut through the grapefruit and biting sharp hop notes. Nice medium body was well carbonated and allowed the flavor to really absorb along the palate. First taste is sharp, huge notes of sticky pine and grapefruit rip the tongue but mellow out a bit behind a biscuit like mi palate. Some nice notes of grain plugging through in here I have to say before a smack of hops dries the palate and leaves a bit of a hot boozy note on its way down."
"Lagunitas really needs to bring this one back. It's not like they're not putting out beers with equal quality, but this is a real winner. Seeing this in 6pks would be amazing, but I'll take a bomber. Great beer!"
"Good solid DIPA that is full of citrus and pine notes with a thick mouthfeel almost chewy which works for the flavour profile. I liked the long finish and found the nose big and full of hops. The ABV was not really noticeable but rather the bigness of the beer made it more of a sipping exercise than a refresher"
"Lagunitas does it again. This beer really surprised me, I have had and love the little sumpin sumpin and thought this would taste like a stronger version. This is a completely special beer all unto itself. The color was a little on the light side, but in every other catagory it was amazing. It was the lack of overwhelming alcohol presence that was the most pleasant surprise. Great beer!!"
"Pours a really nice golden color with a white head. The nose is pretty strong and has some really overpowering hops. Loads of citrus as well as a bit of pine. The taste is equally as hoppy and just really brings on the citrus rind and a tiny amount of malt in the background. Good bitterness and a nice body. Another really nice hoppy beer from Lagunitas."
"Very nice take on the DIPA."
"D: ABV withstanding, this is a very well balanced DIPA with a clean mouthfeel and a good balance of hops and bitterness"
"On tap at Eli's during the Dating Game. My editor was being set up with Hoagie's wife's friend Laura. A little too sweet for me. A very solid double ipa but I prefer hop bombs. While there is a lot of nice grapefruit bitterness there is an overwhelming syrupy sweetness to it. The individual components could have been a bit tighter. I'm knit picking here but at this stage in the game I expect a lot from a double ipa to bring it to that A,A+ level. Just like Laura for The Larse... this one really didn't do it for me. It didn't move once throughout the whole pint."
"Oh so very drinkable, I could drink this forever. If you have a chance to pick it up do it, you will not regret it."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good beer that is worth drinking for an entire evening."
"D-A good DIPA with more malt presence than Hop Stoopid. Would readily enjoy this again."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Clear light amber color. Nose is pine hops. Flavor is strong pine hop, hoping for a little caramel, don't find any. No doubt this has high IBUs. Label puts the ABV at 7.5%. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"This is a very fine beer, especially when set in an appropriate summer context. In this instance, hot and humid. Nicely balanced, the hops is prominent, but not overwhelming, and followed closely by a powerful citrus taste. Well done in my judgment, not overdone in one area or the other. It pours a moderate sized head, a touch tingly on the tongue, oweing mostly to the high ABV. The aftertaste is a it subtle, until you pucker your cheeks a bit and find the hops resting comfortably on your pallet, and in no hurry to go anywhere."
"Got a bottle from the Bier Stein in Eugene, OR. A very refreshing beer, very hoppy smell as well as a quite hoppy taste, but not overbearing. the alcohol flavor is there but quickly disappears. I would drink about 100 of these of the Abv wasn't so high."
"This beer is excellent. A very nice strong aroma of imperial flavor. The hops are intense but not overbearing and the color is georgeous. Find time to drink this beer when you can pour it in a glass and savor the flavor, aroma, and appearance. This beer is similar to the Lagunitas Maximus. If you like the Maximus this is what you are looking for. The Little Sumpin Extra is exactly that, something extra. It takes the goodness of the Maximus to a whole new level and is the best tasting Lagunitas I've had to date."
"D I like it a lot; it's complex but very balanced."
"A nice beer that I would not mind drinking again."
"Pours a slightly hazy coppery-orange color with a couple fingers of dense white foam on top. For some reason we never got the little sumpin' sumpin' out here, so I have no point of reference. Nice floral hoppy aroma, with pine, grapefruit and a little orange. Very hoppy on the palate, citrus and pine, with just a little sweet malt to balance it out. Alcohol is well hidden here, making this one very dangerously drinkable."
"Bought a bomber of this excitedly as I am a big fan of the lil sister which dried up much too quickly. Pint glass pour and I am met with an apricot colored ale with a small foamy head that slowly dissolves and clings to the side. The aroma consists of grapefruit, pineapple and other citrus delights. Hoptastic taste with grapefruit in the forefront and a slight maltiness to even it out. Nicely done. High carbonation makes it a little rough on the swallow. High drinkability as two bombers were easily consumed in the session. Overall I think is a great beer though I prefer the lil' sister to this brew."
"Overall a great disappointment after I enjoyed a lil sumpin sumpin so much. Just kinda over bitter and stale tasting. I would attribute this to age but there's no freshness date and the bottle showed no sign of sitting around label looked new and no dust etc. I'll likely revisit this when I go to the brewery and re review if things are different."
"D - Greatly drinkable. Complex and inviting. Alcohol content and taste might hold you back from having a lot though."
"D= for anyone who enjoys APA or IPA's this is great stuff. The bottle that I have is 22 ounce and at the 8.74% ABV I doubt I could take more than one or two but they'd be very drinkable and enjoyable. Probably great with baked or roasted chicken dishes or maybe white-saucy Italian dishes."
"This is one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've tried. Lagunitas does it again, this one is almost as good, if not better than Hop Stoopid."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a large white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is floral hops with grainy malts in the background. Taste starts with a nice cereal malt backbone finishing with a dry citrus hop. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, finishing crisp on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This is a well balanced double ipa that I am glad to have had the opportunity to try."
"Verdict: A Little Sumpin' Extra is a serviceable little brew, and instantly recognizable as a Lagunitas beer. The Double IPA seems to be misused here, but I really can't come up with anything more appropriate--a familiar feeling with this company. I just wish I had been able to try the original beforehand."
"M/D: Wouldn't drink more than one of these in a single session."
"D- I think I like it's little sister better, but this is a nice DIPA. I just couldn't put as many of these down as I could of the sumpin sumpin ale."
"Medium bodied, slightly creamy, and seems to have just the right amount of carbonation. Easy to drink, and at 8+% ABV not overly boozy. A well made DIPA."
"Not bad, but not an Imperial IPA. Not enough hop representation happening for that. Maybe an imperial copper ale?"
"This is definitely excessively carbonated; the second pour of this foams quite a bit as it hits my tongue. Luckily some vigorous swirling gets rid of the excess fizz. This is definitely a beer that will appeal to the hop heads out there. This has a very clean malt character; just enough to support the malt, no real crystal malt notes to get in the way of the clean, hubristic hop notes. This is quite a nice beer to spend an evening with; I certainly wouldn't mind have a case of this in the fridge. I am a sucker for super fresh IPAs and dry Double IPAs as long as the quaffability is high."
"Lots of hops with little malt to balance makes for kind of an intense experience. Good overall."
"D – This is one of the only times I have ever referred to alcohol tasting too strong; it is seldom an issue for me. But when a beer is unbalanced, any element can be irking."
"Very good beer"
"D - This is another great hopped-up brew from Lagunitas. Really great tasting."
"D: Overall a decent DIPA, a nice offering from Lagunitas, but probably not as good as their regular offerings."
"D: My bomber was gone in minutes could have been the rough friday night but i crushed this one and would but again and again at 5 bucks a bomber to what's not to love. phonamial"
"D: This is a good solid Imperial IPA. I have no complaints and would gladly drink this anytime."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer that I greatly appreciate being able to enjoy on the east coast. Certainly worth a try if you like hops."
"M, D- A straightforward IPA with a good shot of additional bitterness, but without the extra malt to balance it. Without major flaws, but it did not compel me to want to repeat it. Easily drinkable, but not inspiring."
"Poured a double deuce into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a reddish amber with a massive 3 inch creamy head that leaves a curtain of lacing down the sides of the glass. Maybe because it's a amped up version of a Pale Ale instead of an IPA, the main aroma component is toffee and other sweet malts. Hops are present with orange and lemon peel, a bit of sweet mango but really the malt backbone is the basis of this beer. Its sweet and the hops really take a back seat. Bready malts with toffee and caramel, a bit of brown sugar, make up the front of the flavor profile. The hops come through on the middle with mango and pineapple. The citrus is rather subdued and definitely no pine. The mouthfeel is full and creamy leaving a lingering bitterness on the palate. Over all, I think I'll spend my $3.99 on a Hop Stoopid. While I like balanced DIPA's, this is just a bit to malty for my tastes."
"Very nice on the mouth, very drinkable, a great example of the style."
"Overall- very sweet and very hoppy at the same time. big beer with unique hopping and sweet malt."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Alcohol harshness get a little rough as it warms. Definately not a sessionable beer. Another nice example from our boys in Petaluma."
"This is a good DIPA that's very drinkable and showcases the juicy citrus from start to finish."
"orange/yellow color with nice clarity and a dense, lasting off-white head and lacing. tropical fruit, citrus, floral, and resin notes. sweet honeyed bready malts are balanced out by a big but smooth hop bitterness. like drinking hop candy. medium to full body. another nice one from this brewery."
"Forget Hop Stoopid, this is the DIPA you want from Lagunitas."
"Warming taste, alcohol is present, but very well balanced. Adequately carbonated, clingy dry finish...bitter beer"
"For the $3.79 or w/e I paid for it, it was definitely a bargain, not one of my top favorites though. The taste was great, but it feels like it could have been bigger."
"Pours a hazy, golden/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, citrus, slight sweet malt, and flowers. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, citrus (tangerine/mango), sweet malt, flowers, and very slight roasted malt. Overall, rather fruity beer, but still good blend, body, and complexity."
"D - This is another good DIPA from Lagunitas that I really enjoyed and could drink too much of if you like hops this is a beer for you worth trying sometime"
"Another solid effort from Lagunitas (though can we beef up the nose a bit?}, if not terribly memorable."
"D- It's not the best beer I've ever had but it's pretty damn good. Good taste and well built throughout"
"Still, this is really good stuff, and Lagunitas continues to impress. All the more enjoyable is that this fine DIPA comes at an accessible price, $4.29. Well worth a go."
"I (along with many others) have posted online about the great value of Lagunitas beer, with bombers of A Little Sumpin' Extra, Hop Stoopid, and even their Olde GnarlyWine going for $3-$4 here in everything-costs-more Connecticut (apparently cheap across the country as well). Don't get the wrong idea though; this value isn't remarkable just because it's 9%~ beer for $3/22oz. It's remarkable because Lagunitas makes high quality beer. Hop Stoopid and Sumpin Extra are easy go-to beers for me, with the latter probably a bit preferable to the former. Tonight I wanted a nice, refreshing but interesting DIPA, which is exactly what this beer delivers."
"A really good, extremely enjoyable and fresh tasting DIPA. With this beer and Hop Stoopid Lagunitas is definitely doing sumpin' right when it comes to double IPAs."
"Great refreshing lighter side of hop bombs. Awesomely fresh and hoppy. Hop heads only."
"D - A very tasty IIPA, very hoppy no doubt about that, still very drinkable - I could hand a bomber or two easily -seek this out."
"Drinkability: Scary good. Refreshing and delicious. Not much wheat character really, I guess its overwhelmed by the hops."
"An enjoyable IIPA from Lagunitas for sure."
"D: Very drinkable. I thoroughly enjoyed every sip."
"Notes: This is a great double i.p.a very drinkable with such nice sweetness. Cheers."
"Overall, a very solid brew by a brewery that I'm unhappily too unfamiliar with. This one is not a hop-bomb, but is a nicely balanced, easy-drinking DIPA. I would definitely recommend this brew and would certainly not mind parting with $3.99 for another bomber."
"Overall, this is another great beer from Lagunitas. Along with Bear Republic they really represent Sonoma County well!"
"Overall, a very good beer, I'd say, although a bit syrupy at times. Pours a nice tawny orange color with moderate white head that leaves moderate lacing. Smell is big on the citrus hops, with a bit of sugary sweetness and maybe grapes sneaking in. Taste has a fair amount of citrus hop flavor, with a decent caramel malt backbone. Not nearly as much hop kick as the nose might suggest. Lingering resinous flavor. MF is substantial, creamy, and a bit prickly. Drinkability is good, a decent sipper, although the body to it can get a but syrupy at times. Glad I picked it up, especially at $5 a bomber."
"Overall, a good DIPA, but not a fantastic one for me. Interesting and unique but in the end I didn't love the medicinal qualities that showed through."
"Drinkability- Overall a pretty damn good brew. It's amazingly balanced (for the style anyways) and a real pleasant surprise. The hoppiness is still nice and fruity and the alcohol is covered fairly well. This one was a hit. Thanks much Jason!"
"tastes great, goes down smooth, not as strong as I'd expect for a double/imperial at all, and alcohol well hidden."
"overall a very nice imperial IPA"
"Drinkability: Well, it's a run-of-the-mill Double IPA for me, having left behind the grace and ease of it's younger cousin, going back to bitter and basic and not too terribly far removed from their other basic, bitter brews."
"D- Pretty much the perfect session beer for me because I don't like to drink a whole lot but still get drunk"
"Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with a stiff two finger foamy white head that decomposes slowly leaving crazy amounts of lacing to be enjoyed. Cap's off...you can smell the pineapple grapefruit from arms length. Adequately carbonated, the tangy mouth feel complements the piny hop flavor really well. Really smooth, the pine resin taste lingers appropriately. Also has a substantial malty sweet base beneath it all. A nice complexity to a real fine drinker. The 8.74% ABV warms some on the way down. Wow, another quality beverage from team Lagunitas. Highly recommended."
"Comes as a clear golden orange. Looks lively. Nice white foam cap sitting on top. There was probably more to the flavor than what I will describe but this was a grapefruit hop bomb. It's fairly dry for its strength, but there is a noticeable DIPA type sweetness lingering in the background. Overall a general feeling of crispness to go along with that assertive grapefruit punch. Really enjoyed this beer."
"D: Ice cold this could be something enjoyed all night. Really glad I found this. Lagunitas keeps impressing me. Highly Recommend."
"A good find, kind of like an imperial wheat/ipa/barleywine. Not really easily categorized, but definitely worth checking out."
"A solid DIPA and a pleasure to drink. Definitely wouldn't mind picking up another."
"Palate has plenty of tartness and pine from the hops, with the malt that is there having some of that candied character come through. Alcohol is somewhat subdued but you can tell it's a DIPA."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for a brew with a higher ABV like this. I will seek out more of this to keep on hand. Love this stuff!"
"Nice one overall."
"Drinkability - This is a class act and actually quite original. The flavors are very unique and this beer goes down wonderfully."
"Reviewed on 9/10/2009. Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a thick, foamy white head. Aroma of sweet tropical fruits, orange peel, grapefruit, and lots of citrus. Yum! Flavor of lots of citrus (orange zest) and grapefruit with some caramel malt and bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable and delicious. Another tasty hop-bomb from Lagunitas."
"Very nice offering from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability> Very good. I'll have another, please."
"In the end, A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale is good beer that doesn't quite match the beer that inspired it, much less supercede it. I'm still enjoying it quite a bit and would gladly fork over $5.08 for another bomber."
"Smooth, nice carbonation with a bit of a solid alcohol kick. Finishes crisp and pure and flowery; like dandelions on a cool spring evening. Too bad it is wet and cold outside, but the New York Football Giants are looking locked and loaded."
"Overall impression: Pleased with this beer although it's not remarkable. Great find for the value, but I wouldn't scour the earth for another."
"OVERALL way more bold than subtle. Strong booze in the nose and flavor somehow blend well with other influences. Almost but not quite out of whack, but intruiging and drinkable to this hop head."
"Not only would I recommend this beer, I will pick up more as soon as I see it again. This beer is right on the top of my list of greats."
"This is a Hop monster, crisp, citrus notes, great taste and drinkability. Great sticky lace that doesn't fade and leaves residual on the sidewall of the glass. Highly recommend this beer."
"Drinks very easy for the ABV & style, not a perfect DIPA, but no real faults either"
"Easy enough to drink even though I'm not enjoying that strong floral flavor too much. Maybe the soup I just made will bring the taste up a bit more."
"A light golden copper color with a very healthy white head and a great patchwork of lacing. The aroma comes on with pleasant light grapefruit and floral hints. The flavor is quite a bit more forceful with thick piney hops and a grapefruit kick, biscuit caramel butterscotch touches in a mid to full bodied stick to your ribs dipa. There's a tart and slightly alcohol edge here, sweet and bright but a chewy brew that is midland drinkable. A substantial contribution from the Lagunitas beer gods!"
"Mouthfeel is light and fresh, and very drinkable. Very nice beer."
"Nice DIPA in the standard Lagunitas vein in that it is definitely hop dominant but not just a hop bomb."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazed muted golden yellow color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. The head leaves a nice lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of citrus fruits such as tangerines, oranges, and grapefruits (both white and red)light lemon notes, as well as apricots, peaches, more grapefruit, and a bit of alcohol heat. Quite fruity to say the least with bittersweet notes from start to finish. Amply carbonated with a medium body at minimum. Overall pretty nice and certainly worth checking out if you have the chance."
"Lagunitas a Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale is clear and dark golden with a thin white film that leaves tenacious foam on the glass. It's sweet and sugary smelling, with notes of dark fruit, maybe plum. It's smooth, sticky and pretty full bodied with a sharp finish. It's pretty huge. It's sweet and quite bitter. There's a peaty note in there. It has a long juniper finish. Wow. It's bold."
"Overall, this is a nice DIPA. I wasn't blown away, but I would have it again. The aroma seemed a little weak, but then again, I don't know how old this bottle is, so the floral aromas associated with the hops may be somewhat faded. Anyways, if you like grapefruit oriented DIPAs, pick this guy up. You won't be disappointed."
"I likes. If the price is right, I will buy many more."
"MF/D: This beer was an easy drinking, good for a change, kind of a brew, though it's nothing I'd write home about."
"Yeah, sumpin' special indeed. Had the texture been a little rounder, I'd be racin' out to get more, but I'm not complainin'. Kind of borders between IPA and 2xIPA, but who cares how its classified when it tastes this good. Super-drinkable, especially considering the style; would buy again in a heartbeat."
"D-Undetectable 8.7%, very well masked. has a nice long warming finish."
"Great mouthfeel, everything is spot-on. Great seasonal, and one of the most unexpectedly outstanding beers I've had in a hot minute. If you see a tap bearing the Extra! tag, hit it up fast."
"D- This beer drinks very well. I was done with my half of the beer before I even knew it. Not a good thing because I didn't bring my other bottle from mjl21 a.k.a. Mike. Bleh..."
"Pours slightly hazy golden/orange color with nice looking white head. Smells like a shitload of grapefruit blended with pine needles. Tastes like...a shitload of grapefruit blended with pine needles. Though there is a fair amount of malt here to partially balance things out. Fairly bitter, but a tad sweet. So not the driest ipa ever. Body is fairly thick with lots of carbonation. It's rare that I want to drink very much of an IPA, and this isn't one of those beers that makes me want to keep drinking."
"Really didn't expect this one to be so awesome! Just leave it to Lagunitas to leave you speechless, I guess."
"Thank you Lagunitas for satisfying my palate way beyond my expectations."
"Pours a nice gold with a massive, long lasting head and tons of lacing. Strong aroma of grapefruit and a little resin. Quite full and pleasing. Wow, the initial flavor very closely follows the aroma. I expected over powering hops but it ends up surprisingly balanced. It still favors the hops, mind you, but also has some sweetness too. I can feel the alcohol in my stomach, but it doesn't have a strong presence in the flavor. Mouth feel is also dead center, with medium carbonation. Overall very nice indeed."
"This is a great DIPA. i"
"Edit: Drinkability is now Overall, and overall this is gorgeous! +.5%"
"Drinkability: Lagunitas always has a fair price on their beer. $4.99 for this bomber. A nice aroma and flavor profile make this a great beer that I'd love to see turn into a regular offering. Lagunitas, as always, well done."
"A: Solid head on a hard pour, the color of wet hay, the foam top settles into a rocky, cottony head - 4.25, S: The aromas are solid hops with a hint of clove, lots of citrus with a woodsy smell as well, I hate to use the word delicate - but it is apt in describing the wonderful use of hops, I'm guessing Centennial played a part in the hop build, one of the better noses on an IPA that I've smelled in some time - 5.00, T: Bitter but not harsh, like the nose there is quite a bit of citrus in this one - I get grapefruit and a touch of pine, there is also a slight grainy sweetness - 4.25, M: Quite creamy and even silky - 4.50, D: One of the more drinkable IPAs I've had in some time, thumbs up to Lagunitas - 4.50"
"A little Sumpin Extra is a MASTERPIECE. This is as good a DIPA as there is on the market. Tons of hop aroma and flavor. Delicious, ripe citrus, no resinous piney flavors. Nice citrus aroma. The drinkability is amazing. No trace of the high ABV. I could drink this all day. One of the best beers I've had in a long time. Totally impressed."
"Overall, a very nice stapleish big IPA. Very drinkable and very flavorful. Not as exciting as some better CA IPAs, doesn't quite get up to that """next level", but still very nice. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Lagunitas keeps producing quality brew after quality brew, and they manage to keep everything, somehow, fairly cheap, which to me is pretty insane. Even though it's fairly high in ABV, this is extremely easy to take down by yourself if you're all about the flavorful and hoppy brews. Hopefully they decide to make it year round. I'll be on board for it as a staple if that happens."
"Lightish golden/orange and just a hint of haze. Two fingers of slightly off-white head about the consistency of whipped egg whites. As has been mentioned, lots of lacing. Lots of hops on the nose. Strong pine and then some orange. You also get a hint of some bready malts. Lots of resiny pine on the tongue. Hints of orange, but grapefruit is the predominant citrus. Just enough malt sweetness there to give a hint of balance. There's also a faint soapiness mixed in. I really didn't find the alcohol to be noticeable. Nice hint of sticky thickness. Yet, again Lagunitas hits a homer."
"Drinkability: Truly amazing lacing (I feel the need to mention this again) on a pungent if Simple Simple DIPA. Let's be clear - this is not a complex beer by any stretch of the imagination. But it's pungent and strikes a good combination among its various constituent components, much like Hop Stoopid manages to do. A solid west coast DIPA."
"This is not a beer I am enamored of; DIPAs are often quite drinkable due to their balance between strong malt and huge hop presence. This one is almost all hops and so not terribly drinkable to me."
"Hell yeah, Lagunitas!"
"Drinkability is good at the level of finishing the bomber yourself. Any more would be counter-productive. Very tasty beer."
"This is my first experience with a Double IPA, and I really enjoyed it. It's a lot more balanced than one would think. Granted, it's still definitely not sessionable by any means, but for what it is, it's awesome."
"D: This is a nicely brewed beer, well balanced, easily drinkable."
"This is a great IPA but I'd never sign myself up for more than one, unless I have no place to go that evening."
"Rich and full mouthfeel, creamy carbonation, slight warmth in the cheeks, subtle vapor rising up the back of the nose. Great beer, very tasty."
"D: Easy enough to drink, good flavors, strong flavors. Nice beer, but a little lackluster compared to other DIPAs. Still a good beer, just not quite at that """great""" level. Very enjoyable."
"The mouth is moderately carbonated, almost bordering on crisp. As I drink this, it reminds me more of a standard IPA rather than a DIPA. Strong citrus flavors right off the bat. Moderate amount of bitterness in there; finishes lightly sweet with aspects of honey and butterscotch. This was a really great beer, it just needs to be re-styled a bit. I could drink this all night!"
"Not as overwhelming as a DIPA should be, but still a damn fine ale for any hophead."
"Notes: Another tremendous brew from Lagunitas and a great DIPA. The price-quality ration remains extraordinary for these 22 Oz. bombers and Lagunitas keeps on doing masterful twists and turns to their hoppy craft. This one has a deceptively mild, almost light, body for a dipa and the high IBUs are not that high but the way that they have being worked here is fantastic, and how the aroma follows taste and pushes up the body is a great pleasure. Hop Stoopid packs a bigger hoppy punch and offers a bigger provocation in that area, A Little Sumpin´ Extra instead offers a more balanced version with a common outstanding craft and delight."
"Call it personal preference, but I'd be perfectly content if most DIPA's turned out akin to this, the malt isn't very apparent but the hops are so well contained that the imbalance is not an issue at all, it's like a silky hophead's soul kiss. Lagunitas hit a bullseye with this one."
"Other comments: Though Lagunitas' beers are good, they all taste a bit similar. Not sure if it's the malt, the hops, or their yeast (or all three), but something is blatantly taking charge of the flavor profile regardless of the beer style."
"D: A really nice effort and at $3.99, you can't beat the price!"
"22oz poured into my SA perfect pint glass. Pours a nice orange amber color with a nice white fluffy head. Laced nicely down the glass and the head stayed around a while. Smell is very good, a lot of citrus/grapefruit flavors going on. Taste is also dominated by the citrusness and grapefruit flavor of the hops. I'm getting a little pineapple flavor as well. I liked this one a lot and was a bargain at $4.50. Good Hoppy flavored DIPA for a very reasonable price."
"Drinkability: Very... Beer is dry enough to make have a few bombers an easy task. Nice mixture of smooth hop bitterness and hop flavor. I think its actually a better double IPA than Pliny the Elder...I may have to get a new avatar..."
"Conclusion: This is a tasty, fresh, herbal IIPA, but IMO is not quite up to the hype."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma awesome as hell! It has a complex malt bill of pale, Carapils, and bisquit malts along with a killer hop nose. The citrus hop character really wraps itself up nicely in the bisquit malts. The taste is good. It's got a heavy handed dose of bisquit malts as well as citrus hops. It's bready up front with a hop punch that knocks you on your ass in the finish. The mouthfeel is good as well. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tasty treat for sure. When it comes to West Coast IPA's, these guys know their shit."
"Orange clear color body, small creamy off-white head, diminishing. Nutty aroma, some citrus and grapefruit. Bubble gum, aroma. Nutty taste, bubble gum, pine and citrus. Very tasty. Bitter and caustic. Delicious, good balance."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Nice golden amber hue with a lacy light-tan head. Aroma is lightly citric with some pine and grass overtones. Flavor is a little weak for a double IPA, tastes closer to a regular IPA. Light crackery malt sits beneath some grassy and citrusy hops and a lemon candy note flits in and out of perception. Somewhat soapy like most of Lagunitas' hoppy beers. Mouthfeel is just above average and drinkability is actually pretty good."
"LOng may they prosper!"
"HV"
"Pours a golden honey color in the pint with a white, lacy froth. The nose shows louds of hops; grapefruit, cirtus, flowers/pine, lime, apricot, melon, mango, light spiciness, light biscuit, & caramel. The beer is full with a strong hop profile, but very easy to drink. Long finish, tremendous mouthfeel, & a smooth balanced bitterness from beginning to end. Overall...an amazing IPA!"
"Very nice, I would buy it again."
"Pours a lovely orange into a duvel tulip. Lot's of lacing. Smells hoppy and sweet. As noted by another reviewer, this beer goes for a different aesthetic then many IPA's, focusing on a good, well rounded piney and citrus flavor rather then extreme bitterness. A bit of a sweet aftertaste. A very pleasant beer to drink, much lighter and more effervescent then the ABV would suggest. Crisp and refreshing."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" beige head over the clear golden amber brew. Head recedes slowly, with sporadic lacing. Aroma is piney hops with a sweet undercurrent. Taste starts sweet, pine takes over in the middle, then closes with bitterness and some grapefruit, and lastly some lingering warmth. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is superb, especially for the style. I love a DIPA that goes with flavor rather than bitter for bitter's sake."
"Cairo Wine & Liquor/$4.99/22 oz"
"- Overall is somewhat drinkable, but the flavor is overdone, and just a bit too much for me. If I wanted a funky earthy hop driven citrus overkill of a brew... I would just grab an India Pelican Ale.."
"Overall I find this beer to be another well-crafted DIPA from Lagunitas. As this is a limited release I would advise any fan of balanced DIPAs to pick this up while it is still available. Recommended."
"D - A little bit surprised that this is 8.74%...alcohol is not really apparent in the flavor. Drinks more like a standard IPA...in other words, goes down pretty easy. Enjoying this beer, maybe not as much as the regular Little Sumpin' Sumpin' though."
"the finish is a good long lasting bitter that almost coats the tongue and the orange/citrus aromatics that float around the nasal cavity are just the capper. this is a wonderful hoplovers ale and i was surprised by the amount of flavor and aroma that came charging off this beer. excellent!"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff DIPA but the alcohol level kicks this down a notch. Great flavors here."
"This is a solid beer. Very good indeed. A nice elevation of an excellent bev. I'll keep an eye out for it."
"D- Alcohol is well hidden. Nothing here is unappealing. This is a very drinkable DIPA."
"Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger slightly off-white head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing. Smells of loads of tropical and slight citrus hop aromas with a solid amount of pale malt aromas lurking in the background. Tastes similar to how it smells. Explosive hop flavors overtake pale malt flavors almost immediately and carry through to a solidly bitter ending that leaves a hint of tropical fruit flavor lingering. Mouthfeel is good. It has a nice thickness with solid carbonation. Drinkability is great. I finished my glass quickly and could have a few more."
"Drinkability: Happy I picked this one up and tried it, it's got excellent balance of malt and hops and is a true hop heads fantasy beer when it comes down to it, the citrus flavors are juicy and big and the maltiness is well aligned to smooth things out perfectly. Easy to throw back a few of these, as the 8.7% ABV is barely noticeable. Another excellent, yet cheap offering from Lagunitas ($3.99 a bomber, need I say more?) I really love what these guys are doing over on the west coast."
"This poured a nearly clear amber with white head. It smelled like tons of peach and dried apricot with spicy wheat and perfume. It tasted like peach and apricot with some grapefruit and some wheat and spicy tang. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was just like the other Lagunitas with their great hop extract. Nearly identical to the regular Sumpin' Sumpin', with a subtle wheat character and a nice body. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer, so it was plenty easy to drink. Nothing too ground breaking, but a well done variation of their previous beer."
"D: I'm on the fence here. This beer even at its relatively high alcohol content would be very drinkable if not for some of its negative flavor characteristics. That said, if you set one in front of me, I wouldn't turn it away."
"D: It's certainly not a bad beer, but I wouldn't seek this one out again. The overall """flatness""" on the tongue and the heavy alcohol make this an okay beer, but it certainly lacks balance."
"D- would drink again but not going to purpously looking for it."
"Poured a golden yellow color with good carbonation and a big fluffy head. Nose is hops but not to big, grain anf floral. Taste is grain, hops, floral and citrus, bitterness on the end and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is bitter and floral.Drinakability is good."
"Drinkability isn't too high, as it's very sweet and intense, although my palate did favorably adjust about mid-way though. Still, having just had the Sierra Nevada 2009 Estate Brewer's Harvest Ale right before this, which cost 3 times of much, makes me realize how cool Lagunitas really is."
"For near 9% and 73 IBU this beer goes down like silk and I could sit and drink them all day long. One of my favorite new beers I have had in a long time and at 3.99 a bottle just fantastic!"
"Would I buy more of it? - Absolutely, I love this stuff. Its exactly what I want in my beer fridge just in case I am jonesing for hops."
"MF/D: Light to medium body, medium carbonation. Even though it gives some heat, it still finishes clean."
"D: just another solid brew in a long line of great beers. Lagunitas has a formula and they stick right to it, love it. Easy to drink and great flavors going on"
"D: A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale is another winner from Lagunitas. Sometimes I wish Lagunitas settled down and tried to really craft a world-beater of a brew. On the other hand, though, I love their exploratory spirit and the plethora of huge beers that consistently pump out with abandon at a good value."
"Drinkability is really good for this beer. The alcohol is well-hidden behind the hops. I only get its presence in the warmth that rises to my cheeks about halfway through the bottle. It is incredibly balanced for the style, something I don't always expect to get from Lagunitas. Definitely recommended."
"D: I couldn't (and shouldn't) drink these all night, but this beer looks and smells fantastic, and has a great flavor to boot. Another job well done by Lagunitas!"
"D- Another great beer from Lagunitas. Buy a couple if you see it."
"The taste was good and it was a well balanced act. The bitterness was there and the malt profile wasn't overwhelming. On the finish you got the b slap that you were drinking a double IPA. Overall I would buy it again and for under 4 bucks a great deal in my opinion."
"A slow sipper, and one to be enjoyed. I found it to be pretty unique, even in the forest of DIPAs."
"Surpisingly drinkable but quite potent."
"Drinkability...it's like there is a party in my mouth and EVERYONE is invited. Not one to slam on a hot day, but why do that with any great beer? This is a great beer!"
"D - Definitely a sipper but this really tastes great, smells great, and looks great. Not overpowering in the hops department but yet are very pronounced."
"A dull golden color with a sheet of white foam and a fair amount of lace hanging around. The aroma is very strong with a powerful grapefruit aroma. The flavor features loads of juicy grapefruit and some dry orange peel with a little bit of a resinous, piny quality. There's also a decent amount of malt sweetness balancing out the hops and keeping them in check. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a nice, snappy drying finish. A very drinkable DIPA that has plenty of hops that are managed well and aren't overbearing. Highly recommended. I've tried the bottle, tap, and cask and they were all phenomenal. Drink it."
"D- I didn't enjoy this one very much. I feel like this is the prime example of a DIPA being too malt forward."
"Jeweled amber tone, sharp clarity, fading orange sunset. Thick meringue tackiness inside the glass. Swaths of lacing, elegant and dense. Sweet candied ginger and grapefruit rinds. Alternating DIPA poles of sweet / bitter. Lingering grapefruit rind and pith, all bitter. Lingering dense malts lurking underneath. Sweet on the uptake, bitter on the downstroke. Savory. The affordable nectar of joe sixpack."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a strong and biting carbonation, wonderful."
"D: Enjoyable, but the alcohol is too strong for too many. I'd buy again and order a second."
"This is a decent to an above average DIPA. Pretty enjoyable all things considered. Worth a try."
"Quite good, as Lagunita's seasonals tend to be. Worth trying if you're a fan of IPAs."
"Alcohol very well-covered. Drinks """too""" easily. Another example of how this brewery uses hops well! Another well-made hoppy brew from Lagunitas at a reasonable price! Very enjoyable - hoppy - but with just enough balance."
"An enjoyable beer, for sure, but not reminiscent of an American DIPA. As far as what I would expect of the style, it isn't quite there. However, on its own, it proves to be a very tasty beer."
"Notes: Well, I really liked the Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, but I flat-out love this Lil' Sumpin Extra! The hop profile is right up my alley, as I love my DIPA's to boast that tropical fruit vibe that just really hits my sweet spot. Highly recommended!"
"overall a really nice dipa from laguinitas...not quite as balanced as hop stoopid but i dont think thats what they were going for...recommended"
"A pleasant hoppification of a base wheat ale, enough to almost obfuscate it entirely - ergo, I always welcome a new DIPA 'round these parts, and especially from an established hop-monger like Lagunitas. This did not disappoint in the least - lovely aroma, flavour, and overall drinking worthiness. Now I'd like to be left alone with the rest of this bomber, thank you very much!"
"Pours out a yellow/orange color into a tulip glass with a very thick, frothy head. Great lacing all the way down. The smell is of a strong hop aroma with an odd cinnimon or nutmeg smell to it. Very interesting. The taste is rather interesting as well. There is the common hop bite up front, not to terribly strong. But it's the back of the pallate that takes a left turn. I can't quite put a word to what happens except that there's like a powdered sugar feeling to the after taste. Very interesting. The powder feel makes the mouthfeel rather dry, another oddity. All these strange characteristics are not bad, and take nothing away from the beer. They just prove there's other ways to make a IIPA even more interesting and better. The alcohol is masked well which makes this a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability: The most session-able DIPA I've ever had. Perhaps more then my favorite by Dogfish Head. Less sweet and more balanced then 90 minute but still lacks a tiny bit of personality."
"Pretty good, like Little Sumpin' Sumpin' more though."
"D- I could do a bomber of this but would prefer to share it, this did not get my juices flowing like the original which is great stuff. The alcohol is a tad high but so what. I need to track down a case of the original. With that said i would not turn this down either. Perhaps I need to try it on tap."
"This drinks really easy though I can't help but feel something feels a little forced or disjointed. Somehow the balance is a touch off, not as outstanding as some other examples, not as dance-all-night worthy. Anyways, still a nice DIPA doing something a little different - I dig that."
"M- Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and very easy drinking for a DIPA. Would def. have again"
"d - more drinkable than many big DIPAs, but still not something you'd want to be drinking all night, not all that complex and/or interesting"
"Overall: I prefer the younger sibling, A little sumpin sumpin, over this brew. Cheers!"
"Thought this beer was very good - I would recommend. I bought my bottle at Blacklick Liquor in Blacklick, OH."
"Drinkability - Extremely so. I didn't even realize how high the ABV was on this beer until after drinking it. For being so high, I felt literally no alcohol warmth - the alcohol is extremely well hidden in the exceptional taste. I wish I would have bought a few more of these."
"Medium bodied, this is one deliciously hoppy, but not bitter beer. Alcohol touches, lots of caramel, and a nice hoppy fruitiness that is never abrasive, quite well done."
"Drinks light and easy, limited a bit by the bitterness and the ABV. Overall, a bit innocuous for the style as nothing detracts, yet nothing stands out too much either. Offers a cryptic date code so unsure of freshness, though their website indicates it is quite fresh, calling it a September seasonal."
"A decent beer but the hop flavor is what stopped me. Not sure what it is but there is a sticky cloyingly sweet flavor and aroma that lowers the enjoyment and drinkability of the beer. I enjoyed A Little Sumpin' Sumpin', but the extra takes a step back in my opinion."
"I will be looking for this quite often, as it is a limited release I hope its done again next year."
"A good value for a DIPA. Pours a brassy/golden color with one inch of white head that had good retention. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma features citrus hops. Also has the sickly sweet smell that I do not like. This beer is bitter, not surprising at 72 IBUs. Citrus notes with a touch of sweet malt. Alcohol heat and flavor in the finish. Another West Coast high alcohol, high IBU ale. Brings nothing new to the table and is a bit mediocre when compared to Russian River or Stone DIPAs. Has a slick and lifeless mouthfeel. Too boozy and bitter for extended drinking. A good bargain if you want to punish your tastebuds with bitterness."
"Drinkability:22oz of this goes down pretty nicely, kind of a harder hitting sumpin sumpin. The sweet finish makes this thing very easy to enjoy."
"Drinkability= Not really a quaffer. I prefer to sip this one. Good flavor, good nose, good looking beer."
"Excellent!"
"this is a very well rounded DIPA strong in all areas and well worth trying if you can find it"
"Cheers!"
"Huge fan of this brews baby brother, another welcome addition to the Lagunitas family. Pours a wonderful orange color with a medium sized, large bubbled, white head. Nice nose as one would expect from Lagunitas, west coasty for sure, juicy citrus bitterness, pine and some grainy wheat. Crisp with an explosive hop bite, zero sign of the 8.74% ABV. Good balance, excellent execution. Layered with super bitterness at the tip of the tongue, fruity and plant-like mid palate, by the end of the quaff the bitterness returns along with a subtle but balancing sweetness and a light whiff of booze rounding the experience out. Another winner, and sure as hell a steal for 4.99, extremely enjoyable and my does that quell the hop fiend...RECOMMENDED. A MUST TRY."
"Lagunitas gives great value, and this is no exception. Sticky mouthfeel. Very good."
"This is a good beer, but it doesn't quite live up to a Little Sumptin' Sumptin'."
"drinkability: It's hard to say this is better than the original. Although I may prefer it but that's because I an a DIPA guy. But the original was the prefect session beer and ahead of its time."
"A Little Sumpin' Extra! Ale was up and down. At first, it seemed to be something special; however, by the end it was a good, but run-of-the-mill, IIPA."
"very well masked high abv at an affordable price. full flavored and interesting. very sessionable. really couldnt ask for much more in terms of drinkability."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a crisp orange with a decent off-white head that lasts and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of citrus hops, sweet malts, sweet fruits and just a hint of spice. The taste is an intriguing take on a hoppy strong ale, like a spiced, fruity DIPA. The beer is medium bodied with just slight alcohol presence. This is a truly unique beer, not one I'd drink regularly, but certainly one worth enjoying from time to time."
"I can't believe it! I finally reviewed something before the amazingly prolific BuckeyeNation (always enjoy his reviews though)!"
"Happy golden amber under a frothy, creamy head that leaves lazy sheets on the glass. Sweet grapefruit aroma...definitely leaning towards the tropical-side of the hop spectrum. Nectarine, pineapple, mango, and melon sticking to a toasted malt backdrop. Deliciously sticky hop flavor. Sweet, juicy, and resinous, the hops take control of the flavor with their flowery lupulin goodness. Not too much from the malt department, really. Lighter than expected, but that helps with the drinkability. Smooth with a lively bitterness. Certainly a fun, happy/hoppy beverage to partake in."
"Overall- This hits my top 5 DIPAs of all time."
"Pours a golden orange with a nice white head. Fantastic lacing - it clung to my glass the whole way down. Nose is of hops and citrus. Taste is loaded with hops and significant bitterness. Definitely not for those that don't enjoy that hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is good - medium bodied, smooth and appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is entirely dependant on whether you enjoy the style - if you do, it's very drinkable."
"Bomber poured into an over sized wine glass. Appearance is a nice orange/copper color with a big 2 finger chunky white head. Big sticky lacing on the glass. Nice smell mainly of orange, mango, a lot of citrus. Taste is full of hops and orange with a very bitter/hop forward finish. I like the bitterness but I can see how some people would not. Not much malt balance at all in this brew. Mouthfeel is nice with a good bit of carbonation. Nice hop burps only 1/2 way through the bomber. I thinks its very drinkable and i blew through this bomber no problem. Again, I don't think the bitterness is for everyone but I really liked it. I think it was just as good or slightly better than the original little sumpin'. This one is a winner in my book, well done Lagunitas. I think I will need to grab another bomber of this while its still around. Recommended for sure to hopheads."
"D: While this beer is smooth, the bitterness is a little over the top."
"Pours a very nice slight hazey golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malt notes, citrus, and pines. The taste is hoppy, bitter, slightly malty, with a very nice touch of citrus/pine notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty DIPA."
"22oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Interesting color for a double IPA. Kind of light compared to what I'm used to seeing...sort of dark yellowish. A careless, aggressive pour left a huge, thick creamy head, eventually settling into a small pool of suds. Some lacing on the glass but not too much. The aroma...wow, it's like a hop punch in the face and I like it. Real heavy hoppy aroma that I could smell before actually taking a whiff of it. Noticeable grapefruit citrus presence as well. The taste is a hop bomb. Lots of tasty hoppiness hits immediately, then gives way to the bitter citrus. Not a whole lot of balance here, but it's quite tasty. It's got a light mouthfeel for the style and goes down real easy. An enjoyable beer for hopheads like myself."
"This is a very tasty beer and would be an especially good choice for someone who isn't wild about hop bitterness but loves hop flavor. It's not as bitter as Hop Stoopid, and has more citrus flavor as opposed to the huge resiny, herbal flavors. It's very juicy, and just full of flavor. This is a big hoppy beer that you could actually session. Very good, and if not for the alcohol bite it would be outstanding."
"D - High ABV, but decently tasty and a very reasonably priced IIPA."
"This ranks up there with the best DIPA's ever. It won't blow away those that want complete hop destruction but it still packs a huge punch. Once again the crew at Lagunitas knocks it out of the park and still manages to keep their prices within reason. Thank you!!"
"This deal's solid. I've been gravitating away from DIPAs in order to explore different styles and to sharpen the palate, but I enjoyed this. Price isn't bad, either. As a kicker, it drinks quite easily for the octane."
"Reminded me of an orange flavored weizenbock."
"M&D - what a great job of keeping the great DIPA pine/grapefruit/floral flavors and yet having it so drinkable, so smooth, so balance, well done Lagunitas. if only hop profiles were cellarable, i would store several of these"
"D. Alcohol is masked pretty well, I could drink a few of these."
"As for drinkability, yes there is a decent alcohol presence, but all the other flavors are big enough to balance this and is is bitter enough that any sweetness fatigue is over ome and leaves the tongue crying for more. I think my tongue is a masochist."
"Notes: I can not believe that this beer has brought me back to my true love,not Brown Ales which I cut my teeth on or Tripels which I had a fling with,but Double IPA's. I love this style and this beer is above average. Perhaps it is not great yet it does it all too well. I get the sweetness,the bitterness and the hop kick with a good ABV to boot."
"Lagunitas did a nice job with this one. They usually do. I was a little disappointed with the Correction Ale release, but this one's substantially better. It's good stuff. It's more consistent with what I look in DIPAs (more hoppy, less malty) and is overall a very good beer. It'd be slightly better with less alcohol prominence and no toasted malt flavor. Neither are glaring problems here, but they're noted. Very solid DIPA all-around. Worth checking out."
"This came highly recommended from the staff at Martys in Newton. this is a good looking beer, showing a glowing orange color, with a finger of white heading. Smell of hops, wheat and some lighter stone fruits. Flavor is very hop forward in the beginning, but ends with the wheat somewhere in the mix. Not really too bitter, more of a decent mix between bitter and sweet. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy, and some notes of alcohol make their way through. I had no issue clearing off the bottle, however I am not sure I would get it again. Final thoughts are that this beer is pretty good, although not nearly as much as the Martys staff said. I was not the least bit impressed by the Lil Sumpin Sumpin available in six packs. This is an improvement, but still nothing to go hunting down. I am more of a fan of the Hop Stoopid. Anyway, give it a try, and put some extra sharp cheddar next to it."
"Delicious, dry DIPA with a fruity hop character. The beer pours bright and golden with a creamy slightly off-white head. There's good head retention and lacing. The aroma has a touch of alcohol as its only very slight downside. Otherwise, it's bright and fruity with hops. It smells like mangoes, raspberries and lemons. There's a caramel malt note in there, but it's buried beneath handfuls of hops. The flavor is dry, not quite Pliny-level dry but still excellent. The grain tastes fresh and clean and contributes just the right amount of sweetness. I imagine this beer has some wheat in it, like its little brother, but it's not very noticeable except at the first moment of flavor and possibly a touch in the aroma, just a whiff of bread. I'm really trying to find it, though. Anyway, the hops are the star. They're big, bright and fruity. There's a touch of pine resin in the flavor, but it's still mostly tropical fruits and berries. The bitterness level is excellent and stays on the palate quite pleasantly."
"Spotless white head, look scrubbed clean, crests at about one finger, assorted bubble sizes, steady dissolve leaving an above average amount of lacing stuck to the glass sides. A touch lighter and clearer than expected, a kind of sub bleached yellow to pumpkin orange in hue, easily transparent. The nose is drenched in pink grapefruit, lime and tangerine juice, pungently sweet with pine oil, scone crumbs, the apricot, peach fruit too friendly to relent and take on tart pineapple notes, difficult to tease out any chocolate or toffee type stuff. Full-bodied, the carbonation is fine and sticks the tongue rather than swirl, this in large part due to the overt heaviness and tactile cling. Not as out-and-out sweet as the nose, however, there's no less impressiveness in the tangerine, lime, pink grapefruit, just the dominance among them shifted a bit. Pine, ginger and more of a floral dimension although that is too delicate to thrive amidst the bitter grassiness which comes to the fore at the end. Powdered milk chocolate has additional staying power and there's a punch of carob as well. Not that much breadiness, if anything rough baker's dough. Apricot, nectarine, golden raisin, honeydew melon fruit flavors. Plays up its strengths from start to finish and doesn't make much attempt at answering the critics beforehand."
"D- I guess this beer isn't bad as far as """drinkablity", it wasn't a chore to finish the bomber by any means. It's refreshing, light and clean, if that what your looking for this is the beer. As far as buyability it was $4.75 for a bomber so its pretty cheap, but I woulndn't get another one."
"A decent beer in it's own right, but to put the Sumpin Sumpin tag on this it leaves a little to be desired for me."
"D: An outstanding DIPA from Lagunitas, where can you get a DIPA this good for under $4.50 anymore, nowhere, except the Elder, but you only get 500 mL. Lagunitas has certainly been impressing me lately."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a Unibroue tulip. Beautiful, fluffy, lingering white head and some nice lacing. Smell of grapefruit and pine with some sweet malt background. Sweetness comes forward more as the beer warms a bit. I'd love to say that the beer is balanced, but I think that in a way its perfectly out of balance. You don't name a beer Sumpin' extra if its perfectly balanced. That said, Sumpin' sumpin' is my beer of the year for 2009 and Sumpin' extra was not one ounce of a let down."
"Overall- i liked the regular lil sumpin ale better than this one. not to shabby tho."
"D- This is a very good IIPA. I am not sure if I had tempered expectations, but it definetly is alot better than I thought it was going to be. I am not known to drink a bunch of these, but I would seek this out for sure."
"D - Too drinkable, because that ABV would have you on your back pretty quickly. Great stuff."
"D - Great overall. Nice beer."
"D: Very drinkable DIPA for sure. Especially for something created off the west coast. Don't get me wrong, I like some heavily hopped brews but sometimes it goes to far (or sometimes way too often). DIPAs and IPAs are flooding the shelves, so its nice to see a West Coast brewery making a DIPA that can be consumed easily and is still enjoyable. It doesn't wreck the palate, just challenges it a bit. Lagunitas may come up short at times but their beers are almost always good. Dig this one. They should put it into rotation for sure."
"D: Very drinkable, the high ABV is not apparent. Lagunitas continues to absolutely impress."
"Taste is just wonderful, very much like the smell, very sweet with a slightly bitter finish. A bit dry as well which just makes you want to sip some more. Feels dense and creamy, mild carbonation. At $4.99 here in Ohio this is damn hard to beat. I plan on buying as many as I can find. This is every bit as good as DIPA's at twice the price. How does Lagunitas do it?"
"The flavor starts neutral, then a bitterness builds that is balanced with lots of juicy hops. Pears, kumquats, mildly pine, a great tropical mix what a hint of white pepper. Definitely a respectable hop monster here, with a nice light body bolstered by a smooth medium-high carbonation. A touch of earthiness on the finish. Not quite the best of the best, but a great showcase of the intense fruitiness hops can bring a beer in this age. A sticky finish, slightly sappy, limits drinkability a bit, but this brew displays many desirable characteristics. Lagunitas continues to show they are a force to be reckoned in both qualtiy and everyday accessibility."
"M + D: Just enough carbonation to complement the body, which has a bit of oomph to it, though not overly heavy. It goes down quite easily to begin, but I found it to be more slow going after the halfway point. A bit of balance, I suppose. Nicely done, and worth getting another!"
"D- Really nice hoppy aroma and flavor. Is it better than regular 'Lil Sumpin Sumpin'? I don't know, but I do know that I liked them both quite a bit :)"
"Another quality IPA from the folks at Lagunitas. Drinkability is great, alcohol is hidden very well possibly too well. Extremely easy to drink and rather hard not to enjoy."
"-Bye"
"Drinkability is exquisitely dangerous. No, nada, nil, none, absolute zero Kelvin, taste of alcohol, so watch it!"
"Drinkability: There seemed to be a lot of hype around this beer, and honestly I don't get it. This is a good IIPA and nothing more. This is not a hop bomb, but it'll stave off the typical hop-head for a while. For the price ($4.29 per bomber), this is worth a try."
"One of the better beers I have had from lagunitas. Big yet not too boozy, and hoppy but not too bitter."
"D- A nice, tight, double IPA. Drinks very nicely for the ABV and is pretty memorable as well. A fantastic beer for the price."
"Well just by looking at the numbers, you can tell I think that this an average Imperial IPA. Color was a slightly hazy, golden straw. Not much head or retention. A typical hop aroma and flavor. Body?, yup, just about what you expect. Drinkability is what Imperial IPAs are expected be at, given the strength and tongue numbing aspects of the style. Not a bad beer, I'll have it again, but it seems to represent what Lagunitas has become. I used to look forward to trying new brews from them, but lately they just seem to be going through the motions."
"D: This was a fantastic DIPA. I wish the nose was a hint stronger, but otherwise this is very nice. I could definitely drink a few of these, which could be dangerous at 8.7% ABV. It is too bad this is a limited brew. I should go buy a ton more. I hope they release it again next year."
"Like most sequels, this one came off as bigger and bolder, but ultimately just a tad less satisfying than the original. Same awesome hop character here, but the bigger ABV did make the feel and drinkibility just a bit tougher. 22 oz was definitely enough for me this go around. Hop lovers still need to check this one out though."
"A clear gold colored body was attractive, and the head atop was modest but stable. Carbonation appeared relatively light. The smell was a hop symphony that was bold and beautiful. Some caramel malt smell was poking through under the strong hop presence. The taste was citric grapefruit pith and bitter herbs with a honey-pineapple like sweetness backing it up. This was definitely a wet dream for a hophead like me. Unabashed DIPA goodness abounded in each sip, with the bitter finish taking no prisoners. This is what Maximus should have been all along. Felt a bit runny in the mouth with not much coating action, but that led naturally to more drinking. Drinkability off the charts for any hop lover."
"D: Very, I suppose. But not really my style. The flavor doesn't WOW me enough for how far it is out of what I normally drink. But is doesn't taste like the ABV is it."
"How many different Double IPA's does Lagunitas make? I'd like to get them all side by side to compare. This one is good. A little less strong and less hoppy than some of their others so it can be drank in somewhat larger quanties, at somewhat earlier hours and can be shared with the less adventurous. It has a very interesting aroma that's distinctly different than other IPA's. Good carbonation with good lacing. It's a good one; i just wish i could understand their brands."
"a wonderful beer - if you see it, drink it."
"Note-I'm beginning to get really impressed with the Lagunitas' seasonal offerings. They are very affordable and top-notch quality. It seems like they are banging out winners here at an astonishing pace. Can't wait for the next one!"
"Not surprisingly, the hops don't stop in the aroma--not by a long shot. Lots of tangy citrus and resinous pine on the front, followed by the aforementioned tropical fruits that get a dose of sweetness from the malts on the finish. Just the right amount of bitterness, but the hop flavor is where it's at with this IIPA. Mouthfeel is no slouch, either, with a medium body packing a tight, bubbly carbonation level. Not too syrupy or heavy on the palate, just the way I like 'em. Great job on the Little Sumpin' lineup, Lagunitas...two-for-two in my book!"
"Goes down very smooth; not as overpowering and alcoholic as other DIPAs. Nice one-off from Lagunitas."
"I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good IPA, and you can't beat the price."
"Minty, piney hop-dominated aroma and flavor... Menthol notes with lemon zest and lime essence also present... Interesting stuff with a powerful minty hop backbone..."
"drinkability - doesn't get better than this. I could drink this all night."
"D - Certaily enjoyed it, but wouldn't want to have a second. I would recommend it, but won't be putting it in my regular rotation."
"M/D - Medium-bodied and crisp, and incredibly drinkable, even dangerously so. This beer is awesome."
"M/ O - Med to chewy mouthfeel. Not as bitter as aroma would hint at. Nice, big hop aroma and flavor but drinkable and plenty of balance for style. Almost b/t IPA and IIPA."
"Toasted wheat bread and metallic hops up front. Sweet fruity malts and juicy citric hops follow. Lots of pulpy orange and grapefruit flavors. Pineapple. Grassy, resinous hop bitterness in the background. More sweet, rummy fruit, before a dryish, bitter finish. Pretty good. Medium-full body with a rather lively feel. I might like the regular version more, but this is still pretty tasty!"
"Apricot and red grape hoppy flavors are most noticeable at first, followed by a wheat tang and heavy grapefruit. Not overly bitter, but high on hop flavor, flaunting and showcasing them even. Great brew, never guessed it clocked in at nearly 9%."
"D - Nicely balanced. Not too bitter or sweet like other DIPA's. This one goes down too easy for 9%."
"Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. This is very easy to drink, and very enjoyable."
"Easy to drink, a little too easy for almost 9% abv!"
"This is super fresh with hop flavors and aromas. So delicious. Going to cellar one for a few years and see what happens."
"This is a very drinkable beer, I'm just not sure that it fits in the category it was put in. Appearance is good, looks more like a standard IPA slightly oily with a well carbonated base. Smell and taste are docked only because they are quite weak if this is the correct style. They are very good with nice hoppiness and grapefruitiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both on par- oily feel with lots of loose carbonation."
"Overall- Delicious! a highly drinkable and buttery smooth DIPA!!"
"It's priced right and is completely enjoyable. My only knock is that it doesn't deviate much from many of Lagunitas' hoppy offerings (see: Hop Stoopid, Maximus, and this one's little bro, among others)."
"D - Very drinkable for a DIPA. Pretty Solid brew. Definitely worth checking out."
"Bomber bottle, no freshness info. Pours lightly hazed, lighter amber, with a golden hue. Long lasting eggshell head, gobs of fine sheeting and lace, nice looking beer. Lucious tropical fruit nose, with notes of melon, spiced up hops and pinapple. Tasty, fruity, hoppy, all around quality DIPA. A bargain at $4.99/bomber. Got to love a brewery that keeps putting out new and quite worthy brews at reasonable prices. Heck they even quote Woody Guthrie on the label. Nice job here. Well worth a try, especially for Cali. DIPA lovers"
"If you hav't had this yet, pick one up. It's truly a little sumpin' extra!"
"Since the original Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is probably my most favorite new beer of the year, I had to try its big brother. Very similar in taste and drinkability, I wish I could have had them side by side to better determine any differences. Great stuff."
"This beer looks great with a very light golden color, great clarity and a large white head. The hop aroma is nice with floral, fruity and piney notes but it might be a bit reserved compared to some other DIPAs in its area. The flavor is very nice with some citrusy hop flavor at the start and an increasing citrusy bitterness through the finish. It takes quite some time for it to die down; even after your mouth is empty. The 8.74% alcohol remains well hidden throughout the experience. The mouthfeel is creamy and silky though maybe a bit thin with a low to moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles. There's some decent lacing left behind. This is a nice beer with lots of character."
"I picked up this bomber at Grapes of Mirth in Columbus, about $5. Clear, pale copper colored, very thick and wet frothy head that laces in large clumps. The smell is pure Lagunitas IPA, the IPA's from this brewery are so solid. The hops display soft grapefruit aromas and a little orange, near perfect for a west coast DIPA. It tastes a little burning, fresh resin squeezed right from the cones. I get a strong pungent citrus bite with each sip, overwhelmingly good. This is what a DIPA should be, you can tell that there's extra malt based on body but the balance is appropriately hop-centric. Wow this is good stuff."
"I don't want to keep buying the same beer disguised in a different label. It's a wee bit different than Hop Stoopid, but that's a phrase I attribute more to Highland Brewery in Asheville than Lagunitas in Sonoma County. Bottom line: if I want a little sumpin' from Lagunitas, I'll stick with Hop Stoopid."
"Received a bottle of this for my birthday from neighbors. Pours a rich amber color with a strong head. Very sweet smell, likely a touch of alcohol and the malt. Very sticky taste - slightly piney, sticky, a very rich beer and very well-balanced. Sticky mouthfeel that doesn't want to leave the mouth. Very good beer."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is an excellent brew, yet another great offering from an underrated Lagunitas. Well done!"
"Pours a clear amber with clumpy, clingy white head. Smell: big floral, tropical fruit, on a sweet lightly toasted background. Taste: lots of pineapple, grapefruit, cantaloupe. Feel is fluffy with a fruity hop soaked finish. This was really good, want more!"
"Very nice beer, but it is a little hot and not quite as good as a Lil Sumpin Sumpin. I'm not really sure why this beer was necessary given that the regular version was already over 7% abv. The extra alcohol just detracts in my opinion- bring back Lil Sumpin Sumpin! In any case, this is still quite good. Pours dark golden with a thin white head and very nice lacing. Tangy smell of yeast and wheat with some tropical fruits and alcohol. Tastes somewhat similar, but with a deeeper and longer flavor than suggested in the nose, and a long bitterness as well to balance the tropical fruit. Moderately sweet, somewhat tangy, bitter finish, and alcohol throughout. Big beer and not all that smooth, but quite bitter and with less alcohol very refreshing. As is, there is a nice crisp bitterness. Quite good, but sometimes less is more. Lil Sumpin Sumpin was one of my favorite beers of summer."
"D= pretty good. Really good beer. Lagunitas has really started to please me. This doesn't let down"
"D: Damn good. I could easily go through a couple bottles in a night. Just as enjoyable as the original."
" Sweet and mellow hop bitterness invades the palate and then everything goes complex. The sweetness comes forward and the bitter taste settles down and the malt sweetness is awesome. A little more balanced than other DIPAs but at the same time lighter and with a great complexity. The mouth feel is thick and concentrated. Overall a very good DIPA."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis, MN. Poured a cloudy, light orange body with an off-white head of foam. Aroma was dominated by piney aromatic hops. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the flavors again were dominated by spicy, piney hops that had a long lasting finish. Definitely not balanced, but good drinking if you are a hophead."
"Will purchase again."
"*NB - I prefer the regular Little Sumpin Sumpin"
"Medium body with a nice bitter earthy hop character. Citrus notes are there but not as prominent as in the aroma. Very dry and chewy with a lot of bitterness up front. The dry piny hops are countered by a sweet caramel malt backbone. Slight citrus peel and grapefruit but these flavors are subtle and are overtaken by by earthy piny bitterness. The alcohol is pretty well hidden with a bone dry finish. Saying all of this I LOVE the biting bitterness that dominates and lasts throughout."
"Lots of carbonation blast at your tongue to help slide this guy along. It really reminds me of a pilsner in looks and body profile. The soft flavors allow for a real drinkable beer. If it weren't for the 8.74% I would say this would be an awesome session beer."
"overall impression- great nose, very easy to drink, was expecting a much fuller, more complex beer and was a little disappointed"
"D - Outstanding drinkability. Bitter & spicy from start to finish. Again, this beer is remarkably tasty. But take caution - if the alcohol doesn't get you, the hops surely will."
"drinkability is scary with the almost 9%abv - another winner from lagunitas"
"Overall another excellent beer from Lagunitas. However, they all seem to be somewhat similar. Maybe it's a hop contract or their proprietary yeast strain. Either way, they're still great beers."
"Overall this is another great hoppy offering from Lagunitas and all I have to say is keep up the good work."
"Taste almost as good as it smells. Loads of the aforementioned hop flavors, with lots of sweet malts. Getting some nice candied sugar, caramel, and alcohol flavors. Mouthfeel is a little slick, but it coats the tongue nicely, and goes down way to easy. Another amazing, affordable brew from one of my favorite breweries."
"D: I'm drinking this plenty fast, thanks to the relatively low bitterness on the finish, but the alcohol that appears does make this a bit of a chore."
"A solid Dbl. IPA and what I'd call a close cousin to Hop Stoopid and drinkable all the same."
"Oh so very drinkable, I could drink this forever. If you have a chance to pick it up do it, you will not regret it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth with a little bit of residual sweetness. The bomber is fairly easy to take down and I definitely appreciate the price as compared to other options. A tasty, hoppy brew that I will grab again if the mood strikes and it's still around."
"D: Is this really a DIPA? It tastes like one, but it's fairly balanced and even slightly on the maltier side, so I don't know where I'd put it. Well-hidden bitterness, and it's a great value at $4.50 a bomber. I'd buy this again."
"Another HR by a great brewery. Love this stuff, and taste speaks louder than words, Definitely a must try IMO.Amazing thay can make a brew like this and it's different than Hop Stoopid. Strangely the only brew that I don't like is their IPA: Didn't like it one bit. This one is a winner without going into a 1000 word essay."
"big citrus and resiny pine hops dominate but are balanced by a strong malt backround.smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation make this easy drinking.really an awesome late summer beer."
"Hazed amber body. Thin cap of tight white froth. Lacing is quite full. Love the pineapple hop aroma in this beer. A little grapefruit and a little nectarine too. Nice tropical hop nose. Tropical notes translate nicely over to the nose with an additional twist of a smoky mary jane like flavor. Juicy malt flavors. The base malt is nicely carmelized. And the bitterness is pretty subdued and clean. Alcohol is held in check nicely. This is a solid DIPA. Not to be unexpected from a brewery like Lagunitas."
"22 oz bottle poured into a stemless red wine glass. Light copper color with one inch off white head. Lacing is good. Nice citrus hoppy smell with a hint of maltiness. Very hop forward on the palate and then malt on the back end. Feels good in the mouth, not to thick, not too heavy. I like this beer and will drink again if I see it in my local. Picked it up for $4.99 for the 22 oz at my local in Harford County MD."
"Lagunitas seems to make one great beer after another, and this is no exception."
"D- easy to finish. not much left of the wheat side of this. check this one out, the price is certainly right."
"and.."
"I love that Lagunitas went out and tweeked the original recipe. I prefer the original version as it is less sweet, but this was still a good beer. Nothing beats a truly fresh DIPA."
"Pours an orangish brown with a creamy white head. Excellent lacing and retention. Nose has fresh hops, sweet candy malts and a touch of booze. Taste has big floral hops and fruity malts. Great balance. Body is a bit thin, but drinks well. Nice IPA from Lagunitas, a notch above Hop Stoopid."
"D: An alcoholic air at the end is the only thing that detracts from this DIPA. I highly recommend this brew."
"Very easy drinking. Hesitant to put a 5 on it...but I did."
"This one is not going to last long at all! What a bargain at less than $5 a bomber too."
"Another exceptionally fine hoppy IPA from Lagunitas."
"Great to see Lagunitas continue to launch new limited edition brews out.Poured into a imperial nonic a deep burnt orange color with a large fluffy head that takes awhile to come down,wow what fresh hoppy aromas in the nose!A mix of grapefruit,tangerine, melon,and grass really come out,I can smell it a foot and a half away.Sad to say the flavors are not as a big of a hit as the aromas to me,somewhat leathery with pine resin and dark fruit,a sweetish alcohol presence is prevelent as well.To me it seems a little more alcoholic than it is,its got alot of things going for it but just misses on a few things."
"D: Overall a pretty good brew. Definitely worth trying."
"22oz bomber $4.49. Nice orange color, good head, looks a lot like Hop Stoopid. The smell is piney and hoppy and the taste is quite hoppy as well. This is a fine DIPA but to be honest it really lacks the citrus juiciness that Little Sumpin' Sumpin' had. Also the mouthfeel is a lot thicker (obviously) and I don't like that. For my money I would buy Little Sumpin' Sumpin' but if you want a hoppy DIPA for cheap this fits the bill."
"Nice effort. As an aside, I would love to know how Lagunitas makes such flavorful beers at a VERY reasonable price!"
"Reminds me alot of Sculpin... DON'T FLOG ME!!! But seriously.. off the cuff.. this one has some interesting hoppiness that doesn't come around that often... and Sculpin is certainly in that category."
