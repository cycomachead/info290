This beer is truly abrasive, while it highlights all the positive characteristics of a well composed IIPA. Its versatile in taste, while it provides a merciless bitterness, wrapped up by citraic fruits and honeyed malts.","aleigator","Tuesday at 11:21 AM"

That balance alone would make a great IPA, but there is an earthy quality as well. One reviewer described it as herbal. It works wonderfully adding flavor and complexity to an already great beer.

4.46,-1.5,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, what a fantastic beer to start your night with.  Actually, we started and ended our night with pours of Abrasive at the new Surly brewpub (which is gorgeous, by the way).  This was actually kind of an emotional experience for us.  We had visited Minneapolis a few weeks prior to this trip, but unfortunately were unable to get over to Surly.  Very sad.  We happened to get a chance for a second trip to Minneapolis for work, and were so thankful for the opportunity to make time during this return visit.  If we’re not mistaken, the day we arrived at the brewpub was their annual release day for Abrasive; a beer that has been ever elusive for us, at least for the past few years.  It was such a nice surprise to see it one tap, and we had to go for it.  Thus, the two glasses a piece.  What a journey the beer itself is.  The nose is sweet and warming simultaneously, making that first sip irresistible joy.  It shocks you with intense citric and grapefruit bitterness, then the sweetness hits.  Finally, the booze and chemicals wash you away for this amazingly balanced finale.  This is the best DIPA we’ve had in recent memory, and it is sips uniquely as a true east/west hybrid on the transition from the front of the mouth to the back.  We said it once, and we’ll say it again…BOOM.","TheBrewo","Feb 09, 2015"

A lot of fantastic ales competing out here, no doubt. ABV on Abrasive is substantiate to get you going well on any pre-flight for the night.

Wow the smell bright orange grapefruit citrus with a dank balance and a slight peachy yeast aroma. The taste hits all the aromas perfectly balanced not overly sweet bitter or citrus but does lean toward the citrus side. The taste is near perfect but I do think Pliny and ht are slightly deeper and fuller. The mouthfeel is crisp and full and you want to keep going back to the well for another.

I find it somewhere in between a citrus and pine bomb. Taste is fruity and tasty upfront with some malt and pine in between and then a huge hop bomb aftertaste and pretty dry. I also get a little candyish pez type taste. Almost reminds me of Palate Wrecker but with more fruit characteristics. Mouthfeel is semi carbonated and bitter rolling off the palate. Overall this is an excellent DIPA but not quite World Class in my opinion. As it warms it really shines. I would definitely seek this out and love to try one that's fresh as hell to better compare. Even so, another great one from Surly.","rjp217","0"

This feels so much like a West Coast IPA or a Midwestern hoppy variety in so many respects, but it blows most offerings in the country out of the water. Refreshing, complex, food friendly, and rewarding stuff. At the low price and decent availability, I wonder if I should just stick to getting more of these from now on than any other beer of its type not in my distro. I really wish this were year-round.

Definitely a hop forward beer with tastes much like the nose. I'm surprised when I'm thinking critically about the beer that I am getting the malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer but there is a really nice balance with the malts I really never noticed before for this IIPA. I don't want to overstate the malts. really not balanced but there are some in the background that are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is thicker than most IIPAs but this really makes it a treat.

4.56,0.7,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this on cask at 3Floyds in early/mid 2013. Fantastic DIPA anyway, cask puts it over the edge. Bubbly/soapy two finger white head, beer was hazy dark straw color. Great nose of hops but also mellowed as all cask beers are. Phenomenal flavor, still hoppy and balanced by malt, but smoothed over by the cask. Mouth feel was very similar to taste. A rare treat.","tsauce2","Sep 30, 2013"

4.63,2.2,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,"One pint can poured into my Duvel glass. A rich golden honey body has a consistent haze to it. I get only about one inch of head that fades in just a couple of minutes. Head is a soft beige in color. Only edges of lace are left behind. Nose is full of orange rind and marmalade. Softly fragrant but very nice. With first sip I am really taken by how dry this beer is. Based on the nose I was really expecting something a little more citrus based and maybe a bit sweater. Not that I am complaining but the nose threw me off. The hop profile is nicely bitter and extremely dry. There is a twinge of lemon zest on the on the back end of the palate. This beer is not heavy at all and would go wonderfully with some stinky blue cheese. Dryness lingers on the mouthfeel but is just wonderful. A very nice break from all the more sweet IPAs out there lately.","SPLITGRIN","May 01, 2013"

I can see why it continues to receive 100% score from people and it's right up at the top...even better than Hopslam at the elite level. It's all about the citrus and bitterness flavor. If you prefer a malt-forward or sorta """barleywine""" DIPA, don't waste your time trying this beer. Okay, do try this beer if you haven't done so because it has the power to convert you!

In the realm of Pliny's, Hopslams, Heady Toppers, Pure Hoppiness and the like, does this beer hold up? It's in the conversation, but ultimately I couldn't say i'd put this beer ahead of any of those (my old ratings aside)... but if its a step down from those it is a very minor one. In the end, there is something to be said for a beer that delivers exactly what it promises.","mechamifune","Apr 11, 2013"
4.21,-7.1,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Overall I enjoyed this but sadly not as much as it's lighter cousin Furious. I don't think over a month is a death sentence for a DIPA but maybe a fresher example would have yielded a more impressive aroma. While this is a world class example of the style, I still found the price point a bit high. The flavor profile is super amazing, but nothing that hasn't been done before. With all the new hop styles available it seems you need to reinvent yourself to be continuously impressive to induce repeat purchases. If it was easier to get I would probably purchase again but for close to half the cost, Furious is more drinkable and sessionable and probably easier to get on the daily.","claspada","Apr 11, 2013"

It definitely hides its 9% ABV very well and is a delectable gobletful of citrus, tropical fruit and pine bitterness. If you're a huge hophead, this is a fantastic example of a beer you'll give all 5's to. For me, I think it could be a little bit more malty to back up the hops and it'd meet my preferences for a more balanced DIPA that I've come to love- such as Pliny the Elder and this year's Hopslam- both of which are on the sweeter side to go along with their hopforwardness. I would definitely get it every year as long as I live near Minnesota. (4.75)","Stevedore","Apr 08, 2013"

4.23,-6.6,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"finally, an abrasive in my glass! been reading about this one forever, so nice to finally get the chance to indulge. and an indulgence this is! pours a sleek reddish orange color with some haze and a couple inches of impenetrable white head. the nose is way way more fruity than I anticipated, super juice fresh squeezed hop complexion, with some pine and definitely an acidic citrus element, but I get a lot more berry and even passionfruit in this. some lighter American 2 row and caramel malts round it out. the flavor is more tropical than deciduous in the fruit department, but still pungently fruity. bitterness doesn't even come in until the finish, which makes this a really unique double ipa. the alcohol is almost entirely invisible until the beer warms up, and even then isn't punishing by any stretch. the mouthfeel is the weakest link, not bad, but a little more malt body might balance this out little better. I feel like it needs a bigger platform to stand out. carbonation is right on though, and it makes the grapefruit and other citrus hops characters come out a little more. id love to know what hops are used in this, its really different. Maybe not the most perfect example of the style out there, but you don't get to be a 100 on BA in this category by accident. Worthy of my anticipation, this is a stellar beer. I can still name a handful of others id draft higher, but this is awesome!","StonedTrippin","Apr 08, 2013"

I don't think it is quite as good as some of the top-shelf, hop-forward DIPAs like PtE (which while dry still has some malt slickness to it), Hopslam (also dry from the honey but still with more heft than Abrasive), or Maharaja (which has come off as a little sweet in the past but was great this year). If they ramped up the mouthfeel a tad to give a little more body, this would be a top 10 DIPA. Still a great beer and definitely worth seeking out.","argock","Apr 07, 2013"

The only main difference I find in these two is the Furious shows off the citrus characteristics a bit better whereas Abrasive is a bit more earthy and herbal which is a bit confusing since Furious uses Amarillo and Simcoe hops which are generally more earthy and Abrasive uses Citra (which is obviously more citrusy) and Warrior...Maybe I'm overthinking this and should just enjoy the beer.

4.57,0.9,4,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"O: While it obviously could be fresher, drinking 3 months old), you can tell this is a very excellent DIPA. I would say that the name Abrasive though is pretty fitting as the beer doesn't shy away from pounding your face with hops. That being said, it is well balanced, though a bit double headed. A nice balance between very tropical sweets and bitter citrus's. Very nice drinking beer as well, though I would say it is the slightest bit more harsh that Heady, the transition/blend not being as smooth, & the hops are more in your face and I don't quite get the same hop complexity I find in a Heady, also not quite as strong IBU it feels. (Again, could be the age... ) Looking forward to trying this fresh one day though and it certainly doesn't fade in the shadow of other hyped DIPA's..","4ster","Mar 22, 2013"

4.52,-0.2,4,4.5,4.75,4,4.5,"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the beer was a light copper color with a slight white head. It left acceptable lacing and retention in the glass. A big floral citrus aroma jumped from the glass, awakening the sense of smell. In the front, notes of peach, pineapple, apple came from the hops. A pleasant maltiness laid in the background as to not allow the hops to be overwhelming. The hops notes seem to unify in the end to a megahop that resembles grapefruit at its base in the aftertaste. Pleasantly warming notes are allowed to linger with thick texture helping the sensation to cling to the back of the throat. This is an excellent example of the style that I could drink any time.","JohnnyHopps","Feb 28, 2013"

The nose is a grapefruit smashed into the can, really a wonderful smell, and if i get this up front I generally l know I'll love the beer. The taste really follows the nose, lots of citrus, and a ton on hops right up front. Not quite as balanced as HT, and a little more bitter, this one is very close in taste profile, but I think Abrasive has more citrus hits. This is a great brew from start to finish, and it's a little sad when you hit your last sip out of your last can. If this was available all the time it would always be in my fridge as would HT, sitting side by side where they would belong. 15 bucks a 4 pk isn't exactly cheap either, but as always france 44 gives you fresh stuff.","nc41","Dec 25, 2012"

Finishes clean and dry. Fairly fully bodied, moderate carbonation, slick and smooth on the palate. Abrasive is one of my personal favorite DIPA's. Not overly sweet, complex, abundant flavor, just the right amount of hop bitterness, and a pleasantly dry finish. Truly world-class.","chanokokoro","Nov 23, 2012"
4.77,5.3,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"I just finished enjoying a 2012 Abrasive from a can that was brewed nine days ago. I poured the contents into a pint glass straight out of the fridge at around forty degrees. The beer was pale orange in appearance with average carbonation and a slight slight haze, but still transparent with a single finger of head. Straight off the pour I could smell the hop aroma before I even put the glass up to my nose, very citrus forward with a malt presence. The first sip was straight grapefruit followed by the entire spectrum of citrus flavors, strong malt presence quickly balanced out the strong hop rush that blew my socks off. The sides of my tongue were left with a lingering bitterness, not unpleasant just enough to let you know the hops were still there. The alcohol was hidden deep in this beer and even after it warmed up I could not taste any heat through the hops. The mouth feel was just what I look for in an IPA, it has some body but not too much so that it was not refreshing. Even though this beer comes in at 9% ABV I had no second thoughts about going to the fridge and pouring a second after I slugged down the first. Overall Abrasive is an amazing beer and definitely lives up to the hype, I can't believe I only bought one four pack. I tend to be promiscuous with my beers, but if I ever had to settle down I probably could with this beer.","HANGOVER","Nov 21, 2012"

There is some candy corn, maple syrup, Taste is spicy, sweet, fruit punch, floral and herbal hoppy, loaded with honey, mint, butterscotch. Body is chewy, bitter, thick. Definitely not a hop bomb.

The aroma is full of juicy citrus hops, with noticeable (yet not distracting) caramel malts in the back. The taste is, yet, another knockout for Surly in the IPA department. The taste is very heavy on the pine and citrus hops, with light caramel malts in the background. The finish is fantastic, with a perfect amount of hop bitterness (read: a lot) lingering on the tongue long after taking a sip. A hophead's delight. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's mouth-coating and """weighty", yet goes down very easily. The dirnkability is very good. Overall, it's yet another superlative IPA from Surly. As soon as I get a better job, Merwin Liquors has to watch out, as I'll be getting all Surly on their online store.","shand","Mar 19, 2012"

Earthy hop aromas with some caramel malt a bit of grass. Some grapefruit and melon. Taste is initially quite citrusy. A blast of orange, lemon zest, grapefruit at first. Nice grass and pine resin...pretty dank flavors here. Kinda reminds me of Maharaja. Finishes bitter with a lot of caramel malt. A bit of alcohol burn in the finish.

The grapefruit bitterness is there but leaves quickly and doesn't linger on my tongue it is followed up by a malty sweetness. There is also some fruit flavor like orange/tangerine or some other sweet fruit, last there is a good piny flavor to it as well. It has a medium/thin mouthfeel but when compared to others in the style I find it a little too thin for me, the carbonation is on point.

Smell is super hoppy: citrus zest/grapefruit, pine, and some earthy herbal aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, pine, and herbal hops, grapefruit, and a malt backbone on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good and very hoppy DIPA.

The flavors are smooth, mildly bitter citrusy hops once again. The orange, tangerine, and apricot marmalade are superb. This beer drinks ultimately smooth and the alcohol isn't noticeable whatsoever.

5,10.4,5,5,5,5,5,"I've been hoping for an opportunity to try some beers from Surly for some time, and this one hit it out of the park for me. Golden peach color with a tight white head. Faintly sweet and floral in the nose. Perfectly balanced big hops punch up front, with a honey sweetness playing off the hops bittering. No alcohol notes, other than a little pepper at the finish. Wonderfully smooth for a DIPA. I would put this head-to-head with Hopslam.","Brent","Beers"

There was more head retention that lingered on the sides of the glass as I drank it. The smell was pheonemenal. Not only could I smell the ubiquitous hops, but the signature furious malt bill is evident, too. The taste is much more hop forward than furious, but does maintain some balance. This beer rivals sculpin and pliny, but yet is an unquestioned original. The mouthfeel is good. Similar to furious, again, in that it isn't highly carbonated. But that works. First time I've tried this beer, had two cans and will put this up there with the best double IPAs you can find anywhere.","PerHops","Dec 24, 2011"

I love the can art made by ball corporation, many local friends work for them in Weirton, WV. Pours a pale amber copper hue with a light colore billowing off white head, fine even lacing traces the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma is full of vegetal, onion/garlic spiciness. I can only guess that there's Summit hops in here with the taste I'm getting. The flavor is nice, this beer was canned on 12/14/11 we're talking super fresh. No abv or IBU info on the can, I find that hard to believe. They so proudly offered up 6.2% abv ad 99 IBUs on the Furious can, why not the abrasive ale. Alcohol is evident especially as it warms, it doesn't ruin the experience it is just there. Overall a very special DIPA in the can, my first experience with this style in that format. Surly is brave, and somewhat abrasive, but I enjoyed this beer carbonation is sturdy and body is full with resinous oils in the mix.","WVbeergeek","Dec 24, 2011"

Lots of pine and citrus and floral hops with a faint bit of bready malt sulking deep in a dark corner. A bit of malt breaks through in the flavor but is quickly sent to its room by the onslaught of pine and citrus. Medium body and level of carbonation with a slick resinous almost sticky mouthfeel.

It pours an attractive orange-amber with a very thick off-white head. Strongly hoppy flavor has an evergreen overtone, a fair amount of bitterness, and more than a hint of citrus with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Lively texture is fairly fizzy and leaves an edgy evergreen finish. How can anybody be abrasive after this one? Look for it, trade for it!","Cyberkedi","Jul 28, 2011"

4.47,-1.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A hard pour into my DFH snifter produces a finger of off white head which recedes leaving a thin ring and minimal lacing.The beer is a dark, cloudy amber to orange color. The nose is pure citrus. Mango, orange and tangerine jump out at me. There is a subdued sweet malt presence as well, but the hops really shine here. Taste is a very balanced mixture of citrus hops and sweet bready malt. Grapefruit, orange and mango predominate. The finish is juicy and bitter at the same time with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy without being at all cloying. Overall this is a wonderful DIPA from surly. One of my all time favorites, which I seek out every year.

4.57,0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"MF/O: Prickly carbonation kind of takes away from the feel and intensifies the bitterness, but balanced. Kind of a west coast Hopslam. I will definitely be seeking this out again","scottyshades","May 20, 2011"

I may have to rethink positions of my top 5 after this. I had a can from 2/28/11 last night that was decent, but not great. The month fresher one absolutely changed my mind about this beer. I can only imagine what it would be like a week or two after canning. Overall I'd say 4.5 out of 5. Which is what I'd give all of my top 5 DIPAs. Seek this beer out!","matttttYCE","May 14, 2011"
4.51,-0.4,3.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Popped the 16 ounce can and poured this honey-colored nectar with an orange glow into my DFH becker and raised an unimpressive head that sacrificed its structure to support its offspring...really nice lacing. The aroma that wafted up from the glass was awesome...it's as if I'm peeling a ripe, juicy red grapefruit. And the good news is that it pretty much transfers to the taste. The malts are hard to pick out underneath all the bitterness from the hops, but if you concentrate you cut through those 120ish IBUs and taste something like a honey bun. This has a classic mouthfeel for a DIPA which means a medium-plus body with enough IBUs to make the staunchest hop head happy. In fact, I've had few IPAs better than this one (one or two), but I've got a Pliny waiting in the wings which, if its reputation holds serve, all the IPAs on my favorite list will drop a rung.","Naugros","Beers"

As I move in for a whiff, I am immediately smacked in the face with passion fruit and a pine tree. Incredible aroma. I could smell this all day; do they sell this in air-freshener form? Flavor is more passionfruit / grapefruit, pine, apricots, and sweet caramel malts. Floral/fruity hops lingering in the finish.

Poured into a DFH tulip glass a darker, slightly haze, honey apricot color with a nice, full, sticky light tan head that coats the glass with lace as it settles. Pungent, musky aroma of hops in the nose of the citrus variety; with mainly orange and grapefruit undertones. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. At first sip I was wondering where the hop bitterness was but then BAM! it hits you towards the middle/end like a freight train. Well balanced though with a sweet malty feel in the beginning.

I prefer some of their other beers (I'm looking at you, Bender), but this is definitely something I could drink a few of if it were readily available.

4.54,0.2,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours cloudy orange/amber with a smallish, white head which dissipated into a coating or less. There is some light lacing all the way through. Nose is grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest and mango, with pine and floral notes. As others have said, the nose of this beer never quits. The taste is grapefruit, some sweet caramel malt, brown sugar and honey . The finish is dry and mildly bitter, but refreshingly so. Warning, wow, there is no sense of the ABV on the way down. Mouthfeel is medium to light with a wonderful crispness, medium carbonation, and only slightly sticky. For those who still think great things can't come in a can, I offer this as definitive evidence. All-in-all, this is a great DIPA and one i would love to have regular access to.","regspeir","Mar 30, 2011"

4.57,0.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is good for the style - crisp, slightly sticky, very dry finish, and a bit of harshness from the bitterness. This beer happens to do the dry part very well but the sticky part not as well - but the dryness wins out for sure. Drinkability is helped a lot by that dryness as it's the last thing the palate feels here. Intense aromas remain throughout the beer and flavors are fine as the beer warms. I had a tough time making the glass last, as the awesome dryness at the end of sips was too much to make me resist another swig. Wasn't let down by this beer, and look forward to trading for it on an annual basis.","veinless","Mar 28, 2011"

4.67,3.1,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"From a can into a chalice, it pours a clear dark amber with a cream color head. Nice lacing is left behind. The aroma is a bold honey or tangerine blossom tinged with the sweetness of peach. Hefty, yet well balanced, in taste with floral and citrus hops leading the way, caramel and a good bite at the end. Mouthfeel is heavy and satisfying as the flavor lingers. Overall, Abrasive is a hell of a Double IPA with exceptional balance and drinkability.","ActualAir","Mar 20, 2011"
4.55,0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"D/O- What a delicious brew! Alcohol is well hidden making this pint-sized can no match.

4.05,-10.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I'm glad to be trying this brew having heard such great things about it from everyone else. it pours a mostly clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises onion, strong mint, parsley, and some light caramel basking in the background. The taste holds notes of orange peel, cilantro, very light onion, black pepper, greens, very light caramel, light pine, and light mint. The body straddles the line between heavy light and light medium, with a mild carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA. It's a bit unbalanced toward the hops, but it never becomes o'erwhelming in that direction.","TMoney2591","Mar 19, 2011"
4.22,-6.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a clear copper color with a bone white head on the surface.

There was the initial mouthfull of terroir was potent, but subsequent sips are much less """abrasive""". There is a pretty decent flavor to it as well, there is a sweet caramel malt flavor behind the bitter hops. The hops are really nice, and actually finish as a minty flavor.

In my opinion this is a great example of what kind of various flavors you can get from hops. I am going to go out on a limb here and rate this as one of the five best Imperial IPAs I ever had, due to flavor and drinkability. If you are a alpha acid, hop head like me this is a beer that you will need to find or trade for.

The flavor is crisp and clean, tropical, citrusy, and sweet withough being cloying. Perfect grain bill, too much crystal sometimes kills an ipa, here it is great, muted yeast charecter, clean. Is it the oat? Chewy and full mouthfeel just shy of too much. This is one of my top three favorit x2ipa's period.","pmlondrigan","Feb 13, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, bitter hop, and slight wild onion. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, garlic, and mild onion. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The onion flavor I detected on this one reminded me of all the good memories I have of Gunba.

Head eventually dissipates into a solid skim, with swaths and spots of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals sweet citrus notes and a touch of slightly herbal, bitter rind. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tropical fruit seems to be co-mingled in the flavor profile. Finish is slightly bitter, but does not linger. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly oily consistency and a crisp, even carbonation.

A big blast of citrus, mango, pineapple, the works with oranges, a lot of those. A bready sweet biscuit as well. Taste is superb, really gets the essence of west coast hop bombs. To me though, this mostly reminds me of a lot of Port Brewing hoppy offerings. A whole bunch of orange and mango flavor in here backed by some sweet bready type yeast and light malts. Other tropics after that. Im really liking the feel here, it kinda tears through a layer of my mouth on the first few sips, than eases up with a mix of hops than light malt. Carb is great out da can, a medium body. I could not get down big gulps of this stuff for some reason. I usually tear through DIPA's, I had to take a laid back approach to this one.

So delicious and smooth, a bit of malt to hold it together, but not much. The mouthfeel is good. The drinkability is out of this world.

The aroma is strong enough that it leaps out of the glass, and can be detected feet away. Mandarin oranges, peaches, grapefruit, hibiscus, and pollen are all present in copious amounts. This is one beautiful smelling beer. The taste is pure hop juice. The bitterness isn't as firm as a lot of other DIPAs I've tasted which allows the hop flavors to show themselves more clearly. All aspects of the aroma are present in the taste with the addition of a nice soft earthiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture.

4.45,-1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Two day old Abrasive - you can't beat that. This one pours a nice amber with a good head on it. The smell is very much grapefruit and sweet malt. The flavor a also very much grapefruit/tropical fruit with a little bit of malt to back it up - but that's not the point of this one - it's a hop bomb. The tropical fruit and seet malt keep it light and not too bitter. As it warms the malt pokes out a bit more and a hint of alcohol comes on. It tastes quite a bit like a bigger version of Wet, which is one of my favorites. The mouthfeel is the only downfall to this brew, I was expecting a bit more body to it though I guess that might be expecting everything to be perfect. However, this is a very refreshing brew and not so ovewhelming that I could have 2-3, although the big ABV is a bit limiting.

4.56,0.7,3.5,5,5,3.5,4,"Okay, following the Crack & Glug, I was facing a finger-and-a-half of dense, eggshell-white head with good retention. As it slowly fell, it left behind lacing that may require a chisel to remove. Also, who planted a pine forest in my kitchen? The place smells like I am out in the field with my uncle, the hunter, when I was just a kid. Color was a hazy orangish-amber and that was just fine with me. I have railed repeatedly on the negative aspects of filtration-driven clarity. If it falls bright, so be it, but to manually run a beer through screen to clean it up for the masses reeks of destruction. It strips out character and flavor, like giving me a frontal lobotomy. Maybe that's what they meant by """under-brewed""". The nose was simply mouthwatering. It was like standing in an evergreen forest on a snowy day - cool, biting, fresh, resinous. Mouthfeel was medium but I could feel the grinder against my soft, pink tongue, removing everything in its path to my poor little taste buds, rocked into submission by so many AALs. My sinus cavity began to fill with the scent of industrial-strength pine and my tongue suddenly spontaneously combusted. I tried to put it out with another mouthful of beer, but it was like putting out fires with gasoline. Gah! This is why I got so deeply hooked as a hophead. Does anybody see a screeching monkey on my back all of a sudden? The finish was suddenly mellow, as though my nervous system had been ground down to the nerve endings and I was content to allow the Aeolian Harp to play across my spine. Gasp! A bandsaw blade to my Brain Housing Group might have the same effect. This ain't abrasive, it's downright industrial!

The aroma is a pretty intense, sweet grapefruit/juniper hop with a modicum of raspberry malt bleeding through. Strong and tempting. The first taste is pretty in line with the aroma, somewhat syrupy fruity hops with a fair bready malt undercurrent. It still evokes a curious but likeable juniper/evergreen idea in a medium plus bodied brew. Definitely a brew of solid constitution that demands some appreciation but it hides its 9.5% ABV quite well allowing for decent drinkability for the style. Mild carbonation but a smooth, somewhat thick feel that goes down quite reasonably.","Durge","Aug 03, 2010"

One thing I can say for certain is that the last time I had this (when it was called 16 Grit) is that is got me ever some drunk. Anyway, it comes out a clear orange color, without much of a head. Hops can be detected immediately upon pouring, giving off an herbal and fruity sort of hop flavor. I get notes of pineapple, grapefruit, mint leaf, and sticky resin. Very similar in flavor, with the sweetness and bitterness battling it out throughout the experience. In the end the bitter character has the edge. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and syrupy at times in light of the sweetness. Drinkability is great, but like I said before about my first experience with this brew, be careful, as it will knock you on your ass easily. Overall a pretty damned good DIPA.

The taste is very good, first some orange sweetness, then a little malty sweetness, a slight bitterness, then more piney bitterness, and then a clean almost refreshing ending.

Smell is aromatic with pronounced citrus and pine and also a savory umami note. Taste is hoppy pineapple with hints of umami (referred to in other reviews as a garlic note, but I think it's more akin to miso). Flavor profile is complex but quick. Clean finish for this style with minimal hints of caramel. Neutral hops at the very end. Clean and dry. The high ABV (9 - 9.7) WILL catch up with you. My opinion is that this DIPA is even better than Great Divide's Hercules.

Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical fruit. Not much for malt and the alcohol is not detected. The flavor starts suitably bitter with huge hop flavor. More pineapple and a sticky, resiny pine flavor. Some malt sweetness enters the picture and quickly disappears leaving me wondering if I detected it at all. Anyway, the malt is not overly sweet but enough to carry the hops. Finishes bitter but no sign of alcohol which is quite remarkable. The texture is nothing special but the body is medium and lively carbonated. One of the better brewed DIPAs. Available in cans now so more people will get to enjoy this beer, fresher.","morimech","Beers"

John told me it was filled from the bright tank, not kegged first. It could be this is the reason it feels like a cask ale, it has an English """real ale""" body but with massive American hops flavors. The beer is dark copper colored, clear, with a thin white foam. The smell is wickedly good, way better than Furious which smells a lot more like cat piss (I'm not knocking it, it's just the dominant aroma in Furious). I don't really get the feline urine in 16 Grit, mostly the hops come through as grapefruit and pine sap. The taste is stunning, I really don't know how it could be improved. The hops dominate with citrus flavors but there's a malty sweet counterbalance that keeps things interesting taste-wise. The body is stunning too, very """casky""".

4.64,2.4,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall this is one of the better DIPA's I've had, and thanks again to gford217 for sharing this.","glid02","Jan 10, 2009"
4.5,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a 64oz Surly growler with a two finger head that faded very slowly and had a crystal clear copper appearance. A huge citrus hop aroma and slight maltiness reappeared in the taste which hit the tongue like a hop semi - explosive! Felt smooth going down and the hops caught the tongue like little hop needles. Amazingly easy to drink for the amount of hops and high alcohol content. Very impressed with this beer and feel very lucky to have had it. I hope Surly seriously considers brewing it again next year because I've never had a DIPA quite like this - essentially furious on steroids!","deliriumfest","Jan 10, 2009"
4.72,4.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"I can't thank Brian and Bill enough for the opportunity to try and share this great beer with everyone this weekend. It is quite possibly the most drinkable DIPA I have tasted and one of the better beers I have tried in a while. Excellent.","gford217","Beers"
4.38,-3.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"drinkability is great. excellent balance. really nice depth overall. it didn't kick me in the face quite like i expected, coming across with more finesse than i would have guessed from the name and the brewery. good stuff. time for another glass!","grub","0"
4.4,-2.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Pours a slightly hazed dark copper/orange, medium thick off white head forms, drops to a thin layer and medium ring, nice lacing spirals, good retention, retains a real solid layer. Smell is nice, lots of caramel maltiness, some apple/orange, tangerines, grapefruit, floral, bready middle, lightly resinous hops, pineapple, tropical fruit, nicely balanced with the malts, more orange peel in the finish. Taste is nice too, lots of sweet orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple and floral, bready middle, some sweet honey and caramel malts, more orange peel and tangerine, quite a unique flavour, nice bitterness in the finish, well balanced, and the alcohol is nicely hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, interesting stuff, very smooth and drinkable. Thanks Russ!","Viggo","Jan 08, 2009"
4.63,2.2,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall I am very happy that Surly made this, and that I got to try it! One of the bestDIPA I have had, definitely one of the most drinkable. This is one to eek out for sure.","mikesgroove","Jan 08, 2009"
4.57,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Classified here as a double IPA. I'd have no problem calling it an american barleywine. Heck, I'd have no problem if they bottled this and I grabbed a stash for me! Well worth trying if you get a chance.","barleywinebrewer","Jan 07, 2009"
4.18,-7.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Alcohol is well hidden, and at least feels under 10%. Another very good Surly offering.","brdc","Jan 04, 2009"
4.57,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Thanks to JCB for this wonderful growler surprise. Bm'd me out of the blue and asked if i wanna meet up. Cloudy orange pour. Fluffy off white head and drippy lace. Fresh hop aroma (amarillos). Perfect bittersweet balance. Lots of tropical fruit flavors.","ucusty","Jan 02, 2009"

4.45,-1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"It is a shame that it was a special run to celebrate the end of Saturday growler sales due to state law issues. It is so powerful in flavor and taste that you just can not drink it all the time but it would be great to have a couple of cans for those nights when a change is in order.","doctormo","Dec 30, 2008"
4.32,-4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I got one of the last growlers on Monday morning, another great beer from Surly. Not as bitter as I thought it might be, pretty balanced for a DIPA. Hopefully this shows up again in the future!","Mdog","Dec 29, 2008"
4.5,-0.7,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Right off the bat this beer reminds me of Orange rum and then once I ponder the flavors, I realize it's similar to Surly's delicious Bitter Brewer. Orange citrus hops are the big flavor and aroma note for me in what is a surprisingly appropriately balanced DIPA. There are more pine and grapefruit in the background with subtle cinnamon spices and a very slight vanilla note. Jesus, this is good. I know I'm not the first or last person to say this, but I wish there was more of this beer. Easily one of my favorite DIPAs, better than Pliny the Elder even. If you can ever find this baby, drink it before someone else does.","tempest","Dec 28, 2008"

4.65,2.6,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I would say this is the best DIPA I have ever had. It has the huge hops but is still very drinkable.","br3wmeister","Dec 28, 2008"
4.5,-0.7,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Named 16 Grit, in honor of his dad's abrasives business, where the brew house is situated. Growler picked up and drank the very same day, fresh as can be. Into a pint glass, pours a dark amber copper color with a nice off-white head, good retention. The aroma is intense, some fantastic fruits popping out, caramel malts hovering in there too. The taste is even better, lives up to its name but drinkability doesn't suffer. The same fruits and caramel sugar are there, sweeter than I'd have thought. The mouth is great, thick, coating, oozing, but not syrupy, not too hot, lovely. Overall, probably the quickest I've ever drank a growler, if that says anything.","objectivemonkey","Dec 27, 2008"
4.67,3.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Herbal hop bitterness rings out up front. Pine resin/sap flavors follow, mixing with cookie dough malt. Hints of boozy fruits as well. Pineapple, tangerine, and mango hop bitterness come on strong near the finish. Faint warming notes, before cat pee, aspirin, and grapefruit bitterness take over the finish. Lingering fruit sweetness. Very nice! Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and very drinkable--especially if you like very fresh hop blast!","alexgash","Dec 27, 2008"
4.82,6.4,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Amazing. This might be the best DIPA out there. Too bad it's such a limited time. I love Surly and once again they've made a world class brew.","optiontwo","Dec 27, 2008"
4.79,5.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Another home run from Surly. They deserve all the accolades they get. It's sad that this will only be brewed once. I'm glad I had the opportunity to grab it while it was around.","Blybloke","Beers"
