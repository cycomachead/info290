This was a bottle less than 30 days old, and was reminiscent of stale, cold french onion soup. Looked nice, didn't smell terrible, but the taste of garlic and onion was overwhelming. Bad bottle? I don't know. Maybe I'll find out someday. As much I adore Gumballhead and Zombie Dust, this was an epic 3F's failure for me. I'll chalk it up as an "it wasn't meant to be" experience and move on.","glass_house","Apr 03, 2015"

It doesn't end. I can't get it to go away. It clings through water, through pickles. It's a candied papaya sort of flavor with drying bitterness.

A thin off-white cap remains in place for the duration and leaves rings. Aroma is tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, resin, pine, and caramel. Taste is medium citrus hop bitterness trailed by light malt sweetness. Medium bodied, oily and syrup thick texture, average to soft carbonation, finishes dry and bitter.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

This fine brew does not taste like or go down like some of the higher ABV brews. It has a very nice carmel color and the head lingers a while. While it is a Double/Imperial IPA and I would have not chosen this initially believing that it would be strong and all hopped up it was DELICIOUS!! One of my favorites the past two months.

Tropical fruits are on the tongue just like the nose: grapefruit, mango, sweet hone, etc. There is some pine and dankness as well. The perfect balance for me. As much as I love Dreadnaught, Alpha King, Zombie Dust, Arctic Panzer Wolf, etc., this is the best FFF offering imo.  An absolutely stunning beer that you should definitely get your hands on.","Ksoden1186","Nov 20, 2014"

4.49,-0.9,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"yup, its real, a double pale ale as they call it, and maybe the best beer i have had from the acclaimed three floyds. this stuff is magic, rich in grain base without ever being sweet. almost has the base of an esb, a huge one, but its in that range. the point here though is the hops, and its really hoppy. in the smell i am thinking simcoe, its so bitter smelling, green and leafy and crystalline, like the sticky dankest bud, where the fingers get all stuck like super glue. the nose is the hop equivalent of trimming blue dream plants, no joke. the flavor is less of that, more refined aggression if you will. the hops are woody here, more centennial like fundamentally, but so overdosed as to not be recognizable as their normal selves. the malt does in fact provide a cool balance to all the hops, which was unsuspected. it almost seems light for a second in the middle there, where the hops are more fruity than anything and the grain is at its fullest, but the bitterness returns to thrash the palate in the finish, its really intensely flavored stuff, but well put together. i have gone back and forth on whether or not the hype around this brewery is fairly founded, and this may have tipped me into thinking it is. really unique and enormous beer.","StonedTrippin","Oct 03, 2014"

Pours very slightly hazy golden orange colored with a huge creamy and fluffy white head. Aroma is big time juicy citrus hops, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, grass, sweet malt and very reminiscent of Dreadnaught (though it's been a while since I had that one). Flavor is big on the dry pine bitterness with sweet mango and grapefruits, some sweet malt backing but this is much lighter than expected. Lingering dry bitterness on the tongue. This seems to bridge the gap of the super bitter and the sweet tropical malty DIPA extremes and comes off very nicely. Medium plus bodied, very resinous, dry finish, with medium carbonation. This is excellent.","BMMillsy","Sep 12, 2014"

Just when you think these guys can't add anymore brilliance in terms of a big ipa they slap everyone In the mouth and create an all out jewel of a brew like this. It's def my 2nd favorite brew from them behind only the infamous dreadnaught, but both offer different qualities and that's great to see. No doubt Permanent Funeral will go down as an all time great for years to come.","BradtheGreat7","0"

Malt profile is pure Three Floyds - their bigger IPA/DIPA offerings seem pretty similar in this regard. I think the yeast used in common among many of these beers too. I find Three Floyds and Stone have very distinctive and identifiable fermentation profiles that I feel confident I can pickup blind pretty easily.

The malt comes through with a sweeter, caramel flavor to balance the slight bitterness from the hops. Overall, well balanced and delicious. Glad I could try it fresh from the source!","Dawgboned37","May 19, 2014"

Honestly, I got the best flavor when I was just drinking the beer; pairing it feels like a conundrum. It doesn't have the same dry acidy bite that calls out for cheese that I sometimes get from other big pale ales, and it's not as sweet as I expected from some of the other reviews. (I am guessing that the people who find it extraordinarily sugary are not drinking it fresh.) I hope I find it again so I can get closer to matching it with the perfect partner.

At $9 a pint, I decided to switch to the much less expensive Ballast Point Sculpin after that. Might as well have had a Bud. Just couldn't taste the Sculpin after that amazing hop blast from 3F.","paultierney1","Mar 21, 2014"

I do however prefer my DIPAs to be a little heavier on the tongue, but that's the only negative I can come up with. Overall, this beer is a must for any lover of hops.","Rizalini","Mar 20, 2014"

Taste is just so big and luscious with the gambit of citrus going on here.  You get citrus rind, juicy freshness, and even the orange based meaty pulp plays in the flavor.

4.81,6.2,4.75,5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Pours a very nice orange color. Minimal head that fizzled out quick. Leaves a nice bubbly ring around the glass. This smells awesome. Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, some other tropical fruits. It's so juicy. Tastes follows the nose really well. A lot of ipas smell awesome then fall short on the taste, this is not one of those ipas. Truly delicious. Grapefruit is abundant but there are so many other tropical flavors, too. Papaya, mango, hint of pineapple sweetness. So much flavor it's almost overwhelming. Slight alcohol burn and bitterness. The bitterness lingers on the top of my mouth. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, not overly carbonated but enough to feel it on the tongue. So easy to drink. I really liked his. Even with almost a month on it and it being shipped in artic temperatures it was amazing. If you like juicy ipas, definitely find one of these.","Mikeypnh","Beers"

Robust spicy tones from hops and malts. Beautifully sweet on the palate, balanced by just enough bitterness...again, piney, slight citrus, over-ripe papaya. Complex malt profile, some aromatic malt, and I swear a hint of rye. Finishes strong, tingling with a pleasant lingering residue that is not entirely bitter, nor sweet, nor alcoholic.

4.93,8.8,4.75,4.75,5,5,5,"Appears a glowing orange copper hue with a big khaki tan beige head forming thick with a rocky textured head, fine speckled lacing layers on the sides of my chalice. Aroma is straight up citrus peels, pineapple flesh, and other tropical fruit notes flowing from the glass. So worth the drive to Newark, OH to try the last of their stock of this fine American brewed IPA. I don't know the next time I will see this beer but I will definitely savor this pour of 22 ounces of liquid bread coated hop candy. The flavor is sugar coated raw herbaceous hops, big citric layers, orange marmalade, tropical fruits...mango, star fruit, and hints of passion fruit. Over ripened fruit juice with bready malts bring all the caramelized sugars to the forefront and the big oily hop oils let those sweet candy qualities fade to the background. Mouthfeel is big oily resinous IPA, carbonated well carries each sip effortless down the gullet, to equate to perfect realm of dangerous drinkability. I can't talk enough about how much I enjoy this beer, all of the true hopheads listening go find this, drive 6-8 hrs if you have to, hell make a pilgrimage to the brewery. I might even start listening to metal if Pig Destroyer had a hand in the collaborative creation of this liquid beauty.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

I had 2 of these at the brewery and made sure I had a dozen in my trunk before I left. Dark redish brown appearance, floral hopiness and sweet smell, wonderful flavors abound with a perfect balance of sweet and hop with a long lasting piney flavor that sticks around for a while.

Point being, it lives up to that level of expectation. Since we’ve had the pleasure of sampling Zombie Dust there are certain obvious differences, but to no real detriment. This guy is much more fusel, boozy, phenolic, and generally strong, but then again it’s about twice the abv. This remains decently well hidden throughout, but is nicely contributory when it comes up every now and again. The tropical fruitiness in the end was astounding, giving sugary sweetness, syrupy thickness, and glorious balance. The nose is not as juicy as it could be, but that is merely keeping it just “awesome”, rather than "perfect". With too much warmth the booze does take things a touch off base in the flavoring. This is a phenomenal addition to the masterful pale ale lineup, and something I certainly wish I bought more than one bottle of on my visit to the brewpub. Simply awesome.","TheBrewo","May 30, 2013"

There was a slight warming impression in the aftertaste that was accompanied by a peppery nature in the back of the throat. In terms of Imperial IPAs, this one is right up there with FFF's Dreadnaught. Really good stuff.","JohnnyHopps","May 25, 2013"

Initially thought this was a Pale Ale but doing a little web searching steers me towards DIPA instead. Putting away my Three Floyds pint glass in favor of a Delirium Tremens tulip. There's a very slight haze cutting through the orange liquid and a frothy cap of white foam sits up top, about 2 fingers tall. Good retention and lacing. Heavy hitting fruit in the aroma with mango, citrus, and some dankness. Not picking up much in the way of malt. Big, biting bitterness grabs on the palette immediately with piney, orange being prominent in the hop flavor. A little sweetness on the back-end could be coming from caramel malt. Definitely picking up on some warming from high ABV with a medium-body and modest carbonation. Thanks again, Al!","BrewerB","May 24, 2013"

I was thinking that this was a pale ale as stated by the label and somewhere in the 5-7% range. I was shocked when I learned the actual ABV, but that's a testament to the balance of this brew. Nice gold pour with dense white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is aromatic with a few varietals of hops coming to the surface, mainly citrus, lemon rind, melon, and pine come through. The taste is fruity and full of delicious hop flavor up front with light bitterness. Tastes as if this brew is hop bursted as the bitterness is well overshadowed by the aromatic hops. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and peach join the party with a sturdy malt presence towards the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with smooth and somewhat creamy body. Overall, quite a tasty beer with absurd balance and drinkability.","homebrew311","May 12, 2013"

Everything holds up to it and matches it well. Perhaps the most perfect balance of any imperial IPA I have had. Very well done Three Floyds.

4.64,2.4,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"First off, I love how Three Floyds tries to confuse people by putting "pale ale" on the label. I am not being sarcastic, I think it's funny and unique. Secondly, the artwork on the label is awesome. I am a huge fan of the genre of metal that Pig Destroyer play...though I am not a Pig destroyer fan. I tend to like Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin, The Chariot, BTBAM, etc., but never got into Pig Destroyer. Now, let's get to the beer. Pours a nice clear golden orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely citrus fruit and piney aromas. Sweet honey with a ton of hops and just a bit of tropical fruit...mango mostly. Just a hint of malt in the nose. Taste is fantastic. Not overly sweet...just the right amount of sweetness for a DIPA of this ABV. The hops are the most noticeable in this beer. I had a six pack of ZD a long time ago, so can't really compare. Some sticky, malty, honey-ish flavors...but thankfully just a tiny bit. Lovely blend of citrus and tropical flavors...stellar combination of hoppiness. Finish is smooth and kinda dry. Drinkability is very high, as alcohol is well hidden...not hot at all. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but perfectly carbonated. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that I wish I could get more of. I would love to see how this one would do if it had been at The Bistro's DIPA Festival during SF Beer Week.","DovaliHops","May 04, 2013"

Taste is very rich and satisfying, a tropical hop explosion, everything I was hoping for and more. A little boozy, but not overpowering.

3.98,-12.1,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Overall - A nice limited release, but I'll be sticking with other FFF brews. They call it a double pale ale, not a double IPA. I can see why. It's hard to believe it's 10.5% ABV though. It's blended extremely well. Even as it warmed up, the taste did not fall off. That's huge for this style. Extra points just for that.","sbxx","Apr 13, 2013"
4.71,4,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"O - It's no surprise that Three Floyd's knows how to brew great hoppy beers, but this is just absolutely ridiculous -- astonishingly good. Makes Zombie Dust seem like water, this is so intense. Be sure to grab this one while its still around!","wyatt13","Apr 13, 2013"

4.48,-1.1,4,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"O - A very tropical and sweet beer from FFF balanced with the usual FFF hop bitterness. Definitely a unique beer in the FFF profile though with so much juicy and tropical hops. Great collaboration that is definitely worth seeking out.","jeonseh","Apr 12, 2013"

4.58,1.1,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this may be the best double IPA Three Floyds has ever brewed. It feels very much like an amped up, imperial Zombie Dust. Bursting with juicy, dank, fruity flavors and a nice clean hop bite, Permanent Funeral is a big, bold beer. The only thing I didn't love was the relatively strong alcohol heat present in the flavor. I'm a fan of high ABV beers but I feel like knocking this down to 8.5 or 9% would make this a more balanced and easier drinking IPA. Still, this is a fantastic and extremely well-made beer with one helluva hardcore label and name.","WolfsbaneBloom","Apr 12, 2013"

4.53,0,4,4.75,4.75,4,4.25,"Overall: FFF hits another DIPA out of the park, following their others. I don't care if they call it a Pale Ale, its a double Zombie Dust that's heavy on the citrus that is barely balanced by an intense malt presence in the middle of the swig. It's a beer that lives on the precarious edge of balance, which is typical of FFF and definitely worth going out of your way to buy a bottle of. I usually prefer a little more balance to my DIPAs, like from Pliny or NG IIPA, but I am definitely very pleased with how this one came out.","Stevedore","Apr 10, 2013"

The smell of the beer gives off a really nice sweet fruity aroma, plenty of grapefruit on the nose here. The taste of the beer is give off a really nice balance of sweetness with a dominant bitterness in there as well. The fruit flavors of grapefruit and oranges really give this a vibrant citrusy flavor. The mouthfeel is great, really nicely carbonated and has a thinker oily feel to it. Overall this beer is awesome, hoping it can possibly become a regular rotation for FFF some day. Definitely try this beer before its gone.","Knapp85","0"

It's massive, it's bold, it's brutal and yet the bitterness is kept in check making this wonderfully drinkable.","kevanb","Apr 02, 2013"

4.79,5.7,4.25,4.5,5,5,4.75,"Pours a bright, opaque sunset orange color with decent carbonation and about a finger length head that dissipates to a thin lacing. Smells of pretty bright, juicy tropical fruits like papaya, guava, and pineapple. Also get some resinous citrus fruits like orange and a slight grapefruit. Nice candied sweetness as well. Smells like a big, sweet, citrusy double ipa. Taste is amazing. Starts with bright, clean citrus fruits like orange and grapefruit with some resinous pine that adds quite a bit of abrasive bitterness. Then melds into a nice carmel/candied sweetness, somewhat bready malt backbone. This gives the fruity hop qualities a more juicy-like flavor. Finish brings a slight abrasive bitterness back, but its subdued compared to some of their other dipas. Along with this comes more of the tropical fruit variety. Pineapple, papaya, mango, and orange stand out as well as a great candied sweetness. Also get just a hint of pine. Just the slightest alcohol burn on the end, but no alcohol to smell or taste, which is impressive for 10.5%. A crisp and somewhat clean, refreshing finish that really makes this beer awesome. High medium body with a creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel from the hops, but still very clean compared to other dipas at this strength. I have very high expectations when it comes to three floyds dipas and this one meets it and then some. Outstanding beer.","brewskis","Mar 30, 2013"
