4.41,5.3,4.5,4,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Overall: I think that this is a great beer for any time of the year. I like that it has a higher ABV so that you can unload after a long hard day and at the end of the first beer you are already having a mild buzz. I think that the IBUs are not excessive as they are balanced by a malty body that makes for a very drinkable beer. Drink it nice and cold and be sure to pour it instead of drinking it out of the bottle.","hopphead31415","Yesterday at 08:27 PM"

4.32,3.1,3.75,4.75,4.25,4,4.25,"From bottle, can't find date. Quality nearly straight hops beer.  Not too much sweetness or florally or citrusy flavor going on.  Very well put together, a little malt mix is just right.  I'd call this a 1.5x, not quite a double, like I do with Southern Tier 2x (my session IPA).  I stress how good this beer smells with every sip.  Lagunitas makes very nice IPA's and this fits in quite nicely. It stimulates the front of the palate and settles in the back of the mouth with strong hops, but so super smooth you will keep grabbing for more.  I repeat a third time, this beer smells awesome!","hotpauko","Apr 01, 2015"

Smells of pine, citrus, banana peel, booze. Slams the tongue with a powerful wallop of hop fruitiness and with some malty caramel to balance. A little overwhelming--I never quite find the subtleties other reviewers seem to find. Mouthfeel is a little oily and leaves you smacking your lips from the bitterness. This is a very good double IPA/West Coast hop-bomb.","lipster","Mar 31, 2015"

There is no malt detectable whatsoever, and in my opinion this hurts the beer by making it very unbalanced to the point of being almost undrinkable. At first I thought maybe the beer was spoiled, but the code of 008 5 on the neck of the bottle shows it was bottled on January 8th, 2015 (5 weeks ago). I guess I'm just not a fan of this one. Maybe I'll give it another go sometime down the road, but I probably wouldn't drink this beer again.","TheItalianStallion","Feb 14, 2015"

The weird thing about this is as you look at the carbonation bubbles through the glass, it seems like they are suspended in jelly. Weird, huh???. Anyway, head is nice, big and fluffy and lacing is ample, clinging and simmering to the inside of the glass. Aroma is heavy on piny hops and some citrus(grapefruit and lemon, maybe. Taste definitely has the IBU's and the pine resin, grapefruit rind and other assorted citrus comes through, maybe not so balanced, but bold and a hop lover's dream. Feels good on the palate, kind of thick, but overall, an IPA that all would love for the boldness. Good stuff, here!!","hophugger","Dec 05, 2014"

4.25,1.4,,,,,,"O- Overall a dominant hop forward beer that has just enough malt backbone to carry it without it interfering with your hop fix. As  it warms the beer slides to a little more pallet-able but for the most part if you don't like bitter, avoid. However if you like to push the IBU limits (reads 102) this is for you. I have had several beers above this stated measurement that were for sure less bitter. If i'm not mistaken this is made with hop extract instead of cone or pellet so if you think extract is inferior I say give this guy a try.","Fieldzy27","Sep 25, 2014"

I get light notes of citrus, pine and orange peel on the nose with very slight hints of caramelized malts. All leading to a smooth and crisp taste full of flavor. It is sharp with pine and citrus and a light note of orange and wheat finishing out with a dry bite. In my opinion, you get so much more than what you pay for in this one!","AyeMito","Aug 13, 2014"

Might have wanted it a bit fresher, but that is no news flash. 1 and 1/2 fingers of white head which dissipated quickly and left some nice lacing. Interesting tangerine hue in the light, very tempting. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, and bitterness (yes, bitterness... this IS a 102 IBU brew!). Pine notes on the front wave of the taste profile, along with a citrusy (almost lemony) mid-note, with a big bitter finish. Continual carbonation, refreshing mouthfeel, and a slightly oily presence on the back end. This had a nice balance for a big beer, and though I was v. happy... would have to try one that was super fresh to make this a go-to choice.","Mikus","Jul 21, 2014"

It kind of smells like a tropical-citrusy fruit salad filled with pineapple, orange, and lemon with just a smattering of pine. The taste was a bit different from the aroma. There is more of a malt presence than I anticipated. The taste has more piney hops than the nose would suggest and the citrusy hop flavor is a bit more subdued. It leave a strange, piney (but not unpleasant) bitterness on the tongue. Overall, a pretty solid brew.","thomda11","Jul 15, 2014"

Can't wait....boom, it hits you with a bouquet of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, and right into a crisp bitter finish 102 IBUs well balanced and offset by the fruitiness.

After my first sip it became one of my favorites; it is bitter, but not overpowering. I prefer this one over their standard IPA. Sure there are other better selections out there, but you will never find such a great beer at this price.","JulianTellez","Apr 22, 2014"

I was very pleased with my selection. It poured a nice amber color with a very thick foamy rich white head. What got me though was the smell. This smell is what every IPA should strive for. Floral, fruity sweet and good. I could sit there smelling it all night. The smell didn't translate completely into the taste, but it was still very good. I'd say the lower level of the top tier of IPAs. Felt very smooth in my mouth, very refreshing. I think this IPA is very underrated. I am glad I found it and would not hesitate to drink it again.","Seanem44","Apr 14, 2014"

4.32,3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/19/2014. Pours lightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge mango, papaya, peach, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with huge citrus/tropical hop presence with light-moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, papaya, peach, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, papaya, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with a great crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA! All around awesome complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

Taste is mouthwateringly hoppy, zesty, spicy, syrupy, hop oily, pine needles, resinous with hop crystals. Heavily hopped indeed. The clean malt profile is just enough to provide a nice backdrop for the massive hopping. Good stuff when feeling hoppy.","tastybeer","Feb 16, 2014"

Pours a clear golden copper hue with a generous head that quickly lessens down to just a quarter inch of thick frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. The Mouthfeel is smooth and easy. The kind of beer that one could get into trouble with if you know what I mean. The aroma is typical of that of a very hoppy ipa; citrus, pine, and an overwhelming aroma of skunky weed. The flavor is heavy with pine and grapefruit. Very bitter and very astringent...but in a very good way. This is a very enjoyable double ipa for those that like theirs with a ton of hops and bitter notes. This beer is certainly not about balance but neither is hopslam and everyone loves that. And this is a he'll of a lot cheaper and easier to get your hands on.","lochef81","Jan 17, 2014"

Decided to walk to the corner store for some honey buns and cheese popcorn when I stumbled upon this beauty. Hadn't tried Lagunitas until this Sunday. I had the Sucks with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Decided to give a Lagunitas brew another try since I was thoroughly impressed. I'm a hop-lover through and through and this baby swept me off my feet and carried me up a flight of crystal stairs into a palace of pure happiness. Needless to say it was delicious. It's hoppy and citrus-y. The mixture of the two dances on your tongue and tingles your senses but not too intensely. It's smooth all the way through- no bite, no bizarre aftertaste, just pure goodness all the way down. The smell is nice although it smells a tinge too nutty for my liking but that's my biggest complaint. It is a fantastic brew and I would definitely recommend it.","Prince_Mbutu","Jan 08, 2014"

Smells like the freshest piney hops you can imagine, a little citrus but really the aroma here is all about the pine. The taste is incredibly balanced. Hops coat the mouth, but its not overly bitter or sweet. Again the piney hops are what really take the show. Mouthfeel is medium to light and the finish isn't too dry. Ok so I've had this said to me, but I have never had it fresh enough to make a comparison (the day I went to both Russian River and Lagunitas I was a little too overwhelmed) but Hop Stoopid tastes and smells exactly, and I mean EXACTLY like Pliny. Just sayin'. When you have them fresh they are indistinguishable. And of course, both are exceptional.","spark3148857","Dec 21, 2013"

The smell shows off the entire range of hop characteristics: I get grapefruit, other citrus flavors, pine, floral, and herbal notes. Also present is a sweet malt smell. Predictably, Hop Stoopid gives a huge hop bomb on the way down, replete with citrus flavors but also quite earthy, with a malt finish that balances out the taste somewhat. It's as drinkable as the best DIPAs I've had and a stellar example of the style. I've had Heady Topper and this compares well with it, while being cheap and easy to find.","itsscience","Oct 28, 2013"

A dark honey copper color with around five fingers of white head greets the drinker, releasing a classic DIPA aroma of citrus, pine, green leaf/grass, a little pineapple or some other tropical note. Palate is grapefruit and tangerine, mango and starfruit, ample pine and strong menthol, some cattiness. The bitterness is interesting. At first one wonders if there shouldn't be more! What a great showcase for hop flavor ... Then as the iso-alphas accrue, you realize your mouth is getting numb and this thing is getting punishing. Its a woody, floral, and fruity hop bomb.There are culinary herb rosemary type notes and a black pepper spice in the bitter finish. The malts provide some sweet caramel balance but the hops lead the way, as they should. Archetypal DIPA. Although Lagunitas uses extract for bittering I still get vegetal flavors, presumably due to aggressive flavor and dry hop regimes. I am not complaining. Thick heavy body that leaves some sugars but the bitterness remains. Some boozy character but not unpleasant. Track it down.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 27, 2013"

OCCASION: drafting while draughting (reused pun, for draft number 2)--a big-bodied beer for a big boy draft!... APPEARANCE: beautiful soft orange with a steady, centered eruption of bubbles; thick, creamy head is staunch and off-white--yes, perfect... AROMA: the shock and awe of the IBUs is on display, with the majority of the scent of a pine cone slicing through an orange, mango and pineapple simultaneously into a hop bomb shish kebob; as advertised ...PALATE: creamy, stirring thickness with an immediate warmth that seers, then cradles the throat; balanced overall, with a reasonable aftertaste...TASTE: delicious citrus (plum and pineapple pervade) are unrelenting; the alcohol metes its energy out as the glass drains; the aftertaste of funky yeast is a little difficult to take pleasure in... not knowledgeable enough to construe the good news/bad news of the label's CO2 hop extraction explanation, I defer to my senses and buy into its overt toasty malt/hop balance, mostly--not as much as Adrian Peterson being my #1 pick... OVERALL: this beer is BIG, blessed with a peripheral attractiveness and a substance that follows up reasonably on its initial promise...impossible to remove the hop from the teeth, like the Altoid of the beer world...worth the bomber and its relatively fair price tag...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2013"

Not what I was expecting. I found a caramel flavor hidden amongst what was supposed to be a hop bomb. The malt profile was extremely pleasant and the alcohol well hidden.

This beer reminds me of the iconic Russian River brew of the exact same style; that's saying alot given Ive only tried Pliny once and at least a year ago. Hop Stoopid is one of the best DIPAs you can buy for your dollar. Safe to say now in my top 5 of the style. Im not sure why it took the convenience of a local chain grocery for me to retry it. If you're a hophead, you'll find this incredibly drinkable.","TBoneJones","Jul 22, 2013"

I am left wanting more in the realm of taste, since Hop Stoopid feels sort of one-dimensional. Yet, a one-dimension Lagunitas DIPA is better than most of the market's offerings, especially beers that don't have the same amazing smells and feels that Hop Stoopd unleashes upon the brain. If you can find it, buy it. The experience is worth far more than the cheap $3.99 price tag.","ShreddedThumb","May 19, 2013"

Petaluma is straight up the street from the legendary Russian River brew pub and brewery, and frankly, a little overlooked because of their wide distribution. I would put Hop Stoopid up against Pliny the Elder on just about any day and say it's an even match. Pliny is more grape-fruity, and Hop Stoopid has a little more funk. Both are clear, citrusy, hop-nectars of the Gods. I don't think I could take one over the other though, the only thing I really see hurting the Hop Stooped is that it is more widely available.","SigEp","Apr 22, 2013"

It's a fun beer for evenings where you don't want to spend any time thinking about what you're drinking. Sometimes digging for subtile flavors gets tiresome; and you just need instant gratification. At no point during the glass or bottle will it balance-out or settle down. It's going to hit you with a heavy dose of hops every sip, and its the beer you wish lackluster IPAs were daring enough to be.","Bauzen","Mar 30, 2013"

Huge hop flavor up front and some piney bitterness left behind. Sweet with some grass and mild malt. Dry mouthfeel. Similar overall to DFH 90 minute, but not as well rounded and complex. Still a great beer.","Samuel906","Feb 27, 2013"

3.85,-8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours like them all, and everlasting lacing. Smells malty and sweet and resins, but not really terrifically hop-prominent on this one. On the more floral/pine than citrus side. Actually, as a bit of stale-ness on the nose, if you know what I mean. Taste is terrific though. Sweet and bitter and hoppy and all that, and with a bitter sustain that really delivers. Maybe a bit malt forward, probably because this might be two or three months old too. Still delivers, although I think I'd rate this higher if was fresher.","Bitter_Echo","Dec 16, 2012"

The Hop Stoopid's name will fool you; it is a thoughtfully crafted, hoptastic brew!","PatriotsRule","Dec 09, 2012"

Easily accessible, seems to always be pretty fresh, and the value CANNOT be beat. I paid $4.99 for this bottle, hard to beat that. I've tried most of the big name IPAs and DIPAs, and Hop Stoopid could compete with most of them. I don't usually like to compare beers to each other, but Hop Stoopid really does taste pretty damn close to Pliny. Just a little more malty and not quite as dry, so if you want to try Pliny but can't get your hands on any, just go down to the corner market and pick yourself up some Hop Stoopid, it's about half the price for a beer that's world class...in my opinion. Now if only Lagunitas would put this beer out in 6 packs....Anyways, I'm rambling. Hop Stoopid is an A beer, if you haven't tried it then stop reading this review and get your ass out there and get some!","bifrost17","Oct 23, 2012"

The body continues in a similar vein, though the hop flavours are weaker and give way at times to the booze.

4.59,9.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours deep clear golden orange with a tall, biege head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. Only a small amoutn of head is left atop the beer after the head retreats. Small, tiny bubbles can be seen rising along the side of the glass. The hop aroma is very strong. I detect those big piney, resinous and citrus hop aromas. There is some sweetness as well. It's a very delicious smelling West Coast IPA. As far as the taste goes, the hops aren't as powerful as the smell would indicate. Those big, juicy citrus flavors are balanced with that bitter pine flavor in the back end. The malt really doesn't come through in the flavor, which allows the balanced hop flavors to shine. The body is much lighter than the typical double IPA, registering on the lower end of medium. There isn't a lot of carbonation to speak of, but it is there. This beer is smooth with a dry finish. It is highly drinkable in terms of the style. This is an excellent and unique beer in many ways. If you're a hop head, do try this beer if you can find it.","acevenom","Jul 15, 2012"

Taste follows the nose, strong grapefruit, pine, and funk. Excellent hoppy brew, almost no malt in sight. Somewhat light mouthfeel which I feel suits this very hop heavy style.

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"OVERALL: A great beer from Lagunitas, with all the hop character that die hard hop heads can't deny, but a solid enough balance that it could appeal to a broader spectrum of beer drinkers. Also, affordably priced, so it is a good fridge staple.","Stinkypuss","Jul 01, 2012"

I certainly didn't feel that the flavor or the smell was well better than average for the style. I did, however, feel the price was WAY better than average for the style, and that boosted the overall score. 8% ABV, tastes good, easy to drink, doesn't destroy the palate, and it's really cheap? Certainly worth buying again for these reasons. Not a knock your socks of kind of beer, but a knock your socks off beer when considering the price.","HarrySTruman","Jun 30, 2012"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this beer over three years ago, and I thought it smelled strongly of cat urine. Either the aroma has changed, my nose has changed, or that was an odd batch. Anyway, I approve of this bottle. In terms of Lagunitas DIPAs, I think it's better than Maximus but not as good as Sucks. Very drinkable, easy to polish off a bomber.","angrybabboon","Jun 30, 2012"

I have tried IPA after IPA and Stone is of the finest but this in some ways has a more defined citrus, grapefruit and pine tastes that make american IPAs sooo good. I have had too many poor IPAs and this is of the TOP FIVE, ohh and considering the price, JEEZ can't be beat. Body is on the lighter side and it goes down sooo easy, maybe too easy could find yourself in trouble as it makes you want more.","eman1","Jun 27, 2012"

The aroma seamlessly melts into the flavor. The strong hop presence includes grapefruit, floral and a touch of pine around the edges. The bitterness abounds but the caramel is strong enough to provide just enough balance to make this go down clean and balanced. A modicum of resin is residual.

Following the nose with citrus, pine, and grass. Not much left for the malt, but some caramel sweetness sneaks through. Mouthfeel is quite bitter and puckering, but it's a good thing.

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): Hop Stoopid is always enjoyable. In my mind it’s not quite a DIPA, it’s really just a standard (but well-done) American IPA on some steroids—no massive body and not quite enough ABV to compare to a lot of the better DIPAs out there. But it is what it is, and that’s how I’m judging it: a strong IPA with a buttload of piney, bitter-citrus hops on the palate and a buttload of sweet-citrus hops in the nose. That said, in this realm of Strong IPA/Pseudo-DIPAs, I think Sucks is a better, more balanced and dynamic beer, and certainly a better value. Still, I’ll go for Hop Stoopid every once in a while in the future, no doubt. Dear Lagunitas, HOP STOOPID SIXERS PLEASE.","fmccormi","Mar 01, 2012"

They say it's brewed with extracts to try to reach these high levels, which kinda makes sense from the way that it tastes. For me it's great because I love the combination of grapefruit and copper in an IPA/DIPA, but it's definitely more of an IPA for those looking to see some of the different elements taken to the extremes without too much else going on to spoil the show.","Groulxsome","Feb 29, 2012"

Mouthfeel is slightly heavier than average, where it ought to be for a DIPA, with a bit of carbonation. This is a great west coast IPA. It certainly ranks among the best regularly available DIPAs.","gkunkle","Jan 25, 2012"

The Lagunitas Hop Stoopid is hoppy, but far more complex than I had previously given it credit for.","TheCorkStopsHere","Jan 13, 2012"

It's so rare to find Double IPA that isn't a hop bomb but this certainly fir that bill and it's rare that I find a Bomber that I can't wait to buy and down by myself once again. There's no doubt that this fit that bill and for anyone who loves Nugget Nectar, a SN big bottle, or any of the Green Flash brews, this should be on his or her must-try list. Highly recommended!","JerzDevl2000","Dec 09, 2011"

I think that probably explains the raw sort of hop bitterness that seems to be sort of one dimensional. Saying that though, the beer is still really tasty. I wish the booze was toned down a touch but otherwise I enjoyed the shit out of this beer. Definitely a great brew for $5!","younger35","Dec 08, 2011"

As I drink a mouthful, I can taste huge pineapple and grapefruit flavors. The forefront of the flavor so to speak, is sweet and citrus-y, while it has a dry finish of bitter piney hops. The overall mouthfeel is thick and creamy however. I expected a boozy taste but there was none. Fresh & Tasty!","Neorebel","Dec 04, 2011"

3.67,-12.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! And it moves on to a beer I should've had a long time ago, frankly. It pours a clear straw-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light pine, toffee, and some very light mint. The taste holds notes of greens, toffee, caramel, very light mint, and very light lime. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid DIPA, but it lacks a lot of the hop character I was expecting, both from the style and the name. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, but it falls short of great for me.","TMoney2591","Nov 08, 2011"

I picked up a bottle tonight and was pleasantly surprised for the msot part. It's a very straight-forward beer. A big hop hip in the beginning followed by a hay/grain/grass solid flavor that lasts through the finish. Very basic, but well-composed and would satisfy anyone looking for a quick DIPA fix.","Klym","Nov 08, 2011"

4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is the closest thing to Pliny that I've tasted. It does a great job of hiding its bitterness and ABV. This is a departure from Lagunitas' normal tendency, which is to punch you in the face with hops. I appreciate the subtlety in this beer and it shows that Lagunitas isn't a one trick pony. The nose is really the main act here. You get a complex, intriguing hop aroma that is also backed up by a hint of the farmhouse spiciness that's advertised on the bottle. I really appreciate this spicy characteristic, as it is the main thing that sets it apart from PtE. One of my favorite DIPAs, this is a cheaper alternative to Pliny that is just as good.","Philousa","Nov 06, 2011"

Im starting to like Lagunitas alot.","Number967","Oct 13, 2011"
4.66,11.2,3,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Holy sweet elixir! I usually stay away from DIPAs because they are often syrupy boozebombs with a hop character obscured by sickly sweet grossness. Not so with this one. The appearance is nothing special; amber with small head and little lacing. The smell and taste are nothing short of heavenly. Definite west coast hop flavor mingling with clover honey and a wonderful herbal quality reminiscent of fresh-cut grass (in a good way). Slick mouthfeel combined with barely noticeable alcohol make this one a winner. Drinkability is ridiculous. Reminds me of a less brutal Runiation. Highly recommended.","HossMcGraw","Oct 11, 2011"

4.04,-3.6,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"O: A solid West coast style IPA ("hop bomb"). I've had better, but this one is sure to please. Quality and craftsmanship are definitely there and it's quite flavorful while remaining drinkable. Probably not an IPA I would turn to on a regular basis, but definitely something I would recommend to those seeking to quench a hop-craving and no doubt a great example of the style (especially considering the location). Another solid one from Lagunitas. Cheers!","kflorence","Oct 09, 2011"

Aroma dominated by hops, of course - crisp citrus and resin flavors but a bit strange to my nose in places. Still very good. Flavor is excellent - it is remarkable that brew with this much hops loaded into it could still retain its balance - but it does. Really really hoppy flavor with a light malt backbone that somehow manages to hold the hoppiness in check. Tremendous hoppy finish that is surprisingly quick with no lingering aftertaste. Palate is good - light and crisp, not chewy. All round excellent brew.","cosmo4u","Oct 06, 2011"
4.77,13.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"O: I can't believe how often I pass this up. At $4.99 a bottle it should be a crime to not buy this more often.

3.99,-4.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"There are some great citrus hops, lemon zest, and some grapefruit up front and some more prominent alcohol taste (8% a.b.v), but not a lot of malt to back it up. On my first try with this beer (I am writing of my third) I felt this way, but gave it another chance, at a warmer temperature, and it seemed to be much more balanced. With such a discrepancy I felt I had to try it a third time and unfortunately I am experiencing the same hop attack (which I absolutely love) with nothing to back it up. The small amount of malt I do get is light, sweet and delicious--a perfect compliment to the citrus and boozy qualities, but there’s not enough, leaving me with a strong, unbalanced forefront.","evyoung","Sep 22, 2011"

Smells more sweet and fruity than it does bitter. The taste is magnificent. This is one of the most balanced DIPAs I have ever had. The bitterness is assertive, but balanced well by a nice malty foundation. The sweetness reminds me of brown sugar, and the hops give a nice pineapple and grapefruit taste. The mouthfeel is almost perfect. It is medium body with medium carbonation. Easily one of the most approachable DIPAs to date. Highly recommended to hop heads and those who are just starting to drink IPAs.","hmf05","Sep 14, 2011"

Smells pretty hoppy, but also has a malty sweetness to it. Not overly bitter for 100+ IBU's, actually a lot less bitter than I expected, but really good. Sweetens up on the back-end. Has a nice amount of carbonation and no alcohol presence at all. I'd have to say this is one of the better DIPA's I have had. I'll be getting some more of this soon.

I have always really dug this beer and if you want to get someone into the swing of drinking Hop Bombs this is a good 101 Beer for them .

4.32,3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours deep somewhat hazy amber with a bubbly two finger head - very airy with good retention leaving lines of wispy lacing as it drops ever so slowly. Smells piny, oily, sweet from both hops (extract) and malt, and resinous. Tastes nice and clean with distinct sweetness up front with a grapefruit-like characteristic all taken over by oily piny bitter hops, the hops definitely shine over the malt, although the caramel is hinting in. Syrupy full bodied mouth feel, a bit prickly on the back of the tongue from the carbonation and finishes sticky.","antlerwrestler19","Aug 31, 2011"

The smell of the beer is a bomb of hop aromas, everything from pine to citrus and some earth in there too. The taste is strong with hop flavors that instantly dry the mouth out and leave you wanting another sip. The mouthfeel of this beer is oily and has a nice thickness to it. Overall this beer is a must try for any hop head. Definitely worth checking out.","Knapp85","Aug 31, 2011"

Nothing overly complex, but delicious, and a very enjoyable drink. I think that the label stated 102 I.B.U.’s is a bit of a stretch but there are definitely a good amount of hops present. For me this would be “a session ale” (full confession, for me that means 64 oz. or less in an evening, of relatively high ABV beers). Lagunitas continues to impress me, mainly because I have located their better offerings.","JTSbeerislife","Aug 14, 2011"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Big ass hop smell. Sweet gooey hops burst out. It's all floral, citrus, toffee, and maybe pine. Flavor delivers all that in the aroma with a wallop. I like it. Those hops have free reign and thankfully the malt does its supporting role well by not being overly sweet or toffee like (some scorched sugar smell present).

Feel is medium to light with nice carbonation and pine resin. The initial taste is bitter hops and with a sweet caramel malt, on the way down I get a wave of pine hops, some malty sweetness, a little alcohol warmth followed by a nice grapefruit bitter lingering after flavor. Overall a very nice IIPA, it has the sweetness but it the high IBU makes up for that and you're left with plenty of hoppy goodness, this is a very nice IIPA, one of the better ones I've tried, this is way better than the Maximus, I wish I could find this in 6 packs, I'd get it far more frequent.","DavidST","Jul 26, 2011"

The balance and complexity that I get from this beer makes me proud to be a craft drinker in this country – only in America will you see a brewer go so deep with hop extract. An admirable offering from Lagunitas, and quite possibly the world’s best hop-forward beer made with extracts.","BarryMFBurton","Jul 25, 2011"
4.32,3.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability: A very tasty brew - and dangerous. The ABV is well hidden and I could easily see myself having another glass. If this is what hop extracts can yield in a DIPA, I think I like the extracts quite a bit. I can drink it by itself, and I could have it with a meal - but in this case I think the beer clashed a bit with the meal. I know some swear that spices and hops go together, but in the case of red beans and rice spiced up with Frank's hot sauce, it did not go well together. Oh well - not every beer pairing can go well. Still, a good beer and I can see why this beer is as highly rated as it is.

Lots of caramel and malt and pine come through on the palate, some secondary tropical fruit, mild bitterness but pretty juicy on the finish.

4.12,-1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a great hoppy beer. Intense aromas as soon as you start to pour into the glass. Aroma is more piney and woody than citrusy, but has a subtle sweet undertone to it. Pours a beautiful almost bourbon color, very clean thanks to the use of hop extracts. The bitterness of the first sip will certainly wake you and your tastebuds up. That bitterness is profound and lingering, but not overpowering or uncomfortable. There is a subtle sweetness that comes through mid-mouth to help balance out the intensity. The hoppy, bitter flavors linger nicely on the tongue and back of the mouth, allowing you to enjoy this beer over an extended period of time.","TBKeys","Jul 09, 2011"

The taste is similar and for being 102 I.B.U's this is quite a drinkable ale. As it warms up the melon characteristics are really prominent.

Not like it will turn me into a hop-head or anything as I wouldn't do this to my palate on a regular basis, but for what this beer is and in the style it is in, I can say that this is one of the best that I have ever had. I like Hercules and such because of the balance, and this beer somehow does the same thing. It doesn't finish malty, but finishes balanced and drinkable. I must say that I am impressed that they are able to "mask" >100 IBUs into a beer that is still palatable. Obviously their final additions of hops are also very liberal due to the obvious oils in the aroma...but this beer pulls it off well.

Its awesome how the flavor is more of a sweet bitterness rather than a dry sharp bitterness which is why some people might question the 102 IBU's.

As I said before in my review a definite hophead’s dream come true. A very solid offering that rivals some of the other great DIPA’s that I have tried in the past. For the price point I would definitely seek this one out again, well worth the $5 to try this one.","Roke87","May 20, 2011"

4.07,-2.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. This beer pours a nice golden/amber color with a thin creamy head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice lacing. The nose is well balanced with a nice up front crispness. Hop Stoopid has the smooth bitterness that is characteristic from highly hopped imperial IPAs, but I feel it lacks the floral notes on the finish that would come from using fresh hops over the extract. Mouth feel is silky smooth with almost no hint of alcoholo. Overall I would rate this as a very good experiment by Lagunita's into the Imperial/Double IPA realm. Their use of hop extract is impressive in it's execution and I feel that late time wet hopping just prior to fermentation would give this beer an exceptional characteristic that would push it into greatness.","x63x77","May 14, 2011"

4.2,0.2,4,4,4,4,5,"Pours a clear, slightly crimson golden color with a nice big white head. Pine and resin hop comes strongly off the nose with a nice malt balance. Smells really nice actually. The taste is a sweet malt balance to those same pine and resin hops. The original bite of the pine hops comes off almost fruity, but also with a hint of booze. Not as sweet as some DIPAs, which is welcome. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and some residual sweetness that hangs out on the tongue. Overall is a 5.0 with the bump because it is a $4 bomber. I mean, $4, seriously? This is not nearly the best IIPA I've ever had, but it has really nice pine flavor, is $4 and is much better than the attempts of a ton of different breweries attempt to make a decent IIPA.","seeswo","May 09, 2011"

Nose is a lot of mango and maybe a hit of citrus. The hops and malt meld together quite well here, although it leans a bit towards the sweeter side. Great mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on and the texture is nice and light. Easy to drink. Very bitter on the palate with more grapefruit than mango. The malt swoops in for a quick rescue from what would almost certainly be a brutally bitter finish. Still, nice, resiny hops outlast everything else and wreak havoc on the taste buds. They aren't heavy though. They walk that fine line where they are big enough to make a hop head smile and light enough for that same hop head to order two more rounds.","hoppyhampy","Apr 14, 2011"

Big citrus notes, and piney goodness dominate. The bottle promises an amazing 102 IBUs, so I'm not surprised at the lack of much malt presence. Taste follows the nose with an initial onslaught of wonderful hoppy bitterness. Citrus and pine intermingle in a bitter dance across my palate.

A great showcase beer for proving the talent of this brewery but probably not my go to double IPA.

The smell is a rich tropical freight train of hop love. So wonderful. Candied pineapple is dominant, with mango, passion fruit and guava. Awesome. Almost reminiscent of tropical fruit Skittles, my favorite kind. The taste cashes the check that the smell wrote, but it's more piney and bitter with citrus rind. The tropical fruit isn't as present, but the richness of the taste is wonderful. Resins dominate the tongue. A little heat from the ethyl, but not much.

This fades to a nice cap that can be roused quite easily in my snifter glass. Long clingy alcohol lacing as well. Smells big time of citrus, apricots, lemony hops, sweet carmel malts, some slight earthiness. Tastes very sweet at first, carmel, toffee. Mid palate I get earthy, piney, resinous hops. Some citrus and lemon. On this finish a nice smooth lingering, oily finish. Very balanced and very much what I like. Medium carbonation, full bodied. I'm going to easily finish this bomber myself.

On the nose there is a hop assault, orange zest, an over the top citrus vibe, oranges for miles. In the mouth it's a medium or medium thin body carrying the orange from the nose, perhaps a little more subdued here. There is a long finish of hop bitterness at the back of the mouth. It's a bit one-dimensional but it's a good dimension.

Pineapple, pear, apple, and hops all come through to me, with the hops and pineapple out front. Carbonation is fairly present on this beer as well. As hoppy as this beer is, the sweetness gives it a smoothness- and as a result it's extremely drinkable. I can't really taste much alcohol either, it's very well masked.

As the beer is swirled in the snifter there is a good amount of lace left behind. The smell is strong in citrus fruits, a delicious nose of hops. Make no mistake this is a hop bomb in every sense of the word. The taste continues the nose with a very strong hop taste a little malt sweetness that doesn't quite balance with the hops, bu that's alright with me.

The taste is rather balanced for a big imperial IPA. Lagunitas does a good job with malts to balance out the high levels of bittering hops. The taste is where you get hit with pine bittering hops. It's drinks exceptionally easy for a large beer. Overall, this beer is meant to showcase hops. If you're a hop-head check out this beer.

Taste follows the nose with bright Clementine, orange peel, some toffee and cookie dough sweetness, and a punchy, acidic juiciness to finish.

It has a really nice bready malt backbone that balances this beer well. there is also a nice carbonation level that makes this really cleansing. not super fresh tasting, but the hops are prominent and really give this a hop forward dryness on the palate. The drinkability also has a high score for me because its not super high alcohol, though it is strong, its drinkable and feels like a 6% beer rather than an 8th.

Pours a nice orange hue, unfiltered yet damn near crystal-clear, with medium carbonation and a half inch of whitish head that leaves a bit of lacing. Orange and pineapples dominate the aroma, with floral and perfumy notes following close behind. No real malt aroma, but this is certainly OK for the style. Nothing but hops on the palate - in a very good way. The orange, tropical fruits, mint?, tobacco? and coating resiny/oily stickiness overwhelms the whisper of honeyed malt sweetness, which then leads into a very potent, yet incredibly smooth bitterness that lingers on and on. It has moderate carbonation, and its somewhat substantial body does not hamper its drinkability in any way. This brew is too easy to drink - it packs loads of hop flavor without overloading the malt bill with crystal malts just to make it drinkable. Well-worth trying this one out.","mmmbeer","Jan 09, 2011"

While the freshness of a bottle may leave some doubts, when tasted on-draft and from the source this beer is impressive. The intensity of the hop aromas alone are irresistible. While I thought that kegged Hop Stoopid was a unique occurrence at the source, a stop at the Santa Rosa Whole Foods and their amazing 14-tap beer bar showed that it does travel.

I started by pouring this into my snifter glass and taking a big whiff. The aroma is all hops, specifically floral and pine. Smell goes on for days, and is pretty much incredible. Not too much of a head on this one, though what little there is clings desperately to the sides of the glass. Pretty high level of bitterness in this beer (it claims over 100 IBUs on the bottle), but it doesn't punch you in the face like others. In fact, there's a nice malt sweetness at the end of the whole affair. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, though it doesn't gum up your tongue like others can do. Carbonation is pretty flat, which isn't a shock considering the style. As you continue to partake the bitterness does increase. As you do that the hop bouquet opens up, with lots of floral, grassy, and pine flavors shining through. Beyond that is some tart malt sweetness chased by heavy hop bitterness ending in a sticky and somewhat sweet, yet clean, finish. I wonder if the tartness and the clean finish has to do with how this was fermented. No real alcohol presence comes through in this beer, which is kind of surprising considering the ABV (8%) and style. Must be under the layers of hops. Overall this is a very solid and very drinkable double IPA. Quite enjoyable.","eclaycamp","Oct 28, 2010"

At 102 IBU I expected way more than I got..even at a warmer temperature it did not have that bite I was expecting/wanted. The carbonation of the brew coats the pallet with a lot of hops, a very good balance of carbonation to flavor is present in this beer.

The smell jumps out at you, with huge citrusy and piney hops, along with some honey, fruity esters, bread dough, chalk and alcohol. The flavor also has a big, juicy hop component upfront (notes of pine, grapefruit, pineapple), along with a honey sweetness, chalky astringence, fruity esters, bread dough and alcohol.

Lots of tropical fruits are here, I got some pineapple, mango and peach, but the list goes on. Taste is awesome, starts initially with the sweet and solid malt base upfront, gradually fading into a hop attack, where the flavour opens up and matches the aroma in terms of the tropical bouquet. Just so goddamn tasty. Mouthfeel is great; full, medium to low carbonation and a LONG lasting bitter and dry finish. By long, I mean that from the point I left my girlfriend's house (where we imbibed) to the point I got home, over an hour later this bitter, dry cottonmouth effect lingered.

The flavor is sticky and crisp with floral hops up front finishing mildly bitter with pine and grapefruit. Could use a little malt to provide a little more balance.

The smell is hoppy and intense, and I caught a hint of sweet malt. Lagunitas has really outdone themselves with this beer.The beer has a decent malt backbone and a sticky thick mouthfeel. The flavor profile is intense and dynamic. The front end is piny, followed by a grapefruit middle and ended at the back of my tongue is a smooth bitter that only gets better with every drink.

This beer pours a clear, bright copper with a bushy white head that leaves massive creamy circles all the way down the glass. I don't know what it is about a well-made DIPA's being the most attractive beer style. It seems like it is very rare to see a DIPA look like crap. The aroma is citrus mixed with a little pine and just a hint of pale malts. Definite notes of grapefruit pith, lemon, tangerines and freshly cut pine trees. The flavor is extremely one sided. Hops, hops and more hops. Big grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, and just a bit of mango. There is just a hint of biscuity sweetness coming through on the middle of flavor profile. Hop Stoopid finishes with a sharp hop bitterness leaving the palate screaming for another sip. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter then I had expected with a very light carbonation. To me, I think this is the best beer for the money. A double deuce of a 8% Double IPA for $3.99!

Brew poured to a nice golden color with what I perceive as red highlights. Good sized white head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma is fantastic; the hop aroma is simply fantastic with the citrus smell that highlights grapefruit. That hop mixes well with the sweet malt aroma, very inviting! The flavor, while good, does not live up to my expectations based on the nose. The hop flavor dominates with some very nice fruit like flavors, orange and grapefruit mostly, though I really thought they would linger longer on the back of the tongue. The malt is there but in my opinion it gives off too much of a sweet flavor, a little to much of a coying toffee flavor. Now I had not realized that this was a DIPA, it just did not feel like one as it seemed to be a little thin, I only realized it when I was looking here. Overall a fair brew at a good price point, I would get this one again mostly due to the nose.","Stimack","Jan 16, 2010"

What can I say I love SoCal music and there's a band called Slightly Stoopid who have the whole reggae vibe, I could picture these guys from Lagunitas really digging their albums like Chronchitis it's almost like the Censored ale aka the Chronic. I don't know who inspired who, but let's smell this brew. Full on herbal goodness in the nose a bit of Cali kind bud pungency if you ask me but it's a nice ball of citrus herbal and grassy tones that give it a real balls out hop extract nose. Flavor is again pungent with hops a concentrated version of hop bitterness, pine, citrus, and floral tones burst together into one cohesive force of hops. Bitter blanket of alpha acids with a nice sweetness underneath finishes pretty dry with bitterness, as mentioned before priced very affordable for us hopheads. I've tried this beer for the last two years prior and have always been impressed but this may be the first year for the hop extract version. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with the hop oils really coating the palate it makes you breathe burp and smell hops in between sips, a new experience that I won't forget soon. Drinkability despite the intense flavors and textures this beer delivers on the drinkability factor it pulls it off for sure keeps me interested the entire time, a beer I would love to drink more often I'll have to set it aside as a special occasion hop harvest brew even though it holds up nicely well into December.","WVbeergeek","Dec 10, 2009"

It starts out very fruity with some hints of canned peaches but finishing out on the bitter end with more hops. This isn't as big of a hop bomb as the smell suggested but it still has a decent punch.

Another weird taste I found was a hint of orange marmalade on toast. Also a taste of fruit/orange pastry dusted with a hint of powdered sugar. I like orange marmalade on toast and I like a decent pastry here and there, but I'm not sure that's what I want from a beer. If you like a bold, slightly syrupy, citrus fruit tasting drink, be my guest. Or, just mix an Old Fashioned and cut out the middle man. This would be good on pancakes, or served with pancakes.

Bright copper color, good carbonation, clear, well settled sediment left in the bottle. Big hop nose, specifically citrus and pine. Taste is definately hop forward, fresh, grapefruit and pine, backed by a great malt structure, more malt comes through than I was expecting from a beer with this name, maybe this isn't as fresh as I had hoped.

The dryness is quick and everlasting and leaves me wanting more. The bitterness and alcohol are definitely strong but certainly not overwhelming.

Decent head retention, followed by a central, light skim of foam and some thin, delicate sheets of lacing around 3/4's of the bowl. Nose reveals sweet grapefruit and perhaps a hint of caramel or toffee in the mix. Sweet character is somewhat diminished in the mouth, however still present. Some citrus astringency up front, followed by a piny/resinous, slightly medicinal quality in the middle, and finishing with some sweetness, and a lightly lingering bitterness at the end - not getting too much of a suggestion of malt throughout, although its presence is definitely detectable. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied with carbonation that is slightly prickly on the middle of tongue, but picks up towards the finish. Easy drinking with a balance that leans slightly more towards the bitter side of the style, but not in an off-putting manner. ABV is well-hidden at 8% as well. Also, can't beat the price - I think I paid $3.99 or $4.99 for a bomber. I haven't had too much from this brewery, but definitely a quality offering.","Jwale73","Aug 30, 2009"

I get a cotton candy like sweetness as I drink. I also taste orange juice, carmel, and white chocolate. All rolled up into a nice bitter package. Delicious.

The taste...starts out with all those floral hops notes, but then leaves off very bitter and tasting almost like soap. After that great smell, I found the taste quite disappointing. I'll have to try this on tap somewhere and see if I get the same effect or if it's something to do with the bottled version.

I was scared that I'd be drinking something that tasted like a blend of Pine-Sol and Dogfish Head 90 Minute, but Lagunitas hit a home run with this one. The hops are perfectly distributed between aroma, flavor and bittering. Classic California IPA hops dance throughout the bouquet--resinous and with tight citrus notes--with deeper, mustier hints rounding it out. I think I detect the interesting, wild vegetal hops Warrior in there, blanketed behind the Cascades. The taste starts off slightly sweeter than I expected, but finishes with the same hop flavors as the aromas advertise. Final bittering note is long and delightful, complex and evolving. Starts out pineappley for just a moment and then heads into spicy dustbowl territory with bitter grapefruit pith. And for only $4.99 for a 22 oz bottle, I see myself stocking up on this one.","TheNapkin","Jul 03, 2009"

4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is profoundly hoppy crispy, oily, juicy resinous hop pine notes. There isn't the orange burst or the florals with the hops in this case and there is a bit of imbalance in that the bready and biscuity malty base does not entirely complement the enormous hop presence. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. The hops and the hop juices really warm the cockles after things settle in a bit. At first blush, the beer was just over the top hoppy, but it became more warming and endearing as it settled. The aftertaste is quite strong and bittering, the mouthfeel isn't particularly oily from the resin of the hop. This is well worth seeking out if you want a serious hop experience.

Taste: sweet citrus, grapefruit, piney and leafy. For all of the IBUs, the bitterness is not overpowering and the sweet biscuity malt comes through nicely.

When this stuff hits your mouth, its a big-time hop blast - lots of grapefruit bitterness - a little bit of the tropical citrus sweetness is there but not as key a component as in the aroma; there's also a noticeable amount of resinous flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and full bodied. Probably seems a little lighter because of the high carbonation (zing!). Its definitely a mouth-coating ale, and is also a touch oily.

When I read people referring to a piney flavor I always know what they mean, but it is like a description utilizing an approximation; a best guess. This, however, was the real deal. It smelled like a walk through the woods around my house up in Maine. A mixture of fresh spruce and white pine needles carpeting the floor. Another memory that flashed to mind was decorating a Christmas tree. All that amazing smell trapped in a small, candlelit living room with snow piling up and frost crystallizing against the window pane. It is an alluring smell and if women wore perfume like this I would have trouble concentrating on anything. Ever. The taste had more of that tasty pine zest along with a fruity backbone. It ended with an excellent dry finish.","GreatPondBrewer","Jun 14, 2009"

This brew is hoppy, a little more bitter than a PtE which I just had, but a solid malt flavor to keep it from being overbearing. This hop bomb deserves to be in the elite with the x2IPAs as they've managed to balance bitterness with flavor and some sweetness in there as well. Not quite as good as PtE but close.

The aroma is absolutely gigantic, piles and piles of floral and citrusy hops, though not as powerfully grapefruity as has become fashionable lately. The hops have a bit more pine, a little lemon. But still vast. The flavor follows along precisely, all hops all the time, rolling waves of flower, pine, and citrus. The alcohol is muted and the grain is largely lost behind the wall of hops. The one weak poitn is the mouthfeel - it is excessively sticky and resiny, leaving a sticky sweetness around the lips, which is great for a soda but a little weird in a beer.","Seanibus","Jun 05, 2009"

The beer displays truth in advertising: The flavor initially is a pure pine bomb with only a slight malt sweetness to provide balance. After the hops put on their prolonged one-note show of rich bitterness, the complexity emerges. The finish takes on your taste buds from all sides, giving your throat a dry smack with a bit of citrus sweetness on the tongue. If you don't enjoy a big hop show, give this one a pass. I usually prefer a little more malt balance in a DIPA, but I like this one. If you enjoy a beer that mixes brute force with just a bit of grace, Hop Stoopid is well worth your time. Pair with sweet & sour pork or a sweeter Thai dish such as pad see ew.","chicagobeerriot","Jun 01, 2009"

Very light haze to the metallic zinc orange hue, glows warmly, the rims retain more orange than yellow. The nose is undoubtedly hoppy but in no way lacks for honey molasses, caramel tones, this in turn sweetens the orange, pink grapefruit citrus as well as the floral dew, the peach, apricot, apple fruit cruises below the radar, really nothing exaggerated nor "stoopid" about this array of scents. Full-bodied, fluffy carbonation lacks precision but fills up the mouth with breadth. Honeyed bread, caramel, molasses meet up with a certain mineral water freshness to staunch excess sweetness. The hoppiness here is strong but nothing unusual, just loads up on the grains, grasses and thick yeasts. Some ginger and pine but, overall, doesn't look to bite real hard.

I've had pale ales that "taste" more bitter, despite the 102 IBU scrawled across the top of the label. This is a fairly hyped beer and I was afraid it wasn't gonna live up to it but it does.

The taste is starts off with some fruitiness that gives way to some piney hops and then some citrus rind the in finish. The whole time the malt does a pretty good job of balancing everything out. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation.

A bit acidic and a little gassy. Alcohol well handled. There was something missing, I wondered if the malt didn't weigh in enough to balance the hops, it was a bit sour as well. Still, overall, representative of the style and well worth a try.","ThatWineGuy","May 15, 2009"

Starts off with juicy grapefruit citrus and piny hops, quickly balanced by pale crystal malts and a bit of honey. Bitterness lingers long into the finish, but never becomes acerbic or over-bearing. Near perfect mouthfeel, with a bubbly medium body that's both crisp and refreshing. Great drinkability, too; I'm not only looking forward to the second half of this bomber, but I can't wait for the 2nd bomber I purchased today.

I knew this was gonna be good before I even took a drink. Taste is a domination of the citrusy/piney hops. There is a muted malt note in there as well. I was hoping for a touch more of the hop bomb taste because of the beautiful scent, but this beer is still very good. The 8% ABV was unnoticeable.

I detect some bubble gum, molasses and candied pineapple is prominent. Also fresh white grapefruit and some herbal/earthy notes surface. The slightly bitter finish plays off of the sweet flavors to create an amazing overall flavor. The creamy body adds to this beer's likeability. This is a superior DIPA because it is not just bitter, it really showcases the superpowers of the hops flower.

To be fair, there is also some tropical, fruity sweet malt in the front end, but it mixes well with the pineapple and citrus flavors of the hops. Big resin and pineapple hop flavors feature mid-palate. Orange marmalade and grapefruit citrus flavors follow up. Bitterness throughout, but not too numbing. This is largely about huge hop flavor, not bitterness, and I am really liking it! Smooth, creamy feel on a medium-full body.

The flavor is balanced to favor hop character over bitterness, which is as it should be. The downside is that the flavor is almost cloyingly sweet and the extreme fruitiness of the hops exacerbates this characteristic. The somewhat soapy bitterness also hurts drinkability.

Very resiny pine, grapefruit, citrus notes, cantaloupe, sweet candied malts, lots of stuff going on. Reminds me of Southern Tier Unearthly bot a little less cloying sweetness.

A fresh piney hop flavor, with some grapefruit notes, that ends with a littly resiny bitterness. Enough of a malt sweetness to balance out any bitterness. The feel is moderate, ever so slight chewy body, a notch below fizzy carbonation. Almost a perfect malt balance to the hops. A real enjoyable DIPA, not too malty sweet and some nice hop flavors.

Immediate attack of heavy grapefruit pith on the tongue, with a slick, oily body. Carbonation is appropriately low and drinkability is... well... for hopheads only. Resinous pine comes through on a second swig, and a light acidity and sweetness dance on the tip of the tongue. Yum.","allergictomacros","May 01, 2009"

My initial taste throws me for a loop-sweeter than I expected for a double IPA-most certainly not hop heavy in the taste. Finishes sweet with a little hop bitterness. Slippery and oily going down, carbonation is light which gives the beer a medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is very good, because the hops are not overwhelming.","bradybeer","Apr 30, 2009"

Head retention is fantastic, fading eventually into a thick film and leaving thick sheets of lacing behind. Nose is rather complex - there is a wonderful blend of pine, citrus and floral hops that are all so prevalent that it took me a long time to realize it was in fact all three. Taste lends slightly more to the citrusy hops, with floral and pine hops mixing in to give a well balanced hop blend that just hits you! Hops aren't the only flavoring to this brew, there is a nice caramel malt blend that balances this beer out. The beer is medium bodied, lighter on the carbonation. Mouthfeel is quite sticky, somewhat filling but not too filling. If it weren't for the ABV, I would sit with this puppy all night - even still the drinkability is quite nice!","Jayli","Apr 29, 2009"

If I had wanted something hoppy and sweet, I'd have pulled a DFH 120 out of the cabinet. Indeed, this kinda brings to mind a weaker, less complex 120 Minute Mini-Me.

Very clear, vibrantly orange with a large and particularly fluffy and foamy head. This beer also has a lot of rising bubbles going on, like soda, and keeps it up almost the whole time it took me to drink it, which wasn't long. Again, unique. Super resiny lacing as well. Smells strongly of piney, citrusy hops. Taste however is much less bitter than I would have thought, given the pungent nose. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing. All hops. Big, luscious, juicy fruity pineapple melon mango hops. No pine bitterness at all as suggested on the first whiff. It's really crazy how much raw hop flavor this beer has yet such a low bitterness, though it claims 102 IBUs 4 U right on the label. Must have something to do with the hop extraction technique they used. Taking the actual physical hop out of the beer and adding it in extracted syrup form is an interesting idea, and I think they may be on to something. Slight honey sweetness (I hear it's infused with honey) and a faint pale malt. I could've easily given the taste a 5, but I tend to like bitter beers actually so I wouldn't mind a little more bite. But then it would just be another good but un-unique double IPA, and this beer is more than that. Super soft mouthfeel, light and airy. Almost feels like beer flavored air going down my throat. Highly drinkable can't get enough want it all the time. As a note, the label states a 7.7% abv while this site says 8.2%.

There's a twisted licorice but it's pretty much about the hop overload. A bit much for me without having any malt balance. But it's certainly worth a try for the hopheads. Nice body, fair carbonation, crisp and pretty unique. Just sort of mutated hops in the flavor here that makes it less drinkable for me.

It's perfectly clear, and the bubbles look loose and float on top like clouds, and leaves minimal lacing. Looks pretty spot on to me. The smell is nice - tropical fruits, a bit of sweet citrus, lemon/lime, with a bit of hop resin and plenty of floral notes. I can even smell a bit of sweet, powdery malts. Overall a very good smell for a DIPA, but not overwhelming by any means. The flavor is good too. I actually don't get any hint of harsh bitterness as expected, but more of a resinousy bitterness, mixed in with quite a strong, sweet malty backbone, almost raisiny or honey-flavored. Very clean with plenty of hop flavor. There's the sweet fruity taste, like plums, apples, sweet lime, and mango. The resinous feel clings to my mouth and beer exits with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is quite nice, a bit powdery and not incredibly full, but the leafy hop presence is pleasant. The lower ABV, marked as 7.7%, mixed with the decent balance (for the style), makes this one a nice drinker. There are others I'd choose over this (only a few really), but really a great effort, recommended to all and a pretty good price for a DIPA.","taylorhamrick","Mar 17, 2009"

Full of citrus aromas such as orange, grapefruit, tangerines, and pineapple. Big hop flavors as well. Mostly citrus with just a hint of earthy mustyness lingering in the background. That mustyness is the only hint of malt which does not seem to be important in this style. Bitterness is high without being overwhelming and harsh. Has a very good mouthfeel. Big body with low carbonation. Almost a soft texture which is unusual for a bitter brew. Almost all other brewers of DIPA's should figure out how Lagunitas got this mouthfeel.

A very smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied DIPA that has a great hop bite to it (finishes dry) and is balanced w/ a slight sweet malt sensation.

Lagunitas just takes such care of its beers from the outside in and the bottom up. I don't work there or have anything to do with the company! And I live in Portland, where we have so many fine brewers. But I'll grab any new Lag I spot at the store. And that's another big thing to love -- Lagunitas is always coming out with new and special beers. And (unlike many other brewers) they keep 'em all at the same price, even the high-gravity, high-hops ones. Like this beaut, Hop Stoopid. I tried it at a beer festival this summer and dug it. Finally get to peacefully drink 22 oz in my own home. Hops galore, lotsa alcohol too, but all so gracefully blended into the full experience. Even if you don't usually like the IIPAs you might try this one.

Goes down easily, perhaps overly so, alcohol hidden in the fine balance of flavor. Nose becomes more pineapple as it warms, and finish begins to add more malt to the mix.

Bitterness obvious on the first couple of sips but settles down afterwards to more of an afterthought. Medium to full bodied...creamy, velvety.

Palate is full of bitter, floral hops up front, balanced by a faintly sweet malt character. Finish is full of grass and grapefruit, with a lasting bitterness. Body is slightly sticky, just about perfect for the style. While the alcohol isn't exactly integrated, it's not really a problem.

4.42,5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked up a couple of bottles upon arrival at the store. The beer pours a crystal-clear amber with a one-inch head that settles to a few millimeters. Carbonation is vigorous, but very fine. The aroma is extremely hoppy. Citrus notes and pine overwhelm all, but there is a sweet malty note in the backround. The taste is very green with hops. Grapefruit and pine are distinct, along with other fruity flavors. It finishes dry, yet balanced with malt. This beer is medium bodied, and resinous hops coat the palate and linger for a long time after each sip. Hop Stoopid is a beer suitable for any hophead. 102 IBUs at only 7.7% ABV? Somehow this works. And the price is very reasonable as well.","WYVYRN527","Feb 26, 2009"

It tasted like pine and rose hops with some juniper and fresh peppercorn, and lingering honey sweetness. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a smooth bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty interesting beer, almost like if Sierra Nevada made an imperial IPA but better. It had that same pine character, but it was brewed with much more skill and delicate touch than Sierra tends to provide. The beer seems like an unbalanced hop bomb at first, but then it ends with incredible malty sweetness, and an overall very clean taste. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol well under the big flavors. This beer is better to sip, but is very enjoyable to drink. Great value, too!","Pencible","Feb 25, 2009"

Yes, there's some sweet maltiness in the nose, but it's completely out done by the pine and light citrus. Flavor is pretty good. For 102 IBUs I was expecting a lot more bitterness, but this is more hop flavor than bitterness to me. It's mostly pine with maybe some hints of citrus, and solid pale malt backbone with a biscuit/cracker like character. Medium to full bodied, average carbonation.

Pungent and citrusy hops create a medley of aromas including notes of almond, hay, and a looming earthy funk quality. Hoppy as hell, but a great balance of the hops, very bitter-sweet. Coating sweet malts balance the fresh and citrusy yet resinous and piney hop overload and create a long pleasant aftertaste after its dry and fruity finish. The nose continues to get even more farm house funky as it opens up, also new notes of peach, melon, strawberry, and floral yeasty esters come through. Mellow carbonation overall but just enough to still deliver a strong bite, instead of the beer falling dull in the mouth. Medium body, decent chew and excellently coating. Impressive drinkability, alcohol heat is no where in sight. Truly a wonderful beer from Lagunitas i wish we got here in NJ.","ATPete","Nov 10, 2008"

This is a well-balanced DIPA, not too sweet, and bitter in the English style with modest but evident carbonation. As it warms, that bitterness becomes even more apparent on the back of the tongue, and smoky, pine resin flavors emerge.

I was expecting the taste to be like their Maximus, but this was a lot more assertive with an up front bitterness, toasty caramel malt, and a lingering finish. The body was a little thin for DIPA, but that's hardly ever the point of the style anyway.

It has a big, bitter hop bite at the start and it pretty much carries through to the end. The malt create some balance, but not enough IMO. It goes down easy and resinates on the tongue. It seems a bit thin in the finish. It hides the 8% abv. well. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker, but could use a bit more malts and body. It's just a little too thin for my taste.","WesWes","Jan 17, 2008"

I rate it a 4 on appearance only because it becomes next to lifeless in a hurry (S/B 4.25). The amount of tangerine grapefruit citrus aroma is amazing! Big and aggressive. The mouth feel is surprisingly on the lighter side of medium, an oily orange citrus character, that lingers nicely, combined with a sweet doughy note of malts (4.25). I'm a big fan of the bitter hop resin flavor. The sweetness seems to remind me more of fruity than of a malty sweetness. Close to a 5.0 IMO. Very drinkable with a chill, the blast of pure hoppiness at room temperature is not for the week of heart. The 8.2% ABV is well integrated.

Poured a very nice hazy and murky golden amber color with a very nice two inch plus head of foamy lace and a decent amount of suspended particles. The head faded slowly leaving behind copious amounts of side glass lace. The smell was overloaded with floral citrus hops that just exploded with aromas of tangerine and orange with the slightest touch of pine thrown in. The flavor was so remarkably smooth and fresh; it was in a word wonderful. A full on floral hop assault that just did not let up. Great stickiness and dryness to the fell and a taste that was very bright and full of orange and pineapple flavors with the right amount of sugar thrown in for good measure. This was just great, a really nice hopheads IPA and a very smooth brew indeed. I almost found this one to be sessionable, but the ABV will steer you away from that, even though you could not pick up the slightest touch of it in there. Overall this was a really fine beer for sure. I enjoyed every last sip of this sticky resin filled taste. I would have to highly recommend this one to anyone out there that really loves the hops, this will not disappoint.","mikesgroove","Nov 06, 2007"

Nice creamy citrus hop scent with with an earthy fresh topsoil as well. Good pine tingle that remains throughout. Taste is s full thick gritty hop flavors with some evergreen as well. A bit of caramel malt is noticable which gives a small amount of balance Big dry grassy flavors in the end. To sum this one up, it's an earthy hop bomb.

Poured a clean, pale, golden copper color that had great clarity. About a finger and a half of bright white, bubbly head formed, with a bit of a vigorous pour. Had decent retention and left plenty of clingy lace on the glass. Smell was very strong in the hops department, and heavy on the grapefruit and other citrus. Nice malty notes in the background with again more citrus. Had a rather strong nose to it. Taste was strong on the hops with yet again tons of grapefruit. Also present were lemon zest, grass, yeast, bread, layered nicely on a sweet malt backbone. Hops had a strong almost chemical like taste to them, but strangely wasn't in a bad way. This brew was actually pretty well balanced in my opinion. A good shot of alcohol and plenty of fizzy carbonation finished this beer rather dry. Seems to calm down after a few sips.

4.08,-2.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Golden honey color, small, but attractive soft white head. Smells of sweet leafy floral hops. Tastes of orange zest and citrus oils with most of the hops up front, and milder on the finish. The mouth feel hints at the malts I can't seem to taste in here. The drinkability is good and the alcohol presence is well integrated with the other flavors (at a cooler temp. at least) A classic "balanced in its lack of balance" west coast DIPA. I really like it, and still marvel that I bought it in a 7-11, which is unheard of in my neck of the woods. I am visiting the Bay Area, and I am quite pleased with the ubiquity of Lagunitas in all the corner stores around here.","dedrinker","Jul 12, 2007"
4.29,2.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Very robust but drinkable, very good for a 2IPA.","Halcyondays","Jul 02, 2007"
4.37,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"D: Very drinkable due to the outstanding balance and medley of flavors. The problem is that the 8.2% gets you in the end. An outstanding DIPA.","willjschmidt","Jun 27, 2007"
4.54,8.4,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"While the flavor of this brew does not quite live up to the aromatics emanating from this beer, this is certainly the most enjoyable brew I have ever had from Lagunitas (though I should warn you that it may take a particular breed, a hop head certainly, to enjoy the characteristics of this brew. I wonder how much of my enjoyment of this brew is situational? I'll definitely have to try this again, but it is really hitting the spot right now; this is the last beer after a night of drinking malt focused brews. While my head may certainly be feeling the effects of the alcohol content, the aroma and flavor hide it amazingly well and make me think that I could quaff this brew pints at a time; a dangerous situation I might almost feel lucky enough to experience until the next morning. I am quite pleased; it is rare that the beer I end up with at the end of a night of a rating marathon (anything over three beers qualifies for me), is the best brew of the night. In fact I better score this beer now, as the longer I drink this and the more the alcohol effects me, the higher it score is going to rise. Actually on that note, this makes me think that I need to revist a lot of beers from my ratings past so that I can down-grade them.","Gueuzedude","Jun 13, 2007"
3.9,-6.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3,"D: At 8% and the smack in the face with a pine tree, this is one area where this beer dips in score. Definitely worth a pick up every once and a while but I can't imagine picking up a 6er of this. Definitely better suited to a bomber style.","ChillMike","Jun 10, 2007"
4.03,-3.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, an excellent beer, and I would happily drink it again. Given how well hidden the ABV is, I could even see drinking a few of these in one session.","","Jun 08, 2007"
4.28,2.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: Once again Lagunitas produces a top notch brew and doesn't try and bust our bank. Well priced, excellent brew. Will seek out in the future.","DogFood11","Jun 02, 2007"
4.42,5.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"This is a wonderful release from Lagunitas Farmhouse. First had this one on tap at the Bistro DIPA festival in Hayward. In judging, this beer came in right behind Pliny the Elder. It comes in at 8.2 percent ABV and 100-plus IBU. This beer is made from 100% hop extract.","jamdugan","May 22, 2007"
3.7,-11.7,4,4,4,3,3,"Very citrusy and sappy. Big fluffly white head atop a tangerine body with moderate haze (not from the sediment). Very appealing hop bouquet with tons of citrus rind. The mouthfeel let me down with this beer, as it is a hair too thick and sticky and brings down the drinkability. Probably lots of hop products in this beer, like oils and such. Great for a hop bomb, but I really don't care for the heavy body at all. It doesn't show the alcohol very much, except for the heavieness of the malts. Recommended, but probably one I won't revisit soon. Cheers!","rayjay","May 13, 2007"
4.07,-2.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a beautiful clear golden-yellow. Smells from 2 feet away like hops and deep malt. Taste and mouthfeel are a little light for a double IPA, but that could be because so many are so big. Definitely bigger than an IPA and leaves that hoppy resin aftertaste for a long time in your mouth that a good double IPA should. Easy to drink with lots of taste. Pick one up if you like hoppy west coast beers.","Murchmac","Apr 22, 2007"
4.34,3.6,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Silkiness after the carbonation settles down. Still very drinkable and highly enjoyable.","Cresant","Apr 04, 2007"
4.32,3.1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was skeptical of the hop extract ingredients, but I really enjoy this beer. I loved it on tap at the Bistro DIPA Festival in Hayward, and was delighted that the bottle (reviewed here) lived up to that promise. Can't wait until it gets broader distribution - of DIPAs, this and Marin Brewing's White Knuckle will be staples in my fridge.","Talisker","Mar 20, 2007"
4.3,2.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear amber, nice chunky white head forms, nice lacing all over, great retention, looks pretty good. Smell is hops up the wazoo, lots of pine and cedar, floral hops, some grains and caramel, overpowering hoppiness though, the way I like it. Taste is similar, enough malt to keep it drinkable, but pretty great piney resinous hops, super nice, bitterness is perfect, really coats the mouth. Mouthfeel is full bodied, quite thick, something I enjoyed about it, low carbonation, easy to drink for the ABV and bitterness, best Lagunitas I've had yet and would glady put down again. Thanks!","Viggo","Mar 18, 2007"

4.62,10.3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- Damn near greatness. Not much wrong with this beer. I almost wrote it off before trying it. Tasty and very very thirst quenching. Flavors just dance together.","GClarkage","Mar 11, 2007"
4,-4.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A clear bright beer with a nice lingering head giving off great hop scents of grapefruit, kiwi and caramel. The taste is also very nice with a long dry hop bitterness and at 100 IBUs it is not overpowering. A nice offering and a great beer to pair with some spicy food. The Saison is next.","lou91","Mar 06, 2007"
