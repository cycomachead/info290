Feels like a hefty, boozy, syrupy barley wine than anything.  I'll still seek out a fresh bottle this year, but I think this doesn't age as gracefully as 120 minute does.  I'm expecting I would prefer this fresh since any hop notes in this 10 month bottle are subdued by everything else.","Tuck_leepulin","Mar 11, 2015"

With a fairly mild malt aroma and bitterness out of this world, it leaves a carmel aftertaste that was more than what I expected. This does result in the usual IPA hoppiness being overrun by the malts. Slightly silky mouthfeel but no sticky residual. Went well with the calamari I ordered as an appetizer and even better with the rack of lamb.","CrucialBlue","Feb 04, 2015"

Hops have faded, leaving some notes of a candied orange peel and straw lingering around. The flavor has a surprisingly rounded bitterness that hits midpalate with a drying finish and just enough malt to give it some definition without feeling heavy. So: do I wish I had this fresh? Yes, of course. But am I disappointed that the only taste I have of it is one from a bottle half a year old? Not in the least.","elNopalero","Dec 16, 2014"

This is a TRIPLE IPA, which I believe is deserving of it's own category.  The malt bill is heavy duty, the hops in equal proportion.  Beers of this ilk, cross the bridge between American Barleywine and DIPA, and that's exactly where you will find Devil Dancer.  Fruity, tangy, cirtrusy hoppy, malty....yes you've got all of theseys.   Oops, I'm stuck.  Not a hint of alcohol while weighing in at 12% ABV with 112 IBUs.  This beer is an EXPERIENCE, not just another DIPA.  Next year, when you buy your four pack, drink two and let another two sit for 4-5 months.

Some hops presence in the nose but nothing typical of the major hop bombs on the market. More caramel in the taste. Some citrus hop in the finish but it really competes with the malt body and fails. Tastes more like an imperial Amber or red than anything. A slight alcohol bite can be noticed in the finish as well. Rich mouthfell. This is a big beer and the malt body lIves up to that. Overall this is pretty good but not as an IPA. Maybe an imperial hoppy Amber ale. Is that a thing?","ILMbrew","Sep 28, 2014"

Taste is floral hops, citrus and grapefruit flavors with sweet caramel malt, has a bit of toffee notes as well as it warms up. Palate is a medium full body, a smooth mouth feel and good carbonation. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt toffee flavor followed by floral, citrus and grapefruit notes. The ending is somewhat sweet dry bitterness with a bit of toffee on the end for balance Seems slightly on the bitter side, alcohol seems well hidden but hits you in the end. Overall a good flavorful and good drinking brew.","Samp01","Sep 26, 2014"

4.25,9,,,,,,"Poured a rich, semi-cloudy amber body with no head, but a thin ring of off-white lace. Quite nice looking, like a good Barleywine. Scents of rich, sweet malt with notes of caramel, brown sugar and molasses, strong fruity esters reminiscent of overripe stone fruit, moderate-high scents of alcohol, and an underlying hop aroma with notes of pine, indeterminate citrus and faint tropical fruit. Overall impression is of an aroma that is far more weighed towards the malty sweet and boozy end of the scale than the hop side. It reminds one of a strong English Barleywine. Quite pleasant. Flavor begins strongly sweet with notes of caramel, overripe fruit and a bit of alcohol balanced by faint hop bitterness. This moves into a still sweet middle with notes of caramel, rum-soaked fruit, medium levels of bitter hops and alcohol. Finish is still sweet, with notes of caramel, brown sugar, rum-soaked fruit, a bit of indeterminate citrus peel and flesh, alcohol and a still medium level of bitter hops. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of bitter, piney hops, dried apricot, toasted malt and alcohol warmth. Overall impression is of a rich, malty profile, balanced by alcohol warmth and a nice level of hops that shine on the aftertaste. Very much a Barleywine is impression and quite the good one. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with moderate-low carbonation and a sticky, chewy mouthfeel with a slight alcohol warmth. Overall impression is of a classic Barleywine mouthfeel that is warming and pleasant. Overall this is a nice Barleywine. It shines in aroma and flavor, and is aided by its mouthfeel. It hits the style quite well and trends more towards the malty sweet variety. Hops and alcohol keep it from becoming cloying, which helps the overall impression of the beer. Quite nice and highly recommended.","Auraan","Sep 07, 2014"

The alcohol profile is much more forward, grainy and boozy with a muted peppery and herbal hop profile. The flavor is similar, although much of the edgier hop profile has faded and a slightly fruitier and herbal hop profile remains, it doesn't remedy the booziness that has been revealed within this beer by time. The texture is slightly less clean, mildly chewy and peppery. Alcohol presence is moderate, and murky grain is amongst the many imperfections this beer has. Miles away a less favorable beer than the fresh vintage, nearly a drainpour! Drink as fresh as possible!","Jadjunk","Aug 27, 2014"

OCCASION: laughing and analyzing with Ryan , Jer, Shan and cousin Cheri...APPEARANCE: dark brown, iced tea-like body; off-white,, pencil-thin moustache-like head; could not expect much more, given the alcohol content... AROMA: tight, punchy hops; pine resin and some doughy malts; a bit of a brown ale too...then subtly scotch and bourbon in its end and warmth... PALATE: full, warm and rather flat; as the glass drains, it evens out and fills pleasantly... TASTE: sour lemon and smoky warm hops; coal and port elements; some cognac too--a complex experience, with the bourbon power invading; strong and shouldering.... OVERALL: a big beer to experience, and at 12% ABV, intriguing...however, at $19.99 a four-pack, NOT worth the experience--a nuance that does not deserve its price tag...still an experience to have....","dacrza1","Aug 07, 2014"

Big IPA fan but didn't expect the barley wine quality. Beautiful red color. Very intriguing smell. As for the taste the malty base hit first. Bready, some citrus, strawberry sweet maybe. Took a while to figure this one out. The mouthfeel is what was disappointing. I would have enjoyed this much more if there was more carbonation. No way I could sense the 125 IBUs I was expecting.

Pliny, Double Jack... this one's up there. The taste meets and/or exceeds expectations. Maybe a little on the sweeter side, but if that were adjusted more to my taste she'd be getting a perfect 5. Can't be just handing those out to anyone. Still can't believe this beer doesn't score higher. Very creamy mouthfeel with a tickling carb. Awesome brew.

4.25,9,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4,"A vigorous pour got only a modest head on this dark mahogany beer. The nose is excellent, though, very heady, with a rich, complex maltiness and a flowering of grassy, citrusy hops. Flavor is big as well, with caramel, toffee malt notes, a ripe fruitiness, and, of course, high bitterness and lots of hop flavor. The malt really makes it, I think. Despite the very high strength, there's little alcoholic burn, though it's definitely a warming beer. Body is substantial without being overly heavy. Very good beer. Good sipping beer.","allengarvin","Jul 14, 2014"

The nose is perfectly indicative of the taste. Really boozy, as there's no attempt to hide the alcohol. The one thing that is hidden are the 112 IBUs, as there's just a slight touch of bitterness. Medium-heavy mouth that coats the tongue with caramel malt sweetness. If you're expecting a West Coast IPA, you won't find it here. There are plenty of those around. This malt bomb is pretty darn good, and only gets better as it warms. I'm glad I went ahead and bought the four-pack.","MartzMimic","Jun 22, 2014"

The beer smell is fruity sweet with a floral hop aroma that is overcome by the sweetness. The beer also has a teeny tiny booze smell that is easily overcome. Otherwise, it's hops and fruity sweetness. The beer taste has a strong fruity malt sweetness with a complex hop taste. The hops range from a strong pine but the combined notes come off as a strong strawberry with a hint of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The beer itself is a bit thick but still smooth. Overall, a fairly unique TIPA that deserves some attention.","HattedClassic","Jun 19, 2014"

It has a pretty good hop bite to it, but a huge underlying amount of malts there too. A bit of malt sweetness coming thru. Seems to be more of a hoppy barleywine than anything else. Very good.

Founders claim that its over 200 IBU's and I know that doesn't have to mean super hoppiness, I honestly felt this was more like a hoppy barleywine or strong ale than an IPA. It was sweet, way more sweet than I was expecting it to be. I have tried several beers lately from Founders and honestly I have not been impressed. For a national distribution from the state of Michigan Bell's has this brewery beat hands down, at least the ones I have tried. This has too much alcohol to be enjoyed alone, you drink one, its not all that tasty and then you basically have to stop for the evening unless you want to get totally intoxicated. That takes away from the enjoyment experience of beer to me. Also, this beer is ridiculously expensive like $24 for a four pack. I understand the alcohol content is part of this but I will never do it again.","humuloner22","Jun 13, 2014"

But then you take a sip and realize that this beer is basically terrible. It tastes and feels like a decent IPA at first, but quickly transitions to a subpar IPA with a few shots of vodka added. I love a good strong beer, but I don't like getting alcohol face after taking a sip! I will continue to enjoy every other Founders offering, but will surely stay away from this one in the future.","Chrisbaggz","Jun 13, 2014"

Really love the color, nice sweet malts, and the hops are great for an American version of an English barleywine. My one major gripe is with the price, 20 bucks for a 4-pack is a bit much for a beer that does't taste that much different than Bigfoot, which I think is actually noticeably more hoppy. I can imagine a barrel aged version of this would be great.","PaulyB83","Jun 12, 2014"

Taste is immediately astringent bitterness mixed with alcohol. A pungent hop flavor blend of pine and citrus make an appearance before a strong alcohol burn takes over again on the finish. A brown sugar sweetness is there to complement. Not a real pleasant drinking beer, but at the same time not bad. I feel like aging could help. Just a whole lot going on.. almost could call this a hot boozy mess. As flavorful of a beer as I've had in a while. Full bodied with lots of bitter and heat. A hop-head/booze lover's delight. Glad I got the four pack. Giving one away as a gift and the other 2 will probably be aged for a year+. I'd recommend to those who have never tried this beer.","Bonis","Jun 08, 2014"

The malt serves as a backbone to aggressive hoping, which is amazingly balanced in terms of flavor and bitterness against a 12% alcohol content. Full bodied, which is rare in an IPA. It finishes balanced as well, with hop flavor and malt as the base with a lingering bitterness and alcohol note. This is a well crafted beer, especially considering the IBUs and alcohol content, but it takes those factors to extremes.","tillmac62","Nov 11, 2013"

It's also sweet, but not really malty. I like hops, and I like malt. But this is just the worst aspects of hops and malt. Then the booze is very noticeable. This isn't as refined as I expect from Founders; it's a bit crass. I don't want to finish this.

But I learned to really appreciate it once the shock wore off. The hoppiness is not just bitter but rather complex, especially if you let it warm. And the high alcohol content is nicely masked. If this were priced reasonably, I'd buy up a bunch whenever it comes out. But at $20+/4-pack this outstanding beer is just not worth it.

I find this far more interesting than I do tasty. For such a powerful and potent beer it really does have nice complexity, although balance is out the window - as it goes from syrupy sweet to almost cloyingly bitter. And the alcohol is far from hidden. In fact, you need to drink this one on the colder side, as the alcohol rises exponentially with beer temp. I would recommend pouring half the bottle into a glass, then returning the bottle to the fridge until you finish. Bottom Line - try this for sure, at least so you can say that you did - BUT, if you are like me, you will realize that there are FAR BETTER DIPA's that are readily available and much less expensive that your $$$ are better spent on. If you want to """repeat""" this more often, and less expensively, Double Dog should somewhat fill the bill until next summer ;o)","blackcompg","Aug 24, 2013"

And malt there is, malt for days. Reminds me of double jack, if double jack had about twice the amount of heat and four times as much hop presence. This beer definitely builds as you go, and I'm not certain if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm on the fence with this one. Good, but needs a bit of work. I don't think I can categorize this like I would other triple IPA's that I've had like younger or notorious because of the huge caramel malt body which overshadows the hop action, but I like it just the same.","ZRBE","Jul 15, 2013"
3.92,0.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a rich, vibrant, dark caramel coloring with a thin, frothy, off-white head that starts as a low profile coat and settles into a ring on the surface. Aromas are robust, and very rich in caramel malts, smoky and roasted. Tropical fruit sweetness blends with a spiced and bitter hops character, giving an overall tangy, rich nose. Flavors are bold and robust. Holy shit, this one's got some body. Wow, this is a rich, smooth, thick brew in mouth. Roasted caramel backbone, with a blast of pepper and resiny hops, with a bitterness that is relentless, and builds as you drink. Pine pitch throughout, along with mango, pineapple, and grapefruit sweetness. The malt profile is profound, and continues to pack a punch with every sip. The spices build as you drink, and combined with the ABV, you are left with a nice warmth. Tangy, rich sweetness and spiced, resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer stays with you long after each sip, and it is a sipper. This beer is a beast, and leans a bit towards the malt-bomb side, but with some very clear bitterness and heat.","GarthDanielson","Jul 15, 2013"

3.76,-3.6,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Beer is heavy-bodied, substantially weighty with moderate levels of carbonation, resulting in a fairly smooth, lightly fizzy beer with strong bittering agents and quite perceptible ethanol. Ethanol is easily felt on the tongue and back of throat, as well as in the nostrils; other, equally strong beers have hidden their alcohol content much better than this. Closes quite dryly, as expected from the hops and ethanol. Ethanol burn lingers well after each sip, as does the substantial stickiness from the immense amount of malt used in the beer.","falloutsnow","Jul 07, 2013"

3.98,2.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.25,"Pours a nice, ruddy, clear mix of brown, red, and caramel. The smell is very malty, and has a nose almost like a barleywine. It has a massive alcohol hit, and it's so smooth that it invites you to pound it, even though you know it's going to kick your ass. It says it's an IPA, but there's so much malt to get it to 12% that it totally dominates the hops. You don't get a bourbon -style alcohol burn, but it lets you know that it's a high ABV beer. It there going down, and if you swallow some air along with it, that alcohol gives a reminder on the way back up. This is not a summertime IPA (unless you plan on being unconscious as your summertime hobby). The depth of flavor allows it to pair with a lot of different foods.","yankeepride","Apr 26, 2013"

A bit off booze with sweet sugary aromas. Some bread-like aromas also. Taste is...wow...I'm very hesitant to call this a triple IPA. This taste very similar to Bigfoot with a bit more booze. This definitely tastes like a barleywine. Very malty with caramel and sweet brown sugar at first. Tingly, spicy booze and hoppiness. The booze can be a little overwhelming at times. Mouthfeel is full bodied and tingly. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is not one of my favorite Founders beers. It is good in small doses, but this is not an IPA. Being from the west coast, I'm used to triple IPAs tasting like PtY, Drake's Black Label, Expo, etc. This one is much more malty and boozy. Good beer, but not great.","DovaliHops","Dec 13, 2012"

It was easily worth the $3 for a single bottle that I paid, and I would even say that it beats out DFH’s 90 Minute for my favorite DIPA, though I will have to reevaluate that when I finally give that one its long-delayed review.

I don't smell much - but here goes: citrus fruits, pine needles, and herbal notes. That's about all I get. The taste hits you hard - an assault after the subtle nose. It's like every hope variety in the world is included, and a sweet malty backbone attempts to balance it all. Bitter and sweet, but mostly bitter. Tastes of lemon, orange, grapefruit, pine resin, something almost medicinal, hot alcohols (fairly well covered under the bitterness), and caramel in the background. I'm reminded of an American Barleywine in the overall mouthfeel and taste. Top notch ale. Hence the price tag...","kingjames1","Aug 19, 2012"

The hops in here are well chosen to present a variety of flavors, and balanced slightly toward the more bitter of those flavors, but with just enough citrus left to prevent the drinker from feeling like they’re chewing on pine sap. Simultaneously, the huge sugars in here play nicely off of the hops, bursting on the tongue in sweet goodness. In fact, it’s hard to imagine more flavor being crammed into a bottle.

4.27,9.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I enjoyed this beer and was a little impressed, I thought it was a great example of intense DIPA, for being as intense as it was it was still nicely balanced. This beer had pretty good drinkability, the alcohol didn't show up as much as I thought it would, it wasn't overly bitter, and the flavor sure kept me interested and on my toes, but one is enough for me, but If i was on a mission to wreck my palate and get wasted I could see drinking two, but anymore then that just wouldn't be a good idea. What I liked most about this beer was how intense yet balanced it was, it had the best of both worlds and that worked well with this beer, the taste was the highlight. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness, it was a little too sweet at times, but that didn't hurt it that much since that comes with the territory. I would buy this beer again, but probably not till next year, at over $5 dollars it's pretty expensive, but sometimes you got to treat yourself, and a couple of these a year seems like the right amount, I recommend this beer to anyone that loves big and intense DIPA's. All in all this was a great beer, that exceeded my expectations, after hearing a little bit about this beer I was afraid it was going to be one of those too intense and overly bitter DIPA's, but once I got down to it it wasn't nearly as rough as I thought it would be and the balance really impressed me. Forget what you heard about this beer and just try it, you will be glad you did. Founders comes through with another great beer, great job guys this one's impressive and worthy of it's name, sometimes you have to dance with the devil.  2014 Edit I aged a bottle for a year and it turned into a nice barleywine, the hops died down with just a little bitterness remaining and I thought it was a good beer, I really enjoyed it aged.","StoutHunter","Aug 06, 2012"
3.91,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O- If you didn't see it coming already, I cannot shake the correlation to DD and BB. That said, this is a wonderful beer, but being that it is a seasonal, limited availability and quite pricey (I've seen it range from $5 to $7+ per bottle), I just don't think it is worth the extra money (although I could only imagine the base cost to make this beer!). I will just be thankful for being able to quaff Burton Baton year-round and at a significantly lower price. Although a tremendous fan of all things Founders brews, this will be a one-time purchase for me.","threeviews","Aug 06, 2012"

Served in a snifter, a very attractive, brazen, reddish copper color, hazy, with a neat little cap of dense white head that retained well and left a bit of lacing on the glass right until the end. Aroma is expectedly hop-dominant, piney, citrus zest/pith, caramel and bready malts in the background. Big blast of fresh hops in the taste, unctuous resin, citrus pith, with a thick and ubiquitous malt sweetness, for a nice counteraction that still leaves the hops clearly in charge. Strong, bitter aftertaste, and can be a palate-wrecker for the unprepared. Chewy and full-bodied, warm with booze. Very nice for the style, and really hit the spot for the hop-craver in me after a string of light summer beers.","Rifugium","Aug 03, 2012"

Don't get me wrong, this is super hoppy, highlighted by intense floral aromas and piney resiny flavors but it is not overtly offensive in the taste like it was last year.

I was not expecting the smell to be so dank, particularly because I just tried this for the first time 2 days ago on draft, after picking up six bottles, and was not terribly impressed (which leads me to embark on another story, for another time, about my fondness for bottle over daft in most cases). This, though, is amazing. I smell pine resin, intense malt with a dash of caramel but not much. There is citrus, most likely grapefruit, and of course sick hops. Taste out of the bottle dwarfs the draft version I had but two days ago. In general, taste here follows the nose. Dank pine resin and citrus hops galore, brilliantly hide the 12%ABV. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, with light to medium carbonation and light bitterness. Overall this is excellent. I suppose I enjoy this more than most, but then again, Founders makes my favorite beers. I should have bought more of this.","rodlavers","Jul 19, 2012"

There is a somewhat assertive bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

4.22,8.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 6/2/2011. Pours slightly hazy brick red color with a small 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Some decent lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of big mango, orange, grapefruit, pine resin, floral, caramel, and some toasted malts. Some excellent aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big orange, mango, pine, lemon zest, caramel, toasted malt, and spiciness. Big sweetness in the front that leads to a strong brutal bitterness on the finish that lasts. Lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, and spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that goes down smoothly, but is still a sipper. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 12%, the warming on the finish is barely noticeable. Great balance of flavor and bitterness. Overall, an excellent and tasty Imperial IPA from Founders.","superspak","Nov 10, 2011"

3.7,-5.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours a hazy orange with little head that has practically no retention. Smell is a powerful combination of orange and hops. The upfront taste is dominated by a fruity citrus blast followed by a tongue twisting assault of hop goodness. The sweet alcohol finish is a bit of a downer, however. I'd classify this one as a noble effort by a great brewery, but I'll take a super hoppy DIPA over this TIPA anytime.","57md","Oct 14, 2011"

On the nose, there are huge notes of grapefruit and citrus peel, along with funk, caramel, pepper, grain and a touch of pine. The flavor is moderately sweet with intensely bitter hops. Dominant notes in the flavor are citrus peel, toasty caramel malts, resin and pine. The finish is long and bitter with resiny hops. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a great triple IPA.","CuriousMonk","Oct 02, 2011"

Intense, pungent herbal hop aroma with citrus orange and grapefruit in the background. Smooth and oily feel. Flavor is all hops. Pungent, earthy herbal hop flavors that simply overwhelm your tastebuds. The first sip had a biting tanginess that seemed to numb my tongue and I never experienced that sensation again. Finished semi-dry with a noticable alcoholic heat and a lingering herbal bitter aftertaste. IPAs are DIPAs easily my favorite, but this was over the top for my thirst for hoppy beer.

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"WOW. Is all I can say about this beer it is extremely intense. As it warmed up it seemed to have more intense characteristics similar to Double Trouble.

Expensive, but not crazy expensive like it is now. Anyway, I poured it into a tulip glass. Very little head. The color is very dark and itlooks pretty thick. Phew! No quite digging the aroma! Very pungent hops smell, almost oniony. Now I know what people are talking about when they complain about Gubna (although I didn't get that smell with that). Ok, I'm taking several sips before I type my comments, because the taste is evolving a little. There's still a little of the onion here, but also some strong, (regular) hops taste. Everything about this beer is strong. I really don't remember it being this in your face.

A sip was a wave of flavor, nice citrusy hop flavor up front with a sweet body and a bunch of hoppy bitterness, but really well balanced, almost surprisingly so.

Smells like butterscotch tropical fruits citrus burnt sugar cane and some fresh ganja. Taste is crazy the bitter is there but not overwhelming it does destroy the palate though. Hard to describe but I see where people get onion and garlic but I can't say I agree. The alcohol is obvious the pine and citrus hop are there also other American hops rolled in zesty seasoning, toast, tobacco, skunk weed and fried sugar. Then you get the turnoff of earwax and cologne. the mouthfeel is soft then it sits under the tounge heavy with bitter and the unpleasant flavors fade until the next sip. Overall not overly bitter but freakin odd.","jizfiasco","Jul 23, 2011"

Big hoppy aroma of pine, weed and onions. Lots of malt, fuller side of medium bodied. Plenty of hop bitterness to round out the sweetness. Very aggressive. More of that onion flavor which I didn't particularly enjoy. Very drying finish from the hops. Way over the top, this didn't do much for me.","homebrewhawk","Jul 21, 2011"

I can’t imagine Founders expects anyone to drink more than one at a time. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy it—in some ways I did, very much—but to call it a “sipper” is an understatement; this is a commitment, a test of endurance, even a dare.

Too sweet, too thick, too rough; ever heard the saying “too much of a good thing?” That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Now, while it didn’t exactly sit well with me, it was way different than any beer I’ve ever had. This beer was all about taking chances, and that’s what Founders does best.

Unfortunately, I found the fruit notes on the palate too cloying for the earthy, resiny pineyness that should have carried the day IMO. As an excercise in brewing, Devil Dancer is incredible.

Hundreds of carbonation bubbles sit on the sides of the glass and wait their turn to race to the top. The smell is the strongest smell of hops of any beer I have ever drank. As soon as I cracked open the cap I got a rush of piney citrus through the nostril. Once I poured into a glass I could smell the hoppiness 5 feet away. I think this smell could be a turn off to some, but I love it. Whoa, this one is bitter, but I like that. I catch a floral variety of fresh hops and bitterness all alike. The alcohol is well masked for being 12% ABV. The mouthful is pretty thick and very carbonated. This beer has the most hop presence out of any beer I have ever had. The smell and the taste will explain the words hop and bitter.

It's not so much a battle of flavors as a gathering of some co-operative organization without a plan for action or a leader. Whose turn is it this week? Oh, mine?

Throughout, there was a delicious tang in the back of my mouth. The bitter hoppiness built as I drank more. My glass was nice and thick in my mouth but lacked carbonation.

Heavy, alcoholic malts. Taste? Heavy, alcoholic malts. Very bitter. It may sound like I'm beating down on this beer, but sipping this like a port wine makes this much more enjoyable. Yeah, maybe I could sit for a few more minutes to sip and sniff this beer, but guessing ingredients would be a dart throw, and I never win cricket.

Slightly syrupy, sticky and oily and the warmth of the alcohol is definitely present, but it's disguided really well for a 12% brew. It's about as drinkable as a beer this big can be.

The head only comes to about a finger in height (off white), but sits there for an impressive amount of time before slowly fading. Lack of lacking is the only real letdown as far as looks go. The nose is a huge blast of caramel and resiny, piny hop goodness, fantastic. Each sip brings exactly what the nose promised, along with a monstrous (but given the prevailing sweetness, not overbearing) hop bite, and slight (but not entirely unpleasant) alcohol burn. Devil Dancer tastes like Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA's little brother, and that's meant to be a compliment. The body is thick, nice and syrupy, which is all one can expect from an IPA this big. Carbonation is on the low end, which works for this style. I'm impressed, for a beer this big and packing this much flavor Devil Dancer drinks pretty damn easily. The alcohol, while present, doesn't become a hindrance. Bravo to Founders for crafting a (triple) IPA that approaches crossing the line into being over the top without doing so.

Couple fingers of offwhite head, and massive, thick and chunky lace. Minimal retention. Aroma is grapefruit, pine and oranges, alcohol peaks through a touch also. Hops are huge here, some dark breadiness as well. Alcohol becomes more prominent with warmth. Malt hits immediately, slick and sweet, very caramel-like. Fruits are hot on its tail, and a wave of alcohol arrives. Seeing as this has been sitting around for quite a bit, it feels as if this almost approached barleywine territory here. Malt is quite sweet here too, and although I heard some people claim that this takes away quite a bit from the beer, I have no problem with this. Many have also claimed that this is an absolute palate wrecker, and although I agree to a degree, I've had suffered more at the hands of other beers (this however may be a function of the bottling date). Does some substantial damage as well. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and sticky, with medium carbonation, and surprisingly reasonable drinkability given the 12% ABV.

The taste isn't much of a change of pace, though here the piny notes really start to assert themselves on the back end. The caramel doesn't go without a fight, though.

Drives into your nose like a pick, even the ample honey, caramel and pine sap can't lessen the brunt of the highly herbaceous hoppiness and sour white to pink grapefruit, close to having a salty saline quality, the pineapple, nectarine, mango, papaya, kiwi fruit scents leaden and gluey, leaves you suspecting that there's more complexity under the massive density but you're not getting much of it. Full-bodied is putting it """lightly," hard to imagine an IPA more densely packed, little sense of movement, impressive if tiring. Pink grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange all juicy if not quite vivid. The nectarine, guava, mango, pineapple, apricot fruit steamrolled by the bitterness of the hops, so hard to focus on anything but those hops.

The aroma was comprised of subtle malt and BIG hop notes. The flavor was of subtle malt with a MASSIVE hop bitterness/bite while not being overwhelming. It was heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this on tap goes down MUCH smoother than out of the bottle (see my previous review). Everyone owes it to themselves to see what I mean by this. The appearance is very nice, the aroma is a bit lacking however, but it's a massive 'triple' IPA so of course the hops dominate. The big hop bitterness punishes your palate but still manages to go down smoothly oddly enough.","thagr81us","Jul 30, 2010"

More pronounced sweet fruity flavors, like guava juice with syrup added in, akin to a barleywine. I like the flavor better aged, so I notched up the rating to reflect my appreciation of this triple IPA.","CHickman","Jul 29, 2010"

The taste is a fantastic balance of sweet malty Founder goodness, thick, creamy, biscuit with lots of hops, its bitter, really bitter, lots of clean pine backed by citrus and followed by more piney citrus goodness. The mouth-feel is nice. I am really starting to love the hop resin as it takes over my mouth and makes my palate feel as if hops had seeped up into my flesh. The malt backbone is thick enough and creamy enough to hold onto all the hoppy goodness. The carbonation is 4 to a 3.75 out of 10, kinda minimal but it serves this big beer well. The drinkability of this beer is present, I believe I could drink this beer all night long, I however prefer to savor beers that are hop over-kill with small sips through out the night.","nas5755","Jul 27, 2010"

The hops give a big dose of citrus and tropical fruit aromas. There is a lot of alcohol as well giving this beer a rum-like charactor. What can I say about the flavor. One sip and my palate was shredded. The bitterness is extreme and lasts in the aftertaste forever. Combined with the huge alcohol flavor, makes this one tough beer to drink. The hop flavors are lost which is unfortunate. The body does its best to carry the IBUs and alcohol and there is a nice soft carbonation. Good texture. This beer in my opinion is hardly drinkable.

Taste is sweet malt at the front, slight hops in the middle and a nice bitter finish that lingers on for quite some time. To me this drinks more like a barleywine than an Imperial IPA, which when aged is expected but this is a fresh bottle. The mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky, feels good, real good.

There is an intense bitter character which adds some light chalky and asprin notes. The hops are supported by a fairly heavy caramel malt which adds a good amount of sweetness. This is a big ol bucket of hop juice, the profile really hits all across the board. The feel is somewhat thick, sticky, and slick. There is some tingly carbonation to help cut through the malt. The brew starts off sweet and end quite bitter. There is some noticable ABV burn that pops through here and there. A ridiculously hoppy beer but it works. The aroma is fantastic.

Like all triple IPAs, it is malty and sweet to be sure, but has such great hop flavor. All those hops also, no doubt, help to tame some of the sweetness. The hop character is predominantly grapefruity with some pine and tropical fruit notes. Alcoholic bite is there, but well incorporated.

Maybe that's why it's called """Devil Dancer," because when you start your dance with it, it's wonderful, but then you realize how much of that dance you have left, and then it's grueling.

Some big piney hops that slips into sugar cane sweetness. Some alcohol punches through too. Taste is very sweet up front but quickly turns to alcohol burn. This one is a prime canidate for barrel aging which would certainly help smooth out the alcohol. Unfortunately this one just becomes overbearing. Finishes bone dry.

Heavy, hoppy flavor...very dark, bitter, and dangerous. Dark, sweet malt underlies everything, but the sugar-encrusted oranges, rind, and a piney bitterness overtakes all. Just sinister, dank, pungent hop resin. I'm definitely drinking this one a little too fast; which isn't to say it's exactly an """easy drinker""". The mouthfeel is a creamy smooth, yet abrasively bitter experience, warming the throat on the way down. Love the aftertaste. This is a dark and delicious buzz in a bottle.

Resiny hops bring a range of smells from cedar, plum, fresh pine, cut grass and earth. Any malt aroma is lost in the jungle of hops. This is one big and boozy beer. Floral flavoring hops make up most the taste. Bitterness is there, but not as intense as I hoped. Hard to believe this is 112 IBUs. Very intense, warming alcoholic character. Syrupy going down the hatch, and leaves a biting, dry bitterness with every sip.

A surprising sweet taste at the front, which does not last long, the hops soon begin their assault. An immense grapefruit and other citrus flavors slam into the palate, lingering for some time and blending to an earthy flavor. It all finishes with a grassy and tobacco flavors at the end. A heavy medium bodied feel, with some tingling from carbonation, it leaves the palate an arid dry feel from the middle to the back of the palate. This beer is intense, to say the least, the incredible aroma and deep color are inviting, then you add the intensity of the flavor and the dryness of the feel, WOW.

It's fruity with hints of pineapple and citrus alongside piney, grassy notes. It finishes sweet, with toasty malt and hints of caramel.

Tastes are full-flavored - alcohol is very present at first, but sits back and lets the complexity of the ale take over - huge up-front grapefruit, orange and a hint of lemon initially. Sweet malts counter the bitterness better than expected, but the hop bitterness still rides out the finish with tons of pine and alcohol. Leaves a tingle (maybe a bruise) on the tongue with a nice white-peppery hop bite to finish. Mouth-feel is thick like syrup, chewy, but very smooth and oily from the hop resins. Overall, unbelievable quality here, especially when working with 112 ibu's.

Massively hoppy with notes of pineapple, lime and mango as well as a nice caramel sweetness that balances out the bitterness. The finish is sweet but not cloying.

It smells like citrusy hops, caramel and toasted malt, and a bit of piney hops. The taste is very good, with great balance between the hops and malt. I can taste citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine hops, brown sugar, caramel malt, and some tropical fruit. There's also a nice lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink.

The beer is a clear, dark ruby with low carbonation and a half-inch, dark khaki head that leaves a few wisps of lacing. Toasty and bready malts in the nose, along with floral alcohol, crystal malts and some citric/resiny hops, but I was expecting more hop aroma. On the palate, there are pungent hops that impart grapefruit, orange, and notes of pepper. Sweet crystal malts and an intense bitterness strike a surprising balance, starting sweet, then moving to a long and bitter finish. Thick and almost syrupy, fairly dry, with coating hop oils that linger forever. This is much bigger than I thought it would be, and I'm kinda getting what they mean by triple IPA - it's much maltier than a double IPA and much hoppier than a barleywine.

Flavor is more of an explosion of dark, ripe fruits bombarding the pallete with raisins, plums, cherries, very reminiscient of a good barleywine, with a strong bitter hop finish taking over the palette in the end that holds on for dear life, alongside a deeply alcohol warming effect down the gullet. Mouthfeel is extremely heavy and syrupy, light carbonation, and semi-dry, bitter finish. I tend to think that this beer is a bit too extreme, and that is its downfall.

Not a tongue ripping TRIPA, but an incredibly smooth and easy drinking beer. Dangerously, there is absolutely, positively, no sign of the 13% alcohol that it states on the label. This beer runs down your throat and begs for another trip before you've even put the glass down. If you have multiple bottles in the fridge, this has potential to be a real shit-kicking night ender. Due to the incredible amount of malt that has been placed in this beer, I have to say that I think this would be great even after it ages for a while and the hops die down.

A faint citrus hop twinge pops up toward the back of the tongue and finishes quite bitter w/ a touch of melon. Tastes similar to some Dogfish efforts, but the balance seems a bit lopsided here - not sure if its that the hops aren't super fresh or if the malt sweetness and alcohol are just overkill. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, very resinous and coating, but not too viscous. The hot/bitter end helps cleanse the palate even though its still fully coated. Leaves off nice and warm, sorta apropos of the name. A bit devilish I suppose.

On the palate, noticeable sweetness to begin, complex caramel malt tones, I did not think the hops overdone here oddly enough, stretching out to a lingering drier espresso bitter finish. It was redolent of an aged oloroso sherry or Madeira and almost the same alcohol level. Also thought it a bit like a darker, maltier Brown Shugga with more depth.

The beer pours a ruby brown, with a sticky and syrupy consistency, minimal lacing, no head, no retention. The smell is the best part and outstanding in its own right. The aroma is intense brown sugars, caramel, liqueur, thick syrupy malts, and heavy fruits of the fig and raisin variety. The taste is just overpowered by the alcohol, but underneath it all you will find a pretty hopped up beer, and intense brown sugar malts, caramels, and liqueur ... lots of it.

I actually thought that I had a flat beer with the carbonation was present in the mouthfeel. I poured it rather aggressively and all I could get was a handful of small white bubbles. Smell is huge. There is a huge hop bouquet with sweet malts following quickly. Also notes of raisins and chocolate. The taste of the beer is hops. It's just huge. Probably one of the hopiest beers I have ever had. It is also one of the most acidic beers I have ever drank also. It's hard to drink because of its acidity. Mouthfeel is good. More like a barleywine then a DIPA. It's really had to drink. If the acidity would be turned down then the beer would be much easier to drink.","hwwty4","Mar 30, 2008"

The nose on this beer is about as complex as you will find in a beer. I think this smells more like a barleywine than an IIPA. The heaviest scents include the very rich maltiness with heavy tropical fruit, resinous pine, and sweet caramel. There is also a cognac like booze smell coming from this beer. Each time I put my nose into it I get something new! The nose is really well done on this one. The flavor profile is equally as intense. For an IIPA the taste is more malt based on this beer. The malt is the heavy hitter here with flavors of caramel and brown sugar and rum soaked raisins. The hop profile comes in after a few seconds but plays second to the malt profile. The hop profile tastes of fresh grapefruit rind and sticky pine. There is some sharp alcohol flavor as well, but in no ways takes away from this beer but adds another unique quality to this beer. This beer will challenge your palate. I don't think this beer crosses the """boozy""" line on the mouthfeel, but I personally don't mind the alcohol on the mouthfeel. This beer is full-bodied and has a velvety texture. I will stop praising this beer when it comes to drinkability though. At 13% you wouldn't last very long with many of these.

I just had a fresh bottle again tonight (which I just picked up in Chicago), and I was still disappointed. In contrast, I also just had DD on tap at the Maproom in Chicago and thought it was incredible. The tap version is quite malty, but with a strong blast of fresh hop aroma and hop flavor along with a sizable bitterness. I would call it a """clean, hoppy, malty, American barleywine""" instead of some sort of IPA, but whatever you call it...it was fantastic. In fact, I liked it so much, I had a second snifter of it. On the other hand, the bottled version seems to have a fairly complex fruity/malty flavor along with an adequate bitterness, but the hop flavor and aroma are severely lacking compared to the tap version. The bottled version also has a strong dirtiness to it as well which wasn't in the tap version. The bottled version (even though it was fresh) tastes very much like it's been aged for many months. It appears that Founders is one of many breweries where the bottled beers taste significantly different/inferior to the tap versions. I like the Founders beers I've had quite a lot, but to taste them at their best, it seems you need to have them on tap. My review of DD is based on the superior tap version.","ohmybock","Mar 06, 2008"

For such a hop bomb, there is significant malty sweetness which I find balances out this fairly well. Aftertaste drys the mouth a bit, but not too much. Mouthfeel is very syrupy and thick with hardly any carbonation at all. This is a beast, sip and enjoy.","BeerTruth","Jun 27, 2007"

It also seemed more like a barley wine than a """Triple IPA""" unless the difference between double and triple IPA means that there's a lot less hops and lot more sweetness and alcohol.

Almost no head formed except for a small coating atop the beer, therefore leaving no lace. Smell was almost intoxicating. Major hops, a little sweet maltiness in the background, spices, a generous amount of alcohol. I enjoyed the flavor a bit more than the aroma. Very aggressive hops bomb your taste buds, sweet malt. Somewhat peppery and spicy. Alcohol isn't overwhelming. Finishes somewhat citrusy with a ton more hops. Is actually somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, with no carbonation.

The aroma is big citrusy hops, sweet orange and some grapefruit. Taste is just a big hop punch, tons of citrus, with the malty sweetness mostly hidden but still somewhat apparent. The alcohol is present but amazingly diguised for 13%. A little carbonation would be nice, but I think that being just slightly effervescent works for a beer of this strength.

Pours a nice amber-orange color with a nice frothy head. Nose is strong on hops, floral and fruity (especially grapefruit sourness). Taste is on the edge for me. It's incredibly strong on the bitter hops, and those hit you up front - potentially a little too hard, in my head. The whole beer through it went back and forth from being too hoppy to just right for me, which is strange. That excessive hoppiness just seemed astringent, sour in the mouth. When it was good, it was tasty, but it just didn't seem consistent enough. Feel was solid, full body, good carbonation. I honestly couldn't finish this whole one; had a friend help me out with it, mostly because the hoppiness was so huge and full that it was just a little too much for me.

Overall smell was very nice, not over powering, but did have enough to tingle the nose a bit. Taste was very crisp, clean, and warming. Alcohol was a big factor in the beginning again, with a huge pine hop hit. Letting it warm brings out the malt that was trying to balance it with a bit of sweetness, but is still overpowered by the hops. This was a very good brew, and I am glad I got to try it.

Anyhow, it poured a nice light strawberry red color, but really no head at all, which was sort of a bummer, but the color made up for it. Aroma was full of floral hops...very much on the grapefruit and tangerine side. It was bursting with fruity smells and some sweet hop aromas as well. Taste was just as fruity, perhaps even more so. The hops show up towards the end, leaving behind a pleasant bitterness. Mouthfeel was oily and slick, just the way I like my heavy beers. Mouthfeel was the biggest surprise. When I first sipped I thought it would probably be around the 9-10 percent alcohol region, but when I saw the 13% I was floored. The alcohol is completely hidden with this beer.

Slightly medicinal, but not too overly. Toasted, sharp bitterness up front. Moves quickly to sugary sweet and fruit concentrate. Not cloying, however, due to surges of massive hop oil bitterness.

Heavy aromas of orange rind, toasted malt, and some spicy alcohol heat as well as caramel tones. Thick body that is filled with estery alcohol and a musty, funked orange rind; a bit like when you buy a bag or oranges and inevitably come to find the one in the bottom that has some moldy skin. The alcohol is warm to hot all the way through and heats the tongue, the throat, and on down into the stomach. There is a spicy, resinous mixed orange rind and caramel flavor in the finish. Thick and syrupy body, no carbonation, yet not overly sticky with hops. As it warms, it gets even thicker and the alcohol becomes more pronounced. Definitely more of a barleywine now.

Taste is no suprise, larger than life complex hops and malted just as heavily supports this beer very nicely. Great balancing between the two, sweet caramel malts are undeniable. There is a defining heat about this beer between the big abv and the extreme hopping this brew has undergone, hits on all cylinders and forces you to take notice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous, low carbonation, finish is comprised of hop oils and caramel with a slight dryness from the heat of the alcohol.

The malt flavors give way to the hop attack very quickly. Loads of piney, citrusy and hop flavors attack the tastebuds. Raw hop flavors. Raw hop flavors. Low carbonation gives this a good mouthfeel. For being 13% ABV, this is dangerously drinkable. Take heed! A solid beer, seems to border on an American Barleywine, but who really cares what """style""" this fits into.

4.52,15.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Being from Grand Rapids, I've always loved Founder's. I've always seen devil dancer on the shelves and had a curiosity, but was afraid of the """Triple IPA 13% abv""" on the label. I've recently developed a taste for IPAs, and I love big beers. After trying the carmudgeon, I figured I could handle this. Beer is served well below room temp, before you get angry I want to note its 95 here right now. I'm using a tulip glass. Not too much carbonation with the pour, and only a thin line of lacing around the rim of the glass. Has a deep crimson color, not what I expected when I pored it, then again this is my first 3IPA. Smell is dry, hoppy, and malty all at once. It kind of reminds me of a belgian ale. This is a very strong tasting beer, but I feel it is well balanced. The flavor starts out with a sweet malty kick, moves to that crisp hoppy taste that all of founder's brews are trademarked by (if you've had enough founder's you may know what I'm talking about) and finishes off with a smooth dry taste. This beer is not all that refreshing, but it is very tasty. I think it would be better as a winter release. For how flavorful it is, it is suprisingly smooth and drinkable. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, very similar mouthfeel the Red's Rye (a favorite of mine). Drinkablity is kind of on the low side, I don't think I could drink anything that weighs in at 13 abv for the whole night. I could see myself buying this again though. If you want to be adventurous, I say go ahead. If you want something refreshing, go with the centennial of the PA. Overall I think it is a good brew, I don't know the style so I can't compare it to other 3IPAs, but I can definitely say that it is a quality brew.","Avagadro","Jun 16, 2006"

Flavor wise super sweet malt base with a burning alcohol sensation on the palate, really pretty much kills with hop bitterness think hop liquor. Is it good, not really it's abrasive but do I enjoy how extreme this experience is, somewhat it's almost a sadistic form of abuse to really sit and drink this 12 ounce bottle.

Very harsh mouthfeel alcohol is upfront with a cloying residual sugar sweetness and the most oily hop experience I've ever had, that's where this beer really loses track of what any or extreme beer drinkers want. A beer tha is crazy big but still easy to drink, this beer is burdensome in it's truest since it's like a beer willing to push the envelope on what beer is. My local store sold out in 3 days I picked up the last four pack because I'm crazy into beer, it was around 22 bucks for a four pack, why? B/C demand drives prices and evidently if you make limited quantities of something like this you can yield very high prices even if it isn't the best product out there.","WVbeergeek","Feb 15, 2006"

Also, there sneaks in some caramel malt notes. The beer is smooth across the tongue with lots of malt viscosity. Then the hops kick in, grassy and fresh hay like green meadows, then moving to darker, woodsy pine hops that stick to your gums and teeth. The hops stick around well after the beer is down the gullet leaving a resinous and dry tart feeling in th emouth. This beer is big, and packs a wallop.

This has quite a thick, syrup-like palate to it; it sticks to your mouth even after you have swallowed it, and for some reason it is not all that pleasant. The malt also plays a heavy hand in this beer, it is not just all hops; there is a concentrated unfermented beer taste to it (very similar to malt extract), with lots of notes of caramel, & toasted malt.

Tons and tons of grapefruit rind but balanced by a definitive malty sweetness that takes the form of dates. The taste has a mild sweetness up front, and then waves of hop bitterness.

Caramel malt provides a balance to all the hops and alcohol aromas. Thick and malty to start, bitterness creeps in and grows through the finish, becoming quite strong yet short of aggressive. Orange citrus flavour and intense caramel sweetness hits part way through and transitions into a bit of pine as well as alcohol taste and warmth. A bit vinous, mainly due to alcohol flavour. Strong pine resin lingers in the finish, and this is the only point where the hops in this beer become just a little bit harsh. It has a full body with plenty of residual sweetness, but the attenuation was sufficient to keep it from feeling sticky. Moderate to low carbonation that's well integrated as fine bubbles, and a viscous, creamy texture. This is definitely a sipping beer, but still easily drinkable for the amount of malt, hops, and alcohol present. It also seems to get better as it warms.

Cheap scotch reminiscent alcohol nature, very hot citric hops, earthy, caramelic and apricot like. Hot and abrasive palate, like a Chinook hop shot. Highly astringent, but who cares, its flavourful eh? Woody, minty. Ni drinkability which I expect to have a minimum of in a pale ale. Medium-thick bodied, syrupy. Purposeless heavyweight lost child.

Flavor literally seems to run around the mouth, hitting all the tastebuds quickly with their potent hops pedigree. Still, the malt character does keep the bitterness somewhat in check, allowing hops flavor to stand somewhat on its own. Alcohol is more felt through warming than tasted.

Taste is hoppy as all hell as well. Grassy, herbal, raw, leafy, acidic, dry, citrusy, oily, etc. The malts do become apparant though in the somewhere caramel sweet, doughy middle. However that does not last long and the hops come back in a big away for the incredibly hoppy, and tongue scrapingly bitter/dry finish that lasts and leaves you with an incredibly scarred palate and amazingly poten hop burps. Mouthfeel is syrupy thick, and lend another degree of complexity to this already quite complex """chewy, chewin' on a hop brew"""! Drinkability is touch to mark. I've had this 3 times or so in smaller 6oz or so samples. Whilst i'd never pass up a chance to drink a bit of this nectar, I don't think i'd want to do a whole 12oz bottle for myself. I'll score it at a 4 since i'd like to drink this one often, but in small doses. If this came in a magnum it would be deadly!","francisweizen","Jul 19, 2005"

Huge hop flavor-not only is it extremely floral but a huge bitterness behind it all. Big caramel flavor and a somewhat alcohol finish. Not hot but its definately there. Very good body-fairly well balanced considering the high abv. Dangerously drinkable. More like a barleywine then a Double IPA to me.

4.58,17.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"After being freed from its incarceration inside this 12oz bottle, it fills my glass a wonderful deep crimson / dark copper color with a light almost khaki head. The dark color of this brew is quite enticing. Great head retention, and some good patchy lacing on the glass. Nice powerful aroma of hops - clean, floral, pungent, and spicy all at the same time. Also some caramel and a fair dose of alcohol in the nose. After a taste, the name Devil Dancer sure seems appropriate. Hops hit you like a .44 magnum. Hop oils are so potent they are spicy and almost salty. A little citrous and some noticeable pine have also showed up to beat up on your taste buds. Very sweet malts and some caramel keep the hops in check, however. In fact, the malts are a little too bold for the IPA style. Warming alcohol permeates the taste, reminding you how potent this devil of a brew really is. Finish is oily hop bitterness with a good amount of malt sweetness, and the 13% abv flexing its muscles. By far the biggest mouthfeel of any IPA I've ever had - no wonder Founders calls it a triple IPA! This outstanding mouthfeel must be experienced to be believed - it seriously beats some imperial stouts that I have had.","BeerFink","Apr 12, 2005"

This is the kind of beer that can make it difficult to enjoy a light bodied beer once you have immersed your senses in its wonder. Hopped caramel cream and some warmth tickle the taster. Nice bitters. Just enough sweetness to maintain some semblance of sanity with this rich, strong character. This one progresses into an even tastier glass as it warms. Beauty and power defined.

The choice of label art was interesting, to say the least, and so was the style moniker of Triple IPA. The beer poured barley wine like deep red amber, with a thick syrupy, dense body that was topped by an average sized beige head that left a good curtain of lace. The smell was citric hoppy reminding me of grapefruit rinds, and had roasty sweet malts lurking just behind the blanket. The beer was leaning definitely on the hoppy side with a zesty peppery taste of burning hop oils. The caramel and pale malts were not quite subdued with the boisterous hoppyness and provided a nicely sweet backbone. The mouthfeel was slick and was followed by a soft buttery-sweet aftertaste.

Let's just say the hops hit you like a punch in the face from a heavyweight boxer. They are there in such force, that it takes you a second to get your bearings. However, the swallow is remarkably smooth and easy considering the hop barrage and high ABV. I honestly don't think a beer could be hoppier than this. As much as I enjoyed this one tastewise, it does take a bit to get used to it. One in a session.

There's a hint of grapefruit/ citruis from Cascade/Centennial here, but there's also the earthiness from Fuggles, I'm guessing, and some floral hits as well. The problem I have is that it's not well put together. It's just a bunch of hops thrown together. Mouthfeel is thick and lush.

It's a fairly pronounced smell. The taste is superb, with lots of maltiness up front that is fairly sweet. Don't look for it to stay long though, as the hops come rushing over the tongue, covering it in alpha acid goodness. The bitterness is not overpowering at all, and there is NO trace of alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkabiliy couldn't get any better for a 13% brew.

Very little lacing. The aroma is peppery, with hops, citrus and a babys breath of malt. Very rich-bodied. I like to drink even the hoppiest IPA normally but this is definitely a sipper.

To put this beer in the category of what Vinnie Cilurzo and other West Coast brewers began would be a grave mistake. Of course there is a range of creation within every """style""" of beer, but this beer falls way far from the pale. No matter how much hop material you put in a boiling wort, there is an upper limit of oils and acids that can be dissolved. Furthermore, with a gravity so high to create 13% alcohol, and then to leave judicious residual sweetness in the final product, the supposed 200 IBU's are lost or better yet out battled by the equal amounts of Caramel malts.

5,28.2,5,5,5,5,5,"This review is from a 12oz bottle sampled on 12-18-04. Pours out a bright reddish amber with about half an inch of light tan head that slowly forms. This leaves some rings of lace around the glass and has fairly decent retention for a 13% monster brew. Aroma starts out with a bit of sweet malt before the huge hops take over. Citric and earthy hops galore leave notes of grapefruit, pine, grass and other yummy hops smells. As it warms some alcohol sneaks into the aroma reminding me of a heavily hopped barley wine. A good amount of caramel malt sweetness starts off the flavor before giving way to a strong citric hop presence. Notes of alcohol are small but there and add greatly to the taste. This really seems like a super hoppy barley wine to me, like a double IPA crossed with an American Barley wine. It finished up on a hoppy and slightly warming note. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a warming feel to it. This is remarkably drinkable to me for the strength, but considering this seems to meld 2 of my favorite style its not a big surprise. The 13% is hidden quite well and only shows up to add to the experience. Awesome all around beer if you like big beers, Founders did another great job here.

All hops. Surprisingly, this one has a great caramelt malt in the flavor. The hops take main stage here. Grapefruit, pine, etc comprise most of the flavor.

It is good, but so hopped up that it is actually kind of hard to drink, it is literally so bitter it is searing, and you can feel a burning in your throat as it goes down. A very big beer, warming, but with a bit too much alchohol tang. The hops oil it up, it feels almost slimy as you drink it, you feel it in your throat and on your lips. It is good, but certainly not a session beer, even if you can afford the heavy duty price tag. I am a hop head, and was excited to get a chance to try it, but this one needs some time alone in a dark closet, to see if a little time with meld it into an upper echelon double (or triple?)

Lots of brilliant citrus hop, but with a rich caramel malty backbone that supports the hop very well. For such a strong set of flavors, it is really very nice. The fell is very thick, and rather warming after swallowing it. For 13%, this beer is highly drinkabile. Everything is balanced in the flavor, and the alcohol does not get in the way of any part of it. This is a very nice contrast to the breakfast stout.

Also a winterfresh, which may be the alcohol (13%) mixing with some spicey hop. Thick mouthfeel. ALCOHOL, then hop bitter, and a mild caramel sweet. Some citrus, but not as strong as I was expecting.

The taste wasn't the overly bitter, out of whack hoppiness I was half expecting considering the name. This beer simply amazed me! First it was very creamy which is odd for a 10% beer. Second it was quite thick and syruppy. Lastly it was extremely smooth and easy to drink (way too easy to drink). The balance was remarkable. Lots of sweet, syruppy maple and caramel at first but then the hoppiness kicks in. More flavor from the hops than bitterness but it was still bitter. This wasn't the most complex beer I have had but that might have been because of the coldness of the beer and the fact I drank it too fast to let it warm. This was liquid candy for any hop head or malt head or anybody who appreciates good beer. The best DIPA I have had to date!","granger10","Jul 04, 2004"
