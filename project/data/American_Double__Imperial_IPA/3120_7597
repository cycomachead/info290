4.24,-3.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"on draft in Alpine restaurant. Super west coast IPA, could drink it all the time but incredibly it was my 4th Favorite beer of the day! Just a great beer, just not as good as Nelson or Duet...","KATCanada","Thursday at 06:36 PM"
4.31,-1.6,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Another good beer from Alpine. Pours radiant copper, semi-transparent, a finger of foam and decent retention. I'm getting a lot of fresh-cut grass and pine needles in the nose. A bit of grapefruit that feels like it was sprinkled with my grandpa's sugar. The taste is pretty much the same with piney notes taking center stage. I get a big wave of grapefruit on the finish, intermingled with a touch of lemon. Ample doses of bitterness, which is always good. Finishes a bit dry, and leaves that tongue smacking effect I enjoy so much. Glad to have tried this one. Don't pass if you get the hopportunity. Larrrrrrrge.","weiserr","Tuesday at 10:27 AM"

Taste is full of grapefruit and pine. Floral and tropical flavors in the back. Nice malt backbone. Some spiciness as well some dankness and sweet onion. Mouthfeel is vey crisp and light.

The malts though, while they blend very well into the dankness, play nothing but a supportive role, handling the fruity, bitter hop madness. Also invites a honeyed fruit note to the palate, containing kiwi, unripe orange and water melon, which perform outstandingly well together with the grassy pine. Finishes slighty dry, outstandingly bitter, with lots of dank citrus and water melon, punchlined by a floral honey note. Awesome beer, incredibly full of subtle hop flavors, while drinking extremely smooth and easy, with a unique, full taste. Blown away.","aleigator","Feb 22, 2015"

Despite the name, it isnt an over the top hop bomb, it comes off more balanced and brilliantly executed... It is missing a certain element that the very best IIPAs have (Heady and Hop Zombie come to mind) that prevents this from being a 5.

The taste is more of the same. Lots of juicy tropical fruit flavors. Mango and guava upfront with some pine as well. Resinous towards the finish with more piney hop bitterness. Oily mouthfeel. Somewhat noticeable alcohol presence but it drinks very easily. This one is a great mix of pine and tropical fruit flavors along with a solid amount of bitterness. More dank hop flavor comes out as it warms. Overall, outstanding Imperial that I would love to get a chance to drink again.","PicoPapa","Mar 29, 2014"

4.46,1.8,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a clear, amber color with thick white foam. The smell was a strong and persistent fruity-chewy hop aroma with some malt backing it up. The taste was naturally dominated by the chewy, resinous hops, but the hops were not really over the top and were nicely balanced with the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly sweet with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The dry, hoppy flavor lingered on the tongue pleasantly.","jbaker67","Feb 02, 2014"

The first thing that hit my nose was pine, quickly followed by various citrus notes. The variety of hops used in this beer is quite evident. The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied beer, there is some malt flavors in the background but they are light. The beer is a very well done DIPA that drinks very easily.

They are all fantastic but I feel there are clear winners amongst them. This one probably has the most hop complexity but the pine and resin dominates the most I think. Aroma isn't as bright and strong as the other two either, despite being an overall stronger beer. For all I know this could have been an older bottle, but who knows because they don't date. Regardless, wonderful brew from a fantastic brewery.","Dope","Sep 18, 2013"

My only complaint, which isn't even legitimate, is that it's not as remarkably fantastic/memorable as the two other Alpine beers I have reviewed (Duet and Nelson). This is a great DIPA, but the bar for this style has been set absurdly high. That being said, this is definitely in my top 10 DIPAs ever.","angrybabboon","Aug 03, 2013"

Sweet malt hits the palate first, followed by earthy, citrusy hops. Soapy and astringent finish (and aftertaste). Medium body with light carbonation. Overall, a decent imperial IPA, balanced and well crafted but the astringent finish and soapy aftertaste diminish its drinkability.","JohnG190","Jul 10, 2013"

I am curious as to how fresh this bottle is, because from start to finish it comes off as stale. Yet another reason for breweries to bottle date their IPAs/DIPAs! I'm glad I got to try it, but next time I seek out Alpine it will be for one of their many other strong offerings. Of the three Alpine brews Ive had in the last week Id rank them as follows: Duet -> Nelson-> Pure Hoppiness.","zac16125","Dec 20, 2012"

The only gripes I have is that it's not complex and I really feel Alpine can really do a better job in their presentation. Still great balance and presence.

4.22,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"deep amber body with a finger and a half of thick white creamy head. glass looks like lace curtains when the beer is gone. floral hops and a nice citrus presence are detected by my super sleuth nose. pure hoppy goodness is detected by my taste buds! man is this good, wish i would of done a side by side with pliny! nice crisp juicy fresh fruits in the flavor of this. my only knock about this is that there appears to be too much sugar residule hidden in the back somewhere. not enough to take away from the awesomeness of this beer, just enough to detect, but then again after having a super fresh pliny everything lacks a little. full resiny body with spot on carbonation and a not too bitter or dry finish add to the drinkability.","match1112","Sep 19, 2012"

Flavor follows the nose - the balance is really excellent. It's a little sweet and a little citrusy with bread malt and a great bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a great DIPA, one of the best year-round beers of the style. If this was sold around me, I'd drink it all the time.","starrdogg","May 11, 2012"
4.59,4.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance is very clear for a DIPA. Kind of a copper amber color. The nose on this beer is one of my favorites to date. A bit delicate. You get the pine, some citrus, floral and sweet notes, I almost get like a hint of cotton candy. The taste is very well balanced and extremely drinkable, clean and crisp for the style. Very little malt detected, alcohol well hidden and nice hop profile and bitterness throughout. A nice crisp hoppy finish as well. Mouthfeel is solid although possibly the most carbonated DIPA I have tried. I like carbonation but perhaps a bit high for the style. Overall a very solid DIPA. I haven't had the good fortune to try Alpine's others to get a comparison but a wonderful beer from an amazing West Coast brewery.","durrrr","May 10, 2012"

Taste is pretty hop forward, but honestly a lot smoother than I expected. Very balanced. I dont know the age on this bottle but if I had to guess then I would say thats its not as fresh as one would like. The hops die off in the flavor rather quickly and the malts come through. Still very tasty but I wish that I could have it freesh. Mouthfeel is pretty nice as well, very smooth, you can tell it has carbonation, but its almost like the thick resinous hops just eat it up. Very good, but Id really like to try it fresh.","Paulydeets","Apr 17, 2012"

Tons of piney, herby, resiny hops on the nose. Intense. Some citrus as first but soon changes to a caramel and bread aroma. Complex stuff. Smack-you-in-your-face hop bite right up front, but a really well-balanced DIPA by the maltiness on the taste. 8% alcohol, completely hidden. Another home-run by Alpine. These guys know how to make hoppy beers.","kdmcguire10","Apr 05, 2012"
4.15,-5.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Bright, bright orange, really reminds me of Pliny, just a brilliant clear orange. A strong pour gives 1 finger of white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is stongly hoppy as is to be expected. Pine resin, grapefruit peel, oranges with a decent caramel undertone. The taste was less than I was expecting given the nose. I think the "double" IPA-ness, increasing the malt and alcohol has served to mute the hops ever so slightly on the palate. It is very balanced and very drinkable, but not quite as hop-forward as I was expecting from the aroma. The mouthfeel is very good, I had absolutely no problem finishing all 22oz myself. Overall another great (D)IPA from Alpine, I wouldn't rank it at the top of their offerings but even their lesser offerings are far better than many of the best that other breweries have to offer.","quirkzoo","Apr 05, 2012"

4.61,5.3,3,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Alpine Pure Hoppiness pours somewhere between tangerine and orange, with just a little bit of haze to it. There's about a finger of white foam serving as a head. Head retention is not bad, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is a complete hop bomb. It's a citrus-tropical overload, with pineapple and grapefruit shining through in particular. Orange and mango show up as well. There's just a barely there flash of sweetness at the start, before a loud, yet pleasant bitter bite briefly take over. The last flavor to come is a spot on recreation of that incredible hop bouquet from the nose. The body is nice and light, but with a certain creaminess to it that you don't always find in IPAs. The carbonation is fairly bubbly, adding a liveliness to the beer and the hops in particular. This is right up there with Nelson for inclusion in my top 5 IPA/IIPas, and cements Alpine as one of, if not the best breweries when it comes to hoppy beers.","axeman9182","Oct 20, 2011"
4.23,-3.4,5,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"OVERALL: This is a solid Double IPA. It is very well balanced and I can appreciate a big, hoppy DIPA with a focus on the hops and not so much the malt. At 8%, this is quite an easy-drinker and it is very refreshing.","StoneTSR","Oct 09, 2011"
4.23,-3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O: A really good DIPA that is close to greatness. I could see how this could be amazing on tap with more carbonation and livelier hop presence/punch. That said, it definitely is a DIPA that needs to warm up. Close to room temp it's much more "ripe". Perhaps I need to next trade for fresh growlers to see if this can be an A+ DIPA.","Satchboogie","Oct 07, 2011"

4.17,-4.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This one pours a light bodied bright copper in color with a one finger bright white head. It smells of crisp and clean pine, light grapefruit, other citrus fruits, and also features some slight floral notes. The flavors are an array of grapefruit, clean pine, slight malty sweetness and a hoppy, bitter finish. It isn't overly sticky and is a pretty nice drinker.

4.07,-7.1,4.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall this is my least favorite Alpine beer to date, but that is like saying you are the shortest midget in the Lollipop Guild. Nelson and Exponential Hoppiness are just in a different class than this beer. In a category that is hard to wow now-a-days, this one falls a tad short for me. Still a great beer and definitely recommended but not a "necessary" find in my opinion. Alpine makes some serious epic beers so anything you can find from them (that is a hop-forward) will definitely be worth your while.","claspada","Sep 23, 2011"

4.55,3.9,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This pours a brilliant pale gold that's largely transparent with a bit of cloud to it. The head was thin, but may have been a product of pouring down the side of the glass at a slow pace. The nose is pretty mild and subdued. Not one of the most pungent hop profiles by any means. Some subtle citrus...no pine. Once this slips between the lips, it's party time. This is one fantastic fuckin' beer. The citrus and pine finally make an appearance, as do the hops. Everything is so incredibly balanced. There isn't any one aspect that dominates this beer, which is refreshing. An expertly orchestrated brew, no doubt. The mouthfeel is marvelous. It doesn't have that tongue scorching effect that makes you wonder if you'd ever be able to taste anything else again...but at the same time delivers a wonderful, citrusy presence with a lingering grapefruit taste. I had a wonderful day of beer drinking, and I just didn't imagine that the first beer I cracked when I got home would be able to top it. Right up there with Abner for today's best.","Retail1LO","Sep 17, 2011"

Taste- sweet pear, caramel butterscotch, the hops are all west coast and citrus- very little to no bitterness. So buttery. On the end, there is a resurgence of orange citrus hops, and then a buttery caramel ending after it. This is a really nice IIPA- so tropical, so well balanced, nice mouthfeel- not too syrupy, but it lets you know that it has some thickness to it. Up there with the best of them for sure. I am officially ISO Exponential Hoppiness, haven't tried a single Alpine beer that I've been less than thrilled with yet. Bravo!","lnashsig","Aug 28, 2011"
4.64,5.9,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Although I think the carbonation suffered a little from the growler format, I really enjoy this beer, and it definitely ranks highly for me in terms of worlds' greatest Imperial IPA. It has a wonderfully rich nose and the flavors follow suit. It is smooth with a light body that allows this to be a perfectly refreshing IPA regardless of how hot it is outside. Now, if only I could get a keg of it in San Jose....","peacebone116","Aug 22, 2011"

4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Wow. The taste is just an explosion of hops. Bittering hops come first and then those aromatic hops with the tropical and citrus flavors.

Pours mostly clear amber, but there are some odd floaties in suspension. Nice, chunky white head that is lacing quite nicely. Aroma has loads of fruit: mango, papaya, orange and maybe some grapefruit along with some pine. Taste is sweet with some sharp bitterness. Medium bodied with an oily/slick texture. Bitter finish, but very well balanced. This is a nice, bright DIPA that really hits the flavor profile that I like best.","trappistlover","Jul 15, 2011"

Let me explain. Corporal William Herboreal had been working as the ships botanist on an experimental mission to Titan, one of the outer moons of, well that’s not important. Upon discovering a new strain of humulus lupus, an advanced strain of hops, the oil was potent enough to power the ship, too powerful even. We cascade through time and sheered the space barrier in a way that even Immanuel Kant couldn’t’ have predicted. THE HOPS WERE TOO INTEGRATED. He kept feeding hops to the engine, its juniper rancor filling the cabin. But now we have crossed the line, fallen through time, living in the land of the hops.

4.05,-7.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: Another very solid offering from Alpine. They really have yet to disappoint, but I think their single IPA's are more enjoyable. Nelson and Duet are both so good, I couldn't help but have some soaring expectations coming into Pure Hoppiness. It's not fair to the brewers, but one can dream. I'd still take this over a great many in style, but if I reach for an alpine brew I think I'd grab one of their equally sessionable single IPA's.","Cavery","Jun 19, 2011"

If a demon appeared before me and told me I was forced to accept pure hoppiness as the only IPA in my life, I could not curse him (to put it in the strangest and most roundabout terms possible). However, I must admit my let down when I got double duet in the nose and less complex, hop-juiced taste. Still better than the vast majority of even top IPAs out there, but I'm not sure why it seems to often be prized above the more widely available Duet and Nelson.","Klym","Jun 19, 2011"

Smells like sweet citrus fruit, tangerine and grapefruit, along with strong pine and subtle caramel malt. Incredibly hoppy flavor. This isn't a hop bomb by any means, just a fairly well balanced west coast DIPA . Pine and citrusy flavors come together up front to provide a blast of hoppiness, a little bit of caramel malty sweetness rounds out the middle and provides temporary relief until the finish which brings about a huge oily and bitter hop finish. Very sticky lingering mouthfeel that keeps the bitterness around for ages after the drink is empty. Medium-full bodied for the style with slick/smooth low carbonation.

Retention is fair, but lace is sticky and copious. A moderate amount of tiny carbonation bubbles. Aroma is a wonderful balance of grapefruit and caramel with the citrus taking a slight edge. Soft to medium soft mouthfeel and medium body. Flavor is a lot like the aroma, but more emphasis on the hops. Not overly sweet like many DIPAs, but on the dry side. Mild and long bitter finish. Spectacular.","LittleDon","Apr 23, 2011"

Tastes of pine/citrus zest hops up front with a caramel malt finish. Slight pineapple too. Mild bitterness in the mouth after each sip. Good carbonation leaves a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

There is a little bit of fruity hop aroma but this is a deep forceful hop presence, not for the meek or faint of heart. The beer tastes a little sweet at first with a little biscuity malt, but that quickly fades as the deeply resinous hops rolls over the tongue. The beer is perfectly carbonated with thick full mouthfeel and just enough playful bubbles to keep it light. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer was very tasty, living up to expectations","Soonami","Feb 19, 2011"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, strong citrus, lemongrass, grapefruit, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was quite the exceptional brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were nothing short of excellent. The citrus aspect of this one definitely brought this brew up to another level. This one is really worth the trouble of seeking out if you have not had it before.

Citrus undertones help to balance the entire taste attack. Very green on the aftertaste, with pine notes lacing the hops flavors. Bittersweet aftertastes, blended of hops and citrus.

Chunky textured rises up above the rim of my glass, aromatics play the part cutting through your senses with grapefruit pith, sweet baby aspirin tones and herbal grassiness. Sweet sugar coated hops come through with a strong long lived bitterness this is West Coast IPA. I actually enjoy the diacetyl put forth in these beers, I don't see it as an off flavor just a nice complimentary flavor compared to most other big hoppy beers out there. I'm thoroughly impressed with the three IPAs I've had thus far. Big brash bitter but balanced with a nice biscuit breadiness/buttered bread really comforting malt profile with herbaceous, spicy hops and citrus grapefruit pith. Pretty incredible tasting IPA, I'm glad to have the opportunity to try these brews. This is rounded out from front to back hop flavor hits the palate oily slick with resin, medium to fuller bodied soft fluffy carbonation gotta love this stuff. Inredible drinkability compared to most big hoppy ales, this one is full of finesse.

I did pick up some pine in the nose along with some faint bready malt sweetness. Very nice aroma. Not surprisingly, the taste is big on citrus hops as well. I got even more pine in the taste especially with the finish, which was nice and pleasantly bitter yet smooth.

The malt profile is lacking a little bit but the hops are fresh and definitely present. The mouthfeel is a touch thin, yet highly smooth and easy to pair with light seafood dishes and chicken.

It was the sort of thing that causes a couple of east coast lager brewers that I know to muse on whether the brewer may have forgotten to add malt. There was malt, though, as evidenced by the outstanding lacing throughout. For me, it was an indulgence in my hop habit.

Alpine Beer Company has raised the bar for hop aroma, nose, mouthfeel and aftertaste. Opening a bottle of Pure Hoppiness is like spraying an aromatherapy can around you -- except instead of lavender and jasmine, the air becomes filled with a citrusy-floral aroma which invites you to investigate and discover the pot of gold at the end of the brown glass bottle.

The bitterness is there at the finish, but this is not one of those screw-with-your-mouth hop bombs that leaves your mouth numb. Instead, this is a pleasant and well-balanced brew, albeit hop-focused. This characteristic is what seperates the great DIPA's from the others for me and this IS a great DIPA. The hype is justified.

There is little bitter taste, rather I am picking up a nice mellow even taste the beer. To me, this tastes more like an IPA than a DIPA.

4.26,-2.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep copper color, not too dark, but not super pale. Very clear. The head is huge, nice and sticky looking, which leaves a cascade of lace with each sip. Very nice looking. The smell is pungent, leafy, and floral. Suprisingly, it lacks a real frutiness, but there are notes of citrus rind, like the white stuff, the bitter, not too fruity stuff. Though it really does smell like just like hops (dried flower buds, full of pollen and resinous aromatics). Nice, but I wish there was a little more fruit. The taste comes back with some fruit, not flesh, juicy, sweet fruit, but like grapefruit and bitter orange. Maybe a tiny bit of mango, but the bitter outer edges of the flesh. And it's also pumped up with a ton of grassy, piney tastes, which of course, begin to distract you from the fruitiness. The bitterness is nice, like a little kick, but it doesn't overwhelm the hop flavor and the slight sticky maltiness. You do get a quite sticky maltiness, mixed in with a little alcohol, but the alcohol is certainly subdued (which is a characteristic I really like in a DIPA. Tastes in a lot of respects like liquid flowers, resinous, the felling of pollen, leafy bitterness, a little peachy, super dry. Very nice. And as it warms, you start to notice the sweetness, and you start to get more sweet orange. The body is around medium, and very dry, with good moderate carbonation, just enough of a bit to keep it lively. And the hop resins really make it stick, giving you a little flavor to stay around and think of. But really, this is very nice. It has the kind of balance you expect in a DIPA, enough to distract from overwhelming bitterness, and really provide a nice body and the tiny amount of sweetness needed to make the fruitiness of the hops pop. Really, though, the hops shine, and the resinous, pungent varieties of hops. Very raw hoppiness. Maybe a little more fruit, and a bit stronger of a smell could put help this surpass all others, but as it is, there may only be 2 or 3 ahead of it. Really a brilliant DIPA.","taylorhamrick","Apr 11, 2010"

EH obviously offered more hops, but in the bottle we tried they tasted as being added for the sake of being big and hoppy and lacked the overall balance and awesomeness of this beer. Additionally I found the aroma for this beer to be nearly perfect, a blend of citrus and pine, and much more agreeable to me than EH. Flavor and body are certainly hoppy and brutal on the palate, but if you've had many of the other big IPA/DIPAs the balance and smoothness of this hop bomb are remarkable. The hops and their bitterness is supported by a strong grain and caramel malt body. Overall, incredible balance for a hop bomb DIPA, I need to find more of this beer.","yourefragile","Mar 27, 2010"

Usually the aromas of IPAs blend together but this one is very unique to me. The nose isn't really overpowering with hops but there are still plenty present. A very nice citrus sweetness is also present but not quite like the other IPA's. I think there is a lot of caramel and malts present as well. After allowing the brew to warm up a bit, the taste is dominated with hops, but without a very bitter aftertaste. Some pines and the citrus fruits linger on the palate.

It didn't seem to have the piney taste I thought it would, but that is probably because it's not super fresh. It also has a slight malt character that helps support the hops so you don't rip your tongue apart.

At 8%, and having brewed some of these myself, when I see a DIPA that has this clarity, and bright amber color, I am impressed. The aroma is an absolute delicious citrus hop explosion. There are some floral and pine hints, but this one definitely has some of my favorite American hop varieties in it to produce such a lip smacking citrus aroma. Taste follows much what the aroma would indicate. A nice punch of citrus hop bitterness is not overwhelmed by the sweet malt backbone. I like my hops right front and forward, and thats what this beer has. A nice slick mouthfeel, due to high hop usage I assume. Amazingly, with this high hop profile, the beer remains incredibly drinkable, not to mention I am still stunned by the 8% ABV.

It pours with a generous two fingers of head that has a good amount of retention and lacing evern after the first 5 or so drink. The beer pours a bright orange color, almost reminds me of a less cloudy american wheat in color. The carbonation is pretty pronounced on this ale which I really like because it really gets the sweet citrus and hop smell right up into you nose during every drink and I love to smell my beer while I drink it. Overall, the beer smells more malty than hoppy, but this may be as complex a smell as I have every smelt with a DIPA. Smells citrusy, hoppy, malty sweetness with an earthy undertone....in one word delicious. The taste is much the same. It doesn't blow you out of the water with hop bitterness, instead it seems to have a boat load of flavor and aroma hops that make the beer tast absoloutely devine. The mouthfeel is light and appropriate for the beer. This is one hell of a DIPA, one of the best I've had, and unlike most I feel like I could drink bottle after bottle and not get tired of this brew. Its scarry that its 8% ABV and I think they should change the name to A Hoppy Night in Jail, cause thats what could happen. One final note, I enjoyed this beer the first time I had it more due to the fact that it was fresh.

Then I remembered back to when I had exponential hoppiness, which was likewise flavorful and not too bitter; seems to be their style, and I like it. This is pretty ridiculously drinkable, but at the same time, the flavor seems a little light and muted. I'm getting a good deal of oily and resiny hops in the mouth, and just a kiss of honey sweet malt carrying it. Not really light bodied, but the oily feel that the ridiculous amount of hopping brings makes it slide quite slickly through the mouth. Alcohol is barely detectable; hardly feels like 8%. The finish is like hop flowers lingering lightly over your tongue. For a beer that is pretty much simply liquid hop flavor, I can't see it getting much better than this, but is it so much to ask for a little malt?","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

4.05,-7.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured a 22oz bomber into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a crystal clear honey orange, with a decent 2 inch orange-cream head that left just a hint of lacing. I will say, this is the first beer that right after I poured it, I said to myself, "Wow this looks like a beer poured in a beer commercial". Pure Hoppiness would have definitely received a 5 if the lacing were a bit stickier. The aroma is a subtle yet distinct infusion of orangey citrus and pine needles. This is a wonderful example of a beer where both styles of hops are very prevalent in the nose. Unfortunately, there is really no hint of malty sweetness, which is supposed to be there in a DIPA. The flavor is a bit subdued for me. There are definitely prevalent hops, bunches of citrus and a bit of pine, but the bitterness just isn't there. Also, like I said earlier, there really is not a malt presence in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied and just a bit effervescent. No real resiny mouthfeel noted. This is a great beer, but a DIPA, I don't think so. This is just a stronger IPA and is definitely lacking some of the qualities that I look for in my double IPA's. If this was reclassified to an American IPA, I would positively reconsider my scores and put this up with Bell's Two Hearted, Firestone's Union Jack, and Ballast Point's Sculpin.","hwwty4","Jan 24, 2009"

So damn light and crisp, it's hard to believe this is 8%; I've had IPAs of 6% ABV that felt heavier and maltier.

The hops are very fresh with sweet citrus feel. They do have a bit of grassy bitter but this is very well balanced by a lovely malt balance all along the backbone of this beer. Bitterness is very long and well received on the mouthfeel. Alchol is scary well hidden on this beer, maybe only peeks out with the boldness of the hops.

Hoppy but altogether creamy with an oily piny after taste that lingers appropriately. The lighter creamy body contributes significantly to its easy drinkability. Full flavored, the creamy texture is coming from the sweeter malt component. It doesn't come across as being a BIG beer.

Smells very fresh like just squeezed grapefruit juice and orange juice with some zest tossed in. Nice. The taste is more of the same of those delicious, citrusy, juicy, hops but this time with a pronounced pine finish as well. This beer drinks clean and pure, and while the malt is there, it clearly plays secondd fiddle to the hops. The hops are intense enough to feeel sticky and even spicy on the finish.

Left generous amounts of thick lace behind on the glass. The nose on this beer was incredible. Strong floral hop aromas, tons of thick sweet malt, loads of semi sour grapefruit, lemon zest, and some brewers yeast. Awesome. The taste of this beer was quite exceptional as well. Hops, sweet balancing malt flavors, grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, and more hops. A little bit of pine and yeast make themselves present in the smooth finish.

And what a nice hop character it has. Lots of grapefruit, some floral, some grass, some spice...still, it's mostly the grapefruit. A darn good sample of a hoppy DIPA and yes..I *do* love examples of the style where the malt shares the thrown with the hops. Sometimes, you look for that malt-hop balance in a DIPA and sometimes you don't. When they are done right, I can appreciate both and this one fits the bill. The 8%abv is very well hidden.

This poured a very bright and very hazy amber with a large sticky head of lace on top. Great retention never really let it fade, but rather just slowly sick down into a nice layer across the top. Deep smell of very sweet orange floral bouquet. Had a bit of a musty kind of odor in the back could not really place it, but it was still very hoppy, just a lot more balanced then I thought it would be. The flavor was sort of light with a very nice creamy consistency to it. Again somewhat musty bread like flavor was underlying the deep floral hoppy smells. A very nice flavor mix actually and kept it from being one of the excruciatingly bitter hop profiles you have actually come to expect from them. The full flavor itself was quite unique and unlike anything I had tried before, but that in of itself was a very good thing. Very drinkable as the 8% abv was not even noticeable for me. Overall I was very impressed with the depth on this one. I had expected it to be rather similar to the other big west coast IPAs but was very surprised when it showed up to the table packing a different kind of punch, one with more depth and flow to it and something that was more in tune with itself, rather then just loaded down with as much cascade as possible. This is something you should definitely try, and honestly in a class of its own, a very nice beer.","mikesgroove","Nov 20, 2007"

Aroma is a nice range of citrus fruits, apple, sweet cherry and sticky, sweet malt. Some pine notes are also hidden in the back of the dominant citrus hops. The taste is surprisingly balanced. It is a well crafted DIPA but it didnt wow me. The name Pure Hoppiness I was imagining a bitter bliss, but I didnt get that with this beer because it has a very adequate amount of malt to tame this beer from being bitterer than it is.

Mouthfeel is perfect, fairly light bodied with the right amount of carbonation. For a DIPA, this baby goes down so smooth. Probably one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had to date, pick up this treat for sure.","BeerTruth","Aug 14, 2007"

Strong floral to piney hop smell with a hint of grapefruit. Crisp, bitter and very hoppy initial flavor with a hint of grapefruit. The malt base is good but doesn't quite balance with the strong hops. Nice moderately bitter aftertaste that is medium to long lived and very pleasant. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel that remains crisp and alcholic. Try pairing it with rosemary encrusted lamb chops. I would definitely purchase this again, and I have been very lucky to have a couple of friends travling to San Diego, bringing me back some of this fine ale.

I've just started home brewing, so I can sometimes pick out what type of hops are being used by the smell, but with this, they intermingled and fed off eachother to create an almost supernatural aroma. The taste was like the smell, but was complemented nicely by the sublte malt back-bone. They really let the hops take over making my face pucker and distort in joy.

The flavor was very hoppy with a piny, resinous flavor and none of the fruity grapefruit flavors. There is little alcohol or other fermentation characteristics.

The first whiff is classic San Diego IPA style - big piney hops with danky floral notes. Taste is smooth and clean with lots of grapefruit and pine punching your tongue around. Theres a nice caramel malt in the background to help balance things out a little and make it very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth, clean and lightly resinous finish.

The combination between the sweet hop and the caramel malt sweetness really comes across as spun sugary goodness. Flavor hits me with a tease of bitterness before swallowing. This is followed immediately by incredible sweet grapefruity American hop and caramel malt. It finishes nice and sweet with a moderate bitterness that hangs on just enough to balance.

There's a lot going on with the aroma...initial whiffs reveal some grassy hops, also some woody ones. A deeper whiff reveals frankly what one gets when they stick their nose in a bag of fresh hops...very nice. Tastewise, one is rewarded with solid medium mouthfeel, low carbonation, and hops upon hops.

4.37,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Thanks to XLPerro for bringing it up North. A hophead experience, over-the-top of IPA with the seven different hops. Definite hop bite not for everyone. Grapefruit aroma and taste there, very dry after. Very aromatic hops. Grassy, leafy, piney thick mouthfeel. A bit of fruit and carmel mid-sip. Moderate carbonation. The salad to my meat dish.","Sammy","Oct 23, 2004"

I'm heartened by the fact that I have one more bottle, but depressed that I don't have easy access to this mother's milk of a beer. Alpine's PH is yet another reason to curse the two most vile words in a BA's vocabulary: limited distribution.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 21, 2004"

4.38,0,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one beer I have wanted to try for a long time. Now that I got a hold of 3 bottles I couldnt wait to crack it open. This poured out a hazy golden orange body with a tall off white head. As this was consumed sheets of lacing were left decorating the sides of the glass. The aroma was filled with citric hops as well as floral ones, this is one of the most hoppy aromas I have had the pleasure of smelling. Also noted in the scent was piney smells but not much malt was detectable at all. With the first sip you know you are in for an all out hop assault citric hops jump on your tongue, grab hold and dont let go. Notes of pine and slightly sweet malt are present but take a back seat here. The after taste is bitter and dry leaving your mouth caked in a hoppy bitterness. Everything done with the hops is done big, but not to the point of excess. Mouthfeel is creamy and about medium. This goes down pretty easily considering the huge hoppiness of it. I was not disappointed at all with this, except that it is not readily available near me.","meathookjones","Aug 31, 2004"
4.32,-1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Don't let the hops fool you either, this beer has a solid malt backbone, which allows the hops to take center stage in a full mouth-pleasing manner. The malt peeks out up front and also appears in the finish with a biscuit like note. Quite enjoyable! I like that this IPA is much more focused on the hop aroma and flavor than the bitterness.","Gueuzedude","Jul 28, 2004"
4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer after disemboguing from the 22 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a luminous golden amber color, the head a majestic white crown upon the body, the texture creamy, and the lace a satin sheet to lie upon the glass. The aroma of hops is what this beer is about, sweet and inviting, fresh, crisp, a treat for all the senses. Start is ambrosial, the malt profile perfect, the top middling in its feel to the palate, finish has a delightful acidity, the hops perfection, the aftertaste desert bone dry and long lasting, what a magnificent beer, my ever lasting gratitude to the fine people at Alpine for this elixir of life.","Gusler","Jun 19, 2004"
4.77,8.9,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear, rather darkish gold, lightly carbonated and with a moderate white head. Hop aroma is lovely -- sharp and piney with a big citric acidity. A mild alcohol aroma comes through as the beer warms. The flavor is dripping with sappy, spurcey hop bitterness. Sweetness is held to a minimum, despite the relatively low carbonation. The malt contributes a nice toasty background to the hop headliner, but yields in the end to a delicate, flowery hop finale. Alcohol warmth is present but mild. A delightful beer from the bottle, and pure heaven on tap.","mzwolinski","Jun 08, 2004"
4.75,8.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Even better off the tap. The pour and the color were the same as the bottle version. The smell was a bit more pronounced with a little smoother hop scent than the bottle but just as good. The flavor and the mouthfeel were much better on tap. The malty middle came out much more and balanced the beer just enough to make it near-perfect, and the mouthfeel was much more creamy and easy going. A great beer indeed.","Dmann","May 19, 2004"

4.32,-1.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This double IPA poured a clear, amber color with white foam. The smell was a strong and persistent fruity-chewy hop aroma with some malt backing it up. The taste was naturally dominated by the chewy, resinous hops, but the hops were not really over the top and were nicely balanced with the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly sweet with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The dry, hoppy flavor lingered on the tongue pleasantly. This was a very nice beer, and I wish I could have another.","UncleJimbo","Jan 28, 2004"

4,-8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"The light amber body has an off-white head that laces with great gusto.

4.06,-7.3,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Medium brown color. Small head. Aromas are very nice floral hops. Medium bodied IPA. A hop fest in a glass. The malts are really overpowered by the hops in this beer. The hops are floral, grapefruity, spicy, piney and bitter; take your choice cause they are all here in this beer. As the name implies it a hop bomb and very bitter, yet it still manages to have some smoothness to it. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter.","beerguy101","Oct 06, 2003"

4.35,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Wow that is a damn good IPA that BA xlperro turned me on to. The golden orange color belies the strength lurking within. Off-white frothy head sits high atop, throwing off strong, but sweet aromas of hops, flowers, pine, and citrus. The hop flavor wallops the tongue, and leaves a tingly pine flavor, with bits of orange peel, then rolls butterscotch over the sides. Grassy hop bitter lingers in the back of the mouth. Thin white lace dots the inside of the glass. This is a great beer. Now how do I get some more?","far333","Sep 14, 2003"
3.94,-10,3,4,4,4,4,"Rerated when sampled from a bottle. A far better hop experience in a bottle. It's amber clored with a whitish head. This has a nice flavor and is a must try for hop heads. Too bad that this is hard to come by, even in southern californa.","jcalabre","Sep 07, 2003"

4.59,4.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This ale pours a crystal clear gold-that-borders-on-amber body. The rocky white head holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose is outrageous with rich, resiny, piney, fruity and citrusy hops! It's most impressive and very welcoming! The body is medium, and it's smooth across the palate due to a very fine and moderate-level carbonation. Although the nose is astounding, more hops come out in the flavor, over a biscuity and caramel-laced malt. It's got a solid bitterness to it, but it's really well-balanced and finishes dry with just enough bitterness to cleanse the palate. An all-around great beer... the hop aroma is brilliant; the hop flavors come through clearly; the malt base is not overdone (and works as the perfect platform to show off the hops); and the bitterness level is perfectly balanced to accentuate the beer and keep you coming back for more. Well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Jul 25, 2003"

3.55,-18.9,4.5,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Nice looking beer. Great head that's almost too happy to be alive. You have to pour this one carefully. It's a slightly sandy head but very sticky. The first glass laced, the second glass left thick patches of foam stuck to the sides of the glass. I may need a scouring pad to clean the glass. The body is solid amber. It looks a little thin though. I don't mean pale, I've seen paler IPAs (Sweetwater IPA is more yellow and less red), just thin. The aroma is heavenly. Big fruity hops, a bit of sweetness, a very aromatic beer. The flavor is where things drop off. The rich hop profile thins out to mostly just a bitterness. It would have been nice if the juiciness had carried through from the aroma, but it didn't. The malt is seriously lacking. I got a glimpse at a nice caramel and biscuits malt at the first sip but then it was lost under the hops. It's not that the hops are really overpowering, it's just the malt backbone isn't there to hold it up. It makes the beer a bit thin. This is also a really dry beer. It's one thing in a lager like a pils to be dry, but I actually prefer my pale ales to be less dry. A little sweetness really helps to balance the hops and give a little character. If the flavor was as good as the appearance and aroma this would be an incredible beer. Still not bad though.","aracauna","Jan 31, 2003"
