"A double. Good flavor. Very hoppy"
""
""
""
""
""
"I pick up mango, and a slight grapefruit taste. There is a fruit, and a sweetness that I can't figure out, and it helped the feel and taste. I liked the unknown character that I couldn't pin point. This was a bit malty for me, but it didn't take over this beer completely."
"4.25/5"

"It's a good double ipa. But not as good as the scores it gets. Glad I was able to try it. Pretty balanced beer. I grabbed some off Flavors on it. Like olive on the nose?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A big boozy dipa. Bitter and malty which is kinda an odd combo. One bomber of this and you're on your way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an amazing DIPA!!"
""
""
"Good color and head. Smell and taste are quite boozy, but overall pretty good. I'd put it below Shipyard XXXX and 90 min but above Green Flash/Ballast point varieties."
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delish quad.  Drinking a 2011 vintage..."
""
"From its near Crimson hue to a perfect mouthfeel and hop/malt balance, it is as well-crafted a beer for the style on Planet Earth.  Yes, I like it, especially as ridiculously fresh as it is right now.  Thank you Avery."
""
""
""
"Maltier than most IIPA's, poured a dark amber color. Bought it on a whim. I didn't realize what I had. It was delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a HF snifter/wine glass. Pours a dark, rusty auburn color with about a one finger head. Laces well, and there is an abundance of sediment floating around in there. The bottle has been sitting in my fridge for about 3-4 weeks. Medicinal smell, some alcohol in the nose. Taste is sweet, caramel like. This is a malty imperial IPA, alcohol is present in the taste but not overwhelming. This one is a sipper."
""
"Very nice and complex. Not overly sweet like many doubles. The finish is slightly too astringent, but this is splitting hairs."
""
""
"1 pint 6 oz bottle poured into an IPA glass (labelled """RELEASE No. 21 JAN 2015"""). Slightly hazy, orange amber; good frothy head of off white foam and nice lacing. Full nose and flavor; plenty of malt body, grains and caramel without being too sweet; layers of hops - grapefruit rind, herbs, resin, tobacco, earth and slight sweeter fruit. A bit more than medium body with moderate carbonation. Balanced, full and all round enjoyable."
"A very good and powerful brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious taste and smell. Tastes of mango citrus flavors one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"Bomber poured into shaker pint and shared with Tim K. Orange and clear body with an off-white head that sticks and leaves lace patches. Aroma is citrus (mostly grapefruit), tobacco, honey, and caramel malt. Taste is moderately bitter with a touch of malty sweetness, centered around grapefruit peel, pine, hop resin, and caramel. Medium body, slightly creamy texture, average carbonation, bitter finish with a hint of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Little to no head. Dark unfiltered look. Smell really malty, sort of like hopageddon. This initial taste is very crisp with a subtle bite to the cheeks. Afterwards, very malty with some hop taste. Also, they did a great job in hiding the 10%"
""
"O - 4.5 - This is a really great imperial IPA and the tartness of the taste is something unique and will drink a little off the beaten path and be something different for the seasoned IPA drinker. Well worth trying for fans of the style and you cant beat 7 bucks for a bomber!"
"Very Tasty Hop Forward Double IPA"
"Overall: Such a tasty beer, fantastic when it's fresh. Ranks right up there with some of the best DIPAs."
"Really good IPAD. My top 5 favorites!"

"I enjoyed it!"
""
"Pours a dark orange color with a one finger foamy head. It has a deep, earthy flavor to the hops, almost like a British ipa. There is also a good amount of pineapple and mango. Green apple and a sweet, bready malt. The flavor is intensely malty, but it has enough bitterness to support it. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Overall, this is a top notch ipa, however, i would enjoy a little more intensity in the hop department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an above average DIPA, but no where near the big boys.  Too much malt which is what Avery is shooting for, a """balanced""" DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Slick, almost oil mouth feel, the hops flavor is not as heavy as I anticipated for a dipa,very mellowed out by a wave of malty bread flavor on the back end.  Nice mix of flavors, great balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright crisp clean, little bit of citrus, little bit of citrus zest, a little bit of pine. Very excellent"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a yellow amber with white head. Smells of grapefruit, barley, piney.  Tastes of sweet malts, citrus, pine, gassy. Full bodied and medium carbonation. Leaves a piney sweet aftertaste with pine resin on the lips."

"O: I really liked this beer. Couldn't find it anywhere when I went to Denver, so I was surprised when BevMo in SoCal had a few.  This is really a great DIPA IMHO and may be one of the easiest to drink I've ever had.  I could see how some hop lovers may be left looking for more, but it was almost perfect for my palate."

"A sticky sweet, aggressively hopped masterpiece.  Strong citrus notes with bitterness that is present but not overwhelming, nice heat, sweat caramel malt body."

"Pours a deep, murky amber-orange with a thick light brown head, with decent retention and good lacing. One sexy looking beer. Smell is citrus heavy, with lots of grapefruit mixed in with a bit of caramel malt. Some pine as well. Taste leads with malts and a good deal of bitterness. Wonderfully sweet caramel malt lingers on the tongue after the first sip. The citrus comes booming through in the aftertaste-- a great sequence of flavor. A tiny bit of alcohol bite. Pine comes through more as it warms. Bitterness really sticks on the tongue. A little bit of breadiness comes through at the end. Despite the bitterness it is quite easy to drink. Not a lot of carbonation. A bit resinous. Overall, this stuff is like candy. It won't knock you on butt like the most powerful DIPAs, but it still balances strong taste with balance, and is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Amber body with a small white tan head. Smell is mild hoppy earthy dank. Taste is malty with lots of hops. Very well balanced beer."
""
""
"Overall - It's good, but not overly impressive. Maybe too much herbal dank flavor for my liking. Glad I was able to try it, but probably wouldn't buy it again, what with all the amazing DIPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium full body with medium low carbonation, warming."

"02/02/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Tons of horsepower hops-wise but well under control. At 10.5% this can & will be deceptive. Great brew."

"This beer right here; this beer right here, man, this beer right here should be called def! Cuz it tastes so good that I tune out everything. (Somebody please tell me they got the Kat Williams reference). Anyway, this beer is really good! I love IPA's as it is, but this one looks so damn pretty, feels like water and tastes like some of Maharaja's gold. I would highly recommend it for, well...anything but a day in the sun. I encourage anyone google searching this reference while standing in front of a frosty glass cooler at Specs or Gabriel's or wherever, to go ahead and reach back into the cooler and add a necessary 8 bucks to your bill."

"On tap at ACBF. One of the beers I really wanted to try and was really impressed by this. A think smoky, super thick DIPA, very resiny and very very tasty. Lots of really intense hoppy notes, thick piney and grapefruit with a strong liveliness as well, smooth malt body, an excellent DIPA. Worth seeking out, very complex and tasty."

"Would have again; worth trying if you're an IPA fan."
""
""
"Overall: This doesn't hold up to the greats. A bit too boozy and bitter for my liking. I had GL Chillwave before this and found that to be more enjoyable. However, I will consider reaching for this again when available"
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden, dark amber with finger width foamy head that quickly dissipates. Lacing dissipates quickly as well. Boozy, citrus odor. Can detect hints of apple as well. There is a mild hoppy tastes up front with a strong, malty, boozy aftertaste. It goes down very smooth. Definitely a beer for cold weather. Will warm you up like a Brandy or Congac. Very little hoppy aftertaste. Definitely a beer you want to sip by a warm fire."
"I had the pleasure of sampling this at the brewery's tap room just two days ago and really liked it (and rated it at 4.25), but must give this higher props after making it my first beer of the day. Bold balance and depth throughout with eye-popping zest to please the palate. I get additional flavor notes of apricot and dried peaches for some additional fruit-like notes. If big, beautiful IPAs are your thing, check out an offering of this monster."

"Pours a hazy dark honey color, thick head and lots of air bubbles inside as it recedes. Lacing isn't bad. Aroma is pungent, overripe oranges and peaches. Flavor really captures the sweet orange taste, strong caramel backbone, some grapefruit and a bittering aftertaste. A bit viscous but lacks a certain robustness that DIPAs usually come with. A good one for sure, but not top tier for me."
""
""
""
""
"After race reviews from friends I went into my tasting with high hopes.   The aroma was odd, kind of musty and odd, that of """beer sweat""" I was not pleasant on the nose.  The visual was of an dark maple syrup hue with slow flowing micro bubbles that cling to the edge of the class with a death grip.  Strong hoppy taste with some pine, clearly and imperial IPA.   Overall a good beer but the aroma was hard to get over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Release no.18 2014. Medium amber pour with a slight ruby cast. Excellent head and good lacing retention. Nice complex nose of citrus (grapefruit, mango, orange) and spruce hops over a rich caramel background. Almost full bodied with a creamy texture and a slightly above normal carbonation level that has a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is complex, but a bit unbalanced due to the alcohol content bite. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, flows to a rich caramel sweetness which is accompanied by a medium well rounded bitterness. It progresses to the finish where alcohol predominates over a residual sweetness, leaving an alcohol burn on the tongue and back of the throat. While outstanding, it could be improved by reducing the alcohol content a percent or two to achieve better balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty let down by this. I didn't get much hop presence other than pine and the mouth was pretty off. Very hot and bitter. I'd like to give this another go when I know it's super fresh but I couldn't see what the bottled on date was."
""
""
""
""
"O - I tried this beer years ago before I really started exploring stronger beers, different styles etc. This was a great homecoming. I love this beer. It smacks the mouth with booze and tartness but mellows almost as soon as it appears. It may be a beer that's been around for a while but it's greatness hasn't faded."
"poured into tulip. fairly dark, orange red. this beer does have some amazing flavors to it. but whats really amazing about it is the silkiness of the mouthfeel. it really does go a long way because I cant say I enjoy this more than dirt wolf or stone enjoy by IPA, when it comes to flavor (just 2 other DIPAS ive had recently)"

"This ale pours a deep copper color with a substantial white head and alot of lacing. The nose is very balanced with substantial hop and malt notes. There is also alot of booze on the nose (no surprise given the abv). The mouth is medium and coating and very pleasant. The flavor is balanced but shockingly boozy on the finish. I like a beer with alot of alcohol flavor but for those that don't like the burn, this is not for you."

"o I respect this beer--I like it when brewers worry more about the fullest expression of their ingredients. And though I respect it more than I enjoy it, I thought this was a fine beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has always been an impressive DIPA. This is a big beer that nails the bitterness and sweetness. It's a fun beer to drink. Well crafted. Good beer, it's always recommended. I do like DuganA better though, for what it's worth."
""
""
"Overall this is a great DIPA, glad I found it. I'd love to have it on tap somewhere super-fresh."
""

""
"O- reminds me of a bigger version of Ruination, with slightly more orange/tropical notes. Very good."
"Maharaja is not for the faint of heart, but fans of bitterness will find it to be in their wheelhouse. This one caters to the extremes, leaving no room for fine nuances to be discerned while sipping. One short pour at a time, it is enjoyable and can improve a meal of cheese and sausage."

"Update - After letting the Ale warm some I've noticed the bitterness has either mild some or I have grown use to it...the finish is much sweeter now...a hour into my first glass and I'm almost finished. I'd say let this puppy warm a little and you're going to have a much more enjoyable experience...cheers!"

"Batch 18. Pours a clear amber with a large long-lasting head. Great lacing. Lots of pineapple and peach on the nose with hints of caramel and biscuit which become more prominent as it warms. Lots of fruit on the front of the tongue, mostly grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Pine comes mid-palate followed by sweet malt. Finishes sweet with a hint of earthiness. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Overall a well crafted DIPA that's just a bit too sweet on the finish for me."
"good beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: One of my favorite brews. Must try, Avery did a great job on this one. Got this as an extra in a Pliny trade and I think I may like it a bit more (although they re very different) Cheers!"
""
""

"O - This is a toss up, there's some really great aspects to this beer and some that could have been blended a lot better. The characteristics remind me of an American Strong Ale, very thick, oily, moderate hop profile, molasses at times. As far as an IPA or DIPA goes, this is far from it. Malty at times and could have just been better. Very disappointed with Avery for this Malt Bomb."
""
"The beer has some nice hoppy aromatic notes, with a nice the malt sweetness in the aroma."

"Comments: If anything, I would like a little less Alcohol on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I get it now. I seem to forget that not all IPA's are west coast in style. While high in IBU's, the overall bitterness of this beer is actually relatively low. It's fruity and a touch spicy. It has notes of citrus and evergreen, but they are subdued in the context of this brew. Great stuff, and I'm surprised I hadn't picked it up sooner."
""
""
"dark peach color, little head. bitter hop aromas and tropical fruit, indiscernible which ones; and a cat urine taste (not in a bad way, I think). a little bitter, old hop generations, but a definitive standby. very decent. very consistent. I didn't know this was a seasonal, but glad I got an opportunity to try it this season...."

"Tried this one while I was in Missouri for a while and can honestly say it's not that great. Jai Alai is way better, Maharaja is waaay to earthy/dirty tasting, like a cheaper IPA. It's way to malty and does not live up to the hype. I would not buy it again."

"Pours a deep straw, almost amber orange with a persistent head and nice lacing. The nose is wonderfully complex bouquet of honey, pine, grapefruit, passion fruit, lime and malt. The thick malty sweetness acts as a backbone for both the high alcohol and bitterness of the hops. Layering over the malty sweetness are again flavors of grapefruit and resin/pine with hints of honeysuckle and mint. The after palate one this beer lasts forever, with a pleasant dance of malt and bitterness lingering on your tongue. An absolute delight to drink and revisit."
""
"Overall: A delicious, unique IPA that has both traditional and surprising elements to it. Manages to be both round and complex. The hops didn't take a backseat or anything, but I did feel they could have packed a bit more of a punch considering the style."

"Taste also showcases the caramel malts and earthiness at first. At first sip, I feel that these combination of these will keep it from being a DIPA I truly enjoy, as I usually go for more hop forward. However, the caramel and earth give way to a bit of spice and the hint of juicyness from the nose, orange seems to be the most noticable citrus. Has an incredible bready, juicy, resinous aftertaste that lingers and to me, makes the time in between sips even better than the sips themselves. Has a heavy mouthfeel, average for a DIPA, and high carbonation, above average for a DIPA."

"As far as IPAs go this must be decent because I tend to not like IPAs and I still enjoyed this. The after taste is super bitter (which is why I don't like IPAs) but the initial taste is fairly fruity and citrus-y. I would recommend it to IPA lovers or perhaps even people like myself who are really trying to like IPAs."
"It’s a great IPA. I get a lot of similarities to Pliny the Younger"
""
"Doing an imperial IPA tasting, this was second up in the line-up. Nice color, somewhat hazy color, nice thick mouthfeel and somewhat oily. Definitely strong lightly alcoholic burn, not overly bitter or herbal hop flavor, somewhat citrusy, mostly piney. Compared to Brew Dogs Hardcore IPA, this seems slightly dialed down in the nose and palate department, but overall still an exceptional double IPA."

"Overall it's not a bad beer. It has flavor but at the same time it seems so sweet. A little hard to get past the sweetness as I really appreciate bitterness from hops which I did not get a whole lot of in this beer. It is different than other DIPA's, a very malty beer overall."

"Unfortunately, I could find no bottling date, but knowing my bottle was new, I would say this beer ought be enjoyed as fresh as possible. Form what I can tell, most of the hops are late additions and their flavors will not survive long in the bottle."

"Got a hold of one that was super fresh and man is it good. Extremely hoppy yet well balanced with a ton of malts. A big, delicious beer. Great hop aroma, even better balanced taste. The higher alcohol content is pretty well hidden as well. Definitely want to get this one fresh. Had one in May earlier this year that was probably about 3-4 months old and it was just a malt bomb but this fresh one is fantastic"

"I see from the reviews here that a lot of people have had a much better experience with this beer than I did, so it may have been a bad bottle or at least a bottle with too much age on it. I couldn't find any dating on the bottle, but unless it was several years old, there's no excuse for it going THIS bad. But there are so many great DIPAs out there that I enjoy regularly, I will not be giving this one another shot."

"Been a while since I last visited the old Raja; let's see what he's up to today, shall we? This stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit rind, light leek, orange peel, pine resin, and plenty of toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavier influence of grapefruit and pine, a more caramel-y tone in the backbone, and some grass tossed in for good measure. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a fine and dandy hop bomb, indeed."

"Overall: I'm not sure I've ever had anything I've been particularly wowed by from Avery -- was hoping this would change things, but it appears the search continues."

"This is really a great beer. It's not as hoppy as you might expect for an ipa but its hoppy enough and very malty. I wouldn't mind having another one in the fridge."

"O: A great IPA with an excellent smell, which is by far my favorite aspect of this ale. I would assume a glass of pineapple juice is under my nose if I was blindfolded. I get big-time pineapple in the nose but citrus/hops in the taste."
""
""
"Overall: Very nice, complex DIPA with a different flavour profile than I'm used to with the other west coast DIPAs like Pliny, Sucks, Enjoy By. It's heavy on the malts which I appreciate, bringing a nice balance, but its not too overloaded with hoppy bitterness like Double Crooked Tree is. In this DIPA, the malts are the stars of the show here, with the hops contributing the atmosphere and lighting. It's somewhat like a very hopped up barleywine that is a bit less malty than typical barleywines. Drinks well, very complex and enjoyable- and different than the typical west coast DIPAs that I've had. It's a bigger, more complex version of the DFH 90 min. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
"There's intense DIPAs, and then there's this one. Super herbal and dry and boozy all the way. This took me some time to drink, in fact. Definitely an extreme IPA that has a good citrus flavor to it, as well as comfortable mouthfeel, but a lot of these aromas and flavors are really doing strange stuff when they meld with one another. I feel that this may have been an older batch but I still think a beer this monstrous should hold up just fine. If you like your IPAs super dank and earthy and don't mind several irregularities as I mentioned above, give this a shot. Wasn't a fan but I'd be open to have a fresher batch if given the opportunity."
""
""
""
""
"O - This was the first vintage I've had of this. I'm really surprised this somewhat goes under the radar of the craft beer world. Given the respect and stature Avery has become. You'd think an DIPA of this quality would be very sought after. Avery took this in a slightly different direction than most massive IPAs, and it'll be a flagship of that direction for years to come. Its a well done ale and not discussed enough."
""
""
""
""
"As an addendum to the previous review, I cellared this beer for a couple months to let the hops subside and I actually like it much better. The caramel malt characteristic really shines and seems to make it much more balanced than when I had it fresh."
""
"O - A very nice Imperial IPA. I enjoy the big malt bill that balances out the big hops. For a 10.4% beer, it doesn't seem that big, which is a compliment. If it wasn't for that 10.4%, I could drink a lot of this beer. Nice job Avery!!"
""
""
"O- this is definitely a hop lovers beer, the hops linger on the palate like very few beers that I've tried, so strong it almost provides an astringency to the flavor. Definitelt some uniquely defining flavors and one of my favorites of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A solid DIPA. Avoids being too boozy and balances well but still gets very hop forward. Well done. A please to sip and enjoy. Wonderfully complex and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O-I don't know if I actually like this beer as much as some of the more nuanced IIPAs out there, but I give credit where it is due, and if you like big, bold, in-your-face flavors, credit is due here. Somehow, the malts and fruity alcohol amplify the hoppy bitterness, and while the whole thing can be a bit much, but if you're buying this beer, you probably know what you are getting into."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tremendously tremendous IIPA holding true to form. This is like squeezing a grapefruit right into your mouth. This is one you can crush. I say amen to this this sir."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic BIG beer that delivers everything you want in a DIPA. I almost overlooked this when choosing my beer but glad I didn't. Another hit from Avery."
"O - an enjoyable beer. I think it would have been better off if it would have stopped around 7%. The citrusy and floral hop notes are great, but are overshadowed by alcohol heat and sweetness. Still, a good IIPA, compared to the average of what's out there, this is a good 2-3 notches better."
"There is a full bodied Pale Ale element to this IPA. Tons of malt flavor with hearty earthy notes like , tea leaves, grasses and caramel malt. No pine or floral hops can be found. At 102 IBU there is a very nice, smooth bitterness and at 10 percent there is an easy warmth. Only complaint is that there is a heavy dryness that assaults the palate in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lots of booze with this beer, but I enjoyed it anyway a very good brew by Avery."
"I was let down by what I think is best described as the body of this. I think I was expecting more of a fullness rather than a distinct and almost overwhelming booziness. As far as hoppiness, I like a much more bitter IPA then this. To me the bitterness was almost overwhelmed by the alcohol. I also tend to like more carbonation in my I DIPA, the mouthfeel of this was definitely short of what I was wanting. I think now, my standards for DIPA / IIPA are Alchemy Hour / Leviathan respectively. As much as I love Avery IPA in a can, this just falls disappointingly flat for me. Wouldn't recommend."

I am currently under the influence of this 10.5+ abv masterpiece and WOW, I could not tell the alcohol while I was drinking it. Not a hop forward DIPA, which is what made this such a surprising beer. Very happy to have this beer. Will buy in a bomber soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: thoroughly enjoyable. It's still identifiable as an IPA, has more flavor between the hops and alcohol than most DIPAs, and I really enjoy the citrus and floral notes that dominate the hop flavors."
"O: I'm not overly impressed by this beer. It just seems to be too much. It's over the top hop up front, over the top abv, and it's way more malty than I would have wanted out of a DIPA. This is not going to make my favorites list. In fact, I don't see myself ever seeking this beer out again in the future. There are just way too many better DIPA option out there."
""
"One of the best beers I've had lately. I'd go into further depth, but there's so many positive reviews I think it's a bit nuts to be skeptical on this brew. If it's on tap near you get one. I just had it at a local bar in northern Virginia that was insanely smooth and delicious with a full body."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; 2013 bottling, just released recently. Pours crystal clear orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, tangerine, pineapple, lemon, orange rind, caramel, floral, grass, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dank hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; with slight alcohol as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, tangerine, pine, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Nice amount of citrus and pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, pine, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, pine resin, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus and pine hop flavors; with a near perfect malt balance that does not overwhelm; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a light creamy, slick, and very sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA! Great balance and complexity of hop notes with nice malt balance; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."
"Overall: This is an excellent IIPA. A little on the maltier side, so if that is not to your tastes, you may not favor it as much. However, this has been a favorite of mine, and one I look forward to picking up every Spring. Easy to find when it's released if you can get Avery in your area. Price is somewhat reasonable for a bomber at $7.99 in my area. Would definitely recommend seeking this one out."

"O: Malt lovers' beer, sort of like Lagunitas Copper. Claims 102 IBUs, but I'm not really sure I believe that. While it's nowhere near as hoppy as a decent west coast IPA, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a rich, malty beer that non-hopheads might find more enjoyable. It also packs a punch at 10.4% abv."

"Glad to finally get around to reviewimg this. One of my favorite of Avery's offerings. Huge, bitter complex hops and a nice, sweet bready malt body. Not an every day IPA for me but it's a great occasional khop shock to the system."

"O - Wow, quite impressed by this brew. Looks perfect and smells just as good. Hop aroma far exceeds the typical DIPA and is unique and complex.

"Give Avery some credit. Maharajah and duganA are excellent DIPA's. They can hang with the west-coast, east-coast and midwestern DIPA's for sure. There is a strong floral/piney hop smell and taste that is complemented by a sturdy malt backbone making the beer sweeter than mos of the DIPAs I've tried. Sticky fizzy mouth feel. Pine resin aftertaste lingers. Beer is orange-gold with a thick off-white head that coats the glass in cottony lacing all the way down. Most frequently had this in 22 oz. bomber, but it improves in draft (if the bar knows what they're doing)."
"I haven't had Heady Topper or either of the Plinys yet, but if they're better than this (which I imagine they are) I'm excited for the day I try them."
"Overall, I really feel this beer could use some aging time to mellow out the harsh hop bitterness. There is definitely a substantial malt backbone that would better balance out the hoppiness if some of the bitterness was gone. Might have to pick another bottle up to stash away for 6 months or so."
""
""
"Avery usually delivers a great product and this beer did not disappoint! It was served in a 12 ounce tulip glass and the copper color immediately captured my attention! The thick 1.5 finger foam seemed to be just floating on top leaving a nice lingering sticky lacing on the glass. The bouquet was sweet with mild maltiness and caramel with bitter orange peel. The first sip totally enveloped my tongue like a warm comforter would my body in a cold winter day! The flavors of star fruit, grapefruit and blood orange with hints of mango are unmistakable and delightful with the blood orange and grapefruit lingering long after the sip is gone! This beer left me wanting more because of how delicious it is but be careful, at 10.4 ABV this beer will sit you down in a hurry! This is certainly one of those powerhouse beers you must take your time with to enjoy! Avery has hit it out of the park with this one! If you are a fan of the Troeg's Nugget Nectar then you will like this beer! It's like the Nugget Nectar on steroids! Well done Avery and thanks to the West Reading Tavern in West Reading, PA for serving it on tap!"

"22oz bottle. Crystal clear amber with a big off white head. Big all-hop aroma: grapefruit, citrus. Very American IPA so far. Big all-hop flavor too. I'm really enjoying the combination of floral, citrusy, and spicy hop flavors along with a little bit of bite. The finish is actually a little bit creamy...yeah, I'd bet the final gravity on this one is higher than many IPAs start fermentation at. But if this beer has any flaws, they're in the finish. It's too oily, and along with the high residual sugar and alcohol, it limits drinkability. But making a double/imperial IPA this well balanced is a feat and Avery has made something I'm happy to drink. Even if I still like Dogfish better. :P"

"Overall: This is an outstanding beer, one of the best brews I’ve had in a while…a great thing about living in Chicago is that we get great beer fresh…it’s really an underrated beer town, people around here love their craft brews…anyways, this is a fantastic brew that I was able to pick up in one of Chicagoland’s many Binny’s outlets…I knew it was fresh and wasn’t passing up the opportunity to try this renowned brew…in fact, I bought two and I’m glad I did, for the bottle says it’s “Extremely Limited”…I’m not sure exactly what that means, but I was willing to take my chances…turns out, I made the right call and will enjoy my second bottle with a friend…I couldn’t recommend this more, this brew is strong and flavorful and certainly lives up to the hype…get this beer fresh, drink cold and relax…(5/5)"

"O - I'm glad my wife liked the bottle! You can't go wrong with this IPA."
""
""

"O: Just a huge imperial IPA, but a bit of an overload. I feel the nuances of the hops were lost in the malt overload - could pass as a hoppy american barleywine. Really enjoyed it, a bit too boozy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very strong offering in the IIPA category. I think it has just a little too much bitter bite (it also is 102 IBUs), but I would definitely recommend this beer to any hophead because it has a very complex nose and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I think this is the one of the best DIPAs I've had that goes for balance. I can't get enough hops, and while this would seem like a devastating hop bomb to newcomers, it's more of a balanced take to the style in my opinion. I really do enjoy it because it's got a nice hop profile and a nice malt profile to go along with it. Highly recommended."
"Purchased a bomber on Superbowl Sunday and fridge-aged since then from Batch 17 (2013). ABV appears to be dialed up one notch (bottle says 10.4%). All the hype over Hopslam and I think this is every bit its equal, maybe a bit less fruity but has the same drinkability. Goes down easy and doesn't disappoint. A true winner from the Rocky Mountains and definitely in the rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is unlike most DIPAs I’ve had. Not saying it’s the best one out there, but it carves out its own identity. Tough to really put my finger on what makes it unique. Perhaps it’s the interplay between the strong malty backbone and the light hearted bitterness. Thoroughly enjoying this one."
""
""
"O: Great DIPA. It's a big one for sure, both in hoppiness and in the malt. It's kinda like Devil Dancer light in a way (I don't know why that stood out in my mind but it did). Lots of big, sharp hop flavors and aromas and with a huge malt base to back it up. Honestly balanced pretty well but then again I am pretty neck-deep in hops most days. To a newbie it would probably be overpowering (I remember having this years ago, it was almost undrinkable). Great beer for the hop lover."

"Amazing IPA never disappointed by the maharaja. Always get the citrusy grapefruit notes and right upfront with the hops. finishes nice and dry.tasty as hell! love it! I give it an A + top 3 IPA's all time. Avery is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries . it's like they can do no wrong."
""
""
"Decent DIPA, although maybe a tad overrated in my opinion. Little heavy on the malt, I would've liked to see a little more hop flavors jumping out, although the hop profile was pretty unique in its own right."

"Split a bomber with a friend. I have been looking for this for a while. Apparently in the wrong places. This one was bottled early in 2012. The look was there, but man was the nose off. The taste was worse. All the loads of hops that every raves about were all oxidized. Like a bad overhopped American barley wine. This was a drain pour. I will have to revisit a fresh bottle, then I will re-review. Lesson learned. Check the date before you buy!"

""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent beer, a very unique interpretation of the DIPA style. I really enjoy DIPA's (or any of pale ale styles) that do not try to overwhelm the drinker with pure hop power, but actually have a flavor and balance to them. That being said, this beer, as I mentioned, is literally like drinking a strong malty beer combined with a DIPA. It has such good flavor. Highly recommended, will drink and buy again."

"A huge beer with just not enough overall balance to really shine. Aggressive malt and hop profiles are often at war and come out a little worse for the wear. Individually the components are great, but together they just don't mix and leave me a bit confused, but not unhappy."

"Bomber poured into a perfect pint glass. About a finger of light tan almost white head, reduced to a thin layer, some retention. Golden orange color, haze, hints of red. Smell is heavenly, floral, sweet caramel, bready hops, overpowering. Taste is resinous, with pine hops, some fruit, caramel and malt. It's super sweet, with loads of texture. Mouthfeel is smooth, light carbonation. Overall great beer. It's not something I could have over and over again, but I thoroughly enjoy it on occasion. One of my top Imperials. Cheers."

"O: The hops, malt, and alcohol work in excellent combination to provide an outstanding experience in a DIPA. This is a very hoppy beer, so if you really don't get into the hops, you won't enjoy it.  It is also sweeter in flavor than most DIPAs I've had.  But if you've established your buds to handle the strong IBU, you are going to really enjoy this beer.  It is strong, and it hit me rather hard, so I would recommend a slow and cautious session.  But this is definitely a beverage I will find and buy again."

"This brew poured with a full finger of pure white head that left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The body is orange with a lot of carbonation. It also looks like there is some “stuff” floating in this. Interesting. On the nose, I get a lot of pine and grapefruit and a hint of sweetness on the end. On the taste, the first thing that I get is pine, then grapefruit and then another taste that I can’t really identify. I think it’s caramel or some nuttiness? This nuttiness hangs around until the finish and lingers for a while. The alcohol in this brew is significant, but it is insanely well hidden. This is a very enjoyable IPA. This brew was 102 IBUs, but doesn’t hit you in the face with hops. This would be up there are one of the best Imperial IPAs that I’ve had. Go out and get this if you haven’t tried it."

"O- definetly one of the better ones I've had, flavor an hop profile is ridiculous great malty backbone. A+"
""

"Update: Sampled the 2013 batch and found the alcohol to be much more pronounced than the 2012 batch. Still a tasty offering, but I enjoyed the 2013 version less as a result of this variance."

"Big winner here. big bottle is made to be shared. Not hard to finish, but this is an ass-kicker. So worthy."

"Overall - This bottle had a few months on it, and I'm taking this into consideration in my review, as I suspect a fresh bottle would have even brighter citrus and would mask the alcohol warmth even better. But I still love the appearance and smell, and the taste is very nice for a DIPA, really nice mouthfeel too, carb is perfect. I definitely recommend this, especially if you can get your hands on a fresh bomber - enjoy!"

"Pours a coppery orange with a white head. A floral and piney aroma sitting on top of a hefty malt base. Flavor follows suits. A fuller, kinda syrupy mouthfeel to this. Overall, can't say I was a fan of this one at all. I prefer my IIPA's to be fruity, this one seemed to be lacking in that completely."

"*At $10 a bottle, I don't know how many more times I'll be having this beer. But in general, this a very good beer. I was nervous trying a 102 IBU beer, but there is so much malt and alcohol warmth that the hop bitterness isn't all that harsh. A beer for me!"

""
""
"Beautiful copper color with a creamy head. Foam of the head clung to the side of the glass as the contents slowly disappeared. There is aromas of oranges, grapefruit, lemons, pine, and fresh cut herbs or grasses. The taste is very floral and the sweetness mellows out the sharpness of the hops. A top shelf hop head brew, great to share with a friend. The alcohol on this one will warm you up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- one my favorites IIPAs"
""
"Nice golden, frothy appearance. Nose has strong grapefruit, apple notes with a not-so-subtle hoppiness. Very smooth and balanced, with a sweetness not generally found in most imperial IPAs. Not my all-time favorite IIPA, but very underrated considering the quality."

"As a whole, this is an excellent Imperial IPA, and while the hops and bitterness are most certainly present in strong enough quantities that anyone not already familiar with 100+ IBU beers should drink with caution, for the well-acquainted this will prove a taste fest nonpareil. Highly recommended."
"Overall, very hop dominant dipa. Even with the high alcohol content, the malt is subdued, allowing the hops to shine."

"overall - superb DIPA. I like the well integrated hop flavors and malt balance."

"O- This is a super sweet DIPA that also has quite a bit of bitterness. Big, boozy, and sweet, which i usually do not like but it works here pretty well. The beer this most reminds me of is Unearthly, I think this is a bigger, boozier beer than that, but both are very sweet candy-like DIPAs."
"O: A very nice IPA (double), one of the better I've had. Yum. Share with a friend, high alcohol (10.4) for this 2011-12 release #15 from Avery."
""
""
""
""
"This beer has great flavor. There is great balance between the malt and hop characters. It's high ABV makes it a sipper, but the alcohol is well covered making this dangerously drinkable. I will definitely have this again."

"O- Although I know did not acquire the freshest bottle, I'm very happy to have had a chance to sample and review this highly regarded beer. Although the hype is well deserved (this is one damn good hop lovers dream), there are other examples in the market that are just as delectable on the palate. If you can get, get it...but don't get into a fight to acquire one."

"Good head retention for a high-booze beer, and great lacing on the glass. Bright bronze color is fairly translucent. Nose is unsurprisingly hoppy, fairly floral, a little bit of booze. Taste is very rich with tons and tons of hop bitterness and not so much hop flavor. The good news here is that it allows the beer to present a focus of balance between the bitter and the sweet, which it accomplishes fairly well while also hiding its alcohol for the most part. Nice dry finish. The body is great, medium to heavy, and it isn't too sticky or viscious, however, carbonation could definitely be bumped up. All in all, an absolute keeper, but not in my personal hall of fame. Could definitely see where it would make it into someone else's though."

""
""
""

"O - This one really pleased me. Just like the brewers intended, this is a very hop-forward beer: intense, juicy yet very drinkable! I personally love these more-fruity and juicy Imperial IPAs, so this was right up my alley, so to say! Highly recommended and well worth the $9+tx I paid for it!"

"A super solid big IPA, yet I wasn't super blown away like some beertubers seem to be. I did drink it fairly quickly for such a high abv DIPA in a bomber. I could have used more in the flava department though."
""
""
"On draft in a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy copper. One finger head with great lacing. Aroma is pine and citrus with a toffeeish touch. Flavor is citrus. Pineapple, apricot, and grapefruit with a caramel malt. Mouthfeel is syrupy and on the thick side. Really good DIPA"
""
"I tasted the 15 first and it is resinous, boozy, grassy and prickly and drying to the pallete. The taste sticks in your mouth for a while after the fist sip, and the boozy finishes sticks with you as well, but is not at all offensive. The batch of fourteen is danker, and heavier in taste. The dankness and burnt caramel flavors shine through, but does not have the piney grassy finish that the 15 did. The fourteen was prickly and drying as well, but not so much as the fresher batch 15 was. I am suprised that I like the older bottle a little better than the fresher one. Overall I enjoyed both bottles and would purchase this beer again. Good job Avery brewing company. Edit: Upon a second pour after the beer had warmed a bit it holds a head quit nicely and has now warmed to the point that resinous piney hops are shining through, coating my entire mouth and destroying my ability to taste. The fifteen is now drinking like the hop bomb it should. That'll learn me for reviewing too cold a beer. Thanks Avery Brewing Company."
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of a DIPA, the flavor was pretty damn intense, I have no problem classifying this as a palate wrecker. This beer doesn't have that good of drinkability, the bomber was a little too much for me to handle, I am sure I can drink it all but I think this beer is much better suited to be split with somebody that likes DIPA's, but I always finish what I start so this bad boy is going down. What I like most about this beer was the way it looked and the heavy grapefruit aroma, they were both pretty damn good. What I liked least about this beer was that it was a little rough around the edges, if the body was a little smoother and if the flavors blended a little better this would be a very good DIPA. If I wanted to get a palate wrecking DIPA for a decent price to split with somebody I may be inclined to purchase this again, but I think I would rather have Hop Stoopid, instead and it's cheaper. If you are a fan of DIPA and want something that is going to wreck your palate this beer is for you. This is one solid DIPA, but it isn't refined enough to be a top tier DIPA, I like it but there are more then a few DIPA's that I would rather have. Avery is one solid brewery, I haven't had anything from them that I would consider less then good, but I have yet to be truly wowed by their big beers, lucky for me they make a bunch of big beers so they have more then a couple chances to wow me with some of them and you can be sure I will buy them if they make it to a store near me, solid beer, keep up the good work guys, Avery is my favorite Colorado Brewery, they aren't afraid to take chances and I like that, I don't like a boring and very predictable brewery, Avery is not one of those."

"Pour is daeep amber with a decent white head. No carbonation, as usual. I get a balance of pine and citrus, but the smoke in the biergarten is messing with me. hm pine, all pine. Powdery sweet malt, with the pine losing to the sweetness of the malt. After hopslam and hop notch, this is kind of second best."
""
""
""
"A smooth, malty, piney DIPA. Nicely balanced, with solid hop and malt presence. Good, but not outstanding."
""
""
"Solid, but, unfortunately, not the exceptional experience others report. Big malt body, appropirate for an imperial IPA, with a caramel malt character. Assertive hopping, a bit raw and rough around the edges - moderately citric. ETOH bites at the finish a bit more than the ABV would seem to justify, with black pepper and some heat. Overall, a very good beer, but not more than that."

"O: A really decent DIPA that lacks another taste profile to take into top tier contention. Definitely worth a try and buy."

"O: As far as Doubles go this is a really nice beer. Defiantly a sipper, but overall I was very impressed. Would seek out again."

""

"Pours a deep pumpkin orange with a finger of steady off-white head. Almost zero beading. The nose hosts plenty of west coast style IIPA notes plus a slew of Chinook-like herbal, almost garlic presence. Not oniony or unpleasant (like Green Flash's Imperial... save that for another review) - it's just a bit more earthy than a traditional west coast IIPA, it's a nice change of pace. The taste is balanced but still aggressive. I don't know what hops are at play here but, to me, every hop highlight has its place in this beer - herbal, spicy, floral, citrus, spruce. A part of me wishes that this beer would take a direction of its own, but most of me is enjoying the hell out of it as it is."
"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear orange amber. One finger head with lacing, looks nice. Moderate hop aroma with hints of grapefruit and malt. Taste is hop forward at the start and middle, with a nice sweet malt base. Hops are not as aromatic as other top DIPAs, but are pleasant and distinctive. After the hops and malt subside, an odd bitter almost dry-sour finish that detracts a bit from the overall impression. Quite boozy and warming. Medium bodied Except for the slight off-taste on the finish, a very nice DIPA experience. I would certainly buy this again."
""
""
"Pours a clear honey brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Huge foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest and herbal hops, honey, and malt. Taste is of citrus zest and herbal hops up front with a nice honey, brown sugar, and malt finish. There is a medium bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good DIPA with a very nice balance in both the aromas and flavors."

"The Maharaja is an excellent. My review of it isn't, this is the last time I review abeer on my phone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was excited to try this one. I was selling for $9 by me and to be honest with you I feel that its money well spent and I would constantly pick this up on the regular if it stayed available."
"MF - Thick and sticky with good carbonation to prevent this from being cloying. Somehow they manage to take this big body and make it almost refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Copper amber hue with a frothy tan colored head. Citrus, fresh hops and caramel malts. Big earthy and floral aroma with hints of pine and lemongrass. Rich dry hops and smooth fruity textures on the initial sip. Lingering carbonation with sugared citrus fruits and smooth malts compose the body. Hints of honey and caramel follow into a hoppy aftertaste. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. A near perfect double IPA."
""
"O- not that impressed with this beer, too malty not enough hop aroma. Maybe I got an old bottle. I'll have to give it another try at some point if I can get a bottle."
"O: Overall, this is an alright beer. Probably wouldn't buy again or recommend it. Just average."
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice copper amberish with a nice tall white head that sticks around. Has a very nice citrus aroma that is very inviting. Tastes of sweet citrusy hops with a surprise amount of light malt that makes for a great taste. For a big beer, this is extremely drinkable and goes down perfectly. Overall a very fine DIPA. One that is a great beer I wish was around all year long."

"A big hopbomb, I've had this several times and never taken the time to review. I can't remember a beer that had a bigger disconnect between the nose and the palate. But if you're in the need for a hop-fix, you could do a lot worse."
"This is a very big beer! This is a must sipper. If you are a huge hophead, like myself, you still might find this is a little too hop forward. I've had beers claiming to be well over a 100 IBU's and this clocks in at a 103; yet, this brew is nothing but hops with some sweetness to back it up. I am not complaining at all - but beware!"
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic DIPA. The hops mix with the citrus very well, does not leave a huge bitterness even at over 100 IBUs, so rich and creamy its like a stout without the cloying thickness."
""
""
"Hazy orange with a snowy white head, good retention and lace. Highly aromatic, tropical fruit hops and caramel. Tons of citrus, orange, pineapple, grapefruit. Pine and sweet caramel malt. Very well balanced while still packing a formidable hop punch. Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation, sticky and creamy mouthfeel, well hidden alcohol. Bitterness comes out in a big way in the finish. A powerful, top-notch DIPA on the sweeter, maltier side. Definitely not in keeping with the drier west coast examples."
"Overall. i think this is a classic that needs to be put to rest or tweaked into a better version of the style. Less Pine, Less Malt, More Tropical Fruit and a cleaner finish."
""
"O: This beer may not be the tastiest imperial IPA I've ever had, but the flavors are super intense. I'm also really amazed at how well the malt holds up to all the hop flavors, as well as how well the two play off each other. Outstanding beer. The best I've had from Avery thus far."
"Thank you brothers"
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is great, I've had several on more than one occasion. It's so drinkable for the %, kinda dangerous."
""
"Overall: pretty good IPA. Would have again."

"M- Like I said, surprisingly easy to drink. Aftertaste is bitter there's a decent hop aftertaste and some pleasant hoppy burps after a while. This is a very enjoyable and well priced brew (8$). This beer is worthy of being my 100th review on BA, cheers to The Maharaja and to a 100 more reviews."
""
""
""
"But, still, for an $8 bomber, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Amazing beer. Malted and hopped and big. Super-sweet semi-tropical citrus aroma. Refreshing yet sticky and filling. Full, pineapple-juicy body with a robust malt and a mixed molasses/slight cherry-like sweetness. I don't know if I'd call this a DIPA, the malt is so big -so are the hop, though. Reminds me of some of Dogfish Head's bigger IPAs. Top quality Ale. Couldn't dare drink more than a bomber."
""
"O: Very good and very enjoyable - a little too intense to be considered sessionable or even a very regular beer in the rotation. I enjoy the tropical hoppy nature of the beer but feel like I need to pair it with some intense flavored food (spicy or aromatic)."
"O- a great dipa, a bit on the sweet side, but great taste, deffinatly worth drinking."
""
""
"I would repeat buy this if I was in the mood for an sweeter, intensely hoppy DIPA with a nice malty, caramel grain character. Despite being super hopped, it's not too bitter. If I could change anything here for my palate then it would be to add or keep the same level of bitterness, lighten the body while increasing drinkability, and reduce the caramel sweetness."
""
"O: I love the hop blend and the mouthfeel for this beer. A little too much alcohal and caramel for my liking. While this beer is very hoppy, the hops can't fully unleash their glory because the prevalent alcohol and sharp caramel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid DIPA, but the grainy malts and heavy traits detracted a bit from the overall rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't think it lives up to the hype but its good."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this beer is awesome. I would recommend it pretty much to anyone who loves hops, IPA's IIPA's...you get the idea. It's a very complete beer."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle pours a deep orange color with small white head. Aroma of big grapefruit notes, some pine, huge bready malts, toffee, biscuits, caramel. Flavor follows with the huge bitter grapefruit up front that fades into a soothing smooth bready malt character. Sweet for sure, and heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Very slick. Excellent brew, and on the malty side for the style."
""
""
""
""
"A decent DIPA, though a bit spendy for what it is, in my opinion."
"Notes: This is a very easy beer to drink, especially considering its strength. Barely a trace of alcohol despite its brawn (just over 10% abv). A quality beer and a good buy at $9 a bomber."
"The pour yielded a much darker-than-expected ruby garnet. Clear of haze, but very dark. A thin sheet of lace caps it off. Great nose bursting with candied hops, tangerine, orange slices, grapefruit. Awesome. Flavor is floral and well rounded with plenty of citrus as well. Bitter grapefruit, sweet tangerine, pineapple. The bitterness spikes at times, but gives way to a sweet candy-like finish. Loved it. Excellent beer that hit the spot, and one I will revisit again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm definitely a fan of this beer. It's big on the tropical citrus hops and that tends to be what I look for in a DIPA. Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm torn with this one. As the beer warms it becomes more complex, but I'm a bit scared to fully embrace it. Overall, a solid offering from Avery."
""
""
"I am glad we opened this because that bottle has been starring at me for a long time! I like it… a lot. Bottoms up people!"
""
""

"Overall a nice combination, not too strong, yet full of body."

"Release #15, Winter 2011/2012. In the glass the Maharaja was caramel in color, but did show a ruby glow if held up to the light. This is a cloudy beer, with particles of sediment circulating amidst the carbonation. Topped with a beautiful head, artistic larger bubbles arranged in a sea of fine foam, the Maharaja is a joy to behold. The aroma holds up its end with a nice mix of hop spice tones and sweet malt notes. The only way to describe the flavor is balance. Many IPA’s start out with malt and then the hops kick in at the finish. With the Maharaja, the malt and the hops work together throughout the experience. There is lots of complexity, and many flavors, but all work well together. The warmth of the alcohol is noticeable, and the aftertaste has a touch of bitter. So yes, this is exceptional ale, but there are a few signature four packs of Double IPAs that are in the same league."
""

"The hoppy aftertaste really develops slowly, and continues to evolve for minutes after I've sipped. Very intriguing stuff."

"Given the abv, I'd say this is a deceptively delicious brew that is highly sessionable. A must try."
"It pours amber, and it has bubbles, and it's pretty to look at being all amber and everything. But it's about the pineapples!!"

"This is a golden blonde colored beer. As fitting a DIPA the defining characteristic is the piney hops, found in abundance on both the aroma and flavor. The piney flavor comes through with a thick, resiny, chewy finish. This is a big one for those who like thick beers."
""
"O- This brew is true to its reputation. One of the best IPA's I have ever had. Pliney the Elder is the only one that stands out as superior (although hardly so!). Highly recommended for any enthusiast."

"O: This is a very solid DIPA. It is far from my favorite, but it does have a lot of great qualities."
""
""
"True to it's name, this beer is a """Great King""". Weighing in at a heft 10.39% ABV and whopping 102 IBU's, Maharaja from Avery Brewing Company in Boulder, CO pours a hazy orange-amber color, featuring a slightly off-white head that provides a great deal of lacing throughout. A BIG citrus hop nose mingles with bready malt notes as well as occasional whiffs of piney and resiny hop aromas. The flavor of this brew stays close to the aromas we picked up on, with faintly toasted malt flavors blending beautifully with the citrusy hop characteristics before finishing with a smooth and well balanced finish. Maharaja shows a medium body with a tongue-prickling carbonation. Another in the great Dictator Series from Avery."
""
""
"This brew is world class and maybe the best example I have had for the style. It is so damn good all around and I would session this stuff until I feel asleep. I am torn when giving a perfect score, but man this brew is just that good. For me you cant do much better in terms of looks, nose, taste and feel. Tremendous."
""
""

" drinkable, just not my favorite."

"T: Huge sticky citrus hops with a big dose of caramel and a touch of mango. Tons of hop resin on the finish. Tasty stuff here."

"I must say, this is the best double IPA I have tried, and I have been sampling quite a few of late. Definitely seek it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
""

"In the meantime, I'll enjoy being part of the cult following of this tasty brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A cruel, domineering beer with big, aggressive flavors. This bottle was a bit old and the hops seem to have gone a bit down that tea route, but its still a tasty beer, I'll have to try this again if I can ever find a fresh bottle."
"D - It's not bad, but it's not good. Just an average offering in my book. I appreciate the freshness of the hops, but it's entirely unbalanced."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was how well it aged. This was utterly surprising that the hops stayed so strong after almost three years, while the booze didn’t entirely take over everything with the malts. The hops held up astonishingly well, offering a great balance with the malts, making for a clean and thorough DIPA."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a wide-mouthed wine glass (which in retrospect may not have been the best choice). It has a murky golden color with a little barely visible effervescence. In this glass it has very little head and minimal retention and lacing but that would probably be different in a pint or a tulip. The odor is not particularly appealing but not bad- it smells of piney hops and also has a similar odor to hop-trub (the remains of hops after they've been boiled before fermentation). The taste is a constant barrage of hops- piney, citrusy, and overall pretty bitter. Has a nice long finish. The mouthfeel is perfectly appropriate- a little oily with good solid carbonation. A fine example of an Imperial IPA ."

"Overall I would compare this beer to 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish. It has a huge body and alot of malt and sweet hop character. I really like this beer and it shows the great contrast of DIPA and Imperial IPA...this I would say is an Imperial IPA. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall; a solid brew but nothing that really stands out to me.. Definitely not an unpleasant brew by any stretch but unfortunately a bit unremarkable... Perhaps a more fresh bottle would alleviate my feelings and I will certainly keep my eyes peeled for a fresh one next year and revisit when appropriate!"

"This is definitely the hoppiest beer I've ever had. It poured a cloudy copper orange color with a pillowed white head. It had the scent of bitter hops. The taste was hops and more hops. It started out bold with sweet tasting hops and gradually worked to finish bitter and dry. Definitely a full, long lasting tasteful beer. If you are not a fan on hoppy beers, definitely one to avoid, but I really liked it!"

"Overall a delicious beer. Balances everything really well. You only feel the alcohol after you've drunk it- it remains extremely drinkable and well-balanced. The dry-hopping really gives it a luscious quality. Dangerous."
"Overall, I love Maha, bow to him."
"This is a great example of the DIPA style and has so much to offer for a hop head. I'm not a hop head, but I totally appreciate the way everything is pulled together and think this should be a good benchmark for any brewer looking to create a solid DIPA."
"This bottle was not as fresh as I would like. A DIPA I would love to revist."
"O - I have had this before, fresher, and really enjoyed it. This doesn't seem to be an IPA that takes too well a 1 or 2 months of holding onto. Still really good, just not as I remember it before."
"pretty damn good avery! pours a dank reddish color with a thick white head on er. smells incredible, sticky hops and booze. genuinely would wear this as cologne! taste is complex for an imperial ipa. more than just that hop smack, its got a lot of fruity stuff happening, some lemon or orange in there as an acidic and complementary thing. there is also a sort of earthy naturalness to it, a purity. mouthfeel is perfect to, chewy thick hops with a bright carbonated finish. this one is a keeper"
"O- Really glad that this is available to me now! Really wished I picked up more than just one, but at $9.49/22oz... not exactally wallet friendly. This is really fantastic though and I will definately be grabbing more when the IPA bug bites!"
"Pretty smooth, light to medium in body...again, pretty darn drinkable for a 2x IPA. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one, but if I had to drink a double IPA...this would be it."
"The aroma isn't in your face, but don't worry. What this beer lacks in bouquet it more than makes up for in taste. Tastes so hoppy and malty. I love it. Definitly worthy of the name Imperial IPA. Very smooth with pine up front and malty finish. Creamy mouthfeel. So delicious. 102 IBUs/10% abv equals one hell of a good beer."
"O: great brew! Drinks smoother than dfh 90 minute with the same character and nice hop notes, lived up to my expectations and I really wish I could get this more often. Great offering"
"Overall Drinkability - Good beer, but for the style, thoroughly unimpressive."
"Intense grapefruit and light grass hops aroma with a light malt hints to the aroma. Appearance is lightly cloudy amber brown body with a frothy head that dissipates slowly. Taste is a pleasantly bitter and resinous hops with a sweet hint of malt to round it out. Light carbonation with long finish. Overall an amazing creation from Avery!"
"This was an unexpected bonus in my trade and I'm super glad it was shipped to me. This is exactly the type of IPA I enjoy with strong aromatics and a rich, dark base. I haven't had much exposure to Avery, but this is definitely a good start!"
"I guess this beer really varies batch to batch. I wasn't really impressed by it. Maharaja certainly isn't a bad DIPA, but it's kind of the opposite of what I look for in the style. It's too malty to be balanced, too much booze, not crisp."
"Overall: Not a bad beer but not really all that impressed with this one"
"Split a 22oz bomber. This one was highly recommended by local spirits store. Certainly a high quality craft brew, but this one was too big of a beer for me. Lots of complex tastes and subtle punch but just not something I could drink/enjoy beyond a taster. If big imperial IPA's are your favored, you probably will enjoy this one as reviews are very high. Back to regular IPAs for me."
"O: Delicious. 4.5"
"Overall - Maybe not the typical DIPA that screams in your face with all american """C"" hops, this is a complex and unique beer I'm glad to have tried. The extensive cellared/shelved age of this bottle likely softened much of the upfront hop aromas and bitterness (as judged by other reviewers comments). However, as a fan of barleywines as well, I really enjoy how this beer seemingly weaves in and out of the DIPA/barleywine boundaries."
"My local shop owner kept telling me to try it so I did. It poured very smooth and as I poured it It smelled like a grapefruit but not overpowering in the smell. The beer settled into a very rich and deep amber color with a small off white foam head that didn't stick around more than a minute. The beer taste like a tangerine infused with a bitter grapefruit and left my mouth feeling moist and refreshed. I enjoyed it and allowed it to get warm and it was still a delicious beer."
"Pours a translucent, cloudy orangish-gold, with a half finger's crown at the top. The nose on this is stellar. Right up my alley. Heavy citrus...flat out grapefruit dominated. Some caramel and malty notes blend in. The taste is a winner too. All the aromas come out to play on the palate. This beer tastes like it smells. The caramel and malt notes are more pronounced, especially upon the finish. The mouthfeel lets you know they weren't fuckin' around with this. It's boozy. It doesn't necessarily taste 10.46 ABV, but you know it's packin'. For being an 102 IBU beer, I don't get the bitterness or hoppiness I'd expect from the number. Overall this is a tasty beverage. I'll seek this out again."
"Overall, it didnt quite make my top 5, but it was a very good beer and I definitely could drink it again. Very complex, drinkable, well-crafted brew. The malt presence could be dialed down some, but it still gets a thumbs up from me."
" Overall Badass IIPA! Very well brewed I gonna say In my top five for the catagory. I need more."
"O: a favorite of mIne since I had it a few years ago at Toronado SD"
"One of the most complex dIPAs I've ever had. So many layers or waves of flavor that it takes a while to sift through. An intense and enjoyable drinking experience."
"Pours a beautifully clear dark copper with a one and a half creamy head. The aroma is bizarre. It smells like mango cereal. The cereal graininess is very off-putting to me and I don't get much of a hop aroma at all. The taste is nothing like the smell. I get tons of mango and papaya. The graininess is nowhere in the taste. This ale is pretty sweet, but insanely bitter at the same time. In a weird way this beer is balanced. Overall a good experience. I don't know what's up with the aroma, but the taste is well worth it. DuganA is much better and drinkable IMHO. A nice DIPA and I may enjoy this better fresh."
"Not as good as I thought it would be. Was a bit surprised when I saw the good reviews on Beer Advocate after I had already reviewed it."
"Strong aroma is very hoppy, nearly evergreen, with a firm citrus underpinning that is mainly grapefruit with some sour orange. It pours a beautiful clear coppery brown with a thick and fluffy pale copper head. Scrumptious and highly pleasing hoppy flavor has tones of grapefruit, orange and caramel, with a hint of sweetness that perfectly balances the hoppy bitterness. Full-bodied texture is quite fizzy and lively, leaving a lip-smacking tingly, hoppy, slightly sweet finish. Strongly recommended to all IPA fanatics."
"O- Great DIPA! One of my favorites and one I should enjoy more over the summer. Can't wait for fresh batches next year."
"Overall pretty good, but not my favorite. For $7.29-not bad at all."
"O: Lots of off flavors, really missed the mark in my book. The taste is literally sweet and salty, hops bring little to the table. This beer is 3 months old not 3 years old....not buying that it would be much better if it were brewed last week."
"Overall: This beer is suppose to be better than a Pliny the Elder. I had this side by side with a PTE and it is certainly not as good as a Pliny!! It is boozier and a lot more cloying but it’s nowhere as good! For anyone who disagrees he or she should try it this way. I’m just giving my honest opinion. Good beer though."
"Reading other reviews, perhaps I had a bad bottle. To me, this was not an enjoyable IIPA. It was bordering on nasty."
"Not a bad DIPA here. Perhaps not among my absolute favorites, but it's quite an asskicker and will fit the bill for anybody who wants a DIPA with a high hop kick and quite a sweet malt profile."
"Its been a couple of years since I had this beer. From what I remember it had a nice and hoppy nose to it but this one just smelled off. The place I had it at just got there power back and I am wondering if this had an affect on its smell. I am going to try and get a bottle of this to see if it still smells the same. Still can't get over the plastic smell."
"Overall: this is a damn tasty beer. Why did I wait so long before trying it?"
"Overall--what more can be said?"
"Overall - Good bang-for-your-buck DIPA when you can find it. Definitely give it a shot if you have the chance, but I doubt it will become your go-to daily drinker."
"This one might have been passed its prime ( about 2 months old), but still is extremely tasty! This is one of my favorite DIPAs."
"O- A decent IIPA, but there are several better out there. A bit too sweet and it could use more hops on the nose. Good but not spectacular."
"This is an awesome double ipa. I can't get enough of the might maharaja but I'll probably limit myself to two tonight. If it wasn't a school night I would take down the entire growler."
"D: The Maharaja commands respect. A sipping beer that's so good you'll want to drink it too quickly."
"O: Very, very well rounded and balanced brew. Right up there with my favorite DIPAs."
"O - This is a great DIPA. The alcohol is extremely subtle for being +10%! Not over aggressively hopped, but just enough to spice up the malts. Beautiful flavor balance!"
"22 oz. bottle, poured into tulip glass"
"95."
"Solid DIPA, one I would like to try super fresh."
"O: This beer is definitely a sipper given its strength. However, it’s not all that difficult to drink because only hints of alcohol are noticeable in the taste."
"Overall I really like this batch, the batch 12 was a disappointment with 13 getting better. !4 is worth grabbing and drinking."
"O: This is a very, very nice drinking experience. If this were available in my area, I’d be drinking it all the time. Full-bodied yet drinkable is all that I love in an Imperial IPA – I just get tired of those ultra-syrupy malt-bombs before I even finish the bottle. Fortunately, this is not that. Very worthy of its spot in the Beers of Fame."
"After several mediocre DIPAs, this was finally something I could drink again. Exotic mouthfeel with a full range of hop flavors and that curious sweetness on the palate that tasted seriously like orange sherbet or if you made a puree of overripe papaya. It definitely provided the right balance though for this ridiculously big and bitter brew."
"D - Nice drinkability for such a high ABV. Everything is great about this beer. Excellent example of the style. I will be searching for this in bottle form."
"O - This is a really nice beer. You can't have too many of these because of the combination of the bitterness and alcohol. But having a glass is really really enjoyable."
"O- Great beer from the look to the smell and the taste matches the smell...sweet toffee malt and hop bitterness...different from some of the other dipa i have had recently and it certainly a class beer and love to try this fresh"
"O: Nice, easy to drink DIPA. I will buy this again."
"O - This is a pretty darn good IPA, but as weird as it sounds I would like to see more bitter hop prominence (it is claimed to be 102 IBU, after all). The unbalance between hop and malt is what makes imperial IPA's so great, and this one is almost a bit cloyingly sweet in the malt department which tends to dominate the flavor profile. It lacks that bready backbone that complements many imperial IPA's so well."
"Overall, this is one of the BEST IIPA's I've ever had. You won't regret searching this one out and picking up a few bottles, a must try, IMO. Very underrated Imperial Pale Ale right here."
"Batch 14, June 2011. Been looking forward to trying this bad boy. Poured a deep amber color with two finger head that hung around the entire beer. Very malty and hoppy. Similiar to 90 min, but not as good in my opinion. Maybe cuz it's not ultra fresh, but not as good as I expected although I had set my expectations high. Overall I'd drink again but not go out of my way to get."
"O - Overall, this is a very good DIPA. It's got a few months on it and it's a hop bomb right now and I'm sure it's even more so fresh."
"Giving this one a solid """A"". Thinking of exploring more Avery Brewing Company IPAs."
"OA: Fantastic brew that I'm glad to have finally tried."
"O- hop head's delight, plain and simple. An awesome DIPA, respect the Maharaja."
"O - I still can't quite figure this one out. I want to like it, but there's something about the finish that is too barleywine for me. I hope it's just a case of the hops fading over the couple months since bottling, but I'll just have to revisit and find out for myself another time!"
"Overall I like it. Alcohol is not perceived terribly, and the acidity isn't as impactful on me as something like Double Jack was. A damn good beer."
"Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"ABV: 10.46%"
"D: great showcase of a tasteful malt body as well as american hops. kind of surprised of how drinkable this big bodied brew is considering the alcohol, but it is hardly noticeable."
"Batch 14, June 2011."
"O- very good. I would recommend this beer."
"O Was more impressed with the nose than I was the taste. But I would definitely pick this up again. Solid beer."
"O: very tasty and boozy as I'm starting to get a buzz already lol. Def want to age one of these. Try one for yourself!"
"One of my personal favorites."
"O: Really nice, gives hopslam a run for its money for sure."
"O- A fine brew. Wish I had more of this. My bottle was very fresh so hop flavors were ideal and the bitterness of this was not so overwhelming that it became unbalanced."
"Perilously close to a booze-bomb. There's no obvious reason why this needs its 10.3%, given the hop profile is not particularly complex or challenging. Would be a very nice beer at 8-9%."
"This is a good beer for anybody that wants a serious beer with a serious punch. I would drink it again with a dinner or perhaps at a beer tasting party."
"not my style of DIPA. a bit too boozy and sweet for my liking. its very well brewed for what it is, just not what I look favor. will definitely drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to acquire it."
"O - Very complex beer. It took me a few sips to warm up to this one but I came to appreciate it. I don't love it but I can definitely see why it gets very high marks."
"Poured into 13oz tulip. A very clear copper, with a sticky white two inch head. Smell is very bold, grapefruit, breadeness, some orange, and some booze. Smell is all that, but even more intense. It lingers for some time. Big mouthfeel, enough carbonation given the Abv. This is the real deal. A large Imperial IPA that you can't forget."
"Overall, this one has a great nose. It's very enticing but the rest of the beer doesn't live up to the aroma. The alcohol is overwhelming at some points and provides a harsh finish at others."
"With this one and hop stoopid a couple of nights ago, I'm warming back up to the Imperial IPA style, normally I find them too sweet but this one is great even with the sweetness, this might be perhaps my favorite Imperial IPA (assuming that Runiation is a double IPA and slightly different). Great stuff."
"M - Thicker but refreshing. I almost would like a little bit more carbonation, but maybe that is just personal preference. I have had beers in the same style with a little bit better mouthfeel, but this one is definitely far from bad!"
"This is one of the better imperial IPAs I've had. I generally don't like the fruitier beers and even though this one is very fruity I liked it. It looks beautiful and taste great. Fruity, hoppy, spicy, sweet, and smooth. A great imperial IPA. Is this the """Great King""" of imperial IPAs? It just might be."
"O: I've had this many both on tap in bottle and now growler, this is in my top ten dipa/ipa's"
"O: A great beer, really loved it. Will be looking for this one wherever it can be found."
"cheersya"
"A strong contender for the best Imperial IPA available. The best thing about this beer is that as it warms up the hop bouquet really becomes more and more complex: wild, grassy, dare I say wild oniony/garlicky? Weird, I know, but somehow it works. Pineapple and syrup mix with honeyed grapefruit. A must have for any hophead."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. It does what it set out to do: conquer the senses. Well done."
"Overall this might be my favorite DIPA. It nicely balanced with a good nose and mouthfeel, and I don't feel like I'm pouring hop oil down my mouth when I drink it. A great beer I would not hesitate to drink again."
"O - Overall a delicious, complex brew. Plenty of flavors working together perfectly, but somewhat sticky in the feel. Amazing job of hiding the alcohol."
"Fantastic balanced DIPA. It has a great feel with no alcohol burn and only slight warming. A wonderful complex flavor though it could use a little more on alpha hops. This is a very easy drinking beer for such a big brew."
"O: Seriously, to all those in the Avery market, if you haven't tried this beer, or you love HopSlam, Pliny, Sculpin, Hop Stoopid, then pick this up, you won't be disappointed."
"This is one bold, balls-out DIPA. I'm more impressed with Batch 14 then what I remember about Batch 13, which seemed somewhat more malt-forward. They dumped a hell of a lot of malt and a hell of a lot of hops into this brew."
"O: I had a growler of it I was done after half. Just to much of a good thing. Very good in small doses."
"Overall: I enjoyed the balance of the hops and the malt. I enjoyed the fruity notes. I'm not sure how fresh this was, but I thought it was quite good."
"This a malty hoppy monster. A bit more malty than hoppy, and at over 100 ibus that is a lot of malt. Cracked this open after a long day of work on a chair in my backyard...it's really complex, I am just figuring it out. This one starts off sweet, but finishes bitter - like a woman. it has a really nice bitter core surrounded caramel and toffee malts and hops that I would call earthy rather than citrusy. Clever name, king of IPA's..."
"Prosit!!"
"Taste is another story. Very pine, spice and orange peel. Alcohol warms the finish. There is a big dose of malt in this one as well and it is fairly sweet. I personally like the malt to balance out this strong hop character. I find this to be a truly great example of the DIPA and what I like."
"Overall a representation of a DIPA. Hop character is still there even though the bottle I had was three months old. Alcohol is a little too evident but overall I would drink this again."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, mango and grapefruity hops. In the taste, a dry grapefruit like hop and a small alcohol like burn. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry grapefruit rind aftertaste. Sweet aroma, and dry taste, with big hops and a nice presence of alcohol."
"Overall, this doesn't match up to many other versions of the style. Its not that complex and is very boozy."
"D-Overall i was exspecting this to be a faded DIPA b/c i estimated this bottle to be abot 4 weeks old. But it was toatly the opposite. The hops and grapefruit flavor were way to much for me to enjoy this beer. glad i was sharing this with a friend or i would of drain poured the rest. Its not a bad beer by any means. Its just that anything with a big grapefruit taste i tend to stay away from. Glad i tried it and i reccomend everyone try it but it just wasn't doing it for me."
"This beer pours a dark orange with some floaties color and a thick fluffy off white head that lasts. the smell is grapefruit and pine with a hint of malt sweetness. the flavor is piney and citrus as is followed b an intensely bitter finish. there is also some residual sweetness that adds to a medium body and the only thing that takes away form the beer. overall a really good beer, just a little to thick"
"Overly sweet for this style. A bit cloying, sticky and but interesting and descent DIPA. A big sipper that goes crazy on spicy hops as it warms."
"This beer pours pours a dark copper color with a litt bit of jead that laced. The smell is infused with hops and is bitter. The taste the is very bitter; very hoppy. Strong flavor stays on the palletee. Overall fanstastic, strong flavor very hoppy, strong flavor."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This is an interesting beer for sure and I'm almost glad it's not a proto-typical DIPA. I think the thickness and sweetness is something that Avery does well to include in this beer. I'm sure it's exaggerated with some of the age on this, so I'd love to try it fresh, but as it stands now it is a unique beer that sort of shatters some preconceived notions I had coming into it."
"O: Well-balanced hoppy bitterness and sweet malt, alcohol not very well hidden, but stilll very drinkable and enjoyable"
"Overall: A perfect IPA. This brew has all of the great IPA flavor with lots of unique melon characteristics I have never experienced in a beer of this style. Try it NOW!"
"O - Well worth the hype. Great all the way around."
"4.5/4.5/4/4/4"
"I <3 Avery"
"A good IIPA. A bit overrated in my book,but I would really like to try this again fresh. The bottle I had was bottled in March it is now June."
"Overall I thought it was a """good""" beer but unlike the other years I have had a was disapointed with the lack of hops, I love the sweetness but I thought it would be better with more hops in taste."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. This brew comes across to me a bit much like spoiled fruit meets young yeast as I partake in the rest of my serving. The abv is hidden quite well though if that helps matters at all."
"Complex offering...many layers to think about as you drink. The alcohol is present, and you sure can taste it. I imagine this would turn into a fine barleywine with some age..."
"Overall: Impressive double IPA, not overwhelmingly bitter, and complex enough to have you coming back for more."
"O- much sweeter than expecting. Typically like more hop heavy iipa's so this one wasn't my favorite. Still a good drink, just not my kind in this style."
"Overall I was impressed with this. On par with most DIPA's being more malt forward this ones got a pair with a strong hoppy finish that masks the ABV. Dangerously drinkable and for only 9 dollar a bottle for such a """limited""" release I will try to grab another before the rest are gone. Good Stuff."
"Atmospher is great. Really solid appearance featuring a golden amber body with very little carbonation (in the body which i like), with a great frothy head, and tons o' lacing. Nose is not complex, but a very full combination of hops and the sweetness of gingerbread (or something similar of the sort). Flavor is a slightly sweet, slightly bitter, slightly hoppy combinatio of raisin, pine, and grains. Very well done. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Overall - Reminded me quite a bit of Bell's Hopslam, but with an unpleasant bitter taste at the end. Despite that, I was pretty impressed with this beer. I enjoy the fact that they just didn't want to copy the Hopslam taste but try a little bit less hop bitterness at the end."
"I dont think I'd purchase another one so quickly but I'll gladly split one if you bring it over. :)"
"o-they did well with this beer again this year. Has a lot going on, and demands to be sipped. Nice layering of the flavors that gives the drinker a lot to think about while enjoying. Glad it's summer again!"
"O - This is a great double IPA. I'd like to sample more of this beer (only had 10oz) and/or have it out of a bottle as well before I would rank it in my favorite double IPAs, but I'm quite sure it's going to be high up there on the list."
"D: Delicious beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone, but due to the boozy feel, It is a sipping beer."
"Overall I was fairly impressed with this one. Avery's standard IPA I felt was a bit flat and left much to be desired. Not so here. The aroma alone is reason enough to love this beer. If I'm being honest and had to pick one thing that I didn't like, it would be the nearly syrupy mouthfeel. Other than that I feel Avery really knocked it out with this one."
"O: awesome dipa, very fresh, this one is up there with hopslam and double trouble"
"This beer pours a clean amber color with a finger of white foamy head that retains well and laces alright. The aroma is very strong with cascade and chinook hops... Very piney and citrusy. The tast starts malty sweet with a bit of citrusy hop flavor... Finishes slightly too bitter. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced. Overall a good double IPA."
"O - Unique, but enjoyable."
"WORLD CLASS; MUST HAVE!"
"The color was good, golden orange pouring into the glass. VERY fresh Aroma of hops! A Big Hop-Punch in the Face! At first there’s no doubt hops are present…Oh-Oh!! I’m just about midway and worried (hence, 10.54%!)!! VERY GOOD (4 out of five). But, One is enough!!!"
"O: A great beer on-tap -- make a point to give this a try at its freshest as it is a hop buffet."
"O: Unfortunately, the flavors cannot live up to the nice aromas of this beer. The nose promises a tropical citrus fruit blast and the flavor delivers a hot, thick, bitter mess. This beer is ~2 months old at this point, but it just showed up in my area and I'm of the opinion that the best DIPAs are still great even with a few months on them."
"Overall I find this thick, syrupy and it's even a bit boozy uneccesarily, and I can't get rid of this aftertaste which is just an unpleasant bitterness, and not even a pleasant hop bitter. I feel like I drank a stick of butter also which really isn't fun. Still can't get into this brew and I am never having this again, this isn't for me."
"Poured into a snifter, a clear copper orange in color with a small soapy head and some lacing on the glass. Aroma of floral hops, some dank, sweetness, alittle citrus. Big time bitterness and leafy hop flavors, also some honey like malt sweetness. Alcohol lofts in as well. Earthy , pine resin hops, sugary malt sweetness and some alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slick and chewey. Overall, a big friggin beer, and a hop beast."
"O- its a solid dipa but not my style. A touch heavy on the malts and lacking that bright fresh hopping that I hope for in a dipa."
"Overall- Phenomenal beer! The drinkability is weak (could only drink one of these in a day) but has such great characteristics and hits the Style right on that its still Good overall!"
"This is an excellent DIPA and my favorite offering from Avery. This one rounds out my Top 5 for the style. Very well done."
"One of my favorite Imperial IPA's, I can't recommend this beer enough. Drinkable as hell, bitter and tasty, a hop-bomb for all those hop-heads out there. Pick it up now!"
"O- Overall this was a solid brew but I was a little disappointed. I've heard that some batches are better than others. I might try it again in the future. Still a decent beer."
"I first had this on draft at the Avery brewery in April 2010, and have been an Avery fan ever since."
"overall, I think this is a very nice drinkable beer, which surprises me a tad because the bomber keeps telling me is 10.54 abv. Again, I am of the opinion that a IIPA/DIPA should be balanced with some malty backbone, not just a hop-bomb, so this beer suits me very nicely. Purchased for $8.50, so the price is right IMO. I havent tasted much else from Avery (hard to find in Wisconsin) but after tasting this, I would love to see what else this brewery can come up with."
"Overall: One of the better DIPA I've had. The tangy sweetness is almost too much but the malts balance things well. Very easy drinking."
"I'm no hophead, but I like to think I can recognize when hops are well done and I think I've found that here."
"Not as good as I was hoping but not bad by any means."
"D- Overall, an aggressive IIPA that lives up to its name. Very tasty, but a bomber is too much for one person IMO. If you don't have someone to share with, 22oz will last several hours unless you're in a celebratory mood."
"O: One of the best Imperial IPAs I've ever had. Period. It's not a super tropical-y, fruity DIPA (which I adore), rather it's more of a smooth and subdued creamy brew. Don't pass this one by"
"Overall this is a fantastic double IPA. I drink so many Cali hop bombs that it's really nice to drink a double IPA that also showcases its malt profile. Definitely seek this beer out."
"As soon as I poured this I got hit with the sweet smell of pineapple and was also very pleased with how this beer looked. I will buy more of this, just so long as I can find it."
"O - I'm enjoying this about as much as I did when I had it on draft in Boston. Avery Brewing Co. has simply created a standard-setting brew with the Maharaja Imperial IPA."
"Really nice double IPA, but not the most drinkable; the sharp booziness and sweetness slowed me down somewhat."
"O-I was really looking forward to this beer, because I love any type of IPA, but this thing seemed more like a high abv barleywine. I drank half the bomber and had to drain pour the rest. After looking at other BA's reviews it seems like I had a different beer."
"O - This is a huge aggressive double IPA, beautiful floral hop notes in the nose and mouth. It's very bright, alive and sensory. Its almost a palate killer. I'd buy this again and would imagine this is even more spectacular when it's super fresh."
"[Question to others and what I'm unaware of is if the strong taste of alcohol would increase with time, and if there are IPA"""s that can be slightly cellared? Also, is the degradation of aromatic compounds the melon or malty flavors I now detect? Or is this the actual purpose of the brew?]"
"Pours golden copper and crystal clear with no haze. The head is fluffy and white. A great looking beer. It smells sweet and citrusy with a little bit of booze smell. The taste is sweet up front with some hop blast in the back. It is smooth and easy to drink. Very pleasant beer and will drink again!"
"Lucky enough to find this. Orange gold color with fluffy white head that leaves traces on the pint glass. Huge aroma: oine and citrus. The taste is a very high end malt bill with intense pine and hop flavors, very bold and sharp. Finish is great.This beer is all it's cracked up to be from everyone else's review."
"Notes: This might be my favorite from Avery, a brewery that I have been tough on in the past for what I recall to be some average and even some below average (at least for a micro brewery) beers. This is certainly not one of those. Perspective is funny. I wonder if I had this one earlier on would my impression of Avery be more favorable overall? Anyway, I am really happy that I bought this one and I think that you will be as well."
"Amber gold color with busy white head that rocks and clumps all over the glass. Aromas are intense and hoppy, very piney and citrusy. Flavors are of orange, pineapple, intense pine and hop resin, very bold and sharp. Finish is rippingly bitter and fantastic. Solid beer, a little pricey, but gets the hop fix."
"Draft to snifter. Looks good, but more amber than most double IPAs. The bouquet is excellent. Hoppy with malt and alcohol notes. Tastes great as well; hoppy and warm. I like it on draft much better than the bombers, but that could be an artifact of freshness (or lack thereof). Mouthfeel is good too, but warm, as I mentioned. Overall, an excellent brew that I'll be having again."
"Note: Get this beer fresh. I grabbed a bottle from the brewery and also had one from a bottle shop...the difference was noticeable."
"Too hot and too sweet. Toned down it has the potential for a top 10 DIPA in my humble opinion."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is surprisingly thick for a DIPA. While it isn't exactly sticky, it definitely has a syrupy mouthfeel. A little more carbonation would have helped the drinkability considerably."
"O: I had very high expectation for this beer and that may be why I feel somewhat disappointed. This is 2 months old and may be past its prime. Too balanced for my ridiculous hoppy tastes."
"If you liked this beer, I suggest a """Gordons""" or now is called the """G'Knight""" from oskar blues brewing co. Very similar and also delicious."
"Cheers!"
"O: Delicious. This is easily one of the top ten to twenty DIPA's I've consumed. I'm stoked to have had this on tap, and even happier to know I've got a 64oz growler sitting in the fridge. A hearty recommendation from Rhettroactive."
"Taste - Sweet and boozy flavour with citrus and floral notes, strong caramel malt backbone. Nice bitter finish."
"Overall I thought this was a solid example of a DIPA and pretty well balanced. I expected it to have a much drier finish but was pleased with it. I really dig this one and I'm glad I have a few more bottles to enjoy."
"Narrative: """Place my equipage on the center rug and take care not to scuff the well adorned mahogany sides""" You work busily to comply with his requests but his bitter nature and biting commentary is almost too much. """A little something for your troubles.""" he presses a crisp $100 bill into your hand, for what? Bringing some cumbersome trunk to the front foyer? This is treatment you can handle, and somehow welcome. He walks and surveys the split landing of the threadbare banister. """THIS WILL NOT DO.""" running a finger lightly over the worn wood, he looks to you for approval, you somehow gain a sense of commoradery in his majesty, knowing the complexity in his thought and manner, here you just a vagrant chimney sweep moments ago, now bitterly at the receiving end of his jansenist nature. """What do you feel this is a vestibule for peregrine mendicants? obtain your composure and tend to the rest of my articles, as resolutely as I am sure you are capable.""" That was his way, you saw him cooly surverying the premises in his ivory suit, casuistically wiping the sweat from his brow in a manner that showed poise and decisiveness. The drying extraction of his remarks place you in a humble yet hopeful state, not unlike a teeball coach whom you welcome the reprimand if only for a dose of the gratifying approval. """Also, you...you take care of yourself...""" his eyes glint a flash of knowing understanding, as though he too had been one toiling with luggage and taking care not to scratch the italian marble, a harsh but culling master, your maharaja."
"O - Maharaja is advertised as a 2xipa tyhat will suck the enaml off your teeth i feel well i feel it meets the billing"
"Pours golden amber with a two-finger head, smells of caramel malt, pine/citrus hops. It's a sweet beer, but it's a really wonderful one: rich caramel malt, rich pine and citrus/mango hops, a smooth, silky, sipping mouthfeel. Booze and barley around the margins. Very well balanced overall. Maybe I'm in a good mood because I'm watching a good NHL game, but this beer is helping too. Would happily drink again."
"O - Maharaja is a great IIPA, but nothing I haven't tasted before in the style. Also, a little too thick, which takes away from the excellent hop flavors."
"Overall this is a great Imperial IPA. I liked the aroma a lot, but the flavors on the palate just didn't have a """wow""" factor. Not my favorite IIPA, but still very good."
"-Cheers"
"Pours a nice amber with perfect head, great lacing and good clarity. Smells incredible, smells a lot of grapes, not so much grapefruit but grapes and citrus. One of the best on the nose. Taste follows, however the 10% is very apparent and knocks my socks off. Feels great and overall this is a fantastic DIPA, however.. it should be shared"
"O - A very good double IPA full of fruity flavors! I like this one a lot and it deserves it's rightful place on the top 100."
"This is a pretty solid DIPA, and Avery does a remarkable job of covering up the high alcohol content. Maharaja packs a hugely bitter punch, but the flavor isn't quite as strong or complex as I'd like. Still, a very good beer, and definitely a go-to when I'm in the mood to have my tongue get kicked around a bit."
"O- Nice DIPA- Not quite in my favorites list for the category, but I would buy it again. Check it out!"
"O: Easily the best DIPA I've yet had. Intense tropical fruits/citrus with lots of depth and complexity. A huge malt base to help balance the pine resin and bitterness, and the perfect amount of sweetness to round it all out and bring out the juiciness of the hops. I can't even imagine Heady Topper, Ephriam, and Pliney the Younger being better than this. My head would explode if that's actually the case. I love this beer in the bottle, but on tap it's on anther level."
"Although I love IPAs, I will not be adding this one to my list of regulars. Avery likes to push the envelope of drinkability and that is certainly what they did here."
"Overall, though, it is extremely well crafted, as you would expect from one of the best breweries. I would certainly never refuse one of these and I look forward to drinking the rest of the 22 ounce bottle."
"Overall a good but perhaps over-the-top representation of the style. It's pulled off well, but if you don't love hops and big beers, you won't like this beer."
"O: Good flavor and appearance, overall a very tasty version of this style. Good stuff."
"22 ounce bottle, Batch #13, March 2011, 10.54% ABV stated on label. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is mostly citrusy (mango, grapefruit, orange) hops, along with some pine hops and caramel malt. For the most part the taste mirrors the aroma. The citrusy hop flavors are dominant, but the caramel malt flavor is stronger than I thought it was going to be. With that being said, it's still a very tasty brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and goes down pretty easy. I think this is a good overall brew, and one of the better Imperial IPA's out there. This wasn't my first time drinking Maharaja, and it certainly won't be the last time."
"D – Not a repeat beer, one and done, moving on …"
"O- Another 2xIPA that I didn't think I would have. Worth the price and the hype."
"Maharaja is a good beer. I can tell why people would like it so much and why it is deserving of an A-. Unfortunately, it just doesn't agree with my palate. Far too boozy for me to really enjoy. Still a likable beer though."
"Big thanks to JayAre46 for getting this one to me."
"O: A beer I would love to have stocked in the fridge. Have had it now on tap and bottle and it is fantastic. Certainly one of my favorites from Avery thus far."
"O: Not the best batch I've had. I recall others seemed much more hop forward in both the taste and smell. ABV is well hidden, but its presence is definitely felt by the end of the bottle."
"MF/O: Thick and viscous body, prickly carbonation and a bitter citrus/resin finish. Well done"
"Out of a bottle from batch 13 march 2011. This beer is incredible. The beer pours a caramel color with a strong grapefruit note. The smell is tropical hops and a sweet malt. The taste is more hops with a sweet malt background to balance out the hops. The mouthful is a perfect harmony between syrupy and carbonation. Truly the paramount of DIPA that I have ever tasted."
"O- Right at my personal limit for hops. A strict one and done for me. Will have again. Nicely done."
"Overall: A decent DIPA but a little too malty for my liking. Probably nothing i would drink again."
"Final Thoughts - 2011 Maharaja masked the booze better this year. Really, only 3 DIPAs at 10% or above have masked booze better. Younger, Hopslam, Terrapin Side Project 12 Hopzilla."
"The mouthfeel is full and very thick, this is where this brew lets it's 10.5% ABV known. It's also highly carbonated, which works to it's benefit. The drinkability is also exceptional, this brew goes down way easier than 10.5% should. This is just a great DIPA, it has a very complex, hoppy flavor without too much of the alcohol coming forward. Looking forward to popping my DuganA now!"
"Overall - Well you'd never know it was a 10% beer..the alcohol is very well hidden. It sort of reminded me of Gemini by Southern Tier but a little more balanced. I'm happy I got to try it and would love to try it on tap."
"Overall this is a nice complex DIPA with a stonng malt profile upfront and a unique hop profile of grapefruit and mint aas well as a strong boozy bite. A wonderful beer best to be shared with a friend in my opinion."
"Overall: This is a really different tasting IPA. Its very enjoyable and unexpected."
"Very heavy almost syrupy. Kind of reminds me more of a barleywine than a IIPA. A touch too much heat as well, but all in all a nice beer maybe not the best vintage though."
"edit- after looking at alstrom bros review, def notice the tobacco and mint"
"O – A good DIPA but not at the top of my style list, and not at the $11 a bomber I paid. Worth a try for any hop-head, but it will be my last. 3.5"
"A- I thought this one was going to taste very classic to IIPA's but it sort of did its own thing a little. Almost too much going on to describe but it all blends for one of the best beers I have ever had."
"A: 4.5 S: 4.5 T:4.5 M:4.5 D:4.5"
"O: Loved it, a very smooth, very drinkable DIPA. In 'bigness' I think it should be rated right up there with the best."
"O: This is my favorite IPA of all time. It's a fantastic monster of a beer that lives up to, nay, exceeds the hype. Not for everyone I suppose, but I love it."
"O - Overall this beer is one of the best DIPAs that I've had. It is ludicrously bitter and well deserving of all the fame that it recieves. Its bitterness is right up there with Hop Stoopid. I would recommend this beer, but only a bottle at a time or else you can count on praying to the porcelain gods at some point."
"This has a great flavor profile, but the body is heavy so I'll call it above average and be happy to drink it when it is nice and fresh."
"Cheers"
"O-- To me this is the imperial stout when you are drinking a DIPA. It is big and it is aggressive. It is not like the West Coast DIPA's that have the alcohol hidden and can drink several of them. This is a sipper. It is a bit sweet and syrupy at times but it gets bigger and bolder as I drink on. ABV is very apparent and it is a negative but the more air this gets the better it gets and the bigger and more complex. Do not think this is for everybody though. Not a beer you can shoot 2-3 down easily. One is an accomplishment but would very much buy again."
"A very interesting DIPA, very unique flavors compared to other similar styled beers. Really enjoyed it, but a little goes a long way, it's pretty overpowering."
"A unique DIPA. Some odd notes in the flavor, but the hops that are in there are quite delicious."
"O--It's going to get a 4 from me because I think it represents the style well, but it is far from my favorite DIPA. There are plenty others out there that I would rather have. It's a shame, the nose and look of this one led me to believe it was going to be simply amazing."
"Overall, this is a sub-par beer. If I were any less stingy, I would drainpour this. I love everything that Avery has done before this, so this is very, very queer."
"Overall, a really nice DIPA, but a tad overpriced in my opinion. Enjoyable and not a chore to drink, but I think it simply falls short of many others in this style. Definitely worth trying, but I doubt I will go out of my way to get again."
"O - Very nice brew, great DIPA flavor with some great grapefruit and malt mixture of hops. I would consider this a great example of DIPA."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer, especially at the price. I would rate this a little higher, but I prefer the citrus hops to stand out in the front, with the pine as a complement. This beer has that profile reversed."
"As far as Imperial IPA go, this is a very good representation of the style, but there are other which are much better. However given the price point of this brew, this is an awesome bargain and should be on your list of top Imperial IPA's to try and try again year after year."
"O: I am proud to call Colorado home and feel fortunate to have so much great beer, this one being included, accessible and close to home. I'd happily drink this again, without reservation."
"Overall- An awesome beer. I also really like this because its easy to find almost everywhere. I you haven't had this beer do your tongue a favor and make it your next purchase."
" ~ This isn't something I'll seek out again but I will recommend it to friends. The reason being, this is a unique flavored Double IPA. For that it should be sampled."
"Overall - I've had two bottles. The first I was not happy with. The second one I am much happier with. There's definitely an off-flavor in there. The second time around I didn't detect it as much. I have a couple bottles left that I'll definitely drink, but I won't by as much next year until I try it first."
"O: I'm impressed. This is a great, very complex, IIPA. It is probably the sweetest IIPA that I have ever had but I think that the balance that the hops bring at the backend make this a great beer. Get it fresh! I plan on opening another on my birthday this week for sure"
"O: A hop bomb that truly satisfies. Maybe not in the realm of the biggest hitters but deserving of top 100 status."
"O- this is the real deal. taste is fantastic, drinks awesome."
"O- This was my first duel with the Maharaja and it was a great experience. The bottle fresh, the environment right on, and the beer ready to fight, I enjoyed it all very much. I especially congratulate Avery here for not forgetting the importance of malt complexity in a big hoppy beer. Try it."
"O - A very good IPA, though a little different. The strong malt body reminds me a bit of an American Barleywine. Still, very good."
"O- Much more enjoyable this time around- I must have reviewed an older bottle last time. Not my favorite, but def. one to enjoy fresh. Will pick up another this week while I can. I am impressed, Avery wow'd me with this one."
"D - I'm not a huge hop head so like the balance of malty sweetness and the strong hops profile. A nice drink."
"with all the hype I can definitely say this beer isn't quite """divine""" and yes pliny still has my heart...."
" A very delicious Imperial IPA that I would certainly recommend to friends and foes alike, cause every one deserves good beer. Did I mention this was a very drinkable brew. Enjoy!!"
"The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. There is a little notice of the alcohol that detracts just a little. But, overall this is an excellent DIPA."
"Overall: As I finish the last few ounces, I'm taken both by the uniqueness and sheer amount of ingredients used. This is an intense experience, and presents itself like a grand entrance to a great champion. I cannot recommend any food pairings with this, as it just KILLS with overwhelming, sudden force. The high booze taste almost begs to be aged, but therein lies the flaw: High-hopped beverages are best enjoyed fresh. These two competing priorities keep Maharaja from being the Great Gama it seeks to be. It's still a great drink, and definitely worthy of being entered into comparisons with PtY and Bad Boy. But, it lacks the subtle drinkability that accompanies such others in the hop-head category and price range of Nelson and Hop Juice. This imperial reagent needs a little refining before taking the top crown."
"Great Beer!"
"Overall, Maharaja doesn't hide its big alcohol well enough for me. Its hop profile is a little out of my flavor preference and it's too sweet."
"I was looking forward to this beer. Batch number 13, poured from a bomber. The aroma is of alcohol and some citrus hop sweetness. The appearance is golden with a strong red/orange hue. The head does not last long and leaves lots of lacing, indicating that it is probably a very viscous beer. The taste is malty with citrus notes followed immediately by some bitterness. This beer seems a bit sweet. Overall I am glad I was able to pick up a few"
"This was a really rich imperial IPA with a high ABV. If there is a such thing as a winter IPA, this would be it."
"DIPA."
"Overall, pretty good. Definitely worth a try. I love DIPAs and I thought this was good. I wouldn't pay $10.99 for this again, but I'm happy I tried it. Too much alcohol after awhile, and I typically wouldn't say that."
"Not quite as overwhelming that I had on tap but still stellar. This beer should be much higher on the pecking order of top 250 in my opinion."
"Sad, but true..."
"D: Fantastic beer! This is a staple for hop heads and IPA's across the board. The alcohol is very well masked and the hops are seductive and balanced with a solid malt backbone. Great beer for winter or summer."
"Overall, this would e a great beer if it weren't so strong in the booziness... It is a serious flaw in my opinion, and certainly hurts the overall score. This could easily be a top 10 DIPA with a little modification."
"D - This is a balanced DIPA but a very good one. Too strong for sessions, but something that I would purchase again and have on-tap if I knew the keg was fresh."
"Dammit."
"This is a good offering, but I think it could be improved. I'd take a DR 11 over this almost every time.... or even a SN Bigfoot."
"O: The finish on the taste sounds a bit overwhelming, but it the alcohol bite is just noticeable, and it hits with a good amount of bitterness and citrus flavor for a balanced combination. This beer is perhaps one of the best IIPA's I've ever tried, and now that I've tried it fresh, I think I can put it right up there with Green Flash & Double Jack as my favorite IIPA's. (Note, I prefer the citrus characteristics these beers impart more than I do pine, but I respect and enjoy PtE for what it is, but not as much as these 3)."
"This beer really disappointed me. I was hoping for a world class DIPA but this one seems closer to a mess than it does anything spectacular. Hot with alcohol, a ton of hop bitterness, and little of anything else very pleasant. Wanted to enjoy it, but it wasn't anything to write home about."
"(Another dusty bottle on the shelf at Ryan's. Batch 12.)"
"Pours a majestic crystal clear deep orange/red with a thick fluffy white sudsy head. Gorgeous richness and clarity on the appearance. On the nose this has a lot of citrusy, piney hops with some biscuit malt in the background and a bit of heat. The first sip hits you with a considerably weighty mouthfeel. This is a sweet, oily, viscous high alcohol brew. Spicy malt notes mingle with plenty of bitter hops. The richness makes this hard to drink a lot of but not surprising given the 10%+ abv. All in all a massive DIPA that impresses with it's power. Go big or go home!"
"Love the new label, """Dictator's Series.""" I love dictators. The beer has a wonderful aroma, citrus, melon, and flower-like sweetness, much like Hopslam. Taste - buttery, earthy, and herbal, like drinking an herb garden in a bottle. Appearance - very golden red, with ample foam. Drank in a snifter for optimum aroma. Kind of a combination between a barleywine and double IPA. Will try to acquire more of this tomorrow."
"S: The DIPA has a"
"Overall: World-class!"
"(D)- This DIPA deserves the praise it gets. One of the best? No, but its up there. Great stuff and enjoyable."
"O. I liked this beer more than I thought I would. This is a well crafted DIPA that actually drinks super easy for its ABV. A bomber on an empty stomach sure tasted good but kicked my ass."
"Very good example of the style, albeit catering to the sweet-tooth contingent among serious hop-heads..."
"Wow, you can actually smell pungent and citrusy hops just upon opening the bottle! Avery usually delivers, and this one is no exception. It pours a slightly hazy reddish-copper body with orangeish highlights beneath a short but creamy head of white. Unfortunately, the head doesn't hold quite as well as might be hoped for (but with 10.54 % alcohol by volume (102IBU) that's to be expected!), and it does leaves some thin rings of lace about the glass. A firmly caramelish and delicately biscuity malt comes into play within the aroma, although the hops are still clearly present with notes of grass, pineapple, orange peel, dried pine needles, and muddled grapefruit. In the mouth its filling and dextrinous as the very-fine-bubbled carbonation warms and becomes airy before sliding away like silk pajamas on silk sheets. The flavor delivers a heavier blow than the aroma suggests with its solid maltiness ducking and weaving between punches of hop flavor and hits of solid bitterness. There's no real pattern to the way that it appears on the palate, and slaps of hops or hits of malt seem to come and go in a different fashion with each sip. Everyc omponent is always there, but certain characteristics just seem to pop at times. The one constant, however, is it's lingering, resinous and citrus-fruit-rind finish. There's bitterness there as well, but it doesn't come across as being raspy because of the thin but sticky layer of sweet malt that so stealthily hides itself while slowly receeding. It's a really nice, very well-balanced IPA that offers a decent amount of changing character in its profile; but might actually be lacking in complexity due to it's being """too balanced""" - if that's possible. Still, this IPA rocks! The alcohol rarely appears, and its bitterness never overwhelms the palate! You can't drink too many because of the strength, but it's definitely drinkable."
"A unique take on the style for sure, I was expecting sweet after the nose but in a different way. After a floral nose I expected bright raw hops, but it was slightly earthy and short of West Coast bitter. Good brew but best taken as fresh as possible."
"I'm havin a hard time finishing this. It really has a weird bitterness and taste. It's not infected. Just must be this years batch. Not very good. I think I'll be pouring the rest."
"This is a hop monster in the beginning but about half way thru this beer is easy drinking...Pretty scary for a 10.3% brew. I wish I had another right about now."
"O: I feel this is a wonderful example of the style the probably gets overlooked because it's not draft-only or limited release. I'll look for it again."
"Such a big brew. I love this one, had it a while ago from a bottle then later from a bottle and it wasn't as good. I saw it was on tap at Tap & Table in Emmaus so shot over after work. Got myself three wonderful glasses of this. The aroma and flavor mix well with each other the fruity hop aroma hits your nose on every sip. Then the piney sting of hops hits your tongue and just attacks it till you sip again and it just keeps coming. The color is a very nice golden color with a minimal head on it about 1 fingers worth. The brew is very tasty and if you haven't tried it please do so."
"Was this a bad batch?"
"Drink- Overall, a very good IPA. Nice balanced bold flavors that call to be enjoyed. Would have this one again."
"Pours copper color with a nice white head. The nose is amazing. Lot's of pineapple, grapefruit, citrus, really amazing. The taste has more of a malt backbone, but the high ABV isn't really noticeable. Definitely a lot of hops in there. This is an outstanding IIPA. There's only one I can think of that I like better."
"I wish they brewed this year round. It is a must try and I recommend it to everyone that asks me about IIPA's."
"Overall: Almost a """5"" in my book (but not quite). Extremely drinkable, almost chuggable. Not heavy or boring. Sure, a tad too sweet at times but oh-so-pleasant all around. Not for the hop-lover, but if you're seeking a more balanced and drinkable DIPA, this might be it."
"All in all though this one is a beast, it is more hopy than malty but it is not one-dimensional in the least bit."
"One of my favs for sure!"
"O: A good beer, but doesn't measure up to some of the other TIPA's out there. It's starting to become a chore to finish the glass, but I certainly got my hop fix."
"Poured into a new Lost Abbey stem glass. Pours an almost-clear orange color with a medium-large white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is very hoppy with some fresh pine and floral hop notes. I also get great melon and grapefruit notes. A bit of alcohol as well. Taste is very hoppy with a strong alcohol flavor. Boozier than last batch, but I like it. Such an amazing DIPA. Tons of melon and hops with a lot of sweet malt and nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is complex and full-bodied with delicious drinkability. Overall, a top of the line Imperial IPA. This beer also ages well for it's style."
"Overall Avery knocks this one out of the park for me, flavorfull DIPA that I'd be happy to get anyday"
"Final thought - $7 a bottle, you might as well get 3, one for now, one for a few months from now and one to see what happens next release"
"D- The well masked ABV makes this one easy to drink, not to mention the great flavors and light crispness offered by the """Great""" ""King.""" If I am lucky enough to spot another one of these on the shelves, I will be sure to grab it. This DIPA stands out pretty boldly against many others."
"Rich, thick mouthfeel with a heat burn that reminds of the 10+ abv tag. A sipper, but one that I would reach for more often when guaranteed fresh bottles."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Beer is Amber with a nice caramel colored head. Smells of hops and citrus with a slight fruitiness to it. Tastes deep and delicious with lots of hops, malt and a fair amount of fruit including a little peach. Full bodied on the palate, but not tiresome. This is a great beer which drinks well despite its 10.3 abv which will kick you in the butt."
"The CPJ"
"Very drinkable for the ABV, this is a very well made double IPA."
"D - This has very good drinkability. I really like this beer. It has a lot of citrus, but it is still sweet, boozy, and it has a nice hop bitterness. I could easily drink a lot of these, even though the high ABV. I definitely recommend trying this one. Cheers."
"Lets start off by saying how great this beer was! poured very hazy orangish. had a good one finger frothy head. smelled of great hops and light aroma of fruits. Mouth feel was great. I really could not get enough of this. but my favorite thing about this beer had nothing to do with the taste. it has to do with the bottle. it displays the ABV not as 10.30 but more accurately as 10.27% amazing."
"Poured from bomber into dimpled glass. Pours slightly hazy orange with a thick frothy beige head. I can see tons of sediments floating about (turn off for me especially in a DIPA). Aroma of pine, orange, dank hops, sweet malt. Taste is bitter, piney hops with a huge malt body. Hops are quite bold and resinous but the body is equally as large and present. Though, this is a good DIPA that does not have that sweet citrusy hop like so many have now. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, but blends well with all the other flavors. Medium lived bitter finish, lively but smooth carbonation. I would have enjoyed this more without the sediments floating about."
"Then again, neither am I. Maybe me and the Maharaja have something in common after all."
"Drinkability wise, I wouldn't turn one down but I also wouldn't go out of my way to get another."
"D- Excellent beer totally surprised. The nuttiness and malts combined with the hops was superb. Very easy drink especially for being over 10% abv. Highly recommend this one."
"D: This is a very good sipper. I would obviously rather have it fresh but it's still good at 11 months."
"D - Two pints and I was done. The Maharaja is a fierce tyrant that will smack you around. Be careful."
"This review is a redo for me, because my initial review was an outdated bottle. Poured on-tap in a goblet, the beer is a hazy orange-amber coloring, with a frothy, thick beige colored head of about an inch. The head is airy and light, and it settles a bit, but leaves a strong lace along the glass as it does. Aromas of white wine (almost muscat), pear, citrus, and a subtle resinous highlight. The beer is fruit forward, with grape, grapefruit, and mango, with a solid booze characteristic, wine highlights, and some woody notes. The beer is bold and full bodied in mouth, and has a slightly bitter, richly sweet and resinous aftertaste. The finish is lingering, with booze and bitterness throughout. Heavy hitter."
"I bought a bottle of this in Washington. It pour an interesting orangish color, and had good tones of citrus in the the smell, could smell the hops. The taste was obviously bitter, I liked it, it wasn't a disgusting bitter, but a good smell and taste, had a good drink-ability."
"Pours dark orange with a two-finger head. Solid lacing and retention. Sweet citrus aroma. The flavor follows. Big grapefruit and citrus hops. . Followed by sweet and creamy malt background. Nice pine bitterness on the close. The flavor was there, but not very cohesive. Big alcohol notes as well as the beer warmed."
"Conclusion: The head is really impressive with fine micro bubbles. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I think it rates in the top ten in its class. One I am looking forward to revisiting since DIPAs are one of my favorites."
"I will be buying more of these."
"Pours clean with little to no head. Dark golden color, transparent. Smells sweet, citrusy and hoppy. Tastes really good, bitters sit on the back of the mouth with a nice citrus finish. Bold citrus and hops with sweet malty undertones. Feels smooth with light carbonation. Very tastey for its class, will delightfully drink again."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkable? This much hops and flavor can't be guzzled. I could drink one every day. Two every day would be like homework."
"Had this out of a 22 oz. bomber bottled in march 2010. I have had this beer a few times but thought i should review it on BA. This is by far the best brew that ive had from Avery, for a DIPA this had everything that i am looking for. At first the pour in nice and a little thick giving me a nice amber colored beer with an inch and a half of off white head. The smell is amazing!! Loaded with hops and citrus, a little malt but hops hops hops. Taste is amazing as well. Hops and malted barley coat the tongue and goes down so smooth you can forget that its 10.3% ABV. Nice and thick, which is great for a DIPA. For anyone looking for an ideal IPA this is the beer."
"Overall this is a wonderful DIPA; as someone that likes malty examples this favors my preferences. This was quite refreshing and something i would buy again when available. If you are looking for a traditional palate wrecking DIPA look elsewhere as this is excellently balanced with malt sweetness and Pacific citrusy hops."
"OVERALL: Finally Avery makes a big beer worth drinking twice. Enjoyed working my way through this one. Quite tasty with lots of flavor and bitterness, as well as a great look. Definitely a bit too harsh and boozy for the style, which makes it either difficult or unique, depending on your preferences, but nevertheless, this is the first Avery beer I've had that was worth the effort."
"All and all a pretty nice beer, would recommend for hop heads and beer lovers."
"22oz bottle from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI. Pours a beautiful and glowing hazed amber hue with golden edges, two fingers of cream coloured froth, and sheets of lacing on the nonic glass. Smell is caramel, orange peel, toasty malt, citrus, pine, vanilla cake batter, burnt sugar, honey, resiny and floral hops, tobacco, and mint. Flavour is juicy tangerine, more orange peel, piny and citric hop tang, very zesty, spicy, and oily in character, balancing toffee and caramel sweetness, lingering bitterness with some alcoholic burn to end. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, bordering on syrupy, acidic bite with warming liquor in the finish. This is a fantastic, hop-forward DIPA, but it packs a little too much booze for my liking, and at 9 months old it may have lost some of its hop wallop. Still, if the ethanol were turned down a notch, this would be a benchmark IIPA."
"** came back to edit because I took a look at the Avery website and saw that this beer is 102 IBUs. I am very surprised, either it is the most balance 102 IBUs I've ever had or it is lower than they report. I am betting on the former though, it is a very balanced beer."
"Poured on tap into a chalice. Nice head. Insane aroma of citrus fruits like grapefruit, tangerine, orange, lemon. Taste was sublime. CITRUS CITRUS CITRUS. Warming alcohol finish. More than two of these would be dangerous. I can't believe the hop aroma and flavor I'm getting from this beer! Fairly drinkable despite the some 10% abv. This is a delicious double IPA! Total citrus BOMB. Simply amazing..."
"D: Moderately drinkable."
"OVERALL: I had this beer as my dessert after my girlfriend cooked a wonderful steak dinner. I could not have asked for a finer dessert. Rich, delicious and very satisfying."
"S-Nose has citrus and hop smell, and has my mouth watering."
"D/O- This DIPA doesn't hide the booze well and that's alright with this guy. The 10.41% keeps it real...don't know what that means...but yeah! Props to Avery."
"Drinkabilty - Its just so strong, a sipper beer for sure. Not something to drink weekly. The 22oz was more then enough. Well drink again next year or so. Cant get much better for a high hop beer."
"I'm not sure you can make an Imperial IPA that's very drinkable, but you'd never know this was highly alcoholic and so heavily hopped."
"D: Pretty good for a 10+% ABV, but the hops could become a little much after a full bottle."
"Light haze, medium amber with an orange hue. Dense, creamy, eggshell cap, tons of lacing, decent head retention. Aromas of caramel and hops, biscuity malts, tropical fruit, citrus and pine, slightly grassy, hint of alcohol. Nice balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness -- both are impressive in weight, so getting the tension between these two qualities is well-done. Tropical fruit and alcohol, less citrus and pine than in the aroma, caramel and biscuity malt. Slight spicy, peppery quality towards the end. Lingering bitterness tempered by grainy, husky malt. Full bodied with a slight syrupy character, creamy carbonation, considerable alcohol warmth. I can't believe I've waited this long to try the Maharaja, but some of Avery's other beers were less than awe-inspiring. A solid (and potent) entry in this class and pretty tasty, though fairly malt-forward."
"I found Avery Maharaja (Batch 11) to be an impressive hop bomb that provides a slow and serious quaff, one deserving respect along with the appropriate glassware at the proper temperature."
"D: Great combination of all things I enjoy. This is an exceptional beer that can hit you hard if you aren't careful. Thanks Avery!"
"D- A good solid hop-bomb with more sweetness than hop-bombs are known for. Almost like a hop liquor without the liquor heat."
"Drinkability on this particular bottle, being somewhat aged, the flavor is definitely depreciated. And the high abv make it a sipper."
"D: Almost too easy. If I had this in a pint, I might have drank it too quickly. I will certainly drink this beer again. One of the best IIPA I have had to date."
"D- its a sipper, but a damn good one. Tastes like a boozy, bitter orange juice...one hell of a combination"
"Taste is quite sweet and very rich and malty. There are hops here but to me it's more like a barleywine. Mouthfeel is thick and bready with a bit of a hop bite on the finish."
"D- Great beer, a bit sweet but overall delicious, very easy to forget its a 10.5% beer"
"First pour from a 1L growler into a clean pint glass. Nice golden / copper color, 2 fingers of creamy off-white head leaving nice lacing. Wonderful hop aroma, citrus, pine, earthy, some caramel malts as well. Big, bold flavors in this DIPA - the hops are very upfront and in your face (bitter citrus and a piney / resiny bite), but are eventually balanced out by a sweet malt finish. Some nice warmth to this beer, especially as it reaches room temp. Medium bodied and well carbonated. A wonderful all around DIPA - as someone that doesn't like malty examples, this was quite refreshing and something i would buy again when available."
"Very good, a bit too much of a resiny grapefruit hop bomb for my tastes, but I'd definitely get this again when I'm in the mood for such a thing."
"All Maharaja is amazing. It is one of the best IPAs in America and that is really saying something. But this batch, this was something of truly rare quality. I'm just happy I got to enjoy it."
"A very good DIPA that managaes to hide the alcohol better than, say, Double Dog."
"I love this beer. Simple as that. Ok, ok so I am a bit of a hop head and the heavy hand of hops used in the creation of this bad boy definitely plays to my tastes. But, the 2010 release of this is quite well balanced with a sweetness that comes through after the initial hop assault. The 10.5% ABV does not overwhelm with an alcohol bite like other high % beers I've had, in fact if one's not careful that 10.5 will sneak up on you by the end of the bottle. Trust me I know. Indeed going through a bottle of this is quite easy as its a surprisingly drinkable beer. This beer is a must try for all, even the non-hop heads."
"Poured into a goblet. Not much head, decent lacing. Balance of all the usual hop smells. Very strong but holds up nicely. Plenty bitter for hop heads but worked for me too. Moderate body & slickness, boozy and oily, above average overall feel without sacrificing drinkability -- definitely doesn't give away its entire >10% nature."
"D- Beer is balanced and super tasting. 10.5% though so be careful"
"One of my favorites"
"As far as an actual review, the appearance was so-so, didnt really look like anything amazing. Smell was great, there are alot of things going on there including citrusy hops, biscuit malts, and a slight alcohol burn as it warms up. Taste was more of the same, I actually liked it better when it got warm. It tasted more like a liquor than beer. Mouthfeel like I said was thick and syrupy. Drinkability is low, I might have a hard time finishing the growler by the end of the week without help. Overall a great strong ale that I will definitely remember whenever I think about this vacation spot!"
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good but I thought it was a little too sweet for a DIPA."
"A very very good D/I IPA, as most possibly a little too sweet for me. But close to perfect ..."
"1/10/14-Release No. 17 (2013) Second time reviewing and it looks basically the same except the head faded slowly and it left nice rings as it went down (score went up). Aroma is very sweet, like fresh hop juice mixed with pineapple, mango, orange and a handful of citrus hops; barleywine sweetness again, with caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, strong piney notes, graham cracker and sweet malt. Really sweet with a nice hop presence. Tastes like it smells, with strong citrus hops, pineapple, mango, orange, piney hops, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon, spices like pepper and coriander, graham cracker, sweet malt and light booze that trails off very sweet. Malts are strong for an IPA but still let the hops tale the spotlight, and this hides the ABV very well. Overall pretty drinkable but a tad bit too sweet. It's bold and complex, but manages to be easy enough to drink while being rather aggressive so I upped the overall rating a bit. One bomber will do some damage as the ABV is hidden by the sweetness and hop assault."
"Yeah, that tang gives this beer a pop! But otherwise it's still sweet and pleasant. A little heavy, a little odd, but really delicious anyway."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: The feel on this beer is outstanding. Between light and medium bodied, nice fine carbonation. This beer is very near to creamy, which I don't get very often in this style. Overall, very good DIPA. A touch too much alcohol on the palate hurts it somewhat, but it is still very good."
"D - This is a great example of this beer style. I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again, but if you put it next to Sculpin and Pliny it loses. Overall though, its extremely drinkable and great smelling, but i prefer more piney, citrusy hop bombs."
"Cheers..."
"If they could somehow knock down that aftertaste by an hour or two (kidding) this would be one phenomenal IPA, but it's still pretty damn good."
"Thank you Bierkraft. What a wonderful thing to find in my mail box. Pours a nice 1/2 inch head after jumping out of the bottle. Nice dark dark golden colour with a wonderful aroma. Almost syrupy consistency. Has the piney citrusy taste. I hope it gives me the carb loading I need for my 50 K bike ride! Mouthtaste is like a hop sandwich. Full bodied. I would say it is vey drinkable but not my choice for a session. I will try again and again, though."
"Overall a world class DIPA that was so tasty when fresh from tap. What a treat. Recommend highly."
"Pours a nice amber color with a white head and excellent lacing. This is one of the most pleasant smells of hops I've ever experienced, with a lovely piney overtone. The taste is bitter upfront with some decent malt coming up on the finish to balance it out. The presence of pine disappears from the taste and is not apparent at all is it is in the nose. Some sweetness fights to break through, but isn't quite able to overcome that bitter upfront taste. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, despite the dark color. Very drinkable. So drinkable, I bought a growler of this home after having a glass with dinner. An excellent double-IPA, probably only 2nd in my experience to Pliny."
"Drinkability is OK. The hops in Maharaja are huge, which I like, but the malt and the booze take away from it a little bit. Overall, this is still a pretty good IIPA though."
"D: This is one of those IIPA that I could come back to time and time again, and do, where you are impressed, just as much as the first time. An outstanding beer."
"This is a really, really good beer. So pleasantly subtle, extremely drinkable, but with such characters and fragrant hoppiness. Lovely drop."
"D - Fairly hoppy, and the there's enough malt that makes this not a super refreshing beer. Plus, the alcohol is pretty high. Still, it's quite delicious, and I'll give this a 4 for drinkability."
"D-This was probably the best DIPA >= 10% ABV I have had and it comes closer to the DIPA style than the others I have reviewed. A bit pricey, but I will look forward to trying a fresher batch in the future, willing to modify the scores if warranted."
"D - suits my pallet. Really nice imperial IPA. Curious what it is like fresh."
"Pretty much your typical DIPA with a kick in the mouth hop flavor. This one leaves the mouth dry as the Sahara but is a wonderful example of its style"
"D: heavy beer and quite a sipper."
"d- okay, not great because of the high abv. i've gotta say i'm really disappointed that i'm not loving this - i think this is another one like hopslam that i'm really pissed i'm not enjoying as much as i'd like to be."
"Overall, I give this a PHAT 9 of 10. Very surprised at the wonderful compliment of flavors."
"Drinkability is unreal with this, my girlfriend and I were getting 12 oz. pours for $4, and I had around 3 or so, no wonder I got sloshed, I had NO idea it was this high of an ABV., glad I took notes!"
"American beer at its best here, hopefully it's one more known example where the industry is going and how far it can reach when it comes to the level of flavor. If you are a hophead and have yet to try this beer, what are you waiting for?!!"
"Appearance has a nice cloudy amber color with a thick head that sticks around awhile with good lace. Smell of rich malts, tangy sweet fruits with nice background earthiness. Taste is rich in malts, sweet grapefruit with a nice balance of floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a good spike of carbonation. A good sipping IIPA to watch the first opening game of the 2010 football season."
"I can feel this one creeping up on me, with about 1/3rd to go. Yet it leaves the mouth watering for more. Don't let the man on the label start diabolically laughing at you while waiving his sword and stroking his mustache..."
"I would describe this as dangerously drinkable, and the imperial pint is disappearing at an alarming rate. I really enjoy this beer and can see why it is so popular."
"This is a fine pour. A bit too much hop haze for my like, but the color is beautiful. The head is too big. Suggest they reduce priming sugar. Regardless it's a fine pour. Taste is better as it goes. For a 10+AVB the high BU covers nicely. In our State of Florida, it's better than most. Available at Whole Foods."
"Drink- Tasty beer, but still a tough beer to enjoy a lot of. The 10.4% alcohol is very noticeable as is the significant amount of hops. Would still recommend to someone who is interested in this style."
"Drinkable? Well, for the 10.5 abv and being an IPA, I'd say it does decently. But what beer will you feel cooler drinking? Not many."
"Reddish-orange in color with a deep haze. Lots of active carbonation along with tons of yeasty floaties makes this one very interesting to look at. Big floral bouquet, pine and tropical fruit. Despite the high ABV no hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with medium carbonation and a dry finish. Sweet malty character that is quickly overcome by the piney hop flavor. Finishes with a complex tropical fruit hoppiness and a touch of alcohol heat. Definitely a sipper, but easy to drink."
"Avery Maharaja was served in a 10 oz tulip that came to the table a bright copper color with dissolving foam that started leaving lacing on the glass. The beer smelled very resinous with good pine notes, sweet tropical fruit, and rich doughy malt.. The beer was very bitter with a sweetness from the malts as well as fragrant ripe pineapple. The low level of carbonation allowed the flavors to really come out of the beer and gave the beer a very thick smooth texture."
"D-This is dangerously drinkable in that the alcohol is there, but not at the nearly 10.5% ABV (my bottle says 10.48%) that this one clocks in at. If I had to guess what the ABV on this one was, I'd mid to high 8%. Probably my favorite DIPA to date."
"D: Although alcohol is prominent with every sip, the 10.48% goes down smooth. A great IIPA with lots of character."
"Mouthfeel is a very creamy texture that goes down well. Overall an enjoyable D.I.P.A. but nothing I'm going to go out of my way for (since we dont get it locally)."
"D: A nice DIPA, but I would have liked a stronger maltyness to balance the great hops."
"Notes: Tries to be East Coast style in malt body, but has West Coast drying hop character. A perfect style bender and one of my favorites!"
"Drinkability: This has turned into a nice drinking """barleywine""". I'm sure it would've been much better fresh, but the hops do not hold up very well with 3 months in the bottle."
"Overall: One of the many bench-mark setting IIPAs!"
"Man oh man- fresh Maharaja on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Gotta love it. Well, I do anyhow. I love this beer, and the fresher the better. This is fresh! Pours a dark orange amber with a very full head that fades to thin cap but leaves lacing that coats the glass. Smells nicely of summit hops, and is hugely herbal. Taste is similar- a citrus and herb explosion with enough sweet malt to balance things. Very smooth in the mouth and juicy. A great experience!"
"The only thing that hurts this beer is the alcohol pushing its way to the front which leads to a diminished drinkability."
"Pours a dark hazy amber with huge cap og stiff merangue like white head, great retention and lacing. Scent is made of huge whiffs of citrus, tropical and pine notes with a solid carmely sweet malt backbone present. First taste is a bitter rush of the hop notes mentioned above, backed by the lightly carmel and grahmn crackery sweet malt backbone. Medium bodied, oily, coating but high in carbonation, dry finnish. A very nice dIPA that is big and bold and could sitll affect a bruised palate."
"D: Tasty and not repelling in the least. Nothing too enthralling, but very solid."
"Overall, an amazing ADIPA that I most highly recommend. This one is near perfection for me and my go to beer for when I want to have excellent flavor and just relax. As much as I've had this I was surprised that I hadn't reviewed it. Available here in TX. Rotation - heavy rotation and a must when I can find it on tap. Only problem I find (two if you count only being rotating release) is that I've had it many times on tap at the brewery so I'm spoiled by the really fresh ones which are hard to get in Texas. We seem to have 1-2 month lag time from release in CO to here. [R;Y]"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style. Carbonation is moderate and feels pretty appropriate. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol coming through hurts it a bit but the hoppiness is just so delicious it can overcome it. I love the tropical, juicy, hoppy beers and this one definitely fits into that category. One of my favorite DIPA's."
"D-A truly delicious and easy drinking beer.A deceptively high ABV that could be dangerous."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a nice frothy off white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is pine hops with some citrus in front of sweet caramel malts. The taste is loads of pine and citrus hops in front of burnt caramel malts. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a bit of alcohol presence, but the 10.3% is very well hidden. I have always been a fan of this beer, at least when it's fresh (I've had it 9 months old and found it almost putrid) and this draft version was just what I hoped it would be."
"A solid DIPA."
"Feb. 2009 bottle from City Beer in SF. People say the hops in these """fade""" after a couple of months. Well 2+ months after bottling, this one wasn't faded, but after drinking it and a few homebrews, I definitely was! Ok, bad joke. Anyway, wow. This is definitely top 10 in style I've had thus far. Deep golden color with a foamy white head. Strong piney hop aroma with a little malt thrown in. Flavor is lots of sweet caramel malt with a huge citrusy/piney hop punch and some slight light fruit notes. Medium-full, fairly oily on the palate. Party on, excellent."
"Above average ipa, worth trying but not worth searching out or trading for."
"Hazy orange pour with a dense off-white head that fades to a nice lacing. Loads of juicy grapefruit aroma with caramel and honey in the background. Lots of citrus hops upfront in the flavor with a strong floral note. Some sweet malts coming out which are then quickly overpowered by a lingering pine flavor and a healthy dose of alcohol. Has a hint of spiciness in the aftertaste too. Full body with a dry finish coming from the alcohol content."
"This is not the most drinkable beer, but deserves a good score for its complexity."
"The beer is sweet first, medium to big in body. I suppose this is what people call a balanced IPA. Eh, its kind of malty and the bitterness is cut overall by the malt. Its not dry, its kind of boring. Definitely not my favorite IPA."
"22oz bottle. Pours a deep orange that is very cloudy. Little head but some thick lacing. Smells somewhat sweet with a very pleasing citrus and pine hop aroma. Tastes of grapefruit and some orange with an obvious presence of Hops. Some malts as well. For an Imperial Ipa with a ABV over 10%, it doesn't have an overwhelming taste of alcohol. A bit pricey compared to some other Dipas that taste better or as good, but overall a really good beer. Hope to have it on tap sometime."
"All in all, a decent DIPA, but not one I intend to buy again. The package just didn't come together for me."
"D - This is a seriously well made Imperial IPA, I commend the talented folks at Avery for the fact that malt presence and yet still an abundance of hop flavor and long finishing with only a very mild alcohol influence on the taste - you definitely know it is there after the first glass which is whey I gave a 4, but very smooth for the strength of 10.3%"
"D-Pretty drinkable had it a few times and always go back"
"Bomber poured dark hazy orange. Thick off white head stuck all the way around the glass. Smells of figs, dates and apricots, toasty sweet malts and citrus. First a sudden burst of piney hops and heavy malts. Hints of orange and caramel peak through the hot alcohol taste at the end. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Drinkability suffers because ABV is not hidden as well as some in the style. Overall pretty good."
"D - Very tasty, a nit heavy and high in ABV to have a lot, but I'm finding this one bottle to be very easy to drink, and am happy to have another in the fridge!"
"Pours a reddish amber with a nice off-white head and decent lacing as it goes down. Smell is tropical fruits, some citrus, and a few hints of earth. The taste is much the same, but it lacks the punch of the nose and some of the more-intense West-coast DIPA's. Medium body and somewhat dry. Drinkability is affected by a bit of an alcohol taste and a slight lack of cohesion to the hop flavor and intensity."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Head lasts, and laces delicately yet plentifully. Aroma is juicy fruit hops. Taste starts with a light malt sweetness, and quickly morphs into fruity hops which tantalize, yet do not overpower. We're talking hops flavor here, not just the bitter hammer over the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, which can sometimes be daunting. An almost subtle yet effective brew, surprised by this one"
"D - One of my favorite DIPAs. Had everything working for it. Really something to try. That 10% does sneak up on you though!"
"The taste is big on the malts rather than the hops, but as this beer has been sitting around for almost 2.3 years I should've known the hops would be faded. Malt tastes traditional with toffee and caramel. What hops I do taste remind me of white grapes, mango, slight grapefruit and a bug orange flavor with a slight lemon citrus edge. This fresh might blow my socks off with hops. The mouth feel was full without being heavy and a little chalky at the end but no big deal. The drinkability was great and a sure benefit of its age. No alcohol tastes what so ever. This could have been a 7% brew as far as I could taste but as it's 10.5 or so, good job beer. Overall I think this is good but I need to try it fresh."
"DB- I am not going to complain about the price, you get a freakin' huge beer but one that is slightly over the top. Lots of hops in a flavor that will probably prevent you from legitimately reviewing another beer. Amazing looks, great smell, good flavor... you will remember this one for sure. It might be a bit much to drink a whole bomber solo but I didn't get sick of it."
"M: medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a fruity, sweet, oily, and hop bitter punch crisp finish."
"Bottled March 2010. Batch 11."
"Even though this isn't my ideal DIPA, it's a very impressive brew."
"Edited for change from Drinkability to Overall."
"D- I got through it, not my favorite double, not one i'll seek out again. Too east coast for me, this is nearing Stoudt's DIPA territory for me, not a good look."
" Drinkability is Superior,each sip leaves you wanting another,the sooner the better. Top Notch Stuff!"
"D: Goes down smooth, especially for being so strongly flavored!"
"I love this IIPA a lot, this particular batch was 10.69% abv. Even with the huge alcohol content i could drink this all year round."
"This is a VERY drinkable beer. I would keep this permanently stocked if I could."
"Drinkability - One and I'm done. I've been meaning to try this but it isn't what I was expecting it to be. I feel there are two heavy competing tastes - the massive bitterness which gives way to a heavy malty backbone. I personally don't like beers made as such, so it is just personal preference. Also, there is definitely a slight alcohol taste while sipping this beer, and a noticeable warming of the throat."
"D= One of the best IPAs I have tried as I make my way through a style that I previously did not care for. They are winning me over in a big way."
"D - This beer is almost too drinkable for the ABV. So good, so balanced, and once of my all time favorite Imperial IPAs!!!"
"Drinkability is extremely high. Tons and tons of hops, yet very balance. Probably the best DIPA I've ever drank!!"
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours red-orange with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet hops and a very slight hint of malt. The flavor was big on hops, with a bitter bite upon swallowing. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a nice IIPA. The hop flavor can start to get a little overwhelming after some time but the bite at the finish is quite nice. This one is a must try for all hop heads out there as it is pretty close to be a complete hop bomb."
"D. This is an addicting beer, but will fill you up fast, and that boozy character is chock full of """bang you up""" so I have never drank more than 2 or 3 of these at a sitting."
"D: A great DIPA but pretty sweet and boozy--not as balanced as it needs to be"
"Drinkability: Moderate due to the weight and the ABV, but the smells and flavors are great and I would love to sip on this beer over the entire course of an evening."
"D-for 10.something% abv its incredibly drinkable; even as it warmed the alcohol was not really apparent; it's not crushingly bitter even for 102 ibu's, i think cuz of the massive amount of malts to balance it out; it is a bit expensive...$10 for a 22oz bottle in Maryland"
"Drinkability is fine, yet at 10% abv it's a heavy hitter. It's too hot, in my opinion. One is plenty. I'd been considering getting a bottle; I'm glad I held out for the tap."
"I wanna love this beer but it's just not to my taste. I find it to be too sweet. I don't mind a balanced IPA, but the combination of malty sweet and Imperial IPA bitterness is off-putting. Maharaja is reminiscent of 90 minute which I've never been a big fan of. I love the scent and the hop flavors, and I can see why this beer is very appealing to others...but it's just not my thing."
"D: Exceptionally good, I would drink this IPA all night until I fell off my chair."
"Drinks: with increasing difficulty. Maharaja is decent at first sip, but became increasingly bitter and tart as it warmed. Even my tulip glass seemed too much for me by the end."
"D: It's pretty solid at first, but that's about the kindest thing I can say about it. It aspires to greatness but is ultimately not. By the second half of the bottle, the candied-grapefruit and booze one-two is starting to win the battle, and I'm contemplating throwing the rest of my glass out. You win this one, Avery. I won't buy again."
"Overall very tasty, but something with the balance of this beer has always bugged me, it just doesnt all mesh together for me and leaves me thinking a few tweaks could make it amazing."
"This beer suites my taste as I am a lover of hoppy beers. The beer pours with a head which I found to be bigger and frothier than most IPA's (poured from a bottle into a glass). It is difficult to describe the taste other than ultra hoppy and bitter, but with the taste and finish one would expect of a high quality IPA. It is a strong beer but this cannot be detected in its taste. While I haven't tasted many Avery beers, I have yet to find one that I did not like."

"22 ounce bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a beautiful bright amber with a huge billowing head a full 2 inches thick. Aroma is all resinous hops made up of primarily pine with some citrus. Great head on the beer that just clings to the glass. Hops are right at the front of the first sip giving way to a surprising malt backbone before it finishes with more earthy hops. Definetely a hop-head's dream, with hops of pine, pine (yes, that's twice), citrus, and grass all on the palate at once. Nice body to the beer thanks to the malt, though the hops really coat your entire mouth and throat the more you drink it. The beer just clings to your mouth. It also has a cumulative effect - the more you drink the more you taste the hops, though the malt and yeast adds some nice sweetness. Fantastic beer and one of my favorite examples of the double IPA style."
"The taste - Well at this point, it better be fantastic some might say, and don't worry, this beer does not disappoint, not with the first sip, not with the last... all the way thru, this beer is a philharmonic orchestra for the tongue/mouth... Very few beers are this pleasurable to drink/taste from start to finish... especially for some like myself who finds joy in drinking a great beer..."
"Dark, copper ale that pours with a rich thick head that laces nicely. Has a heavy taste to it with a strong hop profile and potent hops. Sediment collects on the bottom of the glass but doesn't come up with each sip/gulp. Definitely a tasty IPA that satisfies but not something that you could drink during a session."
"D - good drinkablity even considering the north of 10% abv. great dipa, will have again."
"D: With the large ABV, everything is worked in nicely. A bit too sweet overall perhaps--but the alcohol would likely stick out if it weren't as apparent"
"D - I've had Maharaja on several occasions in the past, but this is the first time I've gotten to have it really fresh. Alcohol is pretty noticeable and quite high at 10.3%. Flavor is really good, especially as it enters the mouth on each sip, but turns a bit harsh towards the swallow. This keeps this out of the upper echelon of DIPA's for me, but is still quite an outstanding example of the style."
"Note edit: When I reviewed last night I had just had a sneezing fit. Upon smelling and tasting today I realize I need to make adjustments. It is actually quite good but still far from the best. And damn the alcohol heat really is strong."
"Drinkability is good. Alcohol is well-concealed. Pretty tasty beer."
"D: Finding sipping this to be quite enjoyable and pleasant on a warm day like this. Would definitely go back to pick another one of these up. ABV is high, of course but for an IIPA it's barely noticeable. Lovely beer."
"Drinkability: While I like this beer and will be happy to have it again, for my tastes it falls just a bit short of the mark in that the malt backbone is too prominent and too dominant. It will be a treat once in a while to keep me attuned to the wonderful variety inherent in the DIPA style, but it won't be a standard feature in my fridge."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Hazy copper pour with nice caramel-white head and decent lacing. Nose is a bit disappointing. It's all pine with a hint of alcohol and not much else. Almost like medicine. The taste is all malty caramel sweetness and alcohol at the start. Very piney but the hop bite is conspiculously subdued. Some bitterness kicks in towards the end, but the balance is definitely leaning to the sweet side. The alcohol is not well hidden and the mouthfeel is a bit syrupy. This beer improves towards the end, but it was a bit disappointing considering how highly it's rated."
"D: Lovely beer. And this growler is much better than I remember the bottles I have tried. Only limiting factor is the ABV you can taste after a few sips."
"This one smells like a great IIPA but tastes like an average barleywine. Still a nice balance going on, and it's certainly good to see an IIPA doing something with malt flavors as well as the hops."
"I love Avery and this is a nice beer but I was expecting a Wow, great beer. Not so much for me."
"Libation: Maharaja has such a good reputation, I was hoping to be blown away, but that didn't happen here. Don't get me wrong, it's a very, very good beer with enough hops to satisfy even the biggest hop heads, but the profile doesn't make me want to do anything more than sip. The double digit ABV doesn't help either. It's a very, very good beer, but just short of great."
"D: A very very good DIPA. Definitely in my top 5. Very strong and delicious smelling and even better tasting. The flavors and alcohol are bold and a bit rough around the edges, but this only takes away from its drinkability slightly. Definitely worth tracking down."
"Absolutely love the nose on this beer. Big grapefruit and lemon aroma with a bit of malt and maybe some other fruits. Definitely my favorite type of IIPA style. Tastes like it smells. Just a huge beer in terms of taste and alcohol content. The downside for me is that it lacks some of the smoothness that other IIPAs have."
"This is a monster beer right here, its lack of polish is appropriate and endearing. Will look forward to drinking this at least once a year."
"I'd been eying this at the store for months now, but a bit put off by the price. But, got it today and absolutely love it! A really great double IPA. Definitely _not_ a hop-bomb, this has a strong but very well-balanced flavor with little bitterness (and, indeed, it even has some welcome sweetness). The aroma is amazing too: the fresh pine-forest smell isn't at all like most IPAs with a pine-like smell... this smells like a real pine forest, not like Pine-Sol! A real treat, well worth picking up. I'll get more bottles of this for sure!"
"The beer pours an orange color with a large white head. The aroma is heavy on the pine and resin. The flavor is a mix of West Coast hops with some grapefruit, pine and resin notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a very dark amber colour, verging on brown. Thick white head with tons of lacing. Smell is of pine and citrus hops with a little bit of sweetness. Has a ton of sticky pine in the taste, with some citrus hop bitterness as well. Some sweetness of the malt to balance it out. Nice level of carbonation. One of my favourite double IPA's."
"D - If not for the ABV, I could drink this all day. Amazing bottled, even better fresh and on-tap, outstanding DIPA!"
"delicious, but drinkability is average at best. considering the abv, i doubt anyone could have more than one of these. i think i'm going to have to track down a fresher bottle of this and re-review it."
"D- it is drinkable but does come in a little on the sweet side. would be a perfect way to end the evening due to the sweet malty backbone. if you've not tried this one, run (don't walk) to a brew pub for a pint!"
"bottles."
"High carbonation with a near medium body and very creamy. Not as tongue drying as other DIPAs I have had. Overall a well crafted beer with a near excellent balance that I would definitely consider purchasing again."
"Comments: On 5-6-10, I opened a bottle designated as having been bottled on June 2009 - Batch 10. While it was similar, Batch 11 provided a nicer balance than that found in the previous batch."
"This is a good beer but I was expecting more. I need to hunt for a super fresh bottle."
"D: This is one of the best of my favorite style. Will drink it whenever I get the chance. Excellent!"
"I will probably buy this bad boy again when I want a 'wow' beer."
"Tasted from 22oz bottle, Batch 11. Pours a clear, amber-orange with an average but long-lasting beige head. Nose of caramel, grapefruit, lemongrass, and hops. The lemongrass really comes through strong on the front of the palate with the caramel in the middle, and bitter grapefruit hops on the back. The body is fairly big with lively carbonation and a long bitter, but balance finish. Overall, this beer is awesome. It is super balanced and the alcohol is masked nicely."
"Lotsss of Hops! Definitely not for the faint at heart. First thing you experience is the amazing hop aroma. Nice dark orange hoppy color and if your not prepared a kick in the face hop taste! If your drinking multiple beers Maharaja needs to be your last or you wont taste anything else. Def a must try for the hop heads out there, you wont be disappointed!"
"Poured into a New Belgium chalice crystal amber-orange with a two finger white head. Decent lacing and not head retention. Smells of strong hop presence. The taste has a nice strong sweet malt front that blends into a crisp hop bitters. Very interesting as I find most IIPA's don't follow this rule."
"D - Great! Apparently too much malt, too much hop, and too much alcohol come together to create a balanced beer. Very impressive."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer a lot and wish I had some more. I can see myself drinking this more often and not getting sick of it."
"Drinkability: Well, the end of each sip really shows off the 102 IBU's. I enjoy the flavor, but I wish the end wrapped up a little bit neater."
"While Maharaja is pretty unarguably a top 5 or at least a top 10 DIPA, the strange thing about it for me was that it's not very refreshing. Something about the combination of flavors was, to be a little repetitive from some of my other reviews, much less refreshing than it was interesting. I loved the depth of hop flavor, and the malt/hops balance was excellent... yet I would trade some of that big flavor for a solidly refreshing DIPA. Hard to quantify what that means, but that's my impression."
"D - At almost 11% its not the most drinkable beer but man this is a great beer. I could definitely have more then one of these."
"Kompai!"
"1-31-13: This years batch seems pretty consistent with previous ones. I am noticing an herbal/minty scent, and flavor that I do not recall. Also, the body seems a little lighter than I remember. I cant wait till the next batch."
"D - wonderfully done DIPA...no holds barred hop attack with an attempted balance. me likey."
"Pours cloudy orange with a large head which settle quickly. Lacing is light. There is a large hop aroma with plenty of pine, citrus, pineapple, grapefruit, mango, etc. Good carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Sweet bready malts balance the strong hops and heavy citrus pretty well. Finishes with medium bitterness. All and all a really good DIPA that I will seek out again."
"D: A solid DIPA that a pint every now and then would be great to enjoy"
"I really liked this beer but i wouldn't call it a pliny killer. Still it is a great beer and one that every fan of the style should try."
"Drinkability- very nice drinking and a beer that is just extremely hop bombed with tons of citrus flavored hops leaving a very long finish, the alcohol is not very noticeable except for slight warming, this is clearly a nicely made beer and for some people who absolutely crave a pure hop bomb with little malt side kick this maybe a knock out in drinkability but for me this just lacked a touch of balance to keep in check a touch of the boatload hops, worth a shot if you love lots hops, and to much just a bit to much to imagine ever having alot of this in night, sadly to my tastes quite off balance but unique"
"I feel that Maharaja gives PTE a run for its money. It is an amazing DIPA. PTE is enamel destroying but it just doesn't have the aromatics that Maharaja does. DIPA/IPA's do not get much better than this."
"D - A solid DIPA. This bomber is going down really easy..."
"Plenty of crisp carbonation keeps this one from weighing your mouth down, yet the hefty nature of this and the sweetness of the malt make this a no-more-than-one-bottle beer."
"This beer pours like a double IPA thick and hazy. The stench of hops followed the pour. It has a slight hop haze and after the pour a white fluffy head slowly dropped to a thin solid white head. This beer has a strong cat piss, pine like smell. Upon first sip I am hit by the intense hop flavor that moves through the mouth and ends in a mild bitter semi sweet flavor. Hop oil coated my mouth and I burbed hops after a few sips. This beer has a thick smooth mouthfeel that carries the hops smoothly. There is also excellent lacing that I have found loss in lesser examples of double and triple IPA'S. I am happy to be able to get this beer in central PA without trading; as this beer is a real treat for the hop head. Though the taste is unique it seems to land somewhere between Pliny the Elder and Hopslam. I have yet to have an Avery brew that impressed me and Maharaja lives up to what I expect from this brewer."
"Overall this really is one of the best DIPA's out there. I feel as though it chagnes a bit from batch to batch; however the best you can do is world-class and the worst you can do is great. Well, well worth a shot."
"Bomber of March 2010 batch. Poured a deep copper color with a big fluffy head and nice lacing. Smells fantastic, I could smell the hops from an arms length. Nice tropical fruit, dank nugs, piney..all the good things I want in a dipa. Very hoppy in taste with a massive amount of malty backing. Bit of sweetness to it. Dries your mouth out a bit with each sip. Thicker mouth feel with a really nice fresh flavor and good carbonation. Drinkability as far as taste is very good but the high 10.5% ABV in bomber size can limit you for sure. This beer is a beast when fresh and tastes much better than the previous bottles I have had with some age on them. Well done Avery. Recommended for sure."
"Plenty of crisp carbonation keeps this one from weighing your mouth down, yet the hefty nature of this and the sweetness of the malt make this a no-more-than-one-bottle beer."
"D - It's highly drinkable, until the alcohol hits, feel a slight warming in the stomach, and a nice buzz very quickly. This is a great beer. Truthfully, if it were rarer and more hyped I believe this would be a top 100 beer."
" This ale has big sticky lacing and fluffy near white head. Huge smells of orange, pineapple and mango all over the nose. Faint traces of alcohol and lime with mint. Grapefruit bitterness takes the center stage from the first sip. Afterglows of caramel and and orange peel follow revealing slightly the 10%+ ABV. The aromas and the taste differ quite a bit. I am reminded of Grand Marnier. Who needs after dinner drinks when we live so happily in the world of super DIPAs. I am finding that the large quaffs are just as good as the slow sips. The body is refreshing silky and thin. The carbonation is present but does not scrub the bitterness from the pallet before the next sip. I do love this brew and will be looking for this again. there are drawbacks on the drinkability when she clocks in over 10%. As with the Hopslam tread lightly the sweetness is a lie... you will feel the buzz."
"drinkability - i find it remarkabley drinkable for an IIPA"
"It is very drinkable. Overall, one of my favorite IPA's. Worth trying at least once!"
"drinkability - very complex and unique, a quite enjoyable IIPA, the flavor is delicious"
"Had this a number of times before, but this is probably the most notable. This is a real showcase of hops, but it retains a citrus and malt balance (despite what the east coasters say). Medium orange with a small head. Nose is pretty pleasant: pine, orange apricot, grapefruit. The real difference here with other IIPAs is the mouthfeel. VERY heavy. Maybe the heaviest mouthfeel of any hoppy beer I've had. Strong beer, this deserves to be on the BA 100. It's a crime that it's not."
"Pours a big coppery/dark orange color, with a good crown of foamy white head. Huge tropical fruit aromas on this one--passion fruit, mango, pineapple and bubble gum. Nice hoppy flavors are there, but this one is very malty as well. Creamy, with a good warming alcohol finish."
"I had very few expectations for this beer going in. Having said that, if you are reading this and plan to buy Maharaja, you may be underwhelmed. It reminded me of the first time I took a sip of Founder's Red's Rye, and made a double take while saying WOW! It's the best DIPA I've had in a while and worth seeking out."
"overall: really a great beer that I have heard is a lot like younger I have never had younger so this is the next best thing and its really very good."
"A very admirable Double/Imperial IPA that I would buy again. Would love to try this on tap."
"Pours a huge, whipped up head of three plus fingers, cream white, very fine microfoam which dimples here and there, curiously the lacing slides effortlessly down the glass insides without much stickiness. Bright amber orange color with a bit of red mixed in, noticeably clear, to the point you can spot just about every tiny bubble rising within. Boisterous nose of pine sap, tangerine and grapefruit juice, garden herbs, honey, malted milk balls and croissant flakes, the peach, apricot, yellow apple scents almost get shunted to the side and have a dried fruit character to boot. Medium-bodied, however, the """fluff factor""" from the swirling carbonation increases palate coverage and makes the mouth on the whole feel fuller. The tangerine, mineola orange, pink grapefruit fruit fest continues here. A veritable pine forest in there too. Never gets bitter but the fruit takes on a more tropical tang with pineapple, papaya seated besides the apricot and peach. White pepper, clove and ginger root there in shadowy form. Strong malty side, yet total sweetness tempered by grassy hops. Lacks fully adroit integration, too much of a showoff, but drinking it is not a chore."
"Medium to full bodied, oily, and nicely carbonated. The alcohol is well hidden for 10.41%. This is a very good DIPA, which I will seek out again."
"D: Only OK for the style."
"Overall this is one of the best DIPAs out on the market and once that deserves much praise. Avery has created a balanced beer that is sure to please fans of the style. Highly Recommended."
"Poured this puppy into my trusty Piraat tulip glass... deep orange / almost ruby with a nice white head that dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves chunky spots of snow white-lace on the glass. Smell is of hopped up tropical fruit syrup, pine and a little malt sweetness / brown sugar. Taste is hop-ridiculous... piney, tropical fruit, citrus and some heavy grapefruit rind; a little dry, herby finish with a touch of caramel malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick. A great DIPA that's quite enjoyable."
"D=Well balanced with a lot of complexity going on here. You want to go in for another sip. It does leave alot of bitter at the end which hopheads love but some might not like."
"Drinkability: Well balanced but strong!"
"This is a wonderful DIPA when fresh. Fantastic aroma and taste, very drinkable and amazing for the price as compared to the other top in the style."
"Quality DIPA and I cannot stress enough the importance of FRESHNESS (unless you like aged/boozy/smokey tasing beer when aged), this stuff is awesome fresh! One of the best I've had."
"Served cool with a hazy golden amber body and rocky, creamy light tan head. Smell was of fresh hops, extremely dank and pungent. Taste was very similar to bottled Maharaja, BUT, with an even more intense super fresh grapefruit flavor. The hops change to an herbal bitterness in the finish, very nice. Still a nice malt backbone to match up with the supreme hop flavors. Mouthfeel was super lush and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is good, though a single 12oz serving of this strong ale is plenty. Much better on cask than in the bottle. If you see this on cask, get it!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and flavorful and worthy of a lazy afternoon of relaxed sipping"
"M & D: Extremely smooth with a slick texture. Medium flavor duration. Heavy bitterness on the finish. But the front end sweetness of your next sip will help balance it out. This clever process ensures that the Maharaja will not last long in the glass. Somewhat dangerous considering the all-too-noticeable ten and a quarter ABV."
"D - Scary smooth for the 10% ABV. The complexity of the flavors keep you coming back for more but this is by no means a session beer, not even close. This is certainly one to end the night with as I doubt your palate would be able to recover from the experience quickly. Very enjoyable and a must try for any DIPA fan."
"Does remind me of Hog Heaven at times, which could be an indication of the subtle differences between a DIPA and a Barleywine. Avery is a solid brewery, and this beer only reenforces that."
"Notes-Tasty, quite tasty; if you like sweeter DIPAs you should love this."
"Overall, I just have never been able to enjoy this one. Looks like nothing has changed. I know the style doesn't demand it, but there is no hint of balance at all here. Sorry Avery this is my last re-visit to your flagship DIPA."
"There is a lot to like in this beer. I am liking it since my favorite style is Belgian IPA. The fruit flavors are here along with the highly concentrated hop bitters. On my list of the very best Imperial IPAs. Drink in moderation!"
"D-The alcohol and thickness make this a hard beer to drink a lot of. Really nice aroma with a decent flavor. Maybe dry it out a bit, or not. Still good."
"drinkability: very solid DIPA, highly recommend and would seek out again"
"I'm in to this beer. This is pretty much everything I wanted from my DIPAs."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very pleasant especially considering the abv and hops. Drinkability is a 4 but that's as good as you can get for this much of an ass kicking beer."
"My only quip with this beer did not hide its alcohol content well; mind you, I enjoy a warming beer, but the booze bite on this one is a bit much."
"Overall a hell of a beer great work Avery!"
"D - A bomber of this is perfect, this is not a beer you are going to session or drink too much of. It is not refreshing and is a bit challenging, but you will enjoy the challenge."
"Less malt please. Otherwise, this would be a great one."
"The mouthfeel was slightly disappointing becuase I thought it would be incredible but fell slightly short. It is great none the less. Leaning toward the verge of being too syrupy, it is full bodied, mouth coating, and slick. I use the word nectar when describing great hoppy DIPAs such as this, and I don't think I could think of a more suiting word for a beer along these lines. Probably one of the more enjoyable DIPAs I've had lately. I've been looking out for a while ,and Maharaja, we shall meet again before you depart for the year."
"Leaves for a chewy mouthfeel downbottle. Big on the bitterness throughout. Alcohol feel is minimal. Great burps. Expensive. . ."
"Overall: A delicious, decadent treat and extremely drinkable for such a big beer. This is a hophead's dream."
"One of my favorite double IPAs. Really enjoyed this beer."
"Mouthfeel is great - low carb from the cask but very nice body. So drinkable, allowing all the flavors to shine. A great beer from Mr. Adam Avery's kick-ass brewery."
"D: Super smooth and malty DIPA; loads of sweetened caramel malts combined with a subtle sweet bitterness which allows the 10.24% ABV to fly under the radar. A very good aperitif or a brew to go before your spicy veggie burger with cajun onion rings."
"Answer - Maharaja. One of the worst beers I have ever had."
"i was expecting to be exhausted by this beer, but wasn't. the balance is great and the bitterness/alcohol are never overwhelming. awesome."
"D- The flavor and aroma are great, but this beer lays a bit heavy on the stomach. It's so deliciously bitter though."
"Drinkability is superb, I have waited a long time to try this beer fresh and it was definitely worth it."
"Overall, a very awesome IIPA. Huge bodied with a massive amount of hops (obviously). Pretty drinkable. I dig it. The aroma is amazing."
"D. This is an Imperial IPA done right! While not a session beer by any stretch, I can't wait to have another... perhaps tomorrow. I'd like to cellar a few and see how it changes."
"D: I was very pleased by this beer. I had it back when I first started getting into beer and wasn't impressed (very likely an old bottle), but this is really a great DIPA and very easy to drink."
"D: 1/2 bottle was just right."
"Overall, fresh or not, this is a good beer. I'll have to pick up another bottle from another store to compare to find out if this was fresh or not, but judging by others reviews I'll bet this is older. Still a good beer, though."
"d - I liked this DIPA a lot. I thought there was a nice combination of citrusy hops and sweet malts that created a nice smooth taste that's easy to drink. Would definitely try again."
"D: A bit big to drink more than one of, even by IIPA standards."
"pours a gorgeous, hazed amber. """that's pretty""" -my gf compliments for behind my shoulder. my thoughts exactly. two finger pearl head that almost completely dissipates after about three minutes with great lace. the aroma is earthy, with grapefruit hops up front and then very nicely balanced with some caramel malt. a bit fruity and pleasing. the taste is east coast and comforting. mellow malt, tangy hops, and fruity pebbles. it is at this moment, that i am thinking (and thanking) about the second bottle in my fridge. creamy, velvet texture. thanks again kevin. i could drink these all day."
"D: To start I liked the way that maharaja isn't about specifically showing off a hoppy bitterness. There is much more involved then sucking your tongue out your face. Also, with a 10.69% abv, I would have thought the alcohol (though also appreciated) would have drowned me out a bit... It didn't. Its not to be taken lightly, but not feared at all. I liked it a lot and in many ways solidified my good opinion of Avery in stone. A great try and recommend snagging one. For those out there wanting to match food, I had maharaja with a dank roasted turkey sandwich with some biting jack cheese, made it all the better."
"22 oz. bomber bottled June 2009, Batch 10. Sweet, sweet malt aroma fills the room the second the bottle is opened. There's some piney hops in the nose as well but you really have to concentrate to distinguish them from that huge malt aroma. Pours bright orange with a thick and sticky white head that laces beautifully if you can manage to drink that much of it. Body is medium full with significant carbonation that combines to produce quite a pleasant sensation on the palate. It's just so cloyingly sweet. There's a considerable hop presence but it has no chance at all of competing with the malt. Tastes a lot like fresh unfermented wort. The malt profile is really pretty complex but I just can't get past the sweetness enough to enjoy it. The label claims an OG of 1.090 and ABV of 10.69% so, without actually breaking out the hydrometer, the FG should be about 1.007. I just don't buy that for a second. It's far too sweet to have finished that dry. I've heard really good things about this beer so I'm hoping this is just a bad batch. It's going to take a long time before I try this one again."
"Overall- the hop smell and the taste really are different. the high 10%abv is pretty well hidden. i say pick it up but nothing for the crazy hop heads like myself."
"D - Alcohol is well masked and the beer is well balanced making for one highly drinkable brew. Well done!"
"Pours a murky golden brown color with a creamy off-white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of tropical fruit hops and some grapefruit. There is also a sweet aspect to the aroma, honey or brown sugar. The taste is of bitter grapefruit rinds, piney hops, some resin. This is followed by a sweet malt that does a good job supporting the hop flavor and enhancing the citrusy and floral aspects of the hops. There is some tropical fruit sweetness in this brew. Moderate body with tingly carbonation; sweet throughout but finishes bitter, light asprin dryness. The ABV can produce some belly burn from time to time. Very tasty brew. I like that it showcases the hop flavors instead of the bitterness. The sweetness is well balanced with the hops. The ABV limits this sucker to one 12oz."
"D: Much more in the English IPA vein with a heavy maltiness. Enjoyable for one round, certainly appreciated."
"For a big double the nose is a fooler. I bought this one at Total Wine and I thought here's another spoiled beer again. But.... I was wrong the first sip and everything was most definitely right. IMO a very complex mixture of flavors, you get some fruity. citrus notes, some earthy tones too. Most in this style group tend to go one way or the other, but this one did both. Nicely bitter, and for a big double not really very sweet, but just enough to temper the punch in the face ABV, and surprisingly not hot. If I didn't know the ABV I never would have guessed it to be that high. A great Double from Avery by any measure. It gets knocked down a little on the nose, but that's being picky I suppose, and the 10+ ABV kills some drink ability, but that's not really a deterrent, you just have to be respectful."
"I really liked this one - its tropical character reminded me of masala mama, and it was a nice drinkable double IPA. I love this style!"
"Not much aroma from an IMPERIAL IPA, but that is OK., the beer rebounds in strong fashion The appearance of this beer is beautiful. Light at the narrow bottom of my glass and dark at the top. Picture perfect! This is a TRUE beer. No sweetness, no fruit, just a lot of hops. There is plenty bitterness to start and I'm sure it will scare off the weak but if you can hand around long enough you'll enjoy the lingering flavor. One of the best IPAs I've had and certainly one of the best beers out of Avery."
"D: You'd expect something that knocks you off your chair at almost 11% ABV but this beer is very, very drinkable. I have two 10 oz. glasses and could have handled at least 1 more. I followed this up with a Surly Furious that seemed excessively bitter compared to the Maharaja (and I love Furious). While not sessionable, I'd highly recommend Avery Maharaja especially if you can get it on tap."
"Plenty of crisp carbonation keeps this one from weighing your mouth down, yet the hefty nature of this and the sweetness of the malt make this a no-more-than-one-bottle beer. Thanks Bobsy!"
"D- For 102 IBU, pretty drinkable."
"Awesome. This is a great double IPA, I could drink this all the time."
"I've got to say, the Imperial IPA style is a nice change of pace, and if the rest of it is in the league of this beer then count me as a fan."
"When aged for over a year, hoppiness diminishes somewhat, different flavor but still excellent."
"D-drinks great as an american barleywine! really wanna try one fresh!"
"Drinkability: A top notch DIPA. Not too heavy on the malt, plenty of hop character, and just enough booziness to remind you that you are drinking a """big beer""". As much as I would like to, I don't think I could drink more than one of these in an evening...though with a brew as tasty as this it would certainly be worth a try."
"Poured from the 22 oz. bottle (bottled June 2009 - Batch 10) into a pint glass, Maharaja is an apricot-honey color with a huge pillowy hop-froth head that leaves a nice ring of lacing about the glass. The smell is huge; I can smell it from 2 feet away, citrus dominates in the form of grapefruit, orange and lemon - some resinous pine in there also. The taste starts malty sweet with caramel and lightly toasted notes and transitions into a slightly bitter pine slap across the face. The beautiful thing about Maharaja is that there is no lingering face-puckering bitterness, it is very well balanced. Also although the alcohol is 10.69%, you might guess it is elevated but not to that level, also well done. The mouthfeel is full bodied and slick, slightly drying on the finish but not a desert like some beers. Overall, very drinkable given the IBUs and ABV. Definitely a good DIPA, pick it up if you have the chance."
"It's amazing that Avery has crafted two of the best DIPA's available (at least in my area), as both Maharaja and Dugana are simply excellent. While Dugana is more of hop-bomb, Maharaja is one of the most balanced - and best flavored - DIPAs I've come across."
"Serving: Bomber"
"Quite heavy and very potent like the Czar from Avery. An excellent DIPA. I have a hard time finishing a bomber by myself. Great for getting plastered if thats what you are after, but prolly better suited to share with a friend."
"D- I find this beer so tasty I could attempt to drink it all night. Unfortunately I know the high ABV would quickly catch up with me. I guess I'll limit myself to a single bomber on week nights, but on a Friday or Saturday I can see myself enjoying several of these bottles of hoppy goodness! Highly reccommended!"
"Somewhat disappointed in this, after hearing all the raves. A good DIPA but not one I'd reach for often."
"Whoa nelly, big dipa in my belly, dank and smelly to tell ya. Malt comes through on nose with pinapple spice so nice. Grounded and earthy foundation, not flitty fruity without support, nice legs. Bit of nougat in the center of the aroma that is so inviting. Resinous, candied hops on a simple but hefty malt bill. Thick vanilla, cookie and bitter, caramel and fruit. This is excellent, a solid corner of the DIPA offerings. This one holds its own on balance, not my favorite, but my bet as a serious contender."
"Cloudy orange topped by a mountain of white fluffy head. Awesome hop aroma with deep citrus notes and cream. Citrus flavors, hop bitterness, huge hop flavor. Creamy mouthfeel with a heavy body. Alcohol is there but not too oppressive. One of the kings of the IIPA's."
"This one benefits from allowing it to warm to the 50 - 55 degree range."
"Picked this up on a recommendation, REALLY glad I did. Got the duganA while I was there, but it was even sharper and brighter with less of a quenching aftertaste (my tasting notes call it """the granny smith of IPAs"""). They warned me that Maharaja > duganA...I guess they know their stuff!"
"D: A very interesting dIPA. Unique, for sure. The guy I bought it from said it's his favorite of all time. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I'll definitely give it several more shots to make its case."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts - This beer was fantastic! I personally would probably only consume 1 pint or 2 before it just became to overpowering, but when your in the mood for an assault of floral & pungent hops, than this is definitely the fix! I really enjoyed the slightly different fruity notes in the smell, and although the hops are big in the taste, it seemed to balance out more as it warmed, offering mild but definitely noticeable malty flavors. I will have to have this one again for sure, and I definitely recommend it. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: excellent example of a DIPA. will be drinking this one again, and soon."
"D - This beer had a lot going for it, but I the hop profile was a little off, this beer had great potential to be awesome, but this is still a good beer"
"Not as hop extreme as many DIPAs, this has a good balance, big malt as well as big hops. More in the vein of Dogfish 90 than some of the West Coast IIPAs."
"For some reason had been delaying on testing this one out - haven't been blown away by many of Avery's brews, although I have had a couple good ones. In any case, this one knocked me right on my ass. Really delicious, huge DIPA flavor. Pour is a lighter yellow than I expected, with a fairly weak head and no real lacing. Aromas and taste are huge - tons of citrus hoppiness, spice, and then a solid malt backbone. Warming, but no other hints of the 10% ABV in this one. A big fan, would pick up again in a second."
"Slight sense of citrus in the smell, but nothing over the top (though with DIPA's, over the top is usually what I go for). On tasting, has a relatively heavy complexion, and a slight sense of alcohol. Hops are evident, but not overpowering. Leans more towards being a balanced DIPA. While I still enjoyed it, I really doubt I could do more than one at a sitting. I would place it in what I consider the middle tier of DIPA's.... wouldn't tell any hop lovers to not get it (especially since price point is reasonable), but there are probably 10 other DIPA's i'd get before it."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle marked """Bottled in June 2009""" into a tumbler it forms a cappuccino head that clings to the glass. The appearance is light amber and cloudy. The aroma is strongly of citrus hops. The taste is strong and bitter with spicy hops and sweet with malts and a hint of orange. The feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a clean finish. Have mercy, but this one packs a wallop."
"D - Fair and definitely worth exploring more."
"CHEERS!!"
"22oz bomber pours a dark copper orange, with the very slightest of haze. I had a lot of foam in this one, had to let it sit a bit. So maybe this was a older bottle. Very balanced and had more of a malty taste to it, with some hops. Very smooth overall and quite easy to drink. Had no problem finishing off this bomber myself. Even had a nice little buzz after it. Very solid beer."
"Nice big body, and a very smooth drinker. Just barely a touch of alcohol, enough to remind you it's there. Oily, slick texture. Ridiculously easy to drink for a 10%+ ABV DIPA...a little less sweetness, and I'd be tempted to give it a 5."
"The color, which is a deep gold, and the aroma are both very good. If you like alcoholy beers, try this one."
"the finish is long and enjoyable with a full body and a firm bitterness that lets you know """hey i'm an imperial!""" a truly great beer as is everything that comes through avery's doors and i wouldn't think twice before throwing back another of these!"
"Batch 9, bottled in Feb. 2009. Poured into Unibroue tulip from 22 oz. bomber. Head starts one inch tall, then begins imploding from the inside out like there is an effing hop circus happening just above the body. Aroma is of pine, grapefruit and other citrus with some sweet malts in the background, maybe emerging more than usual due to the 8 month age of the bottle. Taste is hop juiciness to the n'th degree. Amazingly easy to drink with an ABV over 10! A hopstravaganza in the mouth and nose (and now in my belly) and kept in check by a nice malt bill. Awesome."
"D- Man am I glad that I found growler fill of this out here in NYC. I love the west coast IPA's & IIPA's alot, I think this one stands up, and surpasses many of them. I really enjoy Avery's offerings in general, but really, really enjoy this one."
"Perhaps not quite as good as the bottled version but still a top notch elite Imperial IPA in my opinion... I love this beer and I'm glad I got to try it on tap finally.."
"D - High Abv. Might be much for newbies."
"Drinkability: Very good balance of hops and smoothness."
"Really a tasty ipa reminds me a bit of dogfish heads efforts. the sweet malt balances out the grapefruit flavors nicely. top notch. i am truly surprised at the 102 ibu rating on the bottle I've had lower ibus that didn't seem this sweet."
"glassware: pint"
"Wonderful beer couldn't get enough of it all night(had 3)"
"Appearence is a deep copper color with some slight cloudiness. There is nice lacing on the edges as well. Aromas of citrus, pine, and malt are outstanding. Overall taste is slightly sweet and citrusy. There is a nice malt background to it as well. Overall this a great DIPA. Great hop notes and a fine slick texture. Classic DIPA feel and taste."
"Dark honey color with a picture perfect off white head that leaves plenty of lacing around the glass. Nose is swarming with hops and malt, but it's a little biting. Could use a little more depth in the aroma. Taste is everything I want in a double ipa. Extremely well balanced between biting hops, and a sweet slab of caramel malt. This beer is perfectly married! Mouthfeel is medium bodied yet crisp, and not overly chewy like some double ipa's. Feel definitely leads to the overall drinkability getting a perfect score. Highly drinkable and hard to put down."
"Some people really dig this big bold DIPA but it always seems overly heavy on alcohol, sweetness, and malt to me. Not to mention at around 10 bucks a bomber where I usually find it in CA I feel like I've given this beer a fair chance but don't plan on buying any more of this. A decent DIPA but for the price point I'd much rather get a 6-pack of Odell's or Racer 5. Hell I can get 2 bombers of Just Outstanding for the same price and I'd say its also twice as good."
"D: This beer is a drinkable beer. They serve it in a 1 pint 6 oz. bottle. Good beer to share with a friend or you brother! wesbrownyeah approved."
"D- For a beer of this magnitude I would love to find it on tap and sip pint after pint night after night. Wonderfully done brew, too bad I bought it in North Carolina and live in Florida. Would love to keep a few around."
"From notes. Labeled """Batch 9, Feb 09""". I've admired this one for a few years. Pours clear, light amber, thick white head with good retention and lacing. Active. SMELL is grapefruity hops and a strong malty base hitting first. A very rich and robust aroma, not overly complex but it hits the spot. TASTE Medium hop bitterness blending with big caramel maltiness, citrusy and floral hop flavors, and obvious booze. Rich, complex, and balanced. Bitterness returns for the finish but is not overdone. FEEL ful, thick, rich and viscous texture. Alc warming, with drying bitter finish. OVERALL I have no trouble finishing a 22. A big, yummy treat. One of the best in its class, in my view."
"WOW! Now this is my idea of a balanced, full bodied, satisfying IPA. Sweet, bitter, powerful, and delicious. A memorable brew and a new favorite for me. Without a doubt, a huge beer, formidable at 10.69%, but I'd crack a second one now if I had it without hesitation. Perhaps a little pricey for frequent consumption, it's worth every penny as a now and then treat when it's available."
"Red/orange haze, sticky lacing with a thin head. smells of the usual citruisy orange hops, oily, a bit of a chewey bready malt in there. Taste is good. Buttery smooth hoppy bitterness, citric/piney as to be expected... Hops dominating but with some toasted/bready malt backbone. Carbonation is on the heavy side and alcohol is warming but not overwhelming. This one is great.. but might not be a first choice amongst pricey DIPA bombers.. But definitely worth it. Drinkability.. well its a high abv 10.7%..so one is enough. gnarly"
"Drinkability: This is delicious, but a bomber by myself is stretching it."
"D - fairly drinkable. easier to quaff with some alimentations. I'd consider myself a bit of a hophead and this is one of the better IIPAs in my (limited) experience."
"D: Powerful beer but then its a 10+ abv beer but I enjoyed the pint and felt like more."
"D - over 10? shananigans! this brew is excessively hopped without ever being too much -compliments of the highly sweet and satisfying malts. this is extreme beer at it's finest. this one can rule over me any day of the week. i just wish it was year around."
"poured into my duvel glass. pours a copper/orange color with a thick 1 inch head, very good lacing throughout. nice piney grapefruit aroma, big citrus hop aroma too. taste is big and strong, nice hop grapefruit taste. fucking delicious. bitter to the end. awesome ipa."
"Intensely bitter and hop forward with a blast of dry piney floral hops with hints o citrus lemon peel, grapefruit and pineapple. While it is sweet, there are still some earthy dry sticky dank pine notes. With all of the hops there is a decent malt backbone that provides a small bit of balance. Slight alcohol presence but the ABV is still very well masked making this dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability is poor, perhaps due to suspected outdatedness. It will be a struggle to finish this 22 oz.'er."
"D) worth the $8. could drink a lot of this."
"Mouthfeel is creamy but chewy. Carbonation is adequate, but not over the top. The smoothness lends itself to a decent drinkability."
"This is a supremely hoppy, citrusy, complex beer that will linger on your pallet's memory for ages."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Grapefruit nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is almost sweet grapefruit, some malts in background, lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. Decent DIPA. Bottled Jun 2009. $7.99 for a 22oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Love the carbonation, it dances. Leaves the mouth feeling dry, and an aftertaste of grapefruit and hops. I'll have another!"
"Amber/orange color with some haze. Creamy off-white head. Had this about a month ago and failed to review it. Got one last night as a gift and, remembering the taste, held off about 20 minutes before succumbing to opening it. Grapefruit and pineapple followed then by pine...I love my hops. I seem to get a hint of malt smell, but very little. Taste is much of the same. Sticky pine, pineapple, along with a nice sensation of alcohol. There is a hint of malt, but as far as """balanced," I don't know if I'd go that far. The thing is, that's the point of this beer for me. When I have a DIPA/IIPA, I'm not looking for a perfectly balanced beer. I want big hops and big alcohol. I dig this one."
"On tap at The Happy Gnome. Wow, this is so much better than out of the bottle. The biggest difference for me was the alcohol. On tap it is undetected. Nice deep burnt orange color with tons of sticky lace. Nice crisp citrus with lots of pineapple finishing with straight pine. Nice malt backbone to balance it out. Big and smooth as hell. So tasty and easy to drink. Great all around DIPA."
"D - Well this one was bottled in February so i haven't tried it obviously superfresh but great none the less and would not mind another."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Nice amber/orange hue, with a decent head that seemed to lace well. The smell had subtle hints of pineapple and passion fruit as well as some woodiness, but it was all overpowered by pink grapefruit to the point where if I closed my eyes, I'd have swore that I had my beak in a glass of Tropicana. The flavor was more subtle than the nose in terms of the grapefruit; certainly more balanced, and more evidence of malty/molasses sweetness. However the finish devolves into as sweet, and not-so-subtle alcoholic burn. Admittedly, this is where I differ from most of the other reviews on BA; the bottle I had (maybe a bad batch?) seemed to have too much burn for my taste. I wouldn't use the 10% abv as an excuse, as I have had Dbl IPAs just as strong where the burn is non-existent. The mouthfeel was nicely balanced; a little creamy. The drinkability is slightly above average."
"D- Tasty and pretty drinkable for a big high ABV DIPA. Good MF keeps it going smooth."
"The 10% or so is clearly felt throughout--this brew is probably designed to be bigger than life and a once in a while treat."
"D - Decent for the type, but the lack of balance and wear on the palate limit wanting to seek it out."
"D - This is a heavy, thick DIPA and despite its huge flavors, it is balanced enough to remain relatively quaffable. This beer is full of pungent hops, especially in the aroma, but it is one of the few examples of the style that is just as much about malt as hops and bitterness. The rich toffee and caramel not only balance the hops and preserve drinkability, but also add complexity and make for an excellent drinking experience."
"D-Given the high ABV it is very drinkable. The alcohol is not very noticable so this one could sneak up on you after a few."
"This is easily one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Its got just about everything. Citrus, pine, grass, bitterness, dry finish, complexity. Easily in the top 5 IPAs I have ever had, this is one to revisit often. It also ages surprisingly well as the hop character remains there, even after a year or so. Worth checking out again and again. Excellent."
"This is a good tasting Imperial IPA, but it is a little too citrusy for my tastes. But the nice thing is that the taste masks a strong beer. I am glad that I tried this beer however I probably will not try this one again. There are too many Imperial IPA's out there to settle on just one!"
"Avery Maharaja has a wonderful look and balance of sweet and bitter. It's like a meal and dessert rolled into one."
"Glad I finally got around to trying this. I'll probably grab it again when I am really need a hop fix."
"Will purchace this one again, this and Hog Heaven are in my top 10 beers."
"Drinkability - Just the bomber, this is one that could be shared, its not too heavy, but it is just heavy enough where one is enough."
"Drinkability: Impressive for the ABV"
"Drinkability: I am personally starting to like the hoppier IPA's but there weren't too many profiles of hop to make me want another on the same night."
"D - Hop bomb, high gravity. A good sipper, but not very sessionable IMHO."
"Has a great crisp feel in the mouth, clean with just enough lingering from the hops. It would be easy to drink a lot of these except for the 10%ABV. The alchohol does not get in the way of the flavors, but will sneak up on you. Overall one of my new favorite IPAs."
"Pours a cloudy, amber/copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol up front, then hops, sweet malt background, slight pine, and slight citrus. Overall, a great blend, body, and drinkability for such a high abv."
"D - Pretty smooth for 10.69%. I don't pick up any alcohol in the flavor."
"Pours a nice hazy orange color. Thin and sticky head. Smell is sharp and hoppy with hints of pine and citrus. Flavor is piney, but more specifically sappy. There is a strong and lingering grapefruit taste. Citrusy on the front and full-bodied with hardly bitterness at all. Lingers in front but little finish in back. A fantastic beer."
"A flavorful and rich IPA. While there is a lot of hoppy bitterness it fades away really smoothly. There is a spicy feel to the beer that is probably a combination of the hops and alcohol. The syrupy sweetness is actually what makes this beer hard to drink a lot of."
"Very good body that coats the tongue nicely without being too clingy. Dangerously drinkable, this ImpIPA can be had repeatedly. Worth seeking out."
"This guy is over 10% and it lets you know. There is some faint alcohol warmth that lingers. A sipper, but one that is hard to put down."
"A: Deep gold to brown tea colored, thick rocky head with some sticky lacing along the edge of the glass, crystal clear on the first pour but noticeable sediment on the bottom of the bottle - 4.50, S: Loads of earthy & citrusy hops with a smattering of pine, definite pungency to the nose, there is also a solid showing from tropical fruits such a pineapple and possibly passion fruit, though hops take center stage the malts are also evident and alcohol is obvious - 4.00, T: Extremely piney, some sticky sweetness on a heavy malt base, definite warming on the noticeable alcohol - 4.00, M: Full-bodied and creamy - 4.50, D: A solid interpretation of a double IPA, the high alcohol pushes it a touch outside of the drinkable range though that won't stop me from continuing to enjoy Maharaja - 4.00"
"D - Considering the high ABV, this is a very drinkable brew. I really like the intense hop flavors in this one, and it manages to maintain a balance as well. Caution is warranted, as this one goes down dangerously smooth and easy for 10.69%."
"pours a hazy copper color with a nice head that dissipates to a nice 1/4 creamy beige head till end.the smell is a hop bomb that is grapefruit, hop, pine, grass, and malt i also smell alcohol...the taste is a tongue heater it hits in you face with hops, grapefruit and sweet malts and again that alcohol taste which detracts from the overall balance of this dipa.the mouth feel is robust and full with sticky oily hop resins but with a alcohol burn that i do not like in dipa's .this one is a good dipa and one that i will recommend but not as balanced or in the same league as dread naught ,double trouble,pliney,or hopslam..if this was tweaked a little and balanced out this would be an a-plus..still recommended of course"
"Had a pint of this tastiness at South Park Tavern. Poured in a standard pint glass, it didn't have too much head retention but had some good lacing. The body was golden amber and translucent. The aroma on this is powerful. Lots of grapefruit, melon, and citrusy hops. There was a weird faint note of strawberry!?! The 3C hops are also powerful in the taste with some orange rind and I know there's some malt in there somewhere but the hops overpower it. This beer has staying power, really coats the mouth with bitterness and just hangs out there. Someone posted a thread about a drinkability theory, if you start drinking it and HOLY CRAP it's almost gone, that equals good drinkability. That was the case with this one, sucked it down. Yum."
"heavy balanced dangerous mouth destroyer."
"Taste: Quite a bit of pine, but not overwhelmingly piney. Finishes with a minty flavor. I've never experienced so much mint in a DIPA before, and I really like it."
"Had this one the other day after work. Poured a hazy orange copper color with offwhite head that faded slow and left good lacing. Smelled of citrus hops and light malt. Tasted of alcohol up front with very balanced malt and hop flavors. Very smooth. Definitely in my top IIPAs now, would probably be my favorite if the alcohol was masked a little better."
"This is a top tier imperial IPA. I've had this on tap as well and it's even better in draft."
"This is a very good and drinkable IPA. This is actually my """go to""" IPA and """regular""" beer when I just want something that I know is good and it goes with all sorts of food!"
"D - Halfway through the bottle I'm thinking I could drink this all day... then as I get toward the end the ABV starts to hit me and I realize that as much as I want one more, this is going to be it. Until tomorrow?"
"Bitterness is so numbing I have a hard time describing mouthfeel. As it gets towards room temp, it feels a bit sticky. Drinkability is about what you expect. High ABV so it gets better towards the end of the bottle."
"Poured dark amber with a cloudy hue and a thick single-finger head which receded to the rim of the glass after a few minutes. Could definitely taste the hops, but a sweet caramel malty flavor made its way through backed by a distinctly boozy aftertaste. I guess some IIPAs mask it (out hop-it) better than others, but not a problem! Mouthfeel was very smooth, moderate carbonation and excellent drinkability. Moreover a great enticing taste! No problem killing a bomber of this (but only one... 10.5% ABV) and a brew I'd definitely recommend."
"D: Very easy to drink if you are into the really hoppy beers. Because of the 10%+ ABV, it can be a bit dangerous too. A bit more than I'm used to, but would gladly have it again."
"Drinkability: I had no idea this was 10.3% til after I finished it with Freddy. Would've guessed 8.5-9. Delightful to have such an intense beer finish less-so. Definitely a hop-bomb with little balance, but very fun for what it is."
"Tastes of orange initially, fading into an radically bitter pine-tree, almost of unripened juniper berries. Mouthfeel is dry, makes my taste buds desire water over more of this beer, the beer's greatest downfall in my opinion. I struggle to drink it because of the lingering balsam-juniper taste which I feel is uncomplimentary to the initial fruity flavor."
"I'm really sorry guys, i know i should think this is a god beer but i don't. it was highly recommended by my bartender. It tatsed like pine sap to me. Other than that it was a pretty good beer, but it was to hard to get past this taste for me. I've had other, more balanced tasting IPAs that didn't hit me over the head with pine taste. i prefer more citrus than pine."
"D: A drinkable beer. Has a big ABV%, but is still easy to drink."
"Pours out with a thick whitish-bubbly head and lots of lacing. The color is clear and crisp orange/tan. Smell is mild and mostly of bitter and citrus, but with a sweet hint as well. The taste starts out pretty sweet, then there's some nice malt character that is often missed in these strong IPAs. The finish is hints of citrus and bitter hops, and a twinge of alcohol. The aftertaste is mainly of those bitter hops. Good drinkability - a little rough in the later tastes on the mouthfeel, just because of the alcohol taste, but it's to be expected at this high ABV. Good stuff."
"This brew was found at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul, MN. Poured cold in a tulip glass this beauty shows a light copper, clear and glowing with a fair off-white head and decent cascading lace. The aroma emits a pronounced but tasteful grapefruit, somewhat floral at times with a sweet bread base. The flavor is tart cider pine with full malt earthiness. It borders on the bubblegum edge but instead reaches into that hard grain core to keep you grounded and blissful. As you go you pick up some peanutty touches and evident alcohol to warm you up a bit. It's full bodied, lightly but confidently carbonated and smooth as can be. The bitter hops hold the highlight here, becoming even more pronounced as you go. Drinkability would seem marginal based on alcohol but it is a wonderful taste sensation. Very grainy, tart and good!"
"Overall this brew is amazing, my first flirt with the DIPA and I am in love now and it is my favorite style. Very nice IPA here, get some if you can."
"Somewhere between copper and amber, clear with a soapy 2 finger cream colored head, fades to half inch. Smell: first whiff is all tropical fruit - pineapple, papaya, passion fruit. A toasty and caramel sweetness that goes well with sweet fruits. Pine, spruce, and mineral notes. Taste: sweet with a big piney, raw, leafy flavor. Canned pineapple mix of sweet and acidity. There's seems to be a little citric rind down in there too. Smooth and sticky with a healthy dose of the ibu. Mercilessly drags you to the intersection of pine and pineapple road, it's a nice place to be. A nice fresh June 2009 Batch 10. By the end of the bomber it's time to bump the rating up a bit for that wonderful piney dance on the tongue and the ability to light one's breath afire."
"D- Hop heads will enjoy this one. Its balanced, but lacks in mouthfeel however it's got balls with the 10.24% ABV."
"The beer never quite comes together to a coherent whole and I wish that some of the more complex citrus hop flavors were allowed to shine a bit more, but there's a lot to explore in this beer and it's definitely worth trying. Sidenote: the malt complexity here makes me think that this may be one of those rare DIPAs that becomes almost like a good barleywine when aged. Time for a little experiment..."
"J"
"I only had an 8 oz. pour, cause it was an outrageous 8$ for 10oz. But it was awesome and I wanted to drink more. I will keep my eye out for you Maharaja! And if you are fresh, I will buy you and drink you!"
"Not too strong, alcohol is there but not overwhelming."
"This is a wonderfully complex beer. Much more going on than the standard floral/grapefruit in many offerings of the style. Be careful, the alcohol is well-hidden in this one, and hits you hard if you're not careful."
"Cheers!!!"
"The beer was poured a red hazy color with a white head. The aroma was most definitely Amarillo or similar hops. The taste was sweet, sticky, and of course hoppy. There were some spicy notes as well. Also detected a yeast flavor, and the warming sensation from the alcohol. Very lovely."
"Drinkability - This is a great Imperial IPA. Nothing overwhelms anything else in this perfectly balanced beer. Exceptional!"
"Smell off the bottle is definitely hoppy with a grapefruit smell. Poured a dark golden color in wine glass which is the only clean glass I have at the moment. The taste is definitely hoppy like a double IPA should be. Nice. Mouthfeel fills the whole mouth with a tingly sensation with a good alcohol back end. Drinkability is take your time sipping this beer. Good on a warm summer day/evening. I'll throw in Winter too."
"Cloudy amber-orange pour with very visible sediment and a decent fluffy thick head that held at about one ince for the whole glass. Laced decently but not evenly. One bottle tasted like an Ale even but for the most part this is a great very hops-driven and some citrus IPS true-and-through. On the nose it is identical and unremarkable for a double but great overall. Good solid carbonation and a meal sort of density to it. Very good beer if you get a good bottle but like other Avery's I've had it's been inconsistent for me."
"D) Good. Obviously it's a DIPA, and I do love my IPAs. But even for me it's a *bit* too bitter. But it's a pleasure to have one of these over the course of 30-45 minutes or so, and I definitely felt the buzz after a short while. No need for a 2nd one but it was a pleasure."
"Big ABV! Wow! But the taste hides it quite well. I will be buying more. Looks spectacular in a glass and the head is nice to look at as well. I would prefer the beer if it were slightly more crisp and clean. There is a slight aftertaste that agrees with my palate for the most part but its just a tad to sweet. After a third of the bottle goes down though you get quite warmed up to the flavors and its an overall excellent Imperial.Great contender in the DIPA category and the bottle is friggin sweet! Get it if you see it if you don't see it go find it!"
"Very drinkable for a 10.5%. Had zero alcohol bite to it. Fantastic DIPA overall."
"Despite having some age on it my bottle of Maharaja was pretty good. I'd love to see how intense the fruit flavors and the IBUs are in a fresher bottle."
"The carbonation seemingly forces the hops into the gums, which are soon comfortably numb while swimming in hoppy oils. I am beginning to sense the power of the Maharaja, yet on a good night I am beginning to believe that I could down two of these marvels."
"A superb Imperial IPA and a showcase for the power of American hops. Powerful and powerfully delicious, but probably a bit too much for more than one."
"This is a strong flavor hops beer but no where over the top is hoppyness. Well done guys."
"D: Pretty good for the style. I had no problem polishing off the bomber."
"D: This brew is big and strong. I can't wait to try the freshest batch!"
"I wish my bottle was a bit fresher as I could tell the malts were starting to take over slowly. An excellent beer, but there are some other DIPAs above this one in my book at a comparable price level."
"I want to try this again but being more fresh, still a good brew as it is and would pick one up again."
"Batch#9 bottled in Feb.'09. Appearance is amber in color with a dense and stable white head. Aroma is dominated by grapefruit, pineapple, pine, and diggity dank. Flavor is first a blast of hops followed by a surprisingly nice malt character. Moving quickly back into hoppy layers and leaving a loooong a lingering piney finish. Alcohol is masked nicely being above 10%abv. Had a lot of DIPA's and this one is one of the best I've had!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, it pours a nice copper, orange color with a small white head. Leaves little but some lacing down the glass. Smell is hoppy and sweet, some citrusy hops. Pretty nice smell. Taste is great. Sweet, hoppy, grapefruit. A pretty good IPA overall. I've heard great things about this so I had to pick it up when I saw it. The bottle was a few months old so I imagine it's even better when fresh but I still think it's pretty good. Drinkability is pretty good, no problem finishing the bomber."
"MF&D - Thick and oily. Went down well and the high ABV was pretty well hidden. A solid beer. Paired well with a hunk of spicy pepperjack cheese."
"Poured light amber with a lasting white head. Immensely citrusy, a touch of fresh lemons, and mild bitterness. High alcohol warmth in the finish. Recommended."
"D: Yes."
"really great brew, would possibly get again, but only if ruination wasn't available."
"At around the $6 mark...this is a must have! Just wish it was brewed year around."
"This is a superb DIPA"
"This is a very good beer all around."
"D--This one is very interesting but damn it is definitely a sipper. Split the bomber and prepare to have your palate destroyed. Great brew, maybe not top tier but definitely borderline."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers ever."
"Drinkability: Hops heads will like. Others won't."
"Drinkability: Given the ABV and the slightly chewy feeling I'm not sure I could handle another bomber of this in a night. Still on my first tulip glass and can already feel the alcohol..."
"Opaque copper brown body underneath tan head, not much lacing to speak of. Big hop profile in the nose, but some Lorna Doone cookieish malt presence. A nice balance on the tastebuds, big piney oily hops with the cookie goodness. A definite sipper, and at this ABV, one is plenty. Not by favorite DIPA, but certainly worth a try."
" because I thought it redundant."
"Drinkability: Moderate for style - drinks easily despite ABV, but really quite sticky and thick."
"A very good beer."
"Verdict: As I had expected, with over 100 IBUs and 10% alcohol content, Maharaja is a massive beer. This is your typical big, untamed, unleashed Double IPA with a massive hop character, but a solid enough malt backbone to keep everything in check. This is only the second Avery beer I've tried, but I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed so far."
"Drinkability: This just might be my new favorite DIPA. From the lacing to the whiffs of hops to the sticky finish in my mouth, this beer rocks my socks off. That's why I'm barefoot now."
"D - I could drink this all night, if the side effects weren't so serious. The website lists this brew at 9.7% abv, but the bottle I have says 10.27% abv! This beer tastes great, and hides the alcohol incredibly well, but I'll only have one at a time."
"The feel is creamy but buttery, oily and smooth. Really great on the palate; lessens the bite of the hops. This is one heavy beast of a beer. Really strong and really good."
"- I could drink this stuff for a long time though... because it does have a very citrus extract sort of Lagunitas Hop Stoopid taste.... or is it almost the same thing... just a tad stronger?"
"Notes: This an absolutely stunning double ipa. it's viscous, harsh and must be respeceted. Maharaja is definately an perfect name for this hop bomb. Cheers"
"D-Is this drinkable? Hell yes, is it sessionable?, Hell no. Am I going to buy some more of this? Absolutely...a gem."
"D- Very drinkable for a big beer, dangerous."
"Served in a pint glass, this beer was an amber color with a thick, white, sticky head. Lots of lacing. The aroma was intensely floral, with a bit of malt. Big piney hops taste, again a bit of malt. Pretty well-balanced, although this was a really hoppy beer. One, maybe two, at a sitting."
"Solid IPA! Drink up. And consider sharing."
"Poured into a tulip[ for an auburn cider gold body with minimal head and lace down the glass. An intense soapy/floral hop smell with plenty of citric hop notes. Incredibly dry with tropical and citric fruit flavors tucked in a smooth, medium body. Hints of bread and oak malts mixed in there with hints of caramel malt. Finishes crisp and this is a great beer but a little too dry to be sessionable. I just wish it was a tad less husky on the tongue."
"In all fairness the beer is a good representation of the style, but I'm not particularly fond of it."
"I can't drink D.IPA's all night long without totally losing my taste buds. That said, I still find this beer to be pleasant and drinkable, especially when explosive hops are what I'm after."
"D- the high ABV kind of takes away on this one"
"Overall - The beer smells divine and the flavors are pronounced and complex. Absolutely fantastic brew that could easily be classified as a masterpiece."
"Finishes like an uber-strong malt liquor. Way too much alcohol and carbonation on the back end."
"This is a pretty good beer. Definitely great if you're into those piney hops, and sweet malt, then this beer is right up you alley. Saw it next to a Hop Henge at the store, and this beer reminds me of that one."
"I was very impressed by this DIPA. It has a very clean and fresh profile from start to finish."
"pours clear copper orange with a good 2.5 finger head that leaves lacing notches all down the glass. smells of strong citris, pine, and sweet malts. taste starts of with big grapefruit hops and sweet malts and finishes with bitter pine bite. this beer has a medium body creamy finish but leaves just enough hop resin to coat you mouth. drinkability is off the charts even @10.27abv. now i need to go back to the store and pick up a few more."
"D - Fantastic DIPA with a huge hop presence that I found to be quite pungent and fresh. As excellent on tap as it is from the bottle."
"d: Pretty good, but not my cup of tea."
"D - Very powerful DIPA - barley detect the alcohol. Very strong taste - couldn't throw back too many of these. I sipped on this one for about an hour."
"D: Some beers beg for another sip and this is one of those beers. Full flavored and well balanced; not overwhelming in any sense, this beer leaves just enough on the palate that you continuously need just another taste before you put down the glass."
"I am a fan of big hoppy beer. This was a recommendation from the beer geeks at Lukas Liquor. I went in looking for Breckenridge 471 Small Batch IPA and they suggested this was a good substitute. They we were right. You can smell the hops right away. Nice amber color with a nice head. Carmel flavors at first then a nice hop bite with little aftertaste. I can see this becoming a regular."
"A very good example of the style. The hops are spot on and this beer is a hop lover's delight. Easy to drink and worth a try. You must seek this out."
"Dangerously delicious and drinkable for the ABV."
"D=very drinkable, dangerous given the ABV, could have easily had a few more"
"Drinkability: This was a great DIPA.. So much hoppiness and malt overload, it was suprisingly sessionable and bold enough to keep my attention. This is no Hop Stoopid but it's a damn good backup if you want something hoppy with a big malt backbone."
"Drinkability: Truthfully I just do not want to stop drinking this beer. Wow I will buy more than just one more of these babies. Even with the over 10% alcohol it goes down super smooth."
"Tastebuds are assaulted by resinous pine sap and juicy grapefruit flavors. Sweet maltiness is there in abundance to at least stem the flow of lupulous hop juice. Tastes like a fresh nug of the sticky-icky! To say this beer is hoppy is certainly an understatement. I wonder what German maltsters would think of this...'Silly Americans, they soooo crazy'. Extreme beer, basically a hopheads wet dream. Definitely best tasting fresh, glad they put a bottle date on there. ABV is well hidden, but I have a feeling these hops might hide just about anything."
"Pours a dark golden color with a frothy white head into my tulip glass. Smell is knock-your-socks HOPS along with some citrus flavors. Taste is straight up hops/citrus and nothing else...a true hop bomb. Mouthfeel is nice and medium, just what I expect from this beer. At 10.6% ABV, I don't know how many I could drink but I do like it."
"D - This was a pretty good DIPA. It is decently balanced compared to some others and isn't as extremely over the top as some can be. Enjoyable, but the abv is going to make it hard to take down by myself."
"D: Goes down nicely, but you are certainly aware of the abv at all times. This alcohol isn't hidden extremely well - this one drinks and feels like a big beer."
"mouth is thick and creamy and it warms my mouth and stomach on its way down. i had to double check the abv on this a few times, because there is no way i would have guessed this was a 10.27 abv. but daddy likey. this is a fantastic beer and now i work on building up a clone recipe."
"D: At almost 10%, it's not a session ale, but it's damn tasty. An incredibly well-balanced and finely crafted imperial IPA."
"While I probably wouldn't spend the whole night drinking this, I could handle a few pints to start. Overall a very good Imperial IPA and worth checking out."
"Good brew, but not different enough from the barleywine. If it was a bit less sweet it'd be an easy favorite."
"Drink this beer slowly. Sip on it. It will fuck you up if you don't take it seriously, trust me, I know from experience."
"D- I personally think this beer is very drinkable. I love this beer and waited a whole year to have it again. However, if you are not into hops you should stay the hell away from this beer. I will deduct some points for that reason alone."
"D- Killer beer. Worth about 4 standard beers for a decent price."
"Amber tinged orange, bright with a fine clarity. Bursting with citrusy orange, grapefruit aromas, approaching tropical proportions. Smooth bodied, a little bit syrupy, with sturdy anchoring malts holding down the fort under the huge dank/fruity hop load. The foam is lasting to the end, and leaves generous lace. A really nice DIPA that i'm glad to have discovered. Locally comparable to Flossmoor and FFF in quality and taste."
"D - I'm giving this good drinkability...but with precaution...you have to love hops and you have to be careful of the 10% ABV...other you could enjoy this beer all day"
"Overall impression: Very enjoyable DIPA."
"a wasted effort on one of my favorite beers."
"I could sip on this for quite a while, I am quite impressed with this beer, an excellent offering from avery."
"Wow, quite impressed with this one. Thanks to hearing about it on BA I picked one up at my sisters local store while in town over Easter. Whats great about this beer is that I let my friend try it (not really into hops, but I'm changing him) I was expecting bitter beer face but he said """wow, this is really good.""" And I thought this is awesome I have finally got him to really appreciate hops! Some reviews called it extremely bitter. I dont think so, and thats why my friend liked it - because it isnt. Its way more aroma and flavor. Piney and resiny while grapefruit and dank buds shine against a strong malty backbone. Delicious. I would have expected it to be a little fuller in body and there is a little alcohol bite. Definitely a sipper because it is a strong one. Almost in between Arrogant Bastard and Ruination, But very different indeed. Wish I could get it on the regular."
"Not for the uninitiated to the realm of strong hoppy beers. And definitely something I can't see myself enjoying for more than two per sitting. Could also be a little more refined - like the present king of double IPAs Pliny the Younger - but the overall taste, appearance, and aromas puts Maharaja among my top five Imperial IPAs."
"Overall:4.15 (A-)"
"This is just a MASSIVE hop bomb of a DIPA from Avery. Huge body, bitterness, and tropical fruits are the highlights, even though they might not always mesh at times. If your looking for a hoppy punch in the face, definitely check this out."
"this is quickly becoming one of my favorite brews - pours a slightly hazy orange with a frothy 2 finger cream colored head - thickest lacing i've seen all the way down the glass - the sweetest hop aroma - followed by the sweetest hop flavor, with notes of pine and citrus, with the sweetest malt(?) backbone - good carbonation with a heavy, but not cloying, mouthfeel -one of these(22oz) puts on a good beer buzz, but i always want(but may not have) another - real good stuff!"
"D- The 22oz bottle that I sampled was probably all my taste buds could take of this one. Definitely a solid DIPA."
"Silky, heavy, round in the mouthfeel, very easy drinker given the abv, but hard to finish a small glass, just enough bomb taste for one. I would compare this to Goose's DIPA, very good drinker."
"D: Overall, its superb. It is on the sweet side, but the overload of hop action kind of makes the situation pleasant. Great closer to a session. Recommended."
"Smells and tastes a little sweet/fruity but is really creamy. Hops come through in the end mostly with malt up front. Overall an extremely tasty beer but a tiny bit malty. Very drinkable for a 10%!"
"D: An amazing brew. Would drink again in a second and it is way up there in my list of DIPA's. Now, if I am going to nit pick, I have to say that for my personal taste, the sweetness was a touch too sickly and the alcohol flavor is too exposed. Again, pay attention to my score to realize that these points are minor in the overall experience. At the end of the day, it was an incredibly bold DIPA that was thoroughly enjoyed!"
"D: The only thing that hinders the drinkablility is the abv, 10.27 is a bit high. That being said, I can't put this beer down and I've stopped trying..just have a longer morning."
"D - A little strong on the alcohol content to be an extremely drinkable beer, from a session standpoint, but i would love one of these every so often."
"Nonetheless, this is a really good beer. Very drinkable a great Imperial IPA."
"This is very drinkable. The balance is key to the drinkability."
"D: This is 10.27%? It may not drink like it, but it definitely hits you later. Anyway, this is definitely recommended if you're a hophead."
"D= Amazing beer right here. Smooth and delicious. Great grapefruity DIPA"
"D- At 10.2% this beer is very drinkable and highly enjoyable. Probably not my first choice for a DIPA but overall a great beer."
"Overall - Maybe a bit too much raw hop component and the ABV will sedate a small horse, but a good beer overall. Not for the faint-of-heart."
"Just had the newest, Feb. 09 version of this beer. Always thought it was too sweet and malty in the past, but really loved this beer this time. Poured a transparent dark orange color with the carbonation maintaining a steady crawl up the sides of the glass. Smelled very sweet and good. Tasted of fruity hops, a very good, fresh taste that I was pleased with. Mouthfeel and drinkability were great. I could definitely drink on this with no problem which says a lot for this beer considering its ABV. Very good overall and this is one I look forward to trying every year."
"I'd love to try this on tap to see of there's any difference and I'll likely get at least another one of this batch a few months from now but I also look forward to future batches."
"Had this beast on tap at a new bar in Boca Raton, FL. The look of this beer is your standard IPA with nice redish yellow tone and nice fluffy head. Smell is where this beer is at, this was so fresh that the hops were dancing in my nostrils. I could smell strong tangerine, summer morning a bit of lemon zest. The taste hits like a brick very hoppy and malty, the hops lingers on your tongue and a sweet candy like finish. The alcohol heat up as it warms. This was truly impressive fresh and on tap made it even better."
"Overall: I love this one! I've never had it before and am very impressed. If you love hops, give this a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
"warning...it will knock you on your ass."
"This ia a powerful IPA and really hopped up to the point of extreme. But it has a good handle on the style."
"The pour was very nice with a rich light golden amber. Smooth and very cloudy, this thing looked like it was about to kick my ass, and as I was about to find out, it was defintley going to. Lots of ripe grapefruit and pineapple hops that just tore through the air as soon as I leaned in to it. Huge notes of hops dominated the entire flavor as well. Sharp flavor here as the resin like hops took all the moisture out of my mouth and left me parched, dry and looking for more. One of the best finishes I have had in a big IPA in a very, very long time. I would love to try this one again and will defitely be on the lookout to try it again."
"It's been a while since I revisited this beer, and I think I'd forgotten how fantastic it is fresh. I'm glad to say that it's just as good as I remembered."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall, this was easily one of the most """hopped""" beers that I've tasted. It is head and shoulders above many other DIPA offerings. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is good, but nothing exceptional. Drinkability? The high ABV stops me during or after 1 bomber, but this is incredibly delicious if you like an old-fashioned hop bomb."
"Overall: By far my new favorite DIPA. Blows all others out of the water and every idea of what DIPAs should taste like. Lets just say I had a Stoudts DIPA after this and it tasted like a pale ale. Oh and by the way its 10.27% ABV."
"Review from 6-21-08: Pours a clear copper color with a tan colored head that recedes very slowly, leaving some lovely lacing along the sides of the glass. Aroma is extremely floral with hints of tropical fruits and some nice piney hop characteristics. Taste is extremely piney. Nice use of caramel malts to back it up giving a slight malt sweetness, but the pine notes are completely dominant. Hints of grapefruit round it out, extra-bitter for the hop-heads, slightly grassy and somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with delicate carbonation. Drinkability is low due to the high alcohol content. A nice representation of the style, but missing my favorite American hop varieties."
"Screams out for sip after sip, even at over 10% abv. (Listed at 10.54% on their menu.) I followed this with a Pranqster, which at 7%, tasted boozier than Maharaja. Delicious. I'm not sure how this compares to fresh WC IIPAs, but if those are so much better than this, I need to make a trip ASAP. Starts to taste very sweet when it warms, which slowed me down a bit. Maybe it is all that booze kicking in, but one glass felt like enough. Could have been palate fatigue as well. The lack of malt complexity shows as a bit of a weakness over time, and is one reason why I can drink 90 Minute all night long, but would probably top out at a bomber of this."
"On tap at Abraxas. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice, it rests a peachy gold with a thin cap of foam. Nose is overwhelmingly pink grapefruit juice, like cutting open a ripe Indian River grapefruit, very nice. Citrusy hop dominates the flavor as expected, yet backed up by clover-honey sweetness. Feel is thick and hefty; in this area, I feel it could pass for a barleywine, not surprising at 10.54%. One to savor, this isn't a quick-drinking DIPA, as it skews to the stronger side of an already strong style."
"D: Pretty good, but not as good as I thought it would be. Nice malt flavor though, just wanted the hops to pop through more. High ABV in a 22oz bottle makes one of these plenty."
"Future outlook: This was excellent. I'm sure I'll want to give it another whirl sometime."
"For my tasting notes, this may be the benchmark for DIPA."
"Drinkability is not so easy. The high alchahol makes this a good sipper but not easy to drink to quickly."
"The beer lent a nice one finger head that laced well on the pour. The floral aroma of the brew, a product of the lovely hoppiness, came out powerfully--the smell was my favorite part of this beer, it was delightfully refreshing, perhaps more intoxicating than the beer itself, I'd jest, but with its nearly 10% ABV, this brew packs a punch. The taste is good, but not terribly outstanding with regard to other nice IPA's. The bitterness of the hops predominates alongside a mild malty sweetness. The carbonation foams up in the mouth yielding a nice velvety mouthfeel; the beer goes smoothly down the throat. Overall, it's a tasty drink, but not one that I'd buy again over more preferable (and less expensive imperial IPA's). It's good's the point, but there are better beers of this sort."
"Pours a copper orange clear color with a big white head. Smell is of grapefruit and sweet pineapple gummy bears. Flavor is similar to aroma, and has a great balance between the sweet caramel malts, and huge bitterness and flavor of citrusy fresh squeezed orange. Medium full in body with moderate carbonation feel. A good example of a IIPA. Not as complex as the best examples, but still incredible."
"An excellent double IPA. Served in a pint glass. Slight haziness, lots of bubbles, ring of white head. Nose is hops, more west coast hops, grass and grapefruit mixed with other citrus. Taste is a super hop bomb with intricate citrus flavors and delicate pine and flower. Mouthfeel is syrupy and resinous. This is a hop lover's beer, but it doesn't bash you over the head - the interwoven layers help to soften the blow, and create a rich texture of flavors. Probably my favorite from Avery."
"Nicely complex beer for hop lovers, and dangerously drinkable."
"Consumed at 45 degrees. Pours with an excellent head for such an uberly hopped beverage. An overflowing amount of pine and malt come through in the drink. It has a nice hanging bitterness with a subtle sweetness. A very enjoyable beer, and one worth trying for the IIPA fan."
"I just don't get this style, and have tried to appreciate it. I can't say that I have had to many bad Double IPA's, but they just don't do it for me. This is no exceptions. I love hops, I just love a balanced beer more I guess. Though this follows the style, and should be a big hit for the hop head."
"mouth is oily but crisp and might be a little too over-carbonated but who really cares. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had."
"very drinkable, but over time. not a session beer by ANY means. but this is a GREAT DIPA that i will be drinking over the next few months. i also had this from the bottle, and i preferred the bottle hands down."
"Alcohol is evident but not overwhelming. As it warms, a honeyish note shows up. Beautifully integrated, massive brew. Some light lace remains on the glass."
"This beer pours a clear light amber with a honey colored one finger head. The head had very nice retention and lacing clung to the glass in thick coats. Nose was a combination of fresh baked bread and spicy floral citrus. Taste starts very sweet and move in to a spicy peppery, floral, piney combination. Finish is a bit buttery. Given the ABV on this, I expected more of an alcohol presence in the taste - I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't! This beer is a medium body and there is a very nice buttery feel to the mouth. If it weren't for the high ABV, this would be a fantastic session beer."
"yummy yummy i love these world ruler beers that avery makes the maharaja tastes like an ipa should. its high abv is perfectly countered by the hops. the label on the bottle is beautiful like most of averys select beers. perfect seasonal to try just a few times while its around. beware of overpricing on this and other avery beers"
"D- one is enough, and more than what i craved for my hop fix. wow, this was an intense IIPA. check this one out, especially if you can get it fresh."
"Pours out an almost amber color with a big off-white head. The bubbles look dense and clingy and started to lace the glass early, though the head kind of falls back relatively quickly, leaving only a few swirls of bubbles after the first few sips. Looks pretty good. Smells very good too. I can immediately smell the fruity hops, grapefruit yes, but also tropical fruit, mango etc. There's a hint of sweetness and peachy alcohol, but really the hops dominate with whiffs of pine, resin, and grass as well. As usual, Avery has thrown in the huge ABV, with this bottle saying 10.27%, and I can really taste it, which hurts on the hop front for me. But there is enough hop flavor in there to see past it. I get the alcohol burn and hop bitterness first, followed by an intense grassy taste with just a kick of tropical fruit behind it. Finishes with a little battle between tart dryness and malty sweetness. The huge alcohol note hurts the mouthfeel, giving me primarily burn, but I kind of like the resinousy feel from the hops. Almost chewy from the hoppy flavors, though the malty liquid itself is kind of thin with alcohol. And this one really wears on you. Its a very enjoyable beer, but I was already slowing down after 4 sips or so. The alcohol just warms you and starts to make your head spin a bit quick. I would recommend it, but you might want to split it between friends to enjoy it the most - too much booze."
"Drinkability- It's hard not to give this a high score on drinkability, as it's such a magnificent brew, and as far as style goes, I think it's nearly perfect. Objectively though, I know that after two or three of these bottles, I'd be ready to hit the sack."
"Damn tasty brew. This was one of my first DIPAs (along with DFH 90min) and so I may be sentimental. Excellent presentation of hop character."
"Notes - The hops are very multidimensional here, but the syrupy sweetness is a little much at times."
"Overall- Huge IPA here. Very drinkable yet soo hoppy. A pint or a bomber of this would be sufficient."
"Slow sipper, and that's a good thing because if it wasn't it would put you on your ass. Full bodied and very smooth for a DIPA, some slight carbonation in the mix. This brew wasn't as bitter as I was expecting, especially at 102 IBU's. The aromas that I smelled came through nicely in the taste as well, strong floral hops, and citrusy grapefruit flavors. The 10% ABV is hidden very well by these strong flavors. I thought that it would finish a bit crisp and dry, but it stayed smooth even in the aftertaste. A solid offering from Avery."
"D: Totally drinkable, the high alcohol would be the only thing from stopping you when trying to take lots of this down."
"D: To me, this tastes like Avery's regular IPA turned up to 11. It's a nice beer, but not mind blowing. Perhaps I need a break from DIPA style beers for awhile."
"Pours a beautiful light amber-ish copper color with about a finger and a half of off white head. As soon as I open the bottle I can smell the hops. The aroma is very nearly all hops with only mere hints of some caramel malt. Lots of citrus, some pine, and a fair amount of grass. Taste is pretty darn good. Much like the aroma with hops dominating; citrus, grass and pine, in that order. There is a malt backbone here but its hard to find through the massive amount of hop flavor. This beer is quite bitter in the finish but it doesn't taste like the 102 IBUs that the bottle claims. I also can't find the 10.27 ABV that bottle claims either. I can feel it after a few minutes but it really isn't present in either the aroma of taste. Mouthfeel is quite good. Medium, maybe medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth despite the high bitterness. Drinkability is very good. This is a pretty good example of what I look for in a DIPA. Its loaded with hops, solidly bitter, properly carbonated, and most importantly, highly attenuated. I have no trouble finishing a bomber of this and enthusiastically recommend this."
"D: The alcohol after the swallow was pretty intense and I got more of a buzz than I was expecting. You certainly wouldn't want more than one. The high level of astringency in this one make me prefer the single IPA from Avery."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but certainly one I won't go out of my way for again. Perhaps the best thing would've been to share this one with friends because the whole bottle is bit overwhelming. If you are a fan of the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, you will like this one. They are very similar but the drinkability in this one is not as good."
"Scary drinkable. I wouldn't touch more than 22oz of it in a session. But, I will enjoy the whole 22oz. I would love to keep a bottle of this in the cellar to personally enjoy... and when fellow BA's visit so I can say.... """I have a bottle of the MAH-ha-RA-ja.""" What a perfect name for a superior DIPA/IIPA. Congratulations again to Avery."
"Definitely a full and flavorful brew, but it truly is fantastic with the hop aromas and flavors. I could sit and smell it all day long. I will say as it warms up, it becomes slightly more heavy, but still not to point where it is not enjoyable and enticing."
"The flavor was a well blended malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Huge flavor impact lowers the drinkability factor, but not the enjoyment factor for this ale. Avery has a number of very good offerings and represents one of my favorite lagers in their Kaiser offering. This Maharaja in an atypical IPA with huge flavor impact that is an exceptional value at $7 for this 22 oz. bottle. Wouldn't call it a must drink IPA but it is unusual enough to merit some attention."
"My favorite DIPA to date. Do not pass up the Maharaja."
"Drinkability: This is not an IPA. This is a barleywine in a DIPA's packaging. I'd love to see what age does to this one. It's definitely a sipper. I probably won't get this one again - unless I want a barleywine. I did enjoy it, but it's not a good representation of the style at all. If I were comparing it to other barleywines I'd have graded it higher."
"This is a big flavorful DIPA that has both the hops and the malts really ramped up. It's not the best melding of those two I've seen but it's pretty tasty."
"D= A fine example of a DIPA that hides its alcohol well. I could easily drink a few pints of this in a sitting!"
"This is another winner from Avery, but not for the faint of heart, or something to that extent? Very enjoyable and definitely hoptastic!"
"full and smooth mouthfeel ensure this is a sipping beer. fills you up a bit but a little goes a loong way."
"One pint, six Fl. Oz. bottle served in my Delirium Noel tulip; no freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a thin skim of off-white foam and ringlets that gathered around the perimeter of the bowl. A sheet of speck-like lacing was exposed after each tilt of the glass. Nose was sweet and hoppy with an indication of grapefruit and floral aromas. Taste follows nose, but a little less sweeter than anticipated and a mild bitterness at the finish that lingered between sips. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a slight viscosity on a lightly effervescent backbone. Excellent DIPA. Alcohol was fairly well-hidden, but I typically prefer the sweeter side of the style spectrum. Very enjoyable nonetheless."
"This was a great IPA. It had a huge hop aroma. It was a little cloudy on the appearance. The flavor was a strong hop kick. Not too bitter, but great flavor. It was one of the best double IPA i have ever had. It was a little heavy, so I only had 1 pint. But I would totally have it again."
"This beer is a great amber color with lots of creamy head. Make sure not to pour it too fast!! Smells of hops with great notes of grapefruit and other citrus fruit. The bitterness is balanced almost perfectly with the malty side of the beer. Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering as you might expect from the ABV. I could drink these all day long but it may be too much for someone who doesn't love the HOP! I have had this beer before while visiting the brewery and it was on cask. All I can say is HOLY CRAP!!! Awesome!! Go there and try it."
"4/12/2010 - Batch 11 (10.41% abv). Not quite as great as I remember but still quite good. Seems fairly boozy this time without quite as much hop delicacy. Some bland bitterness."
"Overall: very good, would really like a fresh one"
"The beer pours a deep golden color with a thick off white head. Foam slowly fades, lacing looks good. It has lots of hoppy smell, as expected. The taste is great, big hop kick but with enough solid maltiness to balance, complex not overdone. High alcohol is there but doesn't burn or overpower the rest of the flavor. The mouthfeel is full bodied, good level of carbonation. Balanced aftertaste, big and full of character. Very enjoyable."
"Quite thick and creamy, but not overly thick. A bit of carbonation. Pretty good overall really depends on how you like your DIPA and how strongly you like to taste your alcohol. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to trying more from Avery."
"Taste is bitter with a citric US hoppiness. The citric hops are somehow blended with less citric hops and make the beer not as mouth puckering as some other DIPA's. It tastes almost like a strong German hop. The beer has a syrupy mouthfeel that goes well with the biscuity malt. Balance is nice and aftertaste is lingering bitter and has a strong syrup maltiness."
"I think at such a great price, with so much flavor, and despite the 10.21 abv this beer is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer, but @ 10.21% it is hard to drink more than 3 or 4 pints. But honestly, that is more than enough to do the trick. I always seem to catch myself buying the Maharaja, I just can't seem to pass up this royal beverage, it literally is an imperial ale."
"Bottle, first batch of 2008. Poured cloudy orangish yellow with a nice thick head. Nose reeked of colombus hops, fruity and piney. Tastes mainly hoppy with sweet, fruity and piney notes, slightly boozy (second batch of 2008 tasted slightly sweeter). A personal favorite Imperial of mine, love it, can't wait til February."
"My first real go at a DIPA was a rousing success. Powerful flavors, smooth body, it's everything I was hoping for. It's beers like this that make me proud of the strides American brewers have made in recent years. Definitely give this a try if you can find it!"
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Drinkability: I'm damn sure that 22 months of age has lowered the hop content a little bit, but not even time could tame this beer's huge hop content. It was still overly hoppy! If a vintage bottle is this hoppy, I would love to try a fresh bottle Maharaja. It was nothing short of being a great hoppy beer. I'm positive that I could easily enjoy this beer again."
"Enjoyed a bomber at a local establishment while much of the area was digging out of recent snowfall. A big beer like this was just what the doctor ordered. Poured from a bomber into a traditional pint glass (bummer). Beer cascades well with a orange color into a thick, rich ivory head. The head leaves great lacing. The smell is wonderful with several citrus and floral tones upfront, the hops are certainly there but not overpowering, your nose can easily search and find the malts and some undetermined spices. Drinking this beer upfront you aren't overly assaulted with the hops but rather the floral and citrus tones. It gets abit chewy in the middle with some malts and finishes strong with the long lasting hop bitterness. It is very close to being a genuine full-bodied beer with medium carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is wonderful because the hops aren't overly assaulting but last a long while on your palate. The high ABV might slow down a longer drinking session but it is well worth a try. I will certainly be drinking it again."
"Overall, I was very pleased with this beer from Avery."
"Instant withering hops greet me as I take a slow skip. Citrus and especially pine are the active players. The malt then steps in with dark fruit flavors and caramel and chocolate tones. The finish returns to the hops and the aftertaste shows elements of both. Mouthfeel is thick and oily in the finish. I like this beer but I'm not overawed with it the way I was on tap."
"(rated Jan 17, 2008)"
"D-The nice balance of this brew lends good drinkability, regardless of the fact that the bitterness and hoppiness dominate the flavor profile. I know, I know, this beer isn't balanced, it's f*ing hoppy! But I still felt that the other flavors were represented well and vital to the overall profile for the beer."
"D - This DIPA is very easy to drink if the abv was lower I would drink it all night but at almost 10% gotta take it easy very good beer worth trying"
"Simply one of the best Imperial IPA's out there. Pours clear orange with a wuge white head. Aroma is grapefruit, hops, and pine. A sweeter Imperial versus, say Ruination or Pliny, but very good. Grapefruit, orange, and mango hops are all over the place, but with a sweet citrus-candy back. Caramel malt must be there to tame the hops, but can't really taste it. Great balance, incredible beer."
"deep dark amber pour with a small off white head. Glorious hop aroma with both citrus and floral hops present. nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel with citrus and pine hops in the forefront, balanced with a nice sweet caramel malt backbone. very nice."
"Notes: This is one kick-ass Imperial IPA! The Maharaja (interpreted to mean """Great King""") lives up to every expectation that its moniker implies. This is definitely the best Imperial IPA I've had to date. From the outset, the flavor just explodes on the tongue, releasing a shockwave of subtle malted barley, in-your-face citric hops, and a pungent kick that works just perfectly. Definitely a must-try for any IPA lover! What a great way to round out Turkey Day! Wish I had another..."
"The aroma has lots of pine and grapefruit hops with sweet malt and mint. The appearance is amber with a light haze and a large foamy head. The flavor is not complex but it fits the style very well by matching the aroma exactly with a small addition of spices. The bitterness is present from start to finish. The palate is thick and sticky with an earthy aftertaste. Overall it's really darn good!"
"D: Good for a10+% ABV DIPA. Nice blaance of citrus bang, sweet malts and bitter finish."
"D- This is a nice DIPA, and very thick. Definitely a sipper. If you're into big IPA's, give this one a shot. The alcohol on this one slightly hurts the drinkability, it's still pretty good."
"Notes from 5/9/05"
"I cannot argue with my previous self, which is surprising because of the ~5.5 year difference in visitations."
"D: A one bomber beer. Don't push it (I tell myself!)."
"Drinkability: Had this on tap before (at Brickstore in Decatur), and I think it was a little better on tap. Still, a solid, good, west-coast IIPA."
"In fact this is the beer that Chuck Norris drinks"
"This bomber pours out a reddish medium copper hue, with lots of foamy white head, and lacing all around the glass. The smell contains a whole lot of citrus hops and strong caramel malt essence, and is quite wonderful. The taste starts with a big citrus hop blast at the front, which mellows quickly and smoothly into the sweet raisiny malt body. There is low carbonation, and a warming from the alcohol. This is quite an intensely flavoured beer, true to the style, and quite good, and sharing the bomber is just about right."
"Pours an amber red color body that is very clear. Can get almost no head out of the pour, it is off-white, and diminishing. A strong aroma of hops, bitterness. Hoppy taste but not overly bitter, semi-sweet, and has a bitter aftertaste."
"Very drinkable! A little too drinkable. I could have 5 of these. Definently a royal brew. Thank you Avery. The Lord bless the hop harvest."
"22 oz. bottle, Batch 8, May 2008. Pours an orange-amber color with a decent off-white head, pretty good lacing. Aroma is pine, citrus hops with a decent malty backbone, caramel and pale malts. Taste is initial citrus hops with a good amount of maltiness, finishes fairly bitter. Mouthfeel is astringent (esp. the finish), fairly thick, and fairly active carbonation. Good beer, a more malty DIPA than I've had recently."
"One of my top 10 beers I have enjoyed to date and the least expensive. I can only imagine what a few years in the cellar will bring."
"I will definitely be drinking this one again."
"NC BEERMONGER LOVES THIS IPA!"
"D - Very easy drinking. Smooth and not too overpowering. I like this beer a lot, but a little less malt and more bitterness would be more to my liking."
"There is a very malty presence to support the amount of hops which gives it a full mouthfeel. This isn't a very refreshing beer, but a very good tasting one."
"Overall, this is what a DIPA should be! Tons of hop flavors, but it doesn't make you pucker with bitterness."
"Overall, very good, I find hoppier double pale ales to be very refreshing, especially this time of year in the midst of all of the stout releases. Again this one is loaded with hops, and is definitely worth a try."
"A little too sweet to earn an excellent drinkability rating but with 10% ABV that is probably a good thing. Great beer that I would highly recommend for any hophead!"
"D: Very drinkable double IPA as I did not notice the alcohol in it."
"Drinkability only hurt by the abv%. I've put back 2 bombers twice now over the course of maybe 3-4 hours, watching baseball. The alcohol sort of sneaks up on you as you really don't notice it like you do in say a DFH90min, or even a Hercules. Really, really good job by Avery here."
"Poured a beautiful dark gold, slight head, and gave the smell of a wet-hopped, bitter, IPA. Came with a kick as well, advertised 10.2%. A beer worth the purchase if you see it."
"Mouthfeel is clean and tight, leaving an oily film through the mouth."
"4/4/4/4/3.5"
"Appears hazy copper with a large head and extensive lacing. The smell is explosively grapefruit and pine. Maybe a little bit of peach. The taste is exceptional with bold hop character, grapefruit and a caramel malt moderator that steps aside for the main event. A full body tries to tame the abv and IBUs, but comes up a bit short. Maharaja means business. It's a top DIPA, but a little too massive to completely throw caution to the wind. A very complex DIPA that I will continue to scrutinize and enjoy."
"Not much bubbling in this copper toned brew. Some nice sticky, lace up to thirty minutes after the pour. Slowly recedes to a ring o' foam. Th smell is a blend of bitter orange zest and the aroma you get when you break a danelion stem in half and take a whiff. Very flowery beer with no shortage of toasted biscuit malts in both the aroma and taste. The taste starts with lots of citrus skin. Borderline burnt/toasted white notes begin to mix with a flower field of herbal and flowery hops.Very nice tasting DIPA. Palte is a chewy, resiny, hop bomb. I'mso glad this beer is always available by me."
"Drinkability was very low due to the massive alcohol content and the letdown that this brew was for me. I won't be purchasing this beer again. DIPA without hops whatsoever makes no sense to me."
"D: 9.7% and you do not even feel it, its very tasty and drinkable"
"D: The taste well exceeded my expectations. Coupled with some Black Sabbath and some bacon cheeseburgers I was pleased with the overall experience. It is too early to say if this is one of my favorite imperials but I suspect it will be in the running as time passes."
"D-For a big one this is quite drinkable. It is certainly a pallete killer though, so another is in order after the 1st because everything else will be off after this."
"D: Like I mentioned above the malt and hops meld very well and I could easily drink this beer often. The higher alcohol level was not that evident, but then again I only drank one over time. A nice effort and one in which I will search out again!"
"D: A huge showing of hops and malt combine beautifully for a huge citrusy blast that is sure to please. is equally as big alcohol wise and a monster of treat that comes with a high recommend for the serious hophead."
"D- deserves a 4.5, but due to self limitations, i can't give it that extra bit but while wrapped up in the tasting i finished this bomber quicker than i would have liked. very smooth if you're a hop head and very well hidden alcohol."
"Poured a clear amber with 1 finger of creamy off-white head, good retention and great sticky lacing. Smells of grapefruit, caramel, fresh biscuits, grapes, and pine needles. Tastes of grapefruit, and lemon rind up front with some oranges, then caramel, freshly baked biscuits still a little doughy, and some fruits like grapes and berries. Finish is pure pine. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Sticky, crisp, and bitter, balanced with great stand out citrus presence as well as a nice pine kick. One pretty impressive Double IPA that hides its alcohol excellently."
"D: I will definitely have another. This is a beautiful DIPA."
"D: Not too high due to the alcohol content and hops, but very enjoyable. I think a bomber is the perfect size for this brew, and it is perfect as a nightcap."
"Bottle / Artwork - Love it... Great Red/Yellow font on time of a lively green label... Holographic sables and an interesting spiritual warrior in the center... The foil overtop the cap was a bit much..."
"22oz bomber obtained at The Liquor Shoppe in Tyngsborro, MA. Bottled May 2008 (batch 8). Pours a fairly clear amber-red body with virtually no head. Citrussy and floral hops dominate with a fair bit of caramel malt for balance. Citrus floral hops dominate the flavor initially with a rich caramel toffee malt presence to balance things out. Silky-smooth in texture with light carbonation. Despite the full body and flavor (not to mention the alcohol, which is barely noticeable), this beer is surprisingly drinkable, leaving me wanting more. A phenomenal example of the style, a great beer. My first Avery, looking forward to many more soon!"
"Poured from 22 oz. bomber into a sam perfect pint glass. Pours a cloudy orange/ brownish color with a pretty good off white head. Smells of sweet caramel malts with some citrus hops in there. It seems when trying these DIPA's I hope for the best - ie. a really pungent hop smell or get what I dont want- the malty candy smell. This one- I get the latter. Taste is pretty good, but it is what I would expect from the smell. Lots of malt- candy, caramel. There is a decent hop flavor- some pine and some citrus, but not a hop BITE. Good beer, but would not seek it out with so many other wonderful IPA's and DIPA's out there."
"the beer itself looks like apple juice in my glass with a huge ideal frothy ivory colored head. the nose is very floral, floral hops and mellowed spicy hops. the taste is smoothe as hell! floral hops and mellowed spicy hops again. full bodied, low carbo, sweet finish. Definately gotta be number one on my list of IPAs!"
"D, notes: Smooth easy drinking, well balanced very drinkable. This is a great example of the style. Between Great Divide Hercules and this beer Colorado has a lock on double IPAs for my money."
"Full sticky mouthfeel that encourages slower sipping. Moderate carbonation serves to prick the palate and provoke the hops to increased bitterness. It is very difficult to call this large brew drinkable, but it is a beer I would enjoy turning to often."
"Drinkability - Avery is new to our State, but not new to me. I usually shy away from the overly hoppy brews (personal choice) but this one was very enjoyable, only due to the malt balance that pulled this beer into my comfort zone. Sure, I'll buy it again."
"D: This beer is delicious . It is a bit one sided on the hops, but not too much so that I couldn't see drinking it all night."
"The beer is poured to a dark copper with a good inch head and good retention. The nose is citursy and piny with a good caramel malt tone in the background. Smells very good. The taste on this beer is fucking great, it has a nice peach/citrus/grapefruit hop character with a tasty, sweet malt, which I can't place my finger on. Some alcohol comes through in the beer with the bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is drinkable for me."
"Bomber. Orange color, some sticky lacing and a nice aroma with a lot of pine needles and citrus hops and the longer it breathes the stronger it seems to get. Big hoppy flavor with a lot of pine needles, citrus grapefruit and oranges. Just enough sweet malt backing while still allowing the hops to dominate. Very nice bitterness in the finish. Excellent!"
"D: Uber-hoppy with a high ABV. One and you're way done."
"Sampled after my EX-lady and I brought it across the country during a road trip. Stamped 'Imperial IPA, bottled in February '08.' Poured into my glass a slightly hazy orange like a sunset with a one finger, yellow and tan head like the coat of a yellow lab. Chunks of lacing stick to the glass. Aromas were of big fresh, wet hops with some hints of green apple. The 102 IBU'S shows in the muscular, 'green' hops character that first hit my tongue. Hay, citrus peel, bitter hops. A sweeter maltiness comes in next to balance and does so surprisingly well. One can barely tell that this mammoth beer clocks in at 10.54% ALC! Low/mid carbonation is perfect, adding to the quaffable, smooth and lush mouthfeel. Though I said it looked like a Lab, this brew is anything but a dog. Truly, I think it's exactly what an Imperial IPA should be and if it had it displayed slightly more depth of flavor and better retention of the head it would be amongst the best in the world. Well, ok, one can argue it still is. I wouldn't object..."
"D - Too strong for more than one."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Neither are great due to pronounced bitterness; although some malt fruit sneaks through into the finish."
"I was surprised by how good this beer was. Great mouthfeel, and not too much bitter aftertaste make this a really really good beer."
"this is a tremendously balanced double IPA whos individual elements contrast and pop well which makes it so drinkable. Maybe it's the bit of age on this baby I am wondering how it would taste both fresh and with about another year on it. An absolutely fantastic DIPA."
"Drinkability: Not bad but not the best."
"D - Definately a big DIPA, and I found it very enjoyable. Would certainly reach for it again, and would love to try it right off the tap."
"D - A great beer with really no off characteristics. I wish there was a tad more malt sweetness, but not a huge issue."
"Aces."
"While the only other beer I've had from Avery is the Kaiser, this brewery - like some other Colorado based breweries I've had - proves to be quite good at their offerings."
"This poured a translucent amber with light tan head. It smelled like strong floral hops, with copper hops and honey malt blended in, and a hint of alcohol. It tasted like a potent blend of grapefruit and floral hops, with light honey malt for a bit of balance. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a solid grapefruit aftertaste, with slight alcohol warming. Overall this was a very clean and delicious beer that was very drinkable despite its potency. I have nothing to complain about, only to enjoy. (A huge relief following The Beast. Maharaja restored my faith in Avery.)"
"An incredible DIPA. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I'd want to drink this one all the time."
"Overall I was pretty damn pleased with this one. The only downside really is the overabundant alcohol taste. Take that down a level and this might be one of the best tasting DIPAs. Reminds me a lot of Hopslam."
"Beer poured a deep copper/amber colour, medium body, ended with a light head and lacing that lasted throughout the entire consumption. Nose distinctively HOPPY, and ended with a bitter aftertaste, as true IPA's do. I am not a hophead and it was nice to taste this treat, but wouldn't want more."
"Small head, but thick lacing, nice orange/amber color. HOP BOMB in the nose, too overpowering/stale. Same in the taste, grassy, raw hops just too powerful. Sweetness cloys and acts funny in trying to balance the hops. Not my favorite but is OK when it warms."
"EDIT: Actually I couldn't finish the second glass, not a good balanced beer at all."
"I love supporting Colorado beers and this one certainly is worth the time and money. Perhaps, what stands out most to me in this beer is the appearance--a beautiful red. It pours a modest head, and quickly fills the nostrils with a declaration of hops. The bottle describes the hops as """tangy, vibrant, and pungent.""" This, I wholeheartedly concur with. Avery's Maharaja arrived at my pallet highly recommended. Smooth mouthfeel, one should definitely expect a bitter aftertaste (as the style commands), and be satisfied."
"Shit, am I sweating because of this brew, or is it just hot in here? Mellowing out this brew over time could cool off the heat."
"Pop the cap and get ready to get hit in the face with a huge grapefruit. The scent jumps right out of the bottle and fills the room while pouring into a glass. Cloudy, malty orange in color with a fluffy quarter inch head that hangs tight for a bit. Even after it fades a slight foam cap sticks around leaving lace on the glass through it's entire duration. Letting it breathe a bit some honey and malt come out in the aroma but the hoppy grapefruit bang still dominates. The taste is all about sweet hop city. A mixture of pink grapefruit, tangerine and of course the expected pine are the up front flavors. A hint of apples and brown sugar come out too as the brew warms a little. Quite bold with mellow bitter but not eye watering as was expected from the smell. The beer itself has a creamy fluffiness in the mouth which is something Avery has mastered and they don't mess with that formula here at all. It finishes with a lingering hop tang in the mouth and an slight alcohol warming down the throat but at 9.6 abv and 102 ibu's surprisingly not all bossy and overbearing as it might have been if put in the hands of other brewers."
"D: Great. I'll have again and again. But just one bomber at a time."
"Great flavor and not overwhelmingly bitter. The warmth and high ABV keeps this beer from being extremely drinkable. One and done for me, but I would definitely grab it again sometime."
"The flavor here rolls around the fruity hops spectrum with, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and citrus zest with a little floral perfume and spice around the edges. The malt sweetness, I think, is a tad much - overbalanced sweetness for a double IPA. In a sense, this beer is a bit like a hoppy fruit punch. A must-try DIPA, not like the rest."
"D = A reasonable and easy quaff that """Shakelton""" would approve of. Several bottles was just the ticket for me."
"buy it, chill it, drink it. GODDAMN"
"www.theviceblog.com"
"This beer is as good as the style gets. Show me a better example of an IIPA. I dare you."
"Sticky - far from clean, but that's hardly a bad thing. Full body, excellent carbonation. This beer looks great in the glass, smells good, and my mouth luxuriates in the experience as it rolls across my palate - there's nothing really wrong here, and I'll gladly have it again. That I can't rate it higher is simply a testament to the number of absurdly good double IPAs in this country. Hooray Beer!"
"Drinkability: It's packed full of flavor and experiences, without being overpowering. Most things that begin with """imperial""" I would be hesitant to consume more than two before I start squandering the tasting experience in exchange for haziness. However, this is just smooth enough that I could see myself enjoying a few of these in a night while still enjoying all its subtleties in full."
"Paired this with (don't laugh I was hungry and getting a bit drunk) Cracked Peppercorn Triscuits - American cheese - and roasted turkey breast. It tasted great to me!"
"I know I am commiting an IPA crime but putting 2 bottles of this down in my cellar but I tried a 1 year old bottle awhile back and really enjoyed it."
"Overall its an IIPA with lots of spicy/floral hop but a little too much sweetness to contend with. Dry this out and we'd be drinking a much better beer. I could finish a pint but no more."
"Pour as a toasty tennessee orange, with some red suggestions. Head is dense off-white, but not that aggressive...maybe a weak pour. Nose is soft but contains lots of grapefruit or citrus as would be accepted, also some malt suggestions, more than usual for the style. Taste is good but actually too balanced for my tastes, I like a little more in the way of oily hops than this offers. The taste is pleasant but his a malty sweet finish rather than the bitter pucker i prefer. The bottle I sampled was a 2008 batch 8, if that means anything to anyone, it's printed on the bottle."
"D: A very good DIPA, one of the better ones I've had. The alcohol comes through a bit but it doesn't dominate."
"Not a very sublt beer and a little overpowering in the alcohol department which is usually what I think of the big Avery beers."
"D- One of these per setting is all I would be able to muster, that being said this was a delightful experience and will be anticipating the next shipment."
"One of the strongest finishes for an IPA that I've had, I'd even put it up against Ruination despite the significant difference in IBUs. Great DIPA all around."
"Very good beer. Tastes just like it smells, with a nice little kick at the end & a nice dry bite. Easy drinking. A perfect summer beer to go with the pasta & mushrooms simmering on the stove."
"Someday I would like to try a much fresher version. I only noticed the date after I got it home and am very surprised that the store which is held in high esteem in the region would sell it when it is past its prime."
"In addition to great beer, Avery does such great work with the """other stuff"""! They have the classy foil tops on the bottles, a name for the beer that eludes to the style, and a beautifully artistic picture and description. The Maharaja is no exception! As one of the kings of the uber-competitive Imperial IPA category, this beer rules with an iron fist. Certainly not for the faint of palate, this beer pours a burnt orange color with a big head and great lacing retention. The aroma reveals a massive amount of hops, adding touches of citrus, pine, and even a candy-like sweetness not typical to the category. I'm having trouble placing it, but lemonheads come to mind. The flavor on the nose packs a good wallop of malts and hops and seems fairly balanced (a warm fair king, good to his subjects!) However, the beer finishes with a stinging mix of alcohol and hops that reminds you not to mess with this hard a**! I love it and will buy it every year. """All hail Maharaja!""""
"Had a pint of this on tap at my favorite local movie theatre. Poured into a pint glass. Deep orange-ish brown, with a frothy white head. Smells and tastes of strong, sweet citrusy hops. Nice malt center, with a big hop presence. Fairly heavy body - very drinkable - I'm a big fan of this beer; one of the best surprises I've had in a while."
"I shared this with a friend to celebrate the adoption of his second child. Cheers, Shawn! May Audrey grow up slow and sure."
"This is a very good DIPA. It reminds me a good deal of Bell's Hopslam; too bad it's so rare in these parts. If you're a DIPA fan, you should definitely try this if you can find it. Recommended."
"D-Could drink this one all night long."
"A well crafted extreme beer that might be worth sampling as it ages, but only for a limited time."
"Oh how I love the well crafted IIPA's. This beer poured a dark amber with a white head. The smell is of alcohol and oranges? The taste is wonderful, the 10.5% alcohol is very well hidden by the flavor not so much in the smell. This is an easy drinking beer that feels nice and its high alcohol and it tastes good! Right up my ally I will have to thank my beer guy for suggesting this one."
"D - The beermaker clearly has his act together as this is the finest imperial I've tasted to date, and given the other BA reviews, my opinion is not unique. Splendidly wonderful, drinkable stuff."
"CHEERS!"
"had on tap at Zeno's in state college. this is an AMAZING beer. it is hard to have a good ipa/hoppy beer these days that stands apart from the rest. thanks to a recommendation from JP the bartender - i had a glass of this. wow - great beer. poured with a nice head. good golden color as well. the smell and taste are out of this world. might be my new favorite ipa."
"The Maharaja is fantastic I'm happy to finally have it on draft. It pours with a healthy amount of head and orange amber color. There is a strong pina colada sent emminating out of and over comming the frosted glass. It starts out with a piney hop attack with a short break of big clean almost sweet malty body. Than it's right back with a huge hops profile stanting with a pina colada citric sweetness. Moving on to citric grapefruit rhine like bitterness ending with a white pepper like hop finnish. Refreshing."
"My 1st impression of this beer was Ok and over rated. I drank it right when it came out, maybe beer like wine suffers from bottle shock? My friends over the coming weeks were really impressed with the beer buying large quantities of the Bombers around town. Judgement reserved with higher hopes for the other bottle I bought."
"D - Wish I got more than a small sample."
"D: Drinkable, but not sure if I would want to drink one bomber at the a time. Not sessionable but I definitely look forward to having again."
"The finish is dramatically alcohol-heavy, and leaves a fairly strong hop bitterness. I enjoyed it, but it is definitely intense."
"Hazy,deep orange that I can barely see through.Big, thick foamy tan head that leaves nice fine, sticky lace on the glass.Smells like toffee, grapefruit and ripe bananas. Big complex flavors of toasted grains and fresh grassy hops smoothed out perfectly with a nice hit of sweet maltiness.Nothing dominates the palate, very well balanced.Pleasant bitterness that leads to a nice lingering warm honey alcohol quality in the finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel that is not overly carbonated.A damn fine beer that nails the style perfectly."
"I really enjoyed this, the smell was exceptional and the taste along with mouthfeel was diverse and wonderful. Great beer!"
"As with the previous 22 oz bomber, this beer is too biog for me to drink more than one at a sitting. That being said, this would be a good beer to start with before you move on to lesser hoppy brews."
"An excellent beer that Hopheads will thoroughly enjoy."
"Awesome beer. I think you should leave now to get some."
"D - Just a big, big, hoppy IPA. Not the most refreshing thing, but loaded with flavour and hophead's delight."
"As drinkable as a beer as big as this can be, this one is exceptionally smooth and wonderfully tasty. A bomber's good for me, though."
"T/M- Real heavy, meaty hop character. Winey even greater still, lots of fermented grape notes as well as some ripe citrus fruits and a grainy corn whiskey like feel, dried apples and some booze. It got more intense in its hop bite as the beer warmed up. Its body thickened up as well. Very coating and a light helping of carbonation. Smooth going down until about 20 minutes out of the fridge, than this thing becomes a chore to get down. I love IIPA's but wasn't completely charmed by this one. I enjoyed the complexity and its very powerful hop profile but i think its downside are its balance, body and drinkability issues."
"Great, now I want one...gotta go before the price goes up, see ya."
"Not something i could kick back quickly or on a real regular basis, but overall a great brew and i'll get another for sure when it comes my way again."
"D: Maharaja is a strong, bold, and powerful DIPA. At over 10% though, it's on the strong side for the style. The flavor profile is not quite as dynamite as I expected, but it's still very drinkable for a 10% ABV brew."
"D- Outstanding all the way around brew. Very well done and goes down so easy."
"Mar 2011/apr 2013: have revisited this fresh...nose is tropical fruit with an oniony/banana/earthy/garlic note...not much of the latter but simcoe? Not that citrusy. No chill haze-clear. thick and syrupy. Pretty decent but more like a hopslam/hercules/gubna combo than the perfection that is dreadnaught."
"HV"
"D: This one is hard to knock back quickly. The hops just add too much bitterness and the alcohol has some warming effect as well. It is an excellent beer, but is not sessionable for me."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"Drinkability- I'm surprised to say it, but this is actually better than it is in the bottle. Damn near a perfect DIPA."
"As mentioned, this one drinks a little hot from the alcohol...almost slightly astringent. The components are quite nice but more beautiful chemistry is in order."
"The alcohol is hidden fairly well. I had some hints of it at first but that has mellowed out. I would certainly seek this beer out again."
"D - Definitely not a session beer, although the flavors do not tire easily. The ABV would get you eventually."
"The one draw back I feel is that this beer isn't as spring fresh as it could be. It has all the right flavors but I think they are slightly muted. Not poorly muted but enough to make me miss abundant, cheap, fresh hops. Besides that I can't say anything else poor about this beer. It looks good, it tastes good, it smells good. Buy some before I get to your store and buy it before you."
"Very classy, very well structured, very well resolved."
"No need to overanalyze this. If you want one of the tastiest, biggest, fullest flavors this style can offer, you won't find many more worthy examples than this. It's an enormous wallop of flavor without being over the top. I'll be if this had more """exclusive""" (ie. limited) distribution like Alesmith, Russian River and Three Floyds versions of the style, it would be hailed alongside those. That's beer-nerd elitism for you. All hail Avery...once again."
"D: This is a big beer, definately not for the novice. One 22 oz. bomber at 10.54% ABV is more than enough. This is a good offering for the style. Skal."
"Pours a very deep copper amber with a big creamy white IPA head; a big looking beer. Aroma is very strong and can be smelled a room away. Big on the pine forest with a lot of molasses. Hops dominate; a thick smelling brew. Taste is strong as the hops immediately take over, piney and citrusy, has decent semi-sweet malt backbone, but the bitter hops overwhelm. Alcohol is pretty noticeable A good brew, but not one of the more easy drinking DIPAs. A slow sipper."
"D- The extensive aging gave it a much more mellow taste than most other IIPAs that I have had. I would love to try a fresh bottle to get an idea of what the years of waiting for me to come along and drink it did to the beer. It was delicious though and as with all Avery brews I've had previously I would not hesitate to have another."
"smell is a huge burst of grapefruit, intense hop blast. tase is more of the same, but but the malt fines its way through, out of balance, but balance is overrated in dipas. a bit hot from the alcohol, a think a bout a year or ten will serve this beer well. all in all this is the best avery brew i have had to date."
"Overall very good DIPA and I'm glad I came back to give it a second chance."
"A rich cedar color with a thin tan head. Not the best retention due to the 11% abv. Big bouquet of tart citrus hops with some sweet candy malts and spicy alcohols. A collection of bitter and piney hops with citrus fruits. Not as complex as the nose lead me to beleive. Medium body with nice carbonation. A tasty double IPA."
"Will have to revisit at slightly warmer temp."
"A beer I will definitely seek out and hoard."
"Smooth, medium bodied. Nice finish with a subtle lingering bitterness"
"Drinkability is modeate. At 10.5% ABV and 102 IBU's it's a monster, but quite good."
"Overall a nice double, not an outright hop bomb, but not short on it either."
"D: Smooth feel and a well-balanced and non-abrasive hop feel make this almost too easy to drink. That being said, nothing about it really sticks out. Is it really good? Yes. Is there anything that makes it way different than other IIPA's? Not really. I mark it up because it's soooo drinkable, but from a flavor standpoint it's nothing out of this world."
"I came in here hoping for something special and this really didn't live up to. I highly recommend if you try this to do so with some friends. There are certainly things here to like, but it doesn't come together for me."
"Notes: Good but not quite stellar. Avery's regular old IPA is better. Just goes to show, stronger ain't always better."
"D: A quality Double IPA from Avery in Colorado, the price in bottles prohibits me from buying this except for every so often, but it's a quite good beer for hop fans."
"This is very yummy. There are many IPA's that are good, but this one is stellar. This is a big beer that has a very high hoppy flavor, but a very good malt balance. For those who like IPA beers this is a must try. Smooth and tasty all around. One of my top IPA likes."
"d - for a DIPA and considering its 10.54% it has some very nice complexity's. It is much tamer than i would have imagined but yet it boasts a ton a flavor."
"Pours a golden amber in color with lively carbonation and big, fluffy white head. Some lacing down the glass. Spicy, earthy scents. Some perfume and pine. Grapefruit. Good taste well balanced with sticky sweetness. Big, resinous hops. Pretty drying, highly carbonated mouthfeel but kind of thick and syrupy at the same time. A bomber isn't a problem, much more just isn't right. A good one but not among the best."
"M/D - Easy drinking and very smooth. The almost 10% could be tricky."
"This beer begs to be drank, just not with a pakastani beer."
"Pours a vibrant dark orange color, with an off-white somewhat creamy head. Nose is very similar to Bells Hopslam, but with more of a malt background to give the intense grapefruit some backbone. Really smells of great citric fruit. The nose leads you to believe that there is going to be something incredibly interesting and possibly maybe quite a balance to the hops, but that doesn't happen. Intense hop pine, roasted grapefruit which is interesting but doesn't add a balance to the alcohol. Surprisingly there is a creamyness throughout the whole palate with the malts! Very tasty, although showing a little more alcohol than i would like. Just like rolling into a club, and seeing the hottest hop from a distance and you want to take that hop home for sure. After some hardcore krunk dancing, the dance is over and the lights turn on to reveal that miss hoppy isn't as treal as you thought. Even though you aren't 100% down, you still put that hop in your whip and take it home. Also you roll that hop in some peanut butter."
"Taste, well kind of like Victory Hop Wallop minus the grapefruit. It could have a touch more malt that in my opinion would round it out a bit more. Overall, but this beer."
"D - Good brew that will snake up on you if you let it. One of the better Avery offerings that I wish was a year round distribution."
"another fantastic beer from avery, they must have some real hopheads in their brewhouse. pours a beatiful copper color with a nice white head that laces quite well. smell is great as well, has a wonderful piney hops aroma, i somehow pick out some grape accents, dunno if i'm crazy or what. taste is fantastic, a superb DIPA great flavor, a sticky hoppy thick syrupy brew. one of the best beers i've ever had."
"Clear copper with a robust off-white head. Ripe citrus nose with a touch of sweet biscuit malt. Initially a pervasive but soft grapefruit rind bitterness spreads across the palate, but a balancing malt sweetness is not underrepresented. Hops are a bit raw and green, turning from citrus to leafy mid palate. The mouthfeel is buoyant and full, with plenty of fine carbonation and a slight viscosity. Malt is nicely integrated with the bitterness, and doesn't get too estery or cloying, but it gets close. Some nuances of tea and earth come through as it warms. Finishes big and bitter. Overall a nicely done beer; well balanced, complex flavors with an excellent mouthfeel. A nice double IPA with no real faults but not particularly outstanding in any way either. A bit pricey."
"A kickass DIPA. I'm glad I bought several even if they were $8 a bottle. My favorite Avery beer to date."
"This was a doozie of any IPA. About knocked my socks off. Poured a caramel color with a wicked eggshell head. Smells of piny, citrusy, floral, straight up hops. Tastes just like that and the hop oil coats your tongue like syrup on pancakes. I could only stand one 22oz bottle or else my tongue would go numb."
"D - this is a great beer. the alcohol content is high but not noticably so. wow. i was excited to try this and it didn't disappoint."
"Had on tap at Moan and Dove. Appearance was murky amber colors with a thin head. The aromas were awesome woody smells of very, very hoppy flavors and citrus. Very sharp taste: almost syrup-like in sweetness with tons of hops and citrus flavors. Although I felt like I was drinking something thickly sweet, this drink had a great mouthfeel that aided in its great carbonation. Overall, a very strong and awesome drink."
"D: The '08 version had more alcohol than '07, yet it was hidden better. It's still not one of my favorite DIPAs, but overall it's a pretty solid offering."
"Had on on-tap at Brickstore in Atlanta. Presented to me with a deep amber color with a good head on top of it. Smell is citrusy and piney. Taste is very hoppy. Not much of a malt backbone on this one, but it's a nice change of pace. This one had a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Overall, a solid IPA, and a good beer from Avery."
"On tap at Julian's in Providence. Pours clear amber with a white head. Strong grapefuit/hop aroma. Hop taste presents very strong up front. Very strong grapefruit and pine notes. Bitter finish slides into citrus notes. Nice hoppy character, and flavorful. While I appreciate the strong hop character of Maharaja, the ber doesn't have a strong enough malt backbone. The malts get a little dominated here. Still a good beer."
"Deep, clear amber-golden-copper with an almost off-white head. Aromas of citrus rinds - sweet perfume-y grapefruit. The flavor is sweet light caramel malt and a thick coating of those citrus-y hops. The body here is the standout. It is silky and creamy; a smooth blend of hops, malt and alcohol sweetness that seamlessly blends together to create a pancakes with syrupy glide across my tongue and down my throat. There are beers with more hop character than this and beers with more alcohol, but this is my very favorite Imperial IPA for the best balancing of hop/ malt/ alcohol in this style with a mouth feel like boozy velvet."
"OVerall: I have had the pleasure to have this both on tap and in the bottle and I prefer tap in this case because of the freshness and being able to taste the fresh hop glory. If you like IIPA's and you see this at the store and have not tried it, you should buy it as a compulsive necessity."
"Overall, a defining beer for an imperial IPA."
"Notes: For all the praise this beer receives, I'm a bit dissapointed. I'm really hoping my next bottle is better."
"Pours a rich semi cloudy amber color in a snifter with a big lasting, dense offwhite head. Looks really nice. Smell is piney and fruity, and intensely hopped with notes of fresh sweet pineapple as well. Taste is equally as intense with loads of hops. Bitter pine flavor with a lot of pink grapefruit and bitter rind in the finish. A touch astringent at times, but almost seems to mellow a bit as it warms. Some tea flavors at moments, and an appropriate amount of sweet fruity malt to balance just enough. Quite drinkable, and a really good all around DIPA that hides the alcohol very well for over 10%. Great beer that I'd like to try again for sure."
"Amazing citrus and floural hops auroma. The flavor is amazing with the perfect balance of grapefruit, or citrus, and carmel. For a high gravity beer, this one is very drinkable."
"Poured from 22oz bottle marked Feb 2008 batch 7. Poured into New Belgium Snifter with a copper red hue and thick off white head that foamed up two fingers, also very good lacing. Smell is sweet mixed with pine and citrus, would say that its a lot different from batch 2 I tried in the past which smell like dank pot( and no I wasnt smoking any before). Taste is heavy on the grapefruit and pine resin flavors with a a sweet malt backbone, I have to say while good its a could be a little bit better balanced with the bitterness level and hop flavor. Mouthfeel is medium body close to a barleywine with an excellent medium to low carbonation level. While at 10.54 ABV its very drinkable for the alcohol I find the bitterness is a little over the top but still a very good beer, just remember being better in the past."
"D: I regret not having someone to share this with"
"Pours a nice clear amber/orange color with good white head. Smell is mostly spicey flavor hops and malt. Taste follows, spicy hop flavors mixed in with some good grapefruity hop taste and a solid malty backbone. Mouthfeel is what it should be for a good DIPA. Drinkability is suprisingly good considering this batches abv is listed at 10.54%. a good DIPA, and one I will buy again when looking for good balanced hop flavors without a palate thrashing hop bite. Thanks to sprucetip for the brew!"
"This is comfort beer for hopheads. I'm going to buy a few more bottles."
"Bought from South Bay Liquor. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Dark orange/brown color with a large head that fizzes away into a thin layer of foam. Smells great. Grapefruit, resiny hops, and caramel underneath. Taste starts off a touch bready, then the hop bitterness kicks in, which finally fades to a citrus flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy. Highly drinkable for a Double IPA. Overall this beer is very good."
"My bottle reflects differently from above stated ABV showing 10.54% with an OG of 1.090. Batch 7 Bottled in Feb. 2008."
"D: I almost always like beer on tap better. This beer isn't quite an exception... everything was just as good except the aroma was lacking. I don't know why... it's completely fresh... but it is. Damn good brew, nonetheless. And very easy to drink for an explosvie DIPA."
"D - this beer is quite tasty and really enjoyable, but I think 2 tops would be my limit before having to switch to something else. Still, a big DIPA that I always really, really enjoy"
"Mouthfeel is slick and very luxurious. It is about as drinkable as a +10 ABV beer can be. I think that Hog Heaven has a better hop character. Much cleaner yet being pungent and in your face at the same time. Still the Maharaja is delicous and highly recommended."
"Pours a solid amber/orange color with a very impressive head. The head leaves some lace, but not much. The nose is heavily of hops and citrus fruits. Upfront the taste is very hoppy, then more flavors begin to come out; cherries, grapefruit, moderately malted barely, and even a bit bready when I really concentrate on it. This is a very nice, very aggressive Imperial IPA - well done Avery."
"I'm in love with this IIPA from Avery. Nicely balanced and so easy to drink it's scary."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As afore mentioned some alcohol warmth. A damn fine beer, I'm definitely going to be drinking this one again, it is worth the price."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"I only picked one of these buggers up when I was in Portland, I really really want more! A whole case!"
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I'll finish the bomber with no difficulty. Not bad... although not my favorite either. Would mellow with age. Hop-Heads would love this! 102 IBU!"
"Poured into a snifter; it's a clear burnt orange color with some medium carbonation and a light tan head about a finger and a half thick that lasts quit a while... there is some thin lacing all around. Its aroma is very fruity and has a strong grapefruit smell that makes my mouth water. It has a rather dull flavor for its smell, but it is filled with hop flavors and very little malt flavors and has a slight alcohol twang and even has a slight smokey aftertaste... its pretty smooth. It has a medium-to-light body that really warms up your mouth. This is really a great tasting beer, I'm not that much of a hop head, but I will be buying this one again... and very soon too."
"Really like this one. Would highly recommend it to any hop head out there."
"I lack the beer vocab to truly do Maharaja justice, but I'll just say it's a fantastic beer and the best IPA I've ever had to date. My only complaint is that I didn't discover this beer years ago. I could drink way too many of these."
"Pours a nice peanut butter amber with honey edges. Big pillowy white head soaps off around 3 fingers thick then disipates to a thin layer atop the beer. Clings to the edges of the glass for all its worth. Smell is big hops, piney hops. Only thing I can compare to is smelling fresh hops while home brewing. HOPS! Taste is a bit more mellow than the smell though, starts sweet, white bread/buscuitty flavors, orange zest and then POW, big citrus hops and pine needles dipped in hop oil in your face. Beautiful obliteration of the taste buds. Mouthfeel is suprisingly creamy yet finishes dry making your mouth crave the next assult of hoppliteration. Nice."
"I've been waiting for this one a while and can't wait to dig in. Pours copper with reddish hues into a snifter. The slight head recedes quickly with little lacing left behind as streaks of carbonation swim briskly for the top. The bold hops and citrus aromas attack immediately and let you know you're in for some good times ahead. Tastes of oranges with a hint of sour apples in the background. The hops aren't as bold as the smell would have you believe, but they do hit the palate fairly aggressively. Just before the malt balance enhances the experience, the astringent qualities become apparent. I think I poured this one a bit too cold, because after it warms up, all the aforementioned qualities blend and accentuate each other better. Has a full bodied mouth-feel, yet goes down pretty smooth. Drinkability is higher than expected, as all the elements work together cohesively. Grand brew from one of my favorite breweries. Worth the wait, and will revisit soon."
"This is my new favorite DIPA."
"D: Very tasty, drink slightly lighter than 10.5% ABV, but not by much. A beer to drink AS a session."
"This bottle probably mellowed out over the 10 months since bottling. I'm very pleased with the results, but I'm going to have to track down a fresh bottle for comparison."
"I've been waiting for this one to come to the state for a while and boy am I not let down at all. Bottled on March 4th, about as fresh as its going to get! Pours a very slightly hazy orangish color topped with a beautiful dense 1/2 inch head that leaves nice lacing and is not too quick to settle to a nice ring. Words don't do the smell justice. A nice dose of pine balanced with some citrus. The taste combines the hops with some sweetness, thanks to the high O.G. Its like drinking a candied hop cone. The mouthfeel is rather light considering how big this beer it. The alcohol is well hidden but lets you know that it is there. An absolute must for any hophead. I love this beer so much that I don't want to drink it. I want to build a temple or a shrine to it and pray at it. Highly recommended."
"I will seek this out again."
"Forgot how much I love this beer and the first time I have enjoyed it on tap. I hope they don't blow throw it quickly because I already want another."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability is really dangerous for me! This is one of my absolute favorite DIPAs, so to have it fresh on cask at the brewery for such a reasonable price, I could be here all night!"
"This thing is thick and creamy and just plain juicy. Really well done."
"As with most IIPAs that come in 22oz bombers, it's not really a sessionable beer. I did notice that this was bottled about a full year ago, even though I just got it at the store recently. This might have something to do with the lack of noticeable hop taste (compared to others in the same style). I'm definitely going to try and find a fresher bottle and see how differently it tastes. This one wasn't very enjoyable but I'm hoping the date had something to do with that."
"Overall a great brew-- one I will have again!"
"For me this was quite possibly the most satisfying Double IPA I have had to date."
"Excellent. My new top DIPA!"
"Overall, this is a serious IPA with a big reputation to uphold. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was a good drinking session with lots to occupy and educate. This is a great beer, but for me not very sessionable, probably thanks to the 10.54% ABV. Still, highly recommended for fans of the style that want to move above and beyond the basics."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Easy to drink all 22oz in a hurry."
"Mix this 50/50 with a Dogfish Head 90-Minute and you're in for a treat!"
"Sometimes I like the Maharaja better than at others. Lately, I have been impressed. What I used to not like about it was overbearing bitterness, but I am noticing more citrus hops. In other words, it's similar to the Avery single IPA, but with more bitter, grassy hops, and they are both distinguishable. I used to prefer the single, now I think I like the Maharaja better. In a nutshell, it's a double with a multi-dimensional nose and a taste consistent with the nose, and no big surprises. If anything is lacking, it's refinement and subtle flavors that come out with time (for example, as with Stone's Ruination)."
"Maharaja is fabulous, and the high ABV (9.70%) never becomes obstreperous. A fantastic DIPA, this makes my short list of favorite DIPAs and IPAs. A treat not to pass up; you'll thank yourself later."
"Drinkability - Very good, I could see myself drinking this more often than not. Good buy."
"Overall, great stuff. Easy to drink for such a thick, heavy beer. A beer I could drink over & over again, and not get tired of."
"Carbonation is nice and despite the richness in body, the finish is bone dry."
"D - Outstanding. There really isn't anything about this one not to love...I couldn't drink more than one bottle though. An outstandingly complex and satisfying DIPA. This doesn't have quite the malt muscle of other top notch DIPAs though, but it makes up for it with the earthy herbal complexity and juicy freshness."
"Drinkability: One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. That being said, it's a sipper, despite the lack of alcohol taste."
"I really like the flavor of this beer, but the notable presence of the alcohol is somewhat of a deterrent. Even among other high ABV IIPA beers, I notice the alcohol taste and feel in this more than most."
"Avery has this one right. I've enjoyed several of their brews now, definitely worth trying this one. Really good beer."
"A really great Double IPA overall. Very drinkable."
"D - HELL YEAH! I have found my #2 favorite brew. If you enjoy the experience of Stone's Ruination, then you'll definitely enjoy this offering from Avery."
"Excellent carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel."
"This is a very fine IPA and very enjoyable, quite a nice surprise. The beer pours a nice cloudy, tawny orange with plenty of tannish head and lacing. The head is thick and creamy and somewhat billowing, and you will find some nice yeasty bits floating in the glass, but not lots. The smell is thick piney hops, sweet malts, grapefruit, and very enticing. I did knock it down a little in that the smell thinned out too much after the initial pour. It's nice nevertheless. This beer is a full bodied, thick, syrupy, moderately carbonated IPA that is very tasty. Plenty of piney hop notes, resinous hoppy esters, lots of grapefruity tang and subtle sweetness, plus some other sweetish citrus flavors that are difficult to pin down. I detect some rind, some spices, and some slight flowery hints as well. This beer improves as it settles. This is a wonderful ale for a cold day. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy on the tongue, there are some warming alcohol notes, but the 9.7% ABV is very well concealed overall. There is a little throatiness with this beer in the finish and beyond. This is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"The hops are the main attraction on the palate as well. Tastes of grapefruit, a bit piny and sweet malt that comes through more than I thought it would."
"Pours a semi-cloudy amber/gold with an absolutely insane head. Huge head sticks around for the long haul leaving intense lacing. Beauteous. Smell is sticky sweet like a good barleywine actually. Huge sweet malt presence and citrusy aromas in the nose. Taste is more sticky sweet malts blended with a great hop profile. Citrusy, juicy, bitter, very balanced. I have had this once before and dont remember it being so balanced. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is velvety, pretty heavy, decent carbonation. Delicious and hugely enjoyable. If I could handle it, I would drink a fair share of this."
"This is one damn fine beer. Top notch. The first Avery I have tried and it looks like I will venture further into their offerings if this one is representative of the quality."
"D - not worth the price of admission for me."
"Served to me with a 1 1/2 white, fluffy head that went nowhere for a good 3 minutes. It just sat there, looking so delicious. The beer itself is a warm orange-yellow cloudy color. The smell was like getting hit in the head with a sack full of hops. It was so earthy, piney, and flowery, with citrus (especially orange) all around. Someone was sitting next to me and asked me if I had windex in my glass. Despite that analogy, I thought the smell was fantastic, and it made me very excited to try to beer. The taste was powerful, but not as much as the smell. Obviously, the name of the game was the hops, which gave a strong, dry, nearly stinging linger to each sip. But there was also a warm alcoholic taste, notes of citrus fruits, and some sweet substance. A meduim body and light carbonation made this a great sipping beer that still won't let you take your mind off of it. In the end, I definately enjoyed getting it, but I thought it was a bit too potent for my tastes."
"D: Quite a bit more drinkable than other Imperial IPAs that try to go way over the top. That being said, it does not live up to the expectations I had for this particular offering. The mouthfeel seemed a bit weak, and the flavor profile was rather thin, especially for an assertive style. Balance was obviously more skewed to the hops, but the sweetness of malt did not seem to fit as well as it could have. Nevertheless, worthy of a taste, as this does feature some incredible aromas and varying hop varieties while attempting balance."
"At $7.99 a bit pricey, but was certainly worth the try."
"d: definitely provides a kick over 9%, but a good mix of hops & malts"
"M/D: A little high on carbonation, full bodied, definate sipper but good drinkability."
"Overall, a very impressive brew. Very refreshing. Very well made."
"Na Zdravje"
"pours a rather deep orange amber, the head starts big but dissipates to some very nice lacing. Smell is slightly sweet, with a big wiff of citrus hops. The taste has a solid hop backbone, mostly tasting of citrus and piny hops. However more balanced with malts then many of the style and some nice warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is heavy, but not for the size of the beer. Overall a good example of the style."
"The drink ability is good on this even though the alcohol isn't extremely well hidden, but one bomber is more than enough for me."
"D: Frickin awesome beers. Might be my favorite beer. If oyu like hops, this is the beer for you"
"This beer packs a serious bite. Gone are the fruity notes in the aroma, making way for a plethora of hops that dominate the palate. Carmel malts balance the finish, but the main show belongs to the hop assault. The carbonation level is perfect, and the mouthfeel is slightly viscous, crisp, and leaves a bitter punch down the back of the throat that you won't soon forget. Wow, I almost completed writing review without a single mention of the alcohol. It's nearly non-existant from the taste, but (since I'm mentioning it now) it makes its presence known within the first half-dozen ounces. Bottom line: I love this beer. Easy to drink, complex, tasty, and for hop-heads, it's an absolute must."
"Delicious, but not the most drinkable IPA. At its price, I'd have a hard time buying this over a few others on the market, but well worth the purchase."
"Would have again, especially if I see it at Holingshead's Deli in Orange on tap again some time"
"Pours an orange copper with a slight chill haze. Fluffy 2 finger off-white head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is great. Peppery floral hoppyness. Malts in the background with a definite alcohol presence. Taste is also good. Lots of floral hops with a spicy piny blast followed by a smooth malty sweetness. Caramel and toasted pale malts balance out well. Mouthfeel is thick, but dry and the carbonation level is spot-on. Overall, another excellent beer from Avery brewing Co. I think I'm gonna have another..."
"D: I can't believe its 10% ABV. This is a must try for any hophead."
"RIP Michael Jackson March 27, 1942 - August 30, 2007"
"Drinkability: Terrible, can only drink one, if that, too much alcohol, too much hops, too bitter. Not a fan, wouldn't buy it again. If you want high alcohol, and strong hops, try it, you may like it."
"Very nice beer. would prefer it to be finish drier so that the pint is less sweet on the lips."
"Thanks to seaoflament for this beauty of an extra. Pours a pure and clear copper with lively carbonation, huge head that takes it's time and laces all over and throughout. Smells of big pineapple, some orange and mild hops for a DIPA. Nice though. Tastes of huge juicy pineapple and a hint of orange rind. Malty and a finish of bitterness from hops but very subtle for a DIPA and doesnt linger or fry my palate. Very very balanced and delicious. Not a hop bomb but I dont mind that since is has some juicy fruit present. Medium in the mouth and ABV is non existant. This is a dangerous brew. Very tasty, drinkable and refreshing yet another bomber would leave me crosseyed. Had no idea that this was out there but would gladly pick it up if I saw it."
"On draft at Sunset Grill in Allston, MA. Pours a rich copper with no head or carbonation. Smells of hops plucked fresh from the vine. The taste is of overwhelming goodness. Honestly, it's tough to get much better than this. Not overly sweet, which is nice. I'm in love."
"Drinkability: Good! Impressed by this one. Somewhat limited by the alcohol content."
"D - A bit too heavy for drinking on its own, so a good food pairing is recommended when opening up your own bomber. A nice interpretation of the style that is sweeter and more grapefruity than many of its counterparts."
"The mouthfeel on this was almost perfect. It had an almost creamy texture and it coated my whole mouth. Drinkability was good but the alcohol was definately present and took its hold mid bottle. I was definately impressed with this beer and if I get the chance I will definately be picking up another."
"Overall: an outstanding DIPA, and one that well earns my high rankings. It could be improved on, for sure: like another twenty pounds of hops per barrel. But it's real damn good for a mass produced and distributed DIPA. My only complaint is that's it's a little too balanced in a style which, of all styles, should not be balanced."
"Feels thick in the mouth, but never manages to coat more than the roof of the mouth. So acrid and clean are the first and last notes. Exceptionally drinkable for a beer of either this hop character or this body, let alone both."
"This was the beer that a an old high school friend told me that when you get to heaven they hand you a Maharaja. The taste grabbed me then and does again for an actual tasking. It gave a nice blond head, with a slightly dark overall color. Both the smell and taste lets the grapefruit taste come through. And important to me, the taste stayed through the whole 22 oz. bottle. A pleasure to drink and reminded me that lesser beers in the past might have had a good initial taste, but the taste left quickly and the rest just tasted like beer. With the Maharaja, after the last sip, I wanted more."
"Recommended"
"D: Slightly high ABV with an initial specific gravity of 1.085. This is a good beer to drink slowly while chatting with friends."
"D- A little boozy and heavy, but it truly is an imperial IPA."
"This one goes right onto the short list of my favorite DIPAs. Awesome brew."
"Overall, this brew rocks! Great taste, great balance and a great session. The only bad thing about this brew is that it came to a finish. I'll revisit this one again. Enjoy."
"D: Here's a tip: drink this one with a friend and you will be sure to have a good time if you both are hopheads or enjoy hops to a reasonable about, because drinking a whole big bottle of this by yourself is not recommended. Still the best DIPA I've tried to date in my young life."
"Drinkability is above average but not the best of the style. There are penty of big IPAs that fly out of the glass but this just isn't one of them. I'm glad that I tried this beer but there are far better examples of the style available."
"Very drinkable, if you're a hop head. I personally love Simcoe hops, and this beer delivers them."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a shaker. The bottle label states that it was """Bottled in June of 2006, Batch 4.""" This double IPA poured a cloudy, orangish color with a two-finger thick beige head that slowly faded away, leaving some sticky, thick lacing around the glass. The aroma consisted of an extra strong piney hop essence with a very heavy dose of caramel and toffee. The flavor was heavy on the caramel malt with a big underlying grapefruit bitterness. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and resiny with a very light amount of carbonation. Very tasty!!!"
"This is from 1 pint 6 oz bottle from batch 6, bottled in may 2007 (charles st). the initial pour gave rise to a beautiful cream colored head which was just as soft and cloudy on the lips as it looked in the glass. the smell of tangy citrus immediately filled my nostrils with a ton of hops not far behind it. the taste was a bit coarse as the alcohol wasn't masked as well in the flavors and smell as i generally prefer, though this is a 9.7%. all 102 IBUs attacked my taste buds as the beer warmed its way down my throat. the initial blast of citrus, followed by a wave of hops, finished with a long and dry bitter finish made this one hell of a mouth full. the drinkability suffers a bit from the roughness of the alcohol, and i would have liked the hops to define the taste rather than the citrus. but all in all, a fantastic american DIPA. this would last for 18 trips to india."
"Nice big-bodied beer. One is plenty on this muggy evening."
"Cant wait to try a fresher one."
"This beer comes through on all points. This is one I will have again and again while I have it available. Of course, not a session beer, but an extremely well crafted IPA to rival the best of the west coast IPAs."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and bisquit malt scent along with a mild hop aroma. It's bitter with a warm malty feel. The taste is great. It has a wonderful hop wallop along with a solid malt bill that adds balance and an elevated abv. . It goes down easy with a bitter/bisquity finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's got excellent malt character as well as hop presence. It's bold, but within reason. It's balanced and very enjoyable."
"d- This is a hop-dominated ale that lives up to the DIPA billing, great flavor and aroma, but the abv is not very well masked and I don't think I could finish more than one bomber if I wanted to be coherent the next morning. If I was given this in a blind tasting I would have sworn it was from SoCal, not Boulder (another BIG beer from Avery)."
"This """Imperial""" IPA poured a murky copper hue, with a giant fluffy head. Lots of lacing as the brew is consumed. The smell is hops. Grassy and fruity. A touch of alcohol there as well. Taste is again grassy hops, tempered by a fair amount of caramel malts. A nice balanced blend. The alcohol is again noted in the mouth, leaving a bit of burn as the brew is downed. I found this offering to be only moderately drinkable."
"This is one dangerous beer. So incredibly delicious. The alcohol is hidden so well. I'm barely halfway through my glass and I can already tell that this is one to watch out for. Ahhh but temptation...I'll be having many more!"
"Pours a deep copper with decent clarity and a thick white head that goes away fairly soon but leaves excellent lacing. Hops fill the nose with wonderful notes of citris, pinneapple, and pine needles on top of biscuity/caramel malts. Mmm...flavorful hops dominate the palate with its zesty-tropical-citric-floral notes. Alcohol has its presence in the palate but the rich flavor of the hops make this bad boy quite drinkable and one to remember. Will definitely be enjoying this one again sometime soon."
"A supremely hoppy high gravity Double IPA, this beer poured copper colored with a nice foamy head and lacing that lasted forever. Smell very hoppy with definite grapefruit and floural odor with a light green grape scent. Taste was smooth for such a hoppy high ABV brew. As expected, the hops really stand out but its not completely out of balance. Mouthfeel is rather light with a slight alcohol burn on top of tongue. Drinkability depends on your tolerance for a stout beer. I'd never drink more than one per session but will definitely drink more."
"Copper coloures with nice clarity. Fluffy white head tops this delight off. Smell is second only to Masal Mama or Furious- pure hop bliss. Taste is a prickly piney tropical fruit hop shake. The malt tends towards the sweet side,but not enough to distract. just a goddamn tasty beer. Booze levels are not distinguishable- very drinkable and dangerous given the strength. Carbonation is spot on as well. Not much bad to say about this dipa. Would be a staple if I could get my hands on it. Best avery beer I've had."
"D: I could easily have 2 or 3 of these, especially on tap. I think the spicy pepperiness might get to my palate after that, but its a strong enough beer that I probably wouldnt need more than 2 or 3 anyhow."
"Well, it disappeared faster than expected so there is something to it. And, it is a big brew, but almost too big to be enjoyable. I correctly chose this as a nightcap, as the tastebuds are shot after it. Interesting, and I can appreciate big beers, but this was too over-the-top and almost lost under persistent alcohol and resin. Worth having once to try it, but I can't see returning to it."
"Bottle: Poured a light beige color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of funky yeast with some nice spices and light ester. Taste is also dominated by some sweet fruit notes as well as some spices and the funky yeast. Average body with great carbonation. I thought it was a bit too sweet for my own palate but still enjoyable overall."
"Overall, an excellent DIPA. Well balanced and tasty. Recommended."
"Drinkability- As good as such a big, hoppy beer can be. Seems to be a terrific example of the style. This is my first beer from Avery, and hopefully not my last. Cheers!"
"Well, I finally got to try this beer. Pours a tawny amber color with brilliantly white head. Aroma is intense citrus....VERY fruity. First sip hits you hard in the back of the tongue. Thats the IBU's baby. Rounds out nicely in the middle and some toasted and biscuit malts can be detected. What I like most about this beer is that for a DIPA, its rounded out very well. Two beers I have had a lot of that I might compare it to are Bell's Hop Slam and Founder's Devil Dancer. This lacks a bit of the depth that Devil Dancer has, but it is more drinkable. It's much more balanced that Hop Slam (which is way too """juicy""") so for me, this approaches what could be the perfect double IPA."
"According to the bottle Maharaja means: """great""" and """king""". Well let me be the first to welcome you to the kingdom of The Maharaja, because he RULES!!"
"D- It was an easy drinker considering the ABV, but I just wasn't blown away by this beer. A lot had been made of it and I think I may have set my expectations a bit too high. I would definitely drink this beer again, but I'm not going to seek it out at the going price. Noticing the date on the bottle, being a season out, I may have to give it another chance."
"Pours a dark caramel colored amber with a nice off-white head. The aroma explodes with resiny pine and citrusy hops and malt. The taste starts out pretty subtle with some malt but before long the hops explode in your mouth for a long bitter finish. Overall, this is a very nice IPA that delivers enough hops to satisfy any craving."
"Finely tuned IPA. Its strong, crisp, and tame - not extreme or over-the-top like some Imperial IPA offerings (not that theres anything wrong with that). It is also decently priced; thanks Avery. I like it and would get it again."
"Cheers!"
"Wow. I've never seen a prettier beer. Color is a orange-ruby red, head is ridiculous, being constantly fed by champagne bubbles rising from a golden bottom. Smell is pungent, sweet and delicious, with piney notes slightly overpowering citrus with sweet malt holding it all together perfectly. After the nose, the taste came as no surprise, powerful throughout and striking an enviable eveness. Creme broulee wrapped up in a fireworks display of delicious hops. Mouthfeel is silky, velvety, savory, surreal. This is the finest Double IPA I've ever had. Perfect."
"As good as this is I couldn't rate it perfect where drinability is concerned because of the price. Many fantastic double IPA's go for under $5 in my area and in my honest opinion $8 for this is just too much. If my local brewers are charging less than this for their hop bombs a brewery in Colorado should be too."
"Mouthfeel is good but drinkability is low here cause of the 9.7% abv."
" Oh, this is only a summer release, so stock up for those cold winter months"
"D: Not only the best DIPA I have had but also one of the best beers I have ever had. I would drink this all day if the ABV wasn't so high. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"giblet"
"Outstanding. Aroma is that of citrus & hops that get the senses going. Light but a great way to start this brew. Beautiful copper with a light head that quickly dwindles to a small cap in the glass. The taste is brilliant. Right there with the 471 from Breckenridge. Initial sip is sweet making you wonder what you are doing but the piney hops kick in and WOW, nice. Very smooth, and slightly warming as it goes down. Leaves the mouth dry and wanting more. Best Avery beer yet and the 9.9% is good for the soul. I am a sucker for DIPA's though."
"My favortie DIPA. Yes, i know I'm from San Diego aka """Home of the DIPA's""" but this is still my favorite one. Highly recommended."
"Full and even mouthfeel, shockingly drinkable for such a huge selection. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by an Avery beer, and this is certainly no exception."
"World class."
"D- The high ABV is well hidden. This was a great brew that I would have again. One was enough for the night though."
"On tap at O'Brien's. Great looking IPA- orangish red and super clear. Smell is quite pungent with citrus hops, and heat. The alcohol is present everywhere in this beer. It comes across as a little harsh and very bitter, and the bitterness seems much more alcohol-derived than from hops. Can't or wouldn't really want to drink that much of this beer."
"Overall an outstanding beer. One of the best double IPA's I've ever had. Ridiculously recommended."
"Bottle courtesy of brandonman63... thanks again!"
"Drinkability - The 9.7% ABV is well hidden on the flavor, but it is present on the way down. Another lazyboy beverage or possibly the last one on the way out. Good drinker; Avery rocks!"
"Mouthfeel-thick resinous malt body that is so laden with hops I am in heaven. Grapefruit and numerous citrus characteristics that are like nothing I have ever had. This is what I was hoping my Dreadnaught would be, no offense, but this Imperial IPA is over the top and I like it. The finish stays the same. A froth on the palate only intensifies the flavors and gets some of the malt sweetness to get past the hops. Well worth the wait! I had eaten earlier and after two glasses, I was done for the night. Almost a 5...."
"D - one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had. It's a close call between this and Stone's IPA. I think Stone is more of an IPA, but the delicate fruit aroma of papaya is a big plus for me (brings back memories of childhood excursions into Mexico). The bitter sweet grapefruit finish begs another sip."
"Appears a hazed orange copper hue with orange tined cream head formed large and thick rising above the rim of my glass, leaves an evenflow of bands of lacing around my chalice. Aroma is heavy on grapefruit peal and cut grass balanced with a sugar coating of light biscuit malt character the sweetness and fruit aspects really come through in this one. Flvors of citrus peel, grass, and mild pine combine on the palate upfront with strong bitterness but are balanced out by the large dose of malts with just enough biscuit sweetnss from the pale malts evdient alcohol not overdone at all. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with enough oily girth from the herbaceous to be fuller but still really smooth with even carbonation. Drinkability is incredible much better than their barleywine, triple, or quad but I could definitely enjoy many more of these especially if that near 10% alcohol allowed it."
"A: Slightly hazy amber-gold, head that retains fairly well. S: I've had a lot of double IPA's, and this is really outstanding. Hops that slap you in the face offset by a wonderful apricot-citrus note that really balances well. T: The balance continues, a nice rich malt backbone painted thickly over with hops. The fruitiness is what really makes this beer interesting, the grapefruit/pine/apricot that permeates the whole experience. M: Thick and chewy, moderate carbonation. D: I could drink this all night long. A really outstanding beer."
"D - No problem finishing this one. I might have it again if I find it on tap somewhere. Worth a try."
"D: This regal beer's only drawback is that it only comes in 22oz. bombers, and the high ABV will knock you sideways if you're not careful. Not """drinkable""" in the all night sense, but surely in the grab one whenever you can sense. Awesome beer!"
"D: One and done. This one was way too flat and boring for me. There are far better DIPA's out there. The abundance of alcohol didn't help things, either."
"Batch #5. Nice looking beer. Rustic orange with a nice white head and lacing all the way down. Smell is a mix of citrus of pine hops. Mandarin oranges come through with a bit of bitter rind. Incredibly juicy and fresh. Taste follows suit to the smell except more intense, and sugary malts are present but they take a back seat to the hops. Just enough bread and caramel to calm things down, but the hops dominate. Very rindy, but I don't see that as a bad thing as it keeps it from being too sweet. Creamy mouthfeel that remains light despite the abv. If it weren't for the price this would be my go to."
"I will definitely order this beer the next time I'm at Korova, a bar on the Commons in Ithaca, NY."
"Overall, this is a great double IPA. It is good for an hour of enjoying the smells and flavors. The flavor profile moves through 3 to 4 phases at every sip. I've had beers with this much alcohol that hide it completely. Given that this one gives a slight alcohol burn that interrupts the other flavors, I can't give it the """5"". Still, this is a supurb beer."
"Overall this brew is quite good. This is definitely comparable to Stone IPA with a bigger alcoholic kick. Schukria!"
"Highly Recommended."
"Drinkability - Excellent - I love it. The only thing that would limit the amount you would drink is the fairly high alcohol content. You wouldn't drink this all night - but I'd like too."
"bright copper/orange/reddish body sits hazily under a long-lasting 1.5 fingers of creamy foam. when i opened the bottle (and note that i was at work, after hours - a coffeeshop with VERY strong smelling, and quite delicious, coffee) the room was instantly full of piney, riseny, fresh-outta-the-woods-still-wet-from-morning-dew hoppiness, but also slight sweetness, and i mean SLIGHT, from the malts. taste is much expected from a DIPA, with a big (background of) toffee-ish, caramelly-sweet malts, and, yup, you guessed it, boat-loads of hops: juicy, resiny, piney, and finishes somewhat fruity. nice big, smooth moutfeel and well concealed ABV, but, this took me an hour or two to finish as i cleaned up behind the counter and in the shop... man, this ain't no lawn-mower beer!"
"According to the label, this beer was bottled in February 2007 (batch 5). Yellowish orange out of the bottle and hazy orange in the glass. A quarter inch head bubbled up from the pour, but dissipated pretty quickly leaving just a bit of foam around the edge. Aroma was strongly hoppy, floral, and a bit piney. Wow, what a hop profile! Tasted like it was freshly dry-hopped--I had an IPA on cask once with hops added directly into the cask, and Maharaja reminded of that. The mouthfeel was pretty clean (maybe a little bit of stickiness in the finish), not syrupy like Stone Ruination, but not thin or watery either. When the beer was cold, the hops completely dominated the malt (unlike AleSmith's and Sierra Nevada's IPAs); as it warmed, though, a bit more of the malty sweetness showed up. I liked it, but it was almost overpowering. I needed some Indian food to eat with it."
"A smooth ride for sure. One bomber is probably just about right for a warm spring Sunday afternoon."
"This is one hell of a dipa. It is one of the most sessionable that I have ever had. I highly recommend this beer."
"Recommended."
"Recommended."
"Strong citrusy hop aroma. Excellent dark orange color with lingering head. Pine abnd grapefruit flavors from hops predominate with a definite lingering bitterness. Balanced well by malt though with slight sweetness in the finish. Alcohol is present but not overbearing. Truly a great beer! I wish I could get it in Sacramento."
"This is a fantastic beer. Try it if you haven't. Avery's best beer in my opinion. Thanks for the awesome suggestion from the beer guy at Spec's in Austin. This beer is going to make its way into my beer rotation."
"Medium amounts of carbonation, medium bodied and slightly syrupy; this is really easy to sip. I'd imagine this as a good introduction into the style for newcomers or for people who don't like extremely bitter beers. The hops definitely make the finish moderately dry, but the scale of sweet-to-bitter favors on the side of sweet. I felt much more of the hops in the smell than I actually tasted. All-in-all, another great beer from Avery."
"Mouthwateringly acidic in the mouth and the head is still nice and soft on my lips...anyway- this is a good and drinkable Double IPA, pretty well-balanced."
"Drinkability: Fair, This is a great IIPA; however is very much an extreme beer. This limits your intake to about one bomber or so. It also has a odd harshness that makes it almost cloying after awhile."
"Just thinking about it makes my mouth wet."
"Pours a deep orangey amber with a small tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet carmel malts and hops. Taste is piney hops with some citrus hops and lots of sweet malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable for 10% ABV. Not my favorite DIPA, but very good."
"An exceptional beer! The pour was a perfect dark amber color with a super fluffy white head that left much lace on the glass. The smell was pure piny hops and a very small hint of orange zest which was very inviting. With the first sip, the pine flavored hops explode in your mouth and are almost too intense if not for the great malt balance that comes next, followed by a slight alcohol flavor in the finish. The great thing about the flavor is that the malt balance is not overly sweet, it is dry in a way and really does well to balance out the hops but not get in the way. This is and excellent beer and if you are a fan of hops, you will love it for sure!"
"Had a 12 oz. on tap and decided to split it with someone."
"This is an awsome DIPA! The hops and malt are well balanced, one doesn't overpower the other and this will certainly please a hophead but would also work well as an introduction to the style."
"Thanks to the World of Beer, in the past week I have had Hercules, 90 Minute, and Stoudts Douple IPA, and I can definitely say that Maharaja is a contender for my favorite Double IPA."
"Poured out a murky orange brown with a small tan head. Nose is fruity, grapefruity hops, some spice. The taste is lovely, grapefruit pith, some minor cherry, a bit of piney hops, very well balanced and accessible for such a hoppy and high ABV beer. Easy going body, not overly carbonated. Not particulalry cloying, actually very drinkable."
"Drinks fairly easy, a little to intense to session on, but I could if forced too! Still a bit pricey @ $6.50 a bomber"
"Pretty drinkable for a big and bold brew. Would fit in nicely into any hop head's session. I enjoyed this bomber all by myself and it just went down too easily, leaving me wishing for more. Will be buying this again soon."
"On tap at OBriens recently. Had the distinct pleasure of having a pint with Adam Avery at lunch. Pours a beautiful copper orange and red with a nice inch+ thick head that stayed around. Wow, does this beer smell terrific. Maybe its just a really fresh keg, but the pine and sweet citrus/grapefruit hops are just jumping out of the glass on this one. Obviously dry-hopped very well. Taste is all about the high alpha hops, but is very well balanced with a sugary malt backbone. Very hop candy-ish with a resinous, oily mouthfeel. Not hot with alcohol in the least bit. Smooth and terrifically drinkable. Not sure how the latest bottled version matches up, but this one is a winner. If I hadnt needed to drop fartingdog off at the SD airport, I would have stayed and drank several more throughout the afternoon. A rock solid IIPA."
"D- highly drinkable for a 2IPA, good flavor, nice balancing act, enjoyable, I'd have another, well done"
"Wow, what a great beer. This is a shining example of the style in my opinion. It's a big beer, but it's nicely balanced. I could definitely try to put back a couple of bombers of this. I would probably pay for it due to the 9.8% ABV. A must try if you can find it. Find it now. Drink it fresh."
"Overall - good beer, but IMO walks a fine line between barleywine and DIPA. I realize the two styles are similar, but I think this beer could fall into either camp depending on how fresh it is. Aged, it would make a very nice BW. Fresh, it has the hoppiness to bring it to true DIPA standards. I still think it could have more hop presence, most notably in the flavor area. Still a great beer and one I will be trying more often."
"Before taking 1st sip, color is nice and reminicent of amber. Smells strong of hops, and has a long fresh hop after taste. Has a bit of an alcohol after taste - not surprising for a 10%abv. Not for the faint IPA drinker, but definitely one I'll be ordering again soon."
"This was one of the most drinkable double IPA's I have had to date. With such a perfect melding of flavors, an almost undetectable alcohol presence, and an unparalleled """smoothness""" in regard to aroma, flavor and mouthfeel, this is truly an outstanding example of the style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and has a bit of a syrupy feel to it. At nearly 10% ABV, drinkability is limited. I think one bomber would suit me. Overall, this is a very good beer. Definitely recommended."
"D- Fairly drinkable for an imperial IPA... but what imperial IPA is not meant to be shared?"
"If you're a hophead, then trust me and buy a case of the Maharaja. Seriously, this is the real deal."
"Wow. Maharaja pours a burnt orange hue with a generous off-white head that stays well throughout. Lacing sticks quite well to the glass. Everything you can ask for in a DIPA in terms of smell: citrus (lemon, orange, pineapple) and pine, Pine, PINE! Taste is amazing. Taste was great with a little bit of everything. The hops overpower with a zesty straw background. Very floral in flavor as well, but not overwhelming in that aspect. Mouthfeel is smooth for such a potent DIPA. Carbonation is quite mild which I enjoy. Drinkability is there for a DIPA, but for someone who isn't used to such a powerful brew...watch out. This brew has really impressed me. Pick this baby up if you see it on the shelf!"
"10 oz. serving in a wine glass poured a cloudy golden orange with a thick head. Very interesting lace patterns left on the glass. I hope heaven smells like this beer. Mangos and cream. I love when brewers use hops and malts to such good effect. Tasted like the tropics -- ripe pineapple and rum. Creamy sweet with a slightly bitter finish. I wanted to keep drinking this all night, but I felt like they'd probably need a spatula to peel me off the bar. Going back soon for another."
"This is up there with Pliny the Elder, 3 Floyds and Hopsickle."
"Prosit MK"
"cheers!"
"Peachy orange with golden edges. Marshmallowy, dense, long-lasting, great-lacing, bright light khaki head fills up the top 2 inches of my Corsendonk glass. Very nice. Bright, hoppy nose featuring lemon rind, Scotch tape, pine, marmalade, and mint. Candy-coated fruit and butterscotch malt aroma is more evident as the beer warms. Butterscotch malt flavors up front, followed quickly by herbal, piney bitterness. Tropical fruits come in mid-palate with some warming alcohol. Hops turn a little citrusy and increasingly numbing and bitter. Grapefruit finish. Medium body with a sticky feel and plenty of carbonation. Well put-together, but not quite a top tier IIPA in my book. Still, I would love to try this fresher and on-tap."
"D: A sweet hop bomb in a bottle. High ABV limits the amount consumed in one evening. An interesting beer. Try it."
"Highly recommended for a hophead (and this would definitely include myself). Go try it at the very least."
"Overall this is a kick ass brew that should be tried. I'm able to buy Avery beers,but this is the first time I've seen this. Believe me, I will pick this up again."
"Batch 4. Very tasty. Pours a rich orange/amber with a thick head that sticks around for a while. leaves thin lacing, and only if left for a minute. Two quick sips leaves none. Has a distinct piney scent. Tastes very dry, very hoppy, matching the scent. Very good finish, leavin no lingering unpleasant tastes. Another great DIPA"
"During my pilgrimage to Half Time in Poughkeepsie, NY I mentioned to a few of the staff that I am a hophead. They immediately dragged me over to this beer and said I had to try it. WOW!!! A great IPA. Cloudy amber color, huge slightly off-white head that hangs in there at about 1/2 inch. Lacing is thick sheets. Aroma stands out as good as Celebration Ale. Hops, grapefruit and spiciness. I could inhale the whole 22 oz through the nose. The taste is exceptional, easily as good as Celebration Ale...hoppy....spicy... grapefruit and incredibly smooth. No hint of the 9.7 abv. Rich mouthfeel and highly drinkable. If I found this on tap somewhere, I would call this a session beer and deal with the after effects!!! This is a great beer for hopheads."
"Pours a lively tan head with dense bubbles over a clear amber body. Tons on citrusy, piney hops on the nose. This turned from a hop bomb to a nicely balanced IPA with the malts tasting wonderfully. Very smooth, but better fresh."
"Pours a slightly cloudy, perfectly gold color with a dense, sticky head that leaves lace on the glass but doesn't last to see it. Huge, resiny, piney, citric hop aroma that could probably be duplicated by sticking some Centennial hop pellets up your nose. At higher temperatures, some more earthy and fruity notes come out to play in the aroma. On the palate, thin, razor sharp mouthfeel and hops that will smack you around. Huge piney and resiny notes, with very little malt backbone -- massively imbalanced. Orange, mint, all the stereotypical flavors of American hops make an appearance here. It's got hop complexity in spades, but pretty much nothing from the malt end. This beer is like sucking on a hop pellet. Well, it's a little sweeter than that, if only from the ABV, but this seems to me a beer that only a hophead should love. Sure, I can look at this objectively and say it's a well-executed Double IPA, but that doesn't mean I'd want to drink it a second time. Good for the style, but it loses points for massive imbalance in my (utterly subjective) world."
"A deep amber color, with an inch and half head that forms. The head is creamy in color and laces slowly down the glass. A strong floral aroma hits the nose and is mixed with a string malt scent as well. That will soon be overshadowed by stronger hop fragrances of citrus, grass and pine. The taste starts with hearty malt flavor then rolls into an intense hop biterness of grapefruit and lemony citrus flavors, which lingers on the palate for sometime. It has a smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied at first and gets heavier as it reaches the back of the throat. An easy to drink IPA, the aroma is inviting, the flavor is strong, and the even feel, make this a must try beer for hopheads and a good beer for those wanting to try stronger IPA's"
"The body is medium to heavy. Carbonation is very smooth to the palate. Plenty of bitterness with a rough, grainy cohumulone. Also a lingering grassy finish with a hint of ethanol. Fairly drinkable. I can't wait to try a 2007."
"This was a very decent beer, one of the better double IPA's I have tried. The head and lacing were relatively long lasting. The smell was pretty strong, sweet and syrupy. Taste is a bit weaker than other DIPA's but very good none the less. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both above average."
"cat-piss, cat-box just a really poor taste and not what I am used to tasting in this beer. I think this beer was a lot better when it was 9.7% and I thought it was pretty good but now it is just a pungent (not in a good way) stinky mess, goddamn...this sucks."
"."
"Avery please return to making the 11 and make it a regular!"
"Comments: My first offering from Avery & well worth it. Very well balanced DIPA which masks the high ABV well behind the bountiful malt & hops. This one is a must for all hopheads!"
" Overall, I found the Maharaja to be slightly unbalanced, but still very approachable. I have a feeling that a few years in the cellar will turn this release into something almost magical."
"One thing I liked about this beer is that is seemed to change both sip to sip and as it warmed. Small changes, big changes, just a lot of changing, it was really odd, making it hard to review, but quite enjoyable. At first sip, I didn't think I'd give it such a high score, but as I'm finishing, I really enjoying it!"
"Pours a cloudy copper hue under a 1.5 finger beige head with nice contour and great retention, leaving lovely sheets of lace. The nose is crisp and strong of citrus and pine sap - very enticing. The mouth is quite viscous, coating the tongue, while the carbonation tingles the entire oral cavity. The hops are the main attraction here, strong, tangy and bitter, with a distinct pine tone and espresso-like dryness. Malt is a supporting actor, with a bit of caramel sweet to go with the grain. The finish is all pine, leaving a nice dry aftertaste. Very, very enjoyable."
"22oz. bottle poured a cloudy reddish/brown color with small white cap that leaves some lace around the glass. Smells of malt and yeast in the nose and taste big and malty with an equal portion of earthy, floral hops. It also has a yeasty thickness to the feel and leaves a bit of an alcohol dryness to the aftertaste. This brew is easy to drink and is very balanced between the malt and hops but doesn't seem to have anything that jumps out at me and I would probably not go out of my way to obtain this one again."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very good. Another great Avery product and another great DIPA."
"Notes: this is almost two different beers warm versus cold. When cold it's more crisp and dry with a woodsy lingering finish, while when it's warm it's dominated by juicy, fruity hops, an oily feel and alcohol in the nose and taste. All in all I though this was a good DIPA -- my favorite style lately -- but IMHO it doesn't measure up to some better versions I've had recently. At 9.9% ABV (according to my bottle's label), it does provide a nice buzz, however."
"Fresh on-tap at Pizza Plant, good example of style and quite drinkable when I am not a big fan of the style. Looks like an aged peach with small soap bubbly white head. Fruity aroma, a bit citrus. Taste is substantially grapefruit, and smooth. Last beer of evening as it is a direct impact on you taste buds from the hops. A lot of grapefruit and the malts to make it drinkabale and it is."
"Mouthfeel was slick and oily. Medium to full bodied."
"Drinkability: A little disappointing for the style. The hops seem to be overshadowed by the syrupy, creating an unbalanced DIPA. A decent beer, but not my top choice."
"Purchased this at grapes of mirth in columbus ohio, during christmas time. Poured into red wine glass , huge inch and a half white head that slowly dissipates, with foamy lacing that grows thin. The body is a musty red orange, lightens up at the bottom of the glass. Smells of hops right up front particularly flowers, pine, citrus, grass, a little sharp and tense. Subtle hints of caramel malt, biscuits are back there too. Taste is a bit easier going, a refreshing bitterness is present backed by a malt backbone, not very much sweetness though. Some nice caramel notes emerge toward the middle and a nice pine finish with a tinge of malt sweetness. Personally my only real complaint is the alcohol becomes a little too apparent as this warms up, but still this is a good interpretation of an imperial IPA, fits every well with in the style, and its very much worth a try."
"Enjoyed this one on Christmas Eve paired with lobster tail, flank steak, and shrimp. Hmm boy, does this one compliment food well. Lots of fruit and citrus balance the large amount of hops used to make this Double IPA. Not as pungent on the tongue and easy to finish the whole bottle. Yes sir, a good one for the style."
"-Oelergud"
"This is an excellent example of DIPA and would pair well with Thai food."
"This double really packed in the flavor- the cloudy gold brew left generous lacing and creamy head. Sweet malty notes were overwhelmed by hard citric hops- perfect combination. The aroma gave way to the soft bready malts, some honey sweet with the same citrusy hop profile and a slight warming alcohol undertone. Very slick and smooth on the mouth and easy to drink considering its pedigree."
"D: Very tasty, goes does easy enough, not-too-filling, excellent representation of style, I liked this beer a lot. The only thing I regret about buying this beer is that I didnt buy it sooner. Looking forward to trying more beers from Avery as this was my first from them."
"*4/19/08: Feb. '07 bottle. For me, a toned down citrus character and a dialed up peppery lemongrass character, both in aroma and taste. Otherwise, it's fairly similar and received a score consistent with the original review."
"D-Not bad for a 22 oz. I dont think I will be buying this stuff again.I think this is more on the lines on a barleywine and thats not really my cup of tea.Now give me a ipa and im in heaven.Not worth the price of 7 bucks."
"Although it's a multi-dimensional alcoholic hop bomb, I had no difficulty finishing the 22 ounce bomber."
"golden orange with a long withstanding white head. excellent lacing. aroma is lots of big american hops. a touch sweet in the aroma as well, but there's also a lingering vegetable/earthy smell. nice grapefruity bitterness with piney/grassy hops. finishes a little caramelly sweet. alcohol is well hidden. light resiny but fairly thick mouthfeel. really easy to drink, though. solid iipa, but the cooked vegetable aroma hinders a bit. not sure if it's just an off sampling, but even though, still a solid beer."
"drinkability: once it warmed it was easy to down. the alcohol was unnoticeable and the brew was so balanced that I could have gone through another glass without needing a break. I'm pretty impressed."
"Very good beer at a reasonable price ($5.99 per bomber)."
"Pours a light orangish amber with a foamy white head. The hoppy aroma hits first, very loud and tangy. Hints of fruit are there, most likely from the hops. The taste is extremely hoppy as suspected, and the flavor is also very loud. A giant flavor yet still has that bitter bite at the end. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops with a high ABV taste. The balance isn't quite there, the power of the hops drives the beer but there isn't much else. A good imperial IPA, worth checking out. I enjoyed this beer, but couldn't drink too many because the strong flavor could get annoying."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a pint glass. Looks exactly like cloudy, fresh brewed iced tea with a good two fingers of dense cream colored head. The first thing to hit my nose is the grapefruit followed by an unexpected large dose of sweet malt. The big malt flavor balances out the taste rather nicely and I'm picking up lots of lemon, grapefruit, and I'm picking up a hint of sweeter citrus, possibly orange. Mouthfeel is medium in body and in carbonation. This is a great DIPA that everyone that enjoys this style should seek out. I only had one bomber, but I would not have turned down a second if it was in the fridge."
"Slainte!"
"Pours a light copper with thick head, which eventually dissipates to a nice lacing because of all those hops (112 IBUs). Aroma seems subdued to me, even after I let my glass warm up a bit--some citrusy hops but not as much as I would have expected. The bittering hops are definitely there, but as another reviewer noted, there's also plenty of malt to balance it out. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thick side, but not too thick, and almost perfectly carbonated. A very good beer."
"Well worth the drive over to Illinois to get this brew unavailable in MO."
"D: This is a nice, straight forward DIPA with very nice flavor. Very sweet but nothing cloying about this one. Great complexity"
"Served chilled in a pint glass. Poured a cloudy amber orange with about one finger of bubbly thick white head that left moderate lacing on my glass. Smelled of HOPS! , citrus fruits , and faint pine notes. Tasted again of hops, sweet grapefruit and orange. Nice smooth mouthfeel with a warm alcohol finish that is smooth as well. Nice bitter dipa that was rather drinkable. Wish i had another bomber of this."
"Good refreshing beer. Very well done, but not extra exciting at the same time. Worth the $6 I bought it for."
"Good DIPA...not sure if its truly worthy of the expensive price tag but I found a bomber for $6, which seemed like a bargain, and I'd say it was worth it."
"EDIT: I had this beer in the beer tasting room at the brewery and took notes. A couple weeks later I found my notes and was ready to post them to BA. Well, my rating #s were exactly the same at the brewery vs the bottle. I'm somewhat suprised. Not in a bad way; just suprosed. It's a really nice beer -- bottle or tap."
"Kind of rough on the drinkability. It's all about silly amounts of hops with no finesse. It wallops your tastebuds and doesn't let up."
"Pours a clear copper, small off white head forms, head goes fast but leaves a circle around the glass, lots of lace and decent retention. Smell is very grapefruity, some pine, caramel, more grapefruit, quite nice. Taste is malty up front, caramel, grapefruit and a little pine in the finish, clean bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, quite smooth, lots of grapefruity goodness. My favourite Avery brew."
"Avery brewery seem to knock it out of the park on this one!"
"Medium-bodied with decent carbonation and sweet tones balancing the bitterness well. Overall a pleasant suprise from Avery."
"Recommended, but not best in the style."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"While the mouthfeel is outstanding, there is just a bit of an alcohol bite & when combined with an ABV approaching 10% it makes for a beer that is a delight for one bottle but probably not much more. Still, I will absolutely be buying this again in the near future."
" A great DIPA here."
"d= you can easily get in to this beer. the smell never stops, every time you take another drink the smell is like the first pour."
"D: Drinks easily and smoothly, provided your palate is accustomed to these types of hop-bombing IPAs."
"Hopefully I'll have a chance to buy this again someday. I'd, without a doubt, buy more if/when I do."
"I was impressed with this beer. Very solid DIPA with a good depth of flavor, not just a hopbomb. Just wish this was a little bit cheaper for a bomber."
"Medium body with moderate dryness after swallowing. The abv is hardly noticeable...which could get some into trouble. ;-)"
"i'm a - drink outta' the bottle guy - so's i can't give too much credit to appearance...the smell is bold with plenty of hoppy goodness to delight the nostrils but not overly so...very smooth to the olfactory and to the taste...some Double IPAs can be coating like a cough syrup but this tastes full-of-body without the heaviness usually associated with a full-tasting body...smooth going in and even smoother going down...i found this to be very drinkable until the last 1/5 of the bottle was left...although, i might have nursed mine for a little too long in all honesty...i'll definitely try this again...it's up there in my book but behind the Hercules, 90 min and Stone offerings..."
"Nice creamy, off-white head, and orange color. A light malt aroma, but a heavy hop, orange, citrus, pine resin aroma. Right on style for a DIPA. The mouthfeel was not as thick as some similar brews. It didn't really coat the tongue. In a blind test I'd be hard pressed to distinguish this from Hercules. The taste is very, very similar, but I think the Hercules has a better hop aroma."
"WOW! This is an awesome DIPA, one of the best I've ever had. Pours a cloudy dark golden color, small head, but some nice lacing/islands thoroughout the drink. Scents of hops aplenty, some citrus, and some slight spices. The taste is very sweet and hoppy, a nice bitter bite finish. Medium body, pretty complex for a DIPA. This DIPA is very drinkable, an awesome brew from Avery, highly recommended."
"This beer pours a strikingly bright, slightly hazy orange color with a decent if unimpressive head. The aroma is strong, and it is all hops -- citrus up front, with grapefruit and orange scents followed by sweet piney resins. The flavor delivers what the aroma promised: a citrus hop paradise. The mouthfeel has nice tangy and sticky resin characteristics. The finish is wonderfully crisp, slightly sweet, and followed by a hop bitterness that is just strong enough to balance the hop flavors without overshadowing the fruity, citrusey, sweet perfume hop character that makes this beer so nice. The alcohol content is practically undetectable due to the great balance and bursting flavors present. I really can't say enough about the Maharaja; I've had it on tap numerous times in the past couple of weeks, and I keep going back for more. Aside from the 3F's Dreadnaught, this is one of my favorite DIPAs, and it's far more economical, too."
"Attractive color in the glass. Smells of floral, pine needle, and slight fruit. The taste starts with a punch in the mouth hop but mellows on the palate with a nice finish of fruit and hops. Out of the bottle is great but on tap is more appealing. Very interested to taste after some extended bottle aging."
"Light caramel color with a white head leaving some lacing; looked good but I've seen better in IIPA's. Smell is awesome, citrus is powerful, full of grapefruit and juicy hops. Taste is full of citrus, grapefruit, and pine. It's like sticky hop juice on the tongue, a little bit of alcohol in the finish, brings down taste just a notch. Low to medium carbonation with a medium body. Really drinkable, I'll be picking up another bottle next time I see it."
"The only big Avery beer I've ever had that didn't taste like someone threw a shot of vodka in the bomber. I suppose when you use this much hops it's to be expected. Good, but not worth the $7."
"I was surpirsed by how close the bottled version is to the draught version. Really good. Go get some today."
"Thanks go out to Heath for trucking me a box of fresh CO beers on a recent east coast visit."
"This is a nice, smooth brew but it just does not deliver the high hop profile that one would expect from a DIPA."
"I guess 102 IBUs is not something to be afraid of. I used to avoid DIPAs. Apparently my palate has begun to devolop. I found this to be quite enjoyable. Higher quanities of hops nicely playing off the two-row and caramel, well done."
"A very tasty treat for a hophead. Flavor is quite robust and not for the uninitiated. I will definitely get this one again."
"The taste hides the alcohol well and the brew feels deceptively drinkable - definitely worth a second try."
"D: I have a half of a bottle left? Normally I am thrilled with this, but dont know if I can put down the rest. This is not a very drinkable beer as it just stings the mouth with the grassiness of the hops and the overpowering sweet flavor of the malt."
"This brew pours a clear bright red-orange color. The head is massive, billowy white, and leaves thorough lacing. The aroma is outstanding: lots of grass, lots of pine, lots of citrus, lots of grapefruit, and lots of strength. The taste is very bitter; it is one of the most bitter beers I have ever consumed. The grapefruit comes out a bit more in the taste than it does in the aroma, while the pine does the same in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice smoothness. Overall, this is a darn good IIPA, and I would drink this agian in a heartbeat. The only beef I have with this brew is the complete lack of a malt backbone which would add a little extra to the taste and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - a tasty complex sipper, very nice."
"Hazy copper in color, with a nice fluffy thick white head. Very good head retention, and a great deal of lace left clinging to the sides of the glass. Big piney and citrusy hop aroma. A huge sweet malt backbone combines with sappy, piney, and citrusy hop flavor. The bitterness not only outweighs the malt, but compliments it as well. Very nice and sticky. Very full body. A very solid and sweet Double IPA. Very good."
"Wonderful beer. It has an amber color with a golden glow. It was delivered with a creamy two-finger head with great substantiation. The aroma is of roasted malt and citrus. The diverse flavor sings with strong, bitter, and dynamic hops, toasted malt, citrus, and caramel. The mouth is complex and pleasing--slightly bitter and sweet on the front palate, finishing nice and toasty. Drinkability through the roof. Good stuff indeed, lads."
"Drinkable IPA, def. feel that 9.9% alcohol content after finshing it"
"A great hop monster from Avery. Pours a beautiful orange, looking like pekoe tea. A sturdy, long-lasting head. It's the smell that's the stunner on this one. Absolutely gorgeous aroma; one the best-smelling beers I've come across. Smells of roses, rainwater, lime zest and spicy, piney hops. On palette, there is a major orange and pineapple thing going on. Finish is cedary/piney then, finally, lemony. Mouthfeel is solid with some prickliness on the tongue. Considering the 9.9% abv, this is surprisingly drinkable. On the other hand, it's still 9.9%, so... Hopheads should definitely seek this one out."
"Thanks go out to Quaffer for the bottle."
"D- Awesome! IPA's aren't my usuall thing as I don't believe more hops make a better beer. Double IPA's scare me more. This, however, has the goods and I whole heartadly recommend this. Can't session because of the high alcohol but you won't need to as one should do you right."
"The color is clear and crisp, very impressive with a slight lacing and a very little head. The smell is very fruity and hoppy. Fruity smells of strawberry, also flowery and vibrant. Taste is great with fruit and hops and the aftertaste has a definite strawberry flavor to it. This is a very drinkable brew with some great characteristics."
"It's clear that this would not hold it's own in a lineup of 2xIPA's, I would probably rate this last. I would, out of curiousity, drink this beer again. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A solid DIPA, I am glad this is finally available in Minnesota."
"D: Drinkable, but more drinkable on tap at TPH or Redbones, which both currently have it. This rating would be through the roof if I rated it on tap. This was a drain pour casualty."
"Not a bad beer, but the flavor lacked depth and the alcohol came on a little strong. Every other aspect of this beer was terrific, though."
"Great Beer..."
"I remember sharing some Avery IPA with Adam at the brewery and it reminds me of this. This beer tends to capture the intense hoppiness that the draft IPA has, but is somewhat muted in the bottle. There is a harshness here that the very best IPAs don't have, but it may be because this is an IIPA and the alcohol and hops are on another level. This is a very good beer, but for the money, I'll stick to a 6'er of Founder's Centennial which is much more drinkable. Still definitely recommended. Thank heaven for Avery's envelope pushing."
"Full-bodied and plenty of alcohol and a puckery mouthfeel you won't forget, hopheads don't want to miss this one. Good stuff? Yeah it is!!!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Maudite tulip glass. Body is a beautiful, glowing amber hue topped by a tall, full-bodied tan head that subsides after about 1 minute. Aroma is first and foremost heavy on the alcohol. Sweet, fruity hops are also prevalent, with notes of apricot accenting the sweetness. Palate is a nice blend of lightly sweet malt, huge fruity hops, and fruity notes. The warming alcohol comes through on the finish, but is fairly well concealed for such a strong brew. Body is a touch thick, but manages to not be too syrupy. Very drinkable, especially given the alcohol content. Overall, an absolute pleasure to drink."
"I have no idea how it stacks up against other ipas, but now I've ready to go find out!"
"edit: not hot. dunno what the hell i was talking about"
"D- on a hot day like this (96, heat index of 104) it went down incredibly smooth for a 9.7% abv brew."
"This is certainly a nice beer, but my main complaint is that the alcohol actually seemed to dominate the taste at times. At this point I generally expect the hops in an IPA to kick the ass of everything else, but in this case the alcohol took control. I couldn't quite bring myself to dock the taste rating but I had to take it out of drinkability. Still, I wouldn't turn this one down for a second, unless I had to choose between the Maharaja and a Stone... Otherwise, looked nice, smelled nice, was nice."
"Picked this one up in Porter Square. Pours a nice dark orange, with a nice heading that soon became a white lacing. Smell is excellent, with loads of juicy fruit, sweet sugar, some mild hop presence in background, a mild honey aroma as well. Taste was very sweet, with lots of alcohol up front, and a somewhat sour finish. It was very barleywine like, with all of the alcohol flavors and dark fruit. Mouthfeel was medium bodied....not half bad, seemed to get thicker as it warmed up a little bit. A nice sipping beer, but I would have like a bit more hop bitterness. The sweetness factor just seemed to overwhelm the beer in general. Still worth a try though. Enjoy"
"Drinkability: A great experience and I definitely want to get more bottles of this. Delicious, complex, and highly balanced. One of my favorite Avery brews and one of the best big beers they produce."
"Big hoppy flavor with good balancing of maltiness, sorta sweet. Man i gotta order this stuff. As will all cask conditioned, nice mild carbonation. It appears that San Diego might be heading up the cask- conditioned part of this world."
"Pours a nice dark honey color, just shy of crystal clear (adding a bit of depth). Just a finger of orange beige head, not much lacing (though it is unusually humid today), head dying to a light sheet. Smell is big on honey and caramelized pineapples and general citrus, with some pine hints and a bit of an alcohol kick on the back of the nose. Taste is fairly standard for the Double IPA, lots of hops on the front end, hints of malt and burnt pine. The hop's bitter was a bit sour on the back of the tongue, and the alcohol vapor seems to seep down the throat. Mouthfeel is ever so slightly dry and bitter"
"Music: Piper at the Gates of Dawn, (The) Pink Floyd"
"Big juicy grapefruit flavor upfront overwhelming in its freshness, coupled with a smooth mouthfeel tinged by a touch of rough carbonation. Finish is long and bitter with the heady almost 10% ABV making an appearance.	This is a fantastic beer, perhaps the best DIPA I've ever had. I knocked a few points off for the strong alcohol showing in the finish, but otherwise this is superbly balanced between mouth blistering hops and sweet malts."
"D- This beer has a good fresh complex hoppy profile with depth and a malt flavor that can stand up to the hops without being too sweet or alcohol tasting."
"I found this one exceedingly boring and difficult to finish. A typical over-the-top over-hopped American IPA IMHO."
"Well done Avery again. Once more, totally out of the blue, relocation to Colorado suddenly springs to mind when drinking one of your beers."
"Poured in tulip glass from 22oz bottle. Thick soapy off white head...nice lacing. Pours a golden amber hue, little carbonation. Strong grapefruit, citrus, pine, on the nose. Taste is suprisingly sweet and tangy, palate further illustrates citrus and pine profile. Smooth and full bodied, drinkable but cautiously so at just under 10%. Thoroughly enjoyed overall and would buy again."
"Finishes with a nice dry hoppiness...."
"a good ipa, definitely worth, buying again, i enjoyed it very much."
"I haven't had a lot of this since it's somewhat rare in the Twin Cities, but it is really an excellent DIPA. If it was in 12oz bottles and more available this would be in my top five. Highly recommended!"
"Deep amber-red or auburn color with a nice, big, fluffy head and great lacing and head retention. Beautiful. Aroma is fruity and sweet with hops and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is sweet, bready with noticeable alcohol, some piney hops and bitterness in the finish. I would have liked more hops, but there were enough to balance all the malt. Medium body and a clean finish. A bit sticky feeling, though. Overall, a good beer but not as hoppy as I think an IIPA should be and the alcohol was too noticeable in the taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Heavy and extremely smooth going in... almost syrupy in its texture. I would have liked some more effervescence, but this isn't bad. This 22 oz. bomber is like an anvil, dead weight and bad ass. The sucker punch to the stomach is delivered almost at the end of my tasting, and one of these is certainly enough. Big, bold, and loud as hell."
"Another in the continuning and continually expansive line of high quality, highly satifsying American DIPAs. Bravo Avery."
"Not at all a bad beer here. Very close to the best in the DIPA class but not quite. Easy to drink and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Lighter in body would make this a dangerous brew to slam down, but I'm glad it's not. Good beer to enjoy over a long period of time."
"Had a 22oz. bomber. Poured a dark gold/copper color with very little head. Aroma was all hops. Taste was mainly citrus & hops, but the malt came through as well and I thought this was sweeter than other IPAs I have tried. The mouthfeel was smooth, but the beer came across as """heavier""" than I would expect from an IPA. Drinkability is a hard one to call, it was smooth, but heavy. Alcohol was not noticeable at all. Pretty easy to drink one, but not a session beer."
"This double ipa pours a deep copper color, with bright orange highlights. Very hazy. One finger thick, off white head, fades quickly. Leaves a good amount of sticky lacing. This is the first double ipa where the malt smell is greater than the hop smell. Tons of big malts smells, almost roasted malt. The usual floral and citrusy smells are taking a back seat to the malts. Quite a strong peppery smell also. Taste mimics the smell, tons of big malt flavor upfront and finishes with very little hop bitterness. Some citrusy flavors are there. Full bodied brew, kinda heavy, with a slight oily texture. Overall, not my favorite imperial ipa, but this is an old bottle, so I will have to try this again sometime."
"This beer blew me away. It is one of the best IPA's I have ever had, double or not. It is expensive but if you like this beer style you need to try it at least once."
"This beer is a flavor event. A killer DIPA that put me on my ASS."
"Final thoughts: Avery continues to put out great brews and then price them into the stratosphere. I'm really glad I sampled this IIPA, it rocks! But at this price, ($7.45 for a 22 oz bomber), I am not sure when, if ever, I will buy it again."
"My only complaint is the price, I can only find a bomber for around $6 yikes!"
"This beer would probably not make a great session beer. It is high in alcohol, so too many would be a bad idea. Also, the flavor is pretty aggressive, so it might be overbearing after a few. This is a great beer, and I look forward to getting more of it."
"Notes: I thought it was decent. This would be considered extreme just a few years ago but now its mild and on the sweeter end of a DIPA."
"It's a bit disappointing. Overall, I'd say this is one of the lesser DIPAs I've had. While it's not bad by any stretch; there are better beers of its style out there."
"Mouthfeel is phenolic and spicy. I only had one 22-oz bottle, but I would have cracked another if I had it."
"I'll steer clear of any cheesy Taj Mahal references and just say it's big and full and well balanced. Quite sweet to start, the hoppy backbone keeps things in check. It's a flavorful combo of elements that does nothing to disappoint. The ABV is substantial, quite apparent, warming, and limiting as well, if you're still thinking clearly after one. Because of its bigness, it's enjoyable in a big way. I will do this again, just on another day."
"Definitely worth a try if it's available in your area. Was struck by how similiar to Stone's Arrogant Bastard it left me. Again a World Class DIPA."
"music: thievery corporation-cosmic game- track 4 -Satyam Shivam Sundaram"
"(paired incredibly well with a creamy blue cheese)"
"I'm curious to see where the flavor goes after some cellar time."
"Drinkabilty - goes down fairly easy. This is a very good beer, but high abv limits it to one 22 oz. bomber ( 2 x 12 oz. equivalent ) per session ( maybe two 22 oz 'ers, if you're not driving, or do not have to get up early )."
"Overall I thought this beer was a good change up and a nice treat. It did make the following IPAs seem not so hoppy, so save this one for the end of your tastings."
"Overall a good double ipa, but not my favorite. A fine beer, but when i'm in the mood for a beer of it's style, i'll be seeking out others."
"Pours into the glass an intense and slightly cloudy amber color with an excellent tan head that retains impressively and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is massive, with a huge citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon) hops character as well as resinous piney hops, caramel, fruity esters, toasted bread and alcohol. The flavor also starts off with giant citrus hops (grapefruity, lemon and orange), as well as some piney and resinous hops, caramel and honey malt sweetness, fruity esters, toasted bread and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy, and drinkability is descent. A very nice IIPA, a bit thick but very tasty and packed with flavor."
"An interesting beer to try. I'd be fascinated to try this against other double IPAs. Could be summed up: Love your hops, love this beer."
""""Bottled in Feb. 2006, Batch 3""" 9.9% ABV. Damn! Avery beers are available in Buffalo now! Picked this up today at Consumer's on Eggert. Pours golden amber with fast-rising carbonation and a moderate off-white head. Thick webs of lacing all around the glass. Nose of sprucey-cannabis and sweet blood orange sections -- 102 IBUs, and nostril-stinging is in full effect. Wow, taste is much sweeter and far less bitter than expected: corn syrup-enhanced orange-grapefruit juice and sugary caramel maltiness almost all the way through yields to a distinctly cannabinoid pine-flavored finish. Mouthfeel is astringent and juicy but becomes thicker, more syrupy as the beer warms. Ridiculously delicious piney hop burps. Actually, I'd say that the aftertaste is the best aspect of this generally good DIPA. I think it's more drinkable when well-chilled. Welcome to WNY, Avery!"
"Ah yes! The label on mine says, """Bottled in Feb. of 2006. Batch No.3""" 9.9% alc/vol (versus the 9.7 as stated here)."
"Overall verdict: this is a very good beer, but the alcohol content mixed with the bottle size will keep me from getting this brew again."
"Overall, this is a pretty drinkable IIPA. I really like the hop blend they've used (not sure what it is) and the overall balance. Definitely give this a try."
"Drinkability: a true slow sipper, and an over the top version of a double IPA. There are better ones out there that aren't so in your face."
"Nice offering from Avery, definitely meets the criteria for a west coast American double IPA. Overall, a very pleasant, enjoyable offering that is sure to please most any hop head out there. While at times the alcohol is visible, this brew is very easy to drink and it will creep up on you. Drink with caution. Maharaja is welcome at my place anytime."
"Nice hoppy, grassy taste. A little too syrupy, but terrific smell and leaves lacing down the glass. Can be tough to drink too many, as alcohol is prevalent and high. However, if you love IPA's, this is an awesome offering. Just hard to make a session brew, but that's just cause of the style. And nice hoppy grapefruit, kick the backend."
"M/D- This beer was really surprising and one of the best that I have ever had. The alcohol was disguised very well for being so high(9.7-9.9abv), and although the hops were very big in the finish the beer felt very well balanced between the carmel malts, the fruity flavors, and the hops. I think what did it for me was the smell of the apricot/peach every time you lifted the glass up to your mouth, it really just hit me, and to be followed by such flavor was just wonderful. This was really drinkable for the high alcohol level, so be careful it creeps up on you. I enjoyed it so much I picked up a bottle and brought it back with me on the plane. I'll find out soon if it is as good out of the bottle as it is on tap."
"Quite a nice beer overall, as are most of Avery's offerings."
"Medium body....low carbonation. Very drinkable, but probably not sessionable due to the high ABV. Warming effect is there, but it's not in your face...kind of slowly works it's way in."
"Drinkablility? Sorry...I'm not even going to finish this one."
"Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer, I can't wait to try a fresh one when it hits the store this summer."
"Bottom line: This is a hop *monster*...look yee not for any malt balance because it just isn't there. I recommend it for occasional useage."
"Dexcellent. A hop bomb for sure, but definitely drinkable. The almost 10% ABV prevents it from being a session beer, but another bottle of this would be welcomed."
"The amazing part of this beer (and the reason for its highest praise, in my mind) is that this high ABV DIPA only has the slightest alcohol burn at the back of the mouth, and it is highly drinkable. I almost didn't open this tonight because of the alcohol content, but it is highly drinkable for the style. There are some that do it better for me in the flavor profile, but I can easily drink this one and enjoy it."
"A wonderful, rich copper colored beer, with a sturdy head, a poignant punch of hop greatness in the nose is followed by one of the silkiest IPAs in existence. Great depth in the adjuncts used. I'm not sure exactly the species brewed with here, but whatever melody the brewmaster conjured, it's a damn fine one. Almost too easy to drink for an imperial, the 9.9% ABV is almost a shadow. Which to my tastes, is a good thing. I would have to say it's worth the six bucks. i would recommend all of the hop lovers out there to keep one or two of these in the far corner of the 'fridge just for rainy days. Great beer. Period."
"I had never had an Imperial IPA before I had this one, and I still havn't had another, which is my bad. I thought this beer was absolutly outstanding. It's easy to tell the deeper malt flavor that makes this an Imperial, but as I write this I can't even really remember that malt taste because the hop flavor was so overwhelmingly delicious. I pin pointed the use of simcoe hops right away, which is one of my favorites, because of the citrus-y, almost grape fruit flavor. If you like IPA, you will like this beer."
"this beer came in a 22oz bottle. it pored out a nice color with about a 2 in head. it smelled like citris. when i drank it it went down very well. i can tell its a imperila ipa but not as hard as some others i have had. i would defently have another of these. as it is a seasonal and hard to get around me i probaly will get another 2 or 3 bottles in the next couple of days to drink again"
"What a pleasure to find a double IPA of this caliber in a bottle. Bought a bottle (22 oz) of this last night at the Concordia Alehouse (Portland, Or), and given the abv., thought I better share it with the bartender and a neighbor. However, it was so damn tasty I almost wish I'd kept it all to myself. This beer has a fabulous hop presense in the nose and is unabashedly bitter/hoppy on the palate. The flavor just explodes on the palate. This beer reeks of citrus and pine, but is oh so well balanced. Everything is in beautiful proportion, with just enough malt to keep this beer from geting tiring (a problem I sometimes have with the Hercules from Great Divide). Maybe it's not quite in the same league as the twin titans from Russian River (Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger), but it's pretty darn close. An absolutely excellent double IPA, and one I'll be taking home whenever I need a hops fix and don't feel like bellying up to the bar at my neighborhood pub."
"A smooth and delicious beer that sips like a fine wine. As the beer warms the flavours punctuate and let you know about the 9.7%. A dam good IMP ipa and will store a couple of these for later!"
"This is a very good douple IPA from Avery. It pours an dark orangey color with a moderate head. It smells of piney and citrus hops with a slight, but not overbearing, alcohol presence. The taste is all hops, without being too much of a kick in the mouth, due to the nearly-hidden malt backbone. It has a wonderfully creamy mouthfeel that makes each sip a pleasure. Overall a terrific offering from Avery. This is suitable for both special occasions and regular drinking."
"I really like this. Its probably the most intense DIPA Ive tried so far. Not as herbaceous and deep as Ruination but extremely drinkable."
"On tap at the Spuyten Duyvil. The beer poured a hazy amber color into the glass with a nice tan head and good lacing down the sides. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of floral hops and a bit of orange. Very pleasing. The taste is even more enjoyable with a nice hops bit and some malty sweetness all surrounded by nice carbonation in the body. What a treat. Although the abv is rather high in this beer, it is masked well with the tastes going on inside but leads to a rather full body."
"The taste was equisite. Rounded tangerine and citrussy orange pulp up front ending on a bitter note. Flavors of pulpy orange juice and mandarin oranges are what constantly come to mind. Smooth, medium bodied and nicely carbonated this hop gift from god comes over as. This is a beer not to miss if you love the hops and is my favorite from avery."
"Hop heads take heed!"
"Pours a rusty, clear color with some big bubbles and a little bit of lacing. Smell is hooooppy. Earthy, grassy hops, to be more specific. Damn that'll wake you up in the morning. Taste is also hoppy in a grassy, earthy way. Some breadyness makes its way through as well. Just.... soooo hoppy. Mouthfeel is alright, and it's pretty drinkable. Man. Hoppy. Good. Try."
"My friends and I have long been fans of Avery's The Reverend and Salvation, so when I saw this one at Cellar's I had to get it. Overall a very solid brew, but not my favorite IIPA."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full. A bit of oiliness, but not too slick going down. Good feel though, but like I mentioned above, the bitterness lingers and the flavor goes away. Drinkability is nice. Nicely hopped and well balanced, really quaffable for this level of ABV. Definately a must pickup if you see it..."
"It's very easy drinking for the 9.9% ABV. I was a bit shocked to see it running that high. I've found Avery to be a decent brewery, but there wasn't any beer I'd go out of my way to get. Until now..."
"Wow, what a beer!!! The Maharaja is something else: it rules. Take the cap of the growler and the smell takes over your senses (no hint of alcohol here just pure pleasure). It is the most absolutely wonderful aroma of any beer-period! An herbal delight for the olfactory system. Pours from the growler with a nice amber color and a nice foamy head. Yum, the taste is hoppy but not excessively bitter. A pleasantly well balanced flavor profile. There is a mild sticky factor on the tongue, which is forgivable and does not diminsih this taste treat. This is a dangerous beer, given the ABV, with no hint of the high alcohol content. Search this out and enjoy. Beware all other DIPAs will no longer suffice."
"Well what can I say. I've always been a big Avery fan and the Maharaja does not dissapoint. Not to say it's the best IPA I've tried but nonetheless it is extremely balanced, and easy to drink. This beer has great flavors that are pretty much what's in the nose. The only thing that seems lackluster about this brew is that for an IPA it could be a little hoppier. But I do think the IBU's in this brew make it what it is and that's one of the easiest, smoothest drinking IPA's I've tried to date."
"D - very high, a great IPA, one of the best ive ever had"
"A very nice surprise...very enjoyable...I do recommend."
"BANG! Nose of medicinal hops. Dole pineapple juice christmastreeoverload . . . wow! Pours copper-gold with an off-white head of moderate duration and notable lacing. JUICEY hops, creamy texture and lively on the palate. Medium bodied, oily-resiny texture, dry and astringent. Berry notes in its aromatics, reminds me of (gulp) the white/pineapple-flavored jelly beans at Eastertime (in a good way of course.) Mostly dry, but semi-sweet, with bitterness running the full length of the spectrum (beginning, middle, and end-of-palate.) The big alcohol is extremely well-hidden, with a hop profile that is on-par with Avery's other alpha-rich brews, and that's exactly what I'd expect of a double IPA from Avery. Herbal, vegetal hops . . . it's like walking into a greenhouse at the end of winter! This is an easy step-up from their very-palatable year-round I.P.A., and poured next to Hog Heaven (for comparison's sake), Maharaja's intense hop profile is pervasive, intruding on the (by comparison) delicate profile of Hog Heaven (and btw, Maha followed by H.H. is a deadly 1-2 punch!) Maharaja is everything I'd expect of the style from a consistent, top-notch brewery like Avery. Batch 3 (2/06 bottling 3/27 decanting.)"
"This is a beer designed to for sipping and contemplation--a heady mix of traditional IPA flavors with a strength and bite that puts it in a class all by itself. This is a must-have beer. Kudos to Avery."
"DK: One of my favorite DIPAs. Extremely rich, yet quite drinkable as well. This one could be dangerous."
"All in all... typical Avery.... in-your-face brewing... delicious hop belches follow the finish of the bottle... certainly a must-try if you're a hop head."
"Copper hued liquid sitting below a clan a microscopic bubbles desperately clinging together, first growing large, then dying into a smooth film that barely coats the surface of the liquid. The aroma first reminds of opening two ounces of fresh whole flower Centennial buds, a very dry, spicy, medicinal, resinous, but most of all, extremely woodsy hop aroma. I didnt detect much of a aromatic malt contribution, perhaps a bit of caramel, biscuit and fruit, but I did detect a somewhat unpleasant vitamin scent, which I attribute to yeast, although I could be wrong. The flavor does indeed exude much more malt flavor than any of Averys previous double IPAs, especially Eleven, providing a huge base of caramel and toffee which serves to balance the onslaught of hop flavors that I simultaneously experience. The general flavor is a resinous blend of several hop varieties, which is well balanced by all the other elements of the beer. A tasty one for sure, and a unique way of approaching the style."
"I've been looking forward to sampling this beer ever since NC lifted the cap and I eagerly snatched up several bottles as soon as they appeared on the shelves. This brew poured a beautiful bright orange amber hue into my glass with a half inch head that left sticky lacing along the sides. Aroma was an incredible fusion of pungent, grassy hops, grapefruit and apricots in the nose. Taste was a hop lovers wet dream, very hoppy, fruity and with notes of peaches, apricots and grapefruit on the tongue. This beer had a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and was easy drinking for it's strength. The 9.9% abv stated on the label is not noticeable. I polished off two 22oz bottles in just a couple of hours. This is by far one of the tastiest beers that I have ever had and gives any other DIPA a run for it's money."
"overall, a fabulously delicious doble IPA, pretty standard for the style (compared to other good ones). right up there with Great Divide's Hercules."
"This brew is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Rather creamy in its mouthfeel considering the hop ratio. Sweet fruit and malts work symbiotically with the rather citric hops to create a balance that nods in the hop direction, but remains quite palatable. Interesting complexity that brings new flavors in successive drinks. Very intense flavors. A well crafted brew that doesn't have any reservations and doesn't compromise."
"All in all, a more elegant, much more drinkable Maharaja this year. Kudos to Adam and the boys down on Arapahoe Ave."
"Poured a slightly cloudy orange colro with a moderate level of carbonation and intense lacing. A thick and wavey head that stayed put. Aromas of hops, alcohol, and yeast. The taste was quite hoppy with minimal malt presence. Biting bitterness that develops its potency over time. Refreshing texture and mouthfeel with a mellow finish. Good drinkability and good example of the style, but not the best out there. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Taste wise is very hoppy, aromatizing floral hops come out very strongly followed by a malted hint."
"The body had a slightly higher mid range. The ABV was noticeable but still easy to drink and really was a background taste. Well balanced and a sweet taste for a DIPA."
"D - Not bad at all for someone who likes extreme type beers, however the lack of balance and tiny bit """too far""" on the sweetness does make the drinkability fall off a little bit."
"A very good Double I, but from the Avery 10 and 11, this is a slight step down. The hops are outragously flavorful and bitter. The aromas are a boquet of floral and earthy hops with a strong underlying malt presence. Big on the malts without becoming sweet. The hops IBU's keep this barley heavy beer dry and balanced. The feel is just short of thick. Greatly drinkable if not for the heavy and complex flavors. Spicy and dry in the aftertaste. The downside is that the northwestern hop character and malt fermentation leaves the beer a bit metalic and salty, thus slight of high drinkability. The 10% shows good heat and presence without becoming harsh or overwhelming. I'll be trying a few more in the future."
"Beer pours into my Duvel tulip glass a deep coppery amber color, with a healthy white, fluffy head that persists well. Aroma is of tart cirtus and grass, thoroughly mouthwatering. Resiny hops do dominate the flavor, but there's a lot of malty sweetness to back it up. This could almost pass for a Barleywine, as the 112 IBUs never overwhelm. Well, maybe not a Barleywine, but there IS balance in this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little slick, could be better there. The drinkability is ok for a DIPA, or any 9.7% ABV beer for that matter, but the alcohol is noticable as the brew warms, so that is an area that could be slightly improved as well. Still one of my more favorite DIPAs and definitely a beer I like to keep one of around."
"Drinkability- This one is quite nice. Maybe breaks into my top 10 favorite DIPA's. Very drinkable and the abv seems a bit higher than it feels. Recommended."
"The mouth feel is very thick with a light carbonation, but the clean finish makes this very enjoyable."
"A new favorite and one I hope to find again soon."
"Somewhat hazy, slightly orange tinged amber color. Nice head atop a 22 ounce glass. Great hop aroma. I could smell it wafting up from the glass as I poured. Extremely fresh and pungent hop aroma-I almost get a visual of the hop oils. Great balance of hop and malt flavor. Floral taste-again the hops are so clearly defined its almost scary. Finishes slightly sweet with a hint of bitterness. Nice, slick mouthfeel. Very evenly balanced throughout. Very, very drinkable beer. Well worth trying and consuming on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: This beer is very smooth in spite of its size 9.7% alcohol by volume. Very tasty and very nice buttery mouth feel."
"Pours an apricot hue oooh, and smells like fruit and other good sweet citrusy stuff. Head is thin but exists right where it should be, on top of the godly liquid. Well, as it goes down the sweetness hits you up front with the hops following and some slight citrus flavors towards the end. You really don't drink this beer, you chew through it. And for as thick as it feels, the beer is pretty light so to speak. I was able to down the bottle and not feel bloated. I could have had another and another and... The alcohol content is fairly high too, a good thing if you just want to relax and have one brew. Great brew to sit back and drink while watching a movie. Drink her slow and enjoy."
"Medium bodied, and moderat carbonation, this would be a very interesting beer in cask, or even through a randall. Very nice."
"A pretty good offering, as mentioned the difficulty in reviewing this style hurt this beers review. At $6.00 a bottle, I'll be trying others before revisiting this one."
"Pours a clear amber with about a finger of frothy white head. Some nice lacing as I drink it. The malt is the first thing I smell, but is soon joined by citrusy and grassy hop notes. The taste is full of citrusy hops and caramel. The malt stands up to the hops making this very drinkable. This is a full bodied drink that is great to sit and relax with."
"Amber in colour with medium-high carbonation. Huge grapefruit and pine hop nose, along with a good strong caramel malt note. While I had been expecting a thick and syrupy brew, there was actually a dimention of lightness to the palate which was quite refreshing. The up-front flavors are dominated by sweet caramel malts, which evolve into a more grainy note before the assault of orange and grassy (almost minty) hops. Not the most complex example of an IIPA out there, but definitely one of the more easy drinking ones."
"This one is what I expect out of a Double IPA. Very similar to Avery 10 and 11 in taste and character, but this has a better balance and more pronounced flavor and aroma profile. This is the best product I've sampled from the folks at Avery. This is the kind of beer that the BA website has led me to fall in love with. Nirvana in a bottle, this one. Supremely drinkable! This is one that I would take to a deserted island. Very highly recommended."
"The color is a bright, mid-range shade of copper with a high level of carbonation. The off-white head is thick and has great retention. The aroma begins with a strong whiff of oily hops, but soon a strong, rich, and somewhat fruity malt smell takes over. The flavor has an interesting combination of hop and malt flavors; and is a little bit different from the few other 2XIPAs I've had. The malt flavor is strong, almost like a weak barleywine, with a distinct fruitiness. The hop flavor is strong, resinous, but not quite distinctly piney or citrissy. More than just a touch of alcohol flavor is noted towards the finish. This is great stuff, different from what I was expecting, but always interesting."
"A big beer, one I will seek out again, if not again and again. A treat and a nice change from latest infatuation with dark, rich, alcoholic stouts (weather is getting colder). Good stuff again from Avery, who has yet to dissappoint me. Try some."
"22 ounce bottle. Purchased at Vintage Cellar in Radford, VA."
"Consumed this bomber with ease. My wife has been circling me like a vulture and stealing gulps at every chance, so it's a true winner in this house."
"D -I particulary like this beer simply because its a basic well flavored Double IPA,"
"Maharaja Imperial India Pale Ale is the antithesis of a well-mannered DIPA. It's big, bold and bombastic. Avery has a penchant for brewing Big Beer, but they tend to forget that refinement is a necessary quality in even the biggest beer. The relatively high scores that I've granted are a testament to my love of all things hoppy. I'm guessing that those of you who don't belong to 'Hopheads For Life' won't feel so generous."
"Overall impression:"
"Props go out to Adam Avery for delivering to us a little slice of heavenly nectar."
"Beat up the brat, beat up the brat, beat up the brat with a baseball bat..."
"For hop lovers you've got to put this beer on your list."
"This is a wonderful DIPA, full of hops in every way. Gotta be one of the best. Big malt, big hops, big alcohol, everything you could ask for in a DIPA. Highly recommended."
"Pretty let down by the aroma. Mostly sweet malt and alcohol. The beer looks great. Deep red and oranges with a sticky off white head. After a couple of drinks my mustache is very sticky. Very sweet with a lot of burn. And it doesnt hang around long enough. Dont get me wrong. Id never turn down the Maharaja, but there are a few that Id pick before."
"Opinion: This is a really assertive beer, and it wears the IIPA label well. There is so much hops in this beer that it distracts you from the hefty alcohol producing malt. It somehow ends up almost balanced...but after the fact your head is spinning, and your palate wondering when it got hit by a truck. Nice beer!"
"call me a slur monster after finishing this monster. utterly drinkable, the hops make me salivate with expectation between sips, but drink to much and Mr Abv slaps you upside the head (Mr ABV dont play that). This is VERY worth getting. not a session beer unless you want to session yourself into a coma..."
"This is a very good and very different view of a DIPA. I am not overwhelmed by any aspect of this beer but I am not underwhelmed either. That impresses me; I mean this beer is from Avery. There is power but there is grace. There is thunder but there is a light mist. It is making me hungry; I want earthy cheese. I want tangy fruit. I want another bomber, maybe because I split my bottle with Tara. Damn that hophead fiend! I thought the range of DIPAs was limited, well, it is still is but this beer does increase my perspective. Oh, if you havent gathered this beer is very drinkable. I purchased it in Boulder, CO. Recommended."
"Good medium copper apearance, a stiff but overall short head of about 1/4 of an inch. Nice laces, spread evenly about the glass. Aroma has a good hop oil scent, a bit on the lemon side, not so pithy or juicy. Good mouthfeel, heavy but with OK carbonation. Flavor is well-balanced and that's a good thing, I say. A brown sugar thickness, some molasses but a big hop counterpoint that does the beer in good standing. There is no way I could mark this beer down, now that I am drinking a bottle by myself (it was fun pouring it with Adam Avery at the last BA fest)...the """Raja""" has a balance I don't get in many Double IPAs...maybe its still the memory of Russian River face-to-face with this that makes it good but not world-class in what that style CAN be..."
"I really liked this beer. It's a great DIPA, and it's very balanced compared to many that I've tried."
"Poured a nice deep orange with good head retention and nice lacing. Nose is bready and sweet. Taste is more malty than hoppy. Starts off with a sweet blast of malts finishing with a nice subtle hop which is not what I expected. It is more like a supercharged ESB. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and very full. Overall drinkability is good. The high ABV is pretty well masked. This is a very well crafted brew!"
"Nice job, Avery!"
"Toasted caramel throws the first punch. Pine afterburners kick in and dry out the flavourscape for a nice finish that is actually not overly dry. There is perhaps too much malt presence here. More than I had expected. There is just something sickening about the flavour. A dirty, gritty sweetness hangs on like a pit bull. Nearly impeccable body for the style though. I was expecting an overly hoppy and novel taste when in fact, The Maharaja is laying down a huge cloying maltiness in his flavour kingdom. I am going to need my turban rewrapped after this splash. Overall, a bit nauseating."
"At almost 10% I was worried this one would be a little hot given my experience with some of Averys stronger beers. This was a deep orange color body with reddish highlights topped with a light tan small head. Light webbings of lace were left around the glass. Sweet hop juicy citric aroma with plenty of malt to be had. This could use a bit more hops and bitterness. The flavor retains the citric juice hops that were gong on in the nose but with more bitterness to help it along. Nice maltiness here with a light sweetness than the nose. Finishes with a nice hop juiciness and a light bitter bite. Pretty big mouthfeel here but none of the prickly hop feel on your tongue I expect form Double IPAs. Good drinkability as well, the taste is hoppy yet balanced. Good overall effort but a boost in the nose and bitterness would do this one a world of good. Also the alcohol was no where to be found."
"No doubt about it, this beer is a little hot. Alcohol up front that quickly smooths into a sweet tangerine flavor that even more quickly slips into hoppy flavors that become much spicier. Eventually the hops build to an tooth enamel ripping level. They are everywhere and dominate the body of this beer. After the first couple of sips that is about all you taste. Long lingering bitterness, numbing the toungue. Haven't had an experience quite like this since I first tried Ruination. All in all though it's tasty and I would have it again. It's quite unbalanced and that doesn't work well with this beer. Probably the only thing keeping it from being truly great would be a weak (relatively speaking) malt profile."
"Nice to try another big bad double IPA,pours a slightly hazy deep orange with a tight one finger head that leaves a sheet of lace behind on the way down,well what would you expect from a double IPA aroma wise HOPS and more hops in the aroma pine and definent grapefruit coming thru srong not much malt profile but it wasnt expected.This beer coats the tongue somewhat thick in the mouthfeel dept the alcohol flavor doesnt overpower though by any means,big resiny and citrusy can make the tongue curl.Not quite as good in my opinion as its Colorado cousin Great Divid Hercules double IPA but this is no chump damn fine beer."
"Overall: This is a very good brew. I felt it was a bit light in the flavor department for a DIPA or else it would have been great."
"Too young! Too hoppy! And that's from a hophead. The balance is not there and the malt is too weak. A sticky hop oil mouthfeel leaves too much of an after taste. Not a good offering from Avery; who makes some pretty good products. Not sure of the hop variety, but too much was used!"
"and enjoyable glad I bought an extra for myself wishing I had bought a few more."
"Thick body and mild carbonation. Silky smooth on the tongue and gentle going down. No CO2 acrid here or stingy bubbles forming on the tongue. Really smooth, thick, and creamy. Lacing on the glass is about as good as it gets. Pull it over me like a blanket...I'm lit and ready for bed."
"A good one to try if you haven't had it, but a bit pricey (I paid $5.99). Could have been hoppier, especially on the tongue. Tasty as hell in any case. Drank this one at around 55 degrees."
"Comments - What a great beer this is! One of Avery's top offerings, in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied..slightly slick with good carbonation. This one left me longing for something more...I'll have to pass next time and hope they re-use the recipe for Eleven one of these days!"
"perfectly balanced for an experimental hop devil. solid body and mouthfeel without thickening it up too much. a near-perfect double IPA in my mind."
"823"
" My first sip is normal. Normal, for the Maharaja, that is. The sweet hops battle with the malt at first, eventually sweeping it aside completely. The hops contribute grapefruity, piney flavors that are coating of one's mouth, yet the sweetness is not cloying. This beer has fantastic head retention for the ABV. Mouthfeel is right on for the style. I have yet to find a IIPA that isn't just a little bit syrupy. The moderate to low carbonation found in this brew give it a creamy mouthfeel that begs for sipping which borders on gulping. As with most other IIPAs, I find this beer to be extremely drinkable. I am almost finished with the bomber and have yet to get the usual hop hiccups, knock on wood."
"i love the doubles, and this is a good one. a session beer? i mean, it's an i2pa...so session has to be relative. can a drink more than a glass or two? definitely."
"Maharaja is in keeping with Averys not hiding anything approach with their beers. In this case, Avery has done a really good job crafting a big, bad, smash-mouth double IPA. No one aspect is insanely over the top (re: Beasts alc. content); rather they all work well to produce a dangerously drinkable double IPA. Well worth trying out."
"Excellent! Control ones Avery expectations, and just sample the brew. It starts with the eye catching labeling, and progresses to an amber/orange pour with ivory head. PUNGENT floral, grassy, hoppy aroma. Dry (duh) hoppy taste, balanced out well with malts and citrus. Different mouth, very oily and slick, coats the tongue & throat. As it warms, the flavors increase accordingly. Sneaky 9.7% will give ya a poke by the end of the bomber."
"Finish has is dry with a hint of sweetness and hop tang. Long lasting. Very good beer, not excellent, and questionably worth the high entrance price."
"Great looking pour with a dark ruby, amber color. Medium sized white head, lots of lacing. Aroma explodes of hoppy piney citrus upon opening the bottle. Very aromatic and resinous right away. Kind of sweet too. Taste gives me a bit more syruppy sweetness than I would like but that helps out the biting piney hops which are in full force. The main flavor is citrus fruit which is sweet and tart and bitter all at the same time. The body is light for the alcohol strength and hop bitterness, I'd like it to be a bit fuller. Finish is piney, raw hoppiness. Good beer, almost great but not quite."
"The body is lacking for beer this big, weighing in on the lighter side of medium. Mouthfeel is oily and juicey slick with a looong citrus drenched hop finish."
"edit #2: This is one of my favorite beers now. Huge, malty, hoppy DIPA. very balanced, pleasantly medicinal/herbal/citrus flavors. Nothing wrong with this beer at all, I get a bomber when I can afford to pay $8. Really it's a bargain I'm just poor (Dec. 2011)."
"This beer is a nice clear, dark amber with a quarter inch of off-white head. The smell is filled with the promise of lots of hops, there is also a sweet fruity aroma. The taste is very hoppy but well balanced. At first it tastes a litle too sweet, but that doesn't last long. The hops kick in quickly. Overall it is a little too sweet, or more correctly it could use more hops. There is not much of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very good. It is smooth and juicy with alcohol evident as well. While I would say the drinkability is good for this kind of beer, it is definitely not a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, resiny, can't drink this too fast. No trace of alcohol, just a thick, juicy bitterness keeping it in check. It has a really raw quality that puts me off just a little, maybe just a bit too sweet. Nice, but I prefer my hop-bombs with just a little more lightness. like a Bigfoot."
"Drinkability is relatively high. Little bit over the top but a real solid hop lovers delight."
"A real smooth drink though. Creamy, with the hop oils being barely noticable. An easy sipper, but still not hoppy enough."
"hazy orange almost pumpkin ale colored, with thin tan sticky head. grassy citrusy hops aroma with a good caramel malt base that holds its own against the hops. a candied aroma develops as it warms. big hop bitterness and flavor. citrusy herbal hops, with lots of caramel sweetness. some more subtle juicy fruit flavors underneath, mostly pear. the bitter hop aftertaste is nearly perfect with just the right amount of bitterness. it walks the fine line between excellent and too bitter. verysilky smooth full body with mild carbonation. an excellent imp IPA, i regret not getting this on tap the last time i saw it. a must try if you're a fan of the style."
"part of sampler tray at Kclingers. Amber color with slight white head. Smell is of fruitiness and citrusy undertones.Taste is of hoppiness with a continuation of the citrusy fruitiness. Mouthfeel leaves a slight dryness. Extremely enjoyable beer. I was amazed when I found out it was 9.7%"
"Mentor Encomium."
"enormous thanks to mentor for the bottle!"
"Pours a light amber color with a tall head that falls slowly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus hops with a subtle caramel malt sweetness in the back. The flavor isn't nearly as hoppy as I expected it to be. Very well balanced, nice malt character and bitterness profile, but could use more hop flavor. Drinkability is great for the alcohol level and the body is moderate."
"Sampled tonight, but from notes. It poured a sligtly coppered golden color with a 2 finger head that fell slowly to a finger over the brew. I liked the retention. The nose was very nice, with a good caramel malt base under tinges of oranges, grapefruit hops, land ight bready notes. Overall, fairly good. The flavor was not as nice as the nose. The caramel was big and thick, but the hops didn't hold up. They were there, but not in force. The feel was thick and rich, almost syrupy on my tongue. Overall dinkability was great for the size of this beer. It was refreshing and quaffable. A very nice brew."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a huge cream-colored heads and tons of excellent lacing. Nose is both fruity and floral--pine, grapefruit, oranges, lemon, smells very appealing. Taste is full sweet caramel malts upfront which give way to an explosion of citrisy hops. Very little bitterness in the aftertaste for the amount of hop flavor that is present. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy for this beer. And the 9.7% alcohol is hidden extremely well---I could easily drink several of these in a session. Great beer to go along with a great bottle from Avery."
"Drinkability/notes: Surprisingly good, an excelelnt example of a style that I do not usually find much favor with."
"Heavy bodied, feels like a barley wine. The taste is no less impressive. But it isn't as complex in malt or hops as IPA can be. This one is a sipper. You can sit, relax and enjoy the excellent balance between the sweet toasty malt and the bitter citrusy hops in all their glory with The Maharaja."
"Poured a nice red-tinged brown in color. Slightest of heads that disappeared altogether. No lace. Very little carbonation. Aroma is malts and green hops. Taste is pretty straightforward. Malts at first, followed up with a decent hop balance. The hops linger in the mouth late into the beer. Bit of a piney tang to the beer, not unpleasant though. Mouthfeel is at first flat and then kind of fizzes for a second. Medium body. I found this beer fairly drinjable, but was kind of put off by the mouthfeel."
"Pours a hazy light copper color, with a long-lasting head of fluffy white foam. A fine coating covers the glass as it is drunk. Nose is, naturally, full of hop aroma, noticibly flowery and citrusy. Taste is very sharply bitter, and even though there's obviously a lot of residual sugar, you have to hunt around the forcibly dry bitterness to find it. Hop flavor is very full, ranging from grapefruit citrus to piney to peppermint-like. The finish is dry and lingers around forever. Quite full-bodied, this is a big beer in every sense of the word. Yet, there are a lot of other very big IPA's out there currently, and this one doesn't quite stand out the very crowded field."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Head lasts, and laces delicately yet plentifully. Aroma is juicy fruit hops. Taste starts with a light malt sweetness, and quickly morphs into fruity hops which tantalyze, yet do not overpower. We're talking hops flavor here, not just the bitter hammer over the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, which can sometimes be daunting. An almost subtle yet effective brew, surprised by this one (still fearing The Beast)..."
"The head is small, still, bumpy and thick. The beer is a clear, still, copper-amber. Runny sheets of lacing. Nose is sweet: sugar, grass, pine, citrus. Nice, hoppy. Huge hoppy pine in the front with major pepper and spice. Some roasty nuts. The middle is very thick, sweet and malty. But the hops are never far from sight. Huge alcohol finish (a little rubbing alcohol) and more mountains of hop. Bitter aftertaste with loads of pepper. It's not bad. The alcohol is pretty raw, but the hops are fresh and juicy. And there's enough malt. Quite nutty with temperature. It's a decent drink."
"Drinkability is good, but I would have a hard time putting down more than two of these at a sitting. Especially at the price."
"Well, as advertised. A seriously bitter double IPA. Great appearance (deep amber, large foamy head), and the fruity hop aroma busts out of the bomber. The bitterness leads to a somewhat dry finish, and the malts (although providing a sturdy backbone) are not as prominent as in the Hercules from GD. The 9.7 ABV is felt by the end, and it was an enjoyable drinking experience. I would say that I would do a head-to-head taste test with Hercules, but then I would be drunk! Recommended for all the hop-heads (myself included!), for sure. Great brew."
"A good beer, definitely worth the money if you can find it."
"Pours a bright and clear orange color with a decent size frothy white head. Smell is of sweet caramel malts and citric hop aromas. The hops smell of lemons, grass and flowers. Not too shabby. Sweet upfront, with a bitter citric hop edge. Grapefruits and oranges make an appearance. The sweet malt backbone is thick and sugary, almost syrup like. Not too shabby at all. Nice thick like mouthfeel, as I expect for a double IPA. Pretty damn drinkable, if you dont let the sweetness get to you. Really not a shabby brew here from Avery."
"Notes: Balanced, but not expected to be balanced. Leaving an educated drinker slightly bewildered. Very easy to drink. Maybe the hops have faded, but there was only a couple of days between my purchase and my consumption, so it didn't fade on my watch. Regardless, the beer seems quite balanced, and I would definately enjoy this one more often if it weren't almost 10 percent abv."
"Wow, you can actually smell pungent and citrusy hops just upon opening the bottle! Avery usually delivers, and this one is no exception. It pours a slightly hazy reddish-copper body with orangeish highlights beneath a short but creamy head of white. Unfortunately, the head doesn't hold quite as well as might be hoped for (but with 9.7% alcohol by volume that's to be expected!), and it does leaves some thin rings of lace about the glass. A firmly caramelish and delicately biscuity malt comes into play within the aroma, although the hops are still clearly present with notes of grass, pineapple, orange peel, dried pine needles, and muddled grapefruit. In the mouth its filling and dextrinous as the very-fine-bubbled carbonation warms and becomes airy before sliding away like silk pajamas on silk sheets. The flavor delivers a heavier blow than the aroma suggests with its solid maltiness ducking and weaving between punches of hop flavor and hits of solid bitterness. There's no real pattern to the way that it appears on the palate, and slaps of hops or hits of malt seem to come and go in a different fashion with each sip. Everycomponent is always there, but certain characteristics just seem to pop at times. The one constant, however, is it's lingering, resinous and citrus-fruit-rind finish. There's bitterness there as well, but it doesn't come across as being raspy because of the thin but sticky layer of sweet malt that so stealthily hides itself while slowly receeding. It's a really nice, very well-balanced IPA that offers a decent amount of changing character in its profile; but might actually be lacking in complexity due to it's being """too balanced""" - if that's possible. Still, this IPA rocks! The alcohol rarely appears, and its bitterness never overwhelms the palate! You can't drink too many because of the strength, but it's definitely drinkable."
"Served in a chimay goblet, is a pretty light amber color with a frothy thick white head. Looks extremely nice. Not nearly the nose I would have expected from a double IPA, the hops aroma is present, but subtle. You do not smell the alcohol. Taste is quite good. While not in the nose, the hops are strong in the drink. Not overwhelming, but they nicely balance the alcohol. Feels thick in the mouth, somewhat less carbonated that my taste. This affects the drinkabilty as well, and too heavy in effect to drink all night"
"All told, I think the 11 was superior, but this is interesting at the very least."
"Overall, a sipper and not a quaffer."
"A """kick in the pants Double IPA"""."
"Last swigs: Runs the obstacle corse between Troegs Nugget Nectar and 90 minute. Warrior hops are in there somewhere! AVERY's Eleven is better. Send more kegs this way as this was only on a sixthel at McMennamin's where they refused to allow this to be a growler fill. We went home with Yards TJ in lieu."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful brew where a ton of hops are well-balanced by the malts and the combination masks the high alcoholic content of the beer"
"Overall Impression: The Maharaja rules firmly but fairly. His harsh hop slap is backed by a caring malt base of support. His alcoholic strength is hidden until it is too late and you have succumbed to the inevitable. I would join his court happily when I gain the opportunity in the future. I welcome you to join me."
"Light clear golden orange with a small 1/2""" head that dies out but leaves som funky lace patterns. The aromas are very sweet. Sweey and hoppy with some honey notes, and biscuity malts as well. The taste is weet with some nice citrusy zesty hoppy notes, and some biscuity malts and booze. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is hindered, because this Double IPA is just too sweet and one dimensional. Bound to get cloying before this bomber is done. Still Avery has done much worse (and much better!)"
"High marks for drinkability."
"On tap poured into a half-pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with one finger of head. There are lace rings left down the sides of the glass. The smell is full of floral hops. There's a nice citrusy aroma as well. It really comes out at you. The taste has a whopping fresh hop blast, but there's a good amount of maltiness to it as well. There is a good balance between hop bitterness and hop flavor. Neither is overpowering. There's 9.7% alcohol in this beer, but almost none shows up in the flavor. The mouthfeel is exceptionally thick and strong, and coats the tongue wonderfully. The drinkability is superb for a double IPA. I could just keep drinking and drinking this fine fine brew. This is Avery's best beer hands down."
"Notes: Not for the faint of heart. Slightly unbalanced for me but I think it's a very good example of the style. Still, there are more out there for me to sample..."
"Not too sweet, but assertive caramelly malt. Like the caramel over a sour granny. Chewy side bites. Great sour, tangy, piney, hop portfolio. Lime zest sorbet between bites of butterscotch cookies. Such a joy to spin the glass and watch the bubbles tornado around. Cool. I love the mouth on this."
"I liked this one. I can see where some might think it was a bit sweet, but I couldn't get over the aroma and pretty much kept my nose in the glass. I almost dipped my finger in to dab some of this behind my ears! Alright, on tap at redbones, served in a goblet. Deep copper in color, the small white head dissipated a bit and left that petri dish look floating on the top. I dug and dug and dug again the piney and candied hop arroma. Man did this beer smell good. I thought the body was a bit chewy, but still enjoyable. Tastewise, you start with some initial hop sweetness, prickly carbonation, and then you end with some hop bitterness (but not too bitter)."
"Not a complex beer, but with such a solid cohesive structure, additional complexity would just get in the way."
"22oz Bomber $7.25. Bottled in 2005. This is god damn delicious. Some shade of amber and clear.Thick clinging head. Sweet fruity citrus hop aromas with notes of peaches, oranges, pine and tropical fruits of delight. Doughy aromas from malt also add to the pleasure. Body is full, syrupy and slightly sticky. Lots of bitterness in the flavor from start to finish. Sweet and super hoppy. Alcohol well hidden. Overall pretty much in line with most other good Imperial IPA's."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Bright copper to orange in color with a thick tan head made of tight, dense bubbles. The nose has a great hop forward flavor. Citrus, hop flower, and dare I say a little cannabis is delivered up front. There is a mild candy malt aroma. Caramel with a hint of dates. More malt than I expected. Wow, very nice flavor. A lot of citrus grapefruit up front, but the balance of malt sweetness is very refreshing. This isnt just another hop bomb. The balance of the caramel and citrus come together for a pleasant tanginess on the finish. Its all tied together nicely with a slight alcohol warming, a mild, slightly slick mouth feel. Very nice beer."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear copper- amber with a nice off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Pineapple, pine and grapefruit aromas, citrus, pine, melon, pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Full bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry and bitter, alcohol well hidden and very drinkable."
"Currents of frothy, big bite foam run through the middle of a quiet lake of covering head, about ¼ inch thick that, once settled, has corpuscles of lace and generous stick. Juicy orange hue with 100% clarity and some slower than molasses going uphill on a cold day action. Nose is full of hop, like a green-leafed nose gay, and I can almost see the srystals; seems like an almost orange/raspberry sweetness to it. Very deep hop core, but not overly bitter, and a big enough malt profile where I think this almost verges on a barleywine; clover and some rock candy sweetness later. Better than the Wailing Wench."
"I'm impressed with this brew. Its weird (in a good way) how malts take center stage yet it has enough hop to satisfy all but the most rabid of hopheads. One of Avery's better """big beers""" for sure."
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice off white foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carobonation is present. An aroma of hops, pine and a touch of caramel and malt. The flavor was of hops and heavy on the caramel sweet aspect. It had a medium body and a slightly creamy texture. The finish was sweet with just a touch of astrigency. A sweeter style for a double IPA, but still very good."
"One heck of a fine offering from Avery...continuing to impress me time after time."
"Baby oh baby --- a new Avery brew on tap at the Blind Tiger, life is good! a double IPA , even better, this poured a brilliant shade of amber, clear and left big time lacing. White head, hoppy/grapefuit nose. Crunching blast of citric hops, balanced upon lucious layers of malt. Very enjoyable brew. Royally enjoyable, a fine creation in brewing, seek and enjoy!"
"Drinkability: very well balanced, the hop bitterness does not build to overwhelming proportions,"
"This is most likely my favorite of the dictator series. With Avery claiming this to be similar to there """eleven""" I was excited to give it a try. I believe this is the last one of the dictator series but I'm not for sure. I cant say anything bad about any of the beers in the series, there all good. I wonder what a Hitler would have tasted like. Oh well. The pour was excellent flowing with red and orange entwined. The hops are very noticeable and a slight bit over powering, as they should be. This beer was very crisp, and not to much malt which I liked. I was impressed by the 112 IBU's and after drinking I might have even guessed it was more. All a round a good beer from every point of view. I see myself drinking more and glad Avery made it a regular item instead of a seasonal."
"Overall, another Avery """big beer""" disappointment for me - they sound soooo good, but don't live up to expectations for me. I've had much better IIPAs. I don't like the sweet melon in an IIPA, the alcohol is a bit much, and I don't care for the hop flavor and finish. Great Divide's Hercules is MUCH more up my alley. To be fair, as I finish the 22, it becomes less un-appealing."
"The taste is lightly sweet with an intense fresh American hop character that plays up the fruit character of this beer. This beer finishes with a bit of astringent sharp hoppiness, a solid bitterness and a bit of alcoholic bite. This beer is quite smooth, and even has a nice creamy body that is quite pleasant and helps to make this beer that much more drinkable. The flavors of this beer run the gamut from grapefruit, tangerine, mint, basil, pine needles, and candied orange peel. This beer has a bunch of hops in it, but it is not all that balanced towards the bitterness, there is a solid malt backbone, that while not particularly noticeable over the hops is very important to the fruity hoppiness that characterizes this beer."
"The departs the 22-ounce brown bottle a clean and clear dark amber color with the head creamy and light tan in color, the size modest, after its decline the lace forms a thick and sticky sheet that clings mightily to the glass. Nose is rich in sweet malt with a magnificent hop floral spiciness with is fresh and appetizing, start is sweet malt and the top middling in its feel. Finish determined in it hop spicy bite, the acidity meaningful and the aftertaste dry and pleasant, another great beer from a magnificent brewery."
