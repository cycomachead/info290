"Very syrupy and sweet. Hides the alcohol decently but a little too cloying."
""
"Had on draft at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Never had anything by this brewer before so it was a complete shot in the dark. Not bad at all, but nothing that re-writes the book on amazing IPAs. Would order again, and would try more from Odell if given the opportunity."
""
""
"Overall - This is among the best DIPAs I have had."
""
""
""
""
"Would absolutely seek out and purchase again."
""
""
""
"This is not a well done IIPA. Just awful."

"really good IIPA... well balanced.. solid"

"O- Very nice, seems to have a lot of Simcoe hops with an aroma somewhat similar to Hopslam but to a lesser degree. Pretty cool that this is a year round beer, I would probably buy it many times if I could get it in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's somewhat syrupy goodness masks how strong this bad-boy is. Full of mouth-burning hops that are balanced by a strong malty backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This double IPA is balanced to perfection. The citrus nodes stay on your palate long after a sip leaving you craving more. Starts hoppy with bite but finishes very smooth. As an IPA snob , I am quite shocked at the impression it had made."

"Twelve ounce bottle.  Pours a crystal clear honey orange with a finger thick white head.  Heavy lacing as the beer is consumed.  Smells of citrus and orange blossom.  Tastes of grapefruit/citrus, light earthy/grassy, barley, sweet malts.  Medium body and a bit on the heavy side with the carbonation, pine and citrus resin on the tongue with a sweet malt aftertaste.  I recall Odell being exceptional when I visited the brewery almost 10 years ago and this was no exception.  I really enjoyed this beer."

"Mouth Feel: Nice smooth coating that lasts."

"Pours deep orange topped by white head. Aroma of citrus with vanilla bean, grass, mint, pine. Tastes of juicy citrus, vanilla bean, fresh cut grass, pine, light fruit, , booze, bitterness and mild grapefruit towards the finish. Heavy in body with medium carbonation. A thick, juicy IPA."
""
""
""
""
"I am absolutely in love with this beer. Its a lot maltier than most doubles but it balances well with the amount of hops up front. No heat coming from the 9.3%. Plenty of fruity flavor's coming out, just like you would expect from this style. Well done Odell."
""
"Floral hops, resin, dank cannabis, grapefruit, mango, and papaya form the aroma. Very complex. Flavor reveals a tropical fruit dominant base, which becomes resiny and bitter in the finish. Muddled mango, pineapple, and tangerine add intrigue. Lightly sweet caramel and toasted malt are accented by herbal notes. Flavoring hop dominant example of the style, with enough malt character to support, but not overwhelm. Very drinkable, for the abv. Becomes earthy as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"This is a very good double IPA and great starting point for the uninitiated. On the nose it's got tropical fruits, pineapple was the biggest one for me, but also mango and lemon. Pours an opaque golden color with a white head. It's medium bodied, astonishingly easy drinking considering the ABV, and packs a prickly hop bite. On the palate it retains those fruits, peach, pineapple, mango, lemon, tangerine, with an excellent balance to both the alcohol and bitterness. Fantastic IPA I can't wait to have again."
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, copper coloring, with a slow carbonation flow, and a dense, foamy, off-white head. Nose of tropical fruit, with mango, melon, and apricot, on a toasted backbone, with subtle piney notes. Flavors are melon forward, with piney and grassy hops notes to follow. Very well balanced. Subtle pepper and roasted notes. Smooth and light, with a fruity and bitter aftertaste. Frothy, clean finish. Very solid beer."

"No date. This has a gorgeous golden amber color with a frothy white head. The smell is more malty than hoppy with a nice fresh baked bagel smell coming through. Taste is malt focused as well, with rich caramel malts and toffee notes, balanced by just a little hop flavors. Perhaps there is hop fade here, but if so it didn't translate to lingering bitterness as it often does, as I get none. Really drinkable for a DIPA.  Overall a wonderful DIPA and a refreshingly """English""" take on the style."

"Pours a slightly murky glowing orange with a medium off white foamy head. Receded quickly and leaves a good deal of lacing. The aroma is marvelously sweet. Pine, citrus, and honey lead the way. Some light floral hops along with the citrus. The citrus aromas are strong, with loads of grapefruit, lemon zest, and orange peel. The taste comes with an explosion of juicy citrus and sweet caramel malts, along with some nice pine resin. Decent amount of hops, not enough to knock you on your butt. The malts and pine subside a bit as it warms, letting the citrus further shine. A lot of sweetness going on here. Actually remind me a bit of an American Barleywine. A little bitterness is present with the sweetness, but not too much. A little bit of bite from the alcohol as it warms. Never seen a beers flavor transform as the temp changes quite like this one. Not much carbonation. Despite being a bit sticky, this one is a dangerously easy drinker. One of the most masterfully masked ABV that I've ever seen as well. Overall, not the strongest DIPA you'll see, but the balance and ease of drinking is what makes this one a must try."

"Poured from a bottle a hazy gold with a finger and a half head that slowly dissipates, leaving dotted lacing. On your nose right away you get citrus and of course hops, great pine. The first large drink you get some bitterness that is immediately replaced with some sweet citrus and malt, and finishes with that IPA bitterness, but not too bitter, just right. The swallow leaves your mouth a little dry, and the aftertaste is actually sweet and a little sticky. The carbonation is low but the beer itself has some substance, a weightier feel on your tongue. With the alcohol content, was surprised at the absence of a strong alcohol taste. As this beer warmed up a bit, it seemed to get sweeter and smoother."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty tasty and well put together, but not particularly hoppy, and really pushing the envelope on the DIPA categorization at 9.8%."
""
""
""
""
""

"M - very smooth, medium carbonation. Ends surprisingly medium/sweet"

"Nice med to full body taste.  Not overly bitter.  Will try again."

"Another great IPA. Got this one through trade from an Owner of a local craft beer liquor store by me. If you can get your hands on one in California get it!"

""

"O - A very nice DIPA. Very hops forward with some malty sweetness. One of the better DIPAs you can try."
"Very tart taste. Surprisingly clear.  Gold color, white head.  Strong hop smell.  I must say I can't feel the pineapple or tropical fruit.  Good beer though, quite hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am just beginning to get into IPA and while previously I disliked the intense bitterness of DIPAs I can beginning to fall in love with them. Perfect to have one or two this beer seems to be the best of the DIPAs I have tried so far though there are many more on my list. I would definitely give this one a try even of you don't think you are a fan of bitterness the prevalent citrus and pine qualities of this one may make you a believer."

"Overall: This is a fantastic Double IPA that is right in line with my personal flavor preferences. Its bold and assertive in the hop flavor with just enough malt to provide a good balance but the juicy, citrus notes are the star of the show."
""
""
"Can't say enough about this beer.  Put it in a glass next to PTE and I don't know if I could tell you which is which.  Maybe that means I am a nOOb, but I don't care.  It is readily available by the four pack where I live and it's awesome.  Full of in-your-face hop flavor, but nicely balanced and not overly """boozy""" tasting.  Keep up the good work O'Dells!"

"Excellent beer overall, but the bottles I have had little to no carbonation. That's a shame and may or may not be the fault of Odell, but either way, it affects how the beer tastes. Even so, this is a really nice beer. Well-balanced between the hops and the all malt that would be necessary to get such a high ABV."
""
""
"Overall: This is what one should look for in an IPA and is now my favorite DIPAafter trying it. I recommend this beer at slightly warmer than fridge temperature. This is what I believe is the pinnacle of Double IPAs. Thank you Odell! Slightly lower than their IPA."

"O: A great example of a Double IPA that doesn't destroy your mouth but provides plenty of the signature elements - strong pine resin, sticky mouthfeel, boozy but not too much. Not a citrus bomb on the nose or in flavor, but the malt elements compliment the heavy pine features."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With the taste comes a dank forefront and then immediately the fruit comes crashing through my palate. More of the fruit notes of cherry and pineapple come through now, and a sweet tartness is present...it seems to offset the hop bitterness. Sweetness seems to hide the abv. Wow indeed. A new favorite DIPA. All the characteristics I love, and a drink ability off the charts!"

"o - Overall I liked this one a lot, and liked it a ton better than the normal Odell IPA. If I could buy 4/6ers of this regularly I definitely would. Lots of citrus and tropical notes with no bitterness, highly recommended."

"Overall, this is a great, unique DIPA. I dont usually prefer the malt/caramel heavy IPA/DIPAs but this has enough citrus characteristics to properly balance this out and elevate it to an outstanding brew."
""
""
""
"Overall really more malty than hoppy it is quite mild flavored for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber/honey color with thick foamy head and excellent lacing. Aroma is citrusy but not very overpowering. Hard to discern, even in a tulip. You can smell the alcohol, though. Taste is very malty, very little hops. Smooth, boozy taste. Very little aftertaste. Good beer but not usually what I am looking for. Excellent for a cold night by a fire, sipping."

"The dimensions of hops. Very fresh and clean flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Your daily dose of hop oils, for the next week, in one glass. A nice clean base under it too, makes for a real kick in the pants. The one two punch distracts you from the heavy alcohol load it carries, but I'm quickly slowing to small sips which burn my lips slightly. We might need a new category for this one, a Quad IPA. These dials go to 11."

"MF – Smooth, a little creamy. Medium body with a dry finish. 4.5"

"O: Very bright and drinkable IPA. Doesn't kill your palate with IBUs or heavy mouthfeel. A little less sweet than the normal IPA and stronger IBUs"

""
""
""
""
"Not bad at all. I will enjoy the rest of the growler, and really like the balance here. Though I feel there are better version of the style sitting on the shelves. Double Jack and Endeavor to name two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is absolutely delicious and better than Hopslam because of the light malt and more vibrant hops. This has a best by date of 4/1/14, which makes the beer almost 100 days old. I imagine that this beer is better when fresh, but that is pure conjecture."

"O: Good, not great. I definitely prefer the regular Odell IPA. Certainly worth a try though, and glad I was able to try it. Thanks fatbeats!"
""

"Overall I would definitely have again. 'Nuff said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is among my favorites and maybe the best double IPA I've had. Myrcenary will definitely be in my regular rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a winner in my book... A refreshing change of pace from some of the triple hopped monsters out there..."
"If Odell distributed to my area, they would get a lot of my money."
""
""
""
"O: Quite good and tasty."
""
"O4 a solid dipa. Great in flavor and smell, but was shocke at the lack of head. Nice spicyness from the hops pair perfectly with these wings."
""
"O- I am a shitty person to rate DIPA's, but I try (as you shake your head yes then no). I am just not into malty DIPA's. I need citrus"
""
""
""
"Not tremendously complex, but a very balanced enjoyable DIPA that focuses on the malt as well as the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good DIPA, very resinous and balanced but otherwise nothing mindblowing compared to the likes of Heady and Abrasive, which is not necessarily a bad thing."
"Overall: An outstandingly drinkable DIPA. Balanced is the biggest key here. Hop tones are kept in check with plenty of hops to pull you in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours kind of hazy orange with a decently creamy head. Smells summer-ish for an IPA. Sort of floral. Really heavy bitterness but a good balance with hops. I love super hoppy stuff so for a double IPA I'd like to taste more hoppiness, but an extremely consistent flavor from one of my favorite breweries"

"Mouth: Heavy bodied and smooth for an IPA, not as sharp as most. Fairly lightly carbonated for the style. Pleasant tickling characteristic that lingers on tongue after swallowing."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has a brownish amber color as well as hints of dark orange. The beer is clear and filtered with a very foamy and slightly creamy off white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer smell has a strong grapefruit smell with hints of pineapple and strawberry as well as bits of sugar. The beer tastes similar to the how it smells. The beer has very sweet and caramel tastes along with the hop bitterness. The taste has grapefruit hops but other flavors dominate the taste. The sugary sweetness arrives in the form of pineapple and slight hints of strawberry flavors. The beer has a heavy body with a smooth and really clean feel to it. However, the beer still has a slightly sticky aftertaste. A very good beer and one of the best DIPAs that I have had. My only regret is that ODell does not distribute to my state."

"This beer has always been great and even at 3 months out I'm still immensely enjoying this bottle. Like I said before, the approachability is off the charts while still being juicy and delicious. I have yet to have an Odell beer that's even just OK, they're all great examples for the style, Myrcenary included."
""
""
"Hot damn.... I am re rating this, had it at a 4 but it is much better then that. I only bought a single since the date was 11/29/13... I assume it is in the area of 5 months old... If I find it fresher I would buy cases if it this good a month before the date!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark blond with white head. Great fruity hop aroma, like a fresh fruit basket. in taste a very soft and friendly hop bomb. hides the alcohol contant very well. not an aggressive bitterness but a good example of a well balanced hop bitterness and fruity hoptaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: this is really good stuff. great hop flavor and aroma, not overwhelming or overpowering. just a great double IPA. this should be on more peoples radar."
""
""
""
""
"Bang for the buck: it's not as good a deal as New Belgium Rampant IPA, but it's pretty darn good. Definitely in my top 20, and maybe in my top 10, just cuz the fruit is so unique!"
""
""
""
""
"This is very smoothe drinking for a... HOLY SHIT 9.3?!? OK, maybe that's hyperbole, but I would have guessed mid six just based on what's going on in my mouth (that came out wrong). But seriously: this is a very well crafted, well balanced beer from a brewery that I was largely unfamiliar with before moving to the midwest. Odell in general has been a GREAT discovery, and Myrcenary is no different. For an every day shelf DIPA, I'm very glad to be in their distro."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Over time I've really started to appreciate IPAs with malts that I feel balance the hops well and don't completely destroy your palette. This goes in as one of the top tier DIPAs out there."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Myrcenary pours a hazy golden color with a small lacing head. There is a harsh sweet malty aroma, with hints of an oily hoppy kick. Taste is more balanced, harsher malty backbone, with bold hoppy flavors. The hoppy flavor is more oily then it is floral. While its well carbonated, there is a """flat""" feel. Overall in my opinion its quite overrated, too sweet but too harsh."
"Overall, a great DIPA and certainly on par with many of the best in the business. The only difference is it's easier to obtain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Probably up in the second to highest tier in terms of """smooth (malt-forward) DIPAs""". Not a punchy clean hop blast so it is probably hit or miss for hop heads but I definitely enjoyed this one and would get this again."
""
""
""
"O-This is a great IIPA with aggressive hops and a tempering balance of toasty caramel malts. It looks like a IIPA is supposed to look, smells like a IIPA is supposed to smell, feels like an IIPA is supposed to feel and, most importantly, tastes like an IIPA is supposed to taste. What I particularly enjoy is how there are juicy citrus hops, but also a tempering pine/cedar flavor and just enough caramel to to keep things in balance. Its not a one-trick pony. The feel is also wonderful. Top notch."

"Mouuthfeel is very astringent. Got the great complexity in flavours of other American IPAs I have tried but a bit too rich for me at the moment. Maybe need to revisit this beer in the future when I can do it more justice."
"Maybe it's that August weather in the Central Texas, but I'm still imbibing those big IPAs to cool me off at the end of a hot day. O'dell still doesn't distribute to the Lone Star State just yet, but when it does, Myrcenary will be welcomed with open arms."
""
""
""
"Taste- Sweetness comes first from the malt a light caramel note then the grapefruit rind with some fruity orange sweetness from the alcohol with a light warmth. Almost a taste on the tongue like I ate Fruity Pebbles earlier. Definitely not super fruity, well in balance. Dry cracker malt finishes this beer with some lingering hops."

"A very nice beer, an explosion of tropical fruits in both the aroma and taste. Lush pineapple aroma starts you off and continues into the taste coupled with mango and citrus- particularly lemon and tangerine. Very nicely balanced, and a different hop presentation than you usually get. Very well done!"

"A: Deep gold to light copper in color, thin layer of head, some miniscule sediment visible in the beer 4.25, S: Smells strongly of peach and strawberries, some honeysuckle and melon and maybe a hint of wet grass, very pleasing and refreshing nose that maybe doesn’t overpower but certainly provides some complexity – 4.25, T: Honey like sweetness, strong hop bite to the point of almost being tannic, grapefruit and orange zest as well as some pineapple – 4.25, M: Drying alcohol provides slight grit, quite a bit of body and viscosity – 4.50, D: Extremely drinkable especially considering that it is a double IPA, alcohol is masked very well all around a very nice beer – 4.50"

"Myrcenary pours a honey color with a solid 2 finger white foam head. Head retention was excellent as was lacing. Aromas of grapefruit and sweet malts. Flavor best can described as juicy with tropical fruit and sweet malt backbone balanced by grapefruit bitterness that turns a bit floral/herbal. For such a high ABV, the alcohol is well hidden. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that finishes slightly dry. Very drinkable (for such a high ABV) and extremely tasty. Overall, a very well balanced and crafted Double IPA. Highly recommended."

"As an extra, the expectations were low, and it did not disappoint in that regard.Not getting the huge ratings on this relatively pedestrian IIPA: world class? really?! Overall,one big MEH!"

"The beer pours a cloudy golden amber with a fluffy off-white head that laces down the glass into a thin halo around the perimeter. The nose is passionfruity/slightly floral/white grapey and has a hint of candy sweetness. The taste is quite distinct and unique; surging sugary sweetness and a very interesting tropical fruit hop profile make this similar to drinking a slightly muted dreadnaught. The mouthfeel is medium-full and potently sweet bodied with creamy effervescence, masked alcohol, and has a modestly bitter (yet incredibly hoppy) finish. This is a delicious 4-pack, especially considering the price, and I hope to try it fresher in the future."

"O: Nice, very smooth DIPA, good balance"

"Actually kind of surprised the rating is so high for this. I had a reasonably fresh bottle, so it wasn't old or anything. Perhaps I'm not that partial to the dank and resinous bomb. I enjoy those flavors, sure, but not quite in this capacity. And the malt, being so sweet, does more overwhelming harm than balancing good. Not an awful beer, but merely average at best. I don't want my DIPAs to be this slow of sippers."

"Very nice DIPA - way more mellow than I expected from the aroma, but totally works. You'd never guess this was such a huge beer, considering how smooth and easy drinking it is, but you know it's a DIPA because of the complex hop explosion. Highly recommended."

"Overall: My friend and I like to call this the 'Urban Elephant' - referring to Odell's (wonderful) IPA. Overall, Odell did very well with this DIPA. It's a nice change - like moving from the country to the city (or vice versa.) There's a raw power in its hop content."
""
""
""
"O: This is fucking amazing, and I'd buy it all the time if it were readily available to be, but alas, I randomly found this one in a bar in Florence, Italy...would definitely even consider trading for this one! This is phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - An amazing feat of a beer by Odell. My current favorite of their offerings and one of the best IPA experiences I've had. So glad to have this year round and available near me."

""
""
""

"Overall- Pretty middling for a DIPA; nothing I've not seen before and borderline overhopped, too boozy for my liking. If you're of the """More hops! Higher ABV!""" mindset, you'll probably like this, but I'm not really a fan."

""
""
""

"Overall/Comments: This came highly recommended and it lived up to it's hype!!! An excellent very well put together and well balanced DIPA that was more tropical than any I have ever experienced!! I really enjoyed this!! Highly recommended!! Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA @ 9.3% ABV. Consumed 4/15/2013."

"This beer was fantastic. Orange glow sticky head. Pineapple bomb on the nose. A little sticky mouthfeel but nice and full. Flavo ris a giant pinepapple bomb as well with lots of other tropical fruit flavors. Malt leaves a nice sticky sweetness in the mouth. Bitterness is absent, purely balance, and alcohol is non-existent. An excellent beer and wish I could get my hands on more of it."

"O: A nice beer but not on a level that I would put with the likes of other reasonably available DIPAs like Ruination or Sculpin. Definitely worth a try though -- a nice beer with a great name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pleased to have a 4-pack of this brew, definitely enjoyed it and would drink it again. Probably would not trade an arm and a leg for it, but if I was in the area I'd seek it out. Not quite world class, but certainly excellent."
""
"O - This is a solid Double IPA, and moderately priced at about 10 bucks for a 4 pack, but still a bit to overpriced IMO. Would drink this on special occasions or something, but still a little over my budget."
""
""
"Overall: A great DIPA, certainly of the dry west-coast variety, but does have some sweetness that is accentuated by the fruity hops. It is more a homage to hop character, with a restrained bitterness and minimal malt character that lead to a blank canvas for the hops to display their subtle nuances throughout the sip and into the dry finish. Very interesting and very well executed, I would absolutely get it again given the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best IPAs in the world. There is a certain fruitiness to the smell and taste which do well to mask the surprising 9.3% ABV. This beer is extremely dangerously drinkable with a crisp finish. Odell has a real winner here. I've had both on tap and from the bottle and they are equally as impressive."
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, well carbonated, sticky and juicy on the tongue. This wasn't what I was expecting, and the intense tropical flavors were a welcome breath of fresh air with all the citrus/pine bombs that're out there these days."

"Appears a very pale gold with heavy lacing. Nose is heavy with aromatic hops, pine oil, grapefruit, weed, and resin come through strong. Taste is hop forward with earthy hops, piney hops, and more hops. Not much malt to back things up, but tasty either way. The taste is hop forward too but with a nice balance of bitterness. Grapefruit and pine are the strongest. Mouthfeel is light and heavily carbonated. Very tasty dipa."
""
""

""
"O- A very solid DIPA, easy-drinking with a great aroma. Definitely give this one a try."

""
""

"Wow! This is by far the best beer I've had from Odell. Actually one of the best DIPA's I've had as well. Very complex mix of hops and yeast, it's like sweet hop nectar."
"O – A truly unique beer and another killer beer from Odell's. They truly excel with the hoppy stuff, and this one is one of their best examples."
""
""
""
""
"I may LOVE IPA's, Stouts and Bourbon Porters, BUT I bend the knee to American Double IPA's, the Lord and the SR-71 Blackbird!"
""
""
"O - Not a bad DIPA. It drinks quite smoothly for having 9.3% ABV. It gives you a good hop hit, but expected a slightly more pronounced impact on my senses."

"Excellent Double IPA and a real treat to get to try this. Big thanks to Mark for this one. Every hoppy beer I’ve had from Odell has been excellent...they sure know there way around some hops!"
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm glad I took the time to re-review this one so as to really enjoy the flavors. If you are in search of a superbly balanced DIPA then look no further. I'm shocked this beer doesn't get more hype, maybe because it's available year round at a steal ($10/4-pack). Would I drink it again? You betcha, three left in the fridge that will be calling my name all week."

"This poured out as a clear golden yellow color with a white foamy hea on top. The retention and lacing are good. The smell is a little weaker than I expected. Subtle floral an fruity notes on the nose. The taste is pretty strong, lots of lemony citrus flavors. Nice malt back bone. The mouthfeel is smooth and oily, nice easy going carbonation. Overall very good. Really really good stuff."

"Overall - This is absolutely one of the best DIPA's, or any variation of the pale ale style, that I have ever drank. Outstanding craftsmanship, hats of to the O'Dell brewery, unbelieveable. This is one of the most highly recommended beers the Condor has ever reviewed, this beer really surprised me. Took me totally off guard with its' quality, and I'm not really a DIPA guy. I will buy this again, for sure."

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy, classic golden color with a short, antique white head. Thin lacing appears in asymmetrical fashion. It has a malty nose with some orange and lemon citrus esters. Mouthfeel is very well-balanced. Full, a little oily, and crisp on the finish. Pretty malty flavor. Grapefruit emerges in the flavor, where it was absent in the bouquet. Some lemon on the finish. A little too malty for my taste, but still a very well-engineered brew."
""
""

"Great beer! the coloring is just right for the taste a smell, a deeper color than your standard DIPA, with more of an amber look to it. Smell is perfect, matching the taste in a very interesting way. Big floral and hoppy smell up front, with slight hints of yeast. Taste is perfect, a lot of hops, but enterprisingly not very bitter. A great taste with enterprisingly mild bitterness. I've never encountered a beer quite like this, and I am glad I did. Truly a great beer. Should be a must try for everyone."
"Overall, I really like this one, and like I said, I would get it again and would probably fork over the extra buck or two even though it's a 4-pack. I don't really think I could see straight if I drank more than four of these, anyway. Nice job OBC!"
""
""
""
"Pale, lemony golden color. Almost hazy enough to look unfiltered, maybe it is. Small tight head that is gone all too quickly. Big grassy and lemon citrus aroma. Lots of hop flavor. Caramel malt sweetness. Lingering bitterness. I cant get enough of the balance between the hop flavor and the sticky malt I just love it when done right. Very solid mouthfeel. Great malty backbone just pulls this whole thing together. A great beer for my money, wish it could be a full time experience."
""
"O - One of my most interesting brews as of late. I'll keep some back in the fridge for special occasions, not an everyday drinker in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not a blow my socks off beer, but a very well executed one. I like the fruity notes in the background. A very good beer. If you come across it, try it! Solid, and very good!"
"O: The aroma on this beer includes a great hoppiness with a ton of tropical fruits. The flavor, though, seems a bit muddled."
""
"Love this beer....just sayin' Lacing noticeable but diminishing. A very inviting sweet , citrusy, floral aroma abounds. The taste again was citrusy and sweet.. slight pine like bitter, but hops are very flowery and sweet. Every sip was crisp and delicate. A beer full of liveliness....nice hoppy feel on the tongue and nose. I would order more."
"O - Excellent DIPA. I am not always big on this style but this one is something I could see myself ordering more than once. Great balance, not too sweet and tons of hop flavor. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
"An ode to myrcene indeed. This beer made my realize my favorite DIPA's are all about the late addition aromatic hops and not so much the intensely bitter, resinous ones that seem to be more common. This is my first beer from Odell's and the bar can't be set much higher. I would be more than willing to pay full price for several fresh cases of this perfectly crafted double IPA."
"O: Top notch stuff. Odell knows how to make IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with moderate levels of carbonation that produce a fairly smooth-flowing beer. Hints of ethanol in the nostrils, throat, and back of the palate when the beer hits these regions, as expected in a 9.3% beer. Finishes dry, as expected from the substantial hop presence in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the first beer from Odell and I am very impressed. Makes great use of tropical flavors with solid bitterness. The mouthfeel is phenomenal. I wish I had a few more to enjoy. This is one I will try to track down again."
""
""
""
"T: A rich sweet malty flavor held back by a load of sticky citrus hops. Honey, some melon and a bunch of sticky hop resin. A tasty beer."
"Poured into a snifter this beer is fairly clear golden-straw color with just a bit of hazy, likely from dry hopping. The head diminished to a skim but is very sticky and leaves beautiful lacing along the sides of the glass. The aroma is intensely hoppy--gobs of orange citrus, fruity, and resiny. Beneath all the hops is a touch of sweetness from the malt. The flavor is quite hoppy--very fruity and floral with solid hop bitterness. The malt is not lost in this beer and some candy-like sweetness plays off the solid bitterness imparting a long-lasting dance of bittersweetness. The body is perfect for the style--full yet not chewy with moderate carbonation. Overall a wonderful DIPA--well worth picking up a 4 pack!"
"Note to self: Ranked #34 Top American Double / Imperial IPA when I tried it."
""
""
"O: I really like this beer. I would never have know that the ABV is 9.3%. It should be sipped but I found it way too easy to enjoy. I will definitely have this again. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- So far enjoyable. Can't wait to try the other two bottles in the four pack."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'd like to try it on tap out in CO, but I won't be seeking this out until then."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, a nice hazy golden-amber colored ale is topped with a thinner, frothy, white head, good retention & lacing. Aromas are amazing - tropical fruits, nice floral hop bouquet, pineapple, mango, wow. 1st sip gushes with fresh, juicy, ripened pineapple, with orange, passionfruit, peach. Biscuity malt makes an appearance but the sweetness gives way to a more pungent mango/piny bitterness, but finishes oh so clean. Alcohol is well concealed. Mouth-feel is creamy but a little resiny, hop oils coat the palate and ride out the intense pineapple and mango flavors. Overall, a truly remarkable DIPA. One of the best i've tried, especially for its uniqueness. This beer reaffirms why I love beer so much! Unbelievable."
""
"el are also noticeable. Hops to the Face! The beer starts out somewhat mellow before the hop bitterness dominates the pallet. The caramel malt provides just enough of a backbone to balance the onslaught of tropical, citrus, and herbal hop flavors that shine throughout. Medium in both body and carbonation, the brew finishes clean and dry. We have said it before, and we will say it again; Odell Brewing Company is utilizing hops better then any other brewery in Colorado!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While decent, I can't say I found this to be an exceptional IPA, on par with top quality IPA's such as Le Cumbre Elevated or Avery's Dugana. Both the taste and mouthfeel were unmemorable. However, a decent stand-in if nothing better is available, with no objectionable traits; balanced if a bit bland."
""
""
""
""
"An excellent DIPA. I definitely can't recommend it fresh from the brewery enough!"
""
"O: Not my cup of tea. I probably won't try this again but this was a good tick as it was an extra and on my GOTS list. Thanks Lobo."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, evenly balanced, and refreshing."
""
"O-a solid DIPA with a decent balance of flavors, but not in my upper tier"
"O - An above average DIPA, but not one of my favorites. Somewhat boozy with a muted nose. Nice tropical fruit notes though."
""
""
""
"O- This was a hard one for me. Looks and tastes great, but the smell and mouthfeel knock it down a bit. A solid DIPA, but definitely not my favorite. 4"

"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a hint of rubber as well as some tropical fruit, bread and extremely resinous pine.

"Totally solid Double IPA. The hop profile in this DIPA is fragrant and citrusy. Some pine notes but not too bitter as some IPAs can be. The color was much darker than the """pale""" as it listed. More of an amber orange color. The head was creamy and the color of manilla paper."
"This is a good strong brew. You get the full hop flavor without a strong bitterness. There is a slight bitterness, but it is well balanced."
"Drinkability – This is actually more drinkable than their standard IPA because it is better balanced. It’s not big but is certainly a double."

"Very light yellow in color for a dipa. Piney grapefruit taste but not too sticky as you might expect. 9%is totally hidden for me. This a pretty unique beer in appearance and taste.

Its funny this beer to me is Heady Topper's younger, skinner, quieter brother. Not as cool but still fun to hang with. I enjoy this beer right down to the bottle and the label. I will def have this beer again."
"Overall: I really wish I could get this one more often. I am very glad to have had it. I am glad that I had to travel to Denver to get this one. I suspect that shipment to Utah and travel in the Utah system would age this beer, especially during a hot summer."
"to revisit it."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very interesting beer, but it was a bit different than I expected. It's remarkably different than Odell IPA (or what I imagined an imperialized version would be like). It's remarkably malty, and the hop profile has more of a range. This is definitely worth a try."
""
"pours a very average looking slightly cloudy honey color, with a big fluffy white head that dies back pretty quick. smells awesome, a huge citrus hop aromatic palate, ive got grapefruit rind, orange juice, fresh lemons, and that classic resiny hop bitter/sweet combo. maybe even a subtle english malt or two underheath. flavor is nice, not as robust and interesting as the nose, but solid. its bitg and strong and hoppy without being sweet, which is welcomed here. this does justice to the hop flower, i like that its still kind of delicate. feel is nice as well, again not thick and syrupy like some big india pales can be. not overly carbonated, and a nice hoppy finish. hard to imagine its over 9% abv. feels sessionable to me. overall its a nice beer, but the bang for your buck is in the regular ipa from odell, which is over 7% and is superior to this in a lot of ways. odell though, can do no wrong in my eyes."

"Pours a crisp golden with a full white head, bubbles continually rising to surface and decent lacing. Aroma is fruity (good dose of peaches, citrus and its rind), oily, and a touch toasty. Flavor followed suit. A creamy, medium bodied active mouthfeel. Overall, fantastic beer. My favorite IIPA."

"overall, this started out really good, but then took a bad turn. still a decent offering, but with so many great easily attainable DIPAs out there, i wouldnt seek this out again."
""
"I actually liked this more than it sounds, but it's not top tier. A decent hoppy beer with some odd flavors. Not a favorite, but drinkable on occasion."
""
"Taste is bright and the hops are very interesting...total opposite of piney and resinous hop flavors. These are tropical, bubblegummy almost. Lots of alcohol and the malts give off a sweet vibe, but are very light and really just get out of the way and let the hops do their thing. Pretty good, I like it."

"Citrus fruit hops up front. Juicy, bitter, and tasty. Orange marmalade, pineapple, and lemon make their mark, before the complex hop profile reveals some resinous, weedy, and even piny notes. Sugary fruit and cookie dough malt makes an appearance, but definitely takes a backseat to the hops. Medium-full body, with an almost oily feel. Tasty!"

"I liked it, but its not the kind of beer I would pop open to get me my vegetal hop fix."
""
"Overall, an excellent ADIPA and one of my favorites from Odell. Really wish they'd distribute here in TX. Used to get from a buddy in Denver but he moved so haven't had any in awhile. Picked up this 6 pack in Joplin, Mo while driving back from Indy. Highly recommend! Rotation - would be in heavy hop rotation if avail near me [H;Y]"
""
"O: I really wish this beer would hide the booze a bit better. I'm not overly impressed with this brew."
""
""

"O - Very fine. It was interesting to compare it side-by-side to the Odell IPA and a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (as a benchmark). I liked this one the best. I rate it just a shade below my favorite DIPAs but would love to have a glass of this anytime, anywhere."
"Overall: If you can get a fresh bottle then pick it up! It seems like forever since I've had a fresh bottle. If the best by date is within the next two months this one isn't fresh enough imo. You need at least 2 1/2 months before the freshness date to get the aroma from the dry hopping."

"Tasted earlier in 2011 and I liked it a lot. This bottle is dated 9/1/11. I guess this puts me over 2000 on the BA scale, and thanks for all the fun tasting and reviewing."
"This is a nice dipa. I love the juicy fruit flavors and the non-bashful booziness. This guy separates itself from the rest with a nice nose/flavor profile, which makes this a winner in my book."

"All in all, this is a very solid double IPA. I wish it was a tad cheaper, but bigger beers require more ingredients, so the cost will be reflected in some way. It's highly drinkable compared to many of it's peers due to it's lighter weight, that is if you have already been conditioned to hoppy beers"

"O: Not my definition of an amazing, or even hit the spot refreshing, IPA. But atypical and better than average I suppose."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a badass DIPA from one of the greatest beer states. The hops offer some really nice hop scents and flavors and is all around a great brew."
""
"In a word, excellent. Tons of fruity aromatic hops. I particularly like the restrained use of bittering hops - despite the intense aroma the bitterness is relatively mild. A top-notch brew; I'd love to have this again."
""
"O: 2 thumbs up for Odells on this one."
""
"O - WOW! Definately full of flavor! You get what you pay for here and then some!"
""
"O: A great DIPA that I just might make a go-to. After living in Colorado for six months, I can't believe it took me this long to try."
""
""
"M - Extremely easy to drink. Not cloying and not overly bitter. Perfect balance of hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Good stuff."

"Overall: As expected, another quality brew from Odell. Great respect for this brewery. Main reason for 'Overall' rating is a slight negative reaction to the hop profile (floral and bittering). Admittedly, I'm used to PacNW Imperials with local hop strains dominating. Makes me even more curious about the hops used in this brew. Thanks Odell, this is my first BA post. Happy to be among good company."

"O - another solid beer from Colorado again. Odell seems to contribute to that list quite a bit. Definitely a beer I will be drinking again. It would be tough to see this on tap and not go for it."
""
""
"O. Excellent Dipa, always on my wants"
""
"O: Oh my, a very tasty one. I could see myself drinking this quite often if it were available locally. Never got such a clear pineapple flavor from an IPA before-- this is really good."

"Thanks to emerge077 for this one."

"O - This is my all-around favorite beer, considering it's not prohibitively expensive. Imperial stouts are great too - but this beer is so enjoyable, delicious, and refreshing, that it is hard to match. Haven't had some of the more notorious DIPA's (pliney, hopslam, citra etc) but I will try to seek them out for comparison. I can only hope they are as good as this."

"O: A good DIPA, though more dry and bitter than I remember it being. The sweet floral tropical fruit character is there, though it is buried and I would prefer more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very strong DIPA from Colorado. This is a very easy drinking imperial IPA with an amazing balance of sweetness, bitterness and citrusness (I dont think thats a real word yet). Im very impressed with this beer and wish it was available in California."
"This was certainly a nice treat for my tastebuds after the two other duds that I just had. I really like the juicy, hop fruitiness that is in this beer and it is made even better that this is supported by an almost rough, raw, herbaceous hop character. I wasn’t expecting this to be nearly so good, but damn am I enjoying this beer."
"Overall: I'm not sure why the smell was so mild. It smells good, but not enough. Overall I enjoyed this beer thoroughly and would have another."
"O- solid beer. I'd like to try it fresh, as my bottle has a couple months of age on it"
"O: A Great DIPA, very happy they have been making this one consistently."
"Bottle to snifter. Good lookin out fortsambo. Perfect almost florescent amber super clear. Smell is tropical punch warm yeasty sweet bread some Sharp spiced rum and faint peppery notes. Taste follows very bittersweet like a dipa should be. The pineapple grapefruit and resin are all there alcohol warm but I can't taste it until it warms. Yeast complexities shine through. Very similar to Troegs beers. Mouthfeel is excellent creammy with a mild oil covering the mouth. I will search for this again!"
"O - highly drinkable, I would def. purchase this again if I was anywhere near the distribution area."
"O - Unbelievably drinkable DIPA that would satisfy even the harshest of hop critics. At 9.3% this stuff drinks like water, drink with caution."
"O: I don’t usually like IPAs like this; you know, the rich malt-bombs like Southern Tier’s 2XIPA and FFF Apocalypse Cow. Myrcenary, though, is a balanced, drinkable version of that style manifestation. One of the best malt-forward IPAs I’ve ever had."
"The paths this beer takes are new to me and the dryness seems to be more welcome in the muskiest farmhouse ale or red wine. Despite my reservations, it's still quite original and I'm obviously in the minority when it comes to my unfavorable opinion."
"O: I have drunk some of the top DIPA's (Heady Topper, PtE) in the past week and I have to say this one isn't as great, but it's definitely on the same level. Awesome brew."
"Hazy golden with a pretty cream colored lumpy head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Dank, fruity hops with a mild hit of caramel malt in the nose. A beautiful hop-bomb, pine sap and grapefruit pithe with caramel slathered toast all in beautiful harmony. Medium bodied with a slick hoppy mouthfeel that finishes resinous and delicious. A fabulous beer."
"A light straw colored beer with a thin head. Definitely not a malt forward IPA. HUGE floral notes on the nose with some pine and boozy sweetness to it. Taste has great hop flavor and bite without becoming over the top bitter which makes for a double IPA with world class taste and drinkability. 9.3% ABV dangerously concealed and drinkable."
"Myrcenary is obviously based on Odell IPA: but with everything dialed up a few notches. The characteristic incredible smoothness for such a high ABV is here, as is the attention to appearance and aroma. Whereas IPA tastes more like an ESB, this double IPA comes off like a summer beer until passing over the back of the tongue and making it's true intention of an IPA known! All and all an excellent brew that I was happy to select for my birthday this year. I hope that the local grocery continue to carry it as it is great for special occasions."
"Tastes like it smells only, unfortunately, the malt nodes dip into syrupiness near the back end. The overall product is still very nice--aggressive but drinkable and balanced, but it's not the complete package the aroma had led me to hope for."
"Will definately try again!"
"4.0 D: Really good beer. Jam packed with flavor. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the breadiness. I don't care for that flavor in DIPAs, but this is so good that I have no trouble looking past that."
"Overall: An excellent DIPA--there is no way I could taste it at 9.3%--beautifully smooth with exceptional drinkability. A truly great beer."
"Poured in a rinsed glass at room temperature, I found this beer to have bold aroma and flavour that sprints across your pallet. The tropical citrus that Odell talks about also makes itself known on the nose, and with a crisp finish."
"O- A very tasty take on the style. The alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Memorable and recommend."
"Sweet candy-like floral, resinous and hoppy aroma. Appearance is modest, golden with slight translucency. Taste is extremely resinous, citrus fruit. Oily and long-lasting palate with a long finish. An extremely oily but delicious beer. Resinous to the max!"
"Really nice DIPA. I'd heard this compared with Pliny the Elder, but I wouldn't go that far. Maybe a bit maltier than I'd hoped, but still great."
"Body is light, yet still packs a punch. Not really an assault as much as I would have thought, but still very good. Balanced, sweet, and bitter."
"Overall this is a very clean and drinkable DIPA. Definitely recommended to any hophead or even the new BA looking to try a good DIPA. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a good double IPA that I am happy to have but it is not groundbreaking."
"O - hop mix makes this both unique and a winner, the alcohol complements the brew, a must for any hop head"
"This one pours a hazy, straw color with an off white head that sticks around. As soon as you pop the cap on this brew you can smell the hops. I love that buttery, citrus aroma. Each sip of Myrcenary is so smooth it almost hurts. The citrus flavor shines thru and marries oh so perfect with the bitter twang. It is amazing how that citrus flavor just hangs around. The alc. is lost in there which is great but it all works together for a velvet like finish. I love this beer. My 2 fav DIPA's are now both out of CO. This and 471 should be in my fridge at all time."
"Overall this is a good fix for the average hop head, but it was just simply not all that memorable."
"overall: one of the best dipas ive had, but not the best. didnt' get too much smells from it, but who cares when a beer tastes this good. very jealous i cant pick this up in wisconisn"
"Overall: An outstanding DIPA. It's every bit as good as Ruination, Double Jack, and Ale Mucho Hoppo (to name a few of my personal favorite DIPAs). This will go toward the top of my favorites list. I'll revisit this one very soon. A true hop-heads delight. I'd say its the best DIPA in """fly over country""" and will give any coastal, hop-forward DIPA or IPA a run for its money-- even the legendary Pliny. I'd also claim that this is better than Hopslam. A truly grand effort that requires commitment, love, and a real commitment to understanding its depth. A true beauty.-- 5"
"Overall: not too bad but still not the kid of DIPA I want."
"Taste - grapefruit and pineapple in a bottle! Great citrus taste without the bitter sour taste. Mouthfeel is thin to medium which is perfect for this offering. Overall this is an excellent DIPA."
"When I opened it I was instantly hit with a nice array of pineapple and crispy piny hops. It pours a light bodied very bright gold in color with a one finger white head. The flavors are a nice mix of pineapple, citrus, clean and light pine and a light honey malty sweetness. It's very, very good. I love IPAs that aren't loaded with caramel malts. The alcohol isn't very noticeable at all. This one is light bodied and very easy to drink. Very easy. It's just a nice combination of aroma, flavor, and drinkability. Very good beer and well worth the try."
"Overall - A strong player in the DIPA style. The hops, while plentiful, play in a more unique way than this beer’s peers. Holding back in the aroma and steering clear from that traditional hoppy bitterness, this hop profile is all about an acidic feel and fruity flavors. I feel there’s almost more bitterness from the yeast than the hops. I’m always a proponent of the bitter start/floral finish hophead IPAs, but this ‘Myrcenary’ upsets the status quo without apology, and with success."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit. No off-characters is always a strong point in any beer (unfortunately), and this beer does well on that front. Great lacing, full mouthfeel, and myrcene taste gives this beer strength on several fronts, making it pretty well rounded."
"Overall - An extremely good if maybe slightly unbalanced DIPA.... definitely recommended though..."
"Overall - An extremely good if maybe slightly unbalanced DIPA.... definitely recommended though..."
"When are they coming to East Coast? Wanna drink these beers a lot more often please!"
"What I enjoyed most about this great beer is the variety of hop flavors that made trickled their way through the senses. While the aroma was tropical fruit-forward, the flavor leaned more on the citrus/piney side while still keeping up the IIPA-level that is promised. Very drinkable, deliciously well made. Get this distributed in California!"
"O: A great DIPA for the fruit lovers. Surprisingly well balanced, not a bitter bomb but the tropical/citrus flavors are abundant everywhere."
"D - Very drinkable. The 9.3% abv is dangerously hidden here. I really like the hop profile from start to end as well as the hop malt balance, spot on."
"Poured the twelve ounce bottle into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. A strong white head about half an inch formed. The head stayed for a few minutes as I first sniffed the aroma I can smell citrus and what seems like pine, smells very nice. The color is a strong golden yellow. My first sip is a very nice citrus flavor followed by a mouth drying burst that makes me want to have another sip. For a high alcohol beer this is very easy to drink I didn't notice the alcohol in the flavor. Overall a very enjoyable drink I am looking forward to having the other three of my four pack."
"Overall: If I could drink this as my go-to DIPA, I would. It's got a ton of flavor and drinks like a champ."
"I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile, and it does not disappoint. I got a four pack in trade, so I still have 3 more to enjoy....yeah!"
"O: a great representation of the style, very smooth, a bit too aggressive to be highly drinkable but still very solid, refreshing, and crisp"
"O: Good easy drinking DIPA, my only real complaint is that it is overly sweet."
"A decent, malt-forward DIPA, but not one that I have any plans to revisit. That being said, this may have been an old bottle."
"Pours a light golden with a hint of orange. Quite light in appearance for an IPA (which I like). The head is small and off white in color. Smell is a tiny bit disappointing, a bit of cantaloupe and some pine. Taste is initially a wave of sugar cookie sweetness, followed by a little bit of candied lemon. A bit of ethanol is detectable here. It finishes with a quite herbal, grapefruit rind finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, low carbonation. Overall an amazing Double IPA, other than the slightly lackluster aroma and perceptible alcohol which bring it's score down a bit. I certainly plan on getting this again."
"O: As a general fan of the Colorado beer scene, I was very excited to try this beer upon first sight in my local liquor store. I bought a single bottle in a Mix-n-Match cooler and will definitely be looking to find it on tap and purchase it in packs in the future. Well worth the money if you like IPA's. Though other cheaper IPA's may satisfy most days of my drinking. Special, but not immediately drive to CO from MN to try on site awesome. Probably a 4.3 on a personal scale."
"Overall Impression- A Great brew but wanted more from it. Odell always has a nice brew and usually they are helping push diversity and complexity in each and every style. This one is easy to drink, has a very strong sweetness, and would recommend for those who enjoy IPAs. This one isn't that much more to take down. Enjoy!"
"Overall, a great, hoppy IPA."
"O= Got this as a extra glad I got this one it was a nicely done beer really enjoyed it."
"Thanks to Sweetwillyrolbar for sending this one!"
"O- A very nice clean crisp and refreshing DIPA. I really wish I could have this on a regular basis. Drinks so smooth and easy. Really recommend this beer to all, not just hopheads."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. Reminded me of Three Floyds Dreadnaught because of the extreme tropical fruit hop aroma and flavors; there are slightly more floral hops and alcohol present but still close. Definitely another great DIPA and another great offering from Odell. Would definitely readily consume if readily available. Currently being sold @ France44.com so I recommend an order if they ship to your state."
"O Excellent DIPA. Would definitely seek this out again. My bottle was about a month old so I would really like to try something a little more fresh."
"Awesome brew. So glad I traded for this. Hands down one of my top 5 favorite DIPA's. Very hoppy, full of alcohol and full of greatness. This brew most definitly needs to be sipped. even though it needs to be sipped the alcohol is deceiving. There is citrus and grapefruit tones throughout. Hops and alcohol hit first but the alcohol does not overwhelm here at all. Great brew and a must for any hop head out there. I want a 4-pack in my fridge at all times now."
"Overall: Another wonderful beer from the brewers at Odell; can't recall having a loser from them yet"
"Overall - Good, but A? No. A little rough around the edges. There are other local IPAs I'd drink before this."
"O - Overall, this is probably my second favorite DIPA after Pliny and I need to trade for some more soon! Seek this one out, you won't be disappointed. Well done, Odell."
"overall, I really liked this DIPA. I usually lean towards the types with more balance, and this one fits that bill perfectly. Nice hop notes, but nothing overpowering with some nice backbone. Im a big fan of this brew."
"Myrcenary pours a nearly opaque tangerine, with the color lightening towards yellow in the right light. The white foam tops out at only about two fingers tall. The head retention is well above average, but the lacing is just average. The nose is a tropical vacation, it's an absolute pineapple and mango bomb, with a bit of peach thrown in as well. There's just a light bit of candi sweetness in the flavor profile to keep things interesting, otherwise it's an all hops affair. Bitterness is enough to grab your atttention, but stops short of being aggressive. The close of each sip is exactly what the aroma promises, a full on tropical fruit assault. Mango has stepped up to tie with pineapple for the lead, with peaches pulling up the rear, and just a drop of citrus juice added into the profile. The body has a little more presence than I might have hoped for, a little more lightness would have done wonders. Carbonation is right in the comfort zone, bubbly and active, though it's a minor, minor quibble that it could be just a little more so. Myrcenary is a solidly above average imperial IPA, and I'm glad I picked up a whole four pack instead of just a bottle."
"O: This is a very nice Imperial IPA that is blends together excellently.. The 9% ABV is evident but married with the spiciness/resiny, slight sweetness and moderate hoppiness make it a glass you keep picking up and before you know it, the bottle is gone. If the spiciness/resin levels were reduced a bit, this would be an A+ knockout."
"O- A solid IIPA and one that is near the top of my list."
"o-Wonderful IIPA. There is so many good things going on with this beer. I can say that Odell knocked it out of the park with this beer."
"Overall: Highly recommended."
"O- No Abrasive here, but definitely one of the better DIPAs I've had. Very balanced and though hoppy, its not one dimensional or invasive."
"Tropical fruits are usually not something I even enjoy, but I love them in good drink. This is a great example right here. Fantastic double IPA here."
"Very unique and very tasty."
"Overall: It s a nice DIPA, but nothing mindblowing. It will still hold it own with the mainstream beers of this style. It is a solid beer."
"Poured a clear orange-golden with a small white head, that retained well nonetheless, and left some really crusty lacing. Scents of citrus and pine for the most part. Big hop kick on the tongue right off the bat, citrusy, resin, with a bit of malty sweetness coming in to mellow things out. Alcohol was moderately apparent. Medium-bodied, left a bit of film in the mouth, but still quite drinkable. Not as good as their regular IPA, I'd say."
"Overall, I'd put this on my top 3 shelf: Pliny, Hopslam, and now this Myrcenary. What a wonderful surprise. Get some if you can."
"all in all, this a solid double ipa well worth its rating and praise. The flavor profile - specifically the hops - don't completely blow my palate out of the water, but I can't knock it for that. all around impressive and one of the better IIPAs I've had recently."
"O- I've had three Odell beers (IPA and Red are the other two) and all are fantastic. Thanks to Titosupertramp for throwing this bottle my way."
"Thank you Chugalug06 for the great Double IPA; I'm starting to become an Odell fan."
"The mouthefeel is what makes this beer. The bottle carbonation hides the alcohol and makes it amazingly easy to drink."
"Even though this bottle was at least a couple months old, it still maintained much of it's fantastic hop character (though it was slightly subdued). This is truly a great DIPA, with juicy tropical hop flavors and relatively well concealed alcohol. Yum."
"poured from bottle into pub glass. This is one of my favorites, let me preface this before I continue. Besides the color (pale yellow with a tinge of orange), everything else is amazing. Great bitter citrus in the nose and taste. I love the taste of this beer, the bite from the alcohol is the only reason why I didnt grade it exceptional. If you call yourself a hop head and havent tried this beer before, then find a different term of endearment. Definitely a must try."
"HV"
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this. By no means a 'palate wrecker' of a DIPA, but there are plenty of those to choose from. I don't know if restrained is the right word to use, but this is an easy drinking double with a great combination of flavors."
"Very drinkable beer, nice."
"Just flat out delicious. I have no problem believing this one belongs among the best in the style."
"Wow. Phenomenal. Not much else to say."
"M- Medium bodied. Smooth and not much of a dry or bitter aftertaste. 9.3% is very well hidden. I could drink a few of these in a sitting very easily."
"Maybe not one of the great ones, but one of the most fun to drink."
"Bright golden color is a sight, and so is the tiny-bubbled lacing that wants to stick everywhere. Smells of grapefruit, strawberries, blond tobacco and spearmint with some fruity alcoholic esters. Needless to say, the nose alerts us that copious amounts of hops were used to achieve such an amazing aroma. Just enough malt to lift this beer up, the body is a bit chewy and has some depth. Big smack of juiciness from the alcohol and hops; soon after, the hops break off and explode with bitterness and a flavor of grapefruit rind that does not seem to go away. Small nugget of malt flavor in the middle. As the bitterness levels out, the alcohol comes back around with its warmth. Juicy with a semidry finish. Epic in its own way, it’s a sipper, but one that will grow on you if you are a true hophead."
"Wow, if this is how good this beer is with several months on it, I shudder to think how this would be fresh in the bottle, much less on draft! This was flavorful and bitter with hop flavors, yet was still nicely balanced and approachable. This was definitely one of the better high alcohol DIPAs that I’ve had lately and did I mention that this was already several months old?! This one’s a sleeper for sure but I seriously doubt that it will be next winter when it’s rereleased."
"O: Really good. One of the more drinkable DIPAs out there. Reminds me a little bit like Abrasive, but not quite on the same level."
"Conclusion: If one cuts down a healthy Ponderosa pine tree, a wonderfully sweet piney sap will ooze from the wood. This beer comes the closest to that sap of anything I have tasted, and as odd as it might sound, that is a huge achievement. This is my favorite DIPA I have tasted so far, and it deserves to be counted 11th best overall 'new beer' on BA right now."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is just under medium bodied, and the carbonation is moderate and a bit prickly. Overall, I did not expect to be this impressed. This is a phenomenal DIPA that I would love to drink regularly. Definitely recommended."
"A nice, even DIPA, the booze well integrated, and thus easy enough to sip away whilst demolishing a nice pizza pie."
"Overall a delicious DIPA that covers all bases oh so well. Highly recommended and if there was an option to choose 4.75 in a number of areas, i would've gone close to wearing it out. Very impressive!"
"O: overall this beer kicks ass almost perfect what more needs to be said? Get this beer trade for it if you cant buy it."
"Overall-Would take this beer over Pliny instantly, enough said."
"O - No complaints from me here."
"Overall: This hit and exceeded my expectations. I think this is an exceptionally crafted beer and deserves any and all praise it receives. I would love to be able to get this regularly."
"O: I think this is a very refreshing brew. However, at 9% I would have to pull myself from a session of this brew. It wouldn't be that hard to get a pack down, but I'm sure it would take its toll. This is all to the credit of the brew, as I find this to be just a very cooling and revitalizing. My taste buds are wide awake, and I'm getting the most refreshing garden greens followed by thirst quenching fruits. Crazy delicious, but watch that ABV -- you'd swear it's a misprint."
"O: I didn't expect this beer to be this good. This is really tastey and probably the best execution of a tropical-fruit concentrated DIPA I've ever had. Odell definitely has my attention after this. If you're a lover of DIPAs, I think you will be surprised by this beer and find it ranking highly both for overall quality and for uniqueness of flavor. Great drink!"
"Cracking IIPA. Could happily do the whole 4-pack in one evening. Delicious array of hop character and a flavour profile that isn't massacred by an overbearing bitterness, as with plenty of other IIPAs."
"D/O- Reminded me a lot of Abrasive, which is a good thing (duh). A clear cut top-tier in a crowded field...a winner from Odell."
"O - Good beer, I didn't love it as much as I thought I would, but it's solid, and I got it down easily enough."
"Overall: I found this to be a good, although somewhat typical tropical DIPA."
"Overall- A tasty brew indeed. I will be putting this in to my regular rotation. In this price range I dont know if it gets much better for the style. A very drinkable DIPA that you can sit down and have more then one of at a time."
"Great introduction to Odell's and not sure why this one doesn't recieve as much hype as others do. It's right there with Hopslam IMO."
"Medium bodied, juicy, full, and nary a hint of the near 10 percent this supposedly packs. As I drank this I turned to wife and said that it had been a while since an beer stopped me in my tracks so unexpectedly. A very well done and delicious beer that I am happy to have grabbed some bottles of."
"D/O: An enjoyable combination of qualities make this a remarkable DIPA that is, without a doubt, the best of the style that I have encountered outside of California and Oregon. It is all about the hops here, and this beer is able to channel a fairly focused West Coast bouquet. Look for flavors that can't quite live up to the dazzling early hop nose."
"It's great to see a Colorado brewery come out with a beer like this that so closely resembles the great west coast IPAs I've been enjoying out here for so long. This truly is a masterpiece."
"Overall: This is certainly one of my top five beers. Out-fricking-standing. I like it a lot."
"Cheers!"
"The slick thick feel has a nice chewiness to it. The carbonation is light and unobtrusive, yet the bite is appropriate. The most interesting part of this one is the body. This is a solid well-rounded beer. It may not have the adolescent attitude like it's double IPA counterparts but perhaps it's just grown up a bit."
"Almost as good as Double Ninja, almost. Pretty awesome in it's own right however. When judged objectively on it's own merits and not against other beers, it stands out as unique."
"This beer pours with an un-assuming head and soft golden color, lighter than what I was expecting for a double IPA. But the aroma makes up for it, the aroma is huge and hoppy wonderful. And it gets better when you take the first sip. A big malt flavor greets you and slides right into lots of hoppy overtones and undertones. It’s a great ride, really flavorful and complex, with no bitter or bite. You really have to try this IPA for an experience beyond what you though an IPA could be."
"Just perfect."
"Overall a good DIPA, nice malty backbone, layers upon layers of hop complexity with a nice earthy chewy hop backbone and malt base. A bit a booze, and heavy bitterness (esp on the finish), and sticky finish make it tough to drink, but tasty, anything more than a 12oz would be very hard to finish."
"Overally: This is my first review ever and I have never felt inclined to review a beer before. But this has definitely become my favorite beer of all time. Due to its accessibility and price, you cannot go wrong. I have had both Pliny's and other highly rated IPA's/DIPA's...this takes it for me. Everything aboiut this beer is phenominal and I hope it gets it's recognition. Congrats Odell on your creation."
"Overall: good"
"O-- Great mix of the classic DIPA flavors, mixed with the new tropical flavors that are seeing more and more of. One of the best Odell beers to date. Well hidden ABV and easily have two in a sitting."
"O - i haven't heard a lot about this brew ive seen it in one of the ba mags and a little talk here and there but this is completely underrated as far as hype, i can't get over how good this was and such a pleasant surprise well done odell and ISO: myrcenary"
"O: first off, this is an awesome extra! Secondly, I must say that I put this right up there with my favorite DIPAs: Pliny, Hopslam, Maharaja, Double Jack, etc. Great brew from a solid brewery!"
"This beer is a delight to drink. It has been a long time since such a complex DIPA has graced my palate. I could enjoy this beer everyday I feel. Fresh is best!"
"O (D) - a big beer, very delicious, very well balanced. Not a punch-you-in-the-tongue sort of IIPA, but it's very good. Glad to have another bottle in the fridge...not sure if I'll be able to bring myself to share it."
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a good balance of bitter dry earthy hops up front that are countered by sweet citrus/tropical fruit.   Lots of citrus fruit especially orange peel and grapefruit, mango, pinepalle and papaya.  Slight alcohol heat toward the finish.  "
"Seemed a bit darker pour than on tap, like a light orange a bit hazy. Aroma had more grapefruit and sweet bread. I thought the feel was 'thicker' and not as light as the tap version; and provided some syrupy-ness in the end feel. The hops don't disappoint at all, with more citrus than grass or pine. Grain bill is strong and provides substantial backbone."
"O: Dee-freaking-licious. One of the best IIPA's I've had and one that I would enjoy having again and again. This is really a double-edged sword in that I am extremely glad I was able to try it but sad that I don't have direct access to it. This is one I would enjoy frequently but for now, I'll just enjoy the rest of this glass."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a trace of white foamy head that dissipates fairly quick and doesn't leave much lacing. The aroma is fantastic... Lots of different hops and just a hint of malty sweetness. The taste starts sweet with caramel notes and then becomes hoppy bitter. The mouthfeel is slightly lacking, but finishes clean. Overall a pretty good double IPA."
"O: Solid. I liked this and would buy a lot more of it if I had access to it."
"OH MY LORD! This beer literally kicked my tits in! Amazing smell that punches you in the face and leaves you wanting and needing more. Lots and lots of citrus and pine, lots of fruit. The flavor is much like the smell, in your face but instead of being 11 on the amp its just 10. the balance between the malt and hop bitterness is amazing, talk about well balanced for the 9% it has...the finish is so abrupt and dry that I couldn't put it down. This brew went a little too quick. Just watch out, Odell's did an amazing job hiding the alcohol in this one, you can literally go from a Sunday sit down taster to a tits out Friday night banger if your not careful. Honestly I was never a real fan of IPA's till this was dropped in Boise, like I said I was blow away and left wanting more, a great brew."
"Nose carries through onto the palate (suprise), waves of fresh tasting hops, tropical fruits, resins, sweet pinapple, hop lovers delight. Savored every sip of this one, very tasty and well crafted DIPA. How I wish this was distributed to my area...it would be one of my go to brews"
"Had this at a huge IPA tasting and this blew us away. Nobody had ever tasted it before so we were very surprised. At a tasting with Elder, Sculpin, Furious, Duet, Pure Hoppiness etc...this was the talk of the party! Thanks inlimbo77 for sharing!"
"Had this on tap at FRTH. This one followed up an elder on tap on my recent visit. Smell was outrageous. My friend, who was sitting nearby asked if I had just got a glass of weed. It is that potent. Tons of hops on the nose and in the taste as well. Real slick mouthfeel with tons of grassy hop flavor. Just a hop lovers dream. Picked up a 4 pack as well and it was well worth it! Good work!"
"O- Pleasantly unexpected but tasty and drinkable beer. With so many DIPA's out there it's hard to find new ones that impress, and Myrcenary does not disappoint."
"On both the aroma and palate this has so little malt bill leaving it dry and clean letting the hops show through in detail. this is how a proper ipa should be. There is a pleasent amount of tropical hops only overcome by some wet grass and flowery esters and even more light fruits such as pears and crisp red apples. A great hop combo that is an excellent summer ipa."
"O - Slightly above average. A little too watery for me on the mouth. The real killer here is the finish, just terrible even though the rest of the taste is good. No more for me, thanks. Can't recommend."
"Overall one of the better DIPA's to hit the market in recent times. If it were a few years back this would be top 25 material, but there is just so much competition nowadays, though I guess that's a good thing. I can't believe how drinkable this beer is, it really goes down like a single IPA. As long as this is fresh and readily available I will be buying some more..."
"Best DIPA I've ever had. I will get this every time I see it on tap."
"PP (Price Point) - Wife purchased the four pack for me, unsure at this time, guessing it was. (UNKNOWN("
"Thanks given2flybrewing and bbehr!"
"A really nice DIPA from Odell. Very affordable as a singel as well."
"O ~ Glad I was able to snag some from a friend traveling north bound from St. Louis... I could drink this one again, but would have to space them out over a couple of nights... Too many in one could kill my palate for awhile!"
"Overall -- There has been a lot of ballyhoo about this beer, and after this bottle I don't think I'm a believer. While definitely good, I don't think it lives up to the accolades. That said, it's a solid, go-to regional DIPA."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink considering its strength and doesn’t have any hints of alcohol in the taste."
"O- I wish I would have purchased this beer sooner. Another great brew from Odell. This is the 2nd best IIPA that I have ever had. I will be getting more. And for $10/4 pack, it is very reasonable. Do yourself a favor and get some."
"Mouthfeel - smooth, balanced, refreshing. nice on my sore throat. tingly."
"The Reveal: Odell Brewing The Myrcennary. This is indeed a well done fix of hops. Thanks again Phelps!"
"Overall a great beer, heck of a deal too for ten bucks a four pack."
"I liked this IIPA. Although it shows a little bit of heat, it isn't too boozy. The ratio of hop to malt flavor is skewed drastically toward the hops, which should make hopheads happy."
"Overall this is certainly in the top tier of DIPAs, a very clean, crisp, and smooth beer for the style that doesn’t really have any flaws. Well worth a shot."
"O: Pretty solid IPA. Nice hoppiness and not really sweet at all."
"D - As a year-round DIPA it's a solid offering. Reminds me a bit of Dogfish 90 Minute, but not as good. I'm sure freshness plays a big part in this beer's appeal, so make sure you know the bottle dates before trading for this one. Not overly difficult to drink, but there are far superior DIPAs in my own market - now if only Dreadnaught came in 4-packs..."
"Thanks to Chris for this, drank from a Hill Farmstead glass... pours an ugly dark straw, watery head... resin oil nose with some tropical fruits, a bit of mango, car piss, too harsh for me... not a fan of the taste, lemon zest, skunky pine, sweet finish... not a fan"
"Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a light orange color, completely transparent beer, visible small carbonation bubbles. Nice thick cloudy foam fills the glass, recedes slowly, leaving a ton of sticky lacing. Smell- citrus hops, grapefruit, bitter pine. Wow! This one is super floral. Taste- big biting hops up front, pine, followed by a sweet buttery malt flavor, finished by a nice bitter grapefruit finish. Awesome carbonation, perfect bodied Imperial IPA. I'm enamored with Odell right now...just perfection for the style."
"O- Very solid brew. I really enjoyed this one, i have it in my fridge as a regular visitor."
"O - one of the better dub/imp ipa's out there."
"O: Very nice double IPA. Nice surprise."
"O'Dell has heralded Spring with a suite of new and appetizing beers, all with a perceptible bow to the fragrances and flowers of a Colorado Spring. Although our state is beleaguered by capricious weather, most especially in March, April and May, O'Dell suffers from no such inconsistencies. Their Spring line-up has been excellent through and through, beginning with the very vernal Myrcenary. This beautiful example of an IPA pours out with a pure white head, and the body exhibits moderate clarity the color of apple juice. Hops, a bucolic whiff of farm soil, a graceful note of pineapple and the yeastiness of a freshly toasted English muffin are complemented by the thick, battery sweetness of pancake batter, all in an evanescent and airy stream. The flavor is, simply put, a light, well balanced IPA with a fresh and brilliantly added squeeze of lemon flavor. Most reviewers reported a significant taste of pine, but I never tasted anything remotely that dark or oozing. Rather, I detect a collection of light citrus flavors with mild hops and bitterness. The Mycenary has enough astringency to bill itself a refreshing summer beer, but never enough to make my taste buds recoil, and the light and bright flavors of fresh lemons impeccably blended with the hops' astringency are a completely unique approach to a Spring season and its accompanying palate."
"Easy-to-drink, but a little too 'middle of the road', I think. A bit too hoppy for those that don't like hops, yet not really hoppy enough for those that really crave them."
"Pours a dark orange with lighter edges. The head is super creamy and white. Great retention and great lacing. The nose is mostly hops- citrus, pine, and earth. Just a touch of honey. The taste had me saying """Bam!""" in my brain. All grapefruit and honey. Maybe a bit of earth but this is hop forward and the perfect amount of maltiness to attempt a balance. Full mouthfeel and medium carbonation. F-ing wonderful. Hype withstood."
"I find Myrcenary to be an enjoyable, interesting take on the style without being over-the-top."
"While drinking a bottle of Hellhound with a BA I met at a local bar, he brought this beer up as a beer that rivals Pliny. At the time I hadn’t had either, but today having recently had them both I can safely say this beer certainly has the hops to get a hop head to consider it. BTW this beer vanished from my glass before this review was complete. That really rarely happens."
"Note: I reviewed this after having it fairly fresh and am just now posting it."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, pine, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, pine, sweet malt, alcohol, slight wood, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, body, and blend. Another very good offering from Odell."
"Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head. On the light side of IPA's... which I'm optimistic about as I like the less malty IPAs. Smell is very fruity... grapefruit, orange, and mango, very nice. Taste follows, big fruity citrus hops, followed by some sweetness and finishes bitter. Very solid IPA flavor. Mouthfeel is decent, a little thin and finishes a little bit sticky. Overall this beer impressed me. It reminded me a little bit of Hopslam, but not quite as good. I would gladly drink a lot more of these though."
"Pale gold in color, with a finger and a half head of thick foam that leaves behind nice lacing. The upfront smell is grapefruit, with floral and citrus low notes. There's a bitter kick in the face with the first sip, followed by citrus and a *hint* of alcohol warmth, and the mouthfeel for this beer is actually rather full making it an extremely enjoyable IIPA. I love hops, so I love this beer, and would definitely pick it up again some time in the future."
"Overall- This is a good beer. I have reason to believe that the bottles I got were about 3-4 weeks old. Make me wonder how great this beer is when fresh. 4.5/5"
"O- Very solid brew. I really enjoyed this one."
"Uninterested in giving a full review at this point, just a first thought kind of rendering. I must say that I didn't know what to expect; ODell is so up and down. First thought is that this may be the best beer made in CO today.Def not ever. But today?... quite possibly. Closest thing to pliny and that supreme grapefruity, hoppy delicious taste this side of the continental divide. hope this isnt just a good batch, and becomes something consistent, and consistently available. time will tell if this beer is in line with my first take."
"Overall. Really nice, well-rounded dipa. Seems to have all the typically found flavours in the style covered which is kind of unusual. Just a little boozy, but not very distracting."
"O: Overall this is one fine DIPA. I have had this a few times in the past but this is the first time reviewing it. It is permanently on my wants list. Goes down super smooth. I think I could drink this all day and find myself in a lot of trouble!"
"This is a pretty good DIPA, but not what I expected. Like I said before, this one stick out in a sea of DIPAs. I'm just not sure its deserving of the high A's that it has."
"O: A good DIPA with a different flavor profile than I am used to. Nice aroma, but the flavors can be hit or miss, tropical and earthy can be a bit of an odd combination that sort of works, sort of doesn't."
"It’s been a long day. Let’s hope that this beer hits the spot. I had this when it was on tap at Old Chicago for the St. Patrick’s mini tour. Odell has since then started distributing it in 4 packs. I jumped at the chance to taste it again when I found it on the shelf a few weeks ago. Pours a hazy golden color, with a small frothy head. The nose is an eruption of hop character. Orange citrus shines through, followed by pineapple, with resinous pine underneath. This is a hop head’s wet dream. Citrusy pineapple hops start, and grassy malt sweetness finishes. There’s a beautifully understated bitterness level that’s soft, velvety, and smooth. The malt profile has kind of a honey-almond quality. It’s just there to keep the hops in balance. I think it could stand to be a bit bigger, but Mycenary aims for quaffability, and in that respect it succeeds. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation level gets out of the way. For a beer that packs 9.3% ABV, this is dangerously drinkable, as the hop bitterness and solid malt profile hide the alcohol. Too often double IPAs come across as too harsh. That’s not the case with this beer, as it’s well rounded and quite enjoyable to drink (again, think quaffable), despite the monster levels of both bitterness and ABV. A very effective hop delivery vehicle."
"Strong malt caramel body with juicy citrus and leafy hops in the finish. No alcohol burn, but a mild booze presence on the back of the throat. A nice DIPA, but a little too much booze and not enough hops."
"Thanks forgetfu for this one and i hope normyk enjoys receiving it in the rules BIF (yup... This is a hidden hint... I wonder if anyone will see it)"
"O: I'm a big fan of Odell and very excited for this, but was let down. This doesn't shake a stick at pliny or sculpin, the hops are no where near as distinct. I can't put my finger on it but I had a hard time getting through 12oz let alone a pint."
"Overall, a good DIPA that I am very happy to have year round. This is a great addition to O'Dell's lineup and I only question why it took so long to make its way there."
"-CHEERS!"
"Overall, this is a great DIPA. A great extra from SalukiAlum. Thanks for this one."
"Poured into a pint glass. Translucent gold with a reddish tinge. Bright white head formed on surface. Lovely bright hoppy smell upon pouring. At first, strong American hops shine through, but leave very little bitter aftertaste. Highly drinkable. I'd want a bit more of a lingering hops taste. Overall, a great beer."
"Overall:This a very tasty sweet IIPA full of sweetness."
"Medium mouthfeel and the obvious oily hop presence. No substantial notice of the alcohol adds to the drinkability. A liitle sweet overall for a DIPA for my tastes, but still a very solid offering."
"Overall- Incredibly assertive hoppiness in this beer. Aggressive. Sticky. Mouthcoating madness. I like it. A lot. The sulfur notes take a bit away from it, but not enough to make a fuss. The finish is really incredible in this beer. Will definitely seek out more!"
"I do not appreciate hop candy beers. Odell has not impressed me after trying their 90 shillings and Red ale also."
"I wasn't expecting this brew to be as good as it was, but for anyone who likes big IIPAs, it is definetely worth the taste."
"The beer is well carbonated and the alcohol is well hidden. I think my favorite abv for a double IPA is 8%, anytime a beer goes over 9 the alcohol sweetness just slightly intrudes on all the hops I crave. This is a really good double IPA, not on par with Pliny, Abner or Heady Topper but very close. Glad I got to try it."
"I'm glad this hop juice is available to me."
"O: I enjoyed Myrcenary. I've had better but I'm glad Odell put this into their regular rotation. A very good DIPA I could see being a stable in my fridge."
"o-I can say that this beer will not let a DIPA lover down. It starts out well and keeps my intrest through the serving. I think this rivials the Pliny's in all fields. Odell's hit it out of the park with this beer, glad it will be around all year. This is the biggest beer from Odell's offered in a 12oz format."
"BRAVO ODELL!"
"D- this is a pretty intense beer, even for a bigger style like DIPA. glad i got the chance to try this. ill look for some more if i find myself in an area of distribution."
"O - Absolutely love this beer. Probably my favorite IPA"
"This beer pours a dark honey golden with a hint of orange with a half inch of head that leaves lacing down the glass. The aroma is a very strong tropical fruit, a bit of melon and a slight sweetness. The taste is sweet, massive tropical fruit, a sweet malty pastry undertone and a slightly bitter finish. This is a delicous hop forward tropical fruit DIPA. It drinks quite smooth for 9.3% ABV."
"O: I like this a lot. It's among the best American IIPA's I've yet to try. I have a feeling that like a lot of similar beers, this is definitely one that is going to lose a lot of its panache the longer it sits on the shelf. Get one of these NOW! 4/5"
"O - This is a definite winner and worth checking out. I'm really enjoying this big beer from Odell - nice job!"
"Beer is medium in body, mildly sweet on the front with a nice grinding earthiness to the body that fills out on the end. Good finish with strong bitterness, overall a decent IPA. I'd like to try it on draft sometime."
"Pours a light golden color, crystal clear, with a pithy white head. Sticky lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Aromas are great, floral and citrusy, excellently hopped. Taste is smooth yet stiff, the big abv is masked well with a huge hop forward smack. Lots of resiny hop and dried apricot. A solid DIPA, send me more. Thanks to daniloknezic for the tasty extra."
"Medium body with a juicy, mouthcoating feel. I could drink a bunch of these - but I better not at 9.3% abv. A standout amongst the burgeoning crowd of dipas popping up almost daily it seems."
"Of all the breweries I visited in CO this month, Odell was my favorite and this is an amazing beer to reinforce how cool the brewery and its beers really are."
"(12oz bottle). Pours hazy golden color with off-white head. There is some nice lacing and moderate carbonation. Aroma has citrus/grapefruit, some pine and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste has a nice sweet malt and a balanced hop bitterness to it. Medium to full bodied with an oily texture. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. This is a very nice balanced beer and the abv is hidden well."
"D- Very nice DIPA. One of the better ones I've had. Like mine more hop heavy and this was right there. Big thanks to Blair for hooking me up with some Odell goodness."
"This is a wonderful citrus-forward IPA and stands up to most West Coast IPAs out there. Thrilled to have a regular supply of this one."
"On tap at The Happy Gnome in St. Paul poured into a pint glass. Pours yellow/golden with a white head. Very light color for an DIPA. The aroma has lots of tropical fruits, juicy orange, pine and a ton of floral traits. Behind it is sweet maltiness with minimal toast and a cotton candy taste. Medium body with fairly soft carbonation. The taste starts of with an oily hoppiness that’s drier than the aroma with mango, floral and spicy traits and the malt presence is less prevalent than on the aroma. There is also a cracker taste to it. The finish is quite resiny and clean. This hides the alcohol very well and is dangerously drinkable. Quickly became my favorite Odell brews next to the IPA."
"Poured a golden-sorta amber color from a 12 oz bottle into that damn shaker glass again. Nice creamy head and nice lacing that is still present nearly 15 minutes after the pour. Aroma is fruity/citrusy--lemon and orange?? Taste is where this one shine: malt, citrus fruits (definitely orange this time), and a little hop bitterness at the end. Althought DIPA are not my fav, this one is very quaffable. Some say a PtE killer; not sure but since PtE is kinda so -so to me..."
"Mouthfeel has a full, creamy body. This is very filling. It's one of those beers that is a One-and-Done. I'm done for the night after one of these."
"single bottle from the Boulder Liquor Mart"
"An excellent DIPA, enjoyable in every way, yet would not stand out in a DIPA field rich with excellent brews. In other words, we're spoiled."
"Flavor profiles carry over to a big grapefruit to pine finish."
"O: I really can't say anything bad about this beer. Except it's not yet in WA state. Luckily, I know a place..."
"A darn good beer. The smell and the taste don't quite line up, but they're both quite nice. This is 9.3% alcohol? Could've fooled me. Definitely in the upper tier of DIPAs I've had."
"The beer is clear and yellow, with a quarter inch or so of white head. The aroma is really pleasant, with a nice bouquet of floral, hop, and subtle citrus notes. The taste is very nice, with an impressively dry, hoppy finish. Medium bodied, the beer sits nicely on the palate. Alcohol content is impressively well hidden. I'd certainly have this again."
"Overall this was a really fine beer for sure. I enjoyed every last sip of this sticky resin filled taste. I would have to highly recommend this one to anyone out there that really loves the hops, this will not disappoint."
"D-very drinkable, hides the alcohol very well. some balance, hop forward and clean finish."
"Really well done, hope to enjoy another soon."
"Odell's needs to start distributing to California. I was lucky to receive a sample box of a lot of their brews from LSUPT, but once they're gone, I'll definitely need to hunt down some more."
"Again overall I thought this to be okay. Hopefully I just got a bad bottle."
"I just tried the Odell IPA for the first time, and the Myrcenary is very similar but even better. WOW. This is an impressive beer out of a bottle."
"Pours a slightly hazy, pale amber with a thin white soapy head. Decent lacing. Aroma is filled with tons of grapefruit, orange rind, and floral hops. Slightly grainy/malty aromas in there as well, but mostly hop-forward. Flavor is filled with the same citrus fruit hoppy sweetness, bready malts, and finishes with a floral/earthy aromatic hop presence. Bitter grassy notes in the finish as well. Creamy & silky on the palate and well carbonated. 9.3% abv only slightly noticeable as it goes down. Really impressed with this beer."
"Drinkability: Very flavorful and easy to drink. Quite a feat for Double IPA like this. The high ABV might make it one to session with cautiously, but it's definitely a beer that will leave you wanting another...and another..."
"Odell always keeps me interested with their brews and this one definately won me over, and quickly. One exceptional Dbl. IPA!"
"O – I had been wanting to try this since release information came out months ago. It’s the best DIPA from CO at the moment, IMO. Its now in my top 5 of favorite DIPAs, just exceptional."
"Thanks to mnbearsfan for the trade!"
"O- though i vacillate between the dark and light, the hoppy and the malty, if i was introducing someone to the IPA world (without scaring them off); i'd choose this one."
"Pours a bright, but slightly hazy, golden color with a matching head. Head is big and foamy and leaves lots of lacing. Smell really is top notch, almost every hop aroma you could imagine, tropical fruits and citrus are most pronounced though. Taste is fruitiness up front with some citrus and a touch of malt to round things out. I feel like this one focuses a bit more on hop flavor than bitterness. Medium bodied. I had high expectations for this one and it certainly did not disappoint."
"Overall this is a good beer, well balanced and flavorful. Nice beer, happy to see it in a four-pack!"
"OVERALL: My first sip of Odell’s beer was at about 1:30 in the morning at Illegal Pete’s near the University of Denver. It was the Red and I remember committing to finding more before I left town. Sure enough, I came across a couple bottle of the Myrcenary and the Odell did not let me down. I’ll be moving to Boulder in July and I imagine this’ll end up as one of my go-to beers. Colorado is going to be wonderful."
"The CPJ"
"Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 2.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"O: Highly drinkable. Smells good, tastes good. I really enjoyed Myrcenary...it's a must try for any fan of the style."
"O - Pretty good DIPA. Has some similarities to Founders Double Trouble and also to Odell's own IPA. Quite delicious brew."
"really good, alcohol is well hidden. drinks crazy easy and love the 12oz bottle. this is a winner."
"O: Flavorful and balanced for a big beer. Watch out for the ABV; it'll sneak up on you."
"Overall I believe this has held up to the hype. It is still very fresh, so I can't speak for this one in a few months, but right now I am very pleased. Even at $3 a 12oz. bottle I will pick up a fresh one of these every chance I get."
"This is delicious stuff. Hopefully odells keeps this one coming."
"614"
"O- Solid DIPA, really refreshing, excellent taste, aroma was very mild, overall really solid brew from Odell, very drinkable."
"Overall, a really solid dipa. I was really impressed with this one. Really drinkable. Probably the best I have had from Odell."
"Drink- A very good DIPA. I was suprised to see this one on tap. I was about to call a buddy to send a 4 pk. Not what I was expecting but was very taste non the less."
"O: Fantastic offering from Odell, I was very excited when I heard about this, and it did not disappoint. Another fantastic IPA from Odell. Really digging a lot of their new releases."
"D - solid DIPA here. One of the sweeter versions out there. I really enjoyed this guy and wouldn't hesitate to recommend or buy again. Surprise, another solid beer from Odell."
"O - Pretty decent DIPA. The smell is just great but it lacks in the taste. Understandable mouthfeel based on the ABV. I will try this again and based on the price, smell and mouthfeel, I think it is a bit better than Hopslam."
"O: a true Pliny killer.."
"The look, the smell, and the initial taste are glorious, hinting even at world clasas. But the close leaves a bit to be desired."
"Medium bodied, smooth, and creamy with low carbonation. I could drink this all the time. Since it is year round, I think I will. Odell IPA is one of my favorite IPAs. Myrcenary will no doubt become a favorite DIPA. Nicely done by Odell."
"All in all this does not showcase the flavors I expected and hoped for nearly as much as the regular IPA does. Worth trying but does not compare to Hopslam or Dreadnaught"
"D: Such a smooth, easy-to-drink DIPA; awesome beer, Odell!"
"Overall: I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer. As far ass IIPA's go, this one certainly stands out at me. the fact that it is very hop forward, without losing anything in the malt profile, while still remaining fresh and drinkable is a huge plus for me. Great job Odells, on another beer well executed!"
"O-I honestly was unaware of this beer until Curtis at Randall's Old Halls Ferry location pointed it out.He was spot on.A truly solid example of the style."
"I can't seem to find any excuse why I wouldn't buy more-- if I can find it."
"For an everyday, off-the-shelf DIPA, this is outrageously good. Outstanding, complex flavor mixes with an easygoing body to make a beer that's far more drinkable than its nearly 10 percent ABV would imply. The fact that it comes in affordable six packs instead of the pricy 750s Odell seems so fond of just adds ammo to Mycenary's clip. A winner, for sure."
"Pours a light yellow-gold with a smallish head that dissipates to a coating. There is some some lacing which lasts all the way through. The nose is a lemony citrus (pineapple, mango, orange) with some bready, floral and sweet undertones. Taste reveals a very sweet and thin DIPA, with orange, lemon, and pine as the dominant notes. The finish is only mildly bitter and dry and this is a little thinner than I would have expected (almost like a pilsner or pale ale). The mouthfeel is crisp, medium in body and carbonation. I liked this offering but it is not terribly complex and is a bit too thin for my preference. Still, it is a solid offering and one I would have again."
"O= Great DIPA! Worth checking out for sure. Not the most flavor in the profile but again worth checkin out."
"All 4's"
"O. Overall I am pretty impressed. I really like regular Odell IPA and Myrcenary delivers as well. Nice citrus and tropical fruit hop flavors. I like Odell's malt flavor in their IPAs. I think it lets the hops shine. Very glad this is going to be a year round release, just wish Odell's was distributed in Iowa."
"I could have tried this on my trip to Arizona but didn't know what it was when I saw it on a tap list. So I had a bottle here at home. Very nice DIPA, not super bitter. I should probably pick up a 4 pack."
"Some nice lace on this one. Smells like some top end sticky icky. Not too bitter...not too sweet, this beer is well balanced. The alcohol at over 9% is well hidden. A very session able beer and good news it will be a year round release. This is the good stuff as Julio would say."
"This beer pours a hazy orange color. The head is one inch of firm egg shell white foam that recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of mandarin orange, grapefruit, hibiscus, and a hint of pine. There is a lot of complex hop goodness going on in this aroma. The taste is a lot more citrusy than the aroma with the floral and pine elements hidden in the back ground. There is also a bit of heat during the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good DIPA, but I wouldn't quite call it great."
"Massive thanks goes out to Rake for this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a three finger bone white head that subsided to one very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grapefruit, citrus, and grapefruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, grapefruit, lime zest, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit hop, and hints of sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this beer wowed me in all aspects! The complexity of this one on the flavor was nothing short of insane and really surprised me once I started digging. The aroma was good but did nothing in the way to prepare your palate for what was to come. Also had a very nice bitter bite from the hops as well on this one. I saw this mentioned in a thread recently and HAD to crack it open, really glad I did. Definitely worth introducing this to your palate, trust me, they will become good friends."
"Odell, you have hit a home run! Keep this on as a seasonal or year rounder if feasible. I'm wishing I had bought more than a 4 pack of this. This was great on draft as well"
"This is a real nice drink. Two would be doable, but three might be an effort (richness, fullness, but not necessarily in flavor)."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Bottom line: get it. It's good beer."
"A terrific drinking DIPA from Odell. It's not huge but a definite contender amongst the best."
"O: This is one of the most well balanced IIPA, I have come by. The smooth and light character is well achieved with the high ABV and the flavors of the hops are fresh and some of the best hop profiles seen. I will seek this out to have on hand at all times. A top 10 best brews of all time for me."
"O- This is the best brew by O'dell's in my opinion. A great DIPA that is a good comparison with some of the best. Good Job."
"Extremely bitter, high ABV, does not promote consumption. Good for when you want a hop kick though."
"Bordering on full bodied with medium light carbonation, I like the mouth feel muchly and for a big bold beer, it drinks very easy. I think I prefer it on draught by a bit but in the bottle is also a welcome treat."
"Pour yields a peach-colored brew with a good white head with moderate retention. Good sticky lacing as it falls down the glass. The nose is really overpowering with an overload of tropical fruits, mostly mango with a bit of pineapple. Behind that, there's a touch of citrus. The flavor is along the same lines--no malt, just plenty of hop character. The flavor isn't as strong as the nose would suggest, though still quite nice. There's a decent amount of bitterness in the background, as well as a bit of alcohol to balance. Not too bitter; the hop flavor seems to be the showcase here. Overall, a very nice beer that I will gladly have again."
"Finish: Floral hops that have a little maltyness to it with a nice stickiness on the lips"
"Overall - a little too bitter for my taste, minus the expected powerful taste of hops. Still a good and interesting brew."
"O - This is a really good DIPA. Odell is on a hot streak of cranking out new great beers."
"Pours a sexy pale golden with slight haze, and thick creamy white meringue-like head. Nose is the expected tropical fruit delight, as well as floral delights in there too. Some herbal/grassy notes are present also. Palate is surprisingly tame, not a whollop in your face DIPA at all, just a smooth textured beer that is nicely balanced with the tropical fruity hops and candied malt. Not overly bitter. Very balanced, tasty, drinkable."
"Good amount of carbonation. Very smooth beer. A little hot as noted, but still very nice. All in all a very good beer. Not quite on par with pliney, hopslam and the like, but getting close."
"Notes: Myrcenary is a medium to full-bodied DIPA, with a creamy mouthfeel that stands up to the intensity of the hops. For what it lacks in aroma, the taste and the long finish make up for it. A very tasty example of this style, and very easy to drink. Well done, Odell!"
"Nose has tons of fruit, mango and peach like but also some citrus, fantastic. Head was soft, fluffy and retained for a good time. Poured somewhat pale in color and hazy. Lacing was present and pronounced throughout the glass. I was a bit concerned with the ABV being 9.3 but it is hardly noticeable. Tasted of more fruit and less citrus/grapefruit than the Odells IPA. The carbonation was on the lower side but it works very well. The taste and nose just kept growing on me as I drank it, quickly becoming a favorite."
"*edit* I had this again tonight. I stand strong in my review. Incredibly average for the style. Sub par poop. I would never buy this again."
"I like this overall, but I don't think it is quite top-tier. I think it is drinkable as hell, but I prefer the hop bitterness to stand out a little more in my DIPA's. This is a very good beer however and I am more than happy to be able to access this one year round."
"I had been looking forward to this one for awhile and it did not disappoint. Odell makes a nice IPA and it's no surprise that their new DIPA is a solid addition to their lineup. I can see myself picking this up on a regular basis."
"Overall: Another great beer from Odell and the second night in a row I have had a fantastic DIPA (the other was Central Waters Illumination)."
"D- tasty 2ipa very drinkable if you like floral tropical 2ipas this one is for you ..i will be buying this in the 4-pk when it hits minneapolis end of month"
"Great new release from Odell!"
"Definitely a great new beer from Odell!"
"Well done, O'Dell. I hope to find some here in St. Louis!"
"D: Its a ripper and a sipper. Rips the tongue in the right ways. Some people may find the tropical flavors not as abrasive as other DIPAs (pun intended). But I love the tropical flavors in IPAs and am so happy to see it make its way to a DIPA."
"Pours an orangish tan with a nice a nice beige head. Nose has a great belnd of floral hops and sweet malts. As does the taste. Really a great IPA. Dare I say Plinyesque? But it really is that good. Great resiny body. I love hops!"
"D - ABV is so well hidden but you feel it after a couple, definitely a smooth drinker. Awesome DIPA Odell nailed this one."
"Overall a really great DIPA and one worth seeking out. One of the best I've had."
"Solid double IPA, not my favorite hop profile, but nicely drinkable still and a well made beer."
"Excellent DIPA. One of the best around!"
"Overall I wasnt too impressed. I would like to try it again though under new circumstances"
"D - Easy drinking for a DIPA. ABV is strong, but well hidden. A little bit refilling. Very potent, palette coating."
"Draft. On tap at Old Chicago in Eden Prairie. Poured into a pilsner style 10oz glass a slightly cloudy orange amber color with a slight white head that leaves laces as it settles. Strong hop resin aroma in the nose with mostly citrus rind notes. Medium/heavy mouhfeel. Pretty sweet upfront but expected as a DIPA. Nice smooth citrus hop flavors. I get a lot of apricot out of this one in the flavor as well. Lingering bitterness. Abv is well hidden and this drinks incredibly well."
"Upon first sniff I thought it was the same as the regular IPA. It smells more hoppy though, especially after it warms up. Taste is very hoppy, sort of spicy hoppiness, I think I like the regular IPA much better. The mouthfeel on this is too syrupy for my tastes. If you are looking for a hop bomb this might fit the bill but the syrup aspect tells me I won't be buying this again. This is better than the double IPA I had from Odell at Falling Rocks 10th anniversary party several years ago."
"A+"
"Simply put; this is an excellent beer."
"Overall, a very solid DIPA. It's a completely unbalanced hop bomb, but a good one. It reminds me a little of Gubna with some balance to the Summit hops."
"D: This came across to me as a pretty standard DIPA. Nothing really stood out to me, but I enjoyed drinking it."
"Had this one on tap this afternoon at the Odell Brewery in Fort Collins. Pours a medium golden color with nary a head. Aromas of earthy hops, some pine and caramel. Light bodied and somewhat thin for the style, with flavors of earthy hops, pine and caramel malt."
"The aroma is grapefruit with slight hint of pine. The appearance is golden hazy. The flavor begins with a 2row malt taste followed quickly by citrus hop flavor and then the flavor rolls across the tongue with flavors of pine and resin. The finish is only slightly bitter which leaves you wanting more. A great beer and I understand the name comes from the brewer extracting the mycerene hop oils that are considered bad at boiling but Odell found a way to use those oils."
