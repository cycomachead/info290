My selection was based solely on the 9.1%abv (needed a high octane offering)  and that it was an Imperial IPA (my go to fav)!!!  That being said, I count this among my best """random""" picks ever!  True to form, the IIPA does not disappoint! Anyone that's read my rambling posts knows I am a true Stone convert, and as such, believe """Enjoy By", is the standard  from which all other IIPA's must be judged! Therefore, I am obligated to say Great Lakes """Lake Erie Monster""" stands tall! The 9.1% is well hidden and hop bang is sublimed so that you're not wrecking your palate (take note Green Flash), leaving you with an enjoyable experience from start to finish! Do yourself a favor and give this a try!","TheRougeBastard","Aug 17, 2014"

The aroma is delicious, light hops reminiscent of tropical fruit. The taste is equally flavorful, again with the same tropical notes but this time coupled with a hint of citrus and a nice malt backbone. It has a thinner body but it matches up well with the flavor profile. This is truly an outstanding IPA.","delta490","Jun 24, 2014"

Aromas of light pine, evergreen, citrus sweet and tart, cut grass, and subtle spicing. Solid, but not overpowering. Flavors are smooth and bold, with a solid dose of sweet caramel supporting a blend of tropical fruit and citrus sweet, with grassy and pine overlays. Very blended and balanced. Tangy sweetness with hints of bitterness fill the aftertaste, and the body is light and smooth throughout, with the carbonation providing a slight edge throughout. Damn tasty brew. The finish is smooth, slightly effervesced, and slightly dry, with a resinous linger. Solid, drinkable brew.","GarthDanielson","May 29, 2014"

The body is thick and sticky; almost too much so and I love sticky ipas. The flavor is overly sweet almost cloying. It is very fresh with an abundance of hops but the degree if sweetness interferes with how great of a beer this could be.

The blast of overly ripe tropical fruit is here, but there's also a very pronounced grape presence, which is good, but there's a lot of strange bitterness hanging on to my palate. And there's more of a malt balance in this one. Though its still as drinkable as ever.","Omnium","May 20, 2014"

Aromas are fresh with bread, caramel, tropical, mango, pineapple. On the palate there are notes of tropical, mango, papaya, loads of caramel, bready, toasted grain, plenty of malt cuts the seemingly not-so-bitter bitterness, tremendous balance here. Mouth-feel is super creamy, medium-full body, lower carbonation.

Joining in is some piney sweetness, slight alcoholic spice, and a touch of mint. Green, bitter pine resin and sweet malt taste. Citrus, fruit, grass, and a little bread. I don't know...this one isn't entirely doing it for me. Mellow by DIPA standards, but also just not my favorite blend of flavors. Bitter, creamy, and full bodied. I might give it another go next year. Right now I'm glad I got just the single bottle.","wedge","Jun 16, 2013"

Nose is sweet, sweet pineapple. Sweet malt, cookie like, caramel and sticky. Some earth and fresh mango. Fresh cut grass. The alcohol shows up on the nose as ti warms. Taste is very pineapple and has a little oil to coat the tongue right away so you don’t think it’s too sweet. Hops are plentiful but somewhat tame except for a good helping of pine. The malt character is sweet, buttery, and creamy with some biscuit. There’s some alcohol to bite and warm a little on the way down. Really the most pineapple in a beer I have ever had. It drinks smooth and refreshing with a full malt profile that is very rich and lasts throughout the drink. It’s almost heavy and just a bit syrupy. The hops stay forward and offer a good bitter on the back palate to bring it to a close with nice dry finish.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

Smells of tropical fruits, pineapple and mango, with a spicy hop twang behind it that slightly burns the nostrils on a deep inhale. Taste is big sweet clean malts, with tropical fruit hop flavors and a lovely bitter finish over the slightly sticky sweet aftertaste left from the malts.

It looks good, it smells pretty nice, but the flavors really seem to be in hiding until the beer warms up quite a lot. It's far from bad, but if I wanted to drink a IIPA, I'd drink something that gives me more flavor.. I feel like after awhile, this would taste like drinking corn syrup. On the plus side, it IS insanely drinkable for the first 12oz at least, and the 9.1% isn't noticeable. Once the beer is sitting at room temperature for awhile, there's a SLIGHT throat warming on the finish, but that's it. I'd definitely drink this again, but I must admit, I'm underwhelmed.","Alextricity","May 29, 2013"

It is pretty easy to drink though and goes down smooth. The body is great with tiny-bubbled carbonation and a silky mouthfeel. Like a good DIPA, it gets better as it warms.

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, honey, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity and moderate malt balance. Taste of big mango, pineapple, pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, grass, honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Moderate pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tropical fruit, citrus, pine resin, floral, grass, honey, bread, and hop earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance that doesn’t overshadow the hops, and zero cloying flavors lingering after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Big hop flavor complexity with moderate malt balance; and dangerously smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 23, 2013"

As a result of this, I'm going to pair this with a breakfast of a citrus bowl, French toast, and grilled light sausages - for dinner. In general, I don't enjoy standard IPAs because I find them unbalanced. This beer, and other Imperial IPAs I've tried, however, seem to be brewed with a much richer malt bill (and higher OG) that stands up to the IBUs, so not only is the sum of the parts bigger and fuller, it's also much better balanced. Another great creation from one of best breweries in the region.","BuckeyeSlim","May 23, 2013"

I enjoy this - definitely a good amount of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness to satisfy, however could use more flavor from hops and less bitterness...also the feel lacks a dry and drinkable quality which means I really only want 1 at any time.","Slatetank","May 14, 2013"

The nose was off the charts pineapple and just so aromatic with citrus. The flavor followed up with the same. This is still a sweet beer, but I got way more citrus and pineapple in this bottle. Note: Bottle was from the 2012 batch, so it was probably 2 or 3 months old, but still I really enjoyed it. Solid DIPA.","Kadonny","Sep 29, 2012"

This is also why we weren't so surprised at the sweetness of flavoring. Otherwise, there was a great and equally as sweet malty base to stand up to the fusel booze and bright bittering citric hops.","TheBrewo","Sep 07, 2012"

The flavor matches the aroma perfectly. The hop bitterness here is monstrous indeed. Try as I might to tease out some of the other flavors that I presume exist, I just can't get past the astringency of the hops. I should probably note that I'm not a fan of IPA's, so one as fierce as this is facing an uphill battle to win my affection.

Pours a wonderful honey gold into tulip glass w/a good fingers worth of head. Smells of citrusy hops like grapefruit and hints of sweet malts. Taste and mouthfeel; Wow, very nice, better than expected full, crisp, and grapefruit like right up front.

The nose of this beer is a bit of a monster with biting alcohol and pungent citrusy hops. This definitely pushes the DIPA limits with its abv, but could have used more aromatic hops. The taste is mellow with a hearty malt sweetness and complementary hoppiness. This translates to a well balanced, drinkable DIPA, but the alcohol unfortunately puts it over the edge. I can't sit here and relax with a couple 9% IPAs...I can essentially have 1 beer before call it a night if I'm expected to drive anywhere.

4.4,9.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall (4.5): I love this beer. If you’ve read this far into the review, it may not come as a surprise at this point but I think this is a seriously underrated DIPA from a very good brewery. Erie Monster is a seasonal release that I look forward to every year. I understand if it’s not a “top-tier” DIPA for most people—it is on the sweet side for West Coast fetishists and almost nothing could pack the aroma or blinding bitterness of something like Heady—but what I love about this beer is that I can’t think of anything else exactly like it. So, great job, Great Lakes! This is my favorite beer from this brewery, without a doubt.","fmccormi","Jun 18, 2012"

The nose is citrus, slightly resinous. American hops flavor dominates up front, with some maltiness in the middle, showing a bit of honey but no graininess. The finish is dry and bitter. The alcohol reveals itself mostly in the finish too, with a bit of heat. Feels big and slick.

The beer poured a clear golden/orange color with a large frothy white head. Nice retention, a little lace. The smell included citrus, orange peel, fairly floral, and malt. The taste had citrus up front again, pineapple & grapefruit; turning quite floral with a candied hops presence. In addition, caramelized malt. Has a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel was good....full body, medium low carbonation with slight alcohol on the finish. Overall a nice imperial IPA, with a very strong floral presence in the taste.

There's a billowing pile of cream colored foam sitting atop the beer, it comes up to four fingers in height. Head retention is solid, and there's lacing left behind in sheets. beautiful beer. Gorgeous looking beer. The nose has a certain aroma that I can only describe as grainy, it reminds me of the smell of a bag of crushed grains I get for homebrewing. There's aso some citrusy orange present, but the grainy sweetness is what dominates the aroma. That balance gets turned on its head in the flavor department. Orange marmalade is the primary flavor, though that same grainy note is also present. Bitterness packs a solid punch mid palate. The body is nice and light, fairly agile. The carbonation though is a bit lackluster, the beer feels like it dies mid palate. In fairness to Lake Erie Monster, it's probably got a little bit of age on it. Still, it's within the brewery's best by date, and right now it doesn't measure up to the better double IPAs out there.

3.85,-4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good DIPA, but it just can't hang with the heavy hitters like Hopslam and Double Trouble, but it's a good DIPA in it's own right. I really liked how this beer had a pretty heavy pineapple presence, most DIPA's tend to focus on the grapefruit and mango and let the pineapple take the backseat, but on this one the pineapple took the wheel nicely and let other fruits ride in the back. The flavor and drinkability is what I liked the most about this beer, the lighter body and the well hidden alcohol makes this beer pretty drinkable and it goes down faster then you would expect, especially on a hot summer day. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance when it came to incorporating the malts, the only thing that really came through was the sweetness and that was a little too much for my liking. I will probably buy a four pack when it is released next year and I would recommend this to most hop heads, the heavy pineapple presence makes it stick out from a lot of other DIPA's. This was another good and solid brew by Great Lakes, so far they are my favorite Ohio based brewery, I haven't had a beer from them that wasn't solid for it's style.","StoutHunter","Jul 14, 2011"

There's just no balance whatsoever, all insane piney/grassy/herbal hops with a splash of citrus/orange to boot. Mouthfeel is medium, again, oily and slick. If you love a hops-dominated beer, you'll like this one, but after one, I don't think I have the tastebuds to tackle another.","KeefD","Jul 01, 2011"

There's another very beguiling flavor that I can't quite pin down in the middle; it's not bad, but not necessarily good...it's a tropical flavor, maybe papaya.

Taste is brazenly hoppy, with a dry pine resin taste from start to finish. Hints of apricot and pink grapefruit struggle to emerge.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and citrus/bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hops, and weak alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I wish I had the opportunity to try this one while it was fresh, but it was still pretty damn tasty.

3.84,-4.5,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Pouring this into a tall glass it produces a thick buttery colored head. Slightly cloudy, honey colored. An unexpected amount of sediment. Peculiar haziness is probably a combination of that and the very slow rising bubbles. The yeast chunks (yes, chunks, that look like flakes) ride on the bubbles and actually look sorta cool. Smells less hoppy than when fresh, but still pungent. Pine, grass, some alcohol and malt evident. Full mouthfeel with nice creamy texture. Light carbonation but head lingers, 1/8""" after downing half. Moderate lacing, which seems to improve as I drink it down. When fresh, I describe this as a tongue scraper. While I'm not a hophead, this beer defies my preferences and prejudices. Strong malt backbone tempers the bitterness. Tastes almost as strong as it is with a good balance. Hoppiness is subdued yet assertive. Finishes with a resinous hoppy aftertaste. Not my everyday beer, but a welcome treat.","compass40204","Oct 15, 2010"

Quite solid retention given the age on this. Carbonation streaming form the bottom of this, and the clarity is quite hazy. Smells of peaches, tangerine, mango and some other light tropical fruits, heavy on the malt here also. Taste is lead by the sweet toffee and caramel malt and fruits, the big malt hits first and in quick and almost simultaneous succession the tropical fruits appear again. Leaves a touch of lingering bitterness on the tongue, and a burn of alcohol is present with this also. Mouthfeel is quite full, ABV is detectable and is fairly creamy and smooth throughout.

The aroma was a bit lacking, I smelled mostly yeast esters, alcohol and a little grapefruit rind. The taste was also a bit lackluster. The bittering was a little bit lacking for a DIPA and the hop flavors were not as bright and assertive as they should have been. There was a little biscuity malt and some zesty citrus rind, but overall there was not much hops. The mouthfeel was slick and a low level of carbonation with a semi-dry finish. The alcohol was well hidden, lower bitterness, and the finish allows this beer to drink more like an American IPA, and is perhaps a bit too drinkable to a fault.","Soonami","Aug 19, 2010"

It is a nice sticky, frothy head that one would expect on a nice double, and it leaves nice lace on the tulip as I imbibe this beer. The nose: not nearly as appealing. If I was to think of a DIPA as a sea monster, I would imagine it would have an aggressive and assaulting hop aroma. This beer is much, much sweeter than it is hoppy. Sure there are hints of citrus zest, and some herbal, more British notes, but the nose is mostly dominated by sweet, dark malt. The flavor is also disappointing in that, like the aroma, it is lacking in the hop department, even though I know this is a fairly fresh keg. The first thing I pick up is an odd cherry like flavor and malts that have kind of a brown ale nutty thing going on. Not unpleasant at all, but weird in a double IPA. The hops that are present seem to be neck in neck between herbal, earthy and orange. Bitterness is totally buried by the malt bill. The mouthfeel is medium and it finishes fairly clean, not as sticky as I would have expected. This beer hides its strength well, but I really would not be too interested in having another for a very long time. Great brewery, not such a great offering.","zoso1967","0"

The malt is a bit strong, contributing lots of caramel. There's some pepper and spice in there, too. The flavor has too much residual sweetness for my taste, but there's some good lingering bitterness. It's just a bit too simple and weak in hops.

Yay, I didn't have to buy a whole 4-pack. By the by, I'm cheap and tentative. My prize pours a clear apricot Jolly Rancher with a bit less than a finger of white foam on top. The nose comprises a deeply resin-y pine, heavy on the sap, a sort of mentholyptus effect, and violets. I suspect some caramel or something is hiding somewhere in there, but the 'lyptus is just too powerful, as though someone who's just devoured several cough drops is breathing heavily into my snifter. Luckily, the rest of the hoppy aromas mingle nicely with this semi-unexpected guest. The formally shy caramel shows up in the taste, though the conversation is still dominated by the pine resins. You can feel the stickiness in the taste, even before a true mouthfeel can be determined. Some citrus notes occasionally bring up new topics, but the pines and 'lypti (sure, that's the plural form...) take the ideas and run marathons. I'd rate this higher, but it all just seems overtly one-sided and overloaded with pine and fake-mint. The body is medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a somewhat chewy, definitely sticky feel. This one is almost there, but I think needs a tad more malt for proper balance (or something like that).","TMoney2591","Jun 19, 2010"

As the beer warms further, the hops and sweetness almost completely take over and our supported by a thick, creamy and smooth soft body. Appearance is a hazed, yet clear deep honey amber with a light creamy head that leaves a large amount of thin webs of lacing.

Then, rather oddly, the hops melt away at the finish. Rather than the long, lingering bitterness clinging to the back of the tongue, this beer sort of finishes up and moves on. Interesting.","Brent","Jun 01, 2010"

Alcohol adds a hit of medicinal off-flavors to the back of the palate, and the malts struggle in vain to keep up with pale & caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is chewy, and a little syrupy, but nicely carbonated and smooth on the finish with a lingering presence of alpha acids and booze. I love how Great Lakes sticks to the traditional brewing practices, but still manages to hit it out of the park with beers like Erie Monster, Blackout Stout, and Nosferatu (among others).

Flavor again sugar coated blast of hops I will definitely grab a bottle when I'm able to in order to compare the 2 versions. A touch of clean alcohol and hars bitterness from grapefruit like components but no other off flavors become unbearable throughout the whole drinking experience.

The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma (but a bit stronger), it's sweet and fruity, and also has a lingering bitter hoppy finish.

The sweetness was the first thing I noticed. Not a bad thing, just caught me off guard more than anything else. The sweetness quotient was higher than I'm typically fond of. Love the way everything comes together in the mouth...carbonation and consistency are superb. Hops is a bit relaxed compared to some other beers of this style. Alcohol also seems pretty noticeable. These things considered, I really dig this beer. I can't really explain it, but there are components to this beer that I've not been fond of in other beers. However, the total package is fantastic.

The head is minimal and there is no lacing on the glass. The smell is mildly of hops. The taste is intensely hoppy with citrussy grapefruit and orange rind flavors predominating. There is an equally intense caramel or butterscotch malty flavor to provide some backbone and contrast to this wonderful beer. The mouthfeel is rich yet smooth. As I finished it, I sadly realized there was no more to be had(my brother had given me just the one bottle). This might be the best beer I've had from Great Lakes.

Tastes of grapefruit, orange and lemon rind up front with a good caramel, brown sugar, and biscuit backbone helping balance out the beer before a nice dry pine presence finishes out the beer with a little bit of alcohol warmth mixed in. Medium in body and low in carbonation, this is one great balanced DIPA that has substantial sweetness and bitter characteristics and hides its 9% alcohol very well, just giving you a little hint that it's there.

Gritty earth flavors all the way through with this one. A zesty citrus hop sting towards the end that leaves a slick oily hop aftertaste. Fluffy light to medium body with a creamy texture.

Sweet pale malt and crystal upfront, with loads of fresh grassy/fruity american hop flavor that carries over into the aftertaste.

Very citric aroma and flavor but definitely under wraps a bit. Caramel shown through the hops. Not for hardcore hop heads. Sweetish, sugary flavor on top of the orangey hops. Juicy and sweet mouthfeel with a relatively bitter finish. Drinkability is really too high for this style. Basically, I liked this beer a ton but it certainly wasnt what I expected. The hops were one dimensional (huge citrus fruit) and the sugars were so high as to make the beer almost fruity as opposed to IPA like. Bitterness was present to be sure but it wasnt at the level of an average IPA let alone a DIPA. Conclusion, great beer but dont expect your typical Extreme DIPA. Perhaps these brewers should be commended for showing restraint in a time of giant beers.","DaPeculierDane","Aug 26, 2006"

The beer is well balanced though- the Hops are not to overpowering. My gf, who normally would pass on even an IPA, thought the beer was OK. It's definately a sipper though with the 9% ABV.

4.4,9.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Sampled from a 10 oz glass at the brewery. Being a lover of the hop - I was, of course, elated to hear that the special tap brew the evening I rolled into town was a Double IPA. At 9.5% abv, it was served in a smaller glass than the other brews, but was filled to the brim & had a very small perfectly white creamy head. It was a deep copper & the head had completely disappeared within about a minute. After about 15 minutes it had warmed to a perfect temperature for enjoyment. Loads of oily, piney hops with way more than a hint of caramel malt in the background. This brew coats the mouth beautifully with a relatively thick syrup-like fullness. Undertones of caramel & molasses are overshadowed quickly & permanently by generous doses of complex hopping. Hop profile has a little bit of everything - they are floral, earthy, citrusy, & piney. Wonderful balance between hop bitterness & sweet malt make this a delightfully easy to drink, well-crafted treat.","garthwaite","Beers"
