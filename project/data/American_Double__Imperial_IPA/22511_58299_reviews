review_text
"Pours a cloudy golden color with 2-3 fingers cloudy head with decent retention and leaving curtains of lace. The nose features hops hops hops with big floral and citrus (grapefruit, orange) notes, very dank and some toasted malts in the there also.  On the palate, again massive hops, floral, pine and citrus, dank and coating, some residual malt sweetness for balance.  It has a medium body, smooth and refreshing with lots carbonation.  Just a fantastic IIPA and dangerously drinkable!"

"I have to add:  This is one of those beers that you need to sit and have more and more of.. It seems to really open up and become even more impressive as your sitting goes, only other beer I've said this same thing about is Pliny the Younger"

"Incredible beer, and my first from Hill Farmstead (non-collab). The citrus fruits are amazing - kind of like you're drinking the best glass of juice ever. Feels thick. Hops not overpowering. Must find more!"

"My favorite beer to date.  Opague amber orange, nice lacing but the difference maker with Abner is the nose.  Holy shit!  Huge mango nose and pretty much any other citrus and tropical fruit you can think of.  Smell is beyond a 5.  Taste follows and although slightly boozy at the finish it's still absolutely crushable.  I can't get enough of this beer when I'm in VT and my mornings suffer as a result.  I can go on and on about Abner but you'll just have to try it yourself.  If you are heading up to VT with the highest expectations and you fear that as a result Abner may be a slight letdown what will likely happen is it will be better than you could've imagined.  It's that good."

"Right now... would rank as my favorite... but when ranking """feel"""... accessibility is a big thing for me. When leaving the brewery... and not knowing when I'll get to try this brew again... left me feeling a bit empty.  It is everything it is said to be... simply awesome. Having to hunt this stuff down for one glass... keeps me from ranking this a 5 across the board. This is a beer that should be #1... but will never be... because it won't reach enough mouths to experience such a piece of beauty in a beer. The fact that it is a 12 here... is only data... purely data."
""
""
"Oh Abner -- one of my all-time all-time favorites. Gorgeous golden color with just a bit of charming haze. Big hop aroma sings a prelude to the piney citrusy love affair that follows to the tongue. Everything about this beer flirts with blissful perfection."

"Rating from a draft I had on tap at the Mad Taco on 1/31/15.  It's up there.  All these Vermont Double IPAs is like arguing between being dropped in a shark tank with a cut open or left in a hungry grizzly beer cage wrapped in fish."

"O: The hype is real!  I've been waiting quite  a while to get my hands on this one.  Its incredibly well done (shocking, this is HF right?) and just so damn drinkable for 8.2.  Hard to say much more here other than go get this one!"
""
""
""
"Phenominal Taste, Full body, balanced hops and malts make this one of the best Doupl IPAs ive ever had, better than heady topper for me."
""
""
""
"Granny Smith Apple and dank on the nose. Taste is a hoppy apple jolly rancher and is awesomely smooth. Mouthfeel is smooth yet somehow syrupy all in one. Another great HF offering."

"From growler 1 day old. Beautiful color like all HF beers I have seen. Very approachable for a DIPA, we had 2 non DIPA loving guests over to try who actually enjoyed it. Very well integrated hops and long finish. I would feel comfortable serving this to relative newbies"

"Lives up the hype as an impecable ipa. It balances itself so well between the strong citrus and floral hop character and a creamy malty body. It's is delicious and complex, fantastic. Certainly an impecable beer with a great complexity and warming beer, impressed by the great balance here and the ridculous quality from start to finish."

"A nice Imperial IPA. It's big but balanced and carries that drinkable quality every Hill Farmstead IPA has."
"Presently, I live about 80 miles away from Hill Farmstead. After now having reviewed a handful of their beers, I realize that I would drive 180 miles each way. Maybe 280. And I'm not entirely happy about this. Abner is among the best I've had from Hill Farmstead. The hop profile is excellent, and it's so clean that I just want to drink more. The fact that this is 8.2% ABV is actually dangerous."

"Superbly balanced with an excellent blend of citrus and earthy hops.  As with most elite IPAs....you  enjoy it more and more with each sip and nothing takes a dominant role and the complexity unravels over time.  Another fine drinking experience.  Hill Farmstead has a collection of beers that will rival anyone in the world."

"WOW, what a great double IPA.  Goes down great without any bitter overly hoppy aftertaste.  Great aroma and smell and fresh citrusy taste.  Possibly the best beer I've ever had."
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Best beer I every had.  This means something since I had some amazing beers, like Heady Topper, Mastermind, Bourbon Stout from Goose before they were bought out..etc.  The piney and citrus flavors linger on your taste buds like a fine wine.  The complexity of the flavors is perfect.  It takes me 4.5 hours one-way to get to their brewery.  Well worth the travels!!"
""
""
""
"Overall, one of my favorite imperial IPA's for sure, but not by means my favorite. Amazing stuff though, hopefully I'll obtain more in the future."
""
""
""
"About as great as a beer can be. DIPA isn't even my favorite style, but I'd drink this all the time if I could."
"Shaun really missed the mark on the this one."
""
""
"Abner is a truly world-class beer. I confess that as of this review I haven't had Lawson's DS (but have had MBC Dinner, lots of Heady, Ghandi, etc..), and I've heard some people say they prefer DS - and others give the edge to Abner, but I think it would be nearly impossible to brew a better DIPA than this. Abner is the holy grail and well worth the drive into the NEK of Vermont, regardless of where you're coming from. If and when I do try Double Sunshine, I'll update this review."

"O) Not going to lie, this did not live up 100% to my expectations. When drinking DIPA's I have to compare to MBC Dinner, which I thought was spectacular. Would I drink it again, yes, but I would not go out of my way to acquire again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice hazy, light orange body. Loads of juicy tropical fruit, lots of sticky lacing on the sides and very orange forward in flavor, but leans toward the fresh sweet ones. Lip smacking, well done."
""
""
""
"Swing top bottle provided by maltzilla.  Clear yellow pour with a white head.  Fruity/citrusy hop aromas.  Really tasty with pleasant citrusy hop flavors supported by a sturdy caramel malt backbone..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, does Abner live up to it's high regards? Drink it fresh (this was 3 days old), and the simple answer is a resounding yes. This is up there with heady, and with it's raw character and perfect balance, it's safe to say that it can give heady a run for its money."

"It was a true pleasure drinking this - the last of hyped beers I've ever wanted to try, and a perfect closure to my beer journey in the past two years. I shall gladly drink this again, but I'm glad I don't have to fly to Vermont to do so right away. HF beers are of world-class quality, and Abner is no exception. Sets the bar for what a good homemade recipe can be, and what it aims to define as to why we drink excellent beer in the first place."
""
"Overall- Vermont double IPAs are a style that I don't quite understand. The ones I have tried have all been lighter than most single IPAs but pack a huge punch. This was a delicious, very drinkable beer but not what I look for in a double IPA."

"O: This is quite unique I must say in a world of copycats. From a brewery that mastered the DIPA style, I get this, and it is quite different but I can't seem to describe how it is different (maybe it's the use of more """traditional""" hops than what we are used to see in the DIPA scene). A must try for any hop-whores. This is very drinkable stuff too."
""
""
""
"My brother in law got this in a trade. It was fun to try something that we normally can't get in Wisconsin. This beer was very crisp and hoppy and all around, a very superb DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"All I can say is get some of this beer, this beer is going to be more common on Hill's Tap List in the coming future, so wait to see the response this beer will receive as more of a mainstay on the tap list like Edward...  Come to Vermont and get some of this or hit up a trader with a growler.  You won't be sorry."

"Poured from a 750 mL growler at the Toppling Goliath taproom at the King Sue release.  Really clean and bright yellow body.  Huge green nose with spruce tips, grapefruit rind, and almost a dankness/ditchweed character.  The beer has just enough sweetness and drinks like liquid hops.  Minimal bitterness cold, while there's a bitter kick at the end as it gets closer to room temperature.  Absolutely world class.  The body is so clean, and the mouthfeel is so smooth.  Nicely carb so it doesn't come across as sticky."
""
"This beer is exquisite, the hop flavors are so powerful yet blended and refined.  It develops over the minutes that it spends in the glass.  More flavors come out as I drink it.  Definitely an IPA experience like none I've had before.  I can't really think of any that are better than this right now"

"This is a absolute gem of a beer. Hits right off with a great citrus burst followed by a slight pine taste. Hard for me to rate against other dipas but its in the conversation as the best dipa out there. Great carbonation and a fantastic smell. They should make women's perfume that smells like this."

"O - What a fantastic beer. Like all Hill Farmstead beers I've had, it doesn't hit you over the head with flavor and leave you trying to catch up. Rather, it invites you in to savor all the layers of flavor and fermentation expertise that go into the beer. The somewhat tame nose confounded me somewhat, but the experience of actually drinking this beer is one not soon forgotten."

"O - If I lived in VT, I do not believe I would drink anything else. I'm sure it's like anything, you'd get tired of it after a while, but it would be very hard in my book. As I mentioned before, I am absolutely in love with this beer. I can't thank Steve enough for sharing this with me. If you haven't had it yet, trade everything for it. And if you have had it, why are you drinking anything else! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very solid DIPA, and I enjoyed it. However, I enjoyed a number of the other HF hoppy beers I've tried much more. It surprises me greatly that this is the highest rated of the bunch. Glad to have tried it, but certainly not one I would seek out again."

"Orange amber pour with a nice khaki head that sticks and laces fine. Nice hop aroma, not overwhelmingly bitter, but nicely present and complex - citrus, layers of tropical fruit, pineapple, guava, a bit of dank pine and resin, and just hints of pale malts in there. Great flavor as well, balanced hop bitterness, not too much, moreso packed with hop flavor, more citrus, tropical fruits, etc. Hints of pale malts just present and doughy enough to balance it out."

"Overall, one of the best DIPAs I have ever had, very well balanced and full of big, complex hop flavors. The brewers here in Vermont seem to be creating their own version of IPAs, very similar to west-coast but less bitter and with a more prominent yeast ester contribution. Hill Farmstead is living up to the hype."

"I would be interested to see how this would be with slightly more malts. Had about seven people taste this last night - including a friend who drinks beer like Sam and PBR - and he even enjoyed it if that was any testament to how nearly perfect this beer is."

"There is no doubt that this is a world-class IPA. What Shaun has done with this beer is create something that is classic, rustic, and sharp all at once. It's highly drinkable...in fact, it is crushable (though it may end up crushing you). I finished off the 750ml growler by myself. I am feeling the effects: lulling me to sleep, spreading a smile across my face. I am so glad that I got to try this beer. This is something that the Beer Hunter would have been excited to try."

Taste is more balanced, notes of grain and some underlying sweet malt. Extremely clean with no sugars, tons of hop punch. Strong grapefruit and pine with a touch of resin. Bitterness is present but well integrated through the soft well carbonated finish. Body is delicate and light. Great stuff."

"a demonstration in the art of dry hopping, this beer is a genius, and in some ways represents the final evolution of ipa, i mean, what more could we want in the style than abler, its the pinnacle for me. fresh growler filled at the source over the weekend, about as fresh as possible in denver. a wonderful pale hazy honey color, delicate and soapy white head over an inch tall fades very slowly. the nose is the best part of this beer, so hoppy, so fresh, so minimally bitter. its the best part of hops, the citrusy bursting ripe freshness, tropical fruits, its like fresh squeezed pineapple juice blended into a really awesome ipa, thats what it smells like, and its mouthwatering. the taste is a little less fruity and a little more to the point, which is a hoppy point, a long finishing refreshing juicy hoppy flavor, not oily and resinous like its west coast brethren, but soft and calculated. there is an understanding here of the art of brewing and of the use of hops that i have not seen equalled. the growler is not the most friendly format to the beer, its best right from the tap, but this is an ipa like none other. just carbonated enough, and very light for its strength. the grain gives the hops just enough to lean on without interfering. tangerine and lemon come into play, but no acidity at all. the finish is mouthwatering again, i just can't get enough of this stuff. every bit as good as pliny or heady or whatever else people clamor on about as the best india pales out there. this is the one for me. the only thing i would change is availability."

"Finally had a chance to have this beer in Vermont.. Great beer nice smooth American IPA.. Smooth is how I can describe it.. Hops are just right in this beer..

"Schnikies!!! Had no idea what I was walking into here, but SHAZAM! was I pleasantly impressed. Poured from tap into a tulip glass at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont. Deep orange/amber color and expected cloudiness. On the nose, the scent of citrus pine was easily overwhelmed by grapefruit/orange scents. On the palate, hops assert and the malts were nicely subdued. On the palate, the theme repeats itself, with a nice, clean hoppy burn on the end. The mouthfeel is more than drenching full/substantial. I think I like this well-crafted monster (dare I say it) better than the infamous Heady Topper of similar profile. All in all, a remarkably fabulous experience!"

"Growler is a week old. Just got returned to me from a damaged package. Didn't want to send it again as a two week old growler. Looks like the shipping hasn't affected it. Pours a murky yellow/orange. Small head but great lacing left on the glass. The smell isn't overwhelming but it's very pleasant. Citrus is dominant. The taste is very well balanced. The citrus and grass/pine mesh well and nothing specific stands out. There is a nice slight bitterness, and it's not too sweet. Carbonation has held well. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and spot on, like most HF ipas. This has to be my favorite HF beer, if not my favorite of all time. It's so easy to drink with so much flavor. Abv is hidden very well."

"O: Undoubtedly one of Hill's finest. Don't take my word for it though, it's one of Hill's most reviewed and still perfect. One of the few beers I could drink without end. Try it if you can."
"Wonderful pale gold color with white head. Aroma is of freshly cut hay, honey, and a slight piney-ness to it as well. Taste is much more piney than the aroma. I also get some of the honey flavor; presumably from a light malt. The color also hints that they used lighter malts. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but I did enjoy the hop 'sting' on the tongue. Overall a great DIPA; I haven't been disappointed by Hill Farmstead yet, and doubt I will be any time soon."
"O - I was delighted to get this beer on draught at the brewery (after a 4 hour wait!!!) but thought that this beer did NOT live up to the experience or the hype. Hill farmstead makes good beers but in my opinion and experience totally not worth it. Sorry HF fans."
"A brilliant IPA from HF, my favorite from them so far. One of the better IPAs I have sampled."

"Overall this beer is one of the best double IPAs I've ever had. It beats out Pliny and Heady, but its kind of unfair since this is Hill Farmstead we're talking about. It's up there with Double Sunshine as one of the best to come out of Vermont."
"O - This might be the most balanced IPA I have ever drank. About the only thing bad I can say about it is it is too smooth, too light, and there is nothing in your face about it."

"Hazy golden orange colour, one finger of dense white head with a solid ring of lace. Smell is quite dank with tropical fruits, some fuzzy peach and a bit of lingering malt. Taste is hoppy with lots of grapefruit and dank pine resin flavours, more citrusy as it goes dry with a moderate malt flavour as well in the finish. Medium carbnation, dry and fairly full bodied. Excellent stuff here, so incredibly easy to drink with no alcohol to taste, would drink this as often as I could."

"Tasted against Double Citra, Legitmacy, and Nelson Single Hop. Of the four, I ranked this one 1st. In fact, this is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I will now often wonder when I'll get to have this off tap again..."
""
""

""
""
"O- This is yet another fantastic beer from Hill Farmstead! It took me 3 trips up (the first 2 it came off the tap list the day before and the day of arrival!), but it was well worth the wait!"
"Overall: Definitely a solid double pale ale. Hop forward but a well balanced hop forward ale. Very smooth and refreshing."
""
"Overall: This may set the standard for DIPAs. What a fantastic beer. I really didn't know what to expect upon cracking this growler open. Boy, am I glad I did. This may be one of my favorite beers of all time. Hill Farmstead did an amazing job crafting this one. Especially since I know it came together in a tiny ass garage. Shaun and crew, I tip my hat to you guys for an exceptional beer and experience."

"Fans of all out grapefruit bombs will marvel at this bold IIPA as it delivers the goods in every way.

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. While the nose gives a strong, balanced, juicy rendition of the liquid to come, the ultimate taste is astonishing from that first sip. The hops remain dripping wet, sweet, and juicy, but take on a curiously strong bitterness of grapefruity rind and citrics. The yeast works its way in giving bitterness, along with that harder well water that is so apparent, but seamlessly inclusive. The feel on the sip gives just about all you could ask for, with frothy brushes of creaminess and enough pucker to wake you up. This is a must have from Hill Farmstead, and well deserved of the reputation it has thus far attained."

"O: Very good, well constructed beer. Quite drinkable. That being said, it wasn't quite blow-my-mind good, and it seems that there are much easier to get options out here in SoCal (e.g., most IPAs from Alpine would be better than this). But I was very glad for the opportunity to try this."

"There's only so many words that can capture beers as good as this, let alone with the likes of What Is Enlightenment, Legitimacy and Heady Topper. Blasts of unfathomable citrus, the taste goes on and on and on. These here Hill offerings are the best of the best, hands down - the end of the line."
""
"Pours a hazy peach honey with some soapy top suds. Smells of peaches, mangoes, some resin and some biscuit malts. Not that impressed on the nose. Flavor is malt, more peach, some pear, grapefruit, lemon, resin and more crackery malts. A little sweet, but some bitterness in there too. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish. Although decent, not overly impressed with this one either. Of the imperial IPAs I've had from Shaun, I've yet to really feel like he has done much for me, a little too sweet in 2 out of three (best so far was S&S4). The pale ales have been tits though."

"overall, really good."
"Cloudy pale orage color with decent white head that laces a bit. Aroma on this thing is killer! Smelled it once and started giggling it made me so happy, orange and ruby red grapefruit juice with hints of pine. Flavorwise, it's everything the nose leads with plus an added strong earthy hop punch. The earthiness starts to come out in the nose at it warms as well. It can be described as a bit garlicy. I get a bit of that sauteed onion and garlic with fresh herbs type of impression right after the initial citrus juice impression, but it fades on the finish. Super smooth bitterness here, very drinkable 8% IPA!"

"O - Hill Farmstead prides themselves on making hop forward pale ales, and this is a shining example of their craft. Not like many of the Imperial IPA's you see out there that seem to have either bitterness or sweetness turned up to ten. As they classify this as an Imperial Pale Ale, I see this designation most fitting. You get the best of a nice clean pale ale with the best of a Imperial IPA showing off its hop muscles. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone as this is a beer that transcends all tastes. Impeccable..."
""
""
""
"O - Abner is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had that compares and rivals Heady Topper. Definitely is worth the hype and worth seeking out. Very well balanced, smooth and very easy to drink. Hill Farmstead really has crafted a masterpiece with this beer. Will always get this when available."
""
"Worth seeking out, definitely memorable!"

"Overall this is one of the best IIPAs I've tried. Definitely in close competition with heady. Very different from Permanent Funeral and Hopslam. I wish it were just a tad easier to get in Wisconsin."

"O: What can I say? I drove for hours into the Hills of Vermont with 3 other people wondering where the hell I was taking them.... then out of the dark clouds a beam of light lit up a small farm in the lush green Vermont Hills, where a lovely lady brought us cold samples of sweet nectar.... and on a serious note, this is a seriously good beer.... I don't want to say it is less complex than Heady, but I would say it doesn't try so hard to highlight every single hop known to man....and as my gf states """it doesn't make your face feel like its being blasted off with hops)... what it does is take a large amount of hops, balances them extremely well, keeps them in check with natural carbonation, still bursts forward with amazing aromas and adds a little of that special """ingredient""" that makes HF worth that never ending drive... a very well made beer that lives up to the hype that the brewers have tried so hard to get away from.... (if you believe that...)"

"Overall - Wow. This is one of the absolute best brews I have ever had. This has no comparison but if there is a lineup and that lineup has Pliny (Snappy crisp west coast), Heady (Floral as hell), and Dubs (Juiciest DIPA you can get), this is the higher quality version of Sixpoint Resin that further enhances what they were trying to do with that brew. A true king among brews."

"O/D - I enjoyed this quite a bit. Tons of hop depth. Really nice to sip and contemplate. Hops really shine well. I can't tell if I could drink a ton of this, but it was definitely a pleasure."

"Poured into a tulip glass, the appearance is a honey tone with a finger of head. The nose on this DIPA has oranges, hops, sugar, a bit of lemon. Moving on to tipping it back and I taste pineapple, grass, bread malts, a general low-key sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, near-perfect carbonation level on this. All in all, another very good-great DIPA from Hill Farmstead."
""

"Pours a beautiful bright orange with thin white head. Strong aroma of citrus fruit with sweet floral notes and a slight yeasty quality. Flavor of white grapefruit, grass and mango. Wonderfully medium bodied with light carbonation. Very fine bubbles give it a smooth mouthfeel leading to a crisp finish. Lingering bitter aftertaste. No doubt a world class beer."
""
""
"I know what makes this special is its hard to get, but I wish it was a little easier. I love this so much I want to drink it year round."
"O~ definitely a great IPA, i love how their saison style comes through a little bit on this one. i could drink this every day when i'm in a hoppy mode, recommended for sure!"

"Straight up im a sucker for that insane doub smell and the abner delivers a smell thats right up there withe the best DIPAs. Hops for days hits you in the face and it hurts so good. I think of this as a perfect mix between Lawsons doub sunshine (more tropical) and Heady Topper (more citrus). I found a perfect mix between citrus and tropical fruit, however that hoppyness took the cake. I pick up on some more earthy resinous tastes that I quire enjoy, but not as much as some DIPAs- well ballanced I was fortunate to drink it fresh as hell so the carbonation was on point. One of the best HFs I have tried so far and not too far removed from the Society & Solitude #6 but on a differnt level- whatever there so damn good its hard to go wrong with an HF"
""
""
""

"I was lucky enough to try this on tap in Waterbury, VT tonight. Pours a hazy orange color, with a thick creamy head. Smell is excellent; very hoppy, tending more towards the citrusy side, but it's complex. Tastes very much like the smell. It's full of hops, but well balanced with a bit of malt. It's not overly bitter, but not even close to sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding; Full, with real body, perfectly carbonated. Overall, this beer is all about balance. It's not quite perfect, but the balance of all the factors is pretty damn amazing. Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had."

"The beer pours an effervescent, hazy yellow-orange with an inch of a dense, creamy looking white head. A vigorous swirl regenerates the head and washes away the lacing. The nose has a subtle hoppiness that's slightly floral and citrusy followed by a modest sweetness. The taste manages to pack in even more flavor that reminds me of a cleaner, more drinkable heady topper (...which seems insane to say). The beer has an absolute perfect balance between hop fruitiness, bitterness, and sweetness from the malt and added sugars. The aftertaste is slightly citrusy and bitter and finishes semi-dry as a gush of carbonation carries the beer down into the depths of my innards. This beer is certainly world class and worth trying...but I can't see it being bottled for the masses."
"This poured out as a nice hazy looking yellowish orange color with a big foamy white head on top. The Lacing was sticky and the rentention was very good as well. The smell of the beer has a large amount of floral and fruity hope aromas. The taste has a nice sharp pine flavor in there that is surprisingly balanced with the malt base. The mouthfeel is lighter and very drinkable. The carbonation was good also. Overall it's a great brew. Definitely something I could see drinking again in the future."

"Growler courtesy of a friend. I owe him big! Poured into some Hill Farmstead Stemware. This beer has a nice murky orange hue. There is a slight head to the pour and some minimal lacing. The smell is of sweet and bitter citrus. The taste starts off with some swwet hoppiness, think orange and pineapple and finishes up with some bitter lemon zest that lingers nicely. You want to repeat this all day! The carbonation is spot on and this beer is easily drinkable. Happy to have tried this!"

"Had this at the """Prohibition Pig""" in the wonderful Waterbury, VT. This beer was delicious and definitely on par with the Heady Topper although quite different tasting. The Edward is one of my favorite beers and this tastes almost identical to me only with more body and higher ABV. The aroma was out of this world with lots of pine and citrus. Remarkable smooth and the perfect pairing with the 12 hour smoked brisket and bacon BBQ sauce."

"Still not quite up there with Heady and Kiwi Rising IMO, but a solid DIPA. Would like a bit more citrus to balance out the IBUs a bit."
""
"Outstanding beverage. Smells of faint peach and apricot hit the nostrils from the hope varieties I assume. Gorgeous cloudy pale orange that looks like an autumn sunrise and has an ultra smooth mouthfeel that is creamy and just gorgeous. Yet another great offering from HF."
""
"Overall: Well to be honest I am in FFF territory and so used to their hop profile that I often told myself they are hard to beat. Well this is right up there if not better than any FFF offering. Heady Topper I had the pleasure of enjoying once and loved that but let me tell you this is just as good, IMO!"
""

"o - Overall another awesome beer from HF and a great DIPA. Up there with their best beers and on par with something like Ephraim IMO, though I still prefer their Society & Solitude #4 and #5. Super hoppy and not a lot of bitterness, would love to have this one again sometime."

"O - Heady Topper to me is the greatest IPA of all-time, but this one is right behind and it and in the same ballpark. The hop character even reminds me of Heady.

Definitely get this if you can and drink it fresh."

"Growler thanks to oteyj. Pours a glowing, deep, muddy orange- hazy. Medium, off-white head. Webby, bigger lace. Nose is sugary apricot, vanilla, jackfruit, pineapple, sugary braised kumquat. Moves to sugar artificial orange Gatorade powder with meaty melon characters. Taste is bright, astringent, quite tart/acidic and big lemon. Grapefruit sections. Lacks finesse. Way too rip your head off for me. 11/22/2011 8/4/7/4/14=3.7"

"Overall (4.5/5): Abner is a stellar example of an imperial IPA, one that is eye-catching and incredibly fruity–a Hill Farmstead trademark. Highly, highly recommended to those that favor Double/Imperial IPAs that treat hop flavor as a greater virtue than outright """bigness.""""

"Such a good beer (for the hop head)."

""
""

"Overall. I'd been wanting to try this guy for over a year now. It's everything I had hoped for and would kill to have this in my keggerator. Amazing."
"Overall pretty decent but a real subtle take on a double IPA."
"O: Fantastic, certainly lives up to its reputation. Extremely easy drinking and well balanced. A beer that I could drink at any time."
""
""
""
"Broken record in my HF reviews, but this beer is phenomenal. Every IPA I've ever had has been liquid gold and this right up there among my favorites."
"A good big hoppiness. Foamy head on orange body, lacey. Fuller mouthfeel A wild yeast aroma, and some hops there in the smell. The second glass made the difference (and was a cleaner glass). Good mouthfeel for a DIPA. Citrus hoppy orange.On tap at the Prohibition Pig."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is somewhat crisp but bold and aggressive with the bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable in this one but it integrates quite nicely. Of the hoppy HF offerings I have had lately, I give this one a slight edge over the others for having a bit more distinguishable character. But overall, the hoppy offerings from this brewery are so similar that I have no desire to seek them out anymore."
"From the source, 1 week old. Looks like other Hill hoppy beers I've had. Opaque, sort of orangeish deep honey. One finger white head. Not much if any lacing. The aroma is so complex. Pine, citrus, dank wet hops, almost earthy dirty grit. Very green hop aroma. Pretty insanely complex flavour to match the complex aroma. Citrusy, pithy, and well yes bitter. Abner is a little dank. The biggening is all hops, then you get some malty quality. There is certainly a little crystal malt in here adding a hint of sweetness to balance the hop assault. On my palate this beer is full, juicy from the hops, and well rather good. Could be a hint more dry. Overall this is a tad sweet for me, but that is the only thing I could possible say to take away from how awesome this beer is. Balance, huge hops, great balance, top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent DIPA, worthy of being in Heady Topper, Pliny the Elder, Double Sunshine conversations. This beer has a lot to suggest it, but at the moment what's striking me is how much it rises to the challenge of justifying such a high ABV. Few beers match the ABV intensity increase (in comparison to APAs / IPAs) so well with hop intensity increases, or appropriate mouthfeel. Geniusly crafted beer, as expected from Hill Farmstead."
""
""
"O- I have had this beer many times but never reviewed it. Thought I owed Abner and Shaun another big score on the board. This beer is well planned, perfectly crafted and is just what I looking for. Crisp clean amazing beer. I may be a Hill Farmstead homer but even the Negative Nancies cant knock Shaun Hills ability to again an again make some of the best beers on the planet."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and smooth with a slightly drying finish. Overall, Abner is an exceptional DIPA that deserves to be right up there with the best of them. Very reminiscent of Heady Topper, with just a bit more bitterness and not quite as fruity."
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Lots of sticky hop oils. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would be inclined to say I'm being generous toward this beer given the particular setting, but I also consumed a growler of HF Citra IPA, from the same box, prior to this trip, in my drab apartment. I found that one amazing, as well. I review harshly, but there's simply nothing to criticize here. This is an affordable, exceptionally well-crafted beer. It is hard to acquire in trade for a reason. I'm sorry to contribute to the hype, but this is world-class. I hope I get to drink a 2L of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"As always, thanks for the opportunity to drink a want and for allowing me the chance to try this."
""
"Truly, perhaps my favorite DIPA I've tried to date (I need to try this and Citra side by side!). Everything about this beer is remarkable. Perfect? I'm not sure if I buy into that notion in a beer, but this is damn close."
""
"Abner ranks among the best IPAs -- nay, *beers* -- I've ever tasted. Seriously, this stuff is incredible. Wish I could drink it every day :("
""
""
"O: My favorite HF beer and a great IPA. Definitely one I want to have again soon!"
"Poured a hazy golden-orange color with a nice finger's breadth of white head that retained well and left soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice mix of citrus, pine, and tropical fruits. Similarly, the taste is expectedly hop-driven, fresh citrus zest, mango, pine resin, overlaid on a biscuity malt base, some burnt caramel present, mild alcohol bites here and there. Medium body, and quite enjoyable for any hophead. Still, among my least favorite from HF."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would say this is in my top 3 favorite DIPA's I would say this is slightly behind Kern Citra and Heady Topper. Great beers"
""
"Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler or $18 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit)."
""
"O: as good as any DIPA I've had. I'd go out of my way to trade for that one again"
"O- Another fantastic DIPA out of Vermont. Definitely one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, I'd drink this over just about any other DIPA including some of those other VT ones. Everything blends perfectly with nice fruity hop characteristics and insanely easy to drink. I'll definitely be drinking this again in the future. Have to have this fresh. I've had it fresh from the growler and on-tap and both times it blew me away."
"In a style class that is brimming with stars, this one makes the all star team. I’m already dreaming of a tasting: Pliny, Heady, Citra, Double Sunshine, and this for the MVP award"
"Medium bodied, perhaps a little on the light side for an imperial IPA, with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Exceptionally well done."

"Poured from 1.5L swingtop growler (less than 5 day old) into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to a fellow BeerAdvocate for going to the HF release party to pick up a growler for me. Pours hazy gold with a thin white head that lasts very nicely throughout. Wow! The aroma reminds me of the Ephraim, I pick up some mango, tangerine, pineapple, and some grass. The flavor sure reminds me of the Ephraim as the aroma clearly suggested at the beginning. Sweet pines, some lemon, mango, and pineapple are detected across the tongue as well. Thin and smooth mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. This is a very dangerously drinkable DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Glad to have tried this one out!"
"Beer pours a beautiful hazy yellow-orange with a nice white head. The appearance makes me think of citrus fruit for some reason, and really is the perfect color for a DIPA. Smell is incredible - I get a blast of citrus fruits and amazing hops. The taste follows suit, it's really like a party in my mouth, bright citrus flavors take the lead, but this is incredibly balanced and easy to drink for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, medium-bodied with excellent carbonation a bit of tingling and even some stickiness. Overall, this really might be my favorite beer ever. I've had it countless times, but drinking it on tap is the way that this beer needs to be consumed. Some of the growlers have held up really well, others not so much, but it would only get this score from me on tap. When served straight from this tap, this beer deserves a perfect 5.0 score, the best score I've ever given to a beer on BA."

"O - Hill Farmstead is quickly growing to be one of the best small breweries out there and when they release bold, flavorful, and well-balanced beers like Abner, there's not question as to why. An excellent Double IPA, Abner seamlessly features of plethora of hops for a joyous outcome."

"Overall certainly one of my favorite DIPA's. World Class. Each sip left me in great anticipation of the next. Scary drinkable. Probably my favorite from Hill Farmstead to date. Thank you Shaun Hill."

"Overall (4.5): This is a wonderful beer. It doesn’t have quite the lightning-flash bitterness that Heady Topper does, and it could stand to show a little more cereal complexity in the malt profile, but this does exactly what you want and hope it would do. It gets even better as it warms, which is just wonderful for the style, too. This is an exceptional DIPA."
"Overall this is tremendously enjoyable and I was eager to take each sip. I wish I could regularly get my hands on this. One of the most unique DIPAs I've had."

"Pours a hazy light orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is absolutely incredible with huge tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas in perfect harmony. Taste is pretty much the same with all of the delicious fruity flavors. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good fruit forward beer that I am very happy I got a taste of."

"O: What do you know? A delicious DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Shaun knows how to kill it and I wish I could these beers all the time. Incredibly balanced and overall just delicious."

"Another VT DIPA that would put many west coast beers to shame. a great and unique blend of hop flavors/aromas attack your palate and do not let go, even after you finish."
""
"The palate comes close to out-Plinying Pliny. That's not something I would say easily, simply because Elder (IMO) stands apart from almost every other DIPA out there due to the way that it captures both, the delicacy that hops can bring with their power. Abner, in my book, is the only other beer this big that does that. Juicy citrus with a melange of tropical fruit (ripe papayas, ripe mangoes, ripe oranges). A touch sweet on the mid-palate with a blend of citrus juice sweetness (from the hops) and some light caramel malt and honey. Drying on the finish with an exquisite blend of mellow bitterness and ripe, redolent fruit. Bitterness is moderate throughout, in balance with the fruity sweetness that the hops bring. Not particularly resiny either. Medium-light in body, this beer is a little too carbonated (initially at least), and has a wonderful finish. Of particular note is the lack of a green/leafy hop character that many hop-bombs end up having. Absolutely delicious, exceptional stuff, my favorite HFS beer yet."

"Overall, another spectacular DIPA from Hill Farmstead. I honestly cannot say which of their DIPAs I like best as they are all so top notch. Abner is really flavorful, yet drinkable. A really solid combination of sweet and bitter notes. I would get this anytime they have it on tap. Awesome."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, thanks Satchboogie for bringing this back from the event yesterday. Pours very murky orange yellow, with a sticky one inch white head, a nice ring of lace. Smell is citrus heaven, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, grass, and tangerine. Taste wow, this is a Vermont style DIPA. All those flavors in the nose, more pungent then you expect, with smack of grapefruit mixed in the finish. Body is on the large side, enough carbonation, lush not dry, and crazy drinkable. Closest beer I have had with this taste is Heady Topper and I will have a side by side soon. This is possibly the best I have had."

"O: What a sensational beer. Hill Farmstead hasn't dissapointed with Abner, which in my humble opinion, was leaps and bounds better then their more prestigious Ephraim. When seeking out one of their hoppier brews, make sure you really take your time in considering this, as it's phenominal stuff."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a great beer. It had a very good range of hoppiness to it with some juicy, fruity, Citra hop like notes at times and some piny, resiny grapefruit flavors in the finish. Very drinkable and flavorful beer of the style."

"Overall: Exceptionally drinkable, barely a hint of that 8.0%. And always that outrageous, fresh-from-the-farm taste you get with all of Hill’s brews."
"4.5 D: Hill Farmstead has to be one of the best breweries in the world. Everything they make is great. After having another killer DIPA, it's safe to say that there's no question that they know what to do with hops. Solid brew all around."
"Overall awesome, but not quite as great as Edward or Heady Topper, but otherwise really nice. great hops, nice balance, a bit too much on the musty resinous hops and bitterness than it could have done with tropical fruits etc, but very good otherwise."
"O - Overall this is a masterfully crafted beer. Seriously amazing stuff. Stellar appearance and delicious in the mouth. Another typical """must drink""" from Hill Farmstead."
"O-I really loved this beer. The second or third time I've had it, and I seem to enjoy it more each time. Tied with the Double Citra as my favorite Hill Farmstead brew, and definitely one of the top DIPA's I've had."
"Overall this example is much more drinkable IMO than Ephraim and one I prefer in the long run. It's almost reminiscent of a single IPA which makes it fun but very dangerous at the same time. Thumbs up!"
"This beer pours a straw yellow color with a little bit of haziness to it, there is a nice white head. the smell id citrus and piney hops and a hint of bready malt. the flavor follows suit with a mango of grapefruit flavor and a nice bitter piney hop finish , nice and dry. . overall this is a damn fine beer.the mouthfeel is dry and well carbed light body"
"This is an easy drinking DIPA. I thought it was a pale ale at first. Great hop flavors. I could drink a billion of these."
"As I've come to expect from HFS, this has a huge resiny hop bite. Very bitter and dry, though it avoids tasting astringent, and the big fruity hop flavors do a great job of balancing the bitterness. There's a dry malt backbone here that does actually provide some body and heft, though it isn't a sweet beer at all. The mouthfeel suffers a bit from all the sediment - it has a slightly chalky texture. Overall it's very enjoyable, but not as impressive as Ephraim."
"O: A decent, but not top-tier dIPA. I guess the Hill Farmstead IPAs just don't do it for me."
"This beer goes down like nothing and tastes delicious. It's not a life-changing beer, but the hop profile is great. I missed Ephraim on tap by a day; I wish I could be able to compare it to that."
"O - Wonderful brew. Very well balanced. This is the beer that ran out first at this event at Capone's and ran out first at TJ's. I put it near the top of all double IPAs. It has a bit more pineapple flavor than their double citra. It is somewhat-like Heady Topper."
"O - Even with the growler issues this is a nice DIPA."
"One of my favorite Hill Farmstead items. Wow, I have to get more of this one! (if possible)"
"O- This beer is top notch stuff. The taste is pretty close to perfect to me. Mainly bitter with some sweet citrus. It also poured beautifully and was a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazed golden amber color with orange highlights, big cap of white froth and good sticky lacing. Scent is a wonderful blend of citrus and tropical fruit... orange, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, faint notes of light bready malt. Taste leads with sharp bitterness before it becomes all about the fruit, crockery malt makes an appearance at the end before the bitterness returns. Medium bodied, smooth, dry. Great fruit forward dIPA with one of the best noses around."
"I'm very happy to have gotten the chance to enjoyed Abner. With Ephraim to come, I'm really blown away at one breweries' capability to produce their quality of different hop forward recipes. Delicious and just my style."
"It might be unfair to rate this under the circumstances, but I felt like I got the gist of it. I don't feel like my review can hurt this at all. A's are A's. This is one I definitely hope to revisit under better conditions."
"Pours a very cloudy straw gold with a small head. Smell is sublime huge citrus hop presence with a slight sweetness. Taste is out of this world, it has that super hoppy iipa bite but with a malt balance I have never encountered before...so blown away. Mouthfeel and carbonation are great as well. Overall the best iipa I have had in a very long time...Thanks Mark"
"Overall: The hop profile is amazing, just loving the pine notes. The finish was tasty and the beer sticks with you. Really good."
"A good DIPA, but not as solid of a showing as batches of Ephraim."
"I love this beer, definately get it, try it, if you can!"
"Overall: This is a well made, balanced, hop bomb. Very good, I have no qualms about finishing a decent portion of this growler."
"O: Just a truely exceptional DIPA. Really ranks up there for me....just like with most BAers. I'd love to sample again down there line. Cheers to Tim and Dan."
"Taste is a huge punch in the mouth! Very bitter, sharp pine and citrus with just such a bitter bite on the end it's really delicious. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, really good beer."
"O - An outstanding DIPA/Imperial IPA and one of the finest I've ever had!!!"
"Had on tap at Blue Dog Chalfont's Wealth of Riches event. Poured on tap into large tulip. Beautiful foam crown. Great piney, citrusy nose. What a fabulous smelling beer. My favorite IPA to date, this has he most wonderful floral, grapefruit, piney taste. The mouthfeel is sublime. If you could only swish and spit your beer, this is the one. Fortunately you can swallow. GREAT beer."
"Medium carbonation, everything done just about right. I really liked this DIPA overall, very solid."
"On tap @ HF anniversary. Hazy orangey gold pour with white head. Juicy hop aroma, very potent aromas of centennial along with a whole variety of other stuff I imagine. Taste is hoppy, with a light honey twist. Very refreshing palate, dry but not abusively so. EVery good IIPA"
"O - I had this right after indulging in some Heady Topper, so poor Abner never stood a chance. It's good, but not up with the best DIPAs."
"On tap at The Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT. 10-12 oz. pour into a Hill Farmstead longstem snifter. Cloudy pale gold color, and the beer was very cold. Head faded quickly but decent lacing. Nose is tropical/citrus with very little bitterness. At first sight and smell, I am curious as to how old this keg is. The last time I was in this establishment was late April, when I tried HF Double Galaxy. I have to say the Abner was delicious but not as impressive overall as the Double Galaxy. I am still very impressed by Hill Farmstead; I just think this keg was a bit aged and muted for a highly rated DIPA."
"A polished balance between bitterness and flavor. Dank and hoppy with a tropical fruit finish. Citrus and grapefruit all over. Bitterness lingers just long enough until you take another sip. A little more bitter than most west coast heavy hitters but think this is where Abner excels and stands out from the pack. This beer is damn near perfect."
"Hill Farmstead makes some of my favorite DIPAs. Abner, Galaxy, Double Citra, and Ephraim are all so fantastic. With all these other amazing DIPAS coming out of HF, I hope Abner is always a regular and not forgotten. I will continue to make the long trek up there for my fill and look forward to what comes next."
"O/D-Nailed it. My goodness can Vermont put together a good beer. I absolutely loved this. I will give the victory to Heady Topper in a head-to-head, but its pretty much splitting hairs at that point. World class, top notch. Unbelievable."
"Overall: Hill Farmstead makes as good of a beer as anyone out there, and they're doing it with such a wide variety of recipes. This is another killer beer in their lineup - I wouldn't say it's better than Ephraim, but it's up there. I'm off to the Alchemist in an hour for some Heady Topper, and Abner is one heck of a baseline for comparison. Bottom line - if you like a grapefruit tasting DIPA, I don't think you'e going to do much better than Abner."
"Overall a surprising and uniquely balanced 2x IPA."
"In their short existance, the Hill Farmstead Brewery has seemed to master the art of creating hoppy beers, and this example is proof of that. Outstanding work. I cannot wait to see what comes next."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer as I have heard a lot about it. A top tier DIPA, but it (for me) falls short of the heavyweights in this class. Still, a really, really tasty beer that is very, very good. Really glad I got to try it."
"Note: Should add that I had this with a cave aged soft cheddar that I bought at the festival. Paired terrifically!"
"Pours a cloudy lemony amber color with a thinnish white head that seems to dissipate quickly. Smells like hops, no really it does :) Earthy spicy hops abound with that spicy oniony flair to them. Little if any malt evident in the aroma, but I'm sure they did indeed use some malts in this beer. Taste is Bitter pine and earthy. Hints of caramel malt are there for a nano second but this one is all about the hops. Finishes rather dry with a long lingering spicy bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium thin body with a resinous tart mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one, but it wasn't my favorite of the night. One curiosity is that all of the Hill beers I had were very cloudy, not sure if that is the way they are supposed to be or if we had trouble pouring."
"O: This brewery never ceases to amaze with its' hop forward offerings. Another great beer."
"Overall, this is an extremely solid an delicious iipa. This is welcome in my glass any day."
"The beer is yellowish to orange in color, and mildly hazy. The head is a finger or so thick and leaves a healthy amount of lacing upon the glass. The aroma...ah. Wonderful. A barrage of tropical citrus fruits, most notably mango, pineapple, and orange, fill the olfactory senses with a hop lover's dream come true. While the flavor doesn't quite live up to the expectations delivered by the superb aroma, this beer is delicious nonetheless. Remarkably drinkable and wonderfully smooth on the palate. Highly recommended."
"This is a touch thinner than I expect a DIPA to be, as it doesn't leave the sticky hop oils on my palate. To be sure though, this is the king of HF Double IPAs. However, given the different characteristics of each, I wonder at what would happen if I blended the two..."
"Cheers!"
"Medim bodied with a blast of dry, dank, earthy hops up front with hints of pine and dry bitterness balanced by a sweet tropical/ citrus fruit presence.  Fuller bodied than expected and slightly creamy with hints of papaya ,lots of grapefruit and orange peel as well as some mango.  Dry, dank earthy hop presence balanced by the citrus.  Really dry and bitter at first but as the glass warms it becomes extremely well balanced with a ton of citrus and tropical fruit notes."
"The drinkability was never in question. My first taste of anything from HF and hopefully not my last A+++"
"O: The nose is great, and this would be an A+ beer if not for the overpowering bitterness. I am a hophead, but this one almost pushes the envelope to far. But all in all another very good beer from HF. Skal."
"O - Easy to drink and tempting to drink more than one. It is one of the crisper DIPAs."
" Not too harsh, but yet harsh. Strong but not upfrontly so. this was a killer dipa that i was glad i opened up!"
"O: A definite top 10 DIPA, closer to the top of the list. For such a big beer this is crazy drinkable. Sadly, I’ve had better, but not many. (It’s tough to be Younger). Thanks again Michael!"
"Overall a fantastic beer. Really nice hoppy flavor and aroma. If only the carbonation was present like it should be. I gotta try this and other Hill Farmstead IPA's. I could see this being my top rated DIPA if I could try it again."
"O - I enjoyed this one quite a bit but when you compare it to the other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers it is clearly fourth or fifth best. Not knocking it one bit as it is still an awesome beer, just not as good as either of the Citra's or even Edward."
"HV"
"I like this beer too. Thinner than Kryptonite but not watery, the bitterness is spot on, no malt up front with a nice palate of great great pine, earth and citrus hops. Most drinkable out fo the bunch for sure."
"O - Really, really impressed with this one! Its like Masala Mama meets Pliny, and then they go over to their cousin Abrasive's house for dinner. Really well balanced, smells great and tastes even better. Home run for Hill Farmstead! Looking forward to more of their offerings in the future. Thanks again Ben for this mighty treat!"
"Well done Hill Farmstead! This is my 2nd favorite of your beers-- Edward is my giant #1!"
"D: Drank the shit out of this beer. Potentially dangerous at 8.2%. Don't expect to have this much given the limit distribution of Hill Farmstead but I would order whenever given the chance"
"The beer pours a somewhat hazy orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is impressive, though it doesn't compare to Ephraim or the double cirtra. Still, I get considerable dry citrus, pepper and light pine on the nose. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this dry, impressively hoppy IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fairly long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well disguised in what is another outstanding IPA from the folk at FH. Excellent beer, but I thought it paled in comparison to some of its sibling at this event."
"Pored into my pint glass. Golden honey color with three full fingers of foam head. Lacing is evident. Big citrus fruit on the nose. Carbonation is light to medium. Very light hop bite. Taste lots of grapefruit for me. I won't say I was underwhelmed by this, but I will say this was my least favorite beer I've tried from Hill Farmstead. Good beer, but not stunning."
"Looks like a HF IPA. Color is a hazed, murky dull golden copper with a bubbly white head from a hard pour. Adequate retention and minimal lacing, suggesting this wasn't the best growler fill. Aroma is dank pine and citrus resin with biscuit malt and minimal sweetness. Very fresh and intense. Much more sweetness in the flavor which goes a long way in balancing the intense resiny bitterness and making this beer enjoyable. Hops start tropical and juicy before turning dry, raw and piney in the finish. Carbonation is a little low given this a growler, but not as bad as I expected upon initially opening. Thick, chewy and syrupy this a much denser and filling beer than my other favorite VT DIPA at the moment, Double Sunshine. In my opinion, consistently the best east coast DIPA for those seeking an intense hoppy and resiny fix."
"the quality of a pliny on the east coast... crisp and complex with a broad not syrupy grain note. pour is golden with a white head. nose is a fruit and cannabis, apple, passionfruit and honey notes. palate is citrus complex sugars of fruit with a brisk ender and a hint of earthy bitterness. this is a summer DIPA that could be had in the middle of a hot day and would leave one feeling lethargic. this is sort of impossible... with that said. a total success."
"O: I've had some great IPAs/DIPAs, but this is hands down the best I've had to date and easily one of the best overall beer's I've ever tossed back. Picture perfect appearance, a nose so good I want to take a shower in it, use it as cologne, spray it on my beds sheets, capture it in a bottle and carry it everywhere with my nose constantly propped against it. The scary part? The taste is even BETTER! How could this be possible! 9 times out of time a great nose on an IPA is led by a letdown of some degree or at least matches the nose. Rarely does it beat the nose. Never does it beat an epic nose. The body? It defies logic."
"Everything I have tasted from Hill Farmstead has been good to excpetional.."
"Drinkability/overall - Dangerously drinkable for 8.2%, very well done DIPA that can run with the big boys."
"orange colored (slightly cloudy) with weak white head. strong hoppy notes in the smell, more with citrus than anything else with hints of fruit. Light and refreshing taste. grapefruit undertones and more tropical fruit in the background. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Alcohol is nonexistent. Very nice DIPA."
"I could drink this all the time any day, and I love how it feels goij down. Abner all the way. H&F all the way. Hype machine? Validated."
"DB- Love the citrus and peaches here. As a whole it is a very well balanced double IPA and I am only awaiting Ephraim to find out how that could possibly be much better than this. Vermont is really becoming a powerhouse of Northeast craft beer."
"Damn! Vermont knows their hops! This is definitely comparable to Heady Topper."
"D - very balanced and drinkable. Great beer"
"Drinkability- Really tasty brewski here. I've tried a lot of IPA's over the years and I love when I get to try something a bit different than all the rest and it still manages to be really good. Not sure what the hop profile of this beer is but it reminds me of Kern River Citra and some of those Troegs Scratch IPA's - except good. Very enjoyable, thanks much Jeff!!"
"Medium body and carbonation, sticky and dry with an unusual yet pleasing creaminess on the palate with lingering feel. Drinks really well, the alcohol is nonexistent, and the flavors balance out nicely from top to bottom. This was my first beer from Hill Farmstead and I cannot wait to try another one."
"Overall: Aside from the mouthfeel, I thought this was stellar. I guess Citra hops were substituted for Centennial in this batch, and they certainly leave their mark. It's ridiculously smooth and drinkable, and the hop aroma and flavor are excellent."
"Thanks to jedwards for sharing. Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy caramel with a frothy, half inch, milky head that dissipates into a bubbly skim. Small spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, a floral character and light toasted malts. Taste is earthy and floral with some light bittering at the finish. There's also a slightly tart and herbal quality in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, crisp carbonation. I have to say that I found Abner to be really quite tasty and interesting, and one of the best domestic Farmhouse Ales I've had to date. That being said, I'm a bit surprised to see it characterized as a DIPA. Nonetheless, regardless of the style, it has great complexity and flavor. A truly wonderful beer."
"D: Hopefully all of the Hill Farmstead IPAs are similarly well done. Even with the alcohol content where it is, this is a dangerously easy to drink beer."
"Big thanks to Sean for hooking this one up at growlerfest part one. Poured into a Lost Abbey tumbler, a burnt orange, slightly hazy, with a small off white bubbly head that sits at the edge of the glass. Huge grassy hop aroma, slightly resinous with a light straw like malt, only a hint of sweet malt. Taste is very hoppy and bitter, big grassy hops, pine resin, slightly earthy, some citrus, malty bread crust, some biscuit malts, sweet finish. Medium bodied with a light carbonation. A decent DIPA, but for the most part is just seems like a doubled up version of edward, which I prefer to this one."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, not my favorite DIPA ever, just slightly too sugary, but this is a good one that you can put down easily enough."
"D - Abner is a really juicy hop bomb that hides his alcohol quite well. Great first impression of this brewery!"
"**Edit. After having this on draft several times at the anniversary party I believe this is the best DIPA available."
"D - I think Ephraim in the better DIPA, but this one is very solid. Very easy to drink, as I had a couple of glasses. Recommend!"
"This is an above average dipa, I'd have again on tap."
"D - Fairly sessionable for an Imperial IPA. I liked this much better than the version I had on-tap at American Flatbread in Burlington, which tasted like Dogfish 90 Minute (which I also enjoy, but only when super-fresh). I'd certainly have this again, but I prefer Edward."
"Pours a super-hazy golden with a solid two finger head. Nose is blasted by grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, and hint of floral. This is like sticking my nose in a hop bag. The taste is perfectly balanced. There's a nice honey lemon sweetness up front, but the finish has a solid battering of bitter hops. This is pretty full bodied, but beautiful light carbonation. I couldn't slow down drinking of this brew. Hands down one of the best double IPAs I've ever had."
"Thanks Steve!"
"Arrived in a snifter glass glass with no visible head. Nice bright peach color when I held it up to the light. A big blast of grapefruit, lemony citrus hops hits you instantly when smelling the beer, very nice. Taste has a lot of the grapefruit, lemon, orange again with a slight bit of pine. No hint of alcohol at all. Very tasty dipa. Great silky smooth mouth feel and perfect for the style in my opinion. I had 2 glasses and I would of had another couple if I had a DD with me. Very glad to finally try this beer and highly recommended. One of the best east coast ipa's for sure in my book."
"Huge thanks to Andrewinski1 for bringing this gem back from his Vermont trip. Four days old when we drank it! Can't beat that with a stick! The beer pours a hazy deep straw color with about a finger of creamy white head. The aroma is simply divine. Deep blood orange and tropical fruit in the aroma with a great bitter grassy hop aroma to round out the nose. Really a nice balance of bitter and sweet on both the nose and the pallet. The flavor is a lot what the nose would lead it to be. Sweet candied grapefruit zest and orange juice to the front and it finishes nicely with a complex hop flavor. Kind of a sweet caramel finish to this one. The feel is a nice medium body with good carbonation. I'm impressed at how well this held up in the growler. Overall, it's tough to get better than this one for me. I wish this was as available as Pepsi."
"This beer has very well integrated flavors that seem to take turns vying for attention. It is one of the most drinkable beers at this abv I have ever experienced."
"D: another great offering from HFS with no hops left behind"
"A bitter DIPA from the East, never in a million years did I think something on this level would be produced over here. Feel is bitter, medium, with enough malt to keep things in check, no problem on the carb, Im yearning for more. There are no coasts anymore, Abner is the one, go get it."
"The carbonation held up well (the growler was filled three days ago). The body is light to medium. This is syper drinkable. Hope I can make the trek back to Vermont soon."
"D- that's a god damn good beer. I'd go to say its up there with the best and I've had the best. Baller as hell and so fucking drinkable. I'm in awe of this beer."
"Overall, a very drinkable, tasty IIPA."
"The flavor is nice with orange juice and a bit of rind. Some very light grapefruit as well. A touch of pine and spruce in the finish, which is nice and dry. Good carbonation levels and a nice bitterness. A really tasty brew. Thanks again, Shaun."
"Thank you."
"Growler brought back from autumn fest- thanks Scott!!! Pours a bright, clear orange with a thin white head. Smells like HOPS!!! Tons of citrus. Good god, like a west coast gem, but from the VT!!!! Taste is similar - a nice citrusy start but with a fairly bitter finish. Just wonderful! Thin, light mouthfeel. Can't wait to get more of this, along with the other HF beers!"
"Wow, just another fantastic hopped-up offering here from Hill Farmstead, with bold hop flavors, impeccable balance, and a ridiculous drinkibility for the size. This took a little bit to work its magic on me but once I got into that second glass, I was a believer. I hate to sound like a full-blown mark for this new brewery, but man, I really do think that these beers are that good."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker."
"Overall I really like it. I'll try this one again."
"Drinkability is great. This is one tasty DIPA. Lots of hops, some citrus notes and a good malt backbone to hold it all together without taking away from the hops. Shaun has done a great job with this beer and Vermont is really stepping up their game in the DIPA department. With Head Topper from the Alchemist, Hopzilla from Lawson's and now Abner, I think California has some good competition. Definitely grab a growler of this if you can. Highly recommended."
"Super clean and wonderfully bitter, but balanced. The 8.2 is hidden like a Westy 12 in a carry-on bag. Dank and delightful. Well done, Shaun!"
"Well-balanced and subtle. It takes skill to make this style enjoyable from the tap and nothing is spared in the end result. Rivals the Alchemist."
"On tap at the grand opening. Pours a dark golden color with hints of orange, slightly hazy. Piney hops in the nose with a hint of malt. High hop bitterness backed up by some body and high hop flavor; slight grassy/vegetal notes. Alcohol is somewhat hidden but detectable. Finishes well and hops linger on the tongue. Tasty and enjoyable, but not quite as complex as Edward, IMO."
