"Stone really knows how to put em out, quality to the 10th (pun?) degree every-time, wish it was year round though.."

"This beer was good and it reminded me of a barleywine. It's definitely a big beer. I'll gladly partake in this one again."

"On tap at Randy Jones Sports Grill. Very hoppy with strong bitter finish. Smells of grass and orange."

"Really dark taste. The alcohol taste overwhelms the taste of hops. I feel like I can breath fire."

"If I had them both before me, I would rate the second and first batches against each other.  As it is, I am doing this from memory.  The first batch was phenomenal, but the later batches were so-so.  My rating reflects both at the same time."

""

"One of the best IPAs out there. Thank you Stone."

"absolutely hands down my favorite beer. perfect color, aroma filled with delightful dankness with a nice bite on the front end followed up with a fruit/ pine bitterness you would expect from a double. from me its a 5 all the way"
""

""
""
"Had on tap, poured into a tulip glass. Has a nice amber color with a cream colored head. You can smell the huge amount of hops in this brew. The mouth feel is sharp and bitter. There is the hint of malt in the background, just enough to bring out all of those hops. The taste is California, citrus and tropical fruits, there is a hint of spice and pine. A very good sipping  beer not over powering at 10.5 percent. Cheers"

"Beautiful balance of hops and malts. Citrus floral notes and chewy attributes while still posting a strong caramel malt backdrop; this one delivers."

"Poured a 5-month old bomber into a willy glass.  A slightly hazy copper-rose with orange hints - a very pretty beer.  Small slightly off-white head that dissipates and leaves minimal lace.  The aroma is floral, dank and resinous.  Taste follows smell with thick resin combined with floral spice and caramel malt.  A delicious beer that maintains its fresh hoppiness as it warms and aerates.  Mouthfeel is perfect for a double IPA.  Overall, this is a wonderful beer from Stone."

"O: I couldn't believe the taste of this one, It was like drinking three beers in one. I loved the way it changed from start to finish on each sip as well as each glass. They also do a great job of covering of the big ABV."

"There's a great piney orange aroma on this, laced with a hint of tangerine and some candied orange sweetness. It comes off incredibly bitter, with layers of citrus and some resiny flavor. This is a good one."

"Hazy orange body with a big white fluffy head. Slightly old at 3 months, but hoping it is still good. Huge malty earth aroma. Some pine smell. Very smooth. I do wonder if the hops have tapered off some because it is more malty and less hoppy than I thought it’d be, but still tastes great. Good amount of sweetness, but still quite bitter. My guess fresh this is great. Today I think it is very good."

"Big props to Stone for this one. If you've ever had a Ruination, just amp that up with a higher APV and more hops to the taste buds! Love this beer. Well balanced for a big hop beer. Very dry just like a ruin(your palate)ation should be. Well done. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a big hop IPA. ENJOY!"

"The aroma and appearance may not be perfect (damn good but not perfect) but this beer is just excellent! Flavor's Richlv malti-sweet & that balances nicely with the power of big hops and just the right carbonic tang. Perfect body and finish. Great drinking beer just got to be careful I don't get zonked on it."

"Starts with a decent malt base and the hop that comes in the swallow isn't altogether surprising, but its strength is far stronger than I expected.  Very warming to the throat.  Long bitter aftertaste.  Neutral body with an above average carbonation.   4.25 3.75 4.25"

"To put it simple this beer is a 5/5 till it warms up. The high ABV is more dominant once the beer warms so it is best enjoyed cold. Once it warms up it becomes a 4.75/5. This is still an amazing beer to try. This company continues to produce quality beverages."

"I love this beer!   There are only a handful of great IPA ' that I have had the pleasure of drinking,  and this is one of them.   Rich color and gorgeous head.  A powerful aroma and a great finish.  Even with the big APV, it doesn't have an overwhelming alcohol feel"

"I normally would break this beer down, but this time, it broke me. It has it all. Color, aroma, mouthfell, flavor, complexity...I have enjoyed a lot of beers, this was one to savor, it has it all. A hop bomb with the perfect malt balance. Every sip was outstanding, and more enjoyable than the last. One the most enjoyable beers I have had, and I want another. I enjoy Stone offerings, cannot tell you how much I appreciated this one. Definitely top 5, maybe top 3. Get it, you will love it, if not send it to me......."

"Went over to a friends house one night.There where four of us and we went to costco and much to my pleasant surprise was a four pack of stone brews.The regular ipa,ruination,arrogant bastard and the ruin 10.They let me have the Ruin 10 because it was the only one i had not tried.What a great brew.I have to say I like Ruination alittle better but this is no slouch.With a ABV of 10.80 in a 22oz Bomber it got the job done.Very nice Hoppy flavor with a nice smell.If you are lucky enough to find those four packs grab 2 before they run out.You just can`t go wrong with Stone and this is no exception.Keep on Rockin the better beers.Motley Drunk out."
""
"I remember the first time I tried (the original) Ruination, I thought it was an unbalanced mess of hops and not at all enjoyable. (though based on the BA reviews there are a lot of people who think otherwise) The flavors here are very clear and concise. The result is a pretty impressive brew, though to call it more balanced might be a joke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- First of all, Ruination is one of my favorite beers on Earth. I know Ruin Ten came out exactly as the people at Stone intended. I know they're more man than me and that I am not worthy. I loved the look, smell, and feel, but the overall flavor was just too bitter for me. Each flavor was huge and the quality was evident, but the balance was tilted far too heavily in favor of the bitterness for my poor palate. And again, I'm sure that was the point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky copper with solid carbonation rising from the depths.  Smells fantastic!  Sweet pine all the way.  Taste was strong pine / floral with heavily crisp after taste.  Coats your whole mouth and leaves a dry oasis after each sip.  Alcohol is moderately present in this DIPA.  Reminiscent of Anderson Valley Heelch O' Hops.  A big favorite for a lot of beer drinkers out there but a little much for me.  Worth the price of admission but won't get my hand stamped on the way out..."
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - A very drinkable beer, smooth, with a great aftertaste. If only they sold 12-ounce bottles!"
""
""
""
"Pours a clear bright copper with about two big fingers of head that linger for quite some time and leave nice lacing behind. The nose is both floral and hoppy. The malt profile is bolder than most DIPAs. The hoppiness is simply intense. The only downside is that the alcohol burn pokes out a tad too much on the finish. There is also an odd sweet fruity taste on the finish."

"This beer is a palate wrecker. Hugely hopped and very enjoyable if you want the hoppiest thing possible."

"I have been drinking this beer for numerous years, and this is the first time I have taken the time to sit down and really appreciate the beer. For me, there isn't anything to dislike about this beer. I'm in love again..."

"Mouthfeel is really good. Big, bold, flavorful, with a full body and a nice long lingering finish. Layers of flavor adding lots of complexity. Well carbonated providing a slightly lighter body to a getting close to heavy beer. Heavily effects both sweet and bitter taste buds. Starts off bold with a sticky sweet start, not completely but fairly smooth with a oily bitter finish. Slight warming effect from the alcohol. Overall and absolutely delicious well rounded full beer. Another home run from Stone. I'm glad it was brewed again, I missed out last year. If this is coming out every summer (which is what I hear), then I will try to seek it out."

"Thanks again stone for your WONDERFUL take on yet, ANOTHER practically perfect beer."
"O- Wow this beer definitely impresses, huge malt profile but the hops still manage to shine on the back end. Definitely a hearty sipper of a beer. Honestly left me somewhat speechless on the review as I spent more time just sitting back and enjoying each sip for everything that it is rather than put a lot of thought into breaking it down.."

"Overall - This is a great beer, definitely one of my favorites, out of my favorite beer style (double ipa) I really would recommend this beer to anyone who likes strong ipas, its expensive (8.99 for a bomber) and really that detracts more from the high overall I gave it. But at the end of the day you pay for what you get and what you're getting is a top notch beer... seriously, go buy it and try it now! I promise you that you'll have no regrets."

"Clear, deep orange with a dense cream/beige cap. Sticky foam, good head retention. Hoppy aroma, lots of citrus, grapefruit rind, a bit of pine, some caramel, slightly herbal with a hint of spicy/onion character. A big IPA with plenty of sweetness to balance the bitterness and hop flavour, more caramel and citrus mostly, along with some booziness in the finish. Full bodied, med/low CO2, nice texture. Overall, quite tasty."

""
""
""
""

"Brass colored with excellent clarity. A quarter inch of eggshell white head rests on top. Light Brussels lacing. Pungent aroma of citrus hops smell of mango and pineapple. The taste is extremely bitter with intense citrus and tropical hops. Vegetal tasting hops dominate the front and the back of the palate. There's substantial light malt in there,but this is clearly a hop bomb. The mouth is thick,somewhat syrupy, and carbonated."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This pours out a hazy golden orange color with a dense layer of foam and excellent lacing. It's sitting about a foot away from me and the aroma is wonderful from here. Picking it up and sniffing, delicious notes of fruity citrus and fresh pine resin. Flavor is bracingly bitter, but backed by a big maltiness. Loads of hop flavor last through the drink and linger after the dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a high 4.25 borderline 4.5. Look forward to this every summer and tough to beat this for $8.99 bomber. One of Stone's best."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprise, surprise, surprise... Stone has done it again. An absolutely magnificent beer. An ode to the glory of the hops and definitely not for the faint of heart. RuinTen is a beast that demands respect and earns it with relative ease in just a few sips. A mandatory must-try for hopheads. I'm dying to try this bottled, as well."
""
""
"O: sadly this is only a yearly release. One I wish I could get more often. The beer hops to its reputation. It's an absolute hop animal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall,for a one time shot, I liked it but if the next year's tastes like this -No dice!"
"Not beautiful looking but otherwise a great beer.As with most Stone IPAs, scent is piney and grassy, but I find this one a bit more restrained. Taste is similar with a touch of sweet maltiness.What makes this beer a cut above most of the rest is the creamy mouthfeell that seems unusual for IPAs. This is a fantastic beer and I'm consistently impressed with Stone and their piney versions of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep clear amber. Minimal white head leaves some moderate lacing. The aroma is not overwhelming but has some nice depth with rich caramel malt tones balancing the aggressive hopping. The taste amplifies the aroma and is delicious. It is lighter bodied but not thin and is an excellent example of an imperial IPA."
""
""
" Overall: Not as mind blowing as my first Stone Ruination several years ago, but still robust as far as DIPAs go!"

""
""
""
""
"Brilliant copper orange in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a thick, cream colored foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left a trace of sticky lacings on the glass. Rip grapefruit, tropical fruit, and sticky sweet malt aromas with floral hop and boozy notes. Medium bodied with subdued carbonation and a slick oily feel. Intense flavor of ripe pineapple, grapefruit, and orange rind with a sticky sweet caramel backbone. Tangy floral hop flavors through the middle that transition to boozy, light pine hop flavors at the end. Finished with lingering floral and pine hop flavors and a definitive booziness. An all time new favorite."

"a textbook west coast ipa, a towering beer, a colossus if you will (and oh, you will!). crystal clear, uncommon in big hoppy beer, no hop or chill haze, and just a fluffy white head, far too delicate for the liquid beneath it. pine aromatics fill the room when i pour the bottle out, carbonation creeps up, and fresh cut christmas tree dominates. other citrusy characters are there in the nose too, but this is a resin bomb, somehow clean though, the whole thing is like an ipa i have had a billion times before, just made quite a bitter better than basically all of them. its so creamy at first sip, too gentle for how intense the hops are, and bitterness is only average. its layers of citric and sappy hops, west coast glory, but delicate and drinkable, scary drinkable really for what it is. this is a better first beer than a last beer in a session, and for all the hopped up stuff stone does, this may be their crowning achievement. clean feel and finish, just enough bubbles, and a medium but fresh and lingering body. its a number of paradoxes all wrapped into one neat affordable package. i have been a fan of stone for a long time, but i am now convinced that this is the best of their portfolio. cant believe it took me this long to get into one. wow! an absolute must for the ipa fan, not to be missed under any circumstances. true brewing magic."
""

"Overall: Awesome beer that got better as it warmed up. Hops died down and the malts and booze warmed up."

""
""

"Overall: this beer is a hop bomb. The spiciness in the taste and finish are excellent. The fruit, usually dominant in a West Coast DIPA, is not as prominent. This beer is about hops."

"if you like IPA's this is one of the best, I am hoppy they put this out yearly. It is the epitome of a West Coast IPA. Thick, Dank, Resiny, and citrusy. I look forward to this every time it is released forget the Enjoy By, this is the one you want! I am not one who can break down ten aromas, or flavors in every beer, but I know what I think is good and fits the style, and for me this is about as good as it get for IPA's that I can get in my area. If you get Stone I would definitely recommend this as a must buy from them."

"O: This is easily my favorite Stone beer. It's a big, over-the-top monster like any good triple IPA should be, without being too sugary/boozy. It also manages to never become overwhelming (instead dancing on that razor's edge between extreme and moronic perfectly). This beer is perfect as a once-a-year release - I couldn't drink it very often, but I'd still enjoy the fuck out of it during its narrow release window."

"What a DIPA! I narrowly missed out on this one the first time around so I was very happy to get another shot."

"O-Overall an awesome DIPA love this beer way to go Stone!"
"This is a surprisingly balanced and drinkable beer for its big ABV. Don't let the bottle scare you off; the hop presence in this beer is significant but controlled, almost exactly like drinking hop tea would not be. I wasn't especially impressed."

"Ruination cranked up to a ten, sign me up. The pour was typical IPA amber, body clear, carbonation gentle, and the head spare. The smell was loaded with grapefruit and was so intoxicating, it made me hold it up to my nose for several seconds at a time. The taste was beyond perfect in the hop assault, as the grapefruit was concentrated into a strong tonic. In addition to the citrus fruit, I could also sense flavors of butterscotch, pineapple, and strawberry. The body was dense, sticky, and oily, leaving a coating of hops in place of the original mucous that had been stripped off my tongue. The finish was spicy and boozy. I got this at Green's just a month from bottled on date, and it was oh so splendidly fresh."

"Overall, a very tasty DIPA that showcases very fruity, tropical aromatics and flavors. I would recommend anyone that loves hops try this one out. Not as awesome as 'Enjoy By', but still a great beer for any hophead."
""
""
""
""
"Pours crystal clear amber with minimal head. Nose is tropical fruit, but still has piney notes. First sip reveals some tropical fruit, mango or papaya. Perfectly bitter all the way. Lasts a while on the palate. Good body. Delicious IPA that is a good reflection of what Stone is all about."
""
""
""
""
""
"ReReview: Just had this on tap and was amazing. The taste was so different from what I remember. It had a lot of malt backbone to it and was delicious. I'm up more original taste score from a 4 to a 4.5"
""
""
"O - a great stone double IPA. Definitely more full bodied than the Enjoy By. Different in its own right but just as good."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/9/2014. Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly sticky/crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA. All around awesome complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; and very smooth and fairly crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Easily one of the best “triple” IPAs out there and quite possibly the best hoppy beers accessible on the shelves."

""

"O- RuinTen gives Enjoy By IPA a run for its money! Although two totally different hop profiles, I will give the nod to RuinTen as a result of the heftier malt backbone...the hop-to-malt balance is just perfect making it that much more drinkable considering the ABV (and the labeled, 10.8% ABV does not disappoint)! However, RuinTen does not remind me so much of its in genesis in Ruination IPA. Although still dank, oily and resinous, Ruination has a black tea component in the aroma and flavor that does not translate in RuinTen...the latter replaces that essence with that of a tropical (i.e. passionfruit) vibe courtesy of the addition of Citra in the dry hop. However, three years since their initial Ruination anniversary brew (of which preceded Enjoy By IPA), this stands to be my favorite of the lot. (4.75)"

"Notes: Incredible for 10% abv. Very well balanced. My very first craft beer was an Arrogant Bastard and I couldn’t believe a beer could be that wild. Stone has not stopped doing that to beer."
""
""
""
"O - Hadn't come across this yet, so I was pretty stoked to see it (especiallly this fresh, thanks Robert). Not quite over the top on the hops...(edit) after the 2nd glass, I have determined it IS over the top with the hops, which is fine with me. It is well put together beer and highly drinkable for the ABV."

"Had this beer the last two times it came out and it was great 4.5+ beer…However to sum this 3rd release installment up is plain and simple. The grain bill is completely taking over this beer and the hops are not nearly as balanced this go around, mostly all pine and subtle citrus in smell and taste. To much malt is adding a unbalanced sweet taste that does not mesh well with the hops."
""
""
""
""
"O: Will admit, I'm a huge fan of this beer -- but really, it's excellent all-around. Packs a huge punch, but goes down fairly smooth. Smell and taste are nearly perfect. It's an excellent brew that puts most double IPAs to shame."

"Massive floral hops immediately greet the nose. Aromas that follow are tropical fruits, mango, papaya, buttery biscuit, caramel and deep malts. Copper appearance with a thin foam rim and big alcohol legs. Taste is extremely bitter hops upfront, subsiding into tangerine, mango, orange, tropical fruits, big buttery caramel and biscuit malts. Finish is extremely dry with more bitter hops and moderate booze. Overall, what else can I say? It's an already amazing beer but, even more amped up. Ruinten is Ruinten; and Ruinten is damn good stuff."

"Poured into snifter with a good solid half inch of white head.  Orange copper color and very transparent with slight amount of bobbles.  Smells like a hop explosion with some citrus in the background.  Very hoppy bitter beer with a strong boozy taste and sweet taste of pineapple and some type of citrus.  Medium body and carbonation.  Fantastic beer!"

"Pow! Juicy grapefruit hops of destruction. It lingers and it's dank. It's a sensation i last recall when first trying regular Ruination when i was newer to craft brews. I didnt care much for the aftertaste then. Now, having tried numerous IPAs of many shades, i can say i now enjoy the deal better. Big beer, big taste. Bitter pine is juicy when massive hops are used. It is here, and i find it delicious."

"The thing with this beer is to try and describe something wrong with it.. And I can't. Alcohol is hidden perfectly yet you can feel the warming but it's so pleasing. The bitterness is a lot sure but it fits in with the orange, citrus, grapefruit flavors perfect. Let's just say I feel like my life will be fulfilled the day I have this on draft."
""
"O- Really like this beer. Supposedly has 50/50 Citra and Centennial but I have to say the Citra really seems to steal the show, not that I'm complaining. A really big beer that is also surprisingly smooth to me. This beer is right up there with some of the most aromatic IPAs that I've had."

"UPDATE 7/19/14: The 2014 version is extremely and dangerously sippable. This bottle sealed 6/0?/14 ( a blank space after the zero for the day). Not much of a head to speak of this time, but the taste is still awesome, and although the bitterness builds somewhat in the back of the mouth, it does not linger annoyingly. Remains one of my personal top-rated DIPAs, but I am reducing the appearance rating from 4.5-3.75 for the disappointingly nearly non-existent head, the smell rating from 4.5-4 since citrus is less evident, and the mouthfeel rating from 4.5-4 because it seems less exceptionally smooth now."
""

"On draft at The Top in Gainesville. Tapped today! (Also have had bottled, and enjoyed the bottle more--final score is for the bottle version). Pours copper golden and clear with a small white head. Massive grapefruit aroma with huge floral aromatics. Big slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation (on the low side for an IPA). Flavor of pine hops, very fresh. Some grapefruit and definite floral hop flavor. A bit of malt backbone here, but highlights the bitter as a Ruin(beer) should. Missed out on this last year and glad they brought it back. More flavor than regular ruination, but playing second fiddle to Enjoy By. Good stuff."

"*Update: On the second day this brew really evened out with the malts becoming a little more apparent. In this case being not-so-fresh made it more enjoyable.*"

"It pours orange-copper with busy carbonation leading up to a long lasting moderate head. The aroma has a big piney hop character as well as a definitive butterscotch buttery maltiness and some tropical fruits. Very interesting and worth a decent grade. The body is medium to bold with an astringent texture. The taste also has this butterscotch undercurrent along with the biting hop bitterness that lingers and languishes at the end."

"Mouthfeel-Solid and bready enough to stand up to all the hops and alcohol. Overall- If you like bland, fizzy water, this is NOT your beer! It's huge, 'in-your-face' hopiness is perfect for when you want the beer to be the main course in any meal. I'm lucky enough to live near Stone, and this will be in my fridge whenever it's available. It's a top 5 in the Imperial IPA category for me."

"RuinTen is well named. This beer is a DIPA fan’s delight. Bad taste in your mouth? Then drink one of these bad boys (I can’t imagine more than one bomber per sitting), and it’ll be long gone. Not a session beer at all, but a great stand alone."

""

"Appearance - Light copper rustic crystal clear hue with a white head that leaves lace all over the glass. Aroma - Caramel malt is quickly over taken by sweet orange peel, pine needles and some tropical fruit. Taste - Sweet caramel malt with pine, orange peel, with a big resin mouth feel. Strong bitterness on the back of the tongue to finish this palate killer."

"Poured a clearish auburn brown body some decent head and lace. Very hoppy aroma, natch, get my piney citrus and grape feel as well as a sturdy malt backbone. Yes this is a hop bomb that tastes like it smells but I really liked this one because while dry and somewhat of a tastebud nuker, to be honest, I got a medium-bodied beer with good hops and some sweet fruit hop and sweet malt flavorings. The amount of sweetness and balanced packed into this beer is quite unexpected. A sweeter than most DIPA that can still pack a hop wallop is just fine with me and glad I tried this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall , Amazing !!! complex flavor but a good double ipa , I'm a late Stoner, so this is a real treat for me . Between the smell , and this explosion on the mouth as the bottle reads a mosh pit of hops, is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruin Ten poured a deep orange amber with plenty of off white head and hop aromas exploded out of the bottle. The taste grabbed my taste-buds with a full frontal assault of hops and took me for a ride through all the hop hues. There was pine followed by bitter grapefruit and citrus with floral and tropical fruit notes underneath that all end in a fresh resinous bite. The hops ride a subtle caramel tone that enhances the fruity undertones as it warms. This is a truly exceptional beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright hop flavors throughout. Not as bitter as regular ruination, a lot more balance here from the high malt content. Lots of bitter citrus peel flavors throughout this beer. While the beer has more balance than ruination, there is still a lot of building bitterness. Pine and grapefruit, very classic west coast ipa flavors with lots of sticky sweetness beneath it all to balance. Finishes with a touch of alcohol heat. I think I prefer regular ruination. Definitely a palate ruiner and wont really go with most foods but it's good. Not as special as I thought it would be though. Malt adds a stickyness that takes away from the hops just a bit unlike something like a terrapin hopzilla."

"Can be a bit cloying, but overall a good beer."

" Overall: Wow; this is a really impressive beer. It's not subtle in it's delivery which makes it much easier to discern the different elements. The lighter body makes it surprisingly drinkable, whereas the big malty mouthfeel and alcohol burn on the finish backs you down."

"22oz bottle. 2013 Edition. Pours a clear copper with a rigid and slightly off-white colored head. This leaves behind rich sudsy lacing that sticks. The aroma has a strong herbal and piney presence with some underlying zesty green citrus character. Bready malt is pronounced along the back and gives this some thickness in the nostrils. The herbal flavors get stronger as this warms. The taste is sweet (and a little boozy) with malt and warmth. Heady herbal flavors drive this but there are some more aggressive notes of resins and fresh bitterness that run down the middle of the tongue and really hang in the finish. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a slick creamy feel and a bit of crispness that pops in the mouth. That alcohol is strong here, even getting a little stinging in spots. I really wanted to like this more but it ultimately just got to be a little too medicinal feeling with its boozy sweetness and strong herbal character."

"22oz brown bottle in to a snifter. The beer is a hazed orange/copper color with a white head that settled to a ring leaving some trails of lacing. The aroma is tropical fruits and makes me want to drink it. The taste is pure tropical fruit from start to finish with just enough malt to keep my tongue from going numb. It is medium bodied with mild carbonation and represents the style quite well."

"O: Still not as blown away by this as I was last year's original batch, but as is clear from my numbers, this is still great."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 9/12/13. Pours a bright yellow orange, with a beautiful one head, amazing retention and coats the glass with lace. Smell is huge pine, mango, tangerine, apricot, and grapefruit. Taste is all of that and punches you in the face with grapefruit in finish and lingers on the tongue. Body is large, plenty of life, a bit dry like its son, and very approachable for its heft. This isn't for everyone, but I love this beer! All self proclaimed hop head must try."

"Poured a nice clear amber with a half-finger off white head that looked quite nice. Scents of grapefruit, citrus, orange rind, pine, floral and grassy notes, sweet malt, and tropical fruit. An excellent nose, that entices you to begin drinking this wonderfully aromatic beer. Flavor is intense, beginning with beginning with strong grapefruit notes and citrus rind, moving into pine and grassy flavors, still maintaining the heavy grapefruit and citrus flavors, moderate flavors of resinous hops. There is a nice sweet malt backbone that stays throughout the sip and balances the hops. There is a noticeable alcohol presence and the finish is bitter, with a very bitter hop aftertaste. Excellent, a true hop bomb, but with a nice balance with sweet malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sticky hit with slight alcohol burn as well. A nice mouthfeel that burns just enough and is just right in the body to go down smooth, but still remain strong. A fantastic hop bomb DIPA, similar in many ways to the Enjoy By, but with a slightly heavier body and more malt and alcohol presence. The hops are also a bit more forward. Truly excellent and I am glad I was able to find a bottle."
""
""
"A delicious DIPA, hopheads must try this one."
""
""
""
""

" For the brewery who can lay claim as Luplin mad, they really need to be committed, to making this again."
"This is the Mecca for Hopheads - and where else can one taste """grassy pudding?""""
"Enjoyed, but don't see wanting to open a bomber every time. Would have again if on-tap or at least smaller sampling."
""
""
""
""
"The beer had a dark yellow color with a white foam head. Very crisp taste. I could taste chocolate or caramel. Then a very fruity flavor. This beer has a lot going on in the taste department. There is this very hoppy pine taste with this beer also. This is not the best beer I have had from Stones, but it is good."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – An awesome beer that hides the booze incredibly well. You'd never know this was close to 11% ABV. Also packs a good dose of hops. I'll pick up a bottle or two of this every time I see it."

"This id an across the board fantastic DIPA and has everything you would look for and expect from a good example of the style. Pours a rich, bright amber, very clear with a thin white head that slowly dissipated. Smell is huge with fresh lively hops, heavy malts, lemon, Carmel. Taste follows suit. Mildly sweet, honey and floral. Feel id moderate, a touch sticky from the sweetness, mild carbonation. Overall great IPA, and my second favorite stone offering to date, second only to Enjoy By."

"Taste offers tons of hops, sweetness, and bitterness right in your face. If you're a hop head, like me, this really hits the god damn spot and the 10.8% is hidden nicely. Just fantastic. Huge hops up front that flow to a smooth and bitter finish. Plenty or pine, resin, and some sweet citrus. Really enjoyable."

"Perhaps my favourite Stone beer thus far. Stunning!"
"O: Stone was a gateway brewery for me, from hop bombs to RIS. Then I (foolishly) began to ignore it in favor of newer, """more exciting""" newcomers. Upon moving to Texas from California, I began to crawl back...Enjoy By and this brew have made me hope that I am still worthy..."
"O - Big, bold and bitter, but has some balance. Just like a Stone IIPA should be."
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and citrus hops. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance and great hoppiness levels."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was a good beer to try, but not one I would seek out specifically. It seems a little bit one-dimensional and to me the bitterness overpowered some of the other hop qualities."
""
""
"O- Not bad for $8. Stone is always a solid performer, and they didn't disappoint once again. If you like hops, you will enjoy this flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This is one I'd have no problem drinking again. But really, its not something that is so amazing that I'd seek it out. Glad I bought the bottle and tried it, but nothing really all that mind blowing. Really good, but its not one of those beers that changes your world."
""
"All in all I thought this is a great DIPA. I wonder if this ought to be classified as a Triple IPA because the hops are just above and beyond what I expect from a good DIPA. The malt backbone is well-constructed and supports the bittering hops very well in this beer, so the drinking experience is very good. I continue to be impressed by Stone and what they have been doing with their beers, despite all the marketing they do produce excellent hoppy but well-balanced DIPAs that sell at a great value. I do think they could do more with the aromatic hops in this beer."

""
""
""
""

"Having it within the time frame, this brew is a much different animal. (for those wondering how it would hold up). Brew is extremely hop and alcohol forward, but it does have enough sweet caramel malt and fruit to create a bit more balance."

"O: I haven't had PtY or Heady Topper, but this (and last year's incarnation) is probably my favorite IIPA that I've had. Great job with this one Stone, it's a WINNER for sure."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy deep orange to amber color with a two-finger and creamy off-white head. Beautiful lacing left behind throughout. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops with honey and biscuit malt with pineapple esters. Flavor is heavy hops and bitterness with supporting sweet malt, fruity esters, resinous pine and a dry finish. Full body and moderate carbonation throughout. Overall, a very delicious hop bomb from Stone. This quickly became my favorite in addition to their Enjoy By IPA series."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good push of the envelope by Stone. I appreciate the pushing of the boundaries and making such a hop bomb that really puts the hops on the front of the stage. I want to say there is no malt flavor to get in the way of this onslaught of hops, but I know it is in there some where. Good job pushing the boundaries with this one, well done!"

"Solid gold with a thick, tight bubbled head. Aroma is thick with bright lemon, lime, and sugary grapefruit over fresh pine needles and flowery hops. A slight cookie sweetness is present, but it's mostly astringently hoppy with a whiff of alcohol. Seriously hop-forward flavor backed by a pale malt sweetness. Grapefruit, pine resin bitterness, pineapple, tangerine, and melon. Oooo tasty...and not too sweet at all, which I didn't expect. Aggressive, crisp, and surprisingly not too strong feeling either. I mean, it feels """big," but I enjoy it, and I should know to trust Stone with hoppy beers after years of proof. I remember drinking Ruination for the first time, now it almost seems tame in relation to what DIPAs have evolved to be, but this sort of brings back that """holy shit that's hoppy""" feeling."
""
"Big raw resinous pine dominates popping with some tropical fruit - mango. Finishes dry and bitter with the ghost of malt backbone disappearing into the back of your throat. A tasty brew with lots of flavor. It is a bit intimidating, a sipper, but good."
""
""
"Overall, a tasty DIPA, but when it comes to Stone-made DIPAs, I'll take Enjoy By. This one is just too much from the hop profiles and not enough balance."
"Ok, my third experience with this beer. Each time I have been having it, it gets better and better. Nothing negative to report about this beer. In fact if anything, the praise gets better and better. Absolutely nothing negative to say about this beer, except the bottle empties way too soon."

"A: Light copper in color, wispy head that stays around, some lacing along the edges of the glass, spectacularly clear – 3.75, S: Amazingly hoppy nose – tons of pine and pink grapefruit, slight tartness and hint of bubblegum, heaven for a hop head - 4.75, T: Extremely bitter, lemon rind and pith, some syrupy caramel that has little chance of balancing the beer against all the hops, alcohol burn is evident and a little off-putting – 3.25, M: Quite creamy and medium bodied – 3.50, D: Enjoyable beer but a little lopsided in true Stone hop obsessed fashion, recommended for a drink – 3.50"

"Why did they have to make it so delicious? It's so incredibly, amazingly good that I have trouble restraining myself from drinking it too fast. This is a dangerous high-ABV weapon to be used against lovers of hops like myself. It's the kind of beer I would see mirages of if I was lost in a desert and wandering deliriously across the dunes under a scorching sun. Thank goodness the ones I saw at the store were real. The best DIPA I've ever had? I think so, yes."
"O: I was expecting a little more from this beer. This is a big, mean DIPA, but a tad boozy and just didn't blow me away overall."
""
""
""
""
"O. I didn't know what to expect from this. I had heard so many different opinions. I love the aroma and I like malty IPAs, which this is and that was a pleasant surprise. Bitter as hell if that's your thing. All in all, good not great. Glad I had it, but I'll seek out other easily obtainable brews in the same style."

"Stone RuinTen IPA, 2013 Annual Release, 10.8% ABV, 110 IBU's. A - Brilliantly clear light golden with orange tinge, just enough bright white head. S - Incredible, Hops hops and more hops, lemon-orange oils, alcohol presence. T - Hop bitterness and alcohol burn dominate, malt doesn't seem to be able to catch up, very dry, some hidden citrus notes. O - Palate destroyer, abundance of hops is quite enjoyable, although light malt profile is no match for the high alcohol content, better as it warms."

"I fell in love with the concept of this beer after hearing about it, it's great let's reinvent Ruination and make it hoppier to meet the standards of today's palate. Pours a beautiful copper orange hue with big thickets of off white head, forms thick with lovely bubbles flowing forth. Aroma has big citric rind, dank resinous hops, floral and earth notes colliding this is a hop explosion of a beer I bought a case and shared half. Flavor juicy hops hit the palate with big malts colliding with the beer what a great experience hop resin in a bottle it's slick and oily through each sip, you almost have to love this if you're a true hop head. Everything about it screams Stone from the hop burps, to the intense mix of flavors that provide a beer experience I haven't had yet to the cohesive drinkability that I can't believe this beer is this easy to consume. I don't blink an eye it goes down smooth with every sip but at the same time there is raw intense hop flavors that most brewers haven't touched upon yet flowing across the palate it's extreme on more than one front excellent effort from a veteran in the craft brewing scene."

"Pours a bright, sunset orange color with an off white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Smells of lots of pineapple and grapefruit, grass, tons of floral, mango, papaya, resin. Not getting much malt and maybe a hint of booze. Taste starts with grapefruit and floral notes. The middle brings lots of sweetness, as well as some breadiness; however, this just barely mellows out the hops. The finish is very big, but still complex. Tons of tropical fruit notes like mango, papaya, and pineapple. Definitely used citra hops in this. Big resin notes and accompanying bitterness. Some earthiness and grassiness. Not much malt to speak of, as the abrasive bitterness covers up the breadiness. The hefty sweetness is necessary to somewhat calm the finishing flavors. Decent amount of booziness along with a warming sensation. Full body with an oily and slick mouthfeel. Just punches you in the face with abrasive, bitter hops. Not for everyone, but I definitely dig it."

"Wow is this a great beer. The best IPA and probably the best beer I ever tasted. Almost a 5 on appearance. In fact a 5 when first poured, but it probably is just as good as all my other alltime favorites. I would have gave this a 5 total without review but it is a little pricey. That said, to date the best beer I ever tasted. Full body, great pour, great head, awesome taste, after taste even better and ABV a nice bonus. No I am not going to get into flavors and what not. This beer is delicious to my taste buds. So for me I could drink this everyday. Try it. Just my advice from a guy who likes beer from mass produced to the high end. Sorry I do not do the fancy reviews. Pour it, drink it rate it!"

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with medium to medium-low carbonation intensity, leading to a lightly effervescent and foamy mouthfeel that is countered by the intense spiciness from the hops and low burn from the ethanol. Ethanol is fairly easily felt on the tongue, throat, and in the nostrils at most stages of sipping. Closes quite dry, with moderate stickiness remaining on the palate."

""

""
""
""
"O: After stage diving into this mosh pit of hops, my palate will need several days of rehabilitation. A solid DIPA that doesn't quite separate itself from other West Coast DIPA's. The strength here in the end lacks interest and complexity."
"O - I love it! This is extremely hoppy and there are not nessisarily enough sweet malts to balance it out. That being said this is supposed to be a hop monster that isn't necessarily balanced, however it is very balanced considering what it is. I will have to try and get a few more of these for those nights when I want my pallet blown away."
""
"Can't find much fault with appearance, it's amber with an incredibly persistent frothy foam that's sticky and leaves clots and sheets of lace. There's still an a foamy head 10 minutes later..Smells of grapefruit, pine resin, pineapples. Taste is nicely bitter across the tongue with a washing of citrus pith, resinous hops and hints of pineapple flavors and a light bit of malt. The body is just outstanding. Thick and creamy with lots of heft. You can tell this is a big beer. The velvety mouthfeel, It really ties the beer together. Very impressive mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers on the palate for a long time after each sip yet it's not drying to the palate nor overwhelmingly bitter, talk about the nailing the balance for an IPA, this is about spot on."

"The body was a bit more full than is generally seen in the style, and had a bit of bitter finish. Drinkability was hurt by the harsh alcohol taste (although, I did end up drinking 3 in a row, so there's that). Overall, a decent enough brew, one worth trying if you see it, but don't get anxious if you miss it."

"LOVED this beer. Picked up a couple bottles of it at the bottle shop and drank this one fresh, reviewing from tasting notes. Clear, orange-amber body with a nice off-white head and lots of lacing. The smell is jam-packed with juicy hops, malty sweetness, and a little alcohol. The taste follows suit, with the hops taking center stage with floral, piney, but mostly citrus and juicy flavor notes. A lot of malt but it is well balanced by the hoppy bitterness. the alcohol is certainly there but isn't unwelcome. The mouthfeel is nice, crisp, dry, and medium-full. I really love this beer and glad I got to have it."
"Overall: Simply a massive IPA. Excellent to drink if you enjoy putting your tongue through the rigors. Great stuff, and the fresher you can get it, the better. Should be available if you can get Stone beers in your area, and at $7.99 per bomber (locally), it's worth giving the mouth some exercise. Would highly recommend."

"This stuff has renewed my belief in IPAs. It as delicious! What a relief to finally be able to love a beer again. The aroma was good, and the taste was even better. Gorgeous head, guess lacy describes it, still there after writing about it. Was yum with hotdog for lunch; interesting with my Thai coconut shrimp soup (probably not the best choice with it, but its all I have to eat). Better than Ruination perhaps"
""
""
"Glad they brought this one back."
"This is a wonderful beer. This really is an amped up version of ruination. Strong bitterness and aromatic hops. High ABV, but well hidden.This dude will sneak up on you. 3 ten once pours dropped me on my butt. I am not one of those that dismisses stone. Any brewer that puts out enjoy by, irs, ruination, sublimely self-righteous and distributes all those other beers for others is aces by me. This is their best beer. Not for the faint of heart, but when has stone ever been. If you like IPA's run and get this one."
"Hands down the best IPA I have tasted. Surpasses Heady Topper in taste. The hops come through strong but not to the point where it turns bitter. The smell combines beautifully with the taste. Very well balanced character with a slight sweetness. Excellent work, once again Stone."

"Beautiful red hue and thin, lightly foamy head. Smells like the catbox. Scoopable clay litter. That's not a condemnation, it's just a fact. Stanky, sticky icky icky. Tastes like a hoppy punch in the eye, and that's a GOOD thing. Nice bitterness, and full bodied hop flavor. A robust beer that is a great way to finish an evening, because at 10.80 ABV, you won't be able to hang too long. Drink the swill, then treat your palate to the full frontal skank of Ruin Ten!"
"This is a very solid IPA. Well balanced, very drinkable and i want more. After taste is not overwhelming as I often notice in imperial IPA's. What more can I say: After trying this I quickly went out and purchased 3 more bottles. Price was great also."

"The beer pours a pale orange with a minimal head of tiny white bubbles. The beer’s body is clean with light carbonation bubbles trundling up throughout the glass. On the nose, the beer smells a little strange. Catty notes with nice, pine punches from the original Ruination recipe, are what come through from the hops while the malt is quite big and sticky on the nose with stale caramel and bread notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely bitter and very sweet with a light tart bite from the acid in the beer, the mouth sends a lot of spittle to keep the mouth neutral. In flavor, the beer begins with a sticky sweet, catty flavor that is not my favorite, but as the beer opens, ruinous pine notes clobber aside the catty notes. Alongside the raping pine is a sweet caramelly bread, which sits lighter on the tongue than the ruinous pine. The finish is of prickly pine with a touch of citric bite, while the finish is of sweet, mellowing caramel malt. In the mouth, the beer feels slightly slick and syrupy in the mouth, sitting on the light side of heavy in the mouth. Carbonation is light and smooth with a slight tingle of bubbles and then a bite from the bitters. The mouth is left sticky with saliva and hop resin. Overall, I wasn’t too impressed for my first few sips, but as I went the beer got better to drink. There is a little bite of alcoholic heat, but overall it covers up its 10+% ABV very well and is quite nice to sip. I like this beer, though it’s not what I would initially reach for when going for a DIPA, but it is nice to sip and it definitely gets you with its ABV. A beer worthy of a try."
""
""
"Another hopped up, bitter IPA from Stone. The 10.8% abv is well hidden."
""
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops is very powerful with some sweet malt notes. Taste is also dominated by powerful notes of citrus and piney hops with limited bitterness level with a solid malt backbone that is more caramelized and sweet then I was expected. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid hops punch but would have preferred this beer with less sweetness and less caramelized malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I loved this one but it is definitely not for the faint of heart. This is an extremely bitter DIPA but definitely worth trying if you're into tons of hops. Haven't had Ruination in a while, but I think this is, while different, just a bit better. Great beer from Stone."
""
""
"Overall this is a great really good double, big hop aromas and plenty of bitterness."
"This is probably, in the eyes of Stone, the equivalent of hop pornography. It's also a test in endurance, and was amazingly flavorful and pushes dry hopping to the next level, but it also is way too over the top, even by Stone's standards. Too syrupy at the finish as well, which is a shame, as the initial thickness and creaminess was pretty heavenly. Not very high in terms of being drinkable, but every hophead should try this at least once. Just make sure you go into it knowing what you're getting yourself into."
"O: Fantastic IPA. Cannot go wrong. Highly highly recommend.. sweet, smooth, very very drinkable. One of best IPA's on my books... go out and get this.. (costco, at least on the west coast, has this for about $5 which is a steal for the bomber!!). Great job Stone!!!"

"I'd buy it again."
""
"Overall-double IPA's of this quality is why I drink craft beer. This thing is a monster of a brew, it is hoppy yet completely balanced with malt to make it an extremely enjoyable experience. Stone is slowly becoming one of my favorite craft brewers, they make incredible beer and its usually easy to find and get. This is the best DIPA I've had in sometime. 4.75"

"O: This is good stuff. Now if only they'd bring back their 10th Anniversary Ale. . . ."

"o. I would not buy this again, bunch better beers for the price."

"It took a while to get going, but it's pretty good, particularly if you like hop bombs. Much better than Ruination IPA. The alcohol shows up sparingly with some ho hum heat, but this beer is moderately smooth and could get you in trouble with the ABV if you're not paying attention (and your palate can handle it)."
"Pours a nice deep amber color with a minimal head. Smell is all hops, you know what you're in for. There's a sweetness in the back with the hoppiness in the front, but balance is totally missing. For me, it was a bit of a chore to drink - I'm glad I tried it but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again."
""
""
""
"Clear honey colored with fine streams of bubbles rising up to. Tightly bubbled head of beige from that settles out quickly. Amazing aroma of bright citrusy hops , lots of tangerine and grapefruit rind. Big flavors of hoppy goodness, orange rind pith, tangerine, ruby grapefruit, plus some piney notes. Alcohol strength definitely makes itself known, which detracts from the experience IMO. Finishes dry and very bitter, with notes of grand marnier liqueur booziiness. Good beer, but trying to be so extreme pushes the edges of the envelope into unnecessary places."
""
""
""
""
"O-a very good double, great presentation, taste, and finish. Hoppy and smooth. Very good."
"Would almost work as a night cap for me. Since it's an annual thing now, I'll probably always get at least one bottle, but not much more than that."
"D - At near 11%, deceptively drinkable."
"Drinkability- This was very good. I loved it! Definitely one to buy again and again!"
"Overall Stone makes some serious IPA's and this is no exception. I've always been a Ruination fan and this feel fresher and lighter. A must try for any bold IPA fan. I will be getting next years batch."
""
"Very good DIPA. Not overly crushing on the palate but still quite bitter. Nice flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high hopes for this one, but overall my biggest complaint is that the alcohol smell and taste is too prevalent for me. Bummed! Good, but not great."
""
""
"Overall, it's a great meal replacement. If RuinTen truly is a single-time offering from Stone - I'll be sad when it's gone. While it's not a ground-breaking IPA, it's a intriguing alternative to my usual rotation."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer, more than the original is really depending on my mood. It's extremely tasty it lacks some other aspects but overall a very good beer. There are some comparisons and definitely an incredible substitute to Enjoy By. When you have one you will understand. Salud!"
"Overall - Very good IPA, everything combined makes for a great beer. Like other reviews state, I can't get paste one of these without feeling full; however, the overall characteristics of the beer definitely allow you to enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really dig this beer and honestly, is exactly what I like about a high abv DIPA. Bravo."
"Overall-Good beer with the aroma being my favorite part. Like a lot of the Stone's there isn't any way to drink more than one before getting completely full."
""
""
"Overall: Really fuckin nice. Taking a quick sip of this is like taking a shot of whiskey. It leaves a nice warming sensation in your stomach which is reminiscent of whiskey or a deep red wine. When you thoroughly investigate the brew further however you begin to see the beautiful hue, oddly sweet bitterness and unusually thick mouthfeel for an IPA. The high ABV in this beer shines through proudly and I have absolutely no problem with it!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.25: Outstanding indeed. Wonderful beer and there is absolutely no hint of the high ABV. This brew is imminently sessionable but brings so many unique and elitist flavor profiles to your humble glass. Highly recommended, but it ain't cheap ($8 for a 22 oz bottle)."
""
""
""
""
"pours dark orange with a two finger off white head. smell is sweet bread, lemon, citrus, slightly boozy. the taste is the hop bomb that you would expect. very imperial taste, deep mellow warm hops, lots of lemon, citrus, pine, biscuit, I even get some cherry and stone fruit. slightly thicker than a typical IPA, as expected. This beer is very intense as expected but what I was so impressed with was the finish. most imperial IPAs are on the maltier side and they typically have a bitter fist to the tongue for an after taste. this had an extremely smooth finish for the amount of hop presence. This isnt my style but i really liked it and Im glad i got to drink it on the second time around"
""
""
""
"Overall a phenomenal IPA but I'd give a slight nod to the enjoy by ipa from stone... very slight... still liked it better then the reunition one.. a definite must try"

""
""

""

"O - one of the best imperial IPA's I've ever had. Although I think Stone's Enjoy By is slightly better."
""
""
""
"A very overrated beer IMO. I was expecting a hop bomb and received a malt bomb with a lot of hops added. I don't know how else to put it, but it tastes like an old DIPA. Very disappointing. Not much else to say. I would not waste my money again. Ruination and the regular IPA are much better."
""
""
"If this lands in your neighborhood grab a couple of bottles and stash one for a couple of months."
"O - Its ruination, but overly hopped and too strong. Not thats great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Add on : the review was for the original release, the 2014 batch has a great cayenne/white pepper finish that really wows the tastebuds!"
""
""
"Needless to say, if you are a hop head… why are you still reading this, no seriously… go buy this. You won’t regret it."
""
""
""
""
""
"As it warms the malt becomes heavy and little sweet for my taste and the bitter is a bit loud. The fruits were forthright but they lost to the oily pine. Hints of nutty qualities as it warmed. They made a very big beer. A hop bomb, a huge fat hoppy beer. It's pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"Had I reviewed the first half of this beer only, I would have loved it. The latter half proved to be a bit too sweet, borderline-cloying, and overpowered with malt. The hop profile was beautiful, but unfortunately it doesn't shine strong for more than 15 minutes or so. I prefer the regular Ruination to this, if only for the lighter malt bill, however this brew is still pretty solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent DIPA. Extremely flavorful and well balanced. Glad stone decided to make this a yearly release."
"Remarkable beer. Keep on doing your thing Stone!"
"O: A good DIPA, not the best and far from the worst but a very good brew non the less.."
""
""
"Pours out a brassy amber with a thinnish, frothy head. Smells like whenever I make hop tea. Hops have an earthy and herbal character. Tastes like sweet hop tea. Again, the hops lean more towards earthy and floral tones. Pretty sweet overall with not THAT much bitterness in the end. This is more about the flavor of the hops over crushing bitterness, although there is a bitterness that lingers on and on. Mouthfeel is a tad thick and sticky, but not exaggeratedly so. Nice bit of prickly carbonation. I'm not big into DIPAs (too sweet for me), but, just as with Enjoy By, Stone managed to win me over."
""
"Had this on tap from the brewery and was blown away. It pours a darker amber color but with the glass at your waste, you can smell the awesome coming from this beer. Grapefruit was the first to hit my nose, then the pine and clove like hints following. I have been lucky enough to find plenty Pliny the Elder offerings but this one has it beat in my opinion. I bought a bottle just to do a sanity check and further verified my initial opinion. This beer is outstanding. The only somewhat downfall is that it is pretty heavy in the mouthfeel department. Stone has outdone themselves with this one. I'll take this over the Enjoy By any day. Not to say Enjoy By is slacking but the Ruin Ten is a step above anything I've had from them."
"This is a damn good Double IPA but I certainly have some thoughts. At just about 11%ABV the malts come out and remind me slightly of Hog Heaven and other American Barleywines, I know this border is blurry at times. It also makes me wonder how the hell Russian River makes Pliny the Younger. When I had it a few years ago I knew it had an absurdly clean hop flavor for 12% but I still haven't found a beer that is above 10% with that same feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, brings some nice hops that almost seem overbearing but somehow don't. I haven't had a super bitter DIPA in a while, so it's nice to have one again since most IPAs have moved onto tropical fruit no balance IPAs. This seemed to have a nice balance since there was so much of everything. However, not quite the summer beer I was hoping, and still nothing spectacular."
"I have to score points for audacity and strength but it just isn't my favorite tastes in an IPA."

"Stone has done it again for 2013 with the latest incarnation of their Ruination Anniversary IPA! Enjoying another one with my BA bro, y2korey. Wow, the aroma is intense, color is glorious, hops are bitter and beautiful, and flows throughout with amazement! I had a few of these when Stone first released the 10th Anniversary last year and I'm happy they've decided to rerelease it again. Nice addition to your portfolio, Stone!"
"O: One of the best examples of the double IPA example you can get your hands on, and at a bargain basement price. I don't know how they do it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is exactly what I would expect as a Double IPA from Stone. That said, I get it, it's hoppy, but at some point there must be some restraint; or perhaps I'm just getting tired of the West coast hop-bomb. Too much of a good thing, as they say, but sure to please those with less sensitive taste buds."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this beer were 150%-200% what it retails for, I'd say it's solid, but only worth the investment if you're really really looking for it. Considering the price point, it is an absolute monster. This is one thing that Stone has consistently been very very good about. Controlling for the inflation inherent in bombers, they manage to make consistently good to great beers at relatively reasonable prices. If you like any of the descriptors I used in this review, go get this beer today. If you're not as big on hoppy citrus bombs, it's still worth trying unless you really really don't like the bitter side of brewing (because this is definitely the bitter side of things)."
""
""
"O- I liked this a whole lot more last week when I had it, but I didn't have the time to review it. It seems like the hops are dropping off very fast, or maybe my palate is just off tonight. This is still an incredibly well made beer, and based on my previous experience I am ranking it a bit higher overall than I would based solely on this review."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good DIPA, but I was expecting much more. I feel underwhelmed. I just can't put it in that top-tier category for the style. Nonetheless, it's really solid stuff."
"O-A good imperial IPA that is hyped up due to its limited availability. Ruination gives it a run for its money for being a better put together Imperial IPA. This beer is good dont get me wrong but I believe it is hyped up. Its worth seeking out so get one anyways and try it out for yourself."
"d: good not great. Too much going on on the hop side of things, not enough balance or focus. take a step back and tweak stone."

"Overall: This beer lives up to its expectation. This is my favorite Double IPA. I need to buy a case of this and a shirt! I wish this was offered regularly all year long enough said."
"overall: Wow this beer got a lot of hype. Glad I picked up two of them, a very great beer for what it is, an extreme, huge hop bomb. Stone went all out on this, and it's pretty hard to rate this to style, it's sort of it's own unique thing. I think i may prefer Ruination to this, and by prefer I mean I could drink it more easily on a regular basis. This is something every hop head should seek out and try, but far from Stone's best beer. Glad I tried it, but I thought it could have been a little better. I would have liked more tropical, fruity, floral notes instead of straight pine and it seemed a little too sweet for my liking. However, it does do it's job, completely destroys your palate. I will drink my other one in a few days and possibly re edit my review."
""
""
"O: Delicious! Absolutely delicious! This is by far my favorite IPA (sorry Sixpoint Resin). This is a perfect example of the style: ridiculously full of hop character (you can taste every bit of the 5 lbs), strong alcoholic profile. There is only one thing I find wrong with this beer: I can't drink anything else after it; my taste buds are bombed. Too bad, I was going to rate another beer. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!"
""
""
"This one was underwhelming to me. There isn't enough kick in the smell and this is on the sweeter side of DIPAs"
""
""
""
"O: A really BIG beer from Stone. A little too big for my tastes, but a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seriously this beer looks amazing! Golden orange-yellow color with a thin white head that smells of sweet malt, a touch of caramel, good sweet citrus and a great hop-forward presence. Taste is just a bit much for me; Ruination decided to RAGE! I love the increased malt character, but the additional hops is just too dominant. I do like how the hops dance on my tongue, and the slight bite from the hops. The linger of the hops in the middle of my tongue is quite nice. FT my other RuinTen..."
""
"O- Overall I think this offering from Stone deserves high marks. As the bottle says, it is """a stage dive into a mosh pit of hops""". I could never drink two of these in a session, in fact it may be hard to finish all 22 ounces of this beast. Highly recommend to my hop-loving pals, but American lager drinkers would hate this one!"
"O - I enjoyed this much more than I expected. Especially after the salesman at the liquor store gave me his opinion. Definitely worth the money, especially if you're looking to feel the alcohol"

"Overall, a strong-like-bull Imperial, but the highly acidic characteristics are a bit much here. Stone Enjoy By is a much more palatable IPA for those searching for tropical qualities, and a less acidic hop wallop."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one hop attack of an IPA and really enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Stone RuinTen IPA ---4/5."
""
"O - I missed out on the original 10th Anniversary, so I have been looking forward to this one since I heard it was returning. Stone is not bashful with the hops in their IPAs, and this is probably the hoppiest of the bunch. Pine and citrus exchange blows, but I think pine is the primary flavor I get. Sweet malts are not prominent, but they do make themselves known. This is a very good IPA, but I don't think it lived up to my expectations. If given the choice, I would take Enjoy By over this. This is probably one of the hoppiest beers I have ever tasted. I will probably seek this one out every year, but can't put it among my favorite few IPAs as I had hoped."
"I wasn't exactly blown away by this beer given it's hype, but it was still a good drink. I could name many other DIPAs I'd rather be drinking, including """enjoy by""" and the original ruination. The balance was a little off on this one, the hops kind of just punched you in the face instead of working together. Do try it though."
"A good DIPA just not up to the standards that Stone usually delivers. Simply put, it lacks balance."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice amber color with a two-finger head (with an aggressive pour) with only slight lacing as you drink it down. Immediate hop aroma and flavor. Very citrusy, piny, with a very nice balanced malt backbone. Very hop-centric though. The hop bitterness lasts as you swallow, but it isn't at all too much. Enjoyable beer."
"O: Let me just say that Stone got me into beer with Ruination (especially IPAs) and I just missed this since I really got into beer in December 2012, but whole hog not until late February 2013, so I was disappointed that I missed this. I am glad I got to try it, but it seems that I prefer both Ruination and Enjoy By over this. I'm surprised out how good Stone is at brewing so many distinct IPAs. It really tastes like a combination of Enjoy By and Ruination."

""

"Overall: Is it another massive hop bomb? Yes, but it is done with the mastery that Stone continues to show in their IPAs. Scary drinkable, scary amount of hops, just the way I like to be scared. Got get yourself a bottle."
""
""
"Poured dark golden, slightly hazy with a good three finger thick head after a pretty aggressive pour. The foam subsided slowly and left a good thick quarter-inch layer that provided a beautiful lace to the end. The aroma was flower, citrusy, and pretty sweet, with some fresh-baked bread notes. Mild tropical fruit, pineapple and resiny pine also came forward.  The taste is just like the aroma, with big citrus and tropical fruits, pine and some sweet bready malt. What an excellently balanced brew! Overall, RuinTen is one of my favorite Stone brews. Although this beer is already a couple of months old, the hops seemed to hold up really well. Can't wait until next year's version is released."
""
""
"An exercise in futility for the non-hophead. A hop lover's delight. This beer ranks somewhere north of 'Insane'. Besides all that mumbo-jumbo, it's simply a really great beer. Totally satisfying. Leaves absolutely nothing to be desired for the style. It's just mega. You can either handle 'mega' or you can't. Either way, this beer would sit on the shelf another hour or so before being snagged by someone who loves 'mega'."
""
"O- Even with the high expectations, this is one awesome DIPA. Dangerously drinkable as well. Pretty much everything you could want from the style"
""
""
"O - Stone knocked it out of the park! This is a completely different monster than the """Enjoy By""". Don't expect a ton of fruit. But if you are looking for a malt-driven, pine-like, hoppy DIPA, look no further....RuinTen is here!"
"Overall - I definitely enjoy regular Ruination over this. Rough alcohol and not enough of a hop profile to justify it."
"O: A good beer, but give me Enjoy By anyday. This beer just needs some of the alcoholic tendencies honed down and this good beer could be a great beer. Nothing bad about it and interesting no doubt."
"O - Very nice beer. If your into Imperial IPA's please grab a few of these you won't be disappointed. Highly Recommended! Cheers!!"
""
""
""
"This one is for people who need their palates to be annihilated. It's one of the strongest, booziest, hoppiest IPAs I've ever had."
"o) good, flavorful, and surprisingly easy to drink for being strong. i want to enjoy every sip."
""
""
"O: Huge tropical hops and toasty malts. What's not to love. This is by far one of the best impy's I've had. Succulent and smooth. Great way to celebrate a anniversary. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: Now this is a hop bomb if I've ever seen/drank one. The malts provide barely enough backing, but the point of the beer was to be a hop monster, which it is. Impressively drinkable for nearly 11% and being so damn hoppy. Decent price-point at under $8 for a bomber. I'm glad this will be an annual release now. This will definitely cure any insatiable thirst for hops"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This takes ruinination and thrashes it up!! Bitter, bitter pine and earth. This is completely unbalanced. The tropical fruit keeps your mouth salivating for more and the hops definitely deliver! And i cant say enough about the finish. It seems to come in waves. Awesome beer!! /96"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This joins the elite cadre of beers that is greater than the sum of its parts. This category may well be titled """experience", as this bomber is in fact an experience. The alcohol doesn't reveal itself significantly in the flavor, but I could feel it after only a few swallows. This, along with it's (slightly) tamer brother are drinking experiences that few other beers have been able to imitate."
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy apricot color supporting a firm, just-off-white head, about an inch thick in the tulip glass. Foam is pocked with craters. Grapefruit and tangerine rind aromas predominate. Pine resin. Stinging bitterness right away, accompanied by apricot, mango, and tangerine flavors, finishing with a grapefruit zest bitterness. Some understated caramel sweetness appears as the beer warms. This is a big IPA. Although it is primarily medium-bodied with an oily, resinous character at first, the beer does begin to feel heavy. A nice annual release overall."
""
""
""

"O: Worth a buy if you are a hop head as this is a blast on the palate. Really an outstanding stand-alone brew but not really a good beer to pair with anything. Another amazing Stone creation"
""
""""Ruination on steroids""" - that pretty much sums up RuinTen. I'd also liken it to Hoptimum, although much better executed in terms of hiding the alcohol. Big malt and big hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""""A stage dive into a mosh pit of hops""" Nice! Pretty much describes it. This beer starts out looking impressive and smells amazing and at first tastes great. Great turns to good as I struggle to finish the 22 oz bomber. Hops truly overpower any trace of a malt backbone. At near 11%abv it is not disguised and hits you in the face at the halfway point both in feel and in taste. Have to knock it down 1/2 a point for tasting the booziness of the beer. Otherwise an outstanding offering any hopheads should experience."
""
"Great brew, glad I got to pick it up on its limited run. Balanced really nicely and shows off the hop character substantially. Definitely feel the alcohol though. This is potent. Personally like the Enjoy By series a bit better from what I have had for my personal tastes, but this is a wonderful beer overall."
"O: Overall this is delicious. Id be hard pressed to find a DIPA fresh right now in the New England area that is more bitter and refreshing at the same time as this is right now."
""
"Excellent, readily available beer. Does not disappoint."
"Drink by date of 9-5-13. This beer is great, a lot like Ruination but with slightly more fresh hop taste, more maltiness, and more alcohol. It's excellent, but I'm not quite sure what the point is compared to Stone's usual offerings. Although the hops rock, It's slightly too malty sticky for my tastes, and it is sort of absurdly potent. I'd rather have a couple of Ruinations because I like the mouthfeel better and I would not fall out of my chair..than again the fresh hop taste of Ruin Ten is nice and it's good to get one's ass kicked once in awhile, I suppose."
"O - Fantastic. A big, bold but superbly balanced DIPA. I'm gonna say it: just as good as Heady Topper."

"I had this beer on tap and in a bottle. Busy weekend! The appearance is a beautiful copper color. The smell is crisp """C"" hops with a hint of malty goodness. The taste follows suit with grapefruit from the hops and carmel and light brown sugar from the malt. The mouthfeel is pleasant with a slight glycerin slipperiness. Overall I am super excited about this beer. It is big, 10.8% abv, so I did take my time sipping it slow."
""

"was pretty excited to try this- i was in the mood for an ipa, and this one is like needing a gun and someone handing you a missile launcher. the color is a nice crisp golden. there is white head and a ton of thick lacing. the smell is supper hoppy with citrus. the flavor is a whole mouth experience. the bitter hops coats all of your mouth with heavy pine and bitter. this is a beer to buy an enemy that drinks bud, so you can see the look on his face when this beer does kung-fu in his mouth."

"22 ounce bottle, drink by 09/05/13 stamped on it. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours an orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is very nice, it smells mostly like pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some earthy notes and bit of bready malt noticeable too. Of course the lingering finish is good and bitter! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and a little creamy with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, I'm glad I picked this up earlier today. Definitely worth trying, and I'll be buying this again in the future. $7.99 a bomber."

"Reddish orange in color with a light tan colored head that laces nicely as you drink. Piney hops in your face, lots of hops, boozy aroma as well with some floral aroma in the background. The first sip tastes really syrupy, like someone took a handful of hop cones and squeezed them into my mouth. Really sweet with bitterness after, but not as bitter as I thought it would be. The alcohol is pretty well hidden as well. This is a real heavy hitter, probably the most intense IPA i've had which is not necessary a bad thing - you gotta be in the right mindset to enjoy it."
""
"O - This is a really massive and palate destroying DIPA. Lots of flavors here with a manageable but large level of bitterness. This is a damn good beer and I'm happy this is now an annual release. However, Enjoy By is just so much more up my alley and is a rotating release."
""
""
""
"o: Halfway through I just notice on the label it is 10.8%. Indeed it is. Boozy one this. Love the hoppy bitterness just wish they toned down the booziness just a tad. A must try for hopheads, no question. A true palate wrecker as well. I think I might need to take a nap now..."

"overall it delivers whats promised. personal preference, i like more balanced IPAs such as pliny, but if youre in the mood to get destroyed by hops, then this one might overtake palate wrecker as king."
"I tried this beer before ever trying Stones ruination IPA. My father in-law said it was a little different from the regual and became furious when I told him I had never tried the regular. He cracked this guy open and drank from a snifter. Relly pretty dark gold color with a hope varient that isn't common to stone. OK mouth feel with extreme hop notes... Not sure what hop in particular but they put a bunch of this one strand. Overall good beer... not the best."
"A - It is translucent golden orange in color with a quickly fading small, off white head with minimal lacing."
"O - It's a big, bad west coast DIPA... I'd would have liked to compare it to FFF dreadnaught Ina side-by-side.  I'm glad I got to try it, especially in the summer hear, but once was enough for me.  I'd recommend it to hopheads, but it's not a beginner craft beer."

"4/4.5/4/3.75/4.25"
"O - Ruination is a really enjoyable beer and comparing this side by side there's no way I'd peg these as being siblings. Definitely worth trying but do it now as opposed to later before all the hops fade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a quality (¿triple?) IPA. Lots of hops, but still very drinkable. I'm impressed with the tasty, piney flavor as well as the nice, slightly softer aroma. I would tend to look for a bit more balance in an IPA like this, but this is certainly close."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an amazing beer. So incredibly flavorful with over-the-top hop intensity - it's the culmination of American hop-assult beers."

"Well Stone, you have done it again. I thought you peaked with Enjoy By but I guess I was wrong. This beer is absolutely amazing. It's a Kung Fu kick to the palate. So much hop goodness and all balanced out by enough sweet malt to keep you coming back for more. If you are a fan of aggressively hoped DIPA's or just want to drink one of the best beers in the world, do yourself a favor and seek this out. You will not regret it. The best part is you will be drunk off of one bottle!"

"O: Nice big hopbomb."
""
""

"Overall (4.25): As noted in the smell, taste, and feel, this is a big, bold DIPA, with a surprising amount of balance. It’s not the hoppiest or the most memorable DIPA I’ve had, but all of the most prominent components—hops, malt, and booze—blend in to each other well, which is the mark (to me, anyway) of a well-crafted DIPA. For me, I think I actually prefer the regular Ruination, because it’s a lean, mean, hop-blasting machine, while this is a big, thick DIPA with its own character. But this is plenty good in its own right, too, and worth seeking out if you like DIPAs brash, thick, and balanced."
""

"O: Great beer. First beer from Stone I've had, and it makes me excited to try some of the other varieties I picked up."
""
""

""
""
"Overall, superb. I was impressed with Enjoy By, and this is just as good, if not better. Well done Stone."
"Mouthfeel is thick, slightly filmy, a little sticky. Oveall, this is an excellent beer."
"O: Fantastic, couldn't have asked for anything more. One of my new favorites."
""
""
""

"Overall: One of the best high ABV DIPAs I've had. Worth a try. Would definitely get again. [4.5]"

"Pours to a very hazy orange copper gold body. Head is a full two inches of biscuity off white creamy fuzz. Nose is fruity up front then dominated by resiny full with hints of pine and woodsy grasses. This beer hits the mouth with a tangy champagne bitterness that is wonderfully dry and very crisp. Prickly on the tongue with a long lingering bitterness on the mouthfeel. This brew really defines a great DIPA on the dryer side. This is one I would love to have more of to pair with food. Hopefully they bring this one back as a permanent brew."

"Overall: a great beer. I'm surprised it aged this well in less than 8 months...I'd expect these characteristics from a year+ old Hog Heaven or Hopsickle...reminds me of the two year old 120 I had last year.(less boozy of course)"

"excited to score a bottle of this one. It goes very heavy of the hops, of course, Citra and Centennial dominate the nose along with citrus and very, very light pine. The taste was fairly frustrating as the nose gets overpowered by the 10.8 ABV. Definately better than standard ruination, but fails to have that wow factor that we search for in the ultimate beer. enjoyable for a hop-head but this will faintly be remembered for nothing more than an over-the-top anniversary release."

"Reviewed from notes. Bottle from Rick’s in Alexandria. Served in a Stone goblet. Pours a moderate golden color with a nice white head. The nose is an overload of citrus hops and a bit of pine. From there, it goes downhill. The flavor is indeed quite hoppy and fairly nice, but it’s also fairly boozy, which is an unpleasant sensation when combined with the extreme bitterness. Definite heat there. Not very drinkable."
""

""
""
""

"The beer poured a golden color with a fingers worth of a white head that left great lacing. The aroma was of citrus and pine. The flavor profile was dominated by citrus and pineapple with numerous tropical fruits in the background. The mouth feel was sticky and finished dry and bitter."

"A powerful and flavorful brew. A little over-the-top with the boozy ABV character, but lots of interesting tasting notes within its depths."
"Bottle. Slightly hazy gold pour with smallish white head. Aroma is hoppy, menthol, some stinky onion, not particularly enticing. Taste is oniony, wet, really bitter. Not much tropical fruits and pine, lots of bitterness and alcohol. Really not what I was expecting. A bitter disappointment to say the least."
""
""
""
"Tied with DDH Ruination as the best ipa Stone has produced by far. A true CA masterpiece. Giant citrus, tropical fruit and oily pine notes balanced in a big way with a moderate boozyness and a solid malt backbone. This should be made again and again. I was beginning to despise Stone til they redeemed themselves with this bad boy."

"This is an impressive IPA. It was inspired from another great IPA. I really liked this creation from Stone."

"Top 5 of all time!! Stone is badass as usual!"

"O: I am glad to have the full bomber. I will buy again. Stone IPAs - I love 'em! Worth every penny. Note, when I did have a second one 3 weeks later, the hops had degraded a bit and it was hotter and not as enjoyable. Pliny effect."
""

"O - I love hoppy beers, and normally I find the Double/Imperial IPA to come through too malty for my tastes. This one overcame that obstacle and still had plenty of citrus come through, and enjoyed it quite a bit."

""
""
"O- delicious wish this was the regular ruination would love to see this one in 4-paks"
""
""
""

""
""
"This beer doesn't dissapoint, even though its not the freshest of the fresh at this point. Massive hops, balanced with just enough malts. Hopheads need to try this."
""
""
""
"[O] Well, as expected, Stone 10th is extremely underwhelming at this point - obviously a shell of it's former self. I expected some major drop off going in to this experience so I'm not mad. I'm sure it was a lovely brew in it's hay."
""
"O - Overall a very good double IPA, although not the hop bomb that might have been expected out of Stone for this special release. Malty is a bit of an understatement...and balanced, this is not. Really complex combination of flavors and sensations. A worthy beer for sure, although I think I like the standard Ruination a little better."
""
""
"9/9/14-This year's batch tasted like fresh squeezed hop juice filtered through citrus peels and dropped into a DIPA. More exotic fruits like mango, pineapple and passion fruit mix with the strong citrus flavors and rich malty backbone that is like a liquid graham cracker stirred into a hop bomb. 10.8% ABV is completely hidden as this is once again very smooth and easy to drink. Stone keeps making this brew better, so I can't wait until the next batch."

"22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Pours a dull burnt orange hue with a 2.5 inch cream-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly collapses in on itself. Head eventually settles into a broken, frothy cap with some residual textured clumps of lacing present as the liquid recedes. Clarity is on the murky side. This beer is a malt bomb - I can smell it from two feet away. That said, nose also expresses a slight oniony character, earthiness, citrus and rind (in that order). Big malt presence in the flavor profile. There's a caramel/toffee presence off the bat which is quickly cut by ethanol and earthy/rindy citrus flavors. The onion quality present in the nose comes out again towards the back, but it is much less assertive in the flavor profile. Finish is a combination of sweet and bitter; a nice juxtaposition. Great mouthfeel - medium-bodied with a lively, although not overly assertive, carbonation. There's a slightly oily texture and a light acidity that stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. Overall, I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try this. All of the elements don't necessarily come together for me, but this is a pretty good DIPA. I'd like to see what 2-3 years does to this beer. I definitely think it will take on some barleywine-esque qualities as it matures."
""
"(O)- A massive DIPA in every sense of the hops totally overtaking every corner that this beer has to offer; and I like it!"
""
""
""
""
"O: really good, very balanced. But yet happy it's my last one. I've almost confused myself with that feeling. Maybe because I'm finishing with a Zombie. For a quite malty IPA, I like it. Normally, I run from malty IPA, thumbs up here!"
"Hops begin to emanate from pores. Skin takes on green tinge. Hop cones appear behind pupils."
""
""
""
""
"A bright clear copper color with a proper white head and plenty of lacing. The aroma is a heavenly combination of citrus and pear and deep nutty malt. Scrumshish! The flavor brings intense peppery citrus-pine hop mixed with a buttery brandy hint that announces some alcohol but keeps it tasty as all get out. This stuff is leafy and near full bodied with a fairly viscous feel and frothy carbonation. A very impressive, high quality hop brew!"
""
""
"Eric"
""
"Pours cloudy orange-amber with a soapy ivory head. Big, resinous aromas of grapefruit, mango, peach, and pine sap. So stick and """juicy""" smelling. Taste is dominated by more big and bitter flavors of pine resin, grapefruit, tropical fruits, and peaches. Quite boozy, honestly. Mouthfeel is sticky, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Overall a really solid beer, but it can't quite touch the amazing balancing act that is """regular""" Ruination."
"O: A lovely IIPA, I'll be sad if this is the last we see of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was, as promised, ruinous of my palate, but unlike regular Ruination, which I enjoy, this was too unbalanced (on the bitter side) for my liking. Still, if you like powerful hops, this is worth a look."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a blast of dank, sticky hops that provide a lot of earthy bitterness that lingers into a dry finish.  This is countered by a strong tropical and citrus fruit presence that's really juicy and sweet with tons of grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel flavor.  Really well balanced with a complex hop profile followed by a subtle pale malt backbone.  Hints of biscuit and grainy graham cracker before the finish.  Perfectly balanced and the high abv is excellently masked resulting in a deceptively drinkable and delicious beer."
""
""
"Nose is super bitter hops with an obvious malt backbone. Resin, pine, grapefruit, orange and caramel. The taste has a lot of malt up front. Very caramely wrapped up with resinous sticky pine, grapefruit and a hint of orange zest. There is alcohol heat in the stomach but none in the taste. Its definitely """ruination""" for the palate. I think its awesome, but I liked it better on tap and I still think the double dry-hopped Ruination blows this out of the water. These extreme palate wrecking DIPAs always leave me a little disappointed because I hate an IPA with this much malt. I know its supposed to be for balance but I thought the whole purpose of a DIPA was hoppiness. Still an awesome brew from Stone though. I prefer their 16th Anniversary. I can't wait to get a chance to try the Enjoy By IPA to compare it."
"Lingering bits of pine with such a wonderful aroma throughout. I'm glad I got ahold of this. Simply fantastic but what else would one expect?"
""
"This poured out as a nice slightly hazy golden color. The head head it white, it's sticky and leaves a prominent lacing on that glass. The smell of the beer is fresh, lively and floral. Citrousy notes of lemon and lime with some malts in there too. The taste of the beer packs a pretty good punch, the hops are big, lots of citrus and bitterness to the flavor. The mouthfeel has a good amount of body to it. The carbonation was at a good level also. Overall it's a solid beer, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a sampler goblet, this DIPA was a copper color with slightly off-white head. Leaving some lacing in the glass, this beer demonstrated character. The aroma was a malty peppery combination, preparing for a hop explosion. In the initial taste, one gets the carmel of the malts before the hops explode. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and a sweet grassy taste """ruin""" the palate. The citra hops were easily detectable, often overwhelming the less explosive centennial hops. The malt stays in the background, but gives a nice smooth feeling to the ale. The citrus notes continue in the aftertaste while warming the throat as it goes down. This is a DIPA that some non-IPA drinkers even liked. The bitterness that some dislike in IPAs is hidden by the power of the citra."
"O: Very enjoyable but this is a big beer and needs to be sipped slowly. Much too bitter to be easy to drink but I think I like this better than the orignal it was based upon. Really enticing aroma."
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the explosive, borderline abrasive flavoring. Staying true to the Ruination brand, Stone really one-ups themselves here. The flavoring is massive and bitter, while the musky aroma and drying, boozy feel take on not a background role, but rather add additional layers of complexity."
"M: Medium bodied; mouth feel is a bit biscuity, light coating of the mouth and tongue with a light amount of carbonation. Alcohol is a bit noticeable, some warming effect, albeit at 10.8% and drunk by myself, is well hidden. Overall an excellent double IPA, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really good ADIPA that was just a bit too bitter for me to really enjoy after about a 1/3 of the bottle. I love a good balanced ADIPA and am working my way up the bitter mountain as well but this one is an expert climb for sure. Still high recommend especially if you love the bitter. One-time release and was avail here in TX. Rotation - too bitter for me to get another bottle for myself but would try on-tap or sharing."
""
""
"My first Ruination was 10 years ago, mere months after it was released. I didn't know this until Greg Koch told me when I met him for the first time. In my entry for Ruination Ale, I told the story of how it """ruined""" me. It was one of the first double IPAs I had ever had, but definitely not the first. In the intervening 10 years, there has been so much done with palate rippers and booze bombs in the name of hop delivery, it's easy to forget how far we've come, and what a leader this beer really was."
"O: For a DIPA (maybe a triple?), this is nicely balanced with a good bit of malty goodness backing up the fantastic hop bill."
""
"To all the morons giving this a perfect score, get off BA!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a dark-golden color with a thin white head. Smell is nice and citrus-hoppy, a lot like regular Ruination, but isn't overly impressive. Flavor is decent, but disappointing. It's certainly got a bruising hop flavor happening here, but it's quite malty and I'm getting a lot of booze on the back end, especially as it warms up. Mouthfeel is medium-to-full bodied and a little sticky. Overall, I was not super impressed with this beer. Admittedly, I think regular Ruination is a little overrated and I didn't like this as much as the regular one. This seemed to almost border on barleywine territory, and you could really tell that it was nearly 11%. Maybe it's because I spent all last weekend drinking Hill Farmstead beers in Vermont, maybe this beer's a little past its prime, but how this beer is in the Top 100 is beyond me. It's not bad, but it was not super impressive either."
""
"Cheers..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't think I need to reiterate how impressed I was by this beer. I can't remember exactly what this cost, but I know it was less than $10 which is seriously a great deal. Don't let this pass you by."
""
""
""
"Rating for 2012 vintage of Ruinten"
"This beer is welcome in my glass anytime. An enamel ripper of a DIPA."
""
"A great way to celebrate the 10th birthday of Ruination. A massive beer with massive hops the signature of Stone. Well done."
""
""
""
"O: I really wanted to love this. But in the end, it is really just """really good""" and not """excellent""". It's certainly in the Ruination camp of DIPAs in that it makes little to no effort to achieve balance of malt backbone. It is worth the experience but not the greatness example I'd say. Fits into Stone's character and story perfectly though."
""
""
""
""
"Opened it up, poured it in a glass(nice look), put my nose to it and BOOM, this huge blast of citrus just invaded my nostrils and blasted my senses like a shotgun. Had to taste it. Wow soooo strong(10.8 alc vol.) damn that has a lot of flavor. very much a pineapple and grapefruit and some flavor i couldnt get my finger on. definitely not a beer that i felt like shooting down quick, in fact it took me some time to finish because of how darn strong it was but i enjoyed it, left a nice taste in my mouth."
"Orange with an off-white head that sticks around for a bit. Smells of pine and citrus. Enticing. Tastes very much of citrus and pine. Very powerful. Nice bitter hop flavor. Big grapefruit flavor. Medium full mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Great IPA, but a touch boozy.."
""
"O: Overall, a really well done brew that I thoroughly enjoyed.  There are a lot of great DIPAs out there, and I can't consider it amongst the best.  But its certainly a very well done beer that I recommend to any hophead.  Stone consistently produces top notch beers, and for my money their selection of hoppy beers can rival anyones.  "
""
""
""
"If you enjoy the regular ruination then I feel that you will like this one."
"O/D-Stone did the 10th very well. It is truly is hard to say which Ruination I prefer. The original is a bit more exotic in flavor while the Anniversary is somehow even more brash and brazen. Both are incredible. Damn, now I need to go get a bottle of the original Ruination to compare. An absolute success with the 10th."
"O- Very tasty and most definitely a fun take on the original. Drink ASAP, do not age."
""
""
"Overall, very good."
""
""
""
"O: The best one-off DIPA I've had. Hands down. There are seasonal releases that top it, but in terms of a 'celebration' beer, nothing I've tasted comes close. Stone continues its traditon of continually raising the bar. Excellent."
"Overall the bottle went rather quickly and it packed a good buzz. Not sure if I would prefer it to fresh ruination but for the style it was sublime."
""
""

""

"Poors a sloudy and hazed copper tinted amber, small cap of cream colored head, decent retention and lacing, wanted more from a big bad dIPA. Scent is a huge rush of grapefruit juice and pine resin, firm caramel, sugary and lightly toasted malt presence. Big bold and bitter taste leads with citrus rind and juice, strong pine resin, lightly floral. Malts are larger than expected, lots of brown sugar, light caramel and light toast, slight boozyness. Fuller side of medium bodied, dry and lingering bittermess. Overall, the hops are almost over the top and the malt comes through a little too sweet, felt like i was drinking a fresh hoppy American Barleywine over a dIPA."
""
"The beer is orange with an inch of dense, white head. Plenty of sticky lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma is large and in charge. Pine, grapefruit, malt, booze. An in your face beer from Stone. The flavor is a bit hot, with pine, malt, and booze, followed by lighter notes of citrus. Caramel malts lead the way for some subtle grapefruit tartness. Medium to full bodied and sticky on the palate.. Overall, this is really tasty, but not something I would consume in quantity. Indeed, this is a palate ruiner."
""
"Overall this is a nice a very nice DIPA - it suffers somewhat from the malt-over-sweetness required to carry the hops. I prefer regular Ruination - sometimes """supersized""" does not equal better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I dunno, maybe I'm spoiled, living in the land of Abrasive. This is a good DIPA, but nothing about it wowed me. Definitely on the malty side, not surprising at almost 11%. But the hops were not showcased particularly well, IMO."
""
""
"Overall: Very well executed DIPA. I'd buy this as a seasonal for sure."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth and a little sticky. An tasty but over-the-top hop bomb to be sure. Not for the faint of heart. Big time flavor, lacks any subtlety. Aggressive and in your face."
"o - Overall a very good DIPA. I find the normal Ruination a good DIPA, though not my favorite, and I find this one very similar, except a little more orange/citrus and hops in the nose, and more bitterness in the mouthfeel and taste. A good beer; if you like the normal Ruination you'll probably love this one, if you don't then I would pass on it as it is very similar."
""
""
"Served in a Stone IRS Snifter."
""
""
""
"O: A- leading to A of fresher and clean palate."
""
""
"Overall, a great DIPA. I haven't had regular Ruination, but I need to try it to get a solid baseline."
"This is a great tribute to the original destroyer of pallets! Obviously, I like the flavors of this one better than the original, although this may just be due to the effects of a gloriously heavy handed dry-hopping. Very tasty, Stone! You do hops pretty well, and I think most of us hop heads would have to thank you for popularizing the Imperial IPA style!"
"22oz bottle. Pours a super murky dark orange color with a half inch of white head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of citrus, piney, dank hops. Taste is dank, citrusy pine hops. Boozey and hoppy for sure. Really thick and heavy mouthfeel. Certainly tastes like a juiced up Ruination. Glad I got a chance to try it. Tasty hop bomb. Overall, worth seeking out. Great tribute to 10 years of one of the best Imperial IPAs."
""
"Stone Ruination Tenth Anniversary IIPA is a nice looking golden color with some slight bronze tint to it. A nice frothy white foam that builds and leaves some gunk on the glass. Smell is pretty bright and heavenly laden with crisp citrus, orange, grapefuit, other citra brought scents. Some resinous pine with some bubblegum backing. The pale malt is there yet is not detracting. At six weeks in, this is a stellar version of an all ready hopped up DIPA. Bright citrus, orange, papaya, grapefruit. The bubblegum is sweet, the malt brings forth sugars balancing stuff out yet not killing the buzz. Bitter, yes, malt backing, yes, delicious, yes. The body is a step above medium ,resinous, piney and large. Carb is there pricking the tounge. I wish it did not take 6-7 weeks to get over here, but even with a bit of age this is one I would go back to, if I could find another bottle."

"Pours a light, mellow orange with a one finger white head. Nice lacing throughout. Big citrus aroma to start. Freshly cut grapefruit and lesser tropical notes. Some malt and booze as well. Really big flavor here. Really big. Juicy grapefruit, peach and mango to start before a Ruination takeover. Bitter is next. Big pine resin, thick and sticky. Pretty substantial sugary malt does a nice job balancing out the huge hop flavor, before more bitterness on the finish. Solid kick of booze in there is a lone negative IMO. This is my favorite Stone Brew, especially very fresh, where the citra hop shines. Huge DIPA"
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with two finger fluffy off white head. Aroma is of massive pine notes and raw hops. Some caramel malt and booze linger in then nose. I could smell this from the bottle immediately after breaking this one open. Hops dominate the palate from front to back. Piney hops are at the forefront. Incredible hop bitterness coats the mouth and lingers. I will be tasting hops for a week or so. Alcohol is almost undetectable. Is there balance here? No, not really. Is that what Stone was shooting for? No. This is just a hopheads delight and the raw bitterness that Stone managed to get in this bottle is insane. A must try for any IPA lover."
"O - This beer does live up to it's name. It's the most destructive IPA on my pleat that I've ever experienced. Good beer but does not live up to the hype for me."
"M - Medium body and very chewy. Full of resinous hop oils. light carbonation."

"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours dark orange copper with a large white head. Some tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and side of the glass. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving some lacing on the glass. The big hop aromas hit the nose first. I pick up the citrus hop aromas, but the pine aromas are much more intense. There's a big caramel malt aroma as well. There is a gigantic hop flavor explosion in the mouth. The piney resin coats the tongue, bringing a large amount of hop bitterness. The citrus flavors come next as do the sweet malts. For the intensity of the hop flavors, this is extremely well-balanced. The alcohol does not come through in the flavor either. The body is full with moderate carbonation. For such a big style, this is dangerously easy to consume. This is an excellent beer that was well worth the hype."
"Overall: Well worth the hype. I'm glad I was able to get my hands on this beer."

"M: A hop paradise - the bitterness feels like it is still lingering in the back of my month. A bit boozy but that isn't entirely unexpected. One of the hoppiest..."

"D - Wow. This is the hoppiest beer I have ever had. More than Pliny, more than hopslam, just ridiculously over the top. I could smell the hops as soon as the cap came off the bottle and it only got stronger from there. It smell more like hops than a handful of actual hops does. It also comes across as slightly more drinkable than regular Ruination since the extra malt and alcohol helps balance the saturation level of bitterness. Absolutely worth trying and while I know this won't ever become a year round offering I would certainly buy it again if they ever make another batch."

"Overall, this is one of the best double IPAs I've had in a while and definitely worth the wait."
""
""
""
"Get one of these if you can, if your a hophead you will not regret it!"
""
""
"Into a snifter pours a brilliant and very clear orange rust color under a fair and well sustained head. Aroma is undeniably hoppy with a lush bouquet of floral and pine hops that braces the senses for a hop invasion. Sharp bitter concentration of pungently strong pine accented hops delivers the """Ruination""" as promised... Finish leaves a semi salty, grassy pine tattoo on the palate that resonates long after. Nuclear level hop flavor is balanced out fairly well by a solid supporting malt backbone that lets the bitterness burst through."
""
"O: This is definitely in my top five list for Double IPA, just an outstanding beer for a hop head. The balance and smoothness of this beer while having so much hop flavor and a respectable strong bitterness is a real treat."
""
"Overall. Stone nailed it with this brew. Delicious and well crafted. Intense and devastating hops that really put your palette out for a rest but that is so delicious that you can’t help but want more."
"O: Extremely tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, excellent representation of style, this beer is every bit as wonderful as the original. It’s the type of beer that once you start drinking it you won’t want to drink anything else for the rest of the evening."
"Overall, I think this is a great beer. It is a solidly hopped beer with great flavor and aroma combinations. Well worth it if you can get it."
"O: It's no doubt one of the better DIPAs I've had. $10 or so at Beer Heaven in Philly. I grabbed the last one today. If only it had hit Philly earlier than 2 months after it was released. Ridiculous. Extra points for being so awesomely hoppy."
""
"I set this aside for International IPA Day and here we are! It poured with a massive two fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention, leaving sticky lace behind as it fell. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was dense with citrus hops, caramel malt and alcohol heat. I almost needed a seat belt before beginning! Mouthfeel was full, kind of viscous and quite oily on the tongue with lots of citrusy hops on the tongue. Phew! I know that I was missing subtleties in it, but the heat was masking a lot of it for me. Finish was beyond dry, it was f**king arid! Man, I wanted a glass of water just to be able to catch my breath. Phew! This was quite the beer, but a steady diet would be too much, even for this self-avowed hophead."
"This is a heavier than medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A very nice tribute/anniversary brew that I would pick anytime over the normal ruination. After coming down of a week long ruination kick where i was drinking the normal brew just about every day, this anniversary is a real superior treat."

"Like a souped up Sculpin, pretty fucking amazing."
""
"Slightly hazed amber color with a white head. Huge citrus aroma, pine, and tropical fruit. A light floral note, mild malty sweetness, but mostly hops, which is impressive for such a high gravity beer. Really great grapefruit, peach, and tropical fruit. A moderate pine bitterness, and a bit of malt sweetness. Really a great beer."

"If you want a hop bomb, this is a good choice."
"D - An undeniable hop bomb that is a tribute to the artisan nature of craft brewing... Overpowering in a very good way... I wish this weren't an anniversary brew, but rather something to be enjoyed time and time again... I was glad this marked my 1,000th review..."
"A nicely hopped up version of the regular Ruination, with some more alcohol to boot. Drink it fresh! Those lovely hops will fade quickly and you'll lose the fresh herbal notes and resinous qualities of the beer. Right now, you get a blast of citrus and stinky herbs in the nose and then more of the same in the taste with a long bitter finish that is redolent of pine. It's definitely a hop hit, but as big as it is, it's balanced and has a developing flavor profile that runs the range of double IPA flavors. Really well done."
"Hop explosion is a description I'll reuse here as it works! Pours a beautiful deep golden color that is mostly clear - surprising at this strength... but it looks hearty! A moment after removing the cap the intense amount of hops used to brew this beer found my nose a couple feet away within seconds. Needless to say the aroma at closer inspection for fans of hops is nothing short of amazing - fruity, floral, piney. I love hoppy beers but often save them for later in the session. Not so here with this rarity to find on the east coast. I'm enjoying each and every sip. Initially fridge cold this beer tingled the back of my throat and as the beer warms a bit more alcohol is detectable. Awesome beer!!"
""
"O-an interesting variation on their flagship IPA with a distinctly different blend of flavors"
"O - I was expecting this to be good but it ended up being really good. I also had a bottle of this one that wasn't as good as this was so I am glad I got to try it on-tap as well. Nice work Stone!"
"Overall: I feel like a champ for getting halfway through this thing!"
""
"It is beers like this make me want to move to California!"
"Overall – Delicious and dangerous. While at 10.8 % this thick and tasty brew conceals its alcohol quite well. Large sweet and hoppy flavors and a great creamy body make this one to try!!"

"Overall this is a great double IPA, wish I'd bought more."
""
"Overall: I know some folks love this, but I find many of Stone's beers way too sticky to by enjoyable as I like a drier IPA profile; for the style (and accepting the stickiness for what it is) this is a very nice brew"
"O. An outstanding DIPA. Excellent balance and flavor profile. Citra hops shine here and are balanced near perfectly by the malts and more herbal hops. This is a big, juicy DIPA that earns its ranks among the best. I am not sure how the regular Ruination stacks up because I have not had it in so long, but this certainly makes me want to try it again sooner rather than later. An excellent beer. Outstanding."
"O - The bottle should say """drink no other beer after this one, as it will taste like )$)&%)$*&%... """ Amazing amount of hops in your face. They need to bottle this one on a regular basis."
"Final Thoughts: I wish this wasn't a limited release. Definitely in the top ten beers I've had. Get it while you can, it does not disappoint!"
""
"O - right up there with the top beers in this style, too bad it's a one time thing."
""
"O- Mission accomplished. Stone set out to create the ultimate hop bomb and succeeded."

"...I also haven't had a Ruination in awhile. I would have liked to do a side-by side comparison with the two."
""
"This thing packs a Mike Tyson Haymaker, but its doable. Thick and rich, but really good."
""
"Well done and happy 10 years of Ruination! I'm not all that enamored with the standard Ruiniation, this is wonderful. I wouldn't drink it all the time but this is worthy of attention from extreme hopheads anywhere. "
""
"Overall - Really fresh hop citrus flavors captured here. Not nearly as malty as it's namesake counterparts. Does well to hide the 10.8%. My favorite incarnation of Ruination thus far."
"Unbelievably, this beer is balanced and smooth with huge hop flavor but not bittering. Like most of the new Stone beers, it is easily palatable. An amazing achievement considering the beer but it’s so sweet it’s almost a barleywine with just enough linger to remind you it’s Ruination. A good beer and I’m not sure exactly what I was expecting but frankly it’s a little disappointing considering the legacy of Ruination, it’s just a higher ABV version."
"O: I have no idea why I like this so much. I hate IPAs and everything about this is a punch in the fucking face. Well, I guess this is why I don't give up on certain styles even if I'm just not that into them. Occasionally you find one that really reaches out and smacks you."
"O - Overall this was a delicious beer from Stone, a nice improvement on the base. Really like this beer. Definitely a pallet ruiner."
"Overall Stone is really good at what they do and this is no exception. The best comparison to a 10% DIPA is to PtY and Ruination 10th is slightly less clean (both in hop profile, bitterness, and alcohol bite) but it is still an excellent beer."
"Overall: Really, really tasty. Would love to see Stone make it year round or yearly. Would definitely buy again fresh."
""
""
""
"o-great beer. while the sweetness took me by surprise a little i would (and have) bought this beer again. im not sure i would say its an """improvement""" over the original but it deserves its own recognition as a standout beer!"
"Notes: Full-bodied, resinous, and has a slick mouthfeel. Drinkability is superb, as alcohol is hidden very well. Tasty as all Hell, but definitely a palate-wrecker. Definitely worth the investment! A job very well done by Stone!"
""

""
"Cheers!"

"Although there's nothing super-special about its appearance, the 10th ann. IPA has a very nice orange-amber colour that puts it just above average. The smell is pungent - loads of piney hops. It doesn't prepare you for the intense up-front malt blast, perfectly balanced by the even more intense bitter finish. Very piney. Very heavy, quite dry. Overall, a great example of the style. I would definitely buy this again if only they sold it in Quebec...."
"O- I guess the question is """How do you make Ruination better?""" Simple answer is """double the hops!""" They've done that and hit a home run. Can't wait to see what the 15th and 20th anniversary brings!"
"Overall this one is slightly higher than the 4 I gave it but not more than 4.25 which is where I would put this nice big IPA."
"Overall this is a great IPA that I'm quite glad I picked up. Definitely better then the regular Ruination and quite and excellent way to celebrate 10 years of a great beer."
""
"Stone has always been one of my top breweries, and this beer solidifies their position at near the top of my list. Get this one while you can, drink it fresh, and cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice strong hop profile with tons of bitterness. Very tasty."
"(I must note that I had the second release of this beer and the smell was much boozier. Tingle-the-nose boozy as it warmed.)"
"As the bottle states, Ruination was a forerunner in the world of bottled double IPAs. This beer managed to kick things up a couple of notches. Congratulations on ten years Stone. Hop heads rejoice!"
"This is a good beer; taste doesn't quite live up to the promise of the nose & the mouthfeel, but quite nice nonetheless."
""
"Pours a bright copper color with about an inch or so of fluffy, bubbly off-white head. Solid retention and gobs of lacing. The aroma is of orange and grapefruit citrus, earthen hops, wet dirt and grass, and some bitter and floral hops. It tastes of lemon, orange, and grapefruit citrus galore. Some earthen notes in the middle, and some sweeter candied fruits. A bit of boozy ethanol towards the end. Mouthfeel is crisp, bitter, full-bodied in terms of flavor yet thin in consistency. Finishes clean with some warming ethanol. Overall, this was a great showcase of the glory of hops, but the amount of ethanol pulling through was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to dominate the aftertaste, and really stand out in the mouth. A lot of great things going for this one, but just too much raw alcohol coming through for me."
"O: A wonderful beer. World Class Double IPA most definitely. Stone rarely disappoints, this is another example of excellence in a glass."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, big, gritty orange citrus hops. In the taste, big, aggressive orange citrus hops, with a small alcohol note in the end. A mellow hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange citrus hop and a small alcohol not in the aftertaste. Big hops, small alcohol, that is hop a imperial IPA should be!"

"Not too overbearing. Definitely a treat to be savored"
"Amazing. This beer is mind blowingly good and if I could buy this year round, I would. Never been a huge Stone fan but after this, I am a convert!"

"Very drinkable and well integrated, though with pineapple acid it is a sipper.A bit boozy. Doug's bottle."
"Overall - What a monster of a beer. I got to drink a bottle a few weeks ago before this one and it was even more intense. Still, even now this is a monster. You must love hops, not looking for a balance between malts and hops cause this is a straight up hopbomb. Lets pray this becomes a annual release at least. Amazing."
""
"I like regular Ruination, but I like this special edition better. The 10th anniversary version isn't as tongue-punishing bitter, has more of a malt sweetness backbone to it, which is what I prefer. A little more balanced than the standard stuff. Very good."

"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, luscious, orange-copper coloring with a frothy, foamy, tightly packed off-white head that sits a solid inch and doesn't move. Fantastic. Aromas of resiny, delicious, fresh hops with a cedar, spicy, and rich blending of characteristics. Solid caramel sweet backbone and citrus blast on the nose, as well. The flavors are amazingly balanced. The hops come flying through, but don't overpower, which is an impressive feat. Citrus characteristics of grapefruit and tangerine are joined by passion fruit, pineapple, and mango to give an entirely tropical fruit feel to accompany the resiny, rich, bitter, and peppery hops presence. Very balanced, and rides a very smooth, slick body. Bitter and slightly astringent aftertaste cleans the palate and dries the mouth, inviting another mouthful. Slightly dry, very bitter finish that dares you to keep drinking. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for a 10.8% ABV and a hop punch that really delivers drink after drink."
""
"I am not religious, but God Bless Stone :)! This is great stuff!"
""
""
""
"Stone has taken the original Ruination Imperial IPA , doubled it and thrown in some Citra hops to the dry hop regiment. What comes out is an incredible imperial (triple?) IPA that easily reaches its goal of making Stone's original Ruination Imperial IPA taste like a hoppy pilsener. This beer is not for the faint hearted or the hop fearful. Make no mistake, This beer will put hair your chest; this beer will ruin your palate almost like no other. Grab this HUGE IPA while you still can. Highly recommended."
""
"Orange-amber color that is completely transparent. I love the way you can see right through this glass. 1/4 finger of head sustains and some lacing. An inviting and beautiful looking beer. One of the best looking DIPAs I have ever reviewed. Just as I suspected, very hop forward with the smell. Getting lots of pine, floral, citrus, some caramel, alcohol and esters. Lots of hops, as you would expect, but there is a substantial malt background that is present. This makes the beer more layered and complex. Alcohol is detected in the taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat moderate, with a great flow of carbonation from bottom to top. It does leave the mouth quite dry. Overall, I was really impressed with the appearance of this beer and of course the hoppiness and the great care that was taken into created a somewhat balanced beer. This is definitely a hop lovers beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. Can't wait until the 20 year!"
""
"Overall this is awesome brew. I would love to be able to try a draft version of this given how solid a month old bottle is!"
""
"The palate opens bruisingly bitter with rather pungent orange peel, grapefruit zest, oily orange zest, tropical fruit (mango and papaya) and mild pine. I can't overstate hop much citrus oil character is present on the palate, it is rather hilariously over the top (and fitting of the name IMO). So dank and resiny! Mild sweetness is present on the mid-palate, but is is complemented (and then dominated) by the hoppy flavors. Mildly boozy on the finish with a blend of pleasing bitterness, a moderate alcohol bite and a little toffee, this beer is a riot on the palate. The only other beer that I can think of that is so over the top is the older batches of White Knuckle (circa 2008). Medium in body with a medium-low level of carbonation, this beer feels nice on the palate. Kudos to Stone for brewing such a good TIPA and making it so widely available."
"As for the notion that it is a palate wrecker, the name Ruination is simply reinforced with this anniversary offering. It's not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for the fan of the east coast style IPA. Thank you Stone Brewing!"

"Served on tap at Jerry's. Appears orange with some cloudiness. Minimal head with significant lacing. Nose is full of piney resinous hops With significant grapefruit and orange. Grainy malts are present. Taste is bitter with heavy pine and resin finish is clean and well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied an the carbonation is mellow. Overall, very similar to the regular ruination with a little better balance."
"O- A good solid IIPA. I don't think it quite deserves the praise it gets due to it's complete lack of balance. While 'bitter' is a flavor, I hoped for more complexity."
""
""
""
"O- If Ruination ruins palates, I think a fitting name for this beer should be Annihilation. I hope stone decides to put this on a once a year release schedule. This is a hop heads deity."
"O- Stone did a great job with this beer and the 10.8% ABV is very well hidden. I feel this lives up to the hype, I hope that I can get a hold on another bottle or two."
""
"As it warms, the hops go from biting to sinus clearing and the beer develops an almost whiskey like character as the alcohol becomes domineering. Still happy that I bought three bottles, but don't think the 10th will replace the """Liquid Poem to the Glory of the Hop""" that is Ruination IPA."
""
"Beer is very dry, very strong, very bitter. It is sort of insanely bitter, this has to be close to the limits of detection, you can taste the higher alcohol unfortunately but overall it is a nice beer. If you like Stone you should drink this beer. I'll have it again."
""
"Notes: This was a solid DIPA. Nothing outstanding, although I tend to prefer more fruity (D)IPAs. Provides a nice bitter kick though. Well crafted and worth a try, though I wasn't impressed enough to splurge on another bomber (particularly compared to Enjoy BY)."
"The scent kicks this brew down a notch, there's a bit too much unrounded aroma going on with the nose. Recommended, but not worth the hype I heard."
"O- A great double IPA. Stone has done it again, but for me there are better ones out there. I like a bit more of a floral and piney aroma and a bit less bitterness. Nothing is wrong with this beer, it is great as a matter of fact, i just prefer something a little different in my Double IPA's."
"Overall, this does fit with the ruination idea, but it is a little more balanced than the original."
"Great beer. Just swap out this for the regular Ruination and the world would be a better place."
"Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. Although the flavor profile is quite similar to many West Coast IPAs of the style, it is amp-ed up thanks to the Citra dry hopping and surprising balance of hop flavor to hop bitterness. The extra ABV malt backbone I believe also contributes to the surprising """balance""" and I say balance for those used to hop monsters, not recommenced for a beginner, highly recommended for avid DIPA fans."
""
"It makes me sad that I will not be able to have this beer after I finish my last bottle. This is an amazing and well balanced brew. I hope Stone makes this into a year round or at least a seasonal beer."
"On tap. Pours a clear golden amber with a small white head that settles to ring and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass . The aroma is pine, citrus, booze, and caramel with sweetness apparent in the aroma. The initial taste is quite sweet with a bit of pine, caramel, and grapefruit. The finish is boozy with a bit of bitterness. Medium body. Low carbonation. A bit too sweet and boozy, but that’s not surprissing with a beer of this size."
""

""
""
"shes a hoppy palate wrecker for sure, I liked it but It's missing just a little something to put it into the World Class. Great beer but I was surprised too see it poke its way into the bottom of the top 100 list"
"Pours a clear orange with two fingers of creamy cream colored foam, a few rings of lace on the glass. Smell: big grapefruit, sweet orange, booze and tropical fruit notes. Taste: booze and sugar soaked grapefruit. Medium bodied, oily hop everywhere. Vote Ruination in 2012."
"This 10th Anniversary Ruination from Stone is a hop lovers delight and makes you say fuck you to Ms. Topper but you know damn well if HT came to visit you'd do whatever it takes to get yourself a taste. Stone is one of those company's that just makes great beer. I can't imagine what it would be like fresh on draft on the west coast."
""

"Overall-- I was happy to try this one, but I don't think it's any better than the regular version-- it's just boozier and more hoppy flavored... It isn't bad by any means, in fact I mostly think it is pretty good. It just isn't one I feel cowled to drink again."

"If this is how Stone celebrates Runiation's 10th anniversary, I can't wait 'til he turns 21."

" The flavor is great I love how the extra dry hopping adds to the perception of intense hoppiness based on the aroma, lots of piney grapefruit and light tangy hop flavors with subtle tings of pineapple and grass with mostly fruity accent from the yeast and peppery tinge from the hops accentuated by the alcohol which is there, but not oppressive. This is another great hop forward offering from Stone I am glad I got to try this amped up version of Ruination which is a great double IPA in its own right."
""
"Overall: Overall, super hoppy beer. One of the hoppiest beers I've ever had. Great stuff."
"O: Maybe the best beer that I've had from Stone. And if you know Stone's portfolio, that's saying a lot. This is a spectacular Double IPA, and I really hope that they brew this again. Happy 10th Anniversary, Ruination."
"O: An excellent tweak to the always outstanding ruination."
""
""
""
"What a fantastic beer. I would say it was hands down the best smelling beer I've ever opened. Wonderful citrus notes that never stop. The hops pound your nose relentlessly. Same goes for the taste. The citra hops dominate the front end and it turns quickly into a nice sticky pine bitter wash down the hatch. Truly enjoyable. It took me a while to finish the bomber, about 1.5 hours, but I enjoyed every minute."
"O - I personally think this beer is over-hopped, overly boozy, and over-hyped. It's all just a bit too much in every category for me. There's so many other (better) DIPA's out there that I'd rather have over this beer...too many."
"Overall I love the effort and props to the Stone crew for recognizing this staple style. I am honored to try this but the price will scare me away to play another day. A well done brew (as usual) and worth seeking out...but you better hurry."
"Overall: Very nice beer. If the pine was just a little milder it could be a 4.5 or 5 there as well. It hurts the drinkablity really. Still a must try brew."

"Looks good. Murky orange allows only the faintest image of my finger on the other side of my DFH snifter. Smell is divine: fresh, yummy hops. Interestingly, I think the base beer (and other IIPAs like it) are overly bitter while still too malty. This fresh fish here offers those tropical flavors of mango and pineapple. I call it fruity more than I call it bitter (I get the bittering now, don't get me wrong). Like a really good hop bomb, sheets of lacing leave a trail after the liquid swirls. The feel is great. It tastes great. This is probably the best beer I've had from Stone!"

"Big fan of Stone, and Ruination in particular. This anniversary version exceeded my expectations. Join the celebration."
"Notes: It goes without saying that this beer would be the perfect accompaniment to a very spicy dish."
"O: Tasty beer for a tasty event – I can dig ten more years of Stone bravado, and probably more. Though I’ll probably celebrate with a standard Ruination next time, this anniversary ale has certainly stolen my heart when it comes to hop tribute. Damn straight."
""
""
""
""
"Congratulation on ten years of one of the best IPAs, and best breweries on the planet!"
"Ruination is simply a great beer. While anythign can be improved, you can only do so much. Here, Stone has notched up the hops and the malt, but the extent to which one can perceive the change is limited. Pungent citrus hops are, as expectedly, in your face from the start. Malt is a bit sweeter than the regular Ruination, with some cotton-candy stickyness in the background. A big beer that drinks very, very big."
"O - Another delicious hop bomb from Stone. The strength is hidden by the overwhelming hop flavors and never got to a point where it was too overbearing with the 10 oz. pour. One and done with this beer though."
""
"Overall I really liked this last month. It has dropped off quite of bit since then but I still want to emphasize how good this beer is. It's a shame that the great flavor of Citra doesn't last very long in any beer. This is one I will be very curious to try in a few month or even a year or two just to see how is has changed but my advise is to drink it as fresh as possible. A must seek out!!"
""
"22oz bomber shared with my dad, who is new to craft! Poured a copper-orange color with a foamy ivory head that holds good retention and leaves some good chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are grapefruit, caramel, tropical, slight biscuit and toasted grain, some booze. Tastes are rich dank hop resin, pine, pungent grapefruit, caramel sweetness, honey, mango, booze. Mouth-feel is full bodied, chewy, syrupy, oily, resiny, finishes bitter but sweet also. Nice balance. Overall, I love that they amped up this one! 7.7% ABV for the regular Ruination is on the lower end of ABV's for bottled DIPA's these days. I thought this was spot-on and so glad I got my hands on a bottle!"
"Overall, I think the additional malts (and alcohol) make this seem a little more balanced and less one-dimensional than the regular Ruination. A fun big resiny hop bomb."
"Overall (4/5): This is a very good high ABV American Double IPA that is worthy of the Stone Brewing name: it is one aggressive hop monster. I hope to find a bomber of this to snatch up and drink greedily."

"Definitely a big winner from Stone. There is a slight imbalance to the brew, and may perhaps just be a touch too bitter. However, this is purposefully a HUGE beer, definitely take your time with it."
""
"Overall, while this is an impressive brew I really can't say I like it over Ruination of even Stone IPA. It is a little too one dimensional and over the top. Probably won't pick up again but I'm glad I got to try it."
"O: Enjoyable palate wrecking 2x ipa. Few could argue its assertive and aggressive dry hop nature that is overall balanced pretty well with the malt base.The hop fade is rather quick off the tongue but thats ok because it delivers a blunt amount of hops upfront that will leave you satisfied. Overall i would say this is very good, but find it hard to limit its flavor score of just a 4.0, smoothly bitter, well balanced, assertive hoppiness."
""
"M&D - the velvety tongue coating IBU's, the big grapefruit, the pine, this is a HOP BOMB! very tasty"
"O: This is a distinctly intense ale, with the qualities to shock and impress. The additional dry hopping adds depth and punch to this beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: every bit as delicious as the original and kicked up a notch. I'd like to see this one show up again from time to time."
"Finally I ran into this one! 22oz bottle Pours a very filtered yellow amber absolutely transparent with a nice 2 finger off white creamy head on top. The nose is in your face no doubt, huge dank and citrus combo, piney and floral with strong malt backbone and caramel. The taste just absolutely ruins your palate like I've never experienced. Melons and malt show up quick with just an absurd amount of slick hop oils and a big dry and bitter finish with a warming alcohol presence. Hop resin, caramel malt, orange peel, heat, boom. This is the biggest and most aggressive dipa I've experienced hands down. It's like a triple rainbow.... The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied and i would say this is not an easy drinker. Overall im super stoked i got to try this and am just in aw of how much bigger it is than the regular version.This is definitely not for the light hearted, if mike Tyson were a beer this is what he would be. Right to the gut, left to the jaw and he just knocked your fucking head off. And you're dead."
"Ultimately this serves to remind me why I love the regular Ruination so much...a hop-forward DIPA without too much malt or alcohol getting in the way. This, is nothing like that. Very hoppy, yes, but a lot of distractions going on as well."

"DIPA to die for. Big, bold, smooth and brash. San Diego style at its finest. Wish I could afford a case! Seek out immediatly-this one will not be around for long...pitty"
""
""
""
"Overall: This version of Ruination IPA on steroids delivers very well. Huge citrus fruit flavor and lots of spicy dank hops. A hop head's dream."
""
"Kind of a fun Double IPA being severely Palate Wrecking and very big, the flavors you do get through the bitterness are quite good, I only wish they would have maybe diverted some of those bittering hops to even more dry hopping."
""
"O: reminds me a lot of what Double Bastard would be as an IPA - very strong, rich, """palate-wrecking""" as they say; perhaps too much for some, but spot-on for me"
""
""
"O- I picked up 4 bottles of this originally. I drank 2 of them and am currently reviewing the 3rd bottle. At times I really enjoy this beer and then it gets a bit oppresive. This beer is definately a palate wrecker. Thanks Stones for another tasty beer experience."
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium orange amber. Half finger off-white head dissipates slowly to a film and ring around the glass with light lacing. Great aroma of pine and citrus hops, herbal. Promises great things. Flavor of intense pine and citrus hops over a sweet malt body. The malt is nonassertive but perfectly supports the powerful herbal hops. Appropriately piney hop bitter finish with residual caramel malt. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. Delicious. A truly dangerous IPA, I wanted to keep drinking this continuously, and had to pace myself because of the massive ABV. A masterpiece from the masters."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is super hoppy (obviously) with citrus zest, herbal hops, and some of the dreaded onion-like hop aromas which I wasn't expecting. Taste is actually quite sweet with citrus fruit, citrus zest, herbal hops, and some malt in there too. A slight onion flavor starts to emerge as the beer warms. The bitterness on the finish is actually pretty tame and starts to fade somewhat quickly after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that I think tastes better than it smells. Not a huge fan of the onion aromas and flavors however."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable beer, overall. Lots of sticky, weed-like hop characters that I enjoy."
"O: Its a showcase for hops, and a good one (I believe). A good beer to share IMO."
"OVERALL: Stone nailed it. I love Ruination, but I did not expect this to be quite so impressive. It blew me away. This is better than Pliny the Elder and it rivals the Younger."

"I dont remember enough about regular ruination to compare it to that, but this is certainly a great example of a hop bomb... and then some."
"Great DIPA, would love to see this more often, a hophead's delight; drinks fantastic for being such a massive & flavorful beer"
"great beer, an excellent homage to ruination."
"O This is a great anniversary beer. Definitely a step up from Ruination that doesn't deviate from the original beer. Make this every year.."
""
""
"O-A great DIPA, helped solved my toothache last night. Would gladly have this again."
"Good beer and the nose is definitely better than regular Ruination although the flavor falls just a bit short of that. I do have a weakness for overhopped beer so I love this one."
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"Overall, this is a great double IPA, and another hoppy winner from Stone. I'd love to see this and the 15th Anniversary constant staples in Stone's lineup."
""
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I'm a big fan of Ruination and this one surpasses it in pretty much every way. This is such a contrast to the Pliny the Elder I reviewed yesterday, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Stone clearly set out to wreck the palate and they've accomplished that with their Ruination 10th Anniversary IPA. Highly recommend trying this one. Get it while you can."
"This beer was worth the hunt. In fact, they had two cases left after I got mine. I might just go buy one, its damn well worth it, especially at $8 a bomber. This is easily a top tier DIPA and I'm loving every sip. Go find some, Cheers!"
"O: Just as crushingly bitter as I’d expect from a limited Stone release. As far as DIPAs go, this one is up there. It’s no Younger, it’s no Topper, but this is definitely one of the best Stone has to offer."
"Stone knocked this one out of the park. A beast of a DIPA, and one not to be missed by hop-enthusiasts. Get it while it's fresh my friends."
"Poured into my Stone imperial nonic a medium clear golden with a tinge of burnt orange a frothy 1/2 finger white head atop.Drunken sharp citrus fruit in the nose, a mix of alcohol and awesome hops just what would I expect from this beer.Flavors are deeply resiny with a leather note,overripe citrus fruit lends to the deep hop presence,sweetness comes from alcohol and a bit of caramel.Wow this is big,brash and beautiful in it's intense hops and high alcohol content,not for the faint of heart by any means.I was gonna mention this beer to a few beer novice friends,I think I'll mention something else.This beer is no joke."
"A twelve ounce bottle would of been enough for me. Finishing off the bomber was a chore because of palate fatigue. Will not be revisiting this beer. It delivers just what it stated it was going to do. Good clean hop qualities."
"Overall, a palate wrecker. A bit chaotic. Pair it with razor blades"
"I'm hoping that like Sublimely Self-Righteous, this becomes an eventual regular item. I prefer it to normal Ruination, and most other DIPAs."
"Overall: Color me thoroughly impressed. As an avid Stone fan and huge hop-head, this brew has set the bar for me for the Imperial IPA style. It's unabashedly hop-focused. It's also better than the regular Ruination. Stone, please tell me you have some sort of plan to release this recipe again, even if it's once a year and/or under a different moniker. It's that good. If you have a chance to try it, don't pass it up. I'll be stockpiling as many 22oz bombers as I can before this stuff sells out."
"This one pours a light bodied bright orange gold in color with a one finger white, sticky, frothy head. The nose is bright and super citrusy with a moderate amount of pine and alcohol. It's obviously very fresh. The Citra and Centennial hops are in your face. The flavors are hop atomic bombs. Citra everywhere. Centennial everywhere. Unfortunately there is plenty of alcohol but the ridiculous hop levels are welcome. The longer I sip this beer I get a trace of onion in the aftertaste. That and the alcohol are the only turn offs I see. This is a quality DIPA, yet perhaps overdone. I wonder what it would be like if it was 100% Citra, but who wouldn't? It has a lot f flavor but the booziness knocks the drinkability. It was worth the $10.99."
""
""
""
""
"I guess you've gotta try this if you see it, 10 years of ruination, it has almost been ten years that I have been drinking Stone....crazy. Real nice to look at, deep orange to amber with a dense crisp white head. Loads of lacing, but not such great retention. Smells good. You can certainly pick out the citra hops, also some pine, and fruit. Does not punch you in the nose, but fair. Well it is certainly bitter. Loads of hops, pithy bitterness, citrusy, and pine. However Stone has done a nice job of creating some balance here. Though perhaps too much crystal malt for me. Slightly thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good XIPA, especially for a guy who is not a huge fan of the style."
"overall, just a fantastic DIPA; one of those whole-is-more-than-sum-of-parts type enjoyability ratings for me. to hoppy beers what the finale is to the 4th of july fireworks show. and yeah, palate = ruined."
"O-this is a very decent ipa. The flavors are all pronounced, balanced, and of decent quality. I recommend this. It might be my favorite of the stone IPAs."
""
""
"Enjoyed this one while sitting around the pool on the 4th in the sun! Served from bottle into an RJ Rockers shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half finger white head that subsided to half a finger fairly slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine hop, grapefruit, citrus, grapefruit hop, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, tropical fruit, grapefruit, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I have always been a big fan of the regular version, so when I saw this one, I HAD to try it. It definitely did not disappoint. For them to have raised the bar on an already great brew, I have to give them a lot of credit for that. The alcohol is NOWHERE to be found on this one which is quite scary as easy as this was to down. A definite must try from Stone if you have not done so already. Would love to try this one Randalized (hint hint local bars)."
"D - Boom goes the dynamite? Completely unbalanced and goes for broke. Totally enjoyable."
"O - For $8, this is definitely worth picking up to try, especially if you are a hop lover. I'm glad I had one, but I had the chance to buy a 2nd and turned it down."
"O: This is a fantastic beer from Stone, and I was surprised at the price– $8 for a bomber where I am. Given the five pounds of hops they say go into a barrel of this, it's well worth the cost of admission. Huge, heavy hop flavors of many varieties carry this sticky beer up towards greatness. Pick it up while you can."
""
""
"This is a hoppy monster. It's harsh and ridiculous, It's very good, hoppy, resiny, great malt back bone, awesome beer again by stone!"
"O - Definitely one of my favorite new beers of 2012. Would love to see this become a regular, especially at the price point. A fitting tribute for 10 years of Ruination."
"Mouth - Strong ethanol that gives this beer a medium to heavy body. It'll get ya drunk. A good, strong IPA. A sticky mouthfeel that is more malty and sweet than bitter and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter, best by 8-23-22. This pours a nice amber color with a small short lived off white head. The smells are of pine, citrus, grapefruit and a little caramel. The feel is medium to thick. The taste is of hops lots of then, pretty good but a lot of sweetness, more balanced than expected."
"However, considered on it's own it's still a pretty good 4+ rating DIPA; just not the clean, dry beer that Ruination, Pliny and Heady are."
""
"Light, clear orange with blonde highlights when backlit and a creamy ivory cap that leaves sheets of sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is amazing, caramel slathered toast, pine sap and grapefruit zest all harmoniously working together to enhance the flavors of the hops and malt. Sticky pine tar, slight alcoholic heat and candied grapefruit peel with sticky caramel and a resinous, salty hop bitterness in the finish. Hop oily mouthfeel with mild carbonation. A big tasty hop bomb. Buy this beer, it is fantastic."
""
"O= This is a quality DIPA. Well worth checking out and living up to the name. Ruins your tongue."
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid, well-put-together beer...just not my preference for a hop flavor profile. Not one I'd grab often, even if it were available year-round."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a hoppy monster. It's actually not the most aggressively hopped DIPA I've encountered, but this is a good thing. It's harsh and ridiculous, but I actually look forward to finishing the rest of this bomber. It's very good, but I might actually prefer the """Classic""" Ruination. The malt profile on this is a little too cooked, and not exactly what I'm looking for. This is my only criticism. This is a must-try."
""
"O- Really surprised with this one. I've had Ruination many times over, but this one surprised me. A true hop BOMB that hopheads will be talking about for awhile."
""
"Overall a really special double IPA. Hopefully it will not just be a one-off but at least we will always have Ruination. It's the grandfather of double IPAs."
"This beer is not for the faint of heart (or weak of palate). If you don't like hoppy beers or if you're new to craft, please leave this one be. Don't try it, because either you'll hate it and write some crappy review which drags down its score, or you'll love it and there will be that much less for the rest of us to enjoy. This isn't a hop bomb. It's a nuclear missile of hops."
"O: Well worth a purchase, but this becomes a stinging, bitter barleywine as it warms. Drink cold among a few friends."
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
"Overall: Stone delivered on their promise. Double a double and you get this. Aggressive and on point. Also, I love Citra. Thanks for doing that."
"This beer is a hop lovers dream. It's loaded with hop bitterness and citrus, but I thought the mouthfeel could have been a bit more chewy. Definitely a sipper you want to share with a friend."
"O - I'm pleasantly surprised! Loving this beer! It's so well balanced that I can see a lot of palettes gravitating towards it."
"opened this bad boy last night out on the patio and i could smell the hops from six feet away. poured into a pint glass, this beer had a clear copper body with two fingers worth of creamy off white head. as i said the smell is big, couldnt wait to dump this down my gullet. aromas of orange and lemon mix with grapefruit and grass. while the taste was a little lesser than the aroma, it was still damn good. huge citrus hop flavors overpower whatever else is in there. a full body with excellent carbonation and a very oily feel to it lead to a short dry finish that left me wanting more. overall i would say very well done stone."
""
"Overall a good DIPA but I'm in the 'Standard Ruination' camp on this one, preferring its bolder bitterness and palate ruining capabilities. This one may offer better 'balance' but who needs that."
"Overall: A hopbomb that is worth giving a try if you're into that sort of thing."
"O - great nose. good flavors. a fitting homage to a tried and true beer."
""
""
"O- Glad I tried this one as it won't be around that much. Really damn good beer. Another success from Stone. Probably wouldn't buy it again at this price but I am glad I tasted beer history."
""
"For the price, this beer is a must. It's excellently balanced and incredibly drinkable."
""
"O: Good. What else can I say?"
""
""
"Overall.. a very nice dipa... was it my favorite? no... was it in my top 10 and something i would buy with regularity yet... still would buy a double jack over it if both were sitting on the shelf next to one another"
""
""
"Bomber poured in a stone 10th anniversary glass (I came prepared!!) when you open this beer the typical west coast tropical sensations take over. The color is slightly darker than the usual ruination yet beautiful. Listen folks, this isn't the best beer i had enjoyed.. but its damn near close. Be warned.. this is a STRONG brew. It would have been nice to have similar tastes to the original ruination, but you have to understand how much extra malt and HOPS went into this brew. I hope you all enjoy it as much as i have. 4.5/5"
"D/O: Nice DIPA executed with a mature and deft skill. Green Flash's Palate Wrecker is still more bitter, yet the full potential of the hops are well displayed here. Perhaps it is most surprising that Stone didn't try to reinvent the IPA again with this anniversary rendition, rather than just turn in another good one that fits in near the front of the current pack."
""
"o - stone never disappoints and this might be the hoppiest beer i've ever had. well done."
""
""
""
"WTF, happy anniversary to a beer that has taken over my palate time and time again and this is what we get ... a beer that is a palate destroyer. LOL, thank you Stone. Gratz!!"
"O: I am a sucker for Citra hops and this sure hits that spot. Just an all around amazing beer and I wish this was a year round beer. Also an amazing price!"
""
""
"22oz bottle $7.99 Bright orange color, looks a lot like regular Ruination, sudsy head. Smells like so much hops, dank, notes of pine and pine-sol. Extremely bitter flavor followed up by a bit of citrus and the a huge bitter finish. I am not surprised that I liked this so much because Stone knows how to rock hoppy beers. I may need to buy one more bottle before this stuff is gone, that is if I find it."
""
""
"O: Excellent DIPA from Stone. I don't remember the regular Ruination being this good, although I last had it very long time ago."
"O- I liked this DIPA, however I don't think it is anything amazing. The smell was great, especially when the bottle was first cracked open. The malts in the taste however dominated the hops a little bit too much, which ruined the taste a little bit for me. Still has a very nice taste though. It's been awhile since I've had the regular Ruination, I wished I picked up a bottle to compare. At $11/bottle I recommend at least trying it, you might like it. I however probably won't be buying more, there are a few other DIPAs for cheaper that I think are superior."
""
"These big IIPAs have been my favorite beers at times. Lately, I find many of them to be too sweet from sheer gravity or too vegetable from trying to hop past the high final gravity. Stone' s Tenth Anniversary Ruination is almost one of these """too big to pull off""" beers. Hell, it's drinks very different from Ruination, which is awesomely bitter but rather low gravity compared to many of today's DIPAs. But this beer, like slim few others I have had recently, pulls off HUGE without making a mess of itself. It doesn't taste like pumpkin or willow bark. It's not cloying. It actually pushes right up against the edge of disaster but doesn't O.D. It is huge, so I dont feel its relationship to Ruination, but its a damn well made beer."
"O- This is a great beer for sure. A hop bomb and very easy to drink."
""
""
"D - While I much prefer hoppy pales and IPAs, this is a very good take on the '3PA' style. Hefty doses of hops and malt, without being overly harsh or boozy. It was pretty easy to share a bomber with friends, and I'll probably buy another before it gets too old."
"Actually seems more balanced than regular Ruination I think. It's a slightly different beast, extremely enjoyable though. At this price I may pick up another before it's gone."
""
"good, but im much more into stouts and barrel aged beers this year. and i do prefer regular runination. nice to try, but dont need another."
"So, cheers to Ruination's 10th! It was one of the first good beers that I ever drank and one of the two (and definitely the better of that pair) that pulled me into the world of fancy beer. It will always have a place near and dear to my heart, and if it inspires future tasty beers like this, more's the better."
""
""
""
"O: Gotta be honest, Stone did an amazing job on this one, worthy of a notable anniversary. I wish I could get more."
"This is certainly a step up from traditional Ruination. I give it high marks."
"O: I reviewed this separately from the bottle version since I felt pretty differently about them. I didn't have the patience to let this one warm up, and the Rose generally serves its beers too cold, so not the best experience in general. I liked it, but I'd recommend the bottle more."
""
"Lucky my beer guy gave me this one. Pours copper with a thick, fluffy head. Smells of massive citrus and floral hops. Tastes awesomely bitter and hoppy. Ruination amped up just like I hoped. Great creamy mouthfeel. Outstanding! I hope I can get another one but I won't hold my breath."
"O - A very good brew. Reminds me a bit of Hoptimum but with more grapefruit juice. I really enjoy strong, tongue-busting DIPAs like this although it is the lower ABV, fruitier but extremely aromatic DIPAs that top my ratings."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a fantastic beer and if you enjoy IPAs of any description it's worth checking out. I feel, too, that it was a great way to re-introduce myself to Stone brewery now that my palate is more refined. It's definitely a hop-lover's kind of beer, and one you won't regret buying."
""
"This beer drinks very well for a nearly 11% beer. Its drinkability is impressive and reminds me a little bit of Pliny the Younger's drinkability. There are some slight reminders of that alcohol in the finish however. One of the better beers I've had from the bottle in the last year and I'm definitely glad Stone dropped this one on the market. It's a lot better than regular Ruination in my opinion. The malt backbone is so big and plays such a role in the flavor you could actually argue this is sort of a mix of east coast and west coast IIPA put together in one beer. Regardless of how you classify it, damn tasty."
""
"Great beer."
"Overall this is a hop lovers dream. If this is in the IPA/DIPA spectrum, it is for sure a Triple IPA; if it is an Imperial IPA, it is the Emperor. Many have tried to push the IPA past the 10% mark and have ended up with an overly resinous and cloying mess. While I have never had Exponential Hoppiness, this is the best extreme IPA I've ever had. It is a hop bomb, yet there is actually so much more to the beer. The malt and alcohol come together and really put a level of balance that I have yet to see. With a year on this, it could actually become something like a double hopped Bigfoot. Every true hop lover needs to try this brew. 5/5. Cheers!"
"Ruination Tenth Anniversary is a special beer. I wasn’t expecting anything close to this. It features an incredibly delicious hop flavor and is incredibly refined. The balance between malt and hops is really nice. The malts absolutely spotlight the hops while the hops never seem aggressively bitter. This is special! Find a few bottles and enjoy! Thanks, Stone!"
""
"Final note: if you, like me, figured that a nice dry-hopped Stone offering would be perfect for this hot Summer, I'd warn that this is not the most refreshing beer ever. This is more an after dinner treat for hop heads and alcoholics than an oasis for heatwave sufferers. The 11%~ ABV is not hidden."
"Superbly outstanding beer. Hop heads dream. They should really consider replacing Ruination with this recipe. Would not be obviously as drinkable, but what a statement this beer makes. Really enjoyed the experience overall."
""
""
"Some beers don't match their aroma...this one does. There is really no need for me to analyze this one too much...it is immediately the best DIPA I've ever tasted. It has malt backbone, it's syrupy, and the hops shine through. I love Hopslam, but this is now the DIPA by which all are measured in my book. Perfection."
"So, I am not terribly surprised by how this beer played out. I love ruination... but amping up a beer for a specual occasion does not by any means make that beer better for me. In this case I found the upped alcohol, malt bill and hopping took an amazing beer and threw it a little out of whack. This is still an enjoyable beverage and I am definetly appriciating alll the hard work that was put into it, but I am glad that it is a once off and not a replacment for normal Ruination."
""
"Bottle version sampled on 6/21/13. Consistent with the draft version, the bottled version is hugely bitter and dry, with barely enough malt to keep all the hoppy goodness in check. A little bit of this definitely goes a long way, though will try to see if I can knock back the bomber I bought today."
""
""
""
"Bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a glowing orange with a lovely, foamy off-white head. About a dinner width that disappears about halfway through leaving nice rings of lace. Smells of citrus, pine and some malt. Hops lead the way in the nose, no surprise. Taste is grapefruit, more citrus, orange peel and floral hops. Plenty of malt to balance out the bite from the hops. Medium-full body, playful carbonation, a bit sticky and syrupy but still above average. A great DIPA from Stone. Expected let's balance from a high octane Ruination, but far exceeds expectations of the style. Will definitely get more if available."
""
"Overall this might not have been quite as good as I expected, but if I hadn't been expecting anything I might have been blown away."
"I'm pretty sure this did, in fact, ruin my palate. I was planning on having another beer in an hour, but I think I might as well just have water and call it day. I say water, because I'm pretty sure this bomber just ruined my balance and reaction time as well. This beer was refreshing and fruity to begin with. It was a little resinous and thick towards the end. This is aggressive. I mean, it's Stone Brewery. One should expect it. Stone's aggressive nature is why I like them. Their aggressively hopped beers in regular rotation are great. It's the special one-off beers that tend to knock me off balance. This is really good, but not great. Great for a special occasion but wouldn't want it all the time."
"O: Well, they certainly made what they intended. It's Ruination 1.5 (Clown Shoes reference, anyone?). One of the few really big DIPAs that doesn't become a barleywine like 120min and doesn't become an undrinkable mess like Devil Dancer. Mega hop bomb, super caramel sweetness, all working together to create a surprisingly balanced brew (for a Ruination variant anyway)."
""
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma has a ton of grapefruit, with some pine and orange notes thrown in. There is also a hint of biscuit malt and some alcohol. The flavor is also full of hops and features a ton of bitterness. The grapefruit notes really stand out, as does some resinous pine. The alcohol is also quite strong in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A great Double IPA."
" fallout?!?! This beer is sick nasty. Great job Stone!"
""
""
"As you pour and smell the beer it is very difficult to find fault. As you work your way back the beer does come back to the pack a bit but we are still talking about a mighty impressive beer. For a beer labeled Ruination, who made its name destroying palates, there is an appreciable amount of balance. The hops are blended in such a way that no one note over powers another. Malt presence is rather low but makes crucial contributions in areas that allow the hops to shine without becoming overbearing. A tremendous beer, well worth seeking out."
""
"O: I like this beer, but it's a bit to harsh for my liking. If you're a true hophead, which apparently I'm not, then you will love this beer. But in my opinion, it's just ok. I don't think I'd buy another bottle."
" very similar to ruination in looks, smell and taste and still a well balanced beer. in fact for the 10.4% content it has a great feel and taste with little booziness if at all. i have a few bottles of this and i wonder how its going to age in perhaps 2 or 3 months from now. i feel perhaps it has just a wee bit too much edge to it and look forward to it mellowing a bit from that fresh hops taste!"
"O- Stone nailed this one. It is BIG, BOLD, and DELICIOUS. I can't wait to find another bottle. Picked this up in Oregon as it hasn't arrived in Washington state yet. Find it!"
"O: Marvelous. Highly recommended. Would have again. Top notch double IPA. Go to."
" Get this beer while you still can! Cheers!"
"O: For being such a huge hop monster, this has pretty damn good drinkability. I like this a lot better than normal Ruination. Just like other Stone beers, I like when they get higher in alcohol since they all have that great malt backbone that I enjoy and this one probably has the best of the bigger Stone beers I've had."
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation. There is a nicely balanced bittersweet aftertaste. As far as I am concerned, Stone hit a home run with this beer. I would like to see this version of Ruination stay around."
"O: Stone Brewing is one of my favorites, and this only helps to validate my reasoning. This brew delivers a perfect, and quite delicious, example of the DIPA style. Well done."
""
"Overall an awesome DIPA done in typical Stone flashiness."
"Overall a good beer, but I bet it would be better at 9% than 10.8% it's just too hot for me. I'm a huge hophead, but even this dank beer is just a little strong for a double ipa."
""
""
""
"O- A vicious monster of a DIPA, all the flavors are huge, drinkability is actually impressively high for such a big beer, this is a great celebration of what Stone is all about, making aggressive, bold beers, this is really great stuff."
"I love big hoppy beer; big hoppy beer that is """bright""" and more acidic, for lack of a better word. This is a decent beer but only a bit better than average. JMO"
"O - This is a good DIPA, but I must admit I’m a little disappointed. It looks really nice and smells fantastic. In the taste, I appreciate that the malty sweetness sticks around through all the bitterness, but it's a bit much for me in a DIPA. The mouthfeel is a bit too thick and sharp than I’d like also. The bitterness and alcohol adds a bite at the finish that diminishes the drinkability. Regardless, I’m glad I got to try it. Cheers to Stone for brewing a stellar DIPA for 10 years. Ruination will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first beer that I ever reviewed. I had my first Ruination only 4.5 months ago, but I’m a believer and I’ll still be drinking it when the 20th anniversary edition comes out. Here’s to another 10 years, Stone!"
"O - I was very excited to drink this. I am not disappointed, but I was expecting better, to be honest. Still a great beer, and would still buy it if it were available throughout the year, but I think I over-hyped myself a bit. Like I said previously, I prefer the taste of the classic Ruination, but the appearance/smell/mouthfeel of this one is outstanding."
"O - Definitely took about half a beer to allow my taste buds to kind of tune in to the bitterness but this is a fantastic brew. Very similar to ruination but even more more and much more alcohol with just a little more of an alcoholic burn/bite."

"O: yet another great brew from stone, these guys do not dissapoint, I hope they keep making this brew, because I love it !"

"Chalk this one up in the books with Younger, Expo, and Hoptimum."

"Overall: An automatic A+ and a palate wrecker for sure. This is another epic beer by Stone. IMO this is what a strong Iipa should be. One of the best Iipa I have ever had. This is a must try for Hop heads and Stone lovers. Drink this as fresh as possible because the malts will come through. Hopefully Stone bottles this permanently now and just calls it Double Ruination because this is an out of the park beer."

"This beer is amazing and I LOVE the regular Ruination. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up."
"O- I hope they get more bottles in, cause I would like to buy a few more and split with some hop-head friends. I love the way stone does hops. getcha some."
"O - A great hop bomb! Bitter pine and grass with some nice orange balance."
"O: One of the best imperial IPAs I've had! Nice hop aroma and taste with just enough malt to keep things in check. Pretty drinkable considering the huge abv. I might have to pick up a few more of these..."
"O: Pretty nice."
"Medium thickness and an oily hop texture in the mouthfeel. Very drinkable for the avid hop-head. Very enjoyable and highly recommended if you can get a bottle."
"O: This is one of the best beers to come out of stone. No I'm bold enough to say, that this is possibly the most satisfying DIPA out there. This is one very delicious beer that is unfortunately a limited release. Complex, delicious, devilish, and rich are the key words to describe this wonderful brew. If your a hop head, or just a beer lover in general, don't waste this opportunity to experience something special. So do I recommend it? I would buy a case of this, if I could... What does that tell you? Cheers friends!!! Savor Good Beer."

"Awesome beer, and glad I seeked it out and got one. Lives up to the hype for me. One of the better DIPAs I've had."

"Mouthfeel- Due to all the all the malt needed to get the ABV to 10.8% it is thicker than I like. 3"

"Pours orange with some light off-yellow soapy foam. Nose is citrusy grapefruit with plenty of weed and body odor. The malts come through in the nose more than anticipated with a crystal dominance and boozy sweetness. Bitter with a solid boozy character and a lingering citric rind flavor. Nice and sharp, but the hops seem to have difficulty dominating the malts here - this one is quite malty, almost some honey notes. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a watering finish. A nice beer, and glad it was the same price as standard Ruination (at least where I picked it up). If they were next to one another tomorrow, I'd buy the OG - cuz it's that fucking good."
""
"O - This is a fantastic DIPA. It really does ruin your palette."
""
""
"Poured into a Stone Ruination IPA shaker on principal. Pours a deep, coppery orange with a slight haze to it. Two fingers of pure white head with copious, tiny bubbles towers over the beer with lots of bubbles rushing up from the base of the glass. Lacing is abundant. The nose is dominated by piney and citrus hops, but has a surprisingly sweet background of sweet, caramely malts. The taste, rather surprisingly comes very malt forward, and then bam, the hops hit in the back end. They are lots of citrus and pine, grapefruit. The palate is chewy, malty, full, with a long-lasting bitter finish. Overall, I was very surprised at how much of the stage the malt takes in this beer. I would actually say I like the original Ruination more, but this beer is damn fine. Damn fine indeed."
""

""

"O - I am very impressed and actually like this one better than the regular Ruination. I saw some reviews that said this was too malty but I don't get that at all. This to me is a spot on example of a great west coast DIPA. Cheers!"
"A sipper that is sure to do its job... ruin your palate. If you like bitter over sweet, this is your treat. If you dont like hops... run!"
"Overall- An exceptionally good beer here. I think there will be comparisons made to some of the heavy bitters out there. I'm not sure if its up there but this is an exceptional beer in its own right"
""
""

"Pretty decent way of hiding nearly 11% alcohol too. Brutally hoppy, hefty, acidic. Well maybe not hefty, hefty sugar addition I guess. Nothing delicate here, but if you're in the mood for some alcohol & hop overload, this will float your boat."
"O: Get this beer. This is one of my favorite Stone beers. Well balanced and very good."
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden copper color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is extremely hoppy (what would you expect from a Ruination on steroids?). Lovely hops with a good amount of malt and pine sap. Very piney with faint citrus. Taste is initially like biting into a pine cone that is glazed with honey. A good amount of malt in this one...a little too much unfortunately. Still keeps that west coast hoppy flavor though. Hop resin bitter grapefruit and a hint of pineapple. Heavy malt richness in the finish...a bit of booze as well. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a surprising creaminess to it. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer, but I wish it didn't turn out as malty as it did. Becomes a little much as you continue to drink the bottle."
""
""
"Recommended...GREAT VALUE AT $5.99!!!"
""
"T: Oof. This thing is a beast. Big, aggressive piney hop notes with a ton of grapfruit pith hop resin. A touch of pineapple and mango evident on the periphery. Some faint bready malts creep in near the finish. Tons of resin on the finish. Super bitter and pretty delicious."
""
""
"Overall: This bears little resemblance to regular Ruination, which has always struck me as a very dry, light-bodied DIPA. Regardless, this is very enjoyable for what it is: a massively hoppy, bitter and boozy monster of a beer."
"O - I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this one, and I was not disappointed. Stone usually doesn't disappoint anyways, and this one was no different. And with a very reasonable price tag, you can't go wrong. If you're a hop head, you need to get your hands on this one!"
"This is a beer that is a bit shocking at first but as you move a long it is nice. Very acidic and biting, a bit of unhidden alcohol, but a nice one."
""
""
"Poured from a bomber. Beautiful Hazy orange with a nice lacing around the glass. Aroma is a big citrus hop bomb that lights up a nice grin. Feel the alcohol a little too much. Everything about this beer is world class, the alcohol needs to be hidden just a tad but overall a fantastic beer. Get them while they last."
""
""
"Just a really good beer. Got that, “Oh, wow, I’m feeling it” after just a few sips. I heard they went fast, but I’m going to buy a couple if I come across them."
"Despite the fairly generous amount of malt, this is pretty tasty. Despite the alcohol heat, this is drinkable. That said, this is much better cold; it's a bit of a drag as it warms because the alcohol and malts start to become more appreciable. The hops were very well done; it's a shame they're run off by a piddly heat wave."
""
"Overall – Coincidentally, this is a somewhat “balanced” beer by Stone, meaning it isn’t a 100% hop bomb. I will pick another for sure."
""
"Please Stone, make this beer year round. Perfect beer."
""
"O- good dipa and better than the regular Ruination too me. Abv is a little to noticeable and leaches a lingering mouthfeel."
"This is a great DIPA, but drinkability is hurt a bit by how bitter this is. It's pleasant, but I don't think there's any way I could drink a whole bottle of this. This is one to share with friends!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It really is a souped-up version of the classic DIPA they've come to brew. Its got a lot better balance; its actually kind of nearing the balance that Pliny The Elder had for me. Its not nearly as smooth, but from Stone, this is a damn fine showing. Good malt, good hop, big flavor and good drinking. This is a limited-time release, so if you love Ruination or DIPA's, this is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"O: I'm sticking with my original review. While this is good, the hops just can't overcome the insane malt and syrupy booze flavors. The result is pretty meh, considering how amazing Stone's standard and DIPA's are."
"Verdict: This is pretty excellent stuff, definitely a palate wrecker, which is certainly the intended mission. The high alcohol could probably be hidden a bit better, but the brightness and floral elements are really pristine."
""
""
"Absolutely everything about this release is world class. From the amazing deep orange coloring capped off by snowy white peaks of head this just hums on every cylinder. The nose is Citra dominated hops, so intense and gorgeous. The taste profile slides in in perfect unison, citrus fruits, mango, and pineapple dominate. The mouth is a balancing act of sweet malting and uber bitter hopping, 110 IBU that is so well balanced it's amazing. Not just the best brew Stone has ever made, one of the best DIPA ever made, an absolute joy to sip and savor."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice almost tacky. Hops are resiny and delicious. Alcohol isn't overpowering but I definitely felt the effects. This beer made me realize why I started drinking Stone beers about 9 yyears ago."

"Overall this is a strong beer that packs a punch, but the onion taste hurts it."
"Great golden/orange color. Initial smell gives off a citrus scent, but not too strong. Pouring from a bottle, 1/2 inch head, just the right amount of carbonation. I expected a power punch of hops with a rough after taste, but it went down smooth and had a very pleasant taste in the back that came on late. Great beer. I suggest out of the bottle."
""
"- Hard to say that any beer is perfect, but this is about as close as it gets for me in this style. On par with other top huge DIPAs out there, including Pliny. Dangerously drinkable and extremely tasty, all of the great features of this brew meld into something that is really special. I wish they'd make this a regular staple."
""
""
"A very good DIPA. Big bold flavors, but none become brash or over bearing. While not one I would feel the need to have routinely, I do hope I have a chance to enjoy this again."
""
"- I am already buzzing pretty good just from the lovely 'after-warmth' of just a few small pulls from this beer for this review. It's still relatively balanced for such a heavy number, while not showcasing any hard and sharp alcohol flavors. The body is great, the feel is great, and it is quite drinkable. This might be one of the better double IPA's as of late. As if the regular Ruination wasn't already?"
"Drink- It was good, wasn't great. I did grab another bottle to give it a shot in a better glass and more calm setting. (I might update this one)"
""
"Deep clear copper in color. Served with a minimal bit of creamy white head. Moderate lacing. Aroma is not nearly as potent as I was expecting, but what is there is orange juice, orange blossom, and pine. Flavor starts off with a good dose of pale malt and then turns sweet and hoppy with notes of orange and citrus and bit earthy on the finish. Alcohol is well hidden for nearly 11%. Moderate to aggressive bitterness, but again not as potent as I was expecting. Overall, and enjoyable beer, but was expecting a bit more hop character, both in the nose and the bitterness."
""
"The first half of the bottle was more pleasant than the second half. If I'd had one cold 8oz pour on draft at Stone I'd rate this higher than I did, but a full bomber with adequate warming shows me this is a pretty solid beer but overly malty and alcoholic while lacking the bright hop expression I find in fresh Ruination. It's more akin to a Barleywine than the Double IPA I was hoping for. Well crafted, but not the sort of beer I would buy again."
"Overall it's a pretty damn good DIPA"
"Way to stay with tradition for this ten year celebratory edition. this is the best Stone mash up so far. Take time to enjoy every sip of this one boys. Hurry up to secure your supply now or take the pilgrimage to the Stone Brewery, well worth the trip, ask Howie."
"O: A big monster DIPA for sure, certainly enjoyable, but nothing to go crazy for, I prefer regualar Ruination to this."
"O: Smashing example of an American IPA. Another example of Stone setting the bar. Good work Gents."
"O: Big, complex, balanced, and powerful. A nice tribute to a classic."

"Overall, well... I bought one bottle. I'm going back out tomorrow to get two more. It's a great beer. I'm reminded of Pliny the Younger when drinking it. For the $6.49 a bomber, it's a steal. Go get it, drink it and enjoy it before it's gone."
"A world-class DIPA. Better than Ruination."
