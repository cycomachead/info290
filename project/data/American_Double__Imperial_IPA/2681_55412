The price point near my house ($15.49/4-pack) makes this a few and far between type of beer, but if I saw it at a restaurant, I would certainly order it.","huntley101888","Wednesday at 06:12 PM"

Glad they got rid of the summit this year, as the onion/garlic could definitely throw the balance off a bit. Definitely worth trying now, though","BEERMILER12","Monday at 09:30 PM"

The Sorachi Ace, Chinook and Mosaic hops combination gives it a piny evergreen hop flavor with a hint of lemon.  It is the malts that really make this different though.  Rye and North American Pale Malt and Munich Malt give off a spicy flavor I do not think I have ever tasted in a DIPA.  Started off really loving this beer but as I finished beer 1 and started beer two (20 oz pours from my growler) the flavors are starting to become a little overwhelming.  At 10% abv this is a real ass kicker.  If you are a hop head well worth the try, but this strikes me as a beer that you would either love or hate.","mweso2000","Oct 24, 2014"

I don’t know if they could top it in 2015 if they switch the hops up again. ---- On tap for $3.50 a pint at brews brothers. Really like this beer. Happy to see it added on tap by me. Love the sweet caramel taste with the pungent summit hops. Very well balanced. Nice juicy citrus happyness.","kkleu357","Sep 18, 2014"

I have never smelled one like this, heavy on the mango/cantaloupe/and whatever those little oranges are called.   The same dominates the taste,  with some strange bread like qualities, and some alcohol notes and burn.  The mouthfeel is thin, with the carbonation trending low.    Something has me wondering what this is like fresh.  Should have checked the date, but this was the first time I saw it, so the assumption was made.

It's just one of those strains that can do no wrong. The nose in particular bursts with mouth-watering tropical aromas. Smart use of rye here too.

My biggest problem with hi-res was the alcohol taste. This beer blows hi-res out of the water. It's far and away the best imperial IPA i've ever had. Huge hits of candied grapefruit and nectarine followed by a nice, faintly piney hop bite. The back end is more citrus with some malt. Perfectly balanced, outstanding. Pours a delightfully bright yellow-amber. I could not recommend this beer any more strongly.","FormulaQ","Jun 05, 2014"

I understand they probably use better ingredients but when you can buy a case of an adjunct lager for the same price, 90% of people would probably do that.

I usually don’t enjoy beers that some might call “Triple IPAs” – ales that seem to get a pound of hops for every pound of malt – mainly because they end up oily, oniony, and in the end, undrinkable (think Founder’s Devil Dancer). But there’s something to this beer that gives it a fantastic drinkability and a hop character that’s not overdone. Dark German malts instead of caramel? A hefty dose rye in the grain bill? Who knows. Whatever it is, though, it makes this a beer worth revisiting. Cheers.","BarryMFBurton","May 10, 2014"

With so many great beers of this style available, paying 15-20 bucks a four pack needs to be weighed into the equation. Try one if you can, it's a 3.75-4.00 beer if money is no object. If money value is important to you, split a 4-pack with friends.","Bonsall_Phil","Apr 23, 2014"

3.92,2.6,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"This ale pours a beautiful reddish amber hue with a slight off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is a bouquet of dank citrus and floral hops. The aroma is very fresh and inviting. The mouthfeel is on the thicker end of medium bodied and coats the palate gloriously with hoppy bitterness. The flavor is a purely bitter hop bomb, that (while delicious) does not seem quite as fresh as the nose. This imperial ipa is trying to achieve the dankness of something like Enjoy By. It is good but doesn't quite hit that mark. Definitely worth trying though.","lochef81","Apr 20, 2014"

I say it comes with the territory, and if you’re looking for something different within the style, this is a very good bet. Worth the price? A can or two, at least once, yes.

4.43,16,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From my tasting notes: The beer poured a golden amber with a generous white head. I got a hint of onion in the aroma like I had heard, but more of a sweet onion with a base of sweet citrus and tropical fruit. The taste was a bitter hop monster that erupted in my mouth like biting into a grapefruit rind. The Gubna was big, bold and full of hop dominance with a blast of grapefruit and dank resinous hops. The rye malt gave the brew a spicy malt balance and a great lingering taste on my tongue. This had a very strong balanced bitterness that was delicious and surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. It got a little boozy as it warmed, but that’s to be expected with such a high ABV.","brurevu","Aug 26, 2013"

Highly recommended, especially for those who favor rich, malt-forward brews and want to venture into getting more out of the hops side of the equation. And with the higher ABV, it also makes for a great cocktailing beer with friends on the deck on a Friday evening.","BuckeyeSlim","May 31, 2013"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is much better now that they have changed the recipe away from hops with onion and garlic notes.","UCLABrewN84","May 29, 2013"

The complexity is very nice and the taste is interesting, to say the least. About the only issue I have with it is the price- it is quite costly, even for an imperial IPA.

There is an almost tea like quality to the hops and a deep resiny bitterness follows as the big malty sweetness rides through the finish.

Yes, there is a sort of grassy onion brothiness that takes over the back end. The flavor is full of hops...bitter, oily grapefruit, spicy rye, pineapple, and resin. A little sugary, but not overly sweet or anything. Fullish, creamy body and bitter. A solid, pungent, warming DIPA. Surprisingly not way over the top, like I was expecting.","wedge","Apr 19, 2013"

Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, light caramel, honey, pine, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes, without being overly sweet; though it is pretty muted for a DIPA. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, light caramel, pine, floral, grass, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, light caramel, pine resin, floral, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and good complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a slick and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice DIPA.

Now that its a seasonal I might pick up a four pack next year and revisit with the Gubna.","Frankinstiener","Apr 03, 2013"

3.79,-0.8,4.25,4,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and it was a slightly above average example of the style, this DIPA was big and bold, but I thought it was a little rough around the edges and it lacked the refinement that some of the best of the style have. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and it was fairly filling, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, but with the high amount of bitterness and all the other factors I think one would be enough for me and I wouldn't feel like drinking two in a row, one is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was was pretty good and the lacing was really nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the lack of drinkability, it wasn't smooth and it doesn't really keep me coming back for more. I might buy this beer again, but if Hopslam, Double Trouble, or Lagunitas Sucks are on the shelf then this beer will be overlooked, and it was a little overpriced, I recommend it if you really like DIPA's but I don't think it has the quality's to be a top tier DIPA. All in all I thought this was a solid DIPA, but I don't think I will be revisiting it soon with all the other great DIPA's out there. Now that I finished all the beers that they released to Michigan I think Oskar Blues is a pretty average Brewery, I was dissapointed in a couple of their beers and I didn't find anything that I really liked, but I'm not going to rule out anything till I try Ten Fidy, till next time Oskar Blues. Old Chub still seems to be my favorite so far.","StoutHunter","Mar 31, 2013"

Hoppy, but not hop flavors are not dominating everything else, and a great appearance and mouthfeel compliment the hops and the strength of the beer. I feel this is a damn good beer, and it's dangerously drinkable as well. I want another one but I know I'll get loopy and regret it later if I have another one.

It looks a shy cloudy apricot color while the moderate foamy halo settles around some surprisingly generous lacing. And quite pretty to look at too - it falls like intricate lattice work. The nose is right away biscuity sweet straight into sticky citrus fruits (mainly ruby red grapefruit, subtle cranberries and pomegranate, along with a slight whiff of peach) and over time as the beer adjusts to room temp more of the delicate pomegranate and cranberry notes prosper. This reminds of Green Flash' 'Le Freak' in that regard though I'm not sure what type of yeast Oskar Blues utilized for GUBNA. Medium carbonation and typical viscosity for the style on the mouthfeel. At 10% abv this does drink deceptively well with virtually no alcohol heat on the finish. Next time, I will be sure to crack one of these after it's acclimated from the fridge to the kitchen table as I am discovering with most beers I have tried with higher abv's that they're even more palatable when the chemistry of the beer has been altered by those varying change in degrees. Ultimately, definitely another winner from Oskar Blues right here - a brewery that has never disappointed my drinking experience.","looseteeth","Mar 15, 2013"

There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, orange peel) hops, along with some grassy hops and bready malt. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, this brew is all about the citrusy hops. There's also some light rye spicyness noticeable, along with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good beer, but I don't think it's $12.99 a 4-pack good.

Further thoughts include lemon candy, pineapple, grapefruit, and a pleasant malt backbone. A certain spiciness develops toward the aftertaste as the citrus notes unite to form a warming sensation at the back of the throat. I will note that the taste seemed muted to a certain degree with the beer itself seeming mildly flat. Yet for a canned DIPA, I enjoyed this one.

Starts out on the sweete side with fruits and citrus, then goes to semi-sweet citrus, then to bitter, then to dry and almost ouckering. Even the carb has a wonderful transition/progression to it. The flavors are all bod and delicious and work so well together. Very complex. The flavors are balanced in that they work so well together, and the transitions must be experienced.

Pine and grass notes with some undiscernable spiciness. Very unique taste, pine, spruce, and fresh cut grass with an edge of spiciness possibly from the rye malt, finishes smooth with piney hops bitterness and booziness somewhat blunted by the abundant malt. One of the largest malt backbones I can remember, medium carbonation, and on the lighter side of full-bodied.

3.92,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Has the fairly typical hazed orangish-amber color with a brief flash head and no lacing for a high ABV IPA. At first whiff upon cracking open the can there is a relatively strong blast of green onion / garlic but given about one minute of settling down in the pint glass, the garlic pulls back in intensity and allows the aromas of grapefruit and tangerine over toffee malt and earthen mustiness to shine through. The flavor is a lot more spicy and dankly resinous than the nose had me expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise. Starts out very slightly to the drier side of your typical IPA but finishes slightly on the sweeter side in the finish, tapers off with a light onion and alcoholic heat rising up in the aftertaste. After letting the glass warm up for a while I get some additional flavor nuances of green leafy herbal and mint tones in the midsip rounding things out. The malts present as a balancing palette of spicy rye and graham crackers. Medium body thickness and carbonation levels.","WastingFreetime","Aug 02, 2012"

The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of sweet malt and citrusy hops. There are some piney hops in the aroma as well. It's a very bright smell. The flavor is dominated by intense citrusy hops and sweet malts. Some of those bitter piney hops come in at the back end. The aftertaste is bitter, but pleasing. The body is full with adequate carbonation. It is smooth, but also thick and creamy. The drinkability is very high.

Little to no citrus here. The taste is an explosion of hops. VERY bitter, with a decent pine influence. Again, this is not a citrus variety DIPA, and there's absolutely none to be found here. Zero. There's definitely some onion overtones here, which is interesting. The mouthfeel is on the sharp side of bitter. This is a palate wrecker for certain. Overall, a decent beer.

3.8,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a can and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazy, bright, orange-yellow coloring with an inch of foamy, light, off-white head that slowly recedes down to a filmy covering. Aromas are smooth and rich, with a roasted caramel backbone, some sweet and tart grapefruit and navel orange, and resiny, slick fresh hops. The flavors are rich and roasted, with a super tangy sweetness from both the caramel backbone and the resiny hops. The citrus sweet notes are joined by a pineapple characteristics that blends well with the stronger ABV and hops profiles. A decent peppery jolt at the end helps to keep the aftertaste light, leaving only the slightest hint of tangy caramel sweet and hops bitters. The finish has a decent linger, although it slowly dries from the hops and ABV, so the palate ends up clean and clear after a bit. Very solid DIPA.","GarthDanielson","Feb 21, 2012"

4.19,9.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Can poured into snifter. Aroma is that of grassy, citrus and slight fruit hops. It is a good aroma but is not a strong one. Appearance is golden orange, with sea-foam colored head. Taste is fruity, pineapple or honey dew melon tasting hops. Seeing as this is a 10% alcohol this beer tastes awesome. The taste has almost no alcohol to it. Palate is medium bodied with a resinous sticky mouth-feel with light carbonation. Long, tasty finish. One of my favorite double/imperial IPAs.","stabzmcgee","Oct 17, 2011"
3.78,-1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Off-tap in Syracuse this beer was a rusty orange color with one finger of khaki colored head. The retention was decent and it left streaks of lacing. The aroma was of pine, pineapple and grapefruit. Boldly hoppy with very little detectable malt. The flavors were similar with the added addition of alcohol heat, a little tropical sweetness and a little cookie dough malt. If you don’t like green, gargantuan hops you wouldn’t be into this. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium-full and the carbonation on the low end. Drinkable and punchy but a little one-sided.","thekevlarkid","Oct 11, 2011"
5,30.9,5,5,5,5,5,"I have not reviewed in a very long time. Simply put, this is the best double IPA I have ever had. Significant hops balanced perfectly with the malt profile. I always felt that Gordon did not really fit the double IPA category. So it is nice to see Oskar Blues put forth the Gubna, which is a fine example of a DIPA. That alcohol sure sneaks up on you. The only downside is the price, which I will now definitely pay in order to imbibe this tasty brew!!!","ChrisA","Oct 07, 2011"
3.6,-5.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Verdict: This IPA certainly wont pander to a hop head, but its good in its own right. Reminds me of Dogfish 120 minute. A big bold IPA in a can. Looking forward to sampling more of Oskar Blues.","kevanb","Oct 03, 2011"

3.77,-1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This is a more piney than citrusy IPA, a characterization that often leads to a lower rating for me. The sensory impact of the high ABV doesn't help either. The overall score of 4 may indeed be too generous.","chinchill","Oct 03, 2011"
3.64,-4.7,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the fresh, varying hops throughout the taste. The mouthfeel also struck a nice balance, with a hoppy dryness, but a thicker coat to cool the palate. This beer is decent for the style, but the generous inclusions of alcohol, at times, seemed to detract from the potential of the beer’s flavoring.","TheBrewo","Oct 01, 2011"

3.83,0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The body and carbonation are both mid-level, which lends a nice solid backbone. Bitterness is assertive, but not over the top for a DIPA. Overall the hop character is not as harsh as I expected for an all-Summit IPA, but does have a sharp quality. It's an interesting hop, but I think it would be better as an accent to something with a lot of citrus flavor, rather than the showcase in a hop-forward beer. I would buy this again though, as it is an interesting and unique hop-bomb.","dpasotti","Sep 26, 2011"

4.5,17.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very smooth for a 10%er. I really enjoyed the cloudy light golden autumn color when I poured it. A sweet plum to smell most definitely. A great starter, but an exceptional closer. Hops through out with a glaring mouthful of malt... However, it is deliciously done! A must for all Imperial IPA fans!

4.82,26.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I'm a little surprised at the deviation on this beer. I personally think that this is a fantastic beer, and I love the very herbal hop profile. I guess if you don't toe the line with citrusy/piney hops, you won't please the California posses. Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. After many cans and plenty of this on tap, decided to review it. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a creamy off-white head. Smells super piney and herbal, and fresh, fresh, fresh, with a nice orange rind finish. The taste is also fantastic, with more of that fantastic herbal quality with dill, a touch of chives, orange, and a bit of a yogurty tang. Nice spice and pepper finish from the hops, and enough sweet malt to support the huge, fresh tasting hop bouquet. Delicious.","Georgiabeer","Sep 04, 2011"
4.89,28,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall I love this beer. In my opinion its one of the most unique and tasty DIPAs on the market. The only beer that i could compare it to would be Founders Devil Dancer. But this is way better.","lbower860","Aug 29, 2011"

If you truly, and I mean *truly* love hops, this is your beer. If not, you will truly, *truly* hate it.","jondeelee","Aug 02, 2011"
3.7,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Gubna is very interesting. The pepper and woodsy smells and flavors are unique to it. I will say that it's not like other imperial IPAs I've had.

Overall, Gubna is really a winner. It's just an outstanding DIPA, and I really can't see how someone who would like, say, Maharaja wouldn't like this. I know plenty of people say """onion""" with it comes to this brew, but I don't get any. It's got to be a personal reaction thing with the Summit hops.","shand","Jul 18, 2011"
3.31,-13.4,4.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Not really what I expected - the hops seem to be off - no clean, crisp citrus/pine effect here, just an earthy dullness that overrides the other universal attractive attributes - a good looker, that holds its booze very well.

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a nice hazy orange color with a 2 finger white head which has good retention and leaves a nice lacing. This smells mostly of citrus and pine hops a little malt in the background. The feel is medium with expected carbonation, lots of hops coat the mouth. The taste is pretty good, there is an initial sweetness, maybe some orange, grapefruit and citrus followed by lots of a dual sweet / high bitterness on the way down. Overall a pretty good beer, I prefer a little less sweetness but that seems to happen a bunch with this style.","DavidST","Jul 15, 2011"
2.77,-27.5,4.5,2.5,2.5,4,2.5,"This beer pours a hazy orange-yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a thing cap of foam that lingers. The aroma is of rotten grapefruit and pine resin. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with a strong bitterness that masks some of the rotten fruit character. There is also a strong alcohol heat in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is an average beer at best. With so many DIPAs out there I cannot see myself revisiting this one.","KarlHungus","Jul 12, 2011"

3.53,-7.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thick foamy head (about 2 fingers worth) sits atop a light burnt orange ale. Sweet malt in the nose. The taste is dominated by caramel malts. Sweet and thick, syrupy. Bitterness comes through, pine sappy, grapefruity bitterness, without any real hop leaf presence. Medium bodied, with medium carbonation, provides a sharp alcohol sting in the back of the throat. Didn't really stand out, but I'd probably buy it again in a pinch.","ggilman","Jul 11, 2011"
3.04,-20.4,3,4,2.5,3,3,"This beer is too one-dimensional for me. Strong flavors of bitterness overshadow the nicer, but more subtle, aspects of the beer. No depth or layers here.","jtingue","Jul 09, 2011"
4.4,15.2,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"This is real close to being a top 3 imperial IPA for me. Of course I’ve never been disappointed from anything I’ve had from Oskar Blues so far. I defiantly see why the price is a little high on this particular beer.

3.97,3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a golden to slightly orangish color with a white head that did not last very long. It appears to have some chill haze. The aroma is huge: grassy and citrusy american hops with some clean, sweet malt aroma. The taste starts with big hops, some perceived bitterness from hops and alcohol, and finishes with some sweetness. The bitterness really dances on your tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium with a slight alcohol warming. This is a drinkable Imperial which is an important quality of Imperial IPA's. It isn't nearly as complex as some but a clean, enjoyable, and well crafted beer.","alexkeil","Jun 30, 2011"

Carbonation appears to be light, almost no bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is lighter than expected, and is of sticky piney & lemony hops. 1st sip brings a totally unexpected hit of sweetish malt, with some very dry piny hoppiness on the background. I was expecting to be bowled over by the 100 IBUs of bitterness, but it's quite subdued. The mouthfeel is of medium heft, neither heavy or watery. Maybe almost five months of aging has mellowed it a bit? Overall, I was expecting a more """in-your-face""" experience from this brew.

Resinous garlic, onion and pine hops dominate my nostrils with their spicy aromas. I look all over for some malt, but aside from a fleeting bread type aroma I can't find any. If I close my eyes, take a big whiff, and think about tomatoes I've got spaghetti sauce in my glass. Taste is actually less hoppy than I would have thought from the nose. The malt is much more present with its bread and caramel, but it barely masks the pine resin, garlic and onion I get from the hops. Long lingering garlic resin after every sip leaves me longing for olive garden bread sticks. Full rather syrupy and resinous mouthfeel, Medium to thick body and light level of carbonation. I have mixed feelings about this one. I could not drink much of this, but I applaud the effort and the out of the box thinking. I think this beer is a great style expanding experiment, but I feel for my tastes this beer hits some notes that my palette may not be ready for.","johnnnniee","Feb 12, 2011"

I love when I can continue to solidify my list of favorites with more proof that they're awesome. Gubna poured a clear pale orange, almost peachy color, with a thin eggshell head breaking into wispy lacing and thin patches. Sticking my nose into it, I came away with pine, a weedy marijuana/hemp, and a zesty bite of bold pink grapefruit. All together it was very bright, but dank, and I had a hard time finding anything sweet in it - hops all the way. Once in my mouth, the pine dominated my palate, closely followed by waves of lemon-rind hops, grass, orange peel, and pink grapefruit. By the end I had a thick, bitter aftertaste of dry pine on my tongue, regardless of the lighter mouthfeel. The carbonation added a nice spicy twang to all of the hops, almost rendering it """springy.""" I found that it reminded me of SanTan's Count Hopula with all of the pine and grapefruit running amok, which is in no way a bad thing as I find Count Hopula to be one of my favorite beers. If you need a way to wake up in the morning, skip your coffee and dip your tongue in this - note: I'm completely downplaying the punchy bitterness here.","Lucklys","Dec 01, 2010"

Heavy with grapefruit, then fading to oranges. Leaves a pretty bitter finish. I'm looking for the wild onion or garlic taste, but all I can discern is a hint on the aftertaste. Perhaps contrived, it is there lingering in the background. As you get through this, the hops mellow out and sweet caramel malts become more and more prevalent.

There's no explicit garlic taste, but there's a similar spiciness to the hops in addition to the expected citrus aspect. Besides that, there's a pronounced caramel maltiness midpalate that's a bit too heavy for me. Gives it that syrupy maple-syrup-on-grapefruit character. Definitely more in the west coast barleywine vein. No alcohol in the taste but there's an obvious warmth in the chest after each sip. Bitterness is firm but not really up to double IPA standards.

If you're going to sell this, categorize it differently or something. QC may have just botched this batch. This beer is undesirable in every way.","liquidcraft","Jul 13, 2010"

The nose comprises a haymaker of hoppiness, as though a citrus blend (like those from Dole) was cut with a healthy amount of pine sap. There's also a sort of leek-like character in there as well, along with what seems like some spicy pepper. After this assault, a meek contingent of light caramel tries vainly to pitch a tent on the ruins. The taste follows in lock-step, with a hefty amount of oddly peppered hoppy bitters and leeks swarming the tongue, followed by a comparatively faint bit o' caramel. The hops...the hops... The body is a fairly hefty medium, with light carbonation and a somewhat chewy feel and sticky finish. Overall, an experience, yes, but not the greatest in the world. I think it's the pepper.

The rye is very pronounced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This isn't the best DIPA out there. It's malt forward with tons of complexity.

Slightly chewy body, a little sticky. Nice flavors but I find this one a little under attenuated, my most common complaint with these huge DIPAs.

No lack of grapefruit, orange citrus in the nose, however, most marked by peat moss and lichen sort of scrub notes, charcoal ash and then scone to biscuit breadiness, followed on by golden raisin, peach, apricot scents, pine and honey, sweetens as it warms. Medium-bodied, the carbonation comes off a bit too """fluffy""" as if masking the lack of natural heft. Loses a lot of the herbal dimension here, milk chocolate and vanilla pair up with the tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus for a sherbet like mix. Biscuit to corn bread more than """bready""" per se.

Can't say I like it but it really makes me wonder WTF it could possible taste like (not this I hope). The flavor is an intense sweet potatoe turnip and floral perfume in a near full bodied brew. Tangy intense swampiness with a herbal hop bite. It's sort of bright with relatively fine, full carbonation, full bodied and viscous and hard to ignore. But I doubt I will ever buy more of this.

In the end, this is why you blend hops - to get a more balanced beer with a variety of flavors and aromas. I learned a lot about the character of Summit hops but I guess you have to be careful how you use them. I'd recommend trying it once to decide for yourself.

Aroma was bursting with fresh cut green onions it almost made my eyes water, shar earthy garlic spiciness kicks in as well. Biscuit malts slip through and let you realize there's some malt balance going on. Flavor was just rough for me, blast of strong booze from the highe abv, minimal hop bitterness a bit sweet actually, but the hop flavors that came through didn't sit right with me green onion and garlic in my beer doesn't work, well maybe if it was Mama Mia's Pizza Beer. Mouthfeel is rough as well alcohol doesn't go down smooth I don't like a burn with my DIPA. This one sears the nose hairs, carbonation was moderate and body was fuller no a bit resinous and oily with the Summit additions.

There are flavors of orange and other citrus fruits, with a prickly mouthfeel followed by the warmth of 10% a.b.v. This is not a mouth-puckering IPA that just resonates with dry, resiny hops.

Taste is sweet up front, almost sugary, not so much citrusy or melons, more like cane sugar, with a full-mouth feel and bitter finish, but not too sharp, the sweetness cuts into the hop presence.

The hop profile has some grapefruit and tropical fruit notes, there is some grass and pepper as well. The feel is of a huge malt body, very heavy on the palate but not overly sweet.

Raw, leafy Summit hops add a very flavorful balance to all the IBU's, with pine resin and wild herbs. The malts taste sweet and pale with a spicy rye kick, but ultimately get overshadowed by the hoppy onslaught. The booze takes hold mid-palate, and grips the tastebuds with a breathy ethanol note until the 10% ABV warms the stomach. One of the longest-lingering aftertastes in recent memory, and I like it. Mouthfeel is deceptively light and drinkable, but you can tell this is a big beer all the while. I guess the uppity carbonation level helps lighten the load.

The hop character is both complex (shockingly complex for a beer brewed with a single hop) and extremely pungent with a particularly spicy leaning. This hop intensity is mirrored in the flavor with strong notes of grapefruit and other, more subtle hop characteristics that combine well with the rich malt. This combination of malt and hops comes together particularly well in the finish and aftertaste, where it creates a woody tobacco character that highlights the moderately toasty notes of the malt.

Overall this had huge hops but was still somehow very well balanced, leading to a great scent and taste. It had great body also, and hid the alcohol all too well, so it was dangerously easy to drink.

Head eventially settles into a fairly consistent skim of a cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Lots of lacing with excellent adherence on this brew. Nose starts off with citrus notes initially, but there seems to be a slightly herbal/medicinal quality that follows close behind, as well as perhaps a hint of something vegetal - garlic and/or onions? Taste consistent with nose - WTF - there is something a little off-putting about the taste for me. Another review cited a Funyuns taste. While it's been years since I've had a Funyun, there is definitely an overpowering oniony/garlicky character to this beer that comes out in the middle and peaks at the end as a not so subtle reminder of what you just tasted - all this on a very malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and syrupy viscous with an even carbonation level. All these factors, coupled with the price, makes Gubna a major swing and a miss for me.

This is very tropical, spicy, decidedly sweet, though not terribly viscous given the high ABV. Rye is evident, melding with the hops to create a pronounced spiciness not dissimilar to fresh rye bread with garlic spread. The finish has a firm bitterness which borders on, but never quite reaches, astringency. It's quite juicy, never really reaching the dryness of a West Coast IPA, but also lacking a heavy malt profile, with a hop bitterness that's intensely resiny, like sucking on pine sap.

The aroma is mouthwatering with tons of mandarin orange sweetness, pineapple and other tangy acidic fruits. The nose is also bolstered by a fair amount of malty sweetness that gives the fruits a candied sort of aroma. Initial flavor is quite sweet, sweeter than many doubles, but has a nice bitter edge to it. Similar to the nose this beer drips with citrus and pineapple and has tons of tropical punch character. The more I sip this, the more of the bitterness I get and I am finding it to be one of those beers that gets better as it goes down. I am really not getting any of the garlic notes that so many people speak of, though there are some very interesting flavors that remind me of the hotness of a good raddish. Definitly a complex brew, and I cannot stress how pungent the bouquet is on this bad boy. If it has a downside, I would say it is the mouthfeel. Medium bodied and somewhat slick, yet with a sticky finish that seems to be equal parts sugar and bitterness. Not picking up any alcoholic warmth until it gets in my tum tum. Despite all this is remains quite drinkable and I regard it as a fine new double.

For a 10% abv DIPA, I expect more. On the other hand, a lot of the flavors come out quite nicely in the flavor. The hop bitterness is strong but there are complex flavors to it - flowers, pine needles, grapefruit, cannabis. The rye spice is quite good; the general malt flavor is more interesting than most DIPAs. Unfortunately, the beer just doesn't drink as big as its alcohol content would suggest.

Bitterness was solid throughout, but stayed nicely balanced with big malt and fruity sweetness. Alcohol was forward, but not hot. More tropical fruit with lingering bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation, very smooth and viscous.

The juicy and estery hops are very pungent in this beer. There is a slighly booze soaked pineapple layer here, lots of sweet malts, and a barley wine type consistency. There is a cloying, and unpleasant biting sensation on the back of the tongue from this beer that I'm not happy about. It is as if some raw hop cones got out of line and wanted to produce a crude harshness and bite on the tongue. They succeeded. This needs to be tamed. There is a load of ABV in this beer and it does nothing to hide any of it. This is a strong, thick, syrupy DIPA with lots a very good qualities, but the biting and harsh bittering sensation really detracts.","albern","Apr 02, 2010"

Nose and flavors consist of alcohol, ripe pineapples, other tropical fruits such as mango, citrus-y orange and tangerine, caramel, a of bit dank weed, some pine, candy coating like on a candy apple. The taste does not live up to the complex aromas, but it is no slouch either. Just not mind blowing. Body is bit lacking with decent carbonation.

The first taste is some syrupy malt somewhat similar to a barelywine, with an intense very strong bitter finish and the expected alcohol warmth. This is surely intense! (coming from a lupulin threshold victim). But the citrus hop taste that I thought I detected in the nose is not to be found here!

Pours a pretty bright orange, 1-finger foamy white head is kept alive by numerous carbonation bubbles. A bit of sediment floats in a standstill. Leaves good lacing. I could smell this easily while pouring it, a seriously STRONG citrus smell, it's like sticking your nose inside a tangerine. Also picking up somewhat dank, earthy notes. I'm taken a bit back on my first sip. A seriously sweet tangerine taste. Ripe orange peels if you rolled them around in hops, dirt, cannabis, and sugar cane. I still can't stop smelling this one, the nose is insanely fresh smelling. Any trace of booze is really hidden by the strong tastes. Almost like a beer-version of one of those strange Dole fruit combo drinks (orange-pineapple-pomegranate juice). Definitely unlike any other IPA I have had. The flavors here are pretty excellent but I think they're a bit over the top, the sweetness is way too high. If it was toned down or balanced better this may enter Sculpin-esque territory, because the fruity tastes here really are great. Mouthfeel is good, very oily and a little creamy. Carbonation is at a good level, booze is very hidden until the end when it shows slightly. Drinkability I gotta pin at a 3.5, the sweetness gets to you, and the price ($16/4-pack) is pretty much inexcusable. I'd say pick up a single and try it out, definitely worth trying at least once.

The heavy bitterness just sticks around, bombarding the tongue. Crazy, and doesn't seem to want to fade. It's a little drier due to the crazy hop bitterness, but still sticky sweet from the heavy malts. I think I could call this beer a triple version of Gumballhead.

Alcohol and hops is all i can taste. I can detect no caramel or grain taste. This is a one dimensional brew...hops delivery vehicle, and I am in love. Grapefruit and lemon peels, and I swear I am finding very slight green onion. For the thin body and good amount of carbonation the aftertaste is minimal but bitter all the way.

4.71,23.3,3.5,5,5,5,4,"D: This is fantastic, it blows away Gordon without even trying, sorry Gordon. Nice sipping DIPA.","Halcyondays","Mar 15, 2010"
4.62,20.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a nice golden amber color with a foamy white head. The nose is amazing loaded with grapefruit and citrus with notes of fresh cut grass and pine. It was hard to let the aromas go long enough to take a sip. The palate is full and round with some distinctive hoppy notes, not your typical hops either. The hops all most have a hint of caramel which is quite welcoming. Overall one of the best colorado made Imperial IPAs","WhatsNewinBooze","Mar 14, 2010"
4.62,20.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Great Imperial IPA! The appearance and bouqet are brilliant. This will not be my last Gubna.","chicano4craft","Mar 14, 2010"
4.41,15.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Finish of big citrus oils and pine. This big hoppy beer can hold it's head up high with any of the complex and popular hop head brews.","GRG1313","Mar 13, 2010"
4.47,17,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - All I can say is wow. For 10% abv, this is a dangerously drinkable brew. The flavor and balance are both excellent, and the lighter body for such a big beer lets this one go down so smooth. Gubna is definitely making its way into my regular rotation.","GarrisWH","Mar 11, 2010"
2.79,-27,4.5,3,2,4,3,"It's a good looking beer with good texture, and probably a valiant effort for people who don't get onions from the hops. However for me it's a total dog.","Domingo","Mar 11, 2010"
4.2,9.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: really liked this beer. thought it was true to the style of a double/imperial IPA. if you like Dale's and like IPA's you won't be dissapointed.","ATGHomebrewer","Mar 09, 2010"
4.13,8.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I try to avoid hyperbole. This business has WAY too much already. So I will simply say this: Just when you think the last thing the world needs is another Double IPA, Gubna comes around and sweeps you off your feet. Well done Dave, well done.","BradLikesBrew","Mar 08, 2010"
3.93,2.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"The body is moderate. Very easy drinking and no real off notes. I would have expected a bit more astringency but very clean. Overall a good DIPA that is more along the fruity side. Im sensitive to simcoe and there seems to be a bunch here.","Oxymoron","Mar 07, 2010"
3.59,-6,5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,"Tastes potently hop flavored with strong hop bitter and an accompanying flat alcohol sting. Carbonation is strong and contributes to the assault, too. Hop flavors are so potent they almost come across as syrupy and sour. Lotsa green onion and baby aspirin. Plum skin, blood oranges, lemony pith, sand (like from a sandbox, not a beach). Weedy. Hop bitter is multi-dimensional consisting of a clean bitter and a raspy cohumulone bitter. Malt flavor, if any, is lost beneath the hops. Could be some esters of plum, but it's hard to tell if they are esters or from the hops. Very abrasive ending from the hop bitter, alcohol sting, and lingering super-hopp flavor. All in a dry mouth. Thick mouthfeel, which is strange that it can be so dry in the aftertaste.","mentor","Mar 05, 2010"
4.29,12.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is one of my favorite OB beers...been tending toward more malty beers but this may sway me back to the land of hops.","nicholasisrossi","Mar 05, 2010"
4.54,18.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"It's very drinkable and it's definitely one of, in not my #1, favorite from the Oskar Blues line. I think I'll have another!","tturaiders","Mar 04, 2010"
4.52,18.3,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Overall a fantastic version of the style. The tap handle showed what must be the eventual packaging for the Gubna - A rusty maroon colored 12oz. can. Note to self: look for said can in stores soon.","GilGarp","Feb 10, 2010"
4.6,20.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Medium to full body has great carbonation and a lasting finish. Great beer from Oskar Blues. Right up there with their best.","rye726","Feb 08, 2010"
4.45,16.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Was considering ordering a pint of this after my sampler. If anything, that should say something as it was begging me for more.","jwhancher","Jan 29, 2010"
