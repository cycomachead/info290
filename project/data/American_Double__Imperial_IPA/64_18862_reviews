"O: The hops are very well done in this beer with loads of flavors and just enough bitterness for balance. Nothing is harsh or overstated. A pleasure to drink."
""
""
"If you've had this in a bottle, also try it if find it on tap.  I experienced a big difference in flavor and aroma.  I wasn't crazy about the bottle but loved it on tap."

"The oak barrel-aging adds a really nice touch to what's otherwise a pretty ordinary double IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I should revisit this one as it's been a few years since I had it, but as with most beers, I feel like this one would be better off had it not spent any time in a barrel."
""
""
"O - As someone who's not a fan of the hop aggression of most DIPAs, I really enjoyed this. Very well balanced and complex."
"Excellent smooth,smoky IPA with a creamy oak flavor"
""
""
"Not much smell. Taste is a combo of a quad and iPa.  Interesting."
"Great beer. Has a bit of boozieness , but not what I would consider too much.  I would definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Exceeded my expectations. Very delicious, complex, and well-crafted beer. Dogfish head does it again."
"O: Really hard to score this one. I'm a self proclaimed hop head so I love a good bitter kick in the face. This one is very smooth, well accented with hops, but on the malty sweet side. In my personal taste, it's good, and given that it's a partially oak aged blend, I would say it turned out quite well. Maybe not as hoppy as I'd like, but still enjoyable."
"Best damn beer I've had thus far every thing about it is phenomnal. Flavor is out of this world."
"Poured from a bottle into a spiegelau IPA glass. Cold it drinks as an IPA with some oak characteristics as it warms to room temp more of an oaked barley wine. Very solid brew from dogfishhead. I can't recall the last time I tried this beer (several years) but I am definitely going to be keeping some on hand from now on. For me it's as good as 120 IPA."
""
""
"i can see how some one might like this, but i think its gross."
"By far the best beer I've tried from dogfish head. I'd drink this any day of the week. It's not a session beer but I crave it daily."
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: After reading several reviews on this one, I see a lot of people mentioning the matly taste and comparing this beer to a barleywine of sorts, so maybe 5 months on this doesn't change the taste much. It's getting better as I'm getting drunker. Still a bit off, in my opinion."
""
""
"This is a great beer. You can find characteristics of both styles, and scents and flavors of oak come through in a good way. Supremely smooth and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was surprisingly good. I was sure at a abv of 10% I would get a good burn when drinking this beer. Its surprisingly smooth. I think I'll have seconds on this one."
""
"Malty and woodsy with a hint of caramel. 3 sips and I was feeling something. The fact I had no idea it was a 10% says a lot about the drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"mostly brown see through body, almost white head.  Caramel and malted almost barleywine like taste. Alcohol, malt, sugar and funk in the smell. Old prunes and yeasty wine in the taste. Heavy mouthfeel. very woody like oak. Any citrus is deeper older orange type thing. some vanilla in there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very carbonated mouth feel. Very hoppy initial taste with oak woody flavor at the end. Almost forgot this was 10% abv until the buzz hit.. Haha. Creamy mouth feel... Awesome beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is pretty amazing and thoroughly enjoyable. The perfect balance of flavors and another Dogfish classic, I will definitely be stocking up on this one!"
""
""
"Aged a year and 2 months roughly"
"Overall an amazing beer.  Great complexity, and surprising drinkability for being 10% ABV. I definitely recommend trying it."
""
"Just an excellent, excellent beer. I liked it the more I went on. The smell was better than the appearance, the taste was better than the smell... Burton Baton is a must try. The bottle suggests maybe cellaring this beer, but I wouldn't ever do that. The fresh, bursting hops is what makes this beer -- the barrel just adds a bit of depth. If you see this beer, pick it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at DFH Fairfax. Similar aromas as 90 min plus roasty/malty notes. Caramel and ripe red tropical fruit right off the bat. Slight hop bitterness overshadowed by creamy/malty flavors on the finish."
""
""
""
"Overall: the citrus intensifies as does the malt character with warming. The oak masks the alcoholic finish. Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very impressive!  I wasn't ever a fan of oak-aged beers... Until now!  Fruity old ale and oak flavors blend nicely, reinforced by sticky hops and sweet malts.  Love it, another home run from DFH."
"Killer beer, want another to keep, to age more"
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty, sweet malts, floral hops, dried dark fruits."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced malt and hop ratio. Watch out for this one 10% abv is not apparent."
""
"This is one hell of a brew, it is exactly as advertised. Get the IPA upfront followed by the best flavors of whiskey in the finish. Balanced perftectly and alcohol is not present, nice warming effect. Dogfish Head delivers and you have to try if you get your hands on one."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most balanced oaked beers I've sampled. No flavor is too aggressive nor do I find myself yearning for any additional edge. A must try... At least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The best damn beer out there. Period."
""
""
"Living in a state that doesn't get DFH, this is my first Burton Baton and I'm rather impressed. Phenomenally well-balanced with sharp, bitter hops, gentle barrel flavors, and sweet but not cloying big malts."
""
""
""
"This was quite tasty but it was just a little too sweet for me. It had that typical dogfish head sweetness and syrup like qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid Dogfish offering. I admit that i tend to shy away from them because i find them to be one of those gimmick breweries. But this one is pretty good, if not too sweet for my palate as i find a lot of their beers to be. The oak aged characteristics meld nicely with the caramel malt and citrus hops. It opens up more as it warms. Its good fresh, and i am planning on aging a few to see how it all comes together."
""
"A great sipper.  Enjoyable to the end.  I've had this fresh and now this one with a year on it, and I would say that I prefer it with a bit of time on it."
""
"I absolutely love this beer."

"Nice beer, try it for a chance. Worth it!"
""
""
""
"While this was good the oak pit me off a bit. I am just not used to that showing up in a beer. Without the oak I would have rated it higher."
"V - Worth it at any price."
""
""
""
"Pours clear honey with a small white head, smells of hops with roasty woody notes slightly boozy, tastes boozy and hoppy with cooling caramel and roasted malt undertones, creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish."
""
"I think this beer is exceptionally smooth for the APV.  Try it, you'll like it!"
""
""
""
"Glass- Boston Lager perfect pint"
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer! Great bitterness with a smooth quality when sipping. Should have picked this baby up a long time ago!! Sweet but not in typical imperial ipa way."
""
""
""
"Excellent flavor feel. Highly recommended brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice old ale style brew with some good flavor and aroma.  Sips nicely and very enjoyable.  I've been meaning to have this one for a long time and I should have gotten around to it sooner."
""
""
""
"Dogfish Head comes through again. Subtle spices."
""
""
""
""
"Great Imperial IPA. Only thing is it is just a tad too sweet (honey) tasting for my tast."
"if I only get one beer to drink, this is it"
"This beer is much better tasting after bottle aging for 6 months, and even better after a year.  The longest I aged was 1.5 years, and it tasted the best.  It's a really good beer either way, but I'd put the taste at 4.25 for drinking it right away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber in color. Somewhat sweet with a spicy aftertaste that fades somewhat quickly. Not a bad ale at all ,very enjoyable"
""
""
""
"A blend of a barleywine and an IIPA. It takes the strengths of each and synergistically synthesizes them into something that is greater than the some of its parts."
"Dark and strong!  Like motor oil to the pour.  Very strong stuff!  I liked it a lot.  Just be careful... It will get you there quickly!"
"O: The IPA aroma and bitterness blends nicely with the sweetness complexity of the old ale. The subtle barrel characteristics adds an additional layer of complexity. Overall a very creative and impressive drink. Drink fresh as the oakiness and the dry hops begin to fade in about 3 months (see bottle date on the neck of the bottle). If you cellar this you'll find yourself with a sweet old ale after 6 months or so (which is less interesting than this ale fresh in my opinion). With several years of aging this could become an amazing American barleywine (or a boring one) but I'd drink it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a fantastic beer fresh, super enjoyable. I am bewildered how Sam hides the monstrous alcohol content in between all of the layers of flavors. I'm really excited to age this beer and see what happens when the hops mellow and the English Old Ale thread of the mix comes to the forefront."
""
"I drank this a few years back before I really liked IPAs. Need to try again, but I remember it being a decent beer"
""
"Oak on the nose. Malty backbone on taste."

"O - An outstanding beer. A definite go to for imperial IPA drinkers. The blend of the young and the old I think keeps it very drinkable, so the oak aged qualities don't squash the IPA."

""

"I've had this several times over the past few years, and always loved it.  Incredibly rich and complex blend of flavors.   Well worth the $4.50 it costs around here ... for a beer like this, it's actually quite a bargain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I very nice IPA, well hopped but not oppressive with a wonderful aroma. Adds some interesting depth to a normal IPA without deviating beyond recognition. Obviously not a session beer based on the alcohol content, but sure drinks like one."

"Overall:  great imperial.  Balanced well.  Not too oaky.  Would have scored higher if aroma was there.  Will buy again."
""
""
"Man! Dogfish continues to out do themselves. What a great beer. In the world of carbon copy IPAs this one stands out in my brain. The oak adds a delicious darkness to this beer and almost a little bit of vanilla! Definitely worth pickup up although it is going to cost you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful copper color with milky white head with decent carbonation upon the pour.  Aromas of oak and maple, which also come through with the taste.  The mouthfeel is not too thick, and this makes for the perfect autumn/winter beer.  The hops come through strong, as does the alcohol, but the overall aftertaste is smooth and balanced.  The aging in the oak of the two batches creates even more complexity in this brew, but doesn't have an overall woody taste.  As for Double IPAs, this one is the best.  This is also in my personal top 10 favorites, rating only behind Caldera's IPA.  Dogfish head does it again!"
"An outstanding ale. I wish it had a bit more on the aroma side though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This might be my favorite beer from Dogfish Head.  I really like the 90 minute, but BB has more complexity."

"June 8, 2012 bottle on date. Sweet malt and wood, some oxidation. Hops and alcohol are barely there. Wish I had a fresh one to compare, but this is definitely solid witb some time on it."

""
""
"Superb beer."

"deep ruby red color. 2-3 fingers of head with aggressive pour. decent lacing. smell is of dark fruit-raisin/apricot and floral hop. woodiness is prevalent. deep oaky sweetness, floral hops, heavy toasted malt. full bodied. alcohol is noticeable and makes it a little hot. this is an interesting brew, i drank it fresh...but i wonder what it would taste like aged."
""
""
""
"I really like this beer. It doesn't bash me in the face with hop bitterness like most DIPA's"
""
""
"O - Most excellent.  It's making me hot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Always surprises me how much I like this one. It's like a barleywine with enough bitters to balance the syrup and booze. Ages well, drinks great while fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Hazy golden color with with white head. Aroma of flora, hops and yeast. Taste of vanilla, hops, yeast and a sweetness. Bitter aftertaste. A good beer"
""
"I like this one. It's right there with 90 minute. I get a little less alcohol than I do with 90 minute which is odd since it's higher in %ABV. Being on the west coast it seems everytime I get a Dogfish Head brew it's at least a couple months old. I'd love to try both this and 90 minute fresh, but even at a couple months the hops and oak really shine through in this one. A really good beer.  You just can't go wrong with Dogfish Head!!"

"DFH's most underrated beer. A great DIPA that knocks you with big hop and grapefruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: very well executed feel. The vigorous carbonation makes this very big beer more drinkable than it should be. The finish is dry, making me want to take another sip. I gladly will."
""
""
""
"This is my favorite beer, hands down.  It first hits you with its imperial IPA taste, then your mouth quickly discovers the English ale malty flavor, the oak peeks through just enough, and then that 10% abv slight sting hits as you swallow it.  For a 10% it's quite smooth.  Just a rich, satisfying every time, brew."

"Pours a hazy, copper color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Slight retention and slight lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, yeast, hint of pale malt, hint of roasted malt, and slight caramel malt.  Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight alcohol, hint of pale malt, yeast, and a hint of roasted malt.  Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, feel, body, and blend."
""
""
"Great whiff of woody brown sugars on the pour.  Very soft, subtle nose.  Solid taste profile as the toasted malt with notes of caramel foundation is big enough to sit equally with the lemon-lime citrus hops.  Hints of vanilla turn up on the tongue in the finish.  ABV is very well-hidden."
""
"O: I think I like the 2012 better, due to the """bite""" of the hops having not been mellowed by aging. However, it is interesting to again note the differences in and aged beer from a """fresh""" one."
"This is one beer that has a near constant presence in my fridge. Slightly hoppy (although the 70 IBU is masked very well) and dangerously smooth. Traces of oak and vanilla blend with the hop and the 10% leaves a slight heat feeling at the end. Perhaps the best balanced beer I have ever had, I find its warmth pleasant and comforting in the fall and winter yet the drinkability translates to a beer that is fantastic for sipping in the warmer months. While it is a bit pricey I would not pass it over. Give this one a shot if you haven't yet - you will not be disappointed."

"O:  the oak-wood taste is real ... I like it a lot, but the caramel taste is not my thing; fortunately, this brew is not syrup like 120 Minute, so I'm not fighting just to drink it.  American DIPA lovers would HAVE to love this brew, because it's got all the classic notes with the added taste of oak-wood."

"Parting thoughts – Descent beer but not worth the money. I get the impression it did not get a proper oak ageing (perhaps it was not a good wood?). Better at room temperature but still has an odd essence. Not sure it would benefit from any bottle ageing."
"O - This was unique. The melding of big IPA elements with an oak aged beer is brilliant, balancing two big flavors to make a more subtle, deeper final product. One I'd like to actually cellar out of curiosity; I want to see how this ages. Brings something fresh and new to the IPA game."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This never got close to a drain, great beer!!"

"O - Really delicious taste of hops, malt, super floral and herbal, strong, near full bodied, full of flavor and great from start to finish."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I haven't tried a lot of DFH's BA efforts, not through lack of interest but mostly lack of availability (and my own ignorance). This one is so big, boozy, sweet and woody it strikes more like a light barleywine than a double IPA. I'd love to taste one of these with a few years of proper cellaring, but it certainly is wonderful right now."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A: 92-95; If you see this beer and haven't tried it, it is worth the steep price-tag."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty dang delicious. I don't know that I'd drop $13 for a 4-pack (bought a single) but I'd consider it if I ever saw it on tap, or maybe even another single if the mood struck me."
""
""
"Overall, simply an outstanding brew that i wish I could get on a regular basis. Great stuff."
"Bought in a growler from Lowe's Foods. Touch of sweetness hides the alcohol well. Really unique flavors. Good color and texture. Delicious. I have tried the bottled version since and found excellent as well. One of my favorite DIPAs. Looking forward to my next growler."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 5/14/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, bread, oak, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, oak, light vanilla, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, bread, floral, grass, light pine, oak, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent oak aged DIPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/floral hops, oak, and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"04/29/14 From Bottle at home. Very much like the Great Divide Rumble I had last night. It's a large 10% ABV but that's where the advances end. There is a stronger sense of barrel aging but less body. There's lots of vanilla but it's not sweet in any way. I like it but...if I'm going to use my ABV consumption allowance on the 10%, there are others I'd go to first."

"It pours a great golden color, as most IPA's do. Smells just great with the hint of the aging that was blended as well as the hops themselves for a DIPA. Surprising smooth finish for me. Very almost velvety quality to how it goes down. I could have a few of these and be in deep trouble without even realizing it. Has the smooth oak aged feel but still has the bitterness at the very end that lingers nicely. If you get a bottle or are thinking of getting one, I highly recommend it. Very good and different take compared to the burgeoning number of DIPA's out there. Treat yourself."

"This really is good, good beer and a good throwback to the ORIGINAL extreme brew Burton ale (from Ballantine brewing, originally only for VIPS and not for sale to the public). I just feel that if you hunted around at the beer store, you can find much better hoppier brew for a lot less."

"Pours dark amber with a one inch head and solid lacing. Boozy to the nose with hints of honey and wheat. The taste is very boozy. It starts sweet and finishes malty. This is a full-bodied IPA for sure. Not a beer you can get through quickly. If you let it sit in your mouth too long it leaves a really boozy aftertaste. But if you chug it down quickly, the honey taste serves to cover up the bitterness fairly well. I wouldn't recommend chugging it down too quickly though-- this beer will kick your ass."
""
""
""
""
"Great flavor, slightly bitter, crisp and fresh. This is a very clean and crisp IPA, a winner Dog Fish Head, bravo, and with an ABV of 10% you'll think your fishing on a summer day."

"The yeast smelled of potato bread and honey. The beer didn't have any potato flavor but the sweet finish could have been a honey note but didn't smell that way in the glass."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I like it a lot. Balance of sweet and dank hops. Reminiscent of Hopslam really but clearly more available. The oak comes thru. Only strange thing for me was the lack of nose. The taste is really special though."

"Dark amber in color with a hazy complexion. A good inch of tightly knit off white head rests on top. Light Brussels lacing. Fantastic aroma is a blend of oak and piney hops. The mouth is dry and the texture is creamy. The front of the palate is piney hops and then the earthiness of the oak eases in and sticks with you well into the fade where it intensifies. The alcohol is well hidden."

"Overall: I prefer this over the 90 minute, but barely. I keep comparing it to the 90 Minute, because to me, it's so very similar, but slightly different. The main difference is it's just less bitter, and less strong hop flavor. Maybe it's a bit sweeter, but I give this the edge over the 90 Minute. One of my favorites from Dogfish Head."

"O: I'm running out of words to use here... Burton Baton has earned my first perfect 5 in the flavor category and is damn near a 5 in the overall category. I'm not sure what's holding it back, and maybe a 2nd exposure will earn it that coveted 5 in the overall category... Until then, just know that this is absolutely my favorite brew to date and I tip my hat to everyone down at DFH for brewing such an absolute delight of a beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer has a copper/amber body with a dense inch or more of light tan head. The aroma brings sweet bread, dank hops, bread, booze. Robust and bold. An agressively hopped beer with a big malt body. Sticky and resinous. Without a doubt one of the better offerings from Dogfish Head. Some tangy citrus, lightly sweet. The oak character is mild, which is probably a good thing. Overall, an interesting beer and one is have again."
"I've had this in my fridge for awhile and finally decided to crack it tonight. This offering pours a handsome but unremarkable hazy orange with a thick foamy white head that lasts throughout the pour and leaves a very thick frothy lacing. The nose is quite sweet and malty with just a hint of hops and some vanilla oak notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasant with a great coating of the palate. It is definitely on the thicker side of medium bodied but given the taste one relishes in the lingering flavors. The flavor is outstanding. Deep and rich with malty sweetness yet fresh with a hop bite. All this is accented by the rich buttery oak and vanilla flavors from the aging process. This is a great beer and worth every accolade it has received. If you are looking for a hoppy dipa, then search elsewhere; but if you want a boatload of balance and richness, then look no further."
""
""
"O: It's ancient for a DIPA but it still tastes great. hops are subdued but it's still a great beer."

""

"Pours a golden orange color with a very healthy white foam head. Smells of sweet citrus and a touch of oak. The oak aging comes through strongest in the flavor, which also has hints of citrus and sweet honey. Has a full body feel and goes down smooth. I enjoyed this, yet I found the combination of sweet citrus and dry oak a bit awkward, though interesting."
"Overall: A really good twist on a imperial IPA. The barrel adds some interesting notes without overwhelming the hops. A very good balanced blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass. Caramel-orange color with a slight off-white head that quickly retreats with virtually no lacing along the glass. Wow, this is one smooth hopped-up high ABV brew! The oak-aged properties are obviously in play with this beer. Yes, the alcohol content is 10% but hardly noticeable among the citrus, oak and spice aroma. The taste appeared to be citrus, pine, some spices, and something else; not quite sure. There was an almost thick-like mouth feel with a creamy finish on the palate. Personally, for me, as the beer rose in temperature I enjoyed it even more. Again, Dogfish Head has amazed me with their ability to concoct an amazing craft beer!"
""
""
" After lots of bourbon barrel aged beers this was a nice change, if I want a whiskey I will go and get a whiskey. Although it would be nice to try this beer in a bourbon barrel just to compare the two. . For 10% this beer is really easy drinking until I tried to leave the couch."

"Overall, a wonderfully tasty beer. It reminds me more of an English Barleywine at this point in it's life cycle than a Double IPA, but that is to be expected I suppose. The wood-aging has certainly turned this into a beer with a much longer acceptable drinking window. Now I must get my hands on a fresher bottle and see what the difference is like."
""
""
"Nose starts with a sweet malty presence with a definite oak aroma. Taste is definitely on the maltier side for an ipa but there is a noticeable citrus taste to compliment the caramel malt. As it warms the vanilla and oak flavors come through, but they are still subtle. This is a really great and unique beer. Instantly one of if not my favorite dogfish head beer. Its such a complex beer with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is a pleasure to drink. (93/100)"

"In conclusion, it tastes like it has aged but the aging didn't do much for this. I had high hopes as the label reads """ages with the best of them", but it fell short. I have a 2nd I have been saving, I'll probably open it sooner rather than later."

"What a great collaboration of an English Old Style & Imperial IPA! The appearance is a nice copper color with good head. The nose is full of wood, sherry, and vanilla notes with subtle hops. The Northwestern hops taste amazing blended with the oak wood richness. This beer is very thick in the mouth, if you slush it, the beerexpands and deepens in flavor. I am not an over the top fan of 60 & 90 minute IPA but love Burton Baton. Treat yourself to a snifter or 4 pack of this brew."

"Pours a dark amber nearly opaque with yeast sediment. Nice thick head with decent retention. Smells of darkfruits, citrus and orange peel. Moderate hop flavor for an IPA with more than average malt sweetness. Not cloying. Getting some spicy tannins from the oak barrel aging in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is better than average. Decently thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. A very good beer. The oak aging adds some interesting complexity."

"A dark honey/amber body, generous head, excellent retention sitting at a strong 3 fingers with drooping lacing all over. Aroma of strong wood, pine, all alcohol infused. Flavor is heavy on the pine, some sugar making it sweet but smooth. Drinks remarkably well despite the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 355 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 1-3-14."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle bottled 3 months ago. Smell: Citrus hops, burnt wood, malt. The booze smell becomes much more noticeable as the beer warms. Taste: Dried fruit and hops. The hop flavor doesn't over power the beer though. Allows you to keep searching for the other flavors. Very malty. A burnt woody flavor is there, but not a lot. Very smooth and the 10% is hidden well in my opinion. You could tell me 7-8 and id have no trouble believing it. Definitely up there on my favorites list. I first had it 3 years ago and I keep coming back"

"O - Very different from anything I've had before. I would say it drinks more like a barleywine than a DIPA. It's very malt-forward for an IPA but enjoyable. Although, this is definitely a sipper."

"Absolutely a delicious beer. High alcohol content does not overpower the flavors of hops and malts - but for me - mixes well compared to other 10%-ers. The beer pours a beautiful caramel color with a lightly tanned head, thick and puffy. A nice smell of malt that I found very appealing, with mouthfeel that was smooth and easy on the tongue. Overall, it was the best 10%-er I've had to date and would like very much to partake of more."

"O- One of the best oaked IIPA's I have ever had, in fact I'm upset that I'm just now getting to this beer. I will be back for more of this, if you want to venture into oak aged IPA's this would be an excellent gateway beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Amazingly complex and well balanced. Blending two batches of differently aged beers produced an extremely unique flavor and the oak aging makes for a smoothness that hides the high abv very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M-great well balanced great hops then the sweetness of the malts and oak. Excellence!"
""

"The appearance is a light amber with a touch of haze and a light tan head that doesn't stay on the glass. Carbonated perfectly. The aroma has an almost sour presence with citrus notes behind it and woody overtones. The taste starts with a strong Warrior hop punch right out of the gate, moving to an oaky bitterness in the middle when the malt depth and prune notes surface. It finishes citrusy with a bit of lingering, drawling mouth feel. You certainly get the English Ale yeast throughout the experience providing a somewhat sweet foundation to the taste. Surprisingly drinkable for a 10%er. Another nice """Big Beer""" from DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a big flavor and easy drinking oak-aged IPA. The oak doesn't overwhelm as it can in many others, but adds a nice subtle flavor. This big ABV beer hides it exceedingly well."

""

"O: just a great beer. The alcohol is definitely present but the oak gives it a wonderful complexity. /92"

"O - 4.25 - I like it. It's a solid beer. For the price? I'd probably spring for Third Coast Old Ale by Bell's first, or Double DBA if I had the money laying around and could find it. This one's an interesting take and it's interesting the way it's made."
""
""
""

"O: not one of my favorites from DFH. I think I prefer it fresh, but this wasn't kept in ideal conditions throughout its cellaring life so I would want to try a few more to be sure."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty deep copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has plenty of hops, a bit of pine to it. Taste starts off dry and very bitter, get smoother as the glass goes down. Some tropical fruits, pine, very dry. Alcohol is present throughout. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, a pretty good beer, but not as good as I expected."

"Overall I am not picking up much of the IPA elements, but it is still an excellent beer"

"Overall: There's a lot going on, and some of it works and some of it doesn't. The woodiness of the beer was well-executed because it wasn't overdone, but the hops struggled to make an impression. The alcohol was dangerously hidden. Overall, I'm glad I tried the beer, but I wouldn't spend the money to drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs, easily."
""
""
""
""
"O: The sweet and bitter flavors play well together adding complexity to this brew. Obviously crafted with great care, this is a good brew to sip with friends, not your everyday chugger. 8/10 would drink again."

"O - In a blind taste test, I could tell this was a DFH product, but so much better that 60/75/90/120 Minute IPA's. This is a beer to drink slowly and savor. I held off trying this beer since I am more of a West Coast IPA fan and also have been lukewarm on other DFH products, but this is a must try."

"Pours a nice dark amber. Resilient off-white head. Huge citrusy hop aroma. Taste has a great malt backbone. Tons of hops. Not overly bitter initially, but with a pleasant bitter aftertaste. Just a touch of burnt oak from the aged beer, although I'm not sure I would have noticed it if it wasn't in the description on the bottle. Nice full bodied mouthfeel. Boozy but it's not really noticeable. Dangerous. Overall, an absolutely great DIPA."
""
""
"Thanks to Kris for this one!"
"O - Quite good, but something I'd have to be in the mood for. I found myself wishing it was a little sweeter. The alcohol heat and bitterness from the wood makes it a slow sipper, taking it out of the """refreshing""" category. That said, it's very well done."
""
"Just had two bottles from 2007, one from March and the other from June. Pours dark brown/amber, smells of raisins and dates a touch of licorice. No head tastes like a sweet wine, always been one of my favorites, aged very well even though it aged much longer than I wanted. Really doesn't taste like an IPA, kinda like a sweet stout and barleywine concoction - very good!"
""
""
"Interesting to note is that the beer is a lot heavier than you'd think by looking at it. It's super sticky once it dries in the glass and is not something you can pound at all. I mean, that's true of a lot of IPAs, but Burton even more-so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A bottle poured into a pint glass revealed a nice colour with a decent head that dissipates after a bit, but leaves faint lacing along the edges of the glass. The smell has some of the fruity notes one would expect from an IPA, mixed with a great oaky smokiness. Really fantastic. The taste is similar- a great balance between a hoppy IPA and a barrel aged ale. Definitely one of my favourite beers out there."

"I can't get enough of this beer. Has a strong oak-aged flavor, but isn't overpowering. Easy to drink, and the hops are a great addition to the imperial oak-aged body. I really hope this isn't a beer that is going to go away or is only around seasonally. Cheers!"

"I'm one of those people who believe that you shouldn't barrel age Double/Imperial IPAs. The barrel aging takes away all of the beer's hoppy goodness and replaces it with boozy bourbon. This bottle had too much booze for me to buy again."

"Dogfish head has made a beer that is unique, flavorful, has depth and complexity. It drinks deliciously and they say it ages well too."
""
""
""
""
"O - A really good beer. I had it fresh a couple of years ago and seem to really liked more than I am liking it today, but again that was a year ago. I am missing the hop presence in it. I will have to get a fresh bottle now to compare."

"A super solid brew from DFH, it's one of my favorites now that I've discovered it... I can't wait to see where this one goes with some age. I will continue to purchase DFH four packs, not so much the bombers... Highly recommended."
"Atmosphere is great. Amber hue, nice bubbly head, and persistent lacing. Nose is a complex concoction of resiny hops, with sweet, fruit, and floral components. Hops, wood, and plant material. Hoppy, syrupy, liquory, and a little sweet. Overall, this is an excellent quaff."
"Poured this imperial IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The IIPA poured a orange amber color, produced an average white head, left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. above average retention. The aroma consisted of toasted malt and floral citrus fruit. Full bodied, smooth and creamy mouthfeel-There is a foundation of malted grain, herbal hop flavor, fresh fruit, citrus grapefruit and oak. Outstanding Imperial IPA another great offering from Dogfish Head"
""
""
"O - Overall, a delicious beer. Age has changed this in to something wonderful. Love it, wish I had more of it."
""
""
""
"From tasting notes: My sample aged for 9 months so I expected more of the hoppy Imperial IPA flavors to have diminished, but there was still plenty of that hop pop. This was a very hefty malty brew with enough hops to keep everyone honest. This opaque and syrupy concoction was akin to an American Barleywine. There were flavors of caramel malt and fruity undertones with a hop bitterness that was signature Dogfish Head."

"D - Definitely a DFH IPA. Similar hop character to both 60 and 90 minute. Excellent year round offering, but tough to find fresh, probably due to the price."
""
"D - The malt character of other Dogfish Head beers is quite recognizable here, and it integrates nicely with the oak and hop flavors. Appreciate the well-hidden alcohol and excellent mouthfeel. Curious on the freshness here, but liked it quite a bit all the same."

"A: Nice pencil thickness of head, reddish copper in color, miniscule signs of sediment – 4.00, S: Strong aromas of oak and citrusy hops are evident a couple of feet from the glass, quite a bit of candied pineapple and cherimoya – 4.00, T: Alcohol is upfront and evident and with a slight burn, some biscuity grains, hard sugar, lots of dark fruits and some hop bite, quite resiny and with a good dose of caramel – 4.25, M: Body is a touch thin to my palate though there is a nice silkiness – 3.75, D: Quite drinkable especially for a 10% beer – 4.00"

""

"Overall, this is the best of the four oak or barrel aged IPAs I have tried thus far. With that said, I am not a huge fan of this style. I would much rather drink a straight IPA any day."

"The Burton Baton is a nice DIPA. It was heavy on the sweet malt and abv which makes this a sipping beer an not a session ale. The beer poured a nice clear amber with thin white head that laced nicely. The scent was full of fresh hop that carried pine and citrus notes. The taste was very sweet and malty which helped to balance the bitter citrus hops. There was also a nice subtle back drop of pine. The mouthfeel was full body with subtle carbonation. Overall it was good...but one and done for me."

"Great flavorful beer! The malt comes out predominantly. Nice oak smell and after taste. Smells nutty. The high alcohol content. Fantastic hazelnut brown color brings out the malt characteristics. High alcohol content does hit you straight. I recommend."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep hazy amber with a two finger off-white head that dissipates to a delicate lacing. Aromas of bourbon, toffee, and sweet malt with some bitterness from the hops coming through. Sweetness from the malt hits the palate first then some IPA hop bitterness. Finishes smooth and sweet. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, another outstanding well crafted beer from Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Perhaps it's my penchant for big IPAs and Scotch Ales, but Burton Baton nearly surpassed my expectations. Oak-aging an IPA seems counterintuitive but the chosen hops definitely stand up to the challenge and mixing in a non-aged IPA recaptures all the fresh bitterness hop heads like myself crave. Good one DFH. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"very good, like most of the dogfish heads. bought a 4-pack at wegman's. drank it out of a snifter. medium brown color. the hoppiness came through. reminded me of the 90 minute IPA, but felt smoother, if that makes any sense. looking forward to trying the hellhound tonight"
"Not something I could have all the time, but it was a real treat to try this in midst of all the hype. The oak is not too refined, and I have a feeling this is best fresh rather than aged, but the earthy, floral flavors are pretty awesome overall, especially the vanilla/orange/tobacco combo that I previously mentioned. Indeed, it seems that aging hoppy, amber beers in oak bring out those aromas as opposed to the dark fruit/caramel flavor that the same process brings out in, say, stouts. Great stuff - definitely one of the most memorable beers I've had by these guys in midst of all the experimentation."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great. The barrel aging adds a nice layer of additional complexity. This would have been a great DIPA without it but its a very nice touch. Highly recommended"

"What a wonderful rich but not overbearing sipper. I was given a four pack by a friend for sitting by the fire. Very generous but not the right choice for the venue. Over a few days, it was my last beer of the night, but I insisted on keeping the last for savoring in a snifter. Wow."
""
""
""
"O - I don't know, maybe this is too good to be true, I love this beer. I desire it more than just a Regular Imperial IPA because of the many different flavors that this beer has. Very well balanced. Highly Recommended ! Cheers !!"

"O: this fusion of styles is cleverly obtained by blending two beers instead of sacrificing qualities of one or the other, an intriguing version of a style that sets itself apart from others, barrel aging a DIPA sounds like a bad idea but DFH found a way to make it work well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall, this is by far one of my favorites Imperial IPA. It has a nice rich and complex taste blended very well. For a 10% ABV, this is a very smooth beer. Each sip I discover different tastes, and its very, very smooth. I still can't believe its a 10%. IF you see this, BUY IT & TRY IT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o. Really top quality all the way, So good I'd rather sip it in an easy chair all alone than use it as a refresher/session ale, but then at 10% ABV sessioning wouldn't last long with me. Definitely worth the extra cost for its added dimensions over most other IPAs."

"I poured this beer from a 12oz bottle in to my Sam Adams perfect pint glass.It was a beautiful amber in color with a thick white head that hung around all the way down the glass. IT had a wonderful aroma, smells of fruit and malt. For a 10%er, this is tame and goes a bit too smooth for a high alcohol beer. Malty flavor comes out first with some vanilla, and a hop bite, the oak really tones this beer down. This was one of the best beers I've had. Great job by Dogfish!!"

"Overall: I loved this IPA from Dogfish, as it is yet another strong effort from them. I can't wait to get my hands on another 4-pack of this stuff, definitely try it if you can!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Where can I start with this beer? Well, it was definitely not what I expected. When I saw that this was an Imperial IPA, I was expecting a higher hop smell/taste to it. But I can only assume that the oak affected this. (just an assumption) But I have to be honest, the more I drank it, the more I enjoyed it. After I got over the fact that it wasn’t as hoppy as expected, I actually really enjoyed this. Another plus to this beer was that it left a good aftertaste in my mouth. It left me wanting more."

"O: Not my favorite thing in the world. But... It's not the worst either. If you like 90min or 120min, then give this beer a shot. If you don't care for those beers, then skip this one. I don't see myself buying this again anytime soon."
"Low B-"
"Overall: probably my favorite dogfish head, this is one of the better oak aged beers I've had. Alcohol is pleasantly disguised and the complexity of the flavors Is almost mind blowing. Not your typical dip, do not pass this over."
"Overall: Excellent balance of sweet, tart, and bitter with delicious complexity from the oak aging. One of my absolute favorite beers."

"Smooth maltiness in the body, the taste is sweet and dry. Very little complexity or taste outside of malts, I got no taste from the barrel. Despite the lack of diversity it is still a very tasty ale with high ABV and no hint of alcohol on the tongue."

"This beer is comparable to the 120 minute IPA in terms of taste and complexity. In my opinion, this is their best year-round brew. Sits between the 90 minute and 120 minute, and for the value is fantastic. Potent, sweet, and hoppy, this may be the perfect balance, especially for those who think the 90 minute is too hoppy, and the 120 minute too sweet."

"Mouth feel is medium to slightly full Slight resin and oily feel. Moderate carbonation. Boozy and high ABV beer. I like the boldness. Borders very heavily towards being a Barleywine ale and in a blind taste I will certainly rate it as one."

"I bought this beer with a slew of other IPAs, including some other Dogfish Head brews. I didn't know what to expect from it, as I hadn't read up on it. Yet, my taste buds were blown away after the first sip. There are so many flavors in this one and you can taste each of the beer styles that comprise its legacy. The smooth toffee flavors of the English Ale rest well alongside the floral notes of the IPA. The mouthfeel is smooth, almost silky, with a semi-sweet after taste that lingers ever so slightly. This beer is incredible, showing respect to the styles that give it its context and balancing them well. If you like imperial ales or IPAs, try this. This beer is beautiful."

"It hides the booziness perfectly. It reminds me almost of a Stone Oaked Bastard or Double Bastard."
""
""
"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into tulip. Pours dark orange with a thick white head that sticks around. Smells sweet and mellow, yet hoppy and floral at the same time. Like sweet citrus fruit blended with the spicier hop aroma. Taste is like the regular 90 minute, but mellowed out; sweetness predominates up front sliding cleanly into a tastefully bitter hop finish. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, which is surprising for 10%. Mouthfeel is smooth and relatively full. Overall a great beer; perfect for IPA lovers who also want a more mellow complex sipping beer."
"overall- this is my favorite dogfish head brew to date, a well made dipa with very good balance between the vanilla oak and hop bitterness with a good transition. if youre a fan of dipa's this is definetly a great spin on your average imperial, highly recommend1"

"I'd liken this to a softer, toned down Double Bastard or maybe a drier, hoppier 90 Minute (though admittedly, I've not had it in a while). While somewhat pricey, it's definitely worth a try. One of DFH's best offerings."
""
"O- Awesome! This is the double IPA I'm always looking for. It's a hop bomb that doesn't over stay it's welcome. I'd buy this any day. Fantastic beer by my standard."

""
""
""
""

"O: Dogfish Head is by far my favorite brewery in existence. I really wish I had gotten this beer sooner, it's not my favorite brew they make, but it is definitely enjoyable, and I plan on aging a few bottles in the cellar."
""
""
"o: As mentioned, this was not my favorite beer as the flavors are too unique for me however I still rated this high as they did balance each other out extremely well. So, not poorly made, just not made for me. Someone that likes intense flavor with spice and light fruits - would love this beer."

"a masterful concoction, it has flavor, substance and kick. I remember trying this when it was first made years ago... boy have they really honed this recipe."
""
"Overall I love the beer, which is why the overall score is above the average of the four primary characteristics. I enjoy strong beer with balance and flavor and this beer has it. If you like hoppy, strong beers then I think you will enjoy this beer. If you are looking to expand your beer horizons and want to try a brew with real strength and character then you should try Burton Baton."

"O:Might have found another favorite. I see this beer pairing well with a campfire. Really smooth pronounced full bodied front, with a medium yet firm bitter leading to a real warmer for a nice ending. They should have called it Horny Cougar. This one shows experience, nice job again Dogfish Head!"
""

"Overall/Comments: Very complex with a unique flavor. This was an excellent brew and a must try. Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA @ 10% ABV. Consumed 1-27-13."
"This was one of the more bizarre IPA's I've ever had. It's a mixture a double IPA with English old ale. The IPA aspects are wonderfully hoppy and the wooden qualities imparted by the old ale are so brilliant that I'm surprised it hasn't been tried in any other beers (that I know of). Very very nice carbonation, intense but not annoyingly so. The sweetness of this beer is very vanilla rather than hoppy, but as the beer warms the hoppiness begins to dominate more. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is VERY dangerously drinkable for a 10% beer. This is the kind of DIPA concoction that could really please almost every craft beer enthusiast. I'm not surprised many people have mistaken this beer for a barleywine, because it may as well be one. IT shares so many of the characteristics displayed by a hoppier version of an american barleywine. It just needs a bit more barley. Overall this is a fantastic beer. Ended up giving a few bottles to friends as presents since DFH is hard to come by up here, and they seemed very happy."

"At first sip, it tastes overly sweet but some of that is the citrus hitting your palate. After a few minutes, you begin to taste the subtle bitterness, savory notes of hops and an effervescent -- almost hefeweizen -- spring wheat. Very refreshing, light and tasty. Best enjoyed in a snifter, at the end of a long-day."

"O - Takes like a stronger, oaked Ballentine XXX (which I had and liked while a late teenager in NJ). One of the best Dogfish Head beers I've had. Had this side-by-side on 2013-05-28 with a He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A. and preferred the Lenny's but this is close. Will seek this out again."

"Don't expect a hop bomb out of this. You shouldn't - it's a barrel-aged DIPA. This is more like a spicy and sweet barleywine with lots of hop flavor (but not necessarily bitterness). Overall, just a bit on the fruity side, and the alcohol was apparent, though I guess it starts to get hard to mask at 10% ABV. Much better than I was expecting, being my first intentionally """aged""" IPA. I'll have to try and seek out more of this type to compare."
"0- Very mellow and drinkable, for 10% abv. I'll definitely keep one of these in the beer fridge; not cheap, but can be picked up as a single and worth doing so."

"This is one velvet hammer of a beer. Huge head of off slightly off white creaminess. Lightly clouded roasted pumpkin colored fluid that shows little carbonation. Quite a bit of lace. Smell is one tick short of sublime. Deep, rich, velvety malt shows caramel and whole grain biscuit. Just a trace of alcohol sweetness and mild citrusy hops. Vanilla and oak caress the back of my nose. Taste is a willing accomplice.Toasty caramel malt with oak and vanilla caressing the tongue with a minty herbal hops in the finish. lovely velvet tongue. Mild carbonation with a drinkable persona. Goes down way too easy in fact. A superb oaked DIPA that leans toward drinkability instead of tongue scraping bitterness."

"Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but the oak flavors and high hops bitterness is a little off-putting. This is more of a beer for IPA lovers. I gave it a chance, and it's not bad, but it's also not my cup of tea...or beer."
""
""
""
""
"Aging this with oak staves really mellows this out and makes for exceptional drinkability. I forgot how good this stuff is. One of Dogfish’s best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, quite good. The aroma is great but I don't find the taste to quite live up to it. Oak is a bit much in the taste but nicely blended in the nose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark copper with a two finger head, nice lacing . Nice nose; oaky, dark fruit, hops obviously, apricots. Taste is very balanced, the oak doesn't overpower the hops or vise versa. Nice dark fruit flavors. Over all I like this one a lot, a great oak aged ale that finds the perfect balance between hops and oak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: Just tried a bottle of 1 year and 7 months in age (9/29/12 bottle date)..so far this is the best age yet. Creamy low head throughout, and the hops blend perfectly with this, smoothed out to perfection. I wouldn't go past 2 years with this."
"I may be being dramatic, but this blend of American beers (which have been 'pickled' If you will, in an oak barrel) may be the best American style beer I've had. Right away, after you open and taste, you get sweetness, and then bold strong ale that comes after. Not harsh, but smooth and subtle like good whiskey. I'm not one for imaginative fruits and spices, what I taste is craftsmanship. But there is a syrup/molasses scent emitting from my glass. A very rich, enjoyable aroma. I don't think there is another American style brew that can top this off. If you come across Burton Baton, buy it. IT'S Very, very, good."
""
""
"O - Not bad, but not outrageous. The flavor profile falls a little flat about mid way through the profile, and it could use just a shade more carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best beers I've had in the past year. An absolute beauty. It smells of wood and hops simultaneously. Beautiful amber color, and a smooth but hoppy taste. Mellow and exilirating at the same time, there is no way this is 10% abv! But it is. Oh, it is. My favorite Dogfish beer by far. A masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""

"Some caramel/butterscotch/toffee surfaces on the tongue, bold hop flavors take a back seat to these dessert notes and vanilla/oak. Lovely stuff. This is such an underbrewed style of beer... would love to see more breweries take a swing at this. DFH was one of the first, and they nailed it pretty early on."
"This a decent beer, nothing great or wowing, but worthy of a try, especially on a cold/rainy winter day."

"O: This is all right. I had some higher hopes for this beer. I wouldn't refuse another if offered. I've got one more bottle I'm going to sit on for awhile to see what happens to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure if it was the booze being too forward, or the balance of this beer just being off but it's a bit hard for me to drink, I poured the few remaining ounces down the drain. I like my big beers too, I was sippin' BT and White Chocolate last night but this one didn't rub me the right way. But maybe this brew will be so much better in a year with some time to mellow out, right now it's a hot mess."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer, but doesn't have the hop character I would generally expect from an imperial IPA. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though - the oak, sweetness, and hints of alcoholic warmth fill out the beer very nicely."
""
"O: The biggest takeaway for me is that while dark fruit flavors were present, they were also welcome. I usually hate dark fruit, but this did not have the raisin puree flavor I typically find in beers with dark fruit characters. That being said, taste was still not mind blowing. I wanted more hops. I am currently wishing I had opened this beer a couple months ago when I bought it. I also would have likely for more barrel characters to show up, but I am splitting hairs. This was a surprisingly good beer for me."
""
"I really wish this one sat on wood a good while longer, and at least another hop addition would have done is justice. Last word: very good, but.... well, give one to your non-beer-geek friends to get them on the path to great beers."
""
""
""
""
"O - nice brew. The barrel element added a nice piece of complexity. Managed to blend the hops, malt and barrel very well. Each element is complex on its own, but doesn't fight the others. I think maybe this would have been a tad better at 8% ABV rather than 10%, as its pretty hot. But, I will certainly track this down again."
"This took me by surprise. If not for all the alcohol flavor I would kick the taste to a 4. A great beer for sure and the beer dude at the store said it is now year round which is cool. An aged bottle would be interesting to try."

"Overall: This beer can do anything that you'd like it too, really. When it's fresh, it's REALLY hoppy, but the oak and malt keeps it somewhat in check, though it still leans towards the hoppy side. Age this for a year+ and the vanilla/caramel sweetness will really show itself, while the hops recede. A favorite beer of mine, in any state that I can drink it. Did I mention that this is now a year rounder?"

"Loved this beer. Funky orange/bronzy/golden color, tan colored and pretty compact head. Sweet smelling, oily and resinous, definite citrus, some flowery notes. Nice kick from the alcohol - warming but not overwhelming. Earthy/woodsy with some citrus flavors, pine resin, maybe a trace of vanilla lurking. Some funky fruitiness going on - can't quite identify. Big bitter finish that is not unpleasant, I figure this would go very well with spicy foods - naybe not an every day drinker without food to accompany."

"O: This is a great beer. It has great balance, is easy to drink, and hides the alcohol very well. Another winner from Dogfish Head."

"Overall, I used to like this beer a lot more than I do now. I love wood-aged beers but like so many other Dogfish Head brews, this one seems under attenuated and is quite sweet. It becomes a chore to drink after awhile."
""
"I was a little hesitant to try this beer, although Dogfish Head has never disappointed. Beautiful in color, a mouth-watering smell, and punch to the taste buds, Burton Baton at 10% is extremely flavorful, especially when you get a taste of the oak at the back end. I would definitely put it up there with the 60 Minute."
""
"This is a solid beer. The smell kinda had a """damn, I don't know about this one""" quality. Once I tasted though...love. It was a heavy beer. I could taste the IPA, the oakiness (if that's even a word), maybe some citrus in it too. The alcohol can definitely kick you in the ass though. A few of these and I would be more of a drooling idiot than I am now. All in all: I like it! Buy it, trade for it, whatever. It's worth it."

"This is the second time I tried this and it's been about four years since the last time... This time was not good at all. It claims to be an oak aged imperial ipa but the whole flavor is malty alcohol. Perhaps the oak is overpowering the hops but either way it's not what I would want out if something called an imperial IPA. Not many dog fish head that I don't care for but I wouldn't want this one again."
""
""
"O: This is a really outstanding beer. Like many DFH beers, this one was difficult to classify as any particular style. It is just a good, robustly flavorful beer. As far as style, it seemed to fall somewhere in between a barleywine and a milder DIPA. This beer is definitely worth a try just to experience the robustness of the bready yeast, the malt sweetness, and the graininess. These flavors came together with the just enough hops bitterness to create and explosion of flavors that worked well together."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer smells big and grapefruity with pleasant undertones of sweet caramely malts and a cloying alcohol burn sitting below that. The sweetness is a little off-putting but the grapefruit hints are deliciously enticing. The beer tastes wonderfully bitter with an even better malty balancing that leaves this beer kissing my taste buds, with light spicy burning alcohol coming from the high ABV. The beer begins with bitter biting grapefruit and then opens briefly into sweet cloying malt and alcohol, before closing into a superb mixture of malty caramel and bitter grapefruit with light spicy notes from the bread and slight biscuity malts also coming through. This beer is superb, and gives me hope for barrel aged IPA’s. The finish is to die for, and the functions of both the imperial IPA and the English-style old ale. Mouthfeel is mellow and chewy, with lovely jelling feels on the tongue. It leaves the mouth dry with a slight linger of cloying malts and alcohol that’s wonderfully dampened by the bitters from the grapefruit hops. Overall this is a great off centered ale from Dogfish Head, and a superb balancing job. I’m very glad that barrel aged IPA’s work. I’ve heard that there are some great ones out there, and I’ve had some mediocre ones myself that dim the hops far too much, so I’m very happy to have seen one work. Try this beer."

"Thin cap never completly goes away. The nose is similar to fresh. The booziness seems to have faded. Taste is great it all just comes together after a year. Oaky, malty, still slightly bitter. I am pleasantly surprized, I am a Huge Fan Aged!"

"One of the more enjoyable DFH beers in my opinion..Gonna save one for a later date"
""
""
"Whatever it may be classified, it is certainly unique and very, very tasty. This baby is good for sipping as an after dinner treat. The only """problem""" is that it is not boozy at all considering the high ABV and the 10% will sneak up quickly if one enjoys it too much."
""
"Appearance is sweet - golden, amber, hazy, nice """walls""" of head remain on the outside of the glass. Smell is bitter sweet - maybe a candy or molasses coming through. Taste is like a very strong British bitter - hops are present but well balanced with the extra malt flavor. Like drinking 2 beers at the same time - I go back and forth between the more typical British ESB flavor and then back to caramel and hops. When you see the layers this is a sweet beer but makes you work to find all of these flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm usually an IPA purist, but this is one cool beer. After finding out that this is a mix of two different styled beers that are then oaked together is impressive. It is hoppy like an IPA, but smooth like an oaked ale. It is truly like a 50/50 mix of the two giving it perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crazy hiss when opened...pours a hazy burnt orange with thick foamy head. Huge piney sharp hop aromas and a bit of oak/cedar. Really great oak/wood/cedar hop flavors with a very mellow hop (im really thinking the aging mellowed the hop out). Slight citrus and red ale type flavor. I really like the IPA nose but the citrus-like malty strong ale flavor. Easy drinker especially for the abv and a great DIPA...maybe along th elines of a Triple IPA."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Strong Ale, it had just enough Old Ale aspects as it had DIPA aspects, it blurred the line between the two and it was what it intended to be. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth for how strong it was, but the sweetness and warming alcohol would prevent me from wanting another, one is just enough, it's a sipper. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the complexity in both the aroma and the taste, they were both nice. What I liked least about this beer was that the sweetness got a little out of hand and I would like to have more barrel flavors and aromas in this beer. I might buy this beer again for a special occasion, but at $3.89 a bottle it's pretty expensive and there are many other beers that taste similar for a better price, so I don't think I'll be buying this again anytime soon, but I recommend giving it a try especially if you are into the higher octane stuff. All in all I have to say that Dogfish Head delivered just what I thought they would, another strong and complex beer that's a good once in awhile beer, I enjoyed it and I'm really interested in the idea of blending beers and would like to see some more brewery's experiment with this, good job guys, this is a good beer to sip on."
"O: I don't buy this often because of the price (~$15/4 pack), but every time I think I should buy this more often. This is a great change of pace for a sipping beer if you are getting tired of only having a RIS."

"O: fantastic beer. Labeled as a double ipa, this drinks more like a pale ale blended with a barley wine. A fine brew to sip on and savor. Perhaps a little too sweet for the style, but beer is art and interpretation is independent."
"D - A very nice beer... A quality sipper... Provides a nice warming feeling... Not something I would necessarily buy a case of, but something that I would gladly drink again when the opportunity presents itself... A very nice way to finish a day..."
"Just another win for dogfish in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love strong beers and I love both Old Ales and Double IPAs. Something just doesn't feel right to me here. Alcohol and some roast note seem to take a stand and throw off what allured to me in the aroma. Not terrible by any means but the balance of flavor is off to me and it just doesn't work out. It seems like everything is over the top somehow. Maybe with some age?"
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, an amazing """sipping-beer""". This beer was obviously not made for chugging, gulping, or doing keg-stands on. It is extremely complex and multi-dimensional and worth taking the time to analyze it. I plan on sharing a bottle of it with a friend."

"If you're going to blend, you should at least make sure that the harmony stays intact, but this marriage between the nose and body is sadly a rocky affair."

"O - The finish on this beer is one of the most balanced and well crafted beers I have ever had. The taste was not lived up to the anomalous combination of appearance and smell. This beer is the total package and it kept getting better through the experience. On the hoof, this might be the most impressive beer I have ever enjoyed. It is that good. I'm so happy that DFH is FINALLY distributing to the Grand Rapids area."

"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a beautiful dark orange color with a nice fine white head. Aroma of sweet malt and pine and citrus hops. Flavor is bready malt, dark fruit and pine hops right up front, a malty hoppy middle and pine and citrus hop finish. Resembles a hopped up American barley wine. Moderate to heavy body with good mouth feel. High ABV, but complex enough to be great as a single glass. Begs to be aged. I will comply."
"taste: A little sweet for my liking but great none the less. good balance of piny citrus resin hops you would come to expect from a dogfish head ipa. But with a sweet bready malt that ties it together well, again the Malt overpowers at first but then evenly balances out with citrus/pine resin."
"O- I don't recall ever having a Wood-aged Imperial IPA, but I must say I really enjoyed it. I've come to realized that Dogfish Head's IPAs are usually exceptional. Grab a 4 pack, you'll be glad you did."
""
""
"Six of us attending a beer tasting that I hosted in my man cave pub gave this beer a score of 23 out of a possible 30 for and an average score of about 4. It ranked 4th out of the 12 beers we tasted. The group of six were divided evenly, 3 that favored IPA's and 3 that favored Stouts. Comes in 4 pack and can be found in most well stocked micro-brew stores."

"O - Burton Baton is one of my favorites. The overall experience is fantastic, the blend they use really melds the hoppiness nicely with the oak and vanilla notes from the wood aging. A great beer, I will gladly have this one again and again."
""
"M: What a smooth beer! Full bodied. Excellent. I also don't get a lot of booziness in the mouth for a 10% beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: It is what it says. It's a blend and you can tell. Big characteristics from both base beers, but it loses a little something overall. Nice depth of flavor, but it falls apart in the long run. A bit more harmony of flavor would be a good thing."
""
"This is what an IPA should be. It's heavily hopped, and sufficiently bitter, but doesn't allow the hops to be the singular focus of the recipe... allowing it to develop and become a multidimensional brew. It seems (to me) that a lot of today's IPAs participate in a hops-arms-race... focused on maxing out their IBUs and blowing you away with piney citrusy hops. Other dogfish head ales are no exception. And that's all great sometimes. But for this beer the brewers were able to take a step back, find all the crucial, fundamental elements of what makes those two-dimensional IPAs so appealing, and add plenty of depth and complexity. You'll love it."
"O: If I was stuck on a desert isle with my choice of one beer for the rest of my life, this would definitely be a serious contender. Magnifique."

"Very smoothe, very well crafted. DFH has done us all a service here by producing this particular brew. Find some, and drink it. You'll be glad you did. I'm gonna grab a pack and age them."
"O - An enjoyable and flavorful double IPA. The wood and oak flavors really come through and add character. I would have preferred just a little more bitterness from the hops."
"O: A bit of an odd beer, quite bitter and hoppy, yet this beer has a strong malt backbone. It's hoppy, it's oaky, it's sweet, and it's bready. I enjoyed this beer, but it's more of an American Barleywine to me than it is a DIPA. I would recommend it if you're looking for an oaky mixture of the two."
""

"O - A fantastic hybrid IPA for Dogfish Head that I would love to have on a regular occasion. The ABV is well masked and without proper pacing, this one would sentence you to the floor rather quickly."

"The fact that this is available year round is its greatest feature. Oaked IPAs can tend to go overboard, but this one has the perfect subtelty of vanilla oak in both aroma and flavor. Serious warming alcohol going on, but not overpowering. Color is a beautiful copper with a creamy head. Neat beer here. Revisited this a few times and batches seem to vary. Sometimes a big candy sweet bomb (less thrilled with that), but when super fresh some batches are huge hop bombs. Downgraded a bit for the variety but still enjoy this one. My opinion is that this is best enjoyed after a month or two. The flavors seem to blend more seemlessly when the hops aren't overbearing and it hasn't yet turned into an overly syrupy barleywine."

"O - The best wood aged IPA I've ever had. This is just another amazing beer by Dogfish Head. It only gets better with age as well!"
"Overall, this is a fabulously well-crafted beer. I am not a big fan of oak-aged IPAs. I just don't think oak-aging suits the flavor of an IPA very well. Nevertheless, I tried this beer at ``Friday Night Flights'' at Party Town in Florence, KY (yeah, I love ya Party Town!) and knew it was one I wanted to try at home. The fact that I enjoyed a beer that I ordinarily would not should tell you it's good. Fans of IIPAs, Old Ales, barrel-aged beers, and interesting interpretations of styles should seek this out. It's terrific."
""
"While this is certainly interesting, I can't say I find it particularly charming. It's like Dogfish Head managed to combine my least favorite aspects of 90 Minute IPA and the old ale style. I don't really enjoy the hop profile or the malt profile. But despite these comments, this is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I always love Dogfish head beers. It's one of my favorite breweries, and I look forward to this beer each year. Soon when I can afford to get a beer/wine cellar I need to buy this and bottle age it, for sure."

"Because Burton Baton is classified as a double IPA, I assumed that I should drink my bottle fresh. However, I later discovered that this beer has more similarities to a hoppy barleywine than an IPA and thus might benefit from some aging. Given some time, this could be a real winner."
"Overall very Well done !"
""
"Nearly full body with a lighter-than-expected carbonation. Smooth as the style can really get and with a drying finish. I was really looking forward to this one as I'm really liking the 2X IPAs and have always liked DFH brews. This one is a bit of a disappointment for me on both points."
"Extremely recommended! This is one amazing Imperial IPA!"

"Bottled on March 27, 2012. Weathered copper orange in color with a deep chill haze that partially clarifies as this warms. Poured with a rich, rocky off-white foam that slowly reduces to a thick cap that leaves huge sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Resinous citrus hop aromas are prevalent with a musty earthiness and intensely sweet maltiness. Creamy smooth feel with soft, delicate carbonation. Earthy, musty flavor up front that gives way to a quickly emerging citrus hop flavor into the middle. Citrus and sweet malt flavors through the middle toward the end hat transition to a mellow, musty, vanilla flavor right before the finish . Finishes with a bitter pine hop bite that ushers in a final earthy, musty flavor before a piney hop and slightly boozy finale. Fabulous feel and flavor complexity."

"Bottle reads """Bottled In: 2012 I 16:29""" poured to pint glass the beer arrives a perfectly translucent golden amber color with a nice 1.5 finger white head, good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is hoppy and sweet with tones of oak and alcohol warmth, caramel sweetness, and earthy citrus hops. The flavor is fantastic. The oak is not too dominant as is found so often with oak aged IPAs, it blends very well with the medium bitterness, caramel sweetness, and earthy citrus hop flavors. Very nice. Well crafted and enjoyable. The flavor seems to linger forever. Nice and oaky. Smooth and crisp no hint of the alcohol as detected in the nose. Well carbonated. Overall, this is a treat. Highly recommended!"
""
""
"Overall, it's overly sugary sweet and alcoholic with no real hop flavor."
""
""
"O: DON'T DRINK THIS COLD! I made that mistake yesterday, and it turned out to be very underwhelming. At room temperature, it comes out of its shell as an impressive, if slightly mellow, oak-aged barleywine (let's face it, that's exactly what this is!) Even at $15 a 4 pack, I'd totally get this one again."

"Yes, this was a strong beer and feels like one. The alcohol is prevalent ere and could be easily detected by the time the bottle was downed. That being said, it didn't detract from the taste and the resin character of the beer, tied everything in together well. Yes, this had the hoppy characteristic of a DIPA but the manner in which this beer was brewed makes it stand out from its West Coast counterparts. I paid enough for this single bottle but it had Dogfish Head on the label, as a reassurance. Sure enough, that was all I needed to see, as once again, these guys proved why they're the best as producing hoppy beers that stand above the pack. Highly recommended."

"O: Interesting beer, kinda like a highly hopped barley wine, a little age would be interesting to see if it can smooth it out, though I enjoyed the fresh hop aromas and initial kick. Its actually pretty well balanced, and a smooth sipper. As it warmed got far less hop based, and oak/bourbon flavors came through more. I'd recommend trying this at any age."
"O- Although the oak is not normal for an American D-IPA, it adds something fun. It does, however, cause it not to have the taste characteristics I look for in a D-IPA. Not enough citrus in the taste. I feel obliged to take off points from the taste for the things it is missing for this style. It really needs a style category of its own. It is not sessionable because you can really only drink one or two in a day without getting hammered. It is a terrific brew worthy of sharing with only the most special guest. It is a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. It wont make my """best double ipa""" list because it is not true to the style, but it makes my """top 5 beers ever""" list hands down. Very well done and worth the price and the wait. Another great Dogfish offering."

"From a bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a copper amber with a inch thick off white head with nice sticky lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, orange, lemon, caramel, and light oak. Taste is pineapple, apricot, toasted oak, grapefruit, caramel, and some bready malts. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit sticky. This beer is complex and awesome."
""
""
""
""
"This beer may not fit the elite stature for most people, but the more I drink of this beer the more I love it. The old ale blended with the IPA and aged in oak for a month is just perfect. I just had this after a Sierra Nevada Hoptimum(which I love) and the smoothness of Burton just kills it. All week I've had different beers and the oak and old ale/IPA just keep bringing me back to it. Easily my favorite DogFishHead to date and along w. Captain Lawrence Captains Reserve my favorite (relatively easy to get) east coast IPA's. Don't care who disagrees this is a great f'n beer. 95 or higher in my book."

""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent brew, smooth, nice aroma and flavor, complex with a good balance"
""
"Pours an hazy golden amber with orange hues and a one finger fluffy white head. A considerable amount of lacing is present. The aroma is floral, accented by fruitiness, and biscuity notes. The taste is tangy ripe fruit, bitter citrus rind and pine tempered by smooth oakiness. Extremely creamy and velvety smooth mouthfeel. A wonderfully unique brew that is so smooth that it's easy to forget about the 10% abv."

"Overall - first ever straight 4.5's! An excellent DIPA and will seek out again and again !"

"Overall: For the genre you cant get a more drinkable beer. This one actually probably deserves a higher than 5 in that category."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer that could very easily sneak up on you with the high ABV that is very well hidden. I certainly get much more of the IPA than the old ale but the barrel aging definitely is noticeable. One of the better regular year round offerings from Dogfish Head. I will likely get another one of these at some point in the future."
""

"Overall: Excellent, but a bit more malt would be excellent, perhaps some crystal malt or some 4 row"

"i don't know why i never picked this up before, probably the $13 six pack tag, but i finally went through with it and it feels like it was worth it."

"Update: Burton Baton still ranks as one of (if not) the best DIPA's ever. I have now been enjoying it over two years and it is as consistent now as the first time I ever sampled it. However, I would caution those with fresh bottles to be conservative with your pour as to leave as much yeast in the bottle as possible. You will be awarded with a beer that is clearer, more hoppy and less 'bready' than if you decant the entire lot into your glass...last batch bottled-on date: 10/23/13"

"O- 90 minute on steroids. Really oaky, malty steroids. A must try."
"O: This is amazingly delicious, and so easily drinkable, despite the hefty ABV it goes down super-easy because it's such a nice mix of sweet and bitter."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a brandy snifter. Pours a clear amber chestnut with highlights of orange. A thin laced tight bubbled ring forms around the glass, decent legs and sticky slime. Piny citrus hops burst through with a full alcohol plum, big caramel malt follows with a sublte earthy wood, big vanilla and alcohol on the finish , so intersting. Smooth grapefruit flavor without the bitter excellent malt backing, big juicy fruit taste can't get enough. The oak really shines on the taste and gives it such a mellow fresh tasting candy like feel, no booze to be found. Big on feel an body, extremely smooth and mellow for such a big beer. Overall this is a real treat. Fantastic malt an oak profile buttery smooth feel. Not a hop lovers delight however because of the aging process. Just a totally different take at a DIPA and ridiculously delicious."
"O: If you want the delicious balance between oak and hops, drink fresh. Aged is still good, but don't expect the normal burton baton you are used to; it is a very different experience. Maybe age one for each 4 pack you get."

"Orange color with a creamy head that holds almost all the way through the glass. aroma is sweet and malty, hops are mixed in with some fruity and caramel aromas. flavor is very mellow. The sweet caramel malts are actually the dominiant part of the flavor, with the fruit tones and some smoke/oak flavors."
"Overall – Alright, but would likely not do again as its not really worth its price. It had a nice nose and some nice flavors, but the alcohol taste at the end and the not quite right mouthfeel would likely prevent me from having this beer again"
""
""
""

"O: Overall I like this beer. Not sure if it 100% falls into the imperial IPA category but I do like everything about it."
"The really nice thing is that this is easy to get and commonly available. A great, approachable flagship beer. I love their experimental and braveness, but their everyday brew really hits the solid spot."

"Consumed from a Dogfish Head snifter, this is the easiest-drinking IIPA that I have ever had. Given how well it warms, one can pair it with conversation as well as spicy food."

"This was an absolutely enjoyable beer with a level of complexity that is often rare to find in most Imperial IPA’s I’ve had so far. I did happen to have this beer prior to It becoming a year-round offering in DFH’s catalog, and it was very similar to this cellared versions except the alcohol warmth was more noticeable and the vanilla notes were not as defined. I may try to cellar the rear-round version to see if I could get similar results."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Great feel. Viscous with the carbonation cutting it nicely. Light boozy warmth in the finish."
""
"Pours a clear amber with a solid 2 fingers of head. Disapates quickly. The smell is what hits you right off. It is unreal. Citrus, flowery, oak, woody, hops. All smashes you right in the face following the pour. Taste is much of the same. Roasty malt, oak comes in late. Nicely carbonated, definitely feels like an IIPA. Heavy, but smooth and easy to drink. Really nice result of a great idea to age an IPA. Love DFH."
""
""
""
"Overall - A Very good beer, as i said before this is a game changer, it really is unlike anything I've had before in the vast amounts of styles I've tried, i really enjoy this beer fresh or old and can't wait to see what this one does in a few years."
""

"O: This is an exceptionally unique IPA. I think this is definitely one of the beers that made me seriously consider what craft beer can do other than be quirky and trendy. It can be seriously extreme and amazingly unique."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured about half the bottle into a pint glass. i would prefer to use a snifer, but Im too lazy to do the dishes. Pours darker tan with no haziness. Carbonation is fair, and bubbles are dense and tight to suggest a fairly nice body. Smells of hops and grapefruit come first followed by a woody oaky smell. Taste is fairly similar. Crisp hoppy flavor hits first, then follows with sweet honey and grapefruit. Finishes off with oak and some residual hop flavor. Enjoyed this beer alot. Had a very dogfish head style taste that remindes me of 90 minute ipa. Could have a little smoother finish, also fell it was a little too sweet for my taste. But not the less another great dogfish head ale."
""
"O - I had mixed feeling about oak aged DIPAS, and still do to be honest. This is fantastic, much better than oak aged unearthly imo. DFH I used to this was overrated. My mine has been changed not only by this beer, but 120 min and WWS. Keep doing what you guys do!"
""
"Dry, long finish, full body, and rich. I find this one not so easy to drink. It takes some care and ease, and is best shared. When you slow down, this has many interesting characteristics. I have had this numerous times and enjoy it like new each time. "
""
""
"This is the mouthfeel of dreams for the style! Thick, dense, and chewy with an immense creaminess. Great sparkling feel on the tongue added with the spiciness. Lovely bitter finish with the warming effects of alcohol. Impeccable. Wish all IIPAs drank like this one."
"O: A tasty, sweet, complex IPA that is well worth the experience. This beer will definitely give you a little to think about."
""
""
"Overall- Not my favorite DFH beer. Lets be honest though, even the worst of Sam's beers could blow most other beers out of the water. Age it for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really great beer! A very interesting DIPA, blended with Old Ale if I recall. Presumably it's the oak aging that cuts the hop bitterness and results in such a smooth, robust beer."
""
"O - This beer is phenomenal. The oak works perfectly to give it a dry finish and I think the hops are more pronounced than in 90 minute. Extremely balanced. I first had it at the pub on draft and it did not disappoint from the bottle. The price ($12-14/4pk here) keeps me from getting it regularly, but it is one of my favorite beers when I want to indulge."

"My Favorite DfH I've"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O There are definite Barleywine notes in this beer, especially in the oaky malt bill. An enjoyable drinker, not my favorite but a good mix of oak and hops. Not something I was sure I would like, but its pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Solid overall. Curious to see what aged and super fresh versions would taste like - seems this one is in the middle and would've been better either younger or older."
""
""
""
"I bought this thinking it wasn't an ipa. Stupid mistake, ipas aren't my thing. I'm a huge fan of dogfish head but I should have stuck with the midas touch(dollar cheaper). It smelled like the smell outside after it rains and the frogs come out and get squished on the road. I passed it around and several people agreed. After rain smell or dead frogs smell. Taste was a mouthful of hops mixed with grapefuit peels mixed with more hops. I felt the high quality of this beer but I would never spend the $14 on it again"

"O: A very enjoyable beer, worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, hazy, reddish peach coloring that is opaque in coloring, and has no head. There is a sparse film covering, but it is minimal. The nose is subtle to start, but grows rapidly towards overwhelming, with resiny, fresh hops abundant, and a light malt sweetness in the background. The beer's flavors are rich and full, with a roasted malt backbone. A flourish of hops ride off onto the palate, with a peppering and rich, resiny character. Some light citrus highlights and an oaky, earthy tone, as well. The aftertaste is a good balance of malty sweet and hops bitterness, with some oak character, as well. The finish has a mid-linger, and slowly clears the palate, leaving a slight film in mouth. Good brew. Strong flavors on a very easy to palate body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice twist on 90 Minute, but it's an expensive beer that I'm not sure I will keep stocked in my fridge. I'm glad it's going year-round but I don't think I could handle many of these in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DFH says it's a blend, and I believe them. Though not so much in the nose, I definitely taste an old ale in there along with some semblance of an IPA. Perfect head and a near perfect dark honey color. Super hops abound in all olfactory capacities. Again I quote DFH when I say they're Northwestern hops. Way more than just one hop. What ever it is, it smells like a sack of grapefruit from the valley. The Rio Grande Valley - where John Wayne pretended to kick ass and act in that movie from a million years ago. This bottle is a little boo-zay, and I like boo-zay. It works with the malty sweetness. Not sure what kind of malt, because DFH didn't say. 750ml bottle please."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A robust DIPA that stands on its own. Certainnly interesting and in the tradition of DFH pushes the envelope of the style."
"Fairly good, but it's a bit boozier and sweeter than I'd like. The oak does a good job of smoothing out the flavor profile a bit and there is a good balance of malts and hops here."
""
""
""
"Didn't know what to expect on this one. A really great DIPA with a twist from the aging."
"In other words, the aftertaste is tolerable. Hoppiness does not accumulate by the sip. A dangerously drinkable 10% beverage. Dig!"
""
"Overall: one of my favorite beers. Wish DFH sold it year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very, very easy drinking. After a few sips the fruit is at the forefront of my mouth, with hops coming in, and then the feel of alcohol on the ending. Much warmth also at the end, from the amount of alcohol, obviously. The 'bite' that you would expect from an IPA is much more mellow than I expected. I would say the perfect amount of bitterness of the hops. The balance is very nice. Mouthfeel is great, too. Somewhat malty and rich, yet the cleanness of the rest of the beer even it out well."
""
""
"O: This is one of the best Imperial IPAs and Dogfish Head beers on the market. I love this beer and I am glad that I finally get it in my market."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice offering from DFH. One of theirs better brews. Nice hop presence with a great, dry bitterness."
"O: Very interesting IPA given the oak aging. I thought the flavors went together well. I'd certainly have multiples of these in a night however given the 10%, it could spell disaster."
""
"DFH Burton Baton is a creamier east coast style imperial IPA with an enjoyable smooth maltiness, low carbonation for this style, and well balanced hops. It hides the 10% alcohol very well and is overall a solid high end IPA. At 15+ for a four pack, it's a bit expensive, and for the price you could easily get 2 six packs of something just as good. The beer lives up to the hype, but is not outstandingly better than it's competitors."

"Overal I'm impressed but I don't taste the barrel as much as I expected, reminds me of what should be a 90 minute barrel aged"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a creamy texture. Perfect compliment to the array of flavors."
"I've always enjoyed Burton, and it is probably my favorite IPA by Dogfish Head. I'm glad to see it will be offered as a year round in 2012."
""
"Overall: Using oak or any wood treatment with an IPA is a difficult process for sure. Aging a beer that is usually best fresh and still keeping the hoppiness intact is not easy, but Dogfish succeeds here. The oak dries out the body a little bit, which counteracts some of the sweetness from the malt. It is still a little bit heavy on the caramel malt for me, but the oak reduces the impact. Overall, this is pleasantly drinkable."
""

"Overall I liked this beer. I would thoroughly enjoy if given, but would not seek out this beer to buy again. Good but not great."

"gnarley brew, definitely for the hop lover. pours like fresh honey with bits of the comb still inside. smell is citrus hops bigtime, with some biscuity english malts in the background. flavor is huge hops, similar to the 90 minute with that sweetness at the end to balance of the IBU count. alcohol is well hidden, although this is definitely a big beer in taste. mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and medium bodied. not their biggest hop bomb, but its way up there. nice brew fresh at the dfh taproom"

"O: Wow. I haven’t had many regular DIPAs that were this well balanced, let alone a barrel-aged DIPA. Most DIPAs become cloying malt bombs. Eight months in the bottle and the Burton Baton has come together nicely. The standard for oak-aged IPAs."

" A good amount of carbonation delivers a pleasant bite to the tongue. This beer is medium to heavy bodied, a little syrupy, but the alcohol and overall mouthfeel is such that one needs to keep in mind this is a heavy beer and overindulgence will get you in trouble."

""
""
"O- This has to be one of the best I have had so far. Absolutely amazing beer. Easy drinking, great complexity of flavor. Fantastic."
""
"Burton Baton is a mysterious murky color, not unlike cider, topped with a foamy head. The aroma of hops is incredible - strong, lively grapefruit up front with extremely fresh floral notes as well. Very sweet, almost candy-like. I haven't had the pleasure of such an aroma since I've had Flower Power or Pliny - my two fav. IPAs. After a healthy mouthful the beer glides across my palate with a pleasant tingling sensation. At first I am picking up the bittersweet piney flavor and at the same time, a dry earthy, wooden finish. There is this syrupy, yet biting nature of it enveloping the entire experience, which is warming me up as well. I just realized this beer reminded me of a casked IPA I recently had on tap. I think I may save one of these and open it next year... It's a very complex, interesting beer, worthy of savoring!"
""
""
"Overall (4.5): This beer is fantastic. Really, really fantastic. I’d recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hoppier side of things, and anyone who enjoys a complex thinker at the same time. It seemed like it’d be on the pricy side, but after getting into a bottle I’d say it easily warrants the sticker price. Any and all DFH naysayers should drink this beer. Love it."

"Some piney hops would go a long way in this thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well conceived, but feels like it needs either more oak character or a more intense hop profile to generate real love."
""
""
"O: Not much of an Imperial IPA anymore, but fantastic nonetheless. Truth be told, I've never tasted the fresh version and I think it might dissapoint me based on this tasting. I can't imagine it's any better fresh...it just can't be. This is as solid an """A"" as there can be."

"This is a good beer--like a lot of DFH beers, it doesn't solidly fall into any one category. But this one's definitely worth trying."
""
"Boozy, boozy nose starts out this fiesta so immediately I'm thinking I got a bourbon monster here but the flavor is much more mellow and complex than that, mild carbonation and oak with some bitterness that really REALLY lingers. Another Dogfish I'm enjoying after some significant time off from DFH."

"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a cloudy reddish orange, with a one inch head, nice looking lacing, not a ton of it. Smell is some orange, pine, a little breadyness, and some fresh cut grass. Taste is similar, with some oak and some alcohol. Not as much as fresh, but this was bottled on 11/22/10. Never figured out if I like more fresh or with time, I have aged a few on the suggestion of my fellow BA's. Definitely less boozey, but as a hop head less tasty for my liking. Body on the heavy side, but drinkable for it's abv. A very good oaked DIPA."
"O: this is an extremely well balanced brew. It doesn't hit you with that overly bitterness that characterizes some IPAs, which is a nice feature. Highly recommended."
"98."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. It is hard to categorize, especially as an American Double/Imperial IPA, because of it being blended with an Old Ale and barrel aged. However, as with most anything Dogfish Head puts out, it is well worth a try."
"D: I really don't think I could blind taste test the difference between this and DFH 90 minute. The thing that sets them apart, I think, is that this is less sweet and more bitter than the 90 and a much more dry finish. Taste wise though, it's a dead ringer."
"O: Just a great combination of oak, sweet candy-like malts and hops."
"O: Very good, but not as great as I remember it being on-tap. I'm looking forward to aging a couple bottles-I feel like having some of the bitter hops fade and the caramel/orange flavors meld will make for one hell of a beer in a year or so."
"Drinkability. Nice big IPA without being a hop bomb. The wood seems to add some smoothness and mellows the alcohol flavour."
"This is a fantastic beer. I'd be interested to try one with some age on it, but I feel that drinking it fresh may be the way to go. While it certainly isn't a mind-blowing """you have to try this before you die""" beer, I will always pick a couple up given the opportunity."
"Overall, a very solid beer, of course, from Dogfish. Fairly unique, and one that I'd revisit occasionally, though my recollection of the bottled version was slightly less favorable with a stronger oak presence and not quite as much citrus. Definitely worth a try on tap."
"o - Overall a very nice beer, but again, not what I look for in an IPA. Lots of wood and caramel and not a ton of hops. Would like to have this one again, but not when I'm looking for something hoppy."
"T: A good deal of sweetness upfront followed by some nice notes of oak and hop resin. Usually, oak aged ipas don't do it for me, but the oak was restrained enough in this to let the rest of the flavors shine. Really nicely done."
"This is not a typical DIPA, particularly given the blending and aging involved, but it is delicious nonetheless. Another unique and tasty brew by DFH."
"This is honestly one of the best balanced beers I've ever had. Simply put, this is an amazing beer, with amazing taste and amazing drinkability!"
"O - Really enjoyed this one, well formed. Big flavors, great balance, unique IPA."
"Overall, I know I sound like I'm hating on this beer but I wanted to love it and just didn't find it that memorable. A little hard to put down, but the taste was good. Very concentrated."
"O: Excellent IPA. Definitely a sipper at 10% abv."
"Perhaps the beer was store or transported improperly, but not at all impressed. Won't be seeking this out again unless I know it's extremely fresh."
"O: solid beer, as expected from Dogfish Head. Got it for around $4-$5 a 12 oz bottle, and that sounds about right for something like this. The smell is the only unspectacular part."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. I have had this way in the past but didn't review it so it's like discovering a whole new beer. This is a DIPA lovers delight. It should also appeal to the Barleywine lover. It hit right down the middle and has a bit of a wood age on it, which most should enjoy. Bottle dated 07/20/11. A must try!!"
"Bottled 7-20-11. Nice hazy spice color. Smells of C hops very earthy some burnt sugar and a little pine resin. Head develops and hangs on. Taste follows the nose but the sweetness is there and the alcohol is there too. Slight damp wood aromas circulate in the mouth. Very well carbonated. As it warms it becomes a bit winelike. Over all decent but not worth the money."
"Pours a lightly hazed orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, orange citrus and a small oakiness. In the taste, orange citrus hops, a mellow malt, and a nice ending of a small dry oak. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry orange citrus in the aftertaste. Line taste and smell, big citrus but smooth and a nice mellow oak all the way through."
"All in all I'm not sure if this beer warrants the price hike. Sure it is better, but is it that much better? I am not sure. The experience with this beer makes me want to try the Oaked offering from Stone."
"Nice job Sam, way to pull it out of Indiana! Thank God I travel for my job:)"
"This beer would pair well with sushi or any asian food... because it has that soy sauce taste."
"O: This is an excellent DIPA. I recommend it highly."
"Still, it is my favorite of the few Dogfish head specialty beers that I've had."
"Overall a really good beer. Not an everyday or a session beer but a very nice treat."
"Super smooth. Great balance as the oak doesn't push one around. This is a great beer from DFH."
"O- Not my favorite of the 90 incarnations but a damn good beer."
"o - pretty damn good at a year and a half old. watch out for the 10% though, it catches up quick. really wish i had a few more bottles of this."
" An awesome beer...just not what I remembered B+"
"O-Great brew, I loved this brew all around, very pleasant and perfect. Dogfish does it again. Thank you!"
"Not my favorite, but it is a pleasant beer for those who enjoy ones with strong flavor."
"Overall: this is a tasty strong IPA, but it's not really exceptional for me. It seems pretty middle-of-the-road in its class."
"I was surprised by the sweetness of this up front and then was hit by the bitterness and alcohol which lingers for quite a while. This is a man's drink. If IPAs were considered the Martini of ales, Burton Baton would be an Old Fashioned. It's deceiving though, as the alcohol flavor is present, but not overwhelming and the flavors absorbed by the barrel wood help offset this flavor. This is the first DFH beer I've thoroughly enjoyed, and I have to think it has to do with the lower viscosity which balances out the flavors much better than their other IPAs. Now if only I could find a 4 pack in my area!"
"I thought this was a very good beer, very flavorful and dangerously easy to drink. I will definitely revisit this one."
"O - If you can find it, and looking for a one or two beer punch in the brain warmer, this fits the bill. At $13 for a four pack, this beer did not disappoint, even though it was different that what i expected."
"Overall, just know that it is an IPA with smooth creamy not-too-hoppy characteristics and definitely worth trying. The 10.0% alcohol by volume is barely notable in the taste, but after having one, you will know it is there."
"Overall: I love this ale. I wish it wasn't a rotating release and so limited. I have trouble getting my hands on it when in season and it almost seems like the distributers pick and choose what regions get it and it never seems to make it around me in abundance. Which I find unfortunate and hope changes."
"Pours a rich, deep amber with a half-inch or so off-white head which soon dissipates, hanging around the edges. Little to no lacing. Smell is subtle; sweet oak, malt, rich fruit, some earthy hops. Taste is layered. Sweet malts and oak to start off taste, subtle but present hops in the middle; a little piney, some dark fruit, ends with a nice bitterness paired with a warming from the alcohol. Every sip of this beer is packed with richness. It continues to captivate my taste buds. Pricey, but worth it."
"This is a great beer. Earthy, malty, and warm, this is a great sipper for any evening."
"Overall: I am an IPA man and I found my favorite one to date. It has that IPA hoppiness with some sweet notes to the taste. It's a beautiful looking beer and smells awesome just like the taste. The mouthfeel is perfect and leaves me wanting more. Can't even tell it's 10% ABV! Very dangerous! This beer is how I get peace of mind. Cheers."
"o: this is definitely one of the greatest DFH offerings. Very reminiscent of a west coast IPA/DIPA yet unique with the blending and oak aging. a bit pricey but definitely worth treating yourself to once in a while. or buy a case and enjoy it for a while!"
"Overall - I like this beer a lot. It as a well balance of flavors. I love the finish it gets from sitting in the wooden barrels. And the nice strong sweet smell."
"Overall: A very good beer. The beer could use a touch more hops to round out the malty sweetness. It reminds me a little of Oaked Arrogant Bastard, but richer and sweeter."
"Tasting the beer I felt the fruity notes of some flowery hops, as well as a good dose of sweet malts and caramel flavors right up front. In the middle a more earthy hop selection balances the sweet start. Than a greatly composed mix of oak barrel flavors, almost like from a whiskey barrel, build a beautiful finish on the tongue. Again a great beer from dogfish."
"O- I actually really liked this one. Its hard to rate the flavor compared to west coast hop bombs but this one is very well balanced and all of the flavors are integrated. Wish I had more..."
"O- Another really interesting and adventurous beer from Dogfish Head that really works. The alcohol is very well masked for the ABV and full of flavor."
"Overall quite easy drinking for a 10% brew and not as sweet as expected or as their 90 minute. Still, not worth the premium and becomes a bit thin in body by the bottom of the glass and offers only a moderate level of complexity."
"Overall: a roasty 10% alcohol beer that hides any hint of alcohol taste - very nice!"
"O-Good beer with exceptional aroma that doesn't completely carry over to its flavor. A bit boozy"
"Overall this is a very different kind of IPA, and a welcome change at that. The oak adds some nuances to the flavor but doesn't dominate. There's a great balance here among elements and they all work together well. One of my favorite DFH offerings to date."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and I am glad that I can age a few bottles in my cellar."
"O/D-Like my last review (Palo Santo), I was reluctant to try this beer because Dogfish and I do not get along, and a 4-pack is about $16 dollars. Waited to try it until I could no longer resist at a bar. Like most offerings from the company, I am disappointed. Lacks depth and is too boozy. I really need to keep the greenbacks in the wallet and refuse anything by Dogfish Head that has hops. Well, except for 60 Minute...that one is a treat"
"A very good beer a little lighter than your standard old ale/barleywine but still a nice creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of booze keeps this at sipping pace."
"o: really enjoyable beer. one of the best iipa's i've had."
"I can't believe I have not reviewed this, so now I have. To me, this beer is best drank when young to allow the hops to do their magic with the oak and malt. Very good beer, in the top 3 of what DFH makes."
"a bold and charismatic IPA, I just wish it looked a little better... a fun and dangerous beer. the after sensation in your throat is the only way your body warns you of this high alcohol content beer. I'd imagine after about three anybody will be good."
"Mouthfeel is moderate yet creamy and lush. Carbonation is low."
"O: It's pretty good at times, but has a very worty aspect to it that I'm not so crazy about. Lots of just super sweet tea aspects that could user a fresher hop contrast. This doesn't do so badly if treated like an aged barleywine, but I imagine this to be a more dynamic offering fresh. I would imagine too that the oak might be counteracted by livelier ingredients, which would tone down the experience of acidity."
"Overall - 4.0s all around for this one. I really enjoyed this the first time I had it and I bought some extras to age. I've still got those from sometime last year so I'm going to try one of those when it's about a year old and I'll try to add it to this review to maybe compare and contrast a bit. Fresh, this is a fine tasting DIPA. As I said in the taste section it's really a mellow, slow sipper DIPA that I'm enjoying spending some time on."
"A big, malty brew with citrus/pine hops leading the way. I bet age would do this beer wonders and will find out with some time."
"I really enjoyed the complexity of this. Oak was a wonderful touch!"
"Overall - Where do you place this? A IPA/DIPA? An Old Ale? A hybrid? Unknown, so I'll give my opinion based upon what I think this beer COULD have been: One month in oak didn't add much. This still has a strong IPA presence. I would like to see this after 6 months on oak. I'm a big fan of DFH 90 min. In my opinion, this was good, but there was too much of the 90 min present to really allow me to classify this as a separate distinct beer. I liked the idea, perhaps more time on oak would allow for development of its own name."
"Overall - Its worth a single drinking, but for as expensive as it is (I paid $4 for a single 12oz bottle) there are many better options out there at a lower price."
"The aging over oak really makes this beer come together so well, very balanced and very nuanced."
"Great appearance, just like an imperial should look. Nice floral hoppy smell, which are great points but not enough to sell me. The alcohol far outweighed the taste of the malt and hops combined, and was somewhat reminiscent of whisky. Maybe I will give this beer another shot served at room temperature."
"On Tap at the DFH brew pub. Pours hazy orange hue with a long lived white head and much carbonation. Aroma is of apricots, herbal hops with hints of caramel malt. Medium, very tangy body. Lots of hops, apricots and caramel malt on the palate. Wonderful brew."
"This beer pours a burnt orange color and completely see through. There is also a fairly small head that leaves a cap for the remainder of the drink. The smell is definitely oaky and there is q alcohol presence as the beer warms. But my nose was stuffed up so I didn't get much else. The flavor is oaky with spicey hops and a definite warm alcohol presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall a really tastey beer but I think it's an oak aged barley wine not an ipa"
"D- Overall, this beer is best when fresh, but I recommend buying enough that you can age at least 2 or 3 of them. Delicious no matter what."
"Overall- I could drink this one all day, if this were readily available and slightly less expensive, I could have a relationship with this beer."
"O: a great beer, I did not know what to expect and this came out to be a wonderful strong Imperial IPA, delicious."
"Mouthfeel - Lacking in carbonation, feels a little dull and lackluster compared to the taste."
"Love this brew. I'll start with a review of the '09, this is what I am basing my score off of. Bottled 03/30/09 C. Consumed 08/22/11. Color is a deep burnt orange. A fine white foam rises quickly with minimal effort. After a minute, it reduces to a small ring around the glass with spotty clings. Aromas are very woody at this stage, much of the hop gusto has mellowed and melded into the beer. Caramel, cinnamon sticks, oak, and red licorice are all strong in the nose. flavor is very bold and rich. Again, the hop intensity has really dropped, but this allows pine sap, vanilla, oak tannin, caramel, and baked apples to dominate the palate. The finish is nicely firm and intensly bitter. The fine carbonation is very present and compliments the bitterness to form a prickly full bodied finish, cleansing the sticky nectar off the tongue. The mouthfeel is delightful. Up front the beer is very rich and the oak really shines through with this age on it. The faded hops compliment the malts greatly, the malt base has gained more sweetness and the hops have reduced to a sticky pine flavor and a hint of sweet fruit. Nicely mouth coating, and the intense finish with a great deal of carbonation and bitterness refreshes the palate for another sip. Love this beer, 2010 and 2011 review to be added another day."
"D - very easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"This is possibly the best beer I've had."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the feel and the aroma. The mouth gave such a soft aspect to an otherwise pretty stark beer. The hops were huge and blew up in the nose, and correspondingly in the flavor as well. This offering is great for the style, hitting all the standard stops along the way."
"O: Good beer. I haven't had this fresh in a couple years, next time I see this in my area within a couple months of bottle, I will be on it."
"Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass"
" A really good beer, but it does not seem to be a traditional DIPA, then again what does DFH do that is traditional? I enjoyed it, but it is certainly not what I was expected. Seek it out for sure and experience this!"
"Overall, this was a pleasant aging experience. I have one more in the cellar. We'll see how it does with another year"
"Glasswear: Bottle split into two Goblets."
"O: Another finely crafeted brew from DFH. Must try."
"Drinkability overall is excellent. A whole lot of flavor in this one. Very drinkable."
"Overall: Yet another dogfish head beer I am let down by. This is becoming a trend with their beers. Why do I keep trying their line up? I guess I like being let down..."
"Overall, this a superbly balanced beer, and a rare example of an Imperial IPA that stands an equally decent chance of appealing to the novice as well as the expert. Highly recommended."
"This beer is fantastic bottled, but I was lucky enough to sample some on-tap at the brewery, and I think it was even better then. The beer somehow seemed even smoother but just as tasty, if not more. If you're in the area, check that out, because it is worth it."
"Very smooth for an IPA, probably from the oak aging. I really enjoy this beer and hope to land some via bottles."
"O: This is a phenomenal DIPA, and has instantly become one of my favorites. I had this about 6 months ago and it wasn't as smooth or refined as this, so I would definitely recommend letting it sit for a good 9 months or so after bottling before you crack it open. This is a phenomenal beer."
"Normally, I don't like my IPAs balanced. But this works. The balance of malt and hops suits the oaked nature of this. Very good."
"This is a barleywine style beer, that drinks like a DIPA, or perhaps even better. The alcohol is there, but it's not getting in the way one bit. For a 10% beer, I thought it had a great amount of complexity."
"O--This beer has mellowed a ton from when I first had it. It is complex. Very hoppy, but also smooth from the oak and vanilla notes. I want to see what happens to the rest of the ones in my cellar with some more age."
"For 10% alcohol this sure goes down smooth. Excellent flavor and one that I will search out again. Highly recommended."
"O – A very good IPA, but its borderline a barley wine due to its strong alcohol content. Very flavorful. If you are a fan of very stung IPA's, but not really a fan of barlywine's, then this is a good choice."
"Pours a hazy tea color with a small white head which quickly dissipates, but leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of bisquity malts, vanilla and some oak, a hint of hops. The feel is medium with okay carbonation, there is a little bitterness in it. The taste is a little vanilla, some oak, the malts and a little lingering bitterness, much more of a vanilla oak malty taste than an IPA one. Aged a little bit this isn't an IPA at all anymore, but its damn tasty and very nice. I'd love to try it fresh, but its very good aged."
"The beer poured a bright copper/orange color with a medium white head that leaves a ring of lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is the grassy/piney note that you expect from the DFH offerings mellowed by the oak that lends a hint of vanilla. The vanilla combines nicely with the toffee character of the malt. Taste does not have the malt-up-front Im used to and expect in the DFH IPA. Much more subtle. The vanilla/toffee character comes across stronger than I expected too. Very rich and smooth mouth feel. Very little hop bite. Mellow alcohol warming. Very drinkable beer. Dogfish does it again."
"Overall- Another win in my book for the gang at Dogfish head. I think im turning into a fanboy for them. It all seemed to work together in this great take on an ipa. A must try for the hop heads and all others that dont normally go for ipa's"
"Overall, a very good beer, but this shouldn't be classified as a DIPA."
"Cheers!"
"Great beer! One of the better beers from DFH and it is an old faithful in my stable."
"With this one I get my hop cravings completely satisfied, while that secret hankering for a malty aged old ale fits nicely in the cracks."
"O – It’s a bit hard to review this as just a Double IPA. You almost have to review it as a barleywine. Still, it is a delicious IIPA, and one that should age gracefully."
"Mouthfeel is probably the best part. Pretty clean, medium bodied and reasonably smooth. Sweetness followed by a sharp bitter finish. All in all pretty good, but I wasn't blown away."
"Final thought - $3, 10% ABV, dogfish head and ipa. Need I say more?"
"I would call this a nice, balanced barleywine. It's pretty light on the hops (though with no bottle dates, it's hard to know how much of that is due to time in the bottle). But I like it. Fruity, balanced, and tasty."
"O - Imperial IPAs are a tricky lot... I feel this one goes a little too far into malt land and looses some of the aggressive hop flavor that is the hallmark of the style"
"M- crisp, mostly clean with a touch of resin left behind"
"Overall an excellent beer that gets it right. All the right aspects of a double IPA married to an excellent barrel aging."
"D: not really getting any oak, which is kind of disappointing. however, the old and new blends make for a ready to drink DIPA with honorable complexity. certainly a sipper."
"Deep amber color with a sticky head and excellent head retention. Huge aroma of oak barrel and deeply hoppy. Flavors of wood barrel prevail with spicy and vegetal hop character as well as substantial malt body. Thick and chunky mouthfeel and palate flooding. As full and flavorful as any beer I've had."
"O- very smooth and drinkable for 10%. However it is 6:30 pm and I haven't eaten since breakfast and I feel this after just one. This is a beer where I am happy it comes in a 4 pack."
"Drinkability: Ten percent alcohol content and 70 IBUs may not be a recipe for a thirst-quencher, but this is rather drinkable considering."
"Overall, I loved it. This one will sneak up with you. I'm going to have to switch to something else in order to figure out a way to drive home after."
"Definitely in my top 5 DIPA's. Great mouthfeel, awesome hop profile, but the oak and vanilla really push this beer over the top for me. I really wish it was a year-rounder. A hop-heads delight."
"-Cheers"
"its has such a rich flavor and a savory finish, ive had great beers like founders kbs and i feel this beer has so many close notes to a kbs, an ipa with the depth of flavor a stout can only provide until now, world class brew!!!!"
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into my new fancy Stone tulip! Bottle dating seemed to have rubbed off, most likely a newer release bought at Whole Foods for $2.79. Aggressive pour yielded little head but the sediment in the bottle clouded up the beer, left an unappealing dark copper hazy appearance, not much carbonation. Smell was nice caramelized wood, slight piney hops, not overtly alcoholic even at 10%. The taste was just as good, again with the caramel but the hops are less pronounced. Not a ton of carbonation but it works, I like the malty back bone and very little hop bitterness. The alcohol is well integrated here. I had expected this beer to be reminiscent of a barleywine and it did remind me more of a BW than a DIPA. I really liked what the wood treatment did to this DIPA. Good beer, I will drink more of this, and may cellar a few."
"Overall, as a chef, this is what I appreciate about beer the most. Stepping out of the norm and creating something with amazing balance that's different from what everyone would expect. Anyone can create a beer that's totally hop-fucked. But bringing different ideas to the table that adds new and different flavors and sets it apart and gives better balance to the standard is what I love."
"A rich, thick, creamy, luscious, DIPA creation from Dogfish. Kudos to them for pushing boundaries. Although I think this is a terrific beer and a wonderful creation, I wouldn't seek it out. A pleasure to try, but I won't become a regular sipper of this."
"Overall: Nice! Eight ounces are mighty drinkable. Not as complex as the bottled version but plenty delicious, more so if you like sweet/heavy Double IPA's. HOWEVER! No oak to speak of in here, which is weird because in the bottle it sure is prominent. Still, I love this one."
"Narrative: It was a strange existence, being a single guy in a big city. I guess being the webmaster and server technician for Match.com just added to the burn. He knew his own shortcoming, Kyle Rancors wasn’t the most outspoken person, or the most witty, but he had the ability to defrag your kernel faster than most in that bustling metropolis. That wasn’t an entendre, his skills were really that misaligned. Sure, he could carry average banter, had a working knowledge of Gray’s Anatomy that made him seem cloyingly sweet, just no one that a girl wanted to have a raucous session with. Performing maintenance on servers that helped others find love just seemed like an ironic twist of lemon into his heart. He was a good guy deep down, and somewhere, a mediocre enzyme would fit with his substrate complex to create the perfect lock and key. Those are the kinds of things that Kyle Rancors would actually think."
"Overall this is a very fine DIPA. drinks very smooth. this is a great beer to sit back and enjoy as it warms a little in your hands, I'd love this beer during the winter. the 10% will sneak up on you though."
"O: One of my favorite DFH brews... beside the Immort Ale. """Burton Baton""" is one of the brews that defines the term: East Coast IPA."
"Overall - a very interesting brew, and quite good-tasting."
"O- This is a really fantastic beer. It is a unique flavor all it's own, yet at the same time reminds me of many other brews. It is a pleasure to drink and I will be looking for more of it on my trip to Virginia in July."
"This beer is nothing short of amazing. While I'm normally not a huge fan of IIPAs this one has to be the best I've had with the vanilla/oak really making this one stand head & shoulders above many of the others out there. There's a great deal of depth here and not only does it taste wonderful but is also a pleasure to drink. While the high abv does make it one to be enjoyed at a slower pace, it is highly enjoyable all the same."
"D - A bit bitter at first, but it fades. Still finishes a bit hot for me."
"Taste of sweet, mature malts to balance the oak and fresh hops. Not sure what else to say about this beer. Light-to-medium bodied, and drinks like a 6% ABV rather than a 10%. One of the best DFH offerings that I've ever had."
"This might be my favorite DFH offering. Pours a amber/pale orange color. Not much of a head, decent lacing. Smells of oak and vanilla. Tastes of sweet malt, vanilla, has a smoky oak character. Not a lot of carbonation, alcohol is hidden eerily well. Smooth mouthfeel and finish. Wow! Love this beer."
"A cooper Orange pour with a massive creamy head. Head was thick and took a while to settle. Good lacing and retention. Smell of pine, oak, and sherry, possibly from the barrel aging, first appear. As the beer sits and warms, the hops that make this an IPA begin to show up on the mode and in taste. Taste is also if pine. Oily textures and it I'd evident that this gas been aged in oak barrels. As it warms, the alcohol starts to peak its ugly head. A low carbonated beers makes it smooth to drink. Complex as there are different levels at various temperatures. I keep checking the bottle that claims 10% abv. This is hard to believe because it is easy drinking us very well balanced. Alcohol us hidden well."
"I'm cellaring a few and I look forward to trying them again in the future."
"O- Great intense brew. If you can find it get it! It will not disappoint!"
"O - A well balanced beer, the only downside was that I was looking for some cherry in the taste that i picked up with the nose...A bit sugary but still a very tasty easy drinking brew...another job well done by dogfish"
"O: A little bit heavy on the oak/vanilla but otherwise quite good. Hard to categorize this beer, it's a bit out of place in the double IPA category, the old ale is definitely the dominating half of this beer in my opinion. Regardless, very complex and quite good. Think of it as a lighter, hoppy old ale. Tastes especially good at basically room temperature too."
"O- Nice vanilla character carried through both the smell and taste from oak aging. Mellow warming from the alcohol."
"Not an offensive tasting beverage, but I can't say I'm a fan by any means. This is close to being a barleywine, but there isn't any complexity in the taste and it's just too sweet."
" and spicy tastes come out a lot more as you drink it more. You can tell they made sure that every single taste wasn't full on in your face but everything is just enough there so that it has this complete unique blend to it where it all combines into one taste instead of a bunch of separate tastes. Alcohol is very well masked and if anything adds the spicyness that mixes in with the subtle vanilla and oak wood tastes perfectly. Almost too perfectly well balanced. With it being well balanced the two most outright flavors are of course the sweet toffee malts and citrus hops with the other tastes (oak, wood, vanilla) coming in subtly. A plus beer all the way around and another all time favorite from Dogfish Head."
"O- As this beer warms, it gets much, much better; the body gets bigger and the flavor gets bolder. Very good."
"Notes - For an oaked beer, the oak really isnt very present, which is good because it does tend to be a bit too present in IPAs."
"Drinkability is incredibly solid. Extremely unique fruit feeling with a wonderful mouthfeel. I get a fuzz bent off this which just hits the spot."
"O - A good beer I would defenitly be happy to have more of."
"Overall a fantastic Imperial IPA that has a nice mix of sweet and hoppy with a nice citrus undertone. I really enjoyed this brew, even though I am just starting to appreciate hoppy brews."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. It is one of the better offerings from dogfish head. The flavors are beautifully balanced and complex, creating a delightfully refreshing beer that effectively masks the high abv."
"O- Very nice. Not my favorite beer in the style, or even from this brewery, but totally solid. It's definitely a sneaky 10% beer. You don't realize this until it's too late. Very solid, and definitely worth picking up."
"Finish: Great, Awesome, and complex. Explodes with all sorts of texture and artistry. Its a beer meant to be sipped and enjoyed all the way through. Good job Dogfish Head!!!!"
"Overall an amazing brew - sweet, hoppy, malty, and I would love to see how one tastes with a couple years behind it."
"This is a big, sweet beer. Not for fans of dry, bitter IIPAs, but rather folks that like 120 Minute or Southern Tier Un*Earthly."
"O - Not my favorate DIPA, but a still a good beer. Maybe a little malt heavy combined with the oak. It is interesting to see how it changes once it warms slightly."
"Growlee from wholefoods short pump"
"Pours into a snifter a hazy dark amber with 2/4 in creamy white head and good retention of lacing. Aroma is of hops, citrus, spices, grassy, cherries, oaky, and slightly boozy. Mouthfeel is of good carbonation and medium bodied. Taste is pretty much all of the aroma. This is an excellent, refreshing brew and in my top 5 for DFH."
"O: Reminded me of an American barleywine because it was so malt forward. Really nice beer and would definitely get it again."
"Poured dark amber, cloudy, with a white head that retained fairly well throughout. IPA hops in the nose, and some alcohol. Woody and hoppy up front with some citrus note, quickly taken over by sweet malts and alcohol. But these elements exist in a very nice harmony, providing an extremely drinkable brew."
"O - A really fantastic brew that is a great example of DFH's signature style, totally tweaking expectations. Certainly not an everyday beer, but so satisfying and worth the wait. It may be bordering on barleywine territory a bit, but I love the malt profile that DFH IPAs have. I think the other one will be perfect to pop open with about a year on it to really get the wood character to come out."
"O) It's a flavorful beer, and the oak is presented in moderation, so unlike other oak-aged IPAs/DIPAs I've had, I don't feel the need to remove splinters from my teeth 20 minutes after drinking."
"Amazing, and yes I recommend aging it"
"The taste"
"I find DogFish-Head has some nice High ABV beers that desperately need to be aged before consumption. And are sold way to young. Storage means more money so it is understandable why 'businesses' dispense beer prematurely. With this beer I worry what is nice in the hoppiness is going to fade as the booziness becomes more palatable. We will see, I shall age and re-reveiw in a year or so."
"MF: Nice medium-big and a little syrupy at the finish as the sweetness crescendos. Not a whole lot of carbonation keep this one from being too acidic or abrasive on the mouth. A very good beer, which I wish I could have more often."
"Draft to small glass chalice. Color is nice; somewhere between orange and brown, and opaque. Smell is good, but I'm being somewhat arbitrary with that judgment, as my sinus allergies are killing me right now. Tastes great. Like an IPA meets a Belgian Strong Ale. Mouthfeel is equally appealing. Hearty, but smooth. I enjoyed the brew and will definitely have it again."
"This is just excellent. I bought a four pack of this, having one every 3 or 4 months to see how it aged. I wasn't impressed with the aging process until it hit a year. The barrel aging really shows after a year, and just makes this a great beer."
"O: This is a really great double IPA. 4.5"
"Poured into a pint glass. It appeared amber, almost orange and cloudy. Wonderful smells of citrus hops ahead of toasty malts. The first tastes were of those haps that easily mellowed into a slightly sweet malt character. I am amazed by how dry it finished leaving the aftertaste of aggressively, but still somewhat delicate hop taste. Even at 10% ABV this is a very drinkable brew."
"D: quite drinkable - esp. for a 10%er."
"D: Such a nice, interesting brew; the alcohol is fairly well-masked but it does become apparent toward the end; this is a woody and hoppy and yummy beer; nice work DFH"
"overall - definitely a unique beer from the 90 min IPA. another quality brew from DFH."
"This is quite a special beer. It's much like the 90 minute IPA but the appearance is a little darker orange. The aroma isn't quite as hoppy, it's a tad bit more wooden and sweet. The flavor might actually be a little better than the 90 minute to me. The flavors give off this really great earthy yet citrusy hoppiness. The mouthfeel is smooth and yet bubbly, a little oily and semi thick. Really good stuff!"
"O: Great beer. I had been looking forward to trying this beer for quite some time. I was hoping for more of the oak-aged traits to show through. No woodiness or vanilla presence picked up. I'm thinking this is becuase of the high level of hops. Perhaps some time in the cellar would allow some of the other flavors to shine through. Tastes more like a 7% ABV brew. Alcohol is not overpowering, but present enough to provide a nice bite. Nice work DFH."
"Overall - Good. Better when fresh, don't trust what it says on the bottle. It needs the fresh hops to balance out the tremendous maltiness that it has."
"O: I didn't like this beer. I didn't feel like this warranted its own beer because it didn't taste unique enough to be its own beer. That might sound strange but I wanted this beer to give me something new and it just tasted like a regular old DFH IPA. Maybe the astringency or color came from the wood or something, but I really didn't pick up any flavor at all from it. I didn't pick up any oak, vanilla, or anything. It's a pity that I have to rate such a beautiful beer so low."
"A delicious, toasty brew with a hint of vanilla. More flavorful than most 10% beers I've tried. Really want to try this one from the tap instead of poured from a bottle into a glass. The only complainant I have with this beer is that it's only brewed a few times a year. Great for the winter months. Not what I'd reach for on a 100 plus degree summer day in Texas."
"The mouthfeel is slightly heavy for an Imperial IPA, but it seems to go well with the other characteristics. Doesn't seem to be a huge amount of carbonation, and again, is slightly syrupy. Overall, this is a great brew, everything works together to make a beer that goes down nicely, and drinking it is an enjoyable experience."
"Overall it's a good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have one. As said earlier, BA IPAs aren't really at the top of my wants list. I prefer fresh IPAs with a lot less maltiness to them. Hops should be the dominant aroma in a DIPA, not sweet malts."
"Great work Dogfish Head."
"I really enjoyed this one and at 10% ABV I really took my time and enjoyed it. I would love to try this again aged after a year or two."
"O: This """DIPA""" is better with roughly two years on it. The aroma is lacking character, but the taste is quite pleasant."
"The oak has good presence from start to finish. It seems to really help mask the alcohol. Oak doesn't always work but really brings the flavors and aromas together here. Hops play there part and aren't overdone. Very well done."
"Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Two of these at most before the sweetness really gets to me. A little unbalanced in terms of attemtping to blend the hops, malt and oak but the oak is overpowering."
"D: With 10% abv, strong burnt and whisky flavors, I had to sip this one. In truth I barely got through it. Considering the generally positive reviews, perhaps I just do not like the oak and whisky flavor. Must try again in the distant future."
"Body is medium (heavier for the style), with decent carbonation. It washes over the tongue quite nicely."
"Overall - I couldn't notice the 10% alcohol at all and I found this to be one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had to date. Its really well balanced and although it doesn't have a crazy amount of hop taste, there's still enough to please the hop heads out there. If you like a pineapple flavour in your IPA's, you'll really like this one."
"Poured a 1""" head which dissipated completely. Hazy peach tea color. Smell is classic IPA with citrus and pine. Taste is more of the same and rather rich but tastewise I don't think this was dramatically different from other IPAs on the market. And unless the richness was from the oak aging I didn't otherwise taste the vanilla-like essence of wood aging. All in all a good beer but not a standout IPA. Maybe it was my sample?"
"M/D: Very drinkable but at 5 bucks a bottle at the local store ill have to save it for special occasions. Overall another great dogfish head brew. Cheers."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a tiny 1/2 inch white head that fades to nothing. A bit dirty looking in the glass. Spotty drizzles of lacing on the drink down. Smells of pine hops, pineapple juice, sweet malt, and a vanilla/oak wood note. Tastes of herbal pine hops, fermented pineapple, caramel malt, and a subdued woody taste. A mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Beer seems kind of flat overall. A bit thick and creamy in the mouth. Overall, beer is pretty good and interesting as an barrel aged DIPA but I am not too sure I would try this one again."
"Overall, a delicious offering from DFH...a little sweet, but a good fit that suits their usual mojo of in-your-face and high-octane."
"Conclusion: This beer is a treat. It has the straight away, in your face hoppiness of the 90 min. but it also has the complexity of a layered, well blended beer with the oak aging and the spices. I definitely consider this in my top 10 beers to seek out and an old reliable when I just want a good beer without having to think about what to have."
"nice brew - and indeed - a barleywine it has become. matter of fact, reminds me of an 04 Bigfoot i had back in november"
"D: The line on the label on the bottle of Deschutes Hop Henge that says 'experimental IPA' should adorn this beer's label instead. It goes to extremes in ways that IPAs usually do not--most noticeably in the cloying sweetness it presents. This beer is best during its finish, with the presence of the wood really elevating the experience."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden amber. A big, frothy head sticks to the glass and many tiny carb trailers are visible. Looks good! Smell is tight, evergreen hops with a ton of citrus, a lot of mineral, and a little medicinal.. with some muted malt aromas. Taste starts off kind of vanilla-like, then morphs into those tight hops. A bit more of that mineral upfront as well. The finish is an absolute oak beast, very sweet IPA all the while, but tastes like a ton of wood. Feels creamy and smooth, almost a bit slick; obviously, a dry finish. Super easy to drink for 10%. Very good."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle at cellar temperature into a Sam Adams beer glass. A dense white head forms and follows the beer down the glass, leaving pretty heavy lacing in its wake. The dark copper liquor is completely clear with moderate carbonation. The nose is apple skin, dried apricot, and slightly piney hops. The flavor shows apricot, honey, and hops, with a slight minerality and a sourness at the finish. The wood shows at the very end, lending a nice balance. The alcoholic strength does not show. The mouthfeel is heavy and coating. Overall the beer is a nicely balanced IPA, not just a coarse hop bomb, but with a definite bitterness. Both the wood and the hops are restrained, allowing the malt to show through. A very nice American IPA that is a refreshing change from the overdone oak and hop teas that are flooding the market."
"Overall-Definition of average to me. Good, not great, not terrible. I think if I were to age this beer the alcohol would reduce and the fruits would come out. Only problem with that is I like my IPAs hoppy and fresh, and like the hops to be the main attraction."
"Pours a dark amber with a finger of head that leaves quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Has oak, toffee and bitter hops on the nose. In the mouth sweet malt and toffee with some dusty chocolate and a hoppy bitterness. Finishes with a nice tannic bite from thr wood and hops. Very drinkable and 10% and normally not a fan of ba beers but thoroughly enjoy this one and have drank it many times."
"This bottle was purchased based on the sad news of DFH pulling out of WI. Pours a cloudy, golden-red color with a finger of off-white head that leaves lacing (not that I care). Smells malty sweet with a touch of hops. I don't get any barrel in the nose. Smells pretty good. The taste is very enjoyable - a bit maltier version of 90 minute with just a touch of oak. Hoppy, but balanced. The mouthfeel is medium heavy with good carbonation. Very drinkable and something that goes down quick. Maybe a touch too sweet to be great in that department. This is an oak aged ipa that extreme hop lovers won't like, but I think people who appreciate balance do. That said, this beer isn't as balanced as 90 minute."
"Drinkable, very drinkable! This is the way you want to finish an evening!"
"Pours a transparent amber color with an off white head. Retention was decent for a 10% ABV beer. Head left a little lacing as is recessed. Smell is of citrus hops, a bit of malt and alcohol. A lot of alcohol in the taste I noticed. This is more malty than the IPAs I usually get here in the PNW. So it was a fun diversion. Taste is mostly dominated by malts and oaken bourbon tastes. Alcohol still comes in pretty hard. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is pretty muted, but this beer has a full feel. Overall, good beer, but I'd like it a lot more if the alcohol was better covered."
"D: This is a delicious beer. Despite the fact that it is blatantly high in alcohol, it is a smooth beer with a lot of flavor that I plan to try to spread out and enjoy as much as I can. One of my favorite Dog Fish beers for sure. Sit back and enjoy."
"D - This is a very bitter, yet very drinkable beer, and I am certainly not a hop-head. Lots of complexity and a wall of flavor, but balanced enough to be very, very enjoyable."
"D - I like this beer a lot, has a lot of character, good depth to it, long finish"
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, although the alcohol is noticable it is still masked well by the rest of flavors. Can't wait to try one once it ages a year or so."
"D: All around Amazing, especially when cellared, time is worth it but try it first, I only wish I had bought another 4 pack when I had the chance."
"M/D: Medium bodied with a creamy feel to it. Has a slightly dry finish, but low bitterness. Very drinkable, probably my favorite DFH beer."
"Drink and overall: Overall, very drinkable, and enjoyable. I love 90 MIN, and I love oak barrels, so why not put the two together. Great idea. It's a bit pricey, I'm going to say it. But I dont get it everyday, nor can I find it every day so I have a few bottles left that I will enjoy over time."
"Drinkabilty - Its 10% and still has that trademark burnt hop flavor from dfh. The price is pretty steep also. This is basically 90 minute ipa with a twist. Dfh still to worried about making off the wall brews, but this one is acutally pretty good for something different. I wouldnt want more then 1. Worth a try even if you dont like 90 minute ipa."
"Definatly drinkable for anyone who likes hoppy and complex IPA's. I quite enjoy this, at 10% you wouldn't want to slam...bit a couple will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside!"
"The 12 fl. oz bottle was stamped """Bottled On 11/22/10F.""" Sampled on March 6, 2011. It pours a clearer than expected amber-copper with maybe a quarter inch head that sticks around. I like my IPA's to be cloudier. The aroma is nicely hopped but in no way overpowering. They are just about right as far as I am concerned. There is also a nice earthiness going on. The body is fairly heavy but at the same time creamy. The caramel maltiness is evident with a bitter burst of hops all around and maybe a tad yeasty. Complex but solid and easy to drink."
"Solid all around, I will not get into all the technical tasting notes (plenty of that herein). The one comment I have is regarding value: I do not believe the drinking experience of this beer measures up to the price. I am familiar with DFH's line and I thoroughly enjoy most of them and am willing to fork out the typical $10 a four-pack at my local mart. But for $16 I was expecting more. I will stick to their 90-minute - solid and always good."
"the CPJ"
"OVERALL: This is an absurdly drinkable DIPA, but the drawback is that it may only be drinkable for one. Like a rich dessert, this goes down easy, but seems very filling at the same time. Maybe I should try having two in a single session next time I find a 4-pack before I knock the notion, but I just can't see myself having too many of these at a time...oh yeah, maybe that's partially due to the whole 10% ABV thing."
"Overall very, very good."
"Overall a very nice beer. I have another bottle committed to age for a little longer."
"EDIT: Re-review 5/16/11. After tasting this beer fresher, the taste, appearance, and overall ratings are moved from a 4 to a 4.5. No matter if the label claims that this is an ageable beer, this is surely better fresh in every capacity. The hops balance much better with the oak flavors, creating a tantalizing and delicious brew."
"I absolutely love this beer. I cannot wait to see how it changes over time."
"Dogfish Head has a bunch of beers I'm in love with, and this one might be my favorite. I'm always excited when it's released. It's definitely one of my favorite DIPAs. Highly recommended!"
"Had this on tap at Pizza Plant in Williamsville. Pours a pale orange colour with thin white head. Nice head retention and some lacing down the glass. Smells of citrus hops, oak and vanilla. The vanilla is quite apparent. Nice bitterness in the flavour, not as sweet as the 90 Minute, which is nice. Vanilla and oak linger in the after-taste with the hops. Certainly a sipper, but this was quite enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel was rich and luxurious but a bit lively due to good carbonation. Nice beer that was pretty easy going down."
"Overall - Easily make it into my top 5 for two lists: Imperial IPAs AND Oaked beers. I could drink these all night, wake up from the coma happy and rested several days later, rinse, repeat, and encourage others to join in."
"Overall a decent beer and one I'd be inclined to pick up again. But it doesn't really fit the bill for a DIPA. Almost more of a barleywine in some ways. But then I guess style guidelines are meaningless when it comes to Dogfish Head."
"Overall an amazing take on the American ipa with nice wood and vanilla notes coming through."
"D: If I didn't know this was 10%, I would be putting a whole 4-pack down within 20-30 mins... but since it is 10%, I don't think that idea is very wise (or smart for that matter)"
"Highly recommended. Ya dig?"
"Drinkability: For a nice change of pace, this is the DIPA to turn to. Granted we don't get DFH here in New Mexico, and i'll be forced to ration the remaining three bottles, i think this is a really great offering from Dogfish Head. Where other of their offerings seem to be hit and miss, I'd say that this is a definite hit, and a drinkable one at that!"
"D- fantastic, this brew has tons of depth. Probably too malty for most DIPA lovers who want hops hops and nothing but the hops, but I love the balancing act."
"This is not how I remembered Burton Baton but, again, I was trying to age a few bottles to see how it fared. When fresh, malts tend to be bordering barleywine territory with tons of hops on top. The hops have definitely mellowed out but the malts still haven't quite found their place like in an aged barleywine. Time will tell but with about 6 months on this batch, it's not faring the way I expected at all. Decent but nothing great."
"D - Outstanding beer. Love the idea, and the execution is almost perfect. Definitely worth trying, even if for the experience."
"Overall, solid oaked ipa, not the best but damn damn tasty"
"Enjoy!"
"Full bodied for an IPA, slightly sticky with a long dry, bitter-sweet finish. I could happily drink a couple of these in a sitting, but the 10% abv keeps it limited."
"There are many more DIPAs that I woudl reach for but for a wood-aged IPA it is not bad."
"Overall, very drinkable and easy to sip."
"I like it, no session but a couple makes the cheeks rosey!"
"Fuller medium body, sticky and dry. Much less warmth while drinking than some other 10% abv beers, and some great flavor here. The boatload of hops on top of the typical DFH malt bill makes this one pretty memorable."
"This is an amazingly drinkable beer considering its alcohol content. I will definitely seek this out again."
"D- Good IPA and the oak aging blend comes through quite well and makes this memorable."
"On tap at DFH poured into snifter glass. Poured a deep amber color with a 2 fingered white head that slowly disappeared into itself. The nose was brown sugar, malted barley, alcohol, oak, floral hops, pine, and hay. The taste is immediately malted barley, pineapple, sugar, and oak that transition into vanilla, and piney hops. This is a deliciously blended beer. I love the malt liquor or strong ale taste that also has the qualities of the 90 IPA."
"Pours amber with a small white head and lacing on the glass. The smell is magnificent: lemon, chocolate, booze, lots more, very complex. The taste is the same, many different layers with a nice hop bite and just the right amount of alcohol. One of my favorite brews. Can't give enough praise for this beer. Amazing!"
"This is a sipper for me. The ABV comes through enough where you do not want to drink too many."
"D - a very tasty double that kicks you in the teeth and leaves you wanting another, up there with the 90 minute for my money"
"Honestly, Im just glad I found this. It was the last 4-pk in the store and I have not seen it in any of the other local beer shops."
"The alcohol is well disguised behind what seems like a high FG and the oak. This might be better aged because it isn't all that hoppy."
"Cheers"
"D- this is a nice iipa and one of the better oak aged out there. Maybe a bit too hot, maybe a bit too sweet but all in all a good beer."
"Definitely enjoyed this one- absolutely worth trying!"
"D: A remarkably drinkable 10% beer. The flavors all complement each other well and nothing outshadows any other flavor. A great IPA that I wish I'd tried sooner."
"D - The 10% shows itself slightly and the oak aging adds a booziness which makes it somewhat of a sipper."
"O-A very desirable well balanced heavy hitter that is quite a treat and goes down quite effortlessly. Sure to not disappoint."
"D- If this weren't $14 a 4-pack, I could drink this everyday! Makes me wish this NY winter was over already so that I could be sitting out in the sun grilling!"
"Bottled 10/14/10. Pours a cloudy orange rust color with a small white head that disappears very quickly. Scent is a nice mixture of delicious hops and strong malt backbone. There are sweet caramel and vanilla notes as well with a bit of citrus and wood. Smells very delicious! Tastes delicious too! Definitely borderline between DIPA and American Barleywine Style. I first get tons of sweet caramel malt followed quickly by citrus hops and floral notes. Then I get some tasty oak flavors with a bit of vanilla and brown sugar. There are also some dark fruit flavors and some booziness. Mouthfeel is very full bodied with a bit of syrup..A bit of alcohol burn, but that's not a bad thing. Drinkability is scarily high for this big beer. I have some aging, and interested in how they turn out with some age."
"So after a few years, i enjoyed this one more, maybe it was that it was fresher, maybe just me. It is an above average DIPA, better served in the winter, and sipped slow. This would be a good one for hearty pairings, or cold camping trips around the fire."
"Pours a golden orange. Very clear and well carbonated. A good amount of white head and great lacing. Smells hoppy and mostly oaky. Lote of woody hints on the nose. Tastes smooth and strongly malty with lots of hops on the tongue. A very drinkable beer at 10%. solid mouthfeel and definitely one of my favourites"
"Thanks cam!"
"Burton Baton pours a dark amber color with a nice foamy head. Smells of cedar and citrus right upfront. Tastes of grapefruit, sweet malts and cedar with earthy notes. Mouthfeel is crisp yet somewhat creamy. Drinkability is higher than it should be for a 10% beer. Though the 10% is hidden very well. Nice."
"M - Nice, smooth mouthfeel."
"drinks okay. has tons of potential and was probably groundbreaking half a decade ago, but just needs to tame down that sweetness a bit."
"I love this beer with a bit of age on it. Can't wait to try the others a bit down the road."
"Mouthfeel is quite strong - decent heat."
"A poor man's 120. Comes in four packs for $12.99. Perfect for sharing, when you don't want to spend $8 a bottle."
"Overall I think I like this better than the normal 90 minute IPA. I like that the malt character isn't as bold nor sweet and the oak aging adds a whole new dimension that I really like."
"D: OK. One is good."
"D: didn't really think and oaked aged IPA would work but it was tasy and drank quite well. Definitely have to seek out some more of these oak aged IPA's."
"D: Very drinkable brew, though i think Todd Alström's review make this beer sound like something God would drink, while I don't see this as Dogfish Heads best brew, it is definitely a very fine and enjoyable drink."
"D: drinkable but at 10% this one will get you. this maybe my favorite IPA i've had to this point. i could have another 12oz after this but it does seem like a thicker beer than most IPAs. i'm really loving the vanilla notes. IPA people this is a must try. to say im enjoying this would be a understatement"
"One of the best from DFH"
"Cheers!"
"Spectacular beer; really need to find some more."
"D - well, it's a very good IPA...but I don't see myself drinking much of it. If you like unearthly then I would recommend you try this, as you may like it even better. I'm happy this came in a 12oz."
"This ale was amber in color with a minimum amount of foam, but what little there was, left that lace on the side of the glass. The smell of fresh hops, along with a fruity aroma and a hint of oak filled the nose with a soft pleasant aroma. The flavor of hops, citrus and a hint of oak filled the palate with a pleasant, well balanced flavor. I really like this brew. Not overpowering hoppy flavor, but hoppy enough to be my kind of IPA. What a pleasant surprise that I shall enjoy from first sip to last gulp!"
"This beer has a great aroma and has great flavor. The alcohol is there and you can tell. It's a great beer and I will probably have plenty more."
"The feel of this beer is big. The flavor kicks it to high gear as soon as you you get the first sip down. A hot warming feel accompanied this beer but does not challege you or make this beer less drinkable. A big beer with a kick, you can feel this after a few sips."
"Seems more like a barleywine than an IIPA."
"I usually don't like Dogfish Head's IPAs, but this one isn't bad."
"Very interesting and delicious beer."
"Drinkability is remarkably high for a double-digit abv beer. It is so smooth and feels so good, it's hard not to reach for another."
"D: Deceptively drinkable for a 10% abv beer. The well-rounded, complimentary flavors of hops, malts, and pleasant earthiness from the oak made for a uniquely enjoyable experience. However, I slid the rating down because towards maybe 1/4 of the beer left, the alcohol became more and more noticeable in the flavor profile. Strangely, the last few sips tasted like an overly boozy barleywine and nothing like the beginning few. If there existed a consistent taste from start to finish, I could easily see taking down another... then another."
"Poured from 12oz to NB Globe. Bottled on 11/19/10"
"This is a monster brew to for the week of taste buds. For sipping and savoring."
"First beer review on this website. So, Im gonna caution this with saying, IM A TOTAL HOPHEAD. 12 oz bottle poured into regular pint glass. AROMA hits you right out of the glass. Exceptional double that creeps up on you. A must try for all hop heads and overall a good beer for anyone."
"Another great treat coming out of DFH!"
"D/N - Very drinkable is the sense that all the flavors meld well together, to create an awesome complex brew that makes you want more and more. Although the ABV% would have you drunk in no time."
"This bottle was dated 8/13/10, so it's roughly five months old. It says it ages with the best of them so let's see. It pours a muddied dark amber in color with a one finger off white head, and little sediment. The aromas have certainly faded. There is virtually no hoppyness at all. It wreaks of sweet malt and that's all I can really pick up. The flavor is good but not what it is when it's fresh. It's a nice blend of hops and sweet malt. The hops have faded and it's sweeter than normal but it doesn't really take away too much. It's still pretty good. It tastes more like the Squall right now. It drinks like it's from one of their 750s. It's exceptionally smooth with little carbonation. Because the beer is pretty subdued, this is perfect. This beer is a very drinkable Imperial IPA. I highly recommend it."
"It's a sneaky beer, for sure, at 10% ABV, so it's probably good they only come in 4-packs. You could easily drink a lot of this beer and not necessarily realize it."
"Buy it now, buy it often. I know I'm probably going to grab a 4 pack if i can, drink two and age two.."
"Pours a very nice orange/copper with a big frothy white head. Good lacing and retention. Hoppy aroma. Citrus mostly, woodsy notes as well. Great flavor combination. Starts with some refreshing citrus hops, grapefruit and orange, before moving onto some more pine notes as you get into the beer. The oak is definitely present at the finish along with a little vanilla which creates a sweet malt to balance out the beer perfectly. The alcohol is almost completely masked, only showing up if the beer gets overly warm. Excellent."
"This rates at the top for DIPA for me. It doesn't get any better than this."
"I didn't know quite what to expect with this one, but I am quite pleasantly surprised. Balanced and full of flavours, this is easy to appreciate."
"D - The only reason this beer isn't rated as high in drinkability is because of the higher ABV, this one is a ass kicker if you drink to much of it. Really and truly a great beer though that I will be revisiting in a few months to see what cellaring does."
"Overall - Thanks Tribepride.... This is good."
"Pours a dark cherrywood into an oversized wineglass. Tastes a good pine and grapefruit mix of hops. Has a hint of carmel but is not a malty mess like i experience with typical double ipas. Finish is smooth and has a slight aftertaste i cannot identify. Very drinkable considering the high abv. It sneaks up on you but by the time i finish the glass i can feel it on my face. I very glad i tried this even at the price of $7 for a 10 oz glass. Best double ipa I have had."
"D- Burton Baton is one of the best DIPAs on the market. An absolute great taste, feel, an ability to go down. No question I will snag these all the time"
"I really would like DFH to release a fully oaked DIPA instead of a blend."
"This is one of those long awaited gifts that never fails to satisfy. One is gloriously enough, two would be overkill."
"Future outlook: Gonna' have to suck it up on the price and grab some more of these..."
"D: This is for sure one of my favorite DFH beers. Good flavor and wonderful balance make this a beer to seek out."
"Drinkability: That 10% ABV is VERY well hidden; 2/3 of the way through the glass and I'm just now noticing the buzz. Definitely a beer for hop heads, but, it's a very well balanced beer and I could be suckered into a larger glass of this. It's a sipper, but a very pleasant one."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability- This is one amazing beer. So complex but so good. If you keep trying to pick out diffrent flavors you'll drink yourself stupid. Sip and enjoy."
"Burton Baton is a terrific beer! I suggest trying some if you haven't already. This is my favorite dogfish head beer that I have tried."
"A very drinkable beer -- a very good DIPA."
"This beer pours a bit of a hazy light copper/dark honey with a thick, clingy white head. The aroma is moderate-high hop--mainly lemony citrus and a noticeable warm, vanilla boozy notes, quite appealing. The flavor is quite complex, initially a citrus/spicy hop flavor hits, followed by a smooth, caramel-raisin malt, and then finishes with a bit of warming alcohol and a pronounced hop flavor and firm hop bitterness. The carbonation is moderate and body medium-full. Overall this an extremely flavorful, unique beer that I find extremely enjoyable. The beer has many dimensions, especially as the temperature slowly rises."
"beautiful amber color with near white head billowy head. aroma is immediately of hops, but not as pungent as you would expect form a DIPA. taste is bitter upfront with a sugary sweetness in the finish. a little bit of citrus mixed in along with a slight burn from the alcohol. mouthfeel is clean, beer goes down without much of the aftertaste that hoppy beers can leave behind. very smooth."
"I will note that this is one of the few offerings from DFH that I will repeatedly seek out. I think Burton Baton is a great beer, and having had it on tap as well, I would say that it is even better fresh from the source. Definitely check this out if you have never tried it. It won't knock your socks off, but you should find it very enjoyable."
"Highly enjoyable beer."
"This beer is very sought after because it is a barrel aged IIPA, which in most attempts fall up way short. Not in this case. I will be returning to my beer store in hopes I can get my hands on a few more of these."
"It was hard for me to believe this was 10% until I'd consumed two of them and started feeling the buzz. A damn fine beer."
"A pretty impressive DIPA - the oak influence is applied with a subtle hand - split between the varied sweetness supplementing the base caramel malt, and the further astringency lent to the big hops. And the nice round 10 points of booze? Seamless. Sure is nice when it feels like I'm opening presents again so soon!"
"A very well crafted and blended beer, Dogfish Head nails whatever it is they were trying to produce here, if that goal was to make a deceptively drinkable and smooth high alcohol DIPA. They also get high marks for the only decent barrel aged hoppy beer I've yet to try, a combination that usually ends in tears and tends to be a waste of time. Worth seeking out, and as the label suggests to hoard away from non-believers."
"This was sort of a breath of fresh air from DFH - big beer, with big flavor AND big drinkability. I believe this is a better beer than either the 90 or the 120, by far. Somewhat unique and so satisfying."
"Regardless, this doesn't taste much like a DIPA... even an old one. I don't know what I'd call it but I don't think its really DIPA. Nonetheless, this is a very fine beer and I recommend it. Cheers!"
"D - The high ABV is very well hidden on this one, nice bold flavours, strong hop presence with a nice wooden and caramel finish. Great balance and highly recommended to any DIPA fan."
"I could see my self drinking this again but at 20$ a 4pack it will be a treat every once and a while"
"D - I'm glad I got the chance to try this beer and espcially on tap...although the nitro did nothing special...a very hoppy, English-style, oak aged, doulbe IPA...leave it to Dogfish Head"
"Pours a clear dark amber with a thin white head. The nose is woodsy hops; maltiness, citrus. A complex tasting DIPA, balanced incredibly well by the oak characteristics. Malt is dominant in the middle and the hops kick in with bitterness in the dry finish. Smooth, creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Taste's great and is super drinkable. One of Dogfish Head's best brews and an all time favourite."
"Overall it's pretty good but not one of my favorite doubles. It's obviously a high quality beer tho, and you should certainly give it a try sometime."
"Malty taste, caramel and bread with a citrusy, grassy hop presence. Alcohol warmth. A bit thin and high alcohol, but overall very nice."
"D: Pretty heavy for a session, but the taste is pleasing, so I might space out a few over a couple hours and be well satisfied."
"d- not the greatest, this is the 2010 vintage and i think it's still a little too hot for me, gonna put the other one i have in the cellar for a year or so and give this another shot to mellow out a bit."
"D - decent brew. Just gets a little too sweet. Still has a nice hop flavor."
"Burton Baton is an interesting concept of a beer that Dogfish Head executes very well."
"Drinkability - Very good, nice smoothness about this brew, it is almost like a fine single malt scotch, since its an occasional brew from DFH I highly recommen giving it a try when the opportunity presents itself. As always with DFH this is another wonderful creation and another one gets hit over center field out of the park."
"Over all I really enjoy it. I have a feeling that I need to seek it out on tap or in a fresher bottle to experience it as a true hoppy DIPA, but with a couple months age it's immensely enjoyable in another fashion which is why I feel comfortable reviewing it. I'll revise my review if I find it to be very different fresh. As this bottle stand this is a breat cool evening in front of a fire with a good book style brew. I picture smoking a good ciger to compliment, but I wouldn't want to overpower the beer. It just brings that kind of image to mind."
"Great drinkability for 10% abv this one is amazing, highly recommend as it is on par if not better than squall IPA."
" "
"This beer pours a deep amber color with very little head. The aroma is a tad astringent with notes of raspberry. The front is slightly hoppy. It finishes with a hint of caramel and those raspberry notes; reminiscent of the dumb dumb suckers I had as a child. This beer reminds me more of a barley wine than an imperial IPA. Almost no hint of the oak barrels some of this was aged in. Either way, those are my two favorite styles so no complaints here!"
"This beer is medium-bodied, with a nice mild carbonation, and very drinkable considering the ABV."
"Quite drinkable, with a nice balance of DIPA base and wood aging; often, IPAs and DIPAs can be overly oaked, but here the oak lends a nice flavorful touch. Well-done."
"This was a nice sipper but didn't blow me away. Maybe I should have let it age a bit."
"This was a great brew. It was a great drink. The ABV is kind of high, but still a solid brew. Very crisp and full of flavor. The look of this brew is amazing and it just folds out from there. Another great brew that I have had by DFH."
"A top notch DIPA. Very enjoyable all around. I would absolutely buy this again."
"D - This is a big beer, and one must treat it as such. The complexity of flavors are not for the uninitiated, but come together as one hell of a symphony of a beer. Sip and savor, as it's obvious much time and thought was put into this brew."
"D-The high abv does not really make its presence felt. As the beer warmed it became better."
"It's very disappointing that I only saw this in a 12 oz. bottle. I wish it was more of a 650 ml. bottle because it's really good. I could put a few of these down, no problem, even though the ABV is quite high at 10%. If the alcohol content was a little lower it'd be easier to drink more; three of these would put many over the edge."
"My wife said its like sweet hops and pineapple"
"A deep dark flavorful brew. One to sip, savor and explore. Very worthy and nicely complex."
"Silky smooth. Defs a sipper."
"O: I wouldn't chill this much, if at all. It's a sipper for sure and gets richer as it warms. It's 10% so the drinkability is going to be low and honestly, why would you want to session this anyway? Akin to brandy, I would seek this out again and will revisit this on in a year or so as the other three I bought age. I expect great things from this beer as it gets some years on it."
"D: High alcohol, but a nice tasty IPA makes for a once in a while sipping beer."
"D- All around very good. A definite positive addition to 90 min."
"Bottled 08/13/2010. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Pours a slightly hazy red orange with a one finger off-white head that subsides slowly to a minimal amount. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and citrus hops. The flavor is of big sweet malt, citrus hops, grapefruit, and dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is a pretty nice brew. Very nicely balanced flavor with a very nice aroma going on. Not a lot missing from this one, it is just a little more malt forward than I usually like, but still a damn good brew."
"Drinkability: An impressive double IPA with good character. Imagine the 90 minute, amped up a bit and aged like the Palo Santo Marron. A fabulous wood aged beer."
"D/M: slight carbonation tingle, very smooth on the pallet, hopiness lingers on the tongue and filters its way into the nose so you can almost smell it as it is being swallowed. This brew is easy drinking but has such an incredible depth it is hard to put down"
"taste wise the oak definitely comes through, with a bitter finish, i also detect notes of caramel, there is a very faint alcohol taste. a nice cold weather IIPA"
"Highly drinkable, but it definitely caught up with me in a hurry."
"i first bought this as a single on a whim. what a treat this is. the first beer i have ever had that i was sad when the glass was empty, i did not want it to end. so i went back to the beer store and bought all they had left. ehehehehe over a case and a half. i am aging a few and working on a few on special occasions. this is the nectar from the gods."
"While most top 100 beers are great on special occasions, this is a staple of mine that I enjoy on a regular basis. It goes well with dinner, football, and especially as a late evening treat. One of my all time top IPAs!"
"D: dangerously drinkable,would drink it all day long if it wasn't 10%. hardly any alchohol taste, making it that much more dangerous."
"M - crisp; medium body; subtle effects of high ABV"
"M/D - A bit on the thick and heavy side. Filling for sure. Strong though. I think I'll be seeking this brew out again, but don't expect to be drinking more than one in a session."
"Notes: Oak aged IPAs are an interesting concept, and a hard one to pull off effectively. I think the two-thread blend approach actually works very well. Unique combination of flavors. I enjoyed this beer, but it may not be for everyone. This is the first aged bottle I've had. I prefer it fresh."
"Smells real oaky with a bit of a lemon zing to it. Has a real thick foamy white head that lasts. Tastes very oaky with a dry bitter hop finish but will get sweeter with age. Feels pretty good but a bit sticky and too creamy. Drinks real well but its hard to handle more than one in a night."
"Notes: A very good, solid beer. I actually tasted this beer two days in a row; the first time in a Dogfish Head pint glass, the second night in my Duvel tulip. I really enjoyed the smell on the last 3rd out of the DFH glass, but the whole beer was more enjoyable in my trusty Duvel glass."
"The hops don't overpower the palate for me. Just enough to enjoy but not destroy. Highly recommend."
"Drink- I am very sad I only had 1 12 oz. bottle. Guess I need to go back for a 4 pack now."
"jake"
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. The mix between the flavors keeps everything fresh and complex, while the 10% ABV is hidden incredibly well. The only thing I could see detracting from this beer is the overly sweet front-end."
"Overall, another above average offering from Dogfish. Not my favorite oak aged IPA (I think Cigar City owns this category in my opinion) but well done none-the-less. Alcohol is masked very well by the oak and the 6 month aging. I would recommend aging for 6 mo to a year just like the 120, but if you let it sit too long you will lose all the beautiful hop characteristics and you may be left with a sweet oaky mess."
"Sante!"
"Overall, I could drink this IPA any day. It's got a nice hoppy bite but not too over the top. The malt content of this beer definitely smooths over both the hops and the high alcohol content."
"drinakbility - again this beer is 10% and is as easy drinking as apple juice"
"D: All day long. Just a wonderful creation."
"Drinkability is solid, but the alcohol and hops make one beer plenty."
"Overall - Call it blasphemy if you will, but I actually quite prefer DFH 90 Min IPA over this one. This is still a great beer if you're looking for a strong, hoppy, and delicious ale to sip on though! I just ended up liking 90 min more I guess."
"Mouthfeel/Drink-ability - Toasted flavor that reminds me of bread. This is a great IPA for one of those nights craving something strong."
"The head is minimal but lacy, crisp and surprisingly light on the palate, complex and woody flavors, and a slight coffee hint in the bitter aftertaste."
"D: VERY drinkable"
"Nice mouthfeel, pleasant carbonation. Creamy texture as it slides down. Damn is this drinkable. For 9% you could easily down 2 or 3 without knowing it."
"Well done DFH. The hits keep on coming."
"I will have to get this on my next trip to Mentor."
"Hazy pale orange in the glass with an off-white head. Smell surprisingly includes sweet brown sugar alongside the expected piney hops. What creative genius thought of aging an IPA in bourbon barrels?! Mouthfeel is dry and sticky--at 10% alcohol, I'd think that nearly all the sugar must be gone, but the beer is still rather sweet. The smokey, oakey effect off the bourbon barrels is clear but not overwhelming. The typical IPA characteristics are somewhat subdued, but remind me of other Dogfishhead IPAs. This is an interesting, balanced brew. I'm glad I found it tonight at Hi-Times."
"Not having this side-by-side with 90 minute makes it hard to tell the difference, but damn, this is a tasty beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Showed an amber orange with thick creamy head, great retention and lacing. Smell of fruity/oily hops, smoked wood and bready malts. Taste sweet and fruity, citrusy grapefruit and apricot up front, similar to the 90 min IPA, then going to the bitterness from the hops and balanced by some smoky wood notes. Hides the alcohol extremely well and very drinkable considering abv. Excellent beer for any big IPA fan."
"The beer leaves a hint of alcoholic warmth that lets you know this treat packs a punch. It's really delicious and the 10% is well hidden, I suggest starting off with this one and not sticking with it all night or drink it alone to cap the night."
"Not very drinkable. Takes quite a bit, especially after warming, to finish this 12 oz. I love most wood-aged beers, but this just wasn't done as well as i had hoped."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. The oak aging really adds a nice element to the beer. I would highly recommend this one."
"D. One of the best beers I've had in awhile. I've not had this one fresh and I'm not sure I'll be willing to mess with something so beautiful by drinking it too early. Dangerously drinkable for a 10%."
"Poured a slightly hazy dark Orange color with a small white head. Smelled like vanilla, oak and Robitussen. Medicinal oak! Taste is similar to the smell but I think the alcohol is too noticeable. This is hoppy but not as hoppy as i would have thought. Feel is thick and tingly. One of these is enough, not super drinkable."
"Overall pretty solid. Would drink again, but I'm not in love with this beer."
"D- I'd like to try this a little fresher...the hops are a little too muted, and the oak is coming through a little much. Maybe something with 6 months age or so on it..."
"Drinkability - I don't think I would ever have two of these in a row. However, for it being such a high abv, I truthfully do not taste alcohol in the sip, though I do get slight warming of the throat. Not bad at all from DFH and I definitely like it more than their 90min."
"This beer was great. It had an amazing amber color that looked so delicious. The hops were nice and present in the smell. It tasted awesome! Nice bitter hops, smokey malt, a little cirtus, toffee. It went down really smooth, and coated the mouth nicely. I really really enjoyed this beer. I could drink these all the time if they were a little bit cheaper. All in all though, this is an amazing beer. Dogfish head does always seem to impress though, don't they?"
"All in all, this is an incredibly balanced IPA. If you are looking for super dry hops, this one does not come through. If you want balance between hop and malt in your IPA, then this one is for you. I like this brew"
"This beer is very drinkable if you ignore its ABV. Quite a tasty, not over-oaked IPA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Taste is very balanced, has a tiny bit of a shallow mouthfeel but very tasty. Definitely a very good IPA, I wish I would've picked up more than a 4 pack."
"For 10 percent ABV, it's dangerously drinkable. Perhaps the msot drinkable 10 plus percent beer I've had. For a DIPA, this certainly is one of the sweeter, maltier ones I've had...bitterness very restrained for style. I believe that only enhances its drinkability. I was hoping for more oak flavor, but that's certainly not a big deal."
"Well done Sam Calagione"
"D One and done for me but I think that this is true to the style. This is to be sipped and enjoyed and it certainly was by me today. 3.5"
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkablity for the ABV. The dryness makes the beer fairly tolerable considering how sweet it might be without the barrel aging. Bottled only a couple months ago; I'd like to try one after some aging to see how it evolves."
"As an IPA drinker I prefer the Imperials, the most. This brew is very smooth for its ABV, which has to come from the oak barrel it ages in. Cloudy Amber in color, with a lacy cream head. The aroma is Oaky, Hopy, and you can definitely smell the ABV. The taste is what, you smell oaky and hopy with a vanilla finish. I have four on my shelf in the closet I am aging... love this brew!"
"D- With the alcohol content, and sharp bite of this brew, I do believe one here and there would be enough. Good treat to have one of these, definitely not an every day thing."
"Another dfh gimmick; yes. But its good and worth trying, especially if you want a quick 12oz that will get your buzz on."
"D: I really love this beer. Sure we really cannot get it where I live before this year but it is a damn fine and singular example of the style. There really is nothing to compare this beer to. Excellent beer."
"D: High for the abv's"
"The mouthfeel was consistent with imperial ales, in that it was heavier and a bit creamy. This beer went down easy without any bite. The flavors of hoppy bitterness is delicious, but doesn't give you a kick or linger for too long. It left me eager for another sip. This is a very enjoyable beer to take your time with."
"Medium bodied and light carbonation make for a silky smooth mouth feel. Very drinkable for 10% ABV."
"Very drinkable at 10 abv it does have a punch but this beer is so so very good I bought a single bottle to try and was wanting more"
"Excellent in areas, and a bit off in others. Overall pretty good, but 1-2 would do fine."
"Burton baton poured a dark hazy amber color witha nice tan head that lasted throughout. There is vanilia smells, and a hoppy smell as well. The taste is overall amazing. The oaked age ipa stands out most, with hints of vanilla, lots of hops. A strong flavor, and overall a fantastic beer. one of my favorites."
"D: A very well made and drinkable IPA."
"Drinkability is super high. If they could make these in 5.5%, I'd by them by the case. Good stuff. Can be dangerous at 10%, so be careful, beer lovers."
"D= Went down pretty good for a higher ABV would like to play around with this one a little and maybe age a few of them. Really good beer."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable. The Alcohol burn is mostly hidden from all the Malt and bitterness from the hops."
"mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, very well done there; average carbonation. it's a sipper for sure, but one that's going down pretty easily. i will say, while this is quite good, i'm not sure it's worth the $ markup from the 90 minute."
"D - this is an awesome sipper! I really enjoy it."
"D- Probably as drinkable as a 10% abv could be, smoothness and flavor was the highlight of this beer, it may not be one I'll drink every night, but it's one I'll look for again on the right occasion!"
"D - No alcohol noticeable despite the 10%, and this goes down as easy as any standard IPA, but offers so much more. Outstanding."
"D- Potent glory. I have trouble finding this, but I want to buy a case to keep around and play with different age levels."
"Bottle. Oak aged IPA. Pours a copper color with a big 2 finger white fluffy head. Some oak notes in the nose, thought that it would have more. More sweet smelling than hoppy but you do get some hops in the nose. The taste is pretty sweet with a pretty decent lingering bitter taste. The oak really wasn't that prevalent to me. Minimal alcohol taste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Good stuff. I could drink a few of these. Though, it is a hefty one at 10% abv. This is one I will definitely revisit."
"D - I'm surprised by how fast I drank this beer. I could easily go through a 4 pack of this beer even though it 10%. Very drinkable but only to a degree considering the ABV."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 09/13/10. Pours a hazy orange color with a medium-sized head. Good lacing. Smell is hoppy and floral. Taste is woody, with a sweet taste and some warming alcohol flavors. Smooth, and surprisingly drinkable. The IPA and wood flavors blend well. This is a great beer that packs a good punch."
"D - Very nice beer that is quite drinkable but be sure to sip it as the alcohol content is pretty potent. BE careful with that 10% ABV which will catch up to you."
"bottled on 8/13/2010. Drank 9/ 14/2010. This poured a golden amber with a 2 finger head. Some fruit and carmel aroma. Not nearly as hoppy as I would of expected. Mild oak and good amount of malt. this was easy to drink. I would seek out another one of these!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Very complex, very challenging, with new flavors blossoming in every sip."
"This is an excellent DIPA and is an excellent drink at 10%. Easily one of the best barrel aged IPA's I've had."
"Drinkability: I think it's more drinkable than the 90 minute. High praise, but completely deserved. I wish I had a tap in my house."
"T- Malty and citrusy with a numbing tingle in the back of the mouth. It's defintiely got an oaky taste, as well. It is apparently mixed with 90 minute IPA, which is my favorite beer. This is sensational. The oak-barrel aged part of it gives it more of an alcohol kick. Not quite as good as the 90, in my opinion, but still sensational."
"Good beer!"
"Very quality beer. Reminiscent of an American barleywine. Hop-forward but very well balanced with plenty of malt. The oak adds another layer of complexity and texture one doesn't normally see in a DIPA."
"D: I certainly didn't struggle drinking this, but the oaky bite makes it a little less drinkable for me than other Imp. IPAs that I have tried."
"D- Good for the style, but the hops and abv can be pretty intense."
"Notes: The first time I had this I wasn't that impressed. I would definitely suggest aging it for at least a year. It's a completely different experience."
"D: Very easy beer to drink with the flavors that I love and I am familiar with mixed with vanilla and caramel. Take note: with a 10% ABV, I got a good buzz out of it."
"A very well done wood aged IPA"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer during Raleigh Beer Week. Served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy orange with a thin somewhat lasting head. Aroma is a nice blend of pine hops with a decent bit of oak. The taste is a nice balance of caramel malts with brown sugar blending nicely with pine hops and a nice oak and vanilla kick, providing an enjoyable complexity. The beer is a bit on the heavy side, but is still a very easy drinking brew, well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable draft beer, one I would certainly have again."
"D: Certainly a rare treat rather than a session beer, but I mean that as the highest compliment."
"D/M: Light carbonation but its a really big beer. So it does stick on the palate. Very good style though and I liked it"
"D-the wonderful taste lasts throughout the experience, however the bitterness becomes more evident towards the end of the glass."
"This is one of my top beers, hands down."
"Burton Baton is just an awesome brew, I love it. A bit too heavy to session but a couple in a sitting is not out of the question. I would drink this regularly if available."
"Drinkability -- Not bad. On the whole, probably my favorite DFH IIPA. While certainly hop-forward, it's still quite malty and could pass as a thin American Barleywine. It's a good beer for certain, but dyed-in-the-wool hopheads may wish to look elsewhere."
"Malt body, sweet grain, vanilla, and oak, round out the taste; earthy. Very little perceived bitterness. Full bodied, medium carbonation, and an ample amount of alcohol heat on the swallow. Hops impart subdued flavor but the overall mouthfeel and fairly neutral pH make up for the lack of hops flavor. Dangerously drinkable."
"OK this is the best beer dogfish head makes."
"I had this just with some artisan honey bread, and it was very nice. But I'm thinking beer ribs, stews, chilli, roast chicken, or Indian food. The Burton Baton will not disappoint."
"D- An excellent beer to relax with. Strong flavors with a smooth taste is very hard to do but this beer manages it well"
"This is a dangerous beer because I could drink this all day - and I'd probably regret that at 10%."
"A very good hop hound, I may even put this above beers like Double Trouble. Give it a few more ABV and it could even topple Double Crooked Tree IPA. A very good Imperial IPA."
"I really dig this beer. Gonna buy a 4 pack for the cellar and see how it fares once the hops fade."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear, kumquat color with one finger of tan head that retained well as a thin cap. I saw a good amount of rising carbonation and the lacing was good too. The aroma was a spectacular and confounding blend of spices and various malts atop a hint of appealing booze. A truly great aroma is like lingerie on a gorgeous woman and this was that. The flavors were also a delicious, complex, big blend. I tasted (multiple?) caramel malt(s), chocolate malt, a lot of wood (oak), residual sugars, tropical fruits, complex citrusy hops, and spices. Weird for a Double IPA and very sugary for one as well. Yet I have trouble deducting points for this because I feel it is trying to expand the idea of what an Imperial/Double IPA could/should be. The mouthfeel was as smooth as silk, the body medium/full and the carbonation low. Love it or hate, I had to conclude: try it."
"D: Given its strong nature, it's a sipper, like a good Old Ale or Barleywine. That being said, I love it and would gladly have a case at my disposal. Not having had it fresh, I can't say how it compares, but as a stand-alone tasting I can say pretty assuredly that this is one for the cellars."
"Notes - Oak-Aged Impreial Double India Pale Ale. Every word of that caught my attention and Im glad I picked this one up at Jacks's Wine Sense in Ewing, NJ. This beer ranks up there with the best of them, DogfishHead makes good beer, this one is great beer."
"D - Remarkably drinkable for a 10% ABV beer."
"D - This is worlds better than the 90 Minute IPA, with strong notes of vanilla and oak balancing out the big malts. I could always use more hops in my DIPAs, but this turned out to be a well balanced, big, robust brew. Some residual sweetness from the malts adds up by the end of the glass, but this is still fantastic."
"D: Flavorful, enjoyable, nice feel and remarkably balanced for a beer this big. Slow drinker though due to ABV."
"Overall: I dont think this beer fits the style. To me, it is more like a barley wine. That isnt necessarly a bad thing, but I was expecting a DIPA. This beer is definately a sipper. It is decent, but I doubt I will pay $6 a 12 oz bottle again."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. One of my new favorites. I bought a four pack and will let two bottles age awhile... looking forward to that!"
"The drinkability suffers a little due to the boozy finish. This is a very complex and flavorful DIPA that I would recommend trying!"
"It's like a gueuze...only with IPA constituents. Alright. It pours a somewhat cloudy orange-amber topped by about a finger of light ecru micro-foam. The nose comprises light, crisp grapefruit, green apples, vanilla, and a more-than-healthy amount of creamy caramel. The taste echoes the smell, with a strong caramel base highlighted by some sticky pine and light citrus. The body is a stoic medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly resinous finish. Overall, a more-than-solid DIPA, though it would have been nice to get more oak (rather than simply a firm maltiness). It also paired rather nicely with my stovetop Szechuan chicken in a peanut butter-enhanced sauce..."
"D- its a fairly strong beer, its a good one to sip on and enjoy the flavors as it warms"
"This is a year old bottle aged in my cellar. Pours a dark amber with a great head that leaves lacing, beautiful. Nose at this point is all sugar and malt with some booze. Intense nose. Taste is great and very barleywine like. Huge sweetness up front, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, followed by some bittering pine notes, next some alcohol, and a lasting bitter finish in the back of the throat. Complex and lots of wood also there. Mouthfeel is heavy and super sticky. A winner from DFH, my second fav of theirs after Palo Santo."
"D: The alcohol is noticeable but for the most part well hidden given its strength, although there's no way I could have more than one of these in a single sitting."
"Kinda pricey at first, $12.99/4 pack, I really just bought this on a """why the hell not, I enjoy bashing DFH""" kick, and was so pleasantly surprised by what I got. Easily my favorite DFH (although I'm sitting on a WWW, so who knows what'll happen when I drink that)."
"D - I was pleased to try this on tap on my birthday - I really highly recommend it if you are a fan of American Strong Ales which it has more in common with than Imperial IPA. The flavor is like the beer equivalent of Grand Marnier - excellent drinkable flavor and a true nightcap, but so good anytime you can enjoy- World Class!"
"Once you get past the alcohol this is a fairly complex beer. As others have said its pretty similar to 90min. I prefer this over the 90min any day."
"The sweetness had died down with two years of age. All the same flavors are still there, but they are more polished and integrated. Flavors are still syrupy and malty overall, but the hops are still going strong. I liked this beer better with some age, but it's still not as good as fresh 90min. Not quite an dipa and not quite a barleywine. Basically age polished it up a bit and mellows the sugar."
"A very tasty beer with a lot of sweetness and good hops. A very interesting semi-dry finish despite the syrupy feel and sweetness. Very enjoyable."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is piney, orange, oak and resiny hops. The flavor is resiny and piney hops with some orange notes. There is also some caramel malt to balance things out. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"burton baton is a pretty drinkable beer. dogfish head does some pretty wild things. one of my friends says that dfh brews seem like wild home brew experiments that they decide to bottle. i definitely would like to give them more credit than that. i enjoy burton baton as well as other beers they make."
"Well-balanced and complex, this is a great offering from Dogfish Head. Alcohol is almost completely hidden, but the sweetness limits the drinkability a bit. (Update -- this mellows very nicely after 1-2 years in the cellar.)"
"Not something I would want to have a lot of. A really interesting beer, but quite similar to 90 minute IPA."
"Overall, it's a big brew, so not the most drinkable even on a curve. But I love the flavors here and would certainly love to run across this on draft again soon!"
"This beer just gets better as it disappears. As the temperature comes up a little, the taste of bourbon comes on and the hops get oily and find the back of my mouth. The balance of this beer is exceptional, and the alchohol is only noticeable at the start. It's sweet, smooth, piney, and just barely bitter enough for a strong DIPA. Kinda hard to find so hock your girlfriend's engagement ring and buy extra!"
"Just shy of being full bodied. Nice, slick texture. Chewy, even. Big fan of the mouthfeel. It's an easy drinker. Tasty beer, but not a great IPA, much like 90 Minute."
"D - Remarkably drinkable for a 10% ABV beer."
"Pours a clear amber with a small head. Lace sticks around until the end. The smell is very sweet upfront. As it warms up a little a grapefruit smell becomes more noticeable. Tastes a lot like the smell, a little too sweet for my taste. It seems to lack the balance that their 90 min. IPA has. A little oak can be tasted and the alcohol is a little too noticeable. It's also very syrupy. Not bad but I'll take their 90 min. over this any day. I'll cellar a few and check back in on it."
"A superior blend, well done without being """experimental""" compared to many of DFH's brews."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, super easy to drink when you consider this is a 10% beer. I would like to drink a few more of these and would pick this up if I saw it again. However I wouldn't go nuts trying to obtain it."
"Will drink this any chance I get!"
"D- Very enjoyable and a nice sipper. I did drink it two right after buying the four pack, and one eight monthes later. It is good fresh but I feel gets better with age, and would really like to try one aged more."
"D: I enjoyed this beer, but I feel it is a little bit in no man's land and would be better (hoppier) fresh or better (malty) with 2-3 years of age rather than the 1 year this one had aged. Still, one of the better DFH beers and one I would be interested to try fresh and another year older."
"Overall - Good but not outstanding. The barrel gives it an interesting slant, but I'm not entirely convinced that it pairs really well. It's not really enough of a departure from the old standby, 90 Minute, to convince me to keep buying it. This one was pretty fresh, so I'll sit on the rest of the pack to see if a year or two brings about any perceptible changes."
"D - I really like it for the style and a definate must have again. This is so much different from a west coast style but so much a great east coast ipa that is oaked aged no less again a must try."
"D - Very strong beer, not for the faint of heart. Slow sipper, one at a time."
"D: ABV isn't entirely hidden and it just feels like a massive beer...enjoyable, but a definite one and done."
"The taste is thin, I was hoping for more from this beer. It was hoppy, it had some woody characteristics from it, but too thin for the alcohol content. Gets overwhelmed."
"Full bodied, nice carbonation, smooth, and easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a really nice beer, that I could drink several bottles of."
"I prefer this to the 90-minute, but both are at the top of the east coast DIPA category."
"D - Burton Baton is probably one of the most drinkable IPAs I've had. I'm sure, even without a big wood flavor, that barrel-aging this definitely helped it. It's smooth and sweet but well-balanced and warm. The alcohol definitely kicks in within half the glass but it never becomes overwhelming."
"Drinkablity is really good on this one. As the beer warms, the alcohol becomes a bit more present but I cannot tell it is 10%. I do have to knock some points off however, because the 12 ounce bottle cost $6."
"Tastes like big, smooth cereal--the nicest, firmest dose of pale malt I've ever come across in a double IPA. Not syrupy in the slightest, nor off in any way. It's just extra biscuity, accentuated well by chewy yeast and balanced just slightly at the end by some spicy English hops."
"Great strong beer."
"It's not a stunning beer, and given DFH brew some pretty extreme beers I was expecting something more overwhelming from an oak-aged IIPA. But it's surprisingly balanced and surprisingly drinkable - something certainly worth taking a look at."
"At a little over a year of age, this one is still tasting wonderful. I'm not sure I would go over a year on this one, and even waiting past a few months may be too much. This is a finely crafted IPA, and would benefit from being young. But, that being said, at a year, it's still pretty darn tasty."
"Definitely try this if you like big malty sweet beers. Not much of a hop presence at all."
"D - Well I couldn't find a 12oz bottle there but a bigger bottle was available for 12 dollars and to me seemed too high to pay for a DIAP. Bought a ST Iniquity for 9 bucks instead."
"An interesting offering from Dogfish and not quite what I expected from the style (though bring preset expectations to a Dogfish beer is a bit of a ridiculous proposition anyway). The malt body was really quite big, and the wood wasn't nearly as pronounced as I would have liked. Dogfish Head intrigue me, but they're yet to blow me away."
"Overall, an interesting drink, one I was glad I had. Tasty and not overly sweet like the other DFH IPAs. Worth a shot!"
"I'd say, definitely make it the last brew you try on any given day. It will wrap its """hands""" around you and choke the hell out of you."
"D: Very dangerous beer. This one makes you feel so good you could throw back a few before you realize what's going on. Drinkability is very high but be careful!"
"D: Not advisable to have more than one on an empty stomach."
"I wish I had a fresher bottle to review. I found that the hops were there but not as up front as the 90 minutes I've had before."
"D: A bottle is good to share between 2, but three people is spreading it a little thin."
"What does this add up to? Beats me. This is one of the toughest beers I've had to 'score'. It's thick, deep, bitter, sweet, & oaky, It's very good. I don't need another, but this one is vanishing at a rather alarming rate. A- it is."
"really like the balance of this beer. 10% abv is well hidden. reminds me a lot of 90 minute ipa. good beer."
"D - I would drink this all day if I didn't fall off my chair. At 10% ABV I couldn't pound back very many."
"pours a slightly hazes copper color with a nice 1 finger staying head and beige ring..looks good..smell is of a 2ipa with tropical fruit but this one has a oak smell as well but not strong just right..the taste is DFH 90 with a oak and tropical fruit taste twist..the mouth feel is full it full of hops grapefruit malt toast citrus and oak..if you like DFH 60 or 90 you will like this one ..only regret is i bought a single and now it is gone til next spring..this is a good one"
"Pours a slightly opaque, light copper color with a thin head that fades to a ring. Before I even bring the glass to my nose, there's a strong aroma of bourbon. Upon closer inspection, I get a lot of toasted malt aroma with hints of floral hops and what almost smells like chocolate. The taste is more bitter than I was anticipating from the aroma, with a tongue prickling bitterness the entire time its in you mouth. Underneath that there's a good deal of warmth from the alcohol and a full, creamy body with nice, toasted malt flavor. The finish is lingering and astringent. Drinkabliity is very good - there's a lot of complexity to this beer and with each sip I want more. Very interesting and delicious!"
"Way to go Dogfish Head!"
"This is an interesting beer. I think as a DIPA I'd really dislike it, but as something else, it's kind of good. I'd like to age some to see if it mellows out."
"D - liked it but it wasn't what I thought it would be based on the style. definitely would have it again"
"Deep reddish-amberish color, nice head. Oak and malt dominated aroma. Alcohol is well hidden, for 10% abv. Sweet, sweet finish, with a hint of heat. I wouldn't drink more than a couple bottles in a sitting, but it is a tasty, interesting brew. Plus, I already have a bit of perma-smile after two..."
"I was very excited to try this as I have yet to see it around my area. Was surprised to see it at the fest and gladly went straight to their tap handle. Glad I did. Worthy of an attempt."
"Very enjoyable beer. I feel kind of a hit and miss thing going on with Dogfish, but this offering is definitely a hit!"
"Mouthfeel is great...buttery smooth, light but full, slightly sticky. Makes for a terrifically drinkable 10% beer."
"D- This is a damn good IPA but sadly the high ABV limits this one. This beer kind of restarted my love again for the Dogfish. Good job guys!"
"D: An outstanding DIPA sipper with a unique, bourbon-barreled quality. According to the brewery, it ages with the best of them."
"Overall this is a good Double IPA that veers close to an American barleywine. Worth a try, especially for barleywine fans and hopheads."
"(D) Very drinkable. I had this after I had a Mirror Mirror and I was still able to get great taste out of this and I savored it a bit."
"(D)- A fantastic DIPA. Possibly one of my personal favorites to boot. If this is how it tastes after almost a year on it, then a fresh bottles would be ridiculously potent! I loved this the first time I had it and this is just like I remember it. I could easily have a few of these if the alcohol didnt catch up with me."
"This is a blend of a strong British ale with DFH's 90-Minute IPA, but the IPA is too assertive for much of the ale's characteristics to really shine. If you didn't know better you'd swear it was another IPA offering from DFH. And that's nothing I'd want to miss."
"D: Pretty much what I would expect from a DIPA with the DFH logo on it: aggressively hopped with a lot of sweet characteristics to it. The oak barrel adds an interesting flavor dimension, but in the end I don't think this is any better than the 60 or 90 Minute. A solid DIPA, but not worth the $5/12 oz bottle."
"D: Very smooth for a 10% ABV, yet don't think I could have more than two (this isn't factoring in the 10%)."
"Dr. Very easy sippy beer."
"Overall, I have mixed feelings about this one. I thought this was a really interesting and creative DIPA that had its moments particularly in the nose and certain characteristics of the taste. However, given the finish and the sweetness, the jury is still out for me. Will have to give this one another shot."
"D - very drinkable given the high ABV."
"D - Could easily get you into trouble. 10% alcohol is barely noticed (until it is too late)."
"This is definitely something I could enjoy in a smaller portion. I'd be curious to see how it ages. too bad i just drank my second bottle. Off to City Beer!"
"Taste: Smooth and balanced. Very nice fruit (pear and apple) flavors with syrupy brown sugar and grapeskin bitterness that starts slow and crescendos up towards the finish. The finish is fairly short, resinous, fairly bitter with some woody undertones. Mouthfeel is moderately viscous."
"I can see why even with so many reviews this is still a standout."
"Overall= Wood, wood, and more wood, a bit over done, I think so and thats a good thing. Much props to the many DFH ales that have pushed the limits of unique styles and aging. The Burton is a beer that hides it's ABV and prides in it's taste(s)."
"Another great beer from DFH - a malty DIPA/strong ale that retains drinkability but with some kick. Nice."
"D: I can't believe this is 10%. Barely a hint of alcohol. I hesitate to call this a session IPA, but it sure drinks like one. Wow."
"It wasn't until I tried this beer on tap that I had that epiphany. Often, beers of this type are better from the bottle than from a tap; the opposite is true of Burton Baton. It pours a beautiful deep amber with plenty of head. The nose entices with aromas of pine, citrus, and oak. Taste is similar, with plenty of aggressive hops rounded out by the oak. This is a wonderfully complex beer, with lots of flavors mingling harmoniously. I could drink this all night (or at least until the 10% ABV puts me on my ass). Definitely a top 10 beer for me and easily my favorite Dogfish offering."
"Amber orange with light orange highlights around the sides. Impressive, dense off-white head billows for a minute but quickly dies out. The aroma is nothing like an imperial IPA, and that might be a good thing. Lots of caramel and toasted malts hit the nose and a very very subtle citric hop component in the background. One taste and you realize this is a truly imperial IPA indeed. The first rush is a doughy, sweet, sticky kind of experience, but the citrusy/grapefruit-like hops follow it up right there, ready to kick some ass, and it might be yours! This beauty sticks all over the place - tongue, cheeks, teeth, throat, and makes you want to go back for more. I'm yet to be disappointed by any Dogfish offerings."
"OK, I have to ding this one a bit for lack of complexity. I'm really not getting the """two thread blend of young and wood aged Imperial IPA.""" In fact, it's reminding me a lot more of my first Bell's Hopslam, which I had for the first time (and did not review) about a week ago. Not a whole lot of complexity, just pretty much in-yo-face hops. To me, a better balance of hops to malt would help bring out the hops. As it is, the tongue suffers burnout after one beer. A good beer no doubt, but a bit off the charts for me."
"Well, lotsa of flavors, the smell is much more blended than the taste. The flavor is a damp wooden kind of quality, Oak I suppose with a very bitter edge on that Oak. The juiciness of the hops comes after the bitter edge and supports it to the aftertaste, which retains much of the bitterness and the Oak. The malt in this is sweet and supportive to just how big this beer is but I have trouble telling when it's at play in the profile. The mouth feel is full and sticky, much better than most IPAs or even Doubles I've had lately."
"Poured into tulip a dark amber, brownish orange with a nice tan creamy head that gathers excellent lacing all over the glass. Appears rather dark for an IPA, but is expected due to the oak aging and blending of these ales. It does actually look quite a bit similar to the 90 minute, but this should come as no surprise. Scent is nice oaked maltiness, with a bit of hop fruitiness concealed in the background. Very balanced. Great smell here, really enhances the entire experience of this ale. This has a great, creamy feel about it. Not overly carbonated, very pleasing to the palate. The alcohol content is masked on this bad boy, making it super drinkable. Just be sure to consume wisely."
"Pours a nice orange-amber color, with a beautiful collar of thick, white foam. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit and oak. On the palate, more oak, vanilla, grapefruit, caramel and a hint of alcohol. A very nicely balanced beer, an improvement over 90 minute."
"I really want to try this puppy after a year or three of aging in the cellar."
"Pours a deep copper with a solid head of white. Smells of citrus hops. Up front there is alittle burn followed by light malt then the hops hit. It leaves a nice lacing in the glass. The mouth feel is AWESOME...could be the silkiest feeling beer i've ever had. I'm getting to much to hint at the barrel ageing but it's still VERY good."
"Spicy alcohol in the finish, but I would have guessed less than 10%. I would have liked carbonation to be a little higher but I guess that's to be expected with this abv. Usually my problem with DIPA's is too much over the top hoppiness, but I think in this case the malt sweetness was overdone. Well-made, but not one of my favorites."
"Pours a light golden amber. I smell citrus hops and malt, with a little alcohol at the end. Taste is sweet malt, a little bit of hops, honey and strong alcohol. Mouthfeel is good, perfect amount of carbonation, it's very pleasant. Drinkability is insane, even though it's 10%, it's extremely drinkable, if on tap I would drink this all night."
"D-beautiful for one but I couldn't drink more than 1 or 2 in a row."
"This is a very fresh representaion of Burton Baton (bottled 3/1/10) and I would love to try one with some age next to it. I think a bit of time, 1+ year, would morph the qualities here a bit and meld the sweetness into something a bit more drinkable. Still a decent beer, but nothing I would drink in quantities greater than 1. I'll be back."
"A slightly hazy orange/amber color body with a lasting foamy offwhite head leaving tuns of lacing , lively carbonation. Aroma is of oak , alcohol , citrus , pine , caramel and leather . Flavor is cirtusy up front fading to a big caramel malt sweetness , oak and some nice piny , earthy hop notes , nice level of bitterness ,full body , sticky mouthfeel . big hoppy finish with honey and alcohol lingering . Very drinkable and a very good brew ."
"Copper amber with a creamy eggshell cap of delicate foam that leaves fine lace on the glass. Pine sap,tobacco,toasted oak and a mentholy botanical note make for a complex nose. Pineapple,dark fruit,pine sap with caramel malt and toasty vanilla oak flavors. Crazy good complexities really come alive as this beer warms up a bit. Full bodied with warming alcohol in the finish. I think the recipe for this beer has changed. The bottle says: """a two thread blend of young and wood aged Imperial ipa""". I believe it was a blend of barrel aged English old ale and 90 minute ipa in the past. A fine offering from Dogfish."
"D- A little boozey to be considered truly drinkable, but not bad for a beer packing 10% ABV."
"Drinkability: It'd be hard to have a couple of these in an evening, but this single twelve ounce bottle I had was fantastic."
"Dogfish Head really puts it all on the line with this amazing offering. Simply put, this is a great sipping beer for a quiet evening."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol presence is not very strong in the flavor, but it certainly mellows out your mouth as you drink it. This is a """sneaky""" strong beer, that I am sure you could drink a few of before you lose all feeling in your mouth. This a very good DIPA from DFH who seem to know how to make a hoppy beer."
"M/D: It does seem to be a little over carbonated to me, and I was expecting something more from the oak aged factor. It taste like a regular DIPA, unless my pallet is refined enough to pick up the oaky smokey factor. Still a good beer though."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable, I would even say """dangerously""" drinkable. If it wasn't for the fact that beer makes you drunk, and IIPAs make your really drunk, I could drink a 12 pack of these in a sitting."
"amber color with a good bit of fluffy head, that stuck around for most of the beer. lots of thick lacing on the cup. Very smooth hoppy flavor, also with what i thought was a strong oak and malty flavor. great beer that i recent enjoyed on a warm spring day, but would have to say might be a better choice for late fall/early winter."
"D - Too damn good."
"D-The flavors are melded very well and integrate nicely with the overall appeal of the beer. I really enjoyed this one this time around (hadn't had it in years and didn't have much recollection of it.) Alcohol masked very well. The only real downside is it is a bit pricey for what it is, so won't ever be a go-to of mine. I'm not the biggest fan of 90 minute, but this is just worlds apart in my opinion."
"D- I a huge IPA lover and I could easily put down the 4 pack it comes in, but I wouldn't suggest over indulgence"
"D: I tasted this brew this past summer for the first time, it was the first brew by DFH that changed my mind about the brewery. This one goes down easily, some what filling, alcohol is dangerously well hidden. Having a few will do you in, but you can't help yourself with how well this is blended."
"D: As mentioned before. Highly approachable. A nice balance between hops, malt, oak. Will definitely buy again. Almost wished it had a little more oak influence."
"On it's own, it's a slick, decadent treat for the DIPA enthusiast. I've got one more bottle aging a while longer, I suggest you'd do the same. That is, if you can resist Burton Baton's temptation."
"D- Very good considering the style."
"I just read the bottle and it says """Please share it with loved ones and hoard it from the non-believers.""" I couldn't have said it better myself. THESE GUYS ARE GOOD!!"
"Overall this beer was decent, but not one I'd go out of my way for. If you like this style it's worth a try at least once, but there are better one's out there that are also less expensive."
"D-Very good brew....beautiful, solid, and tasty...whats not to like? If you want an Imperial IPA, maybe this is not the ticket, but if you want a tasty strong ale...step up. I know I will again."
"Not a beer you can drink much of, but works as a desert beer or a night cap."
"I wouldn't refuse a freebie, but I won't buy this again. It doesn't stand out in any important way."
"Taste is very strong and botanic hoppy, although sweet throughout but it seemed a bit thin in all. still, well carbonated and perhaps summery (welcoming the current northeastern weather), but strongly alcoholic- the only slight downside. nice beer."
"Drinkability is decent considering the ABV. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I'd prefer one bottle at a time."
"Overall a tasty brew. Try it if you can. You won't be able to drink alot of it but a glass you can handle."
"D - This is a sipper, but one I could have a few of. This would be great with a fine cigar. Class act."
"I would happily pair this with anything spicy; think Indian, hot wings, anything with some heat."
"Well worth the $14 for the 4-pack."
"Overall- For the price, I would not run out to buy it. I think there are plenty of other beers that are flavorful that are in a better price-range. Having said that, this is a very good beer. It is very clean and nicely brewed, but out of simple preference, I would probably pass on buying it again. There are too many other good beers that I haven't tried to spend $13 on a 4-pack of this one."
"Bottled 3/01/10."
"D: Very dry finish, but at 10% it's definitely got a little kick to it, not exactly a session beer."
"First sighting in California of this brew at Hi-Time Wine Cellars. Pours a rich mahogany color with some orange to it. Little head for a DIPA (and too dark), but thick with good retention and evidence of lacing. Aroma has brown sugar, sticky flora, oak, and alcohol. The flavor prominently features caramel malts in large quantities along with an assertive bitterness with some resinous and floral hopping. The finish maintains the floral hop flavor with an excess of caramelly cookielike malts. This beer is overloaded with its simple, cloying malt character and while it is balanced with bitterness there is not much complexity in the hop bill either. Despite all the malt and hops it is still a bit hot too. Medium to ful bodied with a tight, medium-full carbonation. I just can't get into this beer much, I just don't find this one too alluring."
"D: Have to take my time drinking this one. sit down, relax and enjoy."
"A nice innovative beer from Dogfish Head. I almost feel like its one of their more balanced beers."
"Dogfish Head, Burton Baton. This beer is an oak aged imperial pale ale. It's a blend of an oak aged English strong ale and their 90 minute IPA. It poured a clear golden sun orange color. It smelled like a fresh pine forest, melon, grapefruit and orange blossom honey. It tasted like citrus/piney hops, toffee, roasted malts, some honey and a hint of wood. It was interesting to have the malt in there. It's not a huge hoppy beer but I felt the malt balanced the wood and orange aftertaste."
"Overall one of the best IPAs I've had. I will definitely be picking this one up again next time it's released."
"A great beer by a great brewer, highly recommended."
"D- Pretty big and boozy. Its really close to a barleywine. A sipper of a DIPA for sure."
"D: Very smooth for a 10% ABV, personally this is one of my favorite beers, but could get dangerous with more than a few. Excellent DIPA."
"This is a delicious IPA that rivals Dogfish's 90 Min. IPA brand."
"Not bad, but I don't really get any oak flavor at all. Seems pretty much like a standard DIPA. More style than substance as far as I am concerned."
"Overall Impression: This beer almost reminds me more of a Barleywine than a Double IPA, yet it still has the drinkability of an IPA. It has a flavor profile very similar to Troegs Nugget Nectar, however the flavors are more concentrated, but the hop bite is subdued by the vanilla and oak. Very interesting. I LOVE this beer!!!"
"Drinkability: Nice and balanced. It's got a high abv but it's easy to drink. I really enjoyed it."
"Beer pours a nice copper color into a glass with good head. Leaves a nice subtle lacing on the glass as you drink it. I want to like this beer but it's got an alcohol burn kind of like drinking whiskey to me. It also leaves a very lingering bitterness in the mouth, which for me doesn't work. Perhaps if I paired it with food it might finish better but this is not something I want to drink alone or have multiples of."
"Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated. Drinkability (even with the relatively high ABV) is still good..I could have a couple of these with very little issue."
"Bottle date of 10/16/09. Pours a clear amber color with a yellowish stained head. Abundant amount of lace clings to the glassware. Wonderful aroma of vanilla, malt and hops. Hop character is citrus and somewhat fruity. Taste is bitter hops blended with malt and vanilla notes. Medium feel with low carbonation. Little bit of woodsy taste and smell as it warms. Very drinkable and quite complex. The oak imparts a complimentary aspect for the other flavors to play off of. Warming finish and more alcohol comes through as it warms. I really enjoy this beer, whether it is fresh or aged it is great."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer! Very smooth."
"Nice body, ala 90 minute, sweet and viscous. This is an easy drinker. Glad to try it on draft at the Gaitherburg DFH Alehouse."
"Bottle pours a slightly hazy dark golden orange with a decent amount of foam forming in the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. The smell was very nice in this one, fruity with a hint of piney hops. The taste is beautifully bitter with a sweet malt background. No hint of the 10% alc what so ever. So smooth and easy to drink. A very delicious treat. Glad I picked up a bottle of this over the weekend."
"d: not a session beer. a great sipper at 10% + ABV. the second half of the bottle is ten times better as it warms, the flavors open beautifully. a wonderfully complex, floral sipper."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The oak isn't too offly strong in this beer. I just recently had a Weyerbacher Insanity, and the barrel aging was much more obvious. I've had hoppier Barleywines, and this is supposed to be an Imperial Ipa. Never the less, it's a well crafted and tasty beer to be sure."
"Cheers!"
"This beer does a superb job of hiding its 10% ABV... dangerously drinkable. Makes the visit to the alehouse totally worth it!"
"Mouth/Drink: Nice full mouthfeel. This is a sipper for me. Its filling, but delicious. Couple 12ers and I'm done. Wish I could drink more."
"D: This ones a little too hot right now to be very drinkable, but having said that I would not turn down a second one!"
"M/D- medium-full bodied and nice and creamy. i like the 90 min alot, and i like what DFH has done with the barrell ageing. wish this one was year round. very good."
"The first time I had DFH on tap and it is just as delicious as I imagined it would be. DFH never disappoints me."
"11/27/13-a very well aged bottle (3+ years at least) that looked great after the pour; 2 finger creamy beige head that faded very slowly and left incredible lacing coating the sides. The nose is very sweet, like a blend of dark fruit, syrup, rum/wine, vanilla, oaky, brown sugar, citrus hops a light booze; the sweetness jumps out, but is very complex and somehow soft and alluring. There are some many fruity notes that I won’t even attempt to describe the intricate aroma’s associated with this brew – get one, age it and experience it for yourself. Flavor is sweet and boozy, again with a massive dark fruit presence that includes cherry, red grapefruit, pear and rotting apple, syrup/molasses, rum/red wine like merlot, vanilla, oaky or smoky notes, brown sugar, citrus hops, floral hops, cinnamon and light booze like bourbon; the oak aging seems to have overtaken the hops from the DIPA blend, but the flavor is very smooth and complex, port-like in the way it forces you to sip and savor. This is mellow and hides the ABV wonderfully, with so much flavor that it’s almost like a wine at this point with mead like qualities in a good way. It’s very hard to accurately describe the flavor, but quite easy to state (again) that this is a very delicious hybrid and definitely worth seeking out"
"D: An absolutely awesome beer... you wouldn't want to pound it back all night, but it's really pretty fantastic. One of my new top favorites from DFH... and that's really saying something with their lineup."
"Draft, City Beer Store. Besides 120 min, which arguably doesn't count, this is probably the sweetest DIPA that I've tried so far. It was a nice reminder to make an appointment with the dentist but a rather underwhelming beer. The beer looks fine, golden amber with a small white head. The aroma is honey, hops and sweet malt, a warning of things to come. There's a hint of oak, which I wish was about ten times stronger. The hops are sort of a tropical fruit lifesaver note. The flavor is way too sweet with no noticeable dryness from the wood or balancing bitter hop bite. The hops come through as a candied version of themselves, which sorta works in the 120 min but falls flat here. I can deal with one or the other, but the sweetness combined with lackluster hop flavor are what killed the beer for me. Squall remains my favorite DFH IPA by a wide margin."
"D - More of a night cap for me. This puppy is to be savored, a marathon as opposed to a sprint of a session."
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, Florida. Tawny reddish orange with a ring of bubbly white head and globs of lacing on the pint glass. Smell and taste are barley, apple cider, booze soaked wood, brandy, buttery biscuits, white wine, English style hops, and oak. Luscious and creamy mouth feel is succulent, spiced, and bittersweet. Low dryness in the finish with a fruity, rum-like aftertaste. The hops produce a juicy bite, but Burton is very malty for a DIPA. An intriguing and flavourful concoction that's merely 'okay' for the style."
"D/Overall: Killer. Absolutely a world class beer as far as I'm concerned. Truly outstanding by nearly every metric. Amazing to look at, to smell, and to taste. I'll be seeking it out fanatically from now on."
"Drinking Burton Baton is not quite like George Costanza's dream of being ensconced in velvet, but I did get the sensation of a heavy fleece blanket wrapped snugly around my shoulders."
"enjoy!"
"Decided to open a single bottle of this I'd been aging to celebrate the premier of Brewmasters. After 18 months of aging, the oak emerges in force. Paired perfectly with orange peel, the vanilla character of the oak gives this an almost creamsicle character. The alcohol heat is still noticeable in the throat, but has rounded out nicely. The flavors are subdued a bit, but have melded. Wouldn't say it's improved, though. Better fresh."
"D_Its one to savour but more than one would be easy."
"D: Even though this is not my favorite style, I will continue to stock at the house when available."
"Overall- very good. resin could be toned down and more hop flavor. complex and interesting. not a good DIPA but a great beer."
"Drinkability: Way high. The 10% is surprising and minimally noticable. Its weird to compare this to other high level DIPAs, because thats not really what this is. Its is delicious though."
"This is probably one of the best I've ever had. An agressive pour gave me a thick fluffy head which slowly faded to a thin layer with nice lacing but the aromas that literally exploded out of the glass had my mouth watering. The hops hit me first, but not too hard. Almost citrusy but not quite- the bitterness of the hops quickly faded into an absolutletly wonderful malty, oakey, slightly sweet place where angels sing. Mouthfeel is wonderfully rich, coating your mouth with this fantastic flavor. As you swalloiw the rich finish makes you sigh and remember that nice hoppy introduction that just lingers nicely."
"It is a sipper, and gets even better as the temp rises to bring out more of the qualities described. Definitely a nice finisher, something to savor at the end of a night. I can easily see myself having this again. It is great."
"D: this one is smooth and balanced the abv is hidden, behind big malt and balanced out by hops, highly drinkable. this is a smooth drinker."
"D: I would love to drink one of these every now and then but its not something i would want to drink all night."
"D-definately a sipper but very drinkable for a DIPA theirs not quite as much bitterness as most which i find very satisfying but should be approached with danger due to its high abv"
"Dark amber with an off-white head that stays around and leaves good lace on the glass. Both sweet malts and piney resinous hops in the aroma. The taste is much the same - more malty than most IPAs, double or otherwise. Reminds me of 90 Minute in that respect. Nice oak notes. Good rounded body and a little alcohol kick. Very Dogfish Head, very complex."
"Overall this is another excellent DIPA from Dogfish Head and a wonderful oaked beer. Highly recommended."
"BRAVO! The Burton Baton swings and hits a grand-slam home run."
"Pours a nice orangish amber color with nice two finger head which gives way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of floral hops with some citrus fruit notes and a sweet malt backbone with hints of oak. The taste is nice strong floral hops with lemon and orange notes over a sweet malt backbone and hints of vanilla oak. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, good hide on the abv and very smooth for a double ipa."
"Gone way too fast. I miss it. I guess that means it drinks pretty well, especially considering its girth."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers I have had from Dogfish Head and one of the best DIPAs I have had. The flavor profile deviates a bit from what I would consider a standard DIPA, but it is delicious in its own right. The bottle says this ages with the best of them and I would guess that is probably true. I think I'll have to pick up a few more of these next time I see them."
"A thoroughly enjoyable brew. I would have it again and I would love to age some."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer, this one has a lot of flavor and a lot of gravity so it packs a punch but it's still good."
"M & D = God please help this beer gain distribution on the West Coast!"
"Very, very nice, glad I got a chance to try this."
"For a 10% it is quite drinkable."
"D: A must try in my opinion. Haven't had this one fresh yet but, as the bottle promises, it ages well. I would like to try a younger version AND a more mature version to see what happens to the hops and the perceived alcohol."
"This is an amazing brew, deep, crisp, balanced, and sweet. I could do this all day if not for the 10% abv. Good job."
"D: this is very drinkable, esp considering the high abv. The hops are the highlight, but they don't overwhelm. There is a nice malty character that keeps the hop in check. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall, another high quality beer from DFH. They use hops as good, if not better than any American brewery out there. I definitely recommend Dogfish Head Burton Baton to DFH fans, IPA aficionados and beer advocates alike."
"O/D: It's a good beer, the oak isn't as predominant as I'd like it to be, but the taste is satisfying. Can't decide if I want more or less of a hop bite, but something's a touch off from giving this beer a better score."
"This beer is in, or near, my top echelon for Imperial IPA, a style which I have sampled prodigiously. I would rank it with Oskar Blues’ Gordon, Sierra’s Estate (the best of all), and Bell’s HopSlam as far as the best commonly available examples of the style."
"It's something nice to try once or just for special occasions, but the price will keep it from being a frequent visitor to my fridge."
"A deep ruby copper, relatively clear with a decent light vanilla colored head and great lacing served cool in a tulip glass at the Broken Barrel in Palm Bay, FL. The aroma is a clean, bright citrus, light grapefruit and a hint of caramel bread and raisin, very nice. The flavor offers awesome tart citrus pine enveloped in fruit nougat thickness. There's a note of alcohol for sure but this is reasonably drinkable, presenting a smooth, viscous brew. Touches of licorice and caramel/vanilla, root beer, somewhat cloying. There are some herbal nuances here as well. Just a fun blend of things that combine IPA bitterness and old ale malt complexity. This could become a regular item for lts of folks, including me. It's finely carbonated for a lively but full mouthfeel. It disipates quickly on the tongue with a delightfully tart kiss, begging for more...and more."
"Overall drinkability is good--the complex taste makes me want to have another."
"Medium heavy body, taste lingers a sweet hoppyness. Incredible drinkability could drink a four pack if it wasn't so damn expensive. Hands down my favorite DfH beer!"
"Nice little sipper. I could certainly pour myself 3 or 4 of these."
"Excellent drinkability!"
"The beer pours a very rich amber in the glass and the first smell is an overwhelming Hops scent that led me to initially dread its taste, but I was surprised. The initial taste is a strong burst of heavy hoppiness typical of most IPA's but the surprise was the lingering taste in the mouth. Definite hints of citrus, pine resin, toffee and perhaps maybe even butterscotch, blend for a smoothness in the drinkability. It does have a bit of grainy feel in its texture on the tongue but is definitely an easily drinkable beer especially for someone who is not a fan of hoppy IPA's."
"Powerful and intense brew, but delicious and leaves me wanting more."
"Enjoy this one."
"D- for the most part an enjoyable blend, although DFH ipas have always been a little on the sweet side for my tastes. hops and alcohol hit hard and i'm glad i saved this one for a night cap."
"I would say the nose is the most impressive aspect here. It has a woody sweetness from the oak aging that is like nothing I've had the pleasure of sniffing. The other characteristics are not to be taken for granted either. Clear red color. Deep, sweet pine and citrus with an overlay of brown sugar. Sugary thick mouthfeel. I would like to thank the Academy for this opportunity..."
"I don't know about paying 150% of 90min IPA's price for this beer, at least not on a regular basis. That said, if you like 90min IPA, I'd say you have to spring for its more sophisticated older brother at least once."
"10% has never been so well hidden. Delicious and worth every penny."
"Overall I think this tastes even better on-tap than it did in the bottle but only by a small margin. Probably my favorite DFH beer with the possible exception of Palo Santo Marron. Well worth a shot."
"D - A sipping beer that disappears quickly, which is dangerous considering its a.b.v. A great balance for those who do not seek an intimidating IPA, but want to try something new. Not intended for a day-long drink, but it will likely end up being so!"
"All and all very identical to the 90min.A little bit of wood and that's about it. The place I bought this from charged 5.00 more that the 90 min from now on I will just by that."
"D - A solid beer, definitely an East Coast DIPA. Enjoyable (although four times out of five I'd probably reach for a 90 Minute instead)."
"While I could never sit at a bar and pound this one down, I could see myself leisurly quaffing one on a deck after a long day. A complex beer for a simple man."
"Another great DFH. I wonder how this will age...."
"Pours a nice clear copper with an off-white head. The aroma is very sweet and dominated by malt, sugar, with a hint of that oak """snap""" that you get in an oak-aged ale. The sweetness hits your tongue immediately upon tasting, but this beer is not yet finished; it is quite complex. You get a slight alcoholic aftertaste mixed with some hops and darker, more woody flavors. This is definitely an IPA even though the oak adds a whole new apect to it."
"Amber copper pour with decent head and lacing. Strong dark fruit and candy nose with lots of malt. Very chewy and resiny. Extremely syrupy and a bit too sweet for my taste. The dark fruit flavor overpowers the hop bitterness which was subdued to say the least. The sweetness kills the drinkability for me. Pretty disappointing for Dogfish Head. I'll give it another try considering the great reviews I've seen for this. Maybe an old bottle."
"Probably as drinkable as a 10% DIPA can be. An unexpectedly pleasant drinking experience, but not sure I'd want another one right now."
"Overall, this is a good beer that is very drinkable. It is hard to believe the ABV because it is so easy to drink. In fact, that makes me a little cautious. A sweeter version of the double IPA."
"D: I really thought about a 5 on this one. This is definitely one of my favorite DIPAs to date and I'm glad I finally took the time to review it. I only bought 2 and am working on my second one now. When I grab more, if I can go through all 4 in a sitting and not be outside talking to woodland creatures I'll be sure to change this to a 5!"
"D - This stuff is yummy. That is all I can say."
"Taste is sweet and malty like the aroma, the woody oak characteristic is pretty evident, lots of caramel, not much for hops or bitterness, definitely a sweeter DIPA (at least an aged version), for 10% I can make out any heat or strength at all and could easily pound these down until it knocks me off my ass."
" Overall an outstanding offering, big character, and nicely balanced. A must try-Get some!!"
"D: Very easy to drink. Leaves a nice warm feeling. Unfortunately, this beer has been somewhat hard to find in my area, but I am sure to purchase it whenever I have the opportunity"
"Dark orange, amber in body topped by white head. Great aroma of hops, grass, tiny lil citrus note, wood, pine. Amazingly smooth! Malty, hoppy, a bit of bourbon toward the finish. Whiskey aftertaste persists but gets wiped clean by the next sip. Medium-thick in body and highly drinkable. Much more drinkable and taste friendly than I had expected. Two thumbs way up!"
"D: A very intense beer. The first time I had it, it felt very sweet and rich. Subsequent bottles were easier to adjust to, and they revealed substantial complexity and craft in the brew. Despite a small downgrade since my last review, I still love this beer. It's really not a DIPA though."
"- to drink! It tastes great, and isn't too sticky and harsh... for an alcohol bomb, it is pleasant, and well crafted."
"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer. I enjoy it though, and think it works quite well as a barleywine at this point."
"Amazing all around beer, one of my favorites!"
"hare krishna!"
"D- I rated this one high for drinkability, or at least higher than I originally planned to. This went down quite well but I will not be having another one in session. The abv% alone makes me a little wary, but its pungency creates an experience I feel is best enjoyed as a bottle et solus but maybe a good one to start/end the evening"
"Overall, one of the better higher alcohol biers I have tasted. Usually, I am not a big fan of them, but this one is tolerable and one that I would have again. Enjoy. Prosit."
"Smell was close to getting one score higher. Surprised by this one, very unique. Not that it's surprising coming from DFH. Complex aroma and taste, very woody with lots of oak and vanilla showing and even a tad of brandy in there. The hops show a little bitter fruit and hop resin with a leathery character. Mouthfeel is silky, creamy and slightly chewy with outstanding carbonation. Nice heavy feel and great complex flavors. Outstanding."
"D: Very Boozy feel But if you like Palo Santo Then this is right up there with it the whole earthy feel to it, very good beer this is why i love Dogfish Head Beers."
"Poured a deep ruby red amber with a small head, a little lace that faded into a nice coating with eddys and swirls embedded in the bubbly lace, lingered to the last drop. Smell was sweet, very very sweet. Candy apple, caramle, cherry were all over this and predominated. Slight hop back detected and a tiny bit of alcohol. The taste followed the same route with the huge candy sweetness predominating some other hints of apple, cherries, grapes. Some alcohol, but it is mostly balanced by the robust flavors. Goes down very smooth, light and crisp. Tingles and warms as it goes. Carbonation is not overly done though. Overall this is a very nice brew, a little too sweet"
"I liked this one. I've had it before and always enjoyed it. It paired nicely with the grilled chicken fajitas with Monterrey Jack cheese I had. The bitter hops balanced and complimented the cheese. With a 10% ABV, take it slow, but enjoy and have another!"
"D - 10%???? Damn, good thing this only came in singles."
"D- Easy...too easy for the ABV but this is a great beer"
"Overall, while a good beer, I'm not sure I'm quite sold on the idea of an aged DIPA. Even though I understand they blend fresh 90 minute with the aged version I really feel like it's already lost it's identity as a DIPA at only four months old."
"Other- Probably my favorite IPA. I am very mad I only bought a single bottle, I cannot find it anywhere now!"
"This might be my favorite offering from Dogfish Head: a little crazy, but I got what I expected & more. I've had a difficult time with other Oaked Imperial IPAs, but this one really did it for me. One is satisfying, I don't think I could drink this baby all evening."
"The concept of bourbon barrel aging an IPA is interesting. On one hand it seems very appealing to blend these two flavors but on the other the bourbon could be too prominent, overtaking the flavor of the hops. Fortunately this beer falls into the latter category. This beer still contains a very bitter hop forward flavor with a decent amount of citrus peel and grapefruit as well as some dry piny notes. This is balanced by a sweet bourbon alcohol warmth with some earthy oak and subtle vanilla flavor."
"It's a good beer, that's for sure. Drinkability was ok. Only had one nonetheless, and I probably wouldn't try it again. As good as this beer is, I can think of dozens of better DIPA's."
"This beer will sneak up on you and hit you over the head be careful"
"Poured from bottle into Unibroue tulip. Bottle is 3.5 months old. Amazing aroma of fresh hops and sweet aged malts combined into one of the best smelling beers on earth. When other people drink this beer, I ask them if I can have the bottle after its empty so I can smell it from time to time to motivate me, knowing I can drink one at the end of the night. For a special treat, you can leave one ounce of beer in the bottle and put it in your car in the hot sun for a few hours. Makes a great air freshener...seriously. Love it at any age, fresh or old, love it warm, love it cold. Basically a combination of my favorite two styles...double IPA and aged strong ale. In my opinion, Burton is one of the best beers ever made, maybe THE best."
"Very nice beer. Impressed actually. Purchased a week before I could drink it (didnt want to ruin the flavor with the cold). Much better than any other oaked IPA I've ever had. Another nice DFH brew"
"D - Very heavy and high alcohol. Not a good beer to have more than one."
"Body and drinkability are what is expected from the style, except that the sweetness may put some people off. Overall, a very good beer that I'll have again and certainly worth trying."
"Full article: http://timdudley.net/beer/?p=49"
"Served on draught at Dogfish head pub in Gaithersburg, MD. Beer is red, darkish, clear, tight head, white, two fingers, hops in aroma along with alcohol. Interesting flavor, high malt, lots of alcohol, bitterness not as much as I expected. Drinkability high, Low carbonation and lacing left on the glass. This was a pleasantly surprising beer. It smelled like and IPA and tasted like a strong ale. It was incredible. Find it."
"D: This is a great beer from Dogfish Head, but a still prefer the 90 minute to this. The oak aging adds some great character, but the overall sweetness limits the drinkability of this one."
"Tasted remarkably similar to DFH 90 minute to me at first taste when coming out of a refridgerator. As I gave it some time to warm up, I could definitely taste a more pronounced oaked flavor. I would recommend to everybody trying this beer to give it some time to warm up to let some of the complexities warm up. Beer can be shy at first. While I cannot complain that it tastes very similar to DFH 90, since I really enjoy their 90 minute, I was slightly let down at first and then as time went, Burton Baton opened up and I had decided that this beer was worth having more than one of. Worth $4 a beer ? sometimes"
"D- Very drinkable and dangerously addictive if you have love for the 90 minute ipa... but want more. This is it... the one and only 100 minute IPA. Thats what I think. Will buy as much as I can find."
"The beer poured a deep, clear amber, with a thin almond head into a chalice. A big hop aroma - piney, citrusy, heavenly! An astonishingly clean and crisp hop flavor, with alcoholic esters and malt in the background, finishing off with a very smooth hop bitterness - a really fantastic I2PA. Nice thick mouthfeel, with heavy lacing all the way down the glass. All in all a great beer. It has everything you want in a big-time IPA: crisp hop aroma, smooth hop flavor and bitterness, alcohol and malt presence, and did I mention hops, hops, and more hops?"
"D - Very drinkable though the flavor is a little intense towards the end. Highly recommended."
"There's nothing sweet, floral, or citric about Burton Baton. This is leather, dark wood, and musk. This is the closest thing, from a bottle, I've ever had to """real""" ale."
"NOTES: The Foodery in Philadelphia, PA"
"Drinkability: A sipper. If the alcohol was less noticeable in the taste, I'd give it a higher rating. I liked the taste, but not enough to make me want more. I'm going to age a bottle and see if that helps."
"Notes: A very nice twist to the DIPA. The vanilla oaky range of subtleties give it a very enjoyable depth."
"Drinkability: For being a 10% beer it goes down smooth and easy and is very drinkable. Each sip leaves you thirsty for more."
"Medium bodied brew with nice cleansing carbonation. The finish is dry flavor wise but sticky."
"Wow. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. But I'm always up for surprises. Very good brew. Be patient and put a few away for a few years. You'll be glad you did."
"Drink-ability: Definitely one of my favorites by dogfish head, may even have an easier drink-ability than the 90 since the oak subdues the bitterness. Surprising that it is 10% abv considering the typical high abv 'bite' isn't present."
"Poured reddish orange with a moderate head that quickly faded. The aroma is citrus, grapefruit mostly. After reading a few BA's wish that they could compare Burton Baton and 90 Minute side by side, I decided to do just that. And it was a pleasure. The main difference in taste was the sweetness in Burton, 90 is sweetish, but not so much. I also got more grapefruit from Burton and more orange from 90 Minute, but the difference was not huge. Both had a little aftertaste bite. 90 was crisper. Burton was medium bodied and oily. Drinkability? I liked it a lot, but this is a 10.0 ABV, better drink it at home. Bottom line: I like them both, but 90 Minute slightly better. BTW, my 100th review and I had a choice between Burton Baton and J.W. Lees Harvest Lagavulin 2007, but with the 90 Minute kicker, DFH won."
"O: one of the better dfh beers, a little sweet but drier than other dfh's, which i like, much better than the 90 minute"
"D: Extreamly drinkable, the high ABV is not apparent. It's a perfectly balanced and weighted beer. I haunted the store in March waiting for the release. I hope to cellar a bit for the ski season. It's rich enough for a winter warmup and clean enough to be refreshing after a day in the snow."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams Sensory glass. The pour produced a dark orange color with a minimal 1 finger head. I could pick up citrus, pine, and wood notes. The initial taste comprised of grapefruit and then switched to a vanilla, syrupy taste on the way down. The booze and the syrup distract from an otherwise nice take on the style. For the cost I find it hard to get a lot of these but I wouldn't mind revisiting it from time to time."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, no hint of alcohol, balance makes it very smooth and crisp on the finish that keeps you coming back for more. This is an outstanding beer, would love to see what its like in 6 months! Will be picking up lots of this one!"
"A decently drinkable non-West Coast DIPA, and I appreciate what Dogfish Head is trying to do with the oak; however, it's nothing special. If presented the choice between the two, I would much rather reach for a 90 Minute DIPA, as there is more balance between the hops and malts without the obtrusiveness that the oak exhibits."
"The alcohol comes through in the back end (10% ABV) with the malty character of the beer. Medium body, but very complex. Medium carbonation, but creamy on the back end."
"D: You get enough of the 90 to make you long for it. This is a mellower, smoother DIPA. Depending on your mood, that could be a good thing or a bad thing. I liked it, but thought the oak effect was a bit overstated."
"solid stuff"
"D - It's a bit much to go down too easy but it is not bad."
"Very drinkable for a high ABV. Great flavors that create a wonderfully complex imperial oaked IPA. This is what you expect DFH to produce, another awesome creative craft brew."
"D: Another extremely enjoyable DFH brew and one I'm glad I finally got take try. Though not quite on par with 90 minute, I like the unique oak flavors that this one offers. DFH definitely does some well crafted (balance!), creative brews and this is one of them. Very recommended and a brew you should try if you come across it."
"D: Very drinkable for the high abv. Wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting, but would love to pair this with a spicy meal."
"The color is a couple shades darker than some IPA's with a decent amount of head and nice sticky lacing. Most immediate smell is molasses, followed by plenty of hops and oak. Smaller notes of vanilla and a tinge of Bourbon. Some good 3C bittering hops in the taste, high alpha acids. Has some sweetness to it. Nice oak flavor but hops do dominate. Hops and oak, it's like peanut butter and chocolate, """Two great tastes, that go great together""". Lingering bitterness from hops and some oak coat the inside of the mouth. A touch sticky feeling. Good drinkability, disappears too fast."
"Drinkability: This is an intense, complex beer that is full of rich and subtle flavors and I liked it a lot. With this ABV it is a one a night beer but it is well worth buying and trying. I'll certainly be having more of this beer as a special treat when I want something out of the ordinary and first rate."
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty and unique brew...and that is one thing I have come to love and expect from DFH. That being said, I do feel that it's uniqueness and overall complex flavor makes a great beer to have just one or two of, but not pound throughout the night. An absolutely perfect way to relax on a Friday night."
"The beer has a naturally big, soft, foamy head that lingers. Nice copper coloring. The aroma is tropical fruit (pineapple), dark sugar, honey, and maybe some orange. The flavor is BIG and soft. Nice caramel malt body with warm sweetbread notes. It has the big hop profile that I've come to expect whenever DFH does an IPA, and they do them about as well as anyone. The bitterness is just right, and doesn't overpower the malt. The oak barrel aging does a nice job of smoothing everything out and adding a somewhat chardonnay-like oaky note. It really speaks to the level of effort and devotion that DFH puts into its beers that it can continually push our limits to review them. This is a very special beer, to be shared only with loved ones... and kept away from the unbelievers. Or so they say."
"D - This is one heck of a beer, with a weight & intensity not altogether apparent until nearly half gone. I've been a fan of DFH for years. Burton Baton is one of their better ones, in my opinion. Very tasty & complex, I would have few reservations recommending this beer. My only gripe is that, while I would like to drink them all night, one at a time is sufficient for me."
"An interesting take on DFH's DIPA. Glad it didn't come in a 4 pack, as it's quite similar to the 90 mins I already have."
"Pours an orange/ruby color, with a bit of red mixed in. Slight head of of off-white bubbles. It has a slightly earthy, yeast small. Burton Baton has a strong taste; lots of alcohol, a bit of earthy spice, and something I always classify as a musty flavor. It tastes old, but that's not bad. It has a slightly lower and medium body and a bit above average carbonation. Interesting. I wouldn't drink a bunch of these, but 12 or 24 ounces would be just right."
"Truth be told, I like the hops in the 90 better, but that's just my taste. The barrels ad a whole other level of complexity to this one that's undeniably good. This beer has a nice malt character that takes the DFH IPA in a new direction. A joy to drink."
"341 ml bottle courtesy of HogtownHarry. Deep and hazy mahogany. Pours a frothy beige cap. Leaves some pretty lace. Nose is toffee and caramel, peaches and orange. Some woody earthy hops too. Tastes of caramel, vanilla, lots of oak, quite fruity too. Flavours of brown sugar are huge. The hops don't play as much as a role as I thought they would, and overall this is a lot sweeter than I expected. The finish does show earthy caramel malts with fresh hop bitterness. Long finish. Reminds of of a sweeter version of 90 minute, or what I'd expect 90 minute to taste like blended with a Fuller's Vintage Ale. Thanks for the bottle Harry!"
"DFH continues to amaze me! Their innovation is second to none, and this brew is no exception. Looking forward to Black & Blue and Red & White."
"Pours out a rather yellow-redish color with a thin white head. Good lacing all the way dawn. Smells of strong green hops, with some wood notes as well. The taste has a nice wide hop bite up front, but as I swirl it over my tounge the roasted malt flavors come out real fast. Rather supprising for an IIPA. This has alot of sweet flavors on the back of the tounge. The mouthfeel is rather tangy, but it's not really from the carbonation. This really would be a good """gate-way""" beer for those not too familar with hoppy IIPA's."
"This is a very nice beer, drank at 52 (+/-) degrees F."
"I think this is actually better than the 90 minute IPA and would get this, much less available beer, any time I can find it. Dogfish has a number of more obscure beers that are really good and this is definitely one of them. I'd also include Raison d'extra, world wide stout and some of their more experimental beers. Always check the dogfish head section whenever you go to a good beer store."
"poured into a tulip it took a violent pour to release even a finger's worth of head which quickly disappeared and left little lacing and sat atop a sexy amber brew with ruby hues. smells of hops, fresh and zesty with bits of pear, wood, and hints of grape. upon tasting, wow. hops followed by hops and hops, but in a mellowed, balanced way so even a non-hophead might find great pleasure upon consuming. slight oak comes through. feels good in the mouth, thick but not chewy. the biggest problem with this libation is that i can't put it down, and at 10%, it could be dangerous."
"Drinkability: Honestly, I consider most any beer highly drinkable if it's a style I enjoy. Burton Baton is quite dangerous, as the high ABV is disguised by a truly excellent mouthfeel that allows you to take one swig after another. A great beer from a brewery I would expect to make a high-end DIPA."
"Pours a syrupy looking ambrosia amber color. No head or bubbling. But a great looking IPA still. The aroma is up front, woodsy and fruity nectar sweet. The aged away hops give this DIPA a nice caramelized orange peel aroma and oohhh yeah...alcohol. Sweet are caramelized fruits and alcoholic warmth start the flavor profile off. The middle has a more subdued alcohol and toasted wood mixig with the still strong fruit flavors. Apple and pear brandy come to mind with all these rich, syrupy palated fruit flavors jumping all over the palate. The is a strong, alcoholic, and syrupy beer. This a noteworthy, complex sipper. Koodos Dogfish!!!"
"Man, I had high expectations for this one. A very complex crazy brew, but what a let down. I'm a staunch defender of DFH, but dammit sometimes they just try too hard."
"overall a very nicely made IPA that reminds me of a barley wine."
"I found one more a couple months later and I stick to my previous comments - it's strong, deep, malty and boozey and just not what I like."
"Drinkability: Well alcohols too high for a session. But this a seductive brew that is complex. You could sip on two of these and enjoy yourself and feel great afterwords. A definite joy to drink price is a bit high though."
"D: Given the abv and the fairly well concealed abv, this is a very dangerously drinkable brew."
"This is a fine imperial IPA. Very complex flavors, yet very balanced and drinkable. The alcohol is nicely masked in this one. Very good brew."
"Pours to a nice head that is holding. Has a nice amber color. The oak and hop can not be missed in the aroma, and carries over to the taste just as well. There is also a big body with a nice sweet undertone. I am noticing the flavors are melding much better as it gets warmer. As far as drinkability this is something to appreciate at a very moderate pace. The fact this is 10% is very well masked by the big flavor. All in all this is a fine offering once again by Dogfish Head. I think for any DIPA drinker they will enjoy this very much."
"Pours deep clear copper with huge fluffy head and streamers of carbonation. The aroma is floral hop, deep and rich. Flavor is rich caramel with a vast blast of floral hops. Plummy, malty toffelike finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick. The high alcohol content is masked by the malt, good balance."
"Drinkability: the initial drinkability of this brew was 3.5 but this brew is definitely growing on me and has bumped itself up to a 4.0."
"CHEERS!!"
"Poured a golden amber, with a nice thick head. Lacing remained far where the head started after it subsided. I smelled citrus, oak, and a hint of malt. Mouthfeel had a nice residue to it, this beer stayed on my palette for a bit, and its what I have come to expect from an Imperial IPA. Unlike some doubles there is a much stronger malty backbone, which I prefer as it increases the complexity of the taste. Hop citrus taste up front, with a hint of Oak throughout with a nice resiny smooth finish of malt. Nice and complex. Drink ability is up there but it is not something I would slam. This beer is to be savored. Very few Imperial IPA are better."
"Aged one year. The nose lost a lot of the hops, leaving a caramelly, fruity, warm aroma. I prefer the aroma fresh, but the taste has improved over time. There is less complexity than the fresh version, but the simplicity works. It became sweeter, with dark fruits, caramel, and buttersotch flavors backed up by subtle oak. There is a touch of the 90 minute hop flavors in the back, but bitterness has subsided."
"D: DFH does it again. It was skeptical of how an oak-aged strong ale would fit with 90M, but this really is two great tastes that taste great together. I can't put it above 90M, but it's good for a change of pace."
"The taste is so smooth, it tastes like there is zero carbonation in this beer. The lack of carbonation shows how prevalent the malt backing is here. Tons of caramel and 2 row. On the end, hints of lemon, an astringent bitterness, mixed with minimal oak and alcohol. As bad as that last sentence sounds, it works for me. Thanks Sam."
"Verdict: I went in expecting something interesting and satisfying, and that's exactly what I ended up with. While this isn't a big hop-bomb (neither is their 90 Minute), Dogfish Head have crafted a tasty and complex brew here."
"D: Excellent beer with an excellent scent, complex flavors and overall innovative approach"
"Overall: I love this beer. This is a beer lovers beer. This is a DIPA for those who love IPA's and for those who dislike them. This beer will challenge your idea of what an IPA is (Much the the 90Min does) and change your opinion. Mmm Mmm, Dogfish Head, this is such an awesome beer. I will buy more."
"M/D: Sticky malts and abundant smooth and flavorful hops combined with the oak character make this a beer with some great and interesting complexities. A great texture means that this is a great one to go back for more on!"
"D: Meh, I was hoping for a little bit more of a hop bomb, and this comes up a bit short. Really more of a barleywine if you ask me. Still a tasty beer, and I may seek it out again and try aging it a bit more to see this progress into more of a barleywine. Good beer, but not something to look to for a hop fix."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled on 03/30/09 indicated on the label. Poured a translucent amber with a one inch, frothy, off-white head that sizzled and popped below the cap before it eventually settled in a consistent quarter inch of foam. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution. Creamy clumps of lacing congealed as the brew receded. Nose was resinous, with caramel, a hint of grapefruit and some light oak qualities. Wood comes out in the taste, but lacking some of the big malty, grapefruit character of a typical DIPA. Exceptional balance - wood nicely blends with the other flavors without kicking you in the teeth (like oak-aged Unearthly does); some resinous hops comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly effervescent - not really oily or viscous like some DIPAs. Good drinkability with a well-hidden abv at 10%. A nice, slightly more complex alternative to 90 Minute."
"The hops aroma is evident the second I popped the cap. Pours a light amber color. Burton Baton has the familiar taste you'd expect from an IPA. At first, the oak flavor is quite subtle, but becomes more prominent after a while. It's surprisingly light and has a noticeable, but not overpowering bite. You'd never guess the ABV is nearly as high as it truly is. Great beer. I'd certainly buy it again!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a tight dense khaki colored head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is of piney, grapefruit hops, asprin, and a bready honey malt. The taste starts off sweet, some honey, oranges, mangos and sugar. This is followed by a piney, resiny bitter hop blast. Light asprin characteristics in the end. Typical DIPA. Moderate to full feel, semi-tingly carbonation leads to a smoothish feel. The sweetness is high but is offset by the bitter hops, none seem to dominate. Alcohol is well hidden on this one. A real nice DIPA, good offsetting flavors with hidden ABV make this very drinkable."
"Another winner from Dogfish. This is a lot like a cross between the 90 and the 120 minute IPAs. The hop presence seems a little stronger than in the 90 but the alcohol is toned way down from the 120. The oak aging comes through a bit with a slight vanilla flavor, but overall it's not too noticeable. Nevertheless, this is a good beer that works quite nicely as a nightcap. Recommended."
"Drinks very well at 10%, there is a small boozey quality to the taste, but it adds to the flavor. Almost want to call this Bourbon Baton, and it's delicious."
"Pours out a beautiful clear copper, with kind of a small head, but very dense, which leaves a bit of lacing. Very pretty looking. There's a bit of earthy hops, with some spicy and fruity notes - primarily tropical fruits, but a strong syrupy presence is most notable. A bit estery with a lot of toasty malts, and a bit of wood as well. I can imagine it smelling much worse, but it doesn't smell like a DIPA (then again, I guess it really isn't a DIPA - only half of one), there's nothing harsh, but I'd love to smell more hops. In the taste, the old ale sort of dominates, like a hoppy old ale. Low bitterness, a bit of oak cask flavors. Some kind of roasty, not quite bready, but crackery malt tastes come through well. I can really taste the yeast in this in some respects - something reminds me of raw yeast, like the little vials. But when you get to the hoppiness, this one really shines. It's not piney, or bitter, or resinous at all - there's a wonderful tropical fruitiness to this, like mangoes, maybe a bit of tart cherry, and a nice kick of lemon-lime in the end. The alcohol is actually barely even noticeable. The feeling is still a bit syrupy, maybe its the kind of low level of carbonation. I can also notice the esters quite well because of that. The yeasty flavor kind of throws it off for me, but still I like this much better than the 90min. This one tasted pretty much how I exptected to. Though I hadn't noticed the alcohol as I was drinking it, I can imagine that I'll feel it soon. I think the smaller pour was just about right for this."
"D= This is a big mother of an ale, and very deserving of the title DIPA. Though I don't know if I would want more than one or maybe two in a sitting, I was impressed with the way this beer hid its strength. Could be interesting if aged for 6-12 months..."
"I've been searching for this one for quite some time, it never seems to show up. I am impressed, I definitely like it better than the regular 90 Minute."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. very pricey though."
"Hops aren't too bitter which is nice. The barrel aging gives this a really nice taste in the finish. Mouthfeel is really smooth. I'm scoring drinkability on a curve given the alcohol content."
"...still IMO best oak aged DIPA/IPA is Southern Tiers Oak Aged Unearthly...this one is in 2nd"
"Thanks to GbVDave for this one. 12oz brown bottle. Bottled on 3/20/09. Served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a bright gold/amber with a finger of off white head. Piny/citrusy hop aroma with a little alcohol, also a bit of oak. This started off with a good malt base. Not as much hop bitterness as the aroma might suggest. In the flavor, the oak is pretty subtle, mostly in the finish. Solid medium body. Good beer, nice balance."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable in my opinion, though it might not be a good idea to have more than a couple of these in one sitting. I'll definitely be getting some more of this sometime soon. Surprised it's taken me this long to try it."
"D: It's a strong beer with tons of flavor. I really enjoyed one, but I doubt I'd want another one immediately after."
"Probably could have another one but not too many in any one session."
"D - Although I didn't dislike this beer, I'm not sure that the oak aged English strong ale adds much to the already phenomenol 90 Min IPA. The major complaint is too much alcohol in the taste. There's a lot of flavor to sort of mask it, but it's still out in the open. Some age might help this guy; as it is I can't really pinpoint the effect of the addition of English strong ale aside from a general watering down of hop flavor and a big boozy blast on the back end."
"Full mouthfeel and mildly carbonated. This beer is so """Healthy""" I just want to get down and wallow in it..Absolutely delicious!! I want more!"
"Served: in a tulip glass."
"Pours a very clear amber with an extremly perfect light brown head. The head last a good while and takes time to crumple down. Lace from the beer sticks around forever if you let it. The lace cirlces its way dwon from the top to the bottm and looks great. The aroma is refreshing and very welcoming. Oak takes the lead in the smells coming from the beer with the malt right behind it and citrus hops in the back ground. The taste is something revolutionary for me as the Oak, Malt, and hops are perfectly balanced. Nothing in the taste out did each other, the Oak and malt I felt were balanced on the same level with the hops just behind it a bit. Carbonation levels were great and helped the aroma and flavors out extremly! This beer's 10% is hardly noticed and for a beer at this calibur it is always welcomed. Will always stock this when available in my area or travels. Recomend to anyone and people who enjoyed oaked Unearlthly but felt it was missing something. This beer fixes that and more! Enjoy!"
"Yet another homerun for Dogfish Head, in my book."
"I have to say, this is one fine beer. If you're a fan of the style, you won't be disappointed."
"Very good beer overall. I havent had alot of Oak Aged IPAs, but this is probably the best one I have had. Complex and tasty. A little expensive, but worth the cash."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Drinkable, but one is definitely enough in a session due to ABV."
"Very complex beer, worked for me. The like the idea of an DIPA mixed with an oaked age beer. Very good, a great beer to have every once in a while."
"I only finally got to try tBurton this year (the march 2009 release) and it has become by far one of my favorite DFH beers... I enjoyed the bottle pour a bit more than on tap, even, (this may have just been because I was eating while having it on tap).. and after drinking 4 bottles I've realized mre and more how much I like it (a practice I think more BA's should attempt, rather than reviewing a beer after one bottle).. The color is very similar to 90 minute, an amberish, deep copper hue with off-white head.. It's actually got a really beautiful deep red/amber. Simply perfect. the smell is very hoppy but also has a sweetness that is present right behind the hop and is almost the same strength, really showcasing what you'll find in the flavor. The oak presence provides a really nice base. The hop and sweeness in the flavor are balanced perfectly, with a creamy mouthfeel, its like cream soda mixed with hops (which sounds gross, but the beer is amazing).. Its basically exactly what you should expect from what it is- take 90 minute IPA and added maple syrup to it and oak age it.. Amazing."
"All in all, Really wonderful stuff! THANKS SAM!"
"D - Definitely a sipper, but I'm surprised by this one from DFH. Aging an IPA never really made much sense to me, but this one has turned out well. Nice flavor balance with a good deal of complexity."
"Pours a medium copper color with an inch of slightly off-white head that dissipates in to a fine ring around the glass. Aroma has sweet malts, slight oak and a touch of booze. Flavors include caramel malt, raisins, a bit of oak flavor and the alcohol has a warming sensation and even more so as it warms up. It has a chewy medium body. This is a nice IPA although for the money I'd say there are other options that I'd rather go with."
"While I found this beer interesting and almost enjoyable it's not very DRINKABLE. Next time I'll split it with someone."
"Another great DFH beer."
"Beer is a nice coppery amber with a thick white head. Smells of sweet citrus and malt, I also pick up some subtle more winey aromas. Taste is very complex. Bitterness is smooth with a lot of alcohol and vanilla notes from the oak. Very noticeable alcohol flavor, a little too much for me. I also keep getting hints of dried fruit flavors. Really having a hard time tasting any hop flavor, even though the bitterness is definitely there. Lots of bitterness after swallowing and I can feel the alcohol warmth as it goes down. Medium body, but pretty substantial for an IPA. This is definitely a sipping beer."
"D - It's a shame I had a ton of work to do the next day. I could have put away 2 more than I did. I'd have been hurting, for sure."
"A big beer for sure, and interesting, but big + interesting don't automatically equal greatness. I would love to see a more substantial dose of hops in this one (it is supposed to be a DIPA, after all). Powerfully malty, with plentiful oak, sweet vanilla, fruitiness, booziness and floral notes. Potential to be something special, but needs a serious spike of bitterness (or a new style designation). Pretty much a sugar bomb, just can't get into this at all."
"Drinkability: Sipper most definitely - I really enjoyed this beer. I look forward to getting more of it when I travel out of state!"
"Overall, if not for the taste (for most people the most important aspect of the 'tasting' experience) this beer would exceptional."
"I'm not sure how I feel about this beer. Dogfish occasionally wins big (the incredible Palo Santo) and loses big (Festina Peche), but this seems somewhere in the middle. It's a bit like the 120 Minute in that I appreciate what they were trying to do and it's a beer that will certainly delight many beer drinkers. It's not quite my style. I like it, but I wouldn't get a fourzie of this again."
"D: You know this is a big beer when you start to sip on it. However, you're left wanting more at the end. Fantastic beer."
"D - overly drinkable, very smooth"
"Drinkability is very good. I could happily drink a couple of these 12 ozers but with the ABV I would take my time."
"D - The more I drink, the more the oak pushes forward into the flavor. Very nice. Alcohol is definitely present, but doesn't seem like the 10% stated on the bottle. Fairly drinkable for a beer of this alcohol level, but I think one is enough for me in a session. Time to move on to something else."
"This is a hit from DFH in my book. I hope to come by some more of these before they're gone."
"D: While I enjoyed this beer and found it both pleasant and pleasurable, I'm going to have the same opinion I did with the 120 minute: It's a great beer to experience, but not necessarily one I'll be purchasing again anytime soon."
"D - With the high alcohol and how apparent it is in the taste I drank it slowly, but it was still very drinkable."
"D: Whenever I have a 90 min. or Palo Santo, I want another; the BB leaves me perfectly content after one. So in that sense, it's not very drinkable. But from first sip to last it's an engaging, enjoyable process."
"D. One of the more balance DIPA's I have had. Although since it is a mixture I guess that is to be expected. High ABV was hidden nicely."
"Pours amber witha fluffy off-white head. Good lacing down the glass. Grapefruit and woody/grassy hop flavor, very mellow, smooth hop flavor. There are also sweet malt and alcohol flavors. A nice bitterness in the finish, not too strong. It is very delicious. My only complaint is that it is a little on the thick and heavy side."
"Drinkability: A sipper, and a solid DIPA. The background sweetness becomes a little cloying after awhile, but this is a characteristic I've found in almost all of Dogfish Head's beers. Can't say I'd want more than one, and I probably wouldn't actively seek it out again."
"I'd like to sit on a few of these for a while and see how the oak mellows out with a year or two on it. It's very good even with the oak but it'd be damn near perfect if that taste in the back end for the last few sips was gone. I'd definitely go for this again."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for a beer of this strength, though still not a very sessionable beer."
"Attractive one finger plus of solid micro-froth, good stickiness and lacing, slow to dissolve. Orange-brown amber in color, noticeably clean and transparent, picture perfect visually. In the nose the juicy pink grapefruit to tangerine citrus gets run down by the caramel, vanilla oak elements, this creaminess also seems to buttress buttery malts and a mix of apricot, cherry, pineapple and date fruit scents, as it warms more pine and molasses comes out. Full-bodied, fluffy carbonation makes it expand rapidly in the mouth, almost overfilled. Very sticky texture in the mouth too, halfway through the glass your mouth pores feel clogged. That said, the momentum in the sweet grapefruit, lime, tangerine citrus as well as the pine sap keeps up the pace. More hoppy here with flowers and wet straw, the oak caramel, molasses tend to blend into the alcoholic whomp. Balanced like a bull in the ring, charges, snorts, charges again. More enjoyable chilled than closer to room temperature."
"I will have this again on occasion when it comes around."
"D=good, I could enjoy several of these before calling it quits."
"Final thoughts: It's a notch above the 90 minute IPA, which is already a fine product, both in complexity and drinkability, mostly because the oak helps to balance out the malty sweetness."
"Copper orange color with definite IPA-like smell of hops, grapefruit, and pine. Maybe a little more of the wooden character than the typical IPA as well. Taste is a nice mixture of hops, grapefruit, alcohol, and oak. The oak comes out very well in this.. adding another layer of complexity to a DIPA. Not overly strong. This is a great beer."
"Bottle reads """oak aged Imperial IPA"""... wow, can't wait to taste that one, two of my favorite tastes... wood-sy and bitter. Pours a light brown color with a big head to it and tons of lacing. Smell reminds me of a forest with the usual hoppy aromas. Taste is a lot like the 90 minute but with the oak kick in there (what else would you expect?). Has a bit of a strong alcohol taste (well, it is 10% ABV) but it's wicked smooth and absolutely delicious. Very well balanced and drinkable. Maybe a tad under Palo Santo Marrone for my fav DFH beer but damn I love that a brewery can make something as good as this."
"Oh dear god.... This was recommended to me, as I was drinking a Hop Sun, and man, did it blow me away. the hops is balanced by a sweet, almost honey flavor. You can hardly taste the 10% at first, but it does warm you from the inside as you work your way down the beer. Great beer."
"Drinkability: Moderate - easier to drink than I thought it would be for the style and ABV. I could definitely have another."
"D: only takes a hit because of the abv and you can taste a bit of the booze in it...the flavor is great and keeps me wanting more though"
"A very unique and well done brew by DFH."
"Orange-amber in color and still full of carbonation (bottle actually bubbled over upon opening), with a big, pillowy beige head. Aroma of vanilla, toasted oak, and caramel, with hops in the background. Hops have faded into the background, replaced by vanilla, bourbon, caramel, and molasses. Mellow, but still bold and sticky-sweet. This aged very, very well and is a very different experience than the first bottle. I gave away my fourth bottle, so this is my last review for this batch. It's lost a little bit from the original, so I'll rate the aged bottle 4.5/4.5/4.5/5.0/5.0."
"Verdict: My 10% ABV DIPA kicks the shit out of this beer, but that's probably because DFH gave up on the hops too soon."
"Has a caramel cream flavor, with a bit of toastedness toward the end, and a heavy hop component, but not a """punch""" or """burst""" of hoppiness. Warm oak and toast throughout, but especially on the finish. Some slight alcohol burn... not distracting, and very well drinkable for an IIPA. Maybe a bit too sweet overall."
"I like the complexity of this beer as it warms up. I don't think I let it warm up the last time I had it and it tasted like I was drinking 90 minute IPA. I like the complexity and interesting undertones in this beer, however I am very aware that 90 minute IPA is the base of this beer and dominates most of the flavor components within."
"It's fairly strong, which gives you a really warm feeling. Strongly recommended!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability, this is a very good beer, but I think there is a little room to improve on a wood aged IPA. I applaud the experimentation involved here and with DFH in general, because I know that while I may not always like the end result, Sam and co are doing some crazy shit that you don't see too much of."
" overall a wonderful DIPA, perfectly balanced and complex."
"For a 10% ABV beer, this is incredibly drinkable. Well balanced, at turns aggressive and subtle ... just downright delicious."
"D-Pretty drinkable indeed. But that alcohol sting really turns me off. But it's not bad."
"This one did not work for me and is one of the sweetest beers I have ever had. Should have picked up an Indian Brown instead."
"Drinkability: Moderate. For me, this is a beer that I would prefer to sit down and just nurse it for a while as opposed to trying to get through a few. The ABV is pretty big and I would definitely be feeling it if I attempted more than one. A very good beer overall."
"D: A little too sweet and alcoholic to drink too much of, but I am very, very excited that this release has come around again."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a deep orange with a 2 finger, sticky, white head. The aroma is thick and full of fresh cut pine. The flavor is mellow pine, with a hint of oak. Burton Baton is a thick DIPA with a chewy mouthfeel. This is a brew to sip and enjoy over the course of the evening. Make sure that it is not too cold, the flavor improves drastically as it warms."
"Chewy bread feel, but also very creamy. Nonetheless, a surprisingly light - not light mind you, but lighter than expected - medium body. Goes down smooth. Not something to enjoy more than one, maybe two of."
"A marvelous example of an oak-aged DIPA. It's very drinkable for the ABV and an interesting take on the style. Absolutely worth a try."
"D- Pretty easy to drink and intersting. I'd recommend this one to any one. A good change of pace."
"This one gets better the more you drink it. I made mistake of not waiting long enough before the first taste. Definitely improves as it warms up."
"This beer poured a clear dark copper amber color and formed a large foamy off white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A small amount of carbon is present. An aroma of malt, hops and caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel, and pepper. The body was medium light and slightly creamy. Fairly heavy on the malt side for a double IPA, but still a good beer."
"Tasted super hoppy but not unbalanced. I am glad my father has a second 4 pack waiting for me back in jersey. This baby is really really good. Kudos to DFH and I am glad it will be available three times this year!"
"I thought the 90 minute IPA was awsome, but this is even better (if admittedly more expensive). I would love to see this one year-round too."
"D - Very enjoyable and quite easy to drink, but the alcohol definitely makes itself known."
"drinkable? not now, but give this one some time and it should be. ill revisit this beer in time, and expect alot more then. while its advertised as an imperial ipa, its actually part old ale. that part of the beer is whats ruining it now, and will improve with age. 5 days in the bottle is not enough time for this beer to get ready."
"Picked this one up at a Whole Foods in Louisville, if I remember properly, and 'aged' it several months in the beer cupboard. Pours a nice brown/amber and cloudy, with an average head. A kind of malty/fruity nose. Initial taste is strong and alcoholic (it's 10% ABV), with a complex, bourboney (from the oak barrels it's aged in) and kinda sweet taste that rolls on the tongue and leaves an almost sour aftertaste. This is most definitely one to savor and sip/take in slowly. Very satisfying and strong ale, but perhaps a tad strong for beginners."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a cloudy golden amber color with about two fingers of off white head. The oak aging comes through in the aroma right away. Vanilla and citrus hops, pineapple, caramel, and oak dominate the flavor. Really nice. I would say this is a full bodied beer with medium carbonation. Spicy alcohol sneaks in to tingle the back of the throat in the finish. A wonderful """sipping""" beer."
"Another winner from DFH."
"I initially liked the beer. I may have been influenced by the description on the label and really wanting to like it, as I like most DFH beers. But the more I drank, the more I was seeking hops and something to cut the malty, fruity sweetness. Won't buy it again."
"D: At 10% it's tough to commit to many of these, but if you can find this bottled it's a must try. I hope to find a few more."
"D - Definitely a beer that takes some time to drink a good sipping beer to relax with at the end of the day"
"Really enjoyable. I want to try one I know is fresh to see if there is a difference."
"I'd give it a 5 for drinkability, but I will pass on another one for now. It's just too simple."
"Taste begins with a massive sweet malt presence, noticeable spicy alcohol, and a spicy, piney hoppy undertone that reveals itself somewhat gradually. Finish is an understated hoppy bitterness, definitely smoothed out by the vanilla and oak smoothness. Definitely seems to be a big IPA crossed with a sweeter barleywine more than a standard double IPA, but whatever it is, I'd like another please. Preferably with another couple of years on it though, a little too much alcohol presence is the only fault I'd lay on this one. Delicious"
"When I first had this beer I thought it was something contemplative, elegant, and complex. Tasting it now, nearly two years later, I don't find it nearly as intricate but still every bit as good as I remember. I'll have to yank those other bottles from the cellar because I don't think a 10% beer is capable of being any more quaffable than this is now."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle...Silky, heavy mouthfeel. Oak and hops dominate this brew, but that no complaint, as the two balance each other very well. Also hints of caramel, honey, and floral notes. A very special IPA. This is on of my favorite Dogfish beers and always a treat when I get to have it"
"D: One bottle at a time, his one took me several hours to get through."
"D - For it's strength, I'm impressed at how easy this is to drink. The wood marries nicely with the hops, almost unexpectedly so. This is a rule-breaking beer and oak or wood aging is typically not appropriate in this style of beer. Never the less, Sam and the gang knew what they were doing and the vanilla-like flavors carry well with the floral hops. 1 Bottle is sufficient for me but I'm still giving a favorable score here."
"Overall: If you are into wood aged beers, love IPAs, this is the beer for you. Exactly what I expected, perfect. Also, if you have had DFHs 90 Minute IPA, imagine that with a complimenting wood swing, just glorious. Grab a four and make your palate happy!"
"A surprisingly lame offering from DFH. I was expecting something better then a 90 min and all I got was mediocre. There is nothing big about this beer except the firm sweet malts up front and the ABV glow. I will pencil Burton Baton down as a novelty act and one not to waste my money on again."
"The label invokes you to share this one - but I'll keep this one all to myself."
"Nose is hoppy as well as the first sip. Not picking up any oak from nose or taste. 10 percent wow alcohol burn and a little on the bitter side. I expected this to be a little smoother but its just shy of having a bite to it.Not one of my favs by a long shot.If youre a hop head go for if not steer clear."
"good job DFH."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this was another really good Dogfish Head beer. I have not been disappointed with any of their beers that I have had."
"Overall, I have to say I was disappointed with this beer, I think if it were less sweet, it might be quite interesting. I am laying one bottle down, maybe it will mellow."
"Bottle. Pours a dark amber, not much to the off-white head. Aroma is sweet, slight citrus, taste is sweet and sticky, overall, a little too sweet for me. Complex, but the sweetness is overwelming. I wonder if this would be better with a little age on it."
"The body is big. There is some alcohol heat but note overwhelming. Carbonation is low but ok. Overall I would call this a barleywine over a double IPA, but ok."
"D- going down really well. I think after one like most DFH high gravity, the crazy sweetness might be too much. Certainly will get more of this to age come 09"
"This beer is to be savored and enjoyed. This beer's layers of flavor are quite symbolic, they will be able to warm you on a bitter cold evening. If you've been saving this beer, I would encourage you to pour it now."
"D: Too boozy to be much higher. This is definitely a one-a-sitting beer for me. Tons of complexity to enjoy and savor, but not something that goes down so easily fresh. Aging could really make this a spectacular beer."
"Very interesting beer."
"Overall, a great sipping beer, nice hoppyness, nice oak. Just an overall tasty beer, lets see how this one ages."
"D: It is a heavy beer with a high ABV and thick sweet profile that would make it difficult to drink long into the night. This is a nice occasional sipper."
"drinkability: fairly good due to the excellent mouthfeel although the underlying alcohol warmth does catch up with you after a couple of bottles."
"D: Another quality beer from Dogfish Head, is it possible they make a bad beer, I don't think so, outstanding stuff."
"D: Notes taken from 04/12/08 tasting. This is a great and powerful DIPA. The only thing holding me back from trying this on a regular basis is the price."
"This is a very interesting beer. It is a cloudy golden beer. The aroma is of rich hops. apon first taste, it has a sweet hoppy and alcoholy taste. The oak aging added a unique complexness to this brew. I love the 10% alcohol content. This is a great beer for hopheads/people who love the 90 minute. The mouthfeel is longlasting and has moderate drinkability."
"D- Hell yes, I have another bottle I'm planning on aging for another 6 months to see how a year does with this beer. The age is the only way to go. Its just too raw to have fresh."
"Drinkability is good, knowing that you could only do 2 at max. A nice slow sipper with a big flavor."
"Poured a hazy light brown/copper color with a small amount of foam that quickly disappears but leaves some nice lacing. Lots of floaties swirling around the glass. Nice piney aroma with background notes of bitter chocolate, spicy hops, and a touch of citrus. Definitely on the malty side for DIPA. Not much of a boozy aroma for such a high ABV. Amazing flavor profile. Afine balance between the malt and hops, with a nice thick, oily pine hop resin flavor, followed up by some toasty malts. Subtle oakiness. Thick and creamy on the tongue. Low carbonation. High ABV can be felt as it goes down. A very tasty treat."
"This is a great beer to savor and enjoy slowly, much like their 120 minute. As it warms, it grows in flavor and complexity which makes it great for a nice peaceful evening at home."
"I would have this beer again, because it is smooth...but not because it is an IPA."
"I found this to be a good effort. It was a little too sweet for my liking and not bitter enough. The oak was a unique and enjoyable taste."
"Pours a medium amber with minimal head. Smell is mainly alcohol with some hop presence. Taste is a decent blend of malt and hops, but none of the oak barrel notes come through. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, yet smooth. A bit of harshness on the finish affects drinkability."
"I admit I had pretty high expectations here. The beer pours a copper, kind of ruby reddish color. The aroma is hoppy and fruity, a little winey, not tremendously strong but nice. The flavor is spicy and hoppy, some fruits, wood (oak?), a bit sour and syrupy. There's kind of a medicine taste to it. This ended up being a little different than I expected but still good and enjoyable."
"Poured into a tulip, the golden-brown liquid produced a finger of head for a moment. Has a nutty, bread-like smell with vanilla, caramel, cherries, and a hint of lime. Flavor begins with some smokey bourbon, mild raisins and full-on sweet mash. Finishes like an IPA with grapefruit zest and hop bite which demands another sip. Complex and a good-sized body. Another well-conceived dogfish head brew."
"Blended with fresh 90 minute IPA and oak aged IPA, I would love to try this on tap through the Randall."
"D-This is apretty good beer. Very big anf hot though, thisis what would cause me to moveon after one 10oz pour. I would look to have this again though for sure. I would imagine this beer would age quite nicely."
"A blackish seethru body with a thin one-finger head that left a lace ring. A malty smell of dough and wood along with some hops. Smooth and creamy like a stout, there is some sweetness in here on the tongue that then changes to a dry, citric fruit backbite from the hops. The ABV is noticeable in that it lends to the drying, warm sensation from swallowing the beer and makes this bad boy a sipper. I'd love to have this one again."
"Heavy mouthfeel with all that booze, and somewhat hard to drink without some food. A huge beer that leaves a mark."
"Enjoyable off centered beer experience. Keep at it Dogfish Head."
"12oz single bottle purchased for around $4.50 from Charles St Liquors in Boston. Brewed on date appears to be in February 2008, consumed at the end of May 2008 after being jealous that I didn't attend the DFH dinner at beerbistro in Toronto two nights before. Pours a cloudy, medium gold with a bit of head and just a bit of gentle carbonation. Aroma isn't too strong, and reminds me of some sherry-like barleywines - not my favourite thing, so I'm concerned. Ends up there's nothing to be concerned about. First sip is nice - very full and rich. The flavour is complex, like a Belgian. Hops are not dominant, but provide a nice bitterness as the beer goes down the throat a bit hot. Oak is noticeable. Full bodied. A nice sipper."
"Pours a very dark amber, let's just call it a brown. Very nice two inches of off white head. This is different. On the first taste, you get lots of malt, and a good amount of alcohol. There is a slight bit of fruit coming through as well. A good amount of hops in the taste. Just not the citrusy, juicy type. These are piney and grassy. Very malty and very big mouthfeel. I think superfresh and from the tap this would be better. Different, can't say that I've had anything like it. Which is why I love Dogfish Head."
"One of my new favorite IPAs"
"Drinkability: Very complex and interesting, but it's still ~10% abv, so you need to be careful. I'm impressed with DFH for attempting something so daring, though - let's hope we get more of the same from them in the future!"
"It's not that's it's """better""" than the usual DIPA, but different in the way it has oak flavor and an aged IPA blended with a new one."
"Mouthfeel was rich & full. Syrupy. Some mild alcohol sizzle."
"D: Tasty but a little too sweet for me, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style but the aging puts this beer into barleywine territory as happens with most 2IPA's, there are definitely several other beers whether they be 2IPA or ABW that I'd choose over this one, but it's still a good beer for being an intentionally aged 2IPA."
"A heavenly milk shake of earl gray, intense low note hop oil, and vanilla. Truly a pleasure to have the pourage rest in the mouth and deliver its comlexity. Smells of fig and dates that hover over the full, finger depth, beige head. The sweet and spicy oil never travels out of range; and may I add, the range is far beyond the status quo. Alcohol occasionally jumps to attention, but is welcomed because it does not travel solo; it is accompanied by rich dark fruits, sticky flan, and the genius of Dogfish Head. A remarkable treat."
"Pours kind of a dark honey color, with some ruby highlights, long-lasting tan head and plenty of lacing. Boozy smell, definitely getting plenty of the oak aroma, some citrus notes in there too, but there's just a bracing alcoholic fume rising out of the glass. Tastes very sweet, borderline-syrupy, spicy oak, slightly tannic, a bit of vanilla...there's a lot going on in here. Really smooth, the consistency of this beer has been my favorite part. I'm always glad to try something from Dogfish Head, but this one just isn't for me. Definitely worth checking out, though, as there's a lot of crazy things happening here."
"i like this but it's damn intense... all in all im thinking about whiskey, not that i never sipped a whiskey this smooth... but its a damn good sippin beer and not offensive to those who find an ipa too hoppy... if your gout acts up or your chest burns when you drink your bourbon try sippin this instead, its not the same but then neither is anything else in your miserable life now that you got to.. how do they say?... 'moderate'?"
"I wouldn't find this to be a very good match for a variety of occasions. Fine for sitting at home and sipping, always...as part of a social tasting, would be great...a winter-time beer for sure...but it's strong and boozy, big and sugary, and really not that hoppy, considering it's based on an Imperial IPA (90 Minute). Sometimes it doesn't even seem well-balanced. So I can't rate the drinkability that high. But I'd never kick it outta my glass. All in all, another highly appreciated and above-average beer from the lords at DFH."
"Fullish in body with mild carbonation. Great drinker given the 10% ABV."
"D: One 12oz. bottle is enough. A sipper, not a gulper."
"D - The alcohol taste and lower hop level detracted from the experience for me. A good beer but not my style."
"D_I am actually really enjoying this though I would not label it as an 2xIPA which is the only thing that depreciates the score. An intriguing brew that I would highly recommend."
"Pours a burnt orange color with little to no head. Smell is citrusy with some wood coming through. Taste of grapefruit, pine and vanilla. The hops are not overpowering at all and the alcohol is well hidden. This is a well crafted beer and goes down quite easy for a beer of 10%."
"Not very hoppy. A good effort by Dogsfish and a good beer, but the alcohol is a bit too apparent for my taste. A great sour citrus taste though."
"Drinkability is ok worth a try but at this price should be mind blowing for me to buy and drink regularly and its not but it is defiantly worth a try, hell maybe even a retry."
"Not cloyingly sweet, but extremely malty. The oak and hoppy spice caracters lend this beer its drinkability."
"D - Tasty. Obviously not for sessioning- a one or half a night beer."
"if you have the money and want to try something interesting,go for it."
"D - Yet another extreme beer from DFH that's quite drinkable despite the high ABV and hop content. This one is bursting with complex flavors and it's not as unapproachable as I had anticipated. Very nice!"
"drinkability is pretty good. the alcohol is there, but pretty much balanced by the caramel+malt and hops. the barrel character is unobtrusive and nice. overall i enjoyed this one and i'm glad i have another in the cellar."
"Very, very drinkable for something with this alcohol content. Really, a quite remarkable product from DFH."
"The variety of scents do help one know what to expect in the taste (as they should) but only a bit though. It doesn't quite prepare ya for what's in store. According to the Dogfish Head website this is a combo of their 90 Minute IPA and English strong ale stored away in the wood casks until it's ready for bottling. The wood aging gives this a smokey and slight caramel sweetness all of it's own, subduing the smack of hops that the 90 brings with it and mellowing the bitter bluster that a good portion of strong ales bring with them. As the sips go on and the beers warms a little the a citrus tang from the hops becomes more noticable but never over take the proceedings. The flavors of the oak and the 90 Minute IPA compliment each other nicely and the full & creamy consistency of the beer itself make for a pleasent feeling in the mouth and down the throat. The aftertaste has something like a cinnamon and citrus thing going on but it's not overbearing nor does it carry too much stickiness with it. If you're looking for a straight up D-IPA this is probably not what you're looking for but if you're interested in seeing what kind of things can be done with one, giving it a flavor exclusive to itself, this is one to pick up."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are easily consumed, but more than 12 oz. is questionalb.e, expecially at 10% ABV."
"This is a really great beer and may be my favorite dfh tried to date. The blend of these two styles together really compliment each other well."
"Thanks to barleywinefiend for this beer! Decanted from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a two-finger thick head that subsides to a thin layer of foam. Aroma has resiny hops, citrus hops, and some malty sweetness. Taste has some gentle floral bitterness and a shit ton of malt sweetness. This is a DIPA? The oak influence shows itself in the aftertaste. Has a medium body that is silky smooth. I could put down several of these pretty quickly, making the drinkability pretty high. This doesn't like a DIPA to me at all. However, it's still pretty damn good."
"A nice flavorful example of a DIPA. I don't know how much the oak-aging really added to this compared to 90Min. The alcohol severly limits consuming this beer. Very pricey as well and likely only a one time purchase."
"D: Pretty big and a definite sipper. Slow, easy, and it will leave the drinker feeling quite nice!"
"Drinkability: Honestly, I could drink this forever, along with a few others to mix it up with. this has found a place in my heart for sure."
"This is the almost scary (in a good way) part - it is incredibly smooth and silky, making this disappear very quickly despite the sweetness and heat. Kind of like an open box of chocolates - can't help but keep on going. Dangerously drinkable, but at the price (and the abv?) one will have to do."
"One of the better imperial IPAs I've had. I wish I had another to hang onto for awhile."
"D: At 10% ABV can't have too many of these, but excellent flavor for the style. IMO This has many of the same characteristics of a barleywine. But I digress, many try their hands at a DIPA's, but DFH really shines with this one. Skal."
"A beer made to drink slow and enjoy. Definitely one to try."
"This is a good beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it, but I think I'll stick with 90min IPA. I like the earthy, oaky flavors that the barreling imparts, but the booze is too hot. Definitely worth a try for the IPA lover."
"Poured this monster into a pint glass, pours a seriously impressive goldish brown color with some serious sediment in there cloudy and beatiful just the way I like it. The smell was sweet with hints of malty goodness, molasses and also some raison hints. Taste was pretty good nice oak florish flavor with a bit of a hop bitterness, I was expecting more hop in there but it was a bit mild, alcohol almost not detected until it warmed a bit. DFH brews some interesting brews and this one is pretty straight foward and very good, I would have this again."
"D: This beer assails the palate. Sipping is a good thing, and to me, more than one is out of the question. However, this is a pretty decent DIPA and, though it's balancing on the border of tastefulness, is a nice use of wood-aging."
"Thanks to the soon-to-be-missed Dr. Pitz! May you find good beer in the Volunteer State (or at least not get stuck in traffic on the way to Kentucky!)."
"D: The alcohol warming effect makes you slow down a bit. Since it is pretty smooth it is still very drinkable for the style."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer. Only thing that would limit me here is the 10% ABV. The 90 minute would be my go to but this is a very good beer that I highly recommend."
"M/D- any carbonation is overriden by the slick malt. It glides down like a thin syrup. If I were tasting this blind I would guess barleywine, easily. But an oak-aged IIPA? Crazy. It's sweet, yet has a hop presence in the background that is unmistakable."
"Dr - I could have a couple as the taste is smoother as you go along. It takes you on a small journey of self discovery. I love it!"
"Edit: I drank one, got me two proper pours last night. It got me buzzin' though. Might have been because it was late, but it had a good effect for a 12 oz. Still love it."
"D- Doesn't blow me away, but it is smooth and complex and was nice for something different."
"Holy crap this is good. I am consistently blown away by DFH's many DIPAs. Always interesting, unique, and amazing. Here, beer pours a copper-amber color with a finger of head that leaves just a bit of lacing. Looks good, though nothing too inspired. Nose, however, is crazy. Tons of oak, toffee malt, light saltiness. Caramel comes through with dried fruit, and then a strong hit of spicy hops. Smells amazing. Flavor is similarly outstanding. Oak again, then strong toffee malt. Citrus. Strong drying, slightly salty hops that stay with you in an extended aftertaste. Not a trace of the 10% ABV. Oakiness sticks with you as well. A mix of dried fruit - grapes and prunes. Medium, creamy body with perfect carbonation. Overall, an outstanding beer."
"D- VERY well balanced for a DIPA making this an easy drinking DIPA. I loved it and I am glad I had the chance to try this. One to look out for- for sure."
"i really enjoyed this beer, a tad too costly to be a staple of mine but still very good"
"Great that it'll be in CA (hopefully) now that they're distributing here, again."
"D: Extremely high. This is easily once of the best IPA style beers I've ever had. The oak and sweetness keep it from being to hoppy. I could spend an entire evening sipping this brew if only it weren't such a precious elixer. Find yourself a case of this and buy it...you won't be disappointed."
"D: A very nice and well balanced flavor with a bitterness that was polished, and smooth to drink. Abv is fairly well hidden."
"Drinks pretty good despite the abv & the style, a different kind of DIPA, but tasty, none the less"
"With a well hidden ABV, I seems as though I could drink this one all night."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy but well-carbonated. No alcohol apparent."
"d: This was very good, just a bit too sweet and alcoholic. Almost a great one from DFH."
"D - Drinkability is good. The high abv makes this a sipper. I would easily drink more of these. The barrel aging does add a dynamic to the typical Imperial India Pale Ale style that makes this beer very interesting."
"Drinkability - This one goes to #1 on my DIPA list. I've always been a fan of their 90 minute but this goes above and beyond anything from them or anyone else. I may need a second job to support this addiction."
"I intend to hoard some more of this beer and then I'll think about the sharing thing."
"Drinkability: Drinkability suffers a bit because of the big sweetness. Again, not overbearing, but sweet enough to hamper it's drinkability. Very smooth. Definitely a beer to sip and enjoy."
"Overall a charming, warming and graceful BIG beer. The sweet and dry aspect really does it for me. The oily, silky and soft body makes this a joy to quaff. The creaminess is very regal and makes it also a joy to consume. A gentle giant of an ale with the hops taking the spotlight while the malty elements take the strong supporting role. Bravo DFH!"
"Wo Mama, this one packs a serious hop punch. Dark orange color with a heavy tall sand colored head. The smell is hops and a citrus basket. You can't ignore the hops with the first sip followed by the taste of pine, biscuits and a hint of molasses getting more and more candy like with each sip. The feel is like a thin syrup with lots of sudz, yummy... At 10 ABV and 3 dollars plus a bottle, definitely not one you'd want more then one of in a night drink. Had it with a chicken panini and it seems to be a good pairing."
"Pours deep amber with a thin tan head. Big aroma of caramel, citrus and pine. Oak really comes out in the flavor with starts with a blast of sweeet malts and goes directly to a warming alcohol finish with some bitterness at the end. Alcohol is clearly present. The hops do NOT dominate here, and I would have appreciated a bit more flora and pine character. Still tasty."
"This is the best-tasting, best-drinking DIPA I have ever had."
"Truly enjoyable offering, but I'll quibble a bit on the price, as I tend to do from Dogfish Head. Small, slight head and a deep copper color, and that's where the wining ends. The taste is tremendous, hops and oak in tremendous balance, I'll say it does a better job on this than the Oaked Arrogant Bastard from Stone. Immensely drinkable, which is no small feat considering the ten percent ABV. I set one aside to age, and this is good enough that I may lay a full four pack down and sample at my leisure."
"Edit: I drink some more, and it just gets worse. This is a horrible beer. Seriously, how is this a 4.1 average? The last half of the bottle is going down the drain. There is no excuse for ** like this."
"Aroma is not strong, but fairly hoppy with a surprising fruity overtone, like apricot or peach. Pours a rich dark brownish amber with a thick, fluffy head - darker than most IPAs I have tried. Flavor is rich and hoppy but not too bitter, with a pleasantly smoky hint. This ale dances on your tongue and leaves a hoppy, satisfying aftertaste."
"I'm a fan of the 60 min IPA, the 90 min IPA, the ApriHop and a few others so I was glad when a friend brought this to a tasting. This is an oak-aged Imperial IPA that doesn't have an overpowering hop aroma. It pours a cloudy amber. A sweet alcohol taste up front gives way to one that is more floral and citrusy. I'm wondering where the oak flavor is? A smooth mouthfeel and quite drinkable. Overall, it's good, but I'm disappointed that it doesn't have the hop kick."
"Pours a nice murky amber with a small offwhite head. Smell is very malty with caramel tones, some oak, and a hint of alcohol. Cloying from the nose alone... Taste is also incredibly overly sweet. Sugary syrupy sweetness and some oakiness with no balance whatsoever from hops. Not only a huge disappointment but one of the most undrinkable beers I've ever had. Not what I expected."
"Bought at Bottleworks for 3.99. This beer had delicious written all over it. Poured in a tulip shaped glass, poured a thick creamy head, very nice to see with a wood aged ale. The smell was of piny hops,Oak and malt. The taste was a nice hop bite, and full of malt, balanced with Oak. It went great with the full head that dissipated about half way through. The mouth-fell was very smooth and velvety not much alcohol taste with the 10% abv. This beer put a warm feel through my body that went to my feet. I bought 2 of these and they are ready to drink now but I think ill age one just for the hell of it. The only thing I would change about this one is make it a tad more Oak'y tasting. But this is a GREAT beer, I will purchase next season and drink my aged(if it lasts) with a fresh one and compare. CHEERS"
"Drinkability: A slow and visceral sipper with a lot of flavor and complexity. Though I don't really cellar IPAs anymore, I wonder about the complexity of flavors in the future and what could happen with the wood. I don't think I could do a bomber or anything bigger in one sitting, but 12 ounces is perfect."
"D: I was happy to get a couple of cases of this and shared the wealth with some friends. At 10% this is not a brew to be taken lightly."
"M/D: Carbonation is a bit high but OK, full bodied. Drinkability is good really because of the taste alone. It's pretty filling and it's a sipper, but I could really sip one after another. A really excellent and unique beer."
"Great beer all around here, pick some up and give it a try."
"Jan 07 bottle from one of the best. Head gone after a minute. Great vannilla and dark fruit smell. Give it a nice big swrill and stick your nose in it for a treat. Very malty and still some lingering bitterness. Smooth and sweet alcohol taste, not hot. Nice, balanced and ages well."
"This is a pretty high octane beer with a lot going on. This one is for enjoying."
"D: At $13 a 4-pack, I am unlikely to get any more. This is a good beer that may get a better drinkability score if it were not so pricey. I have drank many beers at this price that I would recommend over this one."
"D: A great beer for sipping, but not something of which you can have more than 1 or 2 before the palate wears out."
"Poured an orangish amber color with a thin white head with good retention that sticks all over the sides of the glass. The aroma is malt, a floral sweetness, bubblegum, vanilla and alcohol. Taste is creamy with a nice maltiness in the beginning that is followed with a flowery and fruitiness with the hops rounding out the finish and some warming from the alcohol. You can also pick up on the influences from the oak as well in the taste. To expensive and the oak should have been more prominent."
"Not a huge fan, surprisingly. I do find it intriguing and worth the try, but I can't get the overall flavor to be one that seems pleasant. Alcohol is unbalanced and the flavors seem to blend coarsely into a difficult version of an IIPA. Tempted to seek out another bottle to determine if this one is somehow off from the norm."
"It's got good balcane but it does have a strong alcohol taste. All in all a good beer!"
"Poured an amber color with a two inch head that falls into a lite lace around the edge. The smell was a piney with a hint of citrus. Tasted hoppy but finished with a taste a malt. I really liked this beer and dispite the price (which I understand) I will get again."
"Spotted this at Green's on Buford Highway in Atlanta, Georgia. Pours a deep amber color that just screams """drink me.""" Nice creamy head and a lace along the side of the glass. Smells is very piney and citrusy. Taste is very hoppy - big surprise I know. But there is a strong malt backbone to back this beer up. Almost a meal in a bottle for me. Another fantastic brew from Dogfish Head. They have IPA's down in my book."
"Faintly hoppy, loaded with crystal malt, mild aspirin, a surprising amount of oak. Boozy. Sweet and quite tannic, plenty of crystal malt flavor but not enough sweetness to balance out the astringent oakiness. Full in body but the oak is just way too raw and in your face. Tannic and caramel sweetness on the finish. Despite some severe flaws, this is decent, especially as an OA BW. 3.5/3/3/3"
"Overall a very good brew, normally I don't like hopbombs, but this one might change my mind."
"Pours a dark copper color with a decent, white fluffy head that dissolved fairly quickly. It left behind a nice layer of bubbles on top and on the side of my pint glass. A roasted sweetness hits the nose first, but is then overtaken by spicy and floral hoppiness. A very spicy and woody flavor that is supported by a nice malty foundation. Not as hoppy as I was hoping it would be, but a really good beer. Very creamy and not overly carbonated. I should have stocked up on this stuff when I had the chance to throw some in the cellar."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Full body and good carbonation. Has aged pretty well, but I would like to try a fresh bottle."
"Solid stuff. Very enjoyable to savor."
"This poured a clear auburn color with light tan head. It smelled like a mix of copper and floral hops with noticeable oak and burnt caramel malt, along with a hint of alcohol. Its flavor came in waves, first of brown sugar and molasses, then of copper and floral hops, then of oak and roasted malts, then of brown sugar again for a smooth and sweet aftertaste. It was oily with very slight carbonation and a bit of alcohol warming. Overall this was a very unique and enjoyable beer that was well balanced and had great, creamy flavor. Hooray!"
"D - woah I don't remember this being this good, but I am loving this beer tonight while I wait for dinner to cook! It's a bit full bodied to do more than 1 or so in a sitting, but man, this thing hides its relatively high ABV pretty well and is a joy to sip. Good work DFH!"
"D: I was surprised how easy it was to drink this one considering the 10% abv. Once again, the alcohol seemed a little brutish, but the rest of this beer is so awesome it more than makes up for it."
"Mouthfeel was a lingering syrup with the ever upfront presence of alcohol. However, strangely enough, I would buy this again because I do like the higher ABV's. Better yet, I would definitely """order""" this, if possible, at a pub to enjoy-gives you a hell of a great start to tying one on....If that's what your inclination is..."
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark amber color with plentiful off-white head. Aromas, if memory proves true, are nearly indistinguishable for a 90 min. The strong citrusy and piney hops dominate, but an earthy, candy like sweetness is present, a sign of oak? Alcohol notes are present too; overall its bouquet is comparable to a citrusy fruitcake. On the palate, the 90 min likeability is burdened by an aged, old hop feel. Oakiness isn't like any other oaked beer I've had. It's subdued, provides a firm tannic feel, slightly astringent, but sweet in the finish as well. The malt profile provides plenty of honey like floral flavors with lots of sweetness to balance the hop presence. I would liken this to a dry-hopped old ale rather than a DIPA. The finish brings some puckery dryness and vanilla notes reminiscent of the oak. Overall, another crazy beer from DFH, enjoyable, but I'm content with just one bottle."
"HV"
"Overall, I was expecting a bit more from this beer given previous ratings. However, and in fairness, I'm sure it will taste twice as good given 6 months. So I have a few I plan to cellar."
"Drinkability - If you enjoy oak-aged beers or Imperial IPA's, I recommend this beer for you! It's a beer that one is perfect, but two might even be better! Good job Sam and the DFH Gang!!!"
"-Kevin."
"D: one to savor. you won't be drinking a four pack a night. another great beer from Dogfish Head"
"D: Had with lunch and really wanted another... its subtle and well balanced.. a good showing from Dogfish Head"
"12 oz bottle. Pours orange amber with two phase head, foam on top of bubbles, 2 cm head thats off-white. Aroma of yeast and hops, slight hint of citrus. Initial flavor is citrus and pine, switching to a more dry finish by the end with a hint of alcohol that sits on the tongue for an extended period. Moderate lacing, long aftertaste, medium body, and lots of alcohol noted. Drinks like a mellowed out IPA with a big bite. Standard greatness from Dogfish."
"I would put this in the category of extreme beers. It is delicious particularly for hop heads, but it would be extremely difficult to have more than one."
"I little disappointed, not sure if I will get again."
"Smells very hoppy (Cascade hops maybe?). The hops taste like citrus, especially pineapple. The oak aging is definitely apparent, and imparts a vanilla sweetness on the brew. What a great offering. From start to finish it is unique and delicious. You can always count on DFH to come up with something innovative."
"Dogfish Head Burton Baton pours a deep copper with a a nice head that lingers as a dense creamy layer that leaves a beautiful lacing on the glass. The aroma is fresh citrusy hop cones with a nice carmel maltiness and a touch of oak. You've gotta hand it to DFH, they do an amazing job getting the beer to taste and smell like you just stuck your nose into a handful of hops. The flavor starts off with dark caramel malt, followed quickly by by hop bitterness and flavor. The hops are nice and citrusy, plenty of grapefruity flavor. I'm pretty sure I taste Chinook and some other American """C"" hops. There is a hint of oak in the finish but it's light and not overpowering. I think this is the first time I've had this beer outside the EBF's, where it was hard to appreciate after all the other DIPA's, RIS, and barley wines."
"Certainly not a horrible brew, but not the best depiction put forth from Dogfish Head..."
"Very Nice. Very Nice!"
"Where I can indeed tell that this is over 6%, I feel it drinks below 10, so the alcohol is well hidden. If I didn't know any better, I would guess this to be low 8's; 8,3, perhaps? This is really good beer and I'm glad to have had the chance to try it."
"M/D: This is really heavy and creamy. Couldn't have more than 2 of these. The rich mouthfeel will keep me buying this as long as I can."
"D: This is a surprisingly drinkable DIPA. Most of DFH's stronger offerings I find to be too sweet, but this time, this is incredibly well-balanced and tasty. Very enjoyable."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. In a blind tasting I would not have picked it out as a DIPA though, more of a hopped American Strong Ale, but whatever DFH wants to call this, it is enjoyable."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and although it was $18.99 for a 4-pack, I would definitely get it again. Excellent!"
"Poured from bottle into Dogfish Head pint glass. This beer looked a little darker than the average IPA from the mix with the strong ale. Smell is of oak, hops, and a little vanilla. Easy to drinkand has a nice mouthfeel. I think this could be a little better chilled than the 60 degrees or so I drank it at. Overall a nice mix of flavors and I am interested to see how this one ages."
"Drinkability - not especially hoppy or oaky, but after a year the hops are more a preservative than a flavoring ingredient. The sweetness makes this a dessert style sipper, another winter winner, but not one that was all that distinctive to me."
"I think that this would be a great beer to give anyone who poopoos beer for brown liquors."
"clear coppery amberish with a tan head that holds fairly well and leave a little lace. first thing that comes to mind when i sniff is oak and smoke, but some fruit (banana, and passsion mostly) and flowers come through as well as a hint of brown sugar. taste - oaked for sure, and unlike the nose, i get a smokey hop taste riding on an oaky malt backbone. good, creamy, medium full body with a nice warming finish. it seems to me that it would be hard to drink too many of these, but it's fun to try and another great effort from dfh. a lot of time must have gone in to making this beer, but i won't be spending a lot of time drinking it. give me a 90 minute any day."
"12 oz., bottled on __/16/07 (the first number of the ink-jet printing was rubbed out), brewed with Northwest hops. By the end of the bottle I found myself reviewing this beer based on overall impression rather than to style - had I reviewed to style it certainly would have garnered lower points. Anyway, the beer pours into the balloon glass a clear, dark copper, with low carbonation and an inch of khaki head that leaves a few rings of lace. Smells of malted grain first, followed by grapefruity hops, which are in turn followed by vanilla and sweet, oaky bourbon notes. Starts quite nice, but becomes sweet and lightly boozy, and my aroma score is an average of those sentiments. On the palate, it is malty sweet - quite cloying actually. It's very fruity, backed by vanilla and oak, with additions of dark fruits and some buttery diacetyl. The hops are beaten down by the massive malts, and relegated to mere supporting roles, giving hints of citrus and pine, while imparting only a mild bitterness. The body is full and too heavy, with low carbonation, drying tannins, and a long, sweet/dry finish. It has a good aroma and some decent flavors, but is way off-balance. The beer is way too sweet, which lowers the drinkability immensely, and the hops are definitely there, but have a hard time making themselves known, which is odd for a double (albeit offbeat) IPA. I was very excited to finally find this, but was ultimately let down. I'll let the other bottle mellow for a couple years and see if it improves."
"A nice experience overall. I'm glad I got a single bottle as opposed to a four-pack, but no regrets over that single bottle."
"Pours a deep dark amber color with 1 finger head that retains for most of the beer. Smell is earthy wood then hops and sweet malts at the end. The taste is extremely complex with wood and hints of vanilla then the hops then the wood again. The mouthfeel is crisp and creamy much like an IPA. At 10% they pack a much meaner punch then the close 90 minute IPA. You can tell a difference in the effect but the effect is great. Again and again Dogfish Head does it again. Can't wait for that Chocolate beer soon."
"D - Not my favorite, but a very interesting take on the Double IPA and another genre-bender from Dogfish Head. The oak aging adds a great deal of flavor and complexity, but it also takes away the starring role of the hops. I have been aging this one for a bit, so I'd be interested to try this one fresher when the hops might be more expressive. Worth trying out, especially if you enjoy oak-aged beers."
"Special thanks to ilovedarkbeer (from ratebeer) for this taste treat. Aroma is sweet (as is the taste) encompassing lemon, apple, ruby port and a bit of soy sauce. Pour yields a smallish off-white head that disappears after a bit. Good lacing. Color is like a nice Bourbon. Taste is extremely sweet with absolutely no bitterness (IPA?). Alcohol comes across on the finish (which I like). Great stuff."
"The alcohol is really powerful; I realized about three-quarters of the way into the glass that this would be the only beer I would experience that day. It was much more than I could have imagined!"
"A few years later, I had the opportunity to sample a fresh bottle that was less than three months old and what a different experience - the piney hops are much more apparent in the aroma and on the palate, with the oaky elements adding a dry, woody touch, as well. Consequently, I boosted my scores by .5 for the T/M/D elements."
"Now, I purchased another 6 of Hop Slam today ... I'm sure I know which will prevail of the two, if I'm up to it."
"Big body that coats the mouth. A bit on the heavy side. Good sipping beer but I couldn't drink more than about a half-pint at a time."
"It is a bit sweet to have more than one. However, it is a great special occasion beer."
"drinkability - Enjoyed , stored for almost a year. Can't wait till Feb. kicks around again."
"Pours a clear darker amber with a white head that falls to nothing after a while. Nose is slightly hopped with a thick raisin quality to it. Flavor is extremely sweet at first in a syrup like kind of way. Very slight noticeable alcohol. Raisin flavor is strong. Feel is thin with bubble and thick and strong with syrup qualities. Almost seems elixir like. Definitely drinkable. I wouldnt go so far as to say this is one of the best DIPAs around, but it is pretty interesting in a Dogfish Head kinda way."
"Just an excellent beer that I will be having again and again and again and...."
"As for the taste, spicy yet malty. Getting some oaked fruityness. Kinda all over the place. I'm glad to see the hops still present on the tongue. I'm not sure what kind went into the hop bill, but they have stood the test of time. It's definitely drinking like an oak aged barleywine. Medium/+ mouthfeel. Thicker than your average IIPA but very smooth. You can tell the alcohol is there, but the 10% well hidden. I've had 8%'ers that were more boozy than this. It does catch up to you at the end of the beer though. I'm glad I have 4 more of these vintages. This is how I like my """barleywines", hoppy and complex. The oak really doesn't hurt either."
"D: Very tasty and I find it hard to take my time sipping it. I could find myself drunk before I knew it if I wasn't careful. I'd like to try this fresh to compare but I'm thinking in between 1 and 2 years would be a good drinking window."
"D. The abv and limited ability would drop this score. I have like many of DFH's beers,but like 120MIN this is too sweet."
"I have to say that I am a fan of a lot of DFH beers (i.e. 60 Min, WW Stout, Indian Brown, Raison D'Etre), but the sweetness presented by this beer is something that I have had a problem with in the Immort Ale as well as the 120 Minute IPA. It is very syrupy and just unpleasant. I will say the Burton Baton is my favorite of those three beers. I was able to drink the entire bottle, but it was somewhat of a struggle and I will not be trying it again for quite some time. If you're into the Immort or 120 Min then give it a shot, otherwise try laying it down for a year or two after you buy it and then see if the flavors develop a bit more."
"D: If it wasn't so sweet it would be good. This beer reminds me of a Camelot mead that I once had. Too sweet, and it doesn't mellow in your glass like some beers that initially shock you. If you like sweet, drink this beer."
"The beer cascades from the 12 ounce bottle a slightly bemused orange amber color with a generous bright creamy white head that very slowly dissipates, leaving the lace to forms tight concealing curtain. Nose is filled with fruit aromas, banana, peaches, cumquats, (just kidding about the cumquats), pleasant oak like tartness, strawberry cotton candy sweetness also noted. Front has a delectable toasted grain profile with the vanilla tartness at the back, also, the alcohol, makes an appearance, top is medium in feel to the palate. Finish has perky acidity, the hop flowers spicy and the alcohol warms the tummy, sweetly dry aftertaste sticks mightily to the palate, this is a magnificent beer, oak-aged 90 minute ale, toasted malt, and the snap of the alcohol, WOW!"
"I was excited to see how the oak would interact with the hops on this powerhouse ale. A huge 3 finger head jumps to the top of the glass with perfect tan color. This was a surprise for an oak aged brew to have this much carbonation and head retention. Body is an attractive dark brownish amber. Nose has presence of vanilla, soft hops, oak and maybe a hint of tree sap. Super interesting array of flavors going on here. Dark ripe fruit, syrupy hops, orange drink, rich almost peppery malt notes, and an oaked bitter sweet throughout. Slight lengthy bitter forms tword the end. Warms the belly well yet alchol is well hidden in the taste. Thick mouthfeel for the style. Very enjoyable."
"Thanks to todd1 for this bottle!"
"D: It's a sipper, but it sure is a good 'un. Glad I ordered it."
"I love this beer. Not being a huge fan of super-hopped IPAs, the caramelly, butterscotched flavors of Burton Baton are great. Though I can understand that people expecting more of a hop-punch will be disappointed or have a blah reaction. This almost ventures into dessert-wine territory. I'm going to save four bottles of this stuff and try it out in a year or two."
"Dogfish Head is becoming a favorite of mine...."
"I will put the other 3 bottles down.... for a LONG time... maybe that will calm the sweetness."
"The bottle says to share it with loved ones and hoard it from non-believers. Well I am a believer in all that DFH does, so Sudsdog thanks for sharing."
"Really hideous."
"Drinkability - this is good ale. The high abv limits sessionability. If you are looking for a DIPA, you may be a little let-down, as the barrel-aging seems to almost utterly mellow out the hops to a non-entity, even as a bittering agent - but..., nonetheless this is a good big beer to sip and enjoy."
"Very cloear copper colour- surprisingly so. Perhaps quite filtered. Not much head to speak of, some minor lacing. Smell- smells quite sugary. Taste- very sweet wtih the woods fairly pronounced. Medium cabonation. Slightly boozy with caramel and doughy malts in forefront. The hops are more herbal and grassy than bitter citrus. It finishes decently though- not too much cloying sweetness on the finish. The vanilla and wood really shows up on the finish too. Hops are kind of an afterthought in this beer. Drinkability is decent- it is a slow sipper. Quite enjoyable, not an every day beverage."
"Don't drink and review."
"Powerful ale, lots of malt and hops. Incredibly sweet  but balancingly hopped. I like it. Good sipper."
"Overall impression, a nice Imperial to consume on a evening at dusk during the fall months."
"This beer poured a copper/orange color with a light head. The aroma is of malt and caramel with the hops noticeable in the background. The taste is sweet and malty with not as much hop flavor as I expected  slight bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full and a bit oily. Overall this is an interesting beer that is complex, but perhaps a little too sweet for more than one in a session."
"For me, this was an example of too much of a good thing, pumped up with so much that it just couldn't carry the burden. Heavy mouthfeel, bordering on syrupy. Powerfully sweet malt wrestled with a blunt hops attack. A bit of burn from the ETOH. Not a badly made beer, by any means, but the volume was turned up too high."
"Drinkability/notes: Superbly crafted, as are all Dogfish Head products, well worth a try."
"This made an excellent nightcap, but I don't think I would want to consume several in a sitting, due to both the high abv and sweetness, whihc might be disagreeable in a large quantity. One of the most interesting beers I've had in a while, and I'd buy it again to serve as a nightcap or dessert beer."
"I probably went into this review with a slight prejudice. I love oak aged beers. Aroma was nutty, dark chocolate, mild coffee, but not very hoppy. Of course it had a large oak aroma as well as some vanilla. Small creamy head that disappeared. Flavor bordered on that of a barleywine rather than a DIPA. One can tell this is DFH beer - sweet. Almost too sweet. I've set quite a few aside to age for a year or two."
"Drinkability/Notes: A pretty malty DIPA, not quite what I was expecting considering I've had this beer previously. It definitely mellowed out since the 1st time I tried this. Hops are very subdude but in a good way. Plenty of molasses and brown sugar with the oak playing a nice roll. Alcohol is present in the nose and the flavor profile but its not overwhelming. All in all a really well crafted beer. I would almost consider this a barleywine instead of a DIPA but who cares, its still a damn fine beer. Definitely a beer to savor and one I will buy again. Seek and enjoy, highly recommended."
"A wonderful brew through and through. Had it with Brats and I thought I died and went to beer heaven. Will definitly pick this one up again. The label says to """...hoard from the non-believers.""" And that is exactly what I plan to do."
"Drinkability: I was shocked at such a sweetness for only 10%. That being said, this beer has plenty of flavors to keep a beer geek interested but I don't think I could drink more than one due to its cloying nature. I love Dogfish Head beer and applaud them for producing such a ballsy brew. Cheers!"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel with nice carbonation lightly tickles the tongue. It was hard to put 12 oz. of this stuff down because of the sweetness. Might be interesting to age a bottle and enjoy in the Winter, but I found it hard to drink."
"I bought a 4 pack and so far I have finished three (not at one time) and set one away for aging. Hopefully aging this brew improves it a little bit. Perhaps my palate is not as developed as it should be to fully appreciate this brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- With the most subtle carbonation, the texture expands marginally to add some body to the deep, oaky flavors here. This is not an easy beer to savor, sip, or swig... but it's an adventure nonetheless. I would have loved to have tried this pre-storage just to compare."
"Poured a pure, nectar-like honey color with good retention and nice head presence. Clean smell of hops, but with extra richness and presence that goes deeper than other DIPA's. Smooth taste of an IPA, but more maltiness and not the blasting of hops that you would expect. Honeylike from start to finish. Similar to a combination of a DIPA and a well-aged barleywine. Warming in the body and the smooth nectar presence in the mouth is pure and perfect. Watch yourself so it doesn't go down so fast. Incredible stuff here."
"I wonder what beer AndoBrew and I will try next!"
"The drinkablity on this one was low. Way to sugary and pretty much no hops. My beer store, which has pretty high turn over, just got this, so even though it's from back east, I doubt it's that old that the hops would have faded so much. And the malt is so sweet and fresh and sugary. I'll easily forget about the other one I have until it's well past it's prime I'm sure, even though that's probably 5-10 years out (prime being relative). From what I'd heard of this brew, it was very dissapointing. And then I remembered I've felt this way about pretty much ever DFH brew I've ever had!"
"The aroma is very interesting. There's a little ripe fruit, a bit of malt, and a huge, expressive hoppiness...citrus and must. There's also a wood character that makes a nice back-statement. The taste is sweet, but balanced with a long and solid bitterness. The beer if full bodied, and the flavors are very intense, which seems to hide the alcohol. Still, there's a little warming by the end of the glass. This is a great brew."
"Poured a dark golden or light brown into an oversized wine glass. Very little head, but lots of lacing as I drink. Oak and vanilla are prominent in the aroma, with a little bit of piney hops and soap in there for good measure. Smells sweet, and the taste follows up big time. I actually was not a huge fan of this -- I realize the oak aging dulls the hops and increases sweetness, but for me it was surprisingly cloying. Maybe it was just the surprise factor, but I didn't find it as amazingly drinkable as some people have. Flavour is heavy on the vanilla, caramel, cotton candy, and molasses. A little bit of field fruit and grassy hops in there as well. Mild bitterness shows up in the aftertaste. Well above average, but not knock-me-out wow."
"Pours a beautiful what i would call deep caramel color. Bright white head settles to leave a nice, long lasting layer of foam. Nice hoppy nose, faint odors of oak and tobacco, also possibly pears. Taste is very smooth. You can definitely taste the oak, it helps to mellow the characteristic extreme hop bitterness DIPA's usually have. It tastes more like a very hoppy barley wine than a DIPA. Very full bodied and well balanced. Alcohol gives a bit of bite to the back of the throat, but the overall smoothness brought about by the oak aging mellows it substantially."
"One of my very favorite beers. Pours a nice orange-copper color with lots of fine streams of bubbles. Aroma is somewhat lacking. Flavor of sweet grapefruit and maybe a little pineapple throughout, oak, some caramel, with a nice crisp, only moderately bitter aftertaste. Despite the less-than-typical hoppiness, this year's blend reminds me more of Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA and seemed to have a little less oak character than last year's batch, but that's a nit. Highly recommended."
"Carbonation is neither here nor there. The few bubbles rise extremely slow, almost hanging in suspention, and are a blast to watch every time I stir the glass. This one could be a real challange at room temp...I'd recommend it straight from the fridge and let it warm slowly over the course of enjoying for 45 min or so. There are more drinkable challanging big beers out there, but this one is quite nice. Cheers to DFH!"
"Overall: Truely an excellent beer, simple but original concept from the guys at DFH. Although the presence of the 90 min ipa is very strong, still an interesting and incredibly enjoyable brew. At 4 bucks a pop, it is a rare treat to be sipped and enjoyed with friends."
"My favorite style is the DIPA, this beer is unlike any other DIPA I've had. But it is an excellent beer and one I'll definitely come back to."
"Finishes sweet and very warm; reminiscent of rum soaked fruitcake. Overall not what one would consider a well balanced DIPA, but still a solid and unique beer well worth exploring."
"This would be an odd IPA, let alone double IPA. I would have guessed barley wine would be a much better style category. But it's very characterful and tasty regardless."
"Well balanced. A blend of their 90min and something oak aged although I couldn't taste any of the barrel aging. Very fine brew."
"The first time I tried this beer I hated it. I waited to review it this time and have realized that it just wasn't what I expected. I should have known better what to anticipate because this is just like all the other big DFH beers, strong and malty sweet. It's not bad, but not great either, just drink it slow and it will grow on you."
"Perfectly clear copper appearance. Slender white bubbly head. Lace is sporadic and web like. Pretty nice aroma and quite unique actually. Nice fresh hop flower aromas, but not like a West Coast DIPA. This is a little more fragrant perhaps but also mutated into something totally different by the presence of the oak barrel traits. It's all good. Upon first tasting this, I realize that this beer has got some character. Very rich malt base of nougat and caramel and toffee. Pretty sweet actually. (But that's not out of the realm for DFH and DIPAs. See 120minute for example.) Layered on top of the decadent maltiness is some spiked fruit punch character and some oakiness. Hoppy?? Not really. Bitter?? No. Good?? Yes!! Very..."
"Drink it."
"Pours a medium brown with a short head that fades fairly quickly but leaves decent lacing. The aroma is of bitter hops, oak, and sweet malt. Very balanced. The flavors are amazing. Perfectly balanced oak, sweet malt, and hops again. The hops are bitter, earthy, and piney. There are also flavors of candy sugar, a chewiness from the malt, maple, and charred oak. A little on the sweet side, but the oak tannins and hops both balance the flavors. The mouthfeel is just the right body for the flavors, and mostly creamy with a touch of tannins. This is one great beer. Its definitely a sipper, but its so delicious you can't help wanting more."
"Nice mouthfeel, creamy and full. Drinkability is not so good because of the sweetness and the warming alcohol. Not a bad beer, but not one I'll be buying again."
"Overall I had very high expectations for this one; perhaps too high. It is a solid brew, and certainly worth trying, but it was too sweet for my tastes, and the oak-aged IPA didn't come through strongly enough. Personally, I'll take the 90 Minute over this one just because it's a more balanced beer. But this is still solid. Just a bit disappointing."
"Again the syrupy sweetness detracts from the drinkability of this brew in my opinion. That being said, this would make a fine desert beer, and would likely pair very nicely with grilled pork, vanilla ice cream or peach deserts. Its a nice beer that im grateful to have tried. Not going to rush out and try to get my hands on more, but probably will in due time if the opportunity arises."
"Overall a very good and interesting beer. I've never had an oak-aged double IPA, and thought that the two wouldn't go well together. But, there is the perfect amount of oak, and it balances the beer very well. Too bad it's so expensive."
"As I said at the start this was hard for me to catagorize. It was cold and windy out and this was a great warmer up. I actually liked the sweetness but can only handle one at a time."
"D - Very enjoyable - gets much better as it warms. Just be careful about the alcohol - it really creeps up."
"d - highly drinkable, it goes down quickly."
"I'm not the kind of drinker who puts on my jammies and crawls into bed in a fetal position at the first sign of a beer buzz, so with that said: hey DOGFISH! Is a 12-pack too much to ask?"
"D - I could go for a second, if only I wasn't suddenly feeling so poor after the first..."
"O.K as a desert beer, but I couldnt drink more than one."
"Opinion: This beer is some experience, so Sam didn't disappoint us with this one. I am quite surprised at how drinkable this beer is for being what it is. Though it has some huge body in there, the alcohol and carbonation make it a lot easier to drink. The reserved bittering hops are also welcome to me so that it doesn't end up harsh and chalky on the back of the throat. This beer is pretty velvety and easy to drink now. If one were to age it, I would do so in the cooler than at room temp as you don't want any oxidation taking this beer over. The fruitiness is plenty already from the hops, so you just want the age to meld the flavors rather than adding its own complexity. You can't drink this beer much, but I would recommend it."
"D- If it was my tongue alone I would love this beer all day. But the alcohol isn't very well masked, and the sweetness can be too much at times."
"If there's one thing Dogfish Head does well, it's IPAs. And this is no exception. The oak-aging completely transforms this beer. Certainly the maltiest, sweetest IPA I've ever had."
"In all, has held up to half a decade better than most IPAs could dream of, but not too surprising given the stats on it. No weird off-flavours, only a loss of hops and a gain of malt complexity. Interesting as an experiment, totally worth the wait, but I'm increasingly convinced that the sweet spot for this brew is 9-18 months of age."
"the flavor is malty, carmelized malt, spice, little peppery, hop sack, resin, bourbon , and a hint of oak, with a warming of alcohol."
"Wow, Dogfish does it again! A fantastic blend of a strong ale & their IPA products that is a perfect blend of both."
"This is quite different from the 90/60 minute. I don't know how they made it 10% as it's downright evil in how well it hides its alcohol content. There's a lot of sugar in this so if you don't like beers on the sweet side, it's going to disagree with your palate. The more I drink it, the more the taste doesn't agree with me. It's got a very herb-like aftertaste that doesn't mix well with the initial sweetness. I'm really have a hard time finding the hops in what's supposed to be a double IPA. Mouthfeel is a bit weak and watery at the end.This was one of those beers where the first sip was the best...better to save it for a 1 oz tasting."
"Drinkability: Not really one of which I'd have more than one at a time."
"Medium to full body, with fairly mild carbonation. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Balance is quite good, and there is evident alcohol warming. I'm not sure what to make of this beer. I don't get any of the citrusy hops the label/website makes you think you'll find, and I really had to let it warm up before I started getting the vanilla notes. It's certainly not a bad beer, and is actually pretty interesting....but to me it's nothing like what I was expecting. It's a nice mellow, warming beer...would be great in the winter. Very drinkable, but high ABV keeps it from being sessionable."
"Overall Impression: Ive heard this described as a 105 minute IPA, a middle ground between the 90 and 120. Its not too far off. Its a happy middle ground. Just a great beer, glad to see it here in Texas!"
"The first time I drank this I thought it was really a barleywine. The second time I think I had a better feel for what they were going for. The beer is orange and has a small, short white head. The taste is similar to 90 minute but sweeter. In fact, too sweet for me. I could not taste any oak at all (or much hops for that matter)."
"I always seem to have a hard time reviewing DFH because of their take on brew are a bit extreme. Which is a good thing. Burton Baton left me wondering if this is true DIPA. Poured a clear amber hue with a very small off white almost cream head. The head was virtually gone and left no lace on glass. The sweet aroma of malt was overpowered by the ester scent of alcohol. The flavor was surprisingly sweet and not very hoopy at all. I had trouble tasting the caskwood (oak). The funny thing is that I could drink this brew all night long, very smooth, medium to full body, syrupy and softly carbonated the way I enjoy them. I wish it was more bold in flavor."
"Overall a fantastic beer, although not quite what I expected from a Double IPA. It's easy to drink, sweet and well-balanced. Dogfish Head has another winner on their hands; now if only they could lower the price and make it available to the masses!"
"A slow sipper. I took my time and allowed it to warm up a little before finishing it off. A nice beer, but I'll probably put some away and try again in a year."
"Pours out a shimmering, viscous apricot with scant bubbles slowly rising to the top. Head starts off thin, which then settles to a thin ring leaving a few hairs of lace. The smell starts off with honey sweetness and pine resin which follows into vanilla aromas from the oak and the citrus aspect of the hops. Some alcohol is present but it isn't overbearing. Its like smelling a liquified custard of vanilla and orange zest. In the flavor, the 90 Minute certainly comes out more, in terms of the hops. The other beer this is mixed with brings on a lot of honey sweetness with dulled oak tones which are then mingled with the citrus hops. Finish is sweet with a closing bitterness from the hops and a bit of an off-putting medicinal-like alcohol quality. Too sweet. Mouthfeel is warming, slick, and heavy, with mild carbonation. Really, an interesting beer, but not wholly drinkable. The alcohol and sweetness needs to mellow out quite a bit."
"Brilliantly crystal clear, orange brown color with garnet shimmer in the right light. No noticable head but appreciable lacing. Smell is hops & spice - citrus, cinnamon, pine, licorice, sweet caramel malt. Taste is all dogfish. Heavy heavy malt, almost a honeyness to it. Very complicated taste. Reminds me of Raison d'etre at first. Hops are there but not as dominant or even as playful as a standard IPA. This isn't a 90-min recipe redone. Seems like they're going for more class here. It works too. The betas are present here - there's a bit of medicine and a sharp dryness. Whisky. Maple. Charcoal. Also some bubblegum, but that vanishes fast. Mouthfeel is sharp bubble and a bit too sticky."
"Overall, this is a """DIPA""" in the same vein as Founders Devil Dancer. It pushes the limits of the DIPA style to where it merges into a barley wine. A complex and nicely balanced strong ale from Dogfish Head."
"I simply do not understand DFH's love affair with oak."
"Very dry and creamy leaves a sugary coating all over the palate. A sipper for sure,had a hard time finishing a bottle a bit too sugary for me overall, would be an interesting beer to age."
"Excellent beer mix."
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a copper color with a small off-white head. Lacing is OK. The beer smells like citrus and oak, with an overall sweet hoppy smell. It tastes very sweet, like toffee, vanilla, pepper (spice) and citrus (grapefruit). There's just a slight bitter aftertaste, but overall it's a very sweet beer. Not quite what I expected, not that it's a bad thing. The mouthfeel is medium, and it's a smooth beer. Drinkability is good, but it's a little too sweet for me but the beer does go down easy, and it has just the right amount of carbonation to make it good. It's just a bit too sweet for me to drink more than one at a time. I think it's a good dessert beer. Also, the 10% ABV isn't noticable at all. I'd buy it again, and I'd recommend it to others to try."
"Too strong for my tastes but still a nice try at a double IPA. Russian River, where are you when I need you?"
"12 oz. bottle, 10 % ABV. Very clear copper in color. Appears to be a lot of active carbonation. Thick off-white rocky head. Excellent head retention. Citrusy aroma, a bit fruity and woodsy. Very sweet up front, and a bit fruity. Nice citrust hop bite, which seems to be somewhat balanced by the malt. A bit of oak character in the background. Great patches of lace coating the sides of the glass. Nice body. The sweetness kills the drinkability for me. Some lingering bitterness, but the sweetness remains. Alcohol seems well hidden. Not bad, could age well I suppose."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a laser printed brewed on date on the neck. Was a rich copper color with a finger of head that slowly dissipated to a constant foam with some lacing. The aroma was hoppy but not as much as you'd expect in an ADIPA. It was really dominated by a sweetness that was quite surprising in it's intensity. I expected some sense oak aged but wow. The taste was unusual to say the least. Again not what I'd expect for an ADIPA. The sweetness was overpowering at first and then just too much to deal with as I made my way thru it. Gotta say I don't like this one very much. Out of balance and out of style. Not a drain pour but damn close. Now I gotta figure out what to do with the other 3 I have. (2.5, NA, ML, N)"
"States on the bottle that """this beer ages with the best of 'em""" and I'm planning on taking the other 3 down to my stash in the storage room to try in a year or two."
"Purchased at whole foods thanks to Kim, chilled and poured into a tulip glass. Creamy coconut flesh colored head appeared about two centimeters thick with nice clump lacing. The body is a dark, ruby (strawberry), amber color with purple shades (like iced tea) and visible bubbles maintaining the head. The smell is an aromatic blend of caramel malts, toffee, and a tinge of vanilla from the oak. Hops, Im going to venture a guess, but maybe tettnanger, cascade and something else for bittering. Needless to say there is a nice hop bouquet, not as forward as I thought it would be though, yet it expresses that sort of light tropical character. Notes of alcohol are present as it warms; yet they are not in any way a deterrent. Flavor wise I get toffee, notes of honey, deeply fermented malt and I can almost taste maple syrup and even hints of mint. At moments I also detect something not unlike an orange liqueur. As it warms it can almost seem abrasive, but it is still quite palatable just the same. Personally there is something fall like to this brew. I very much enjoyed this, however it is definitely not something to loose your head over,add one another slightly risqué, yet tasty brew from Dogfish Head."
"A great sipper, but not for everyday. This is a barleywine, dammit!"
"D - Overall a very plesant beer, supprisingly devoid of the excessive use of hops that sometimes comes with a I2PA. The very heavy mouthfeel and percieved alcohol makes it seem more like a barleywine than anything else. Quite a good beer, but the 12oz that I had was all that I would want in one sitting."
"The mouth is light, but weighed down by the cloying sweetness. It's a bit overwhelming, which renders it not very drinkable. Not bad, but a little too sweet and medicinal--ultimately, it's not worth the price."
"Very impressive! Possibly the best DFH I've sampled. Certainly the most drinkable. Very comparable to Stone 10th Anniversary in many ways. An intense experience here."
"Pours a dark red body with an off-white head that stuck around nicely. The smell was largely of citrusy, floral hops with notes of vanilla and oakiness. The taste smacked hard of hops at first but then opened up to a huge strong malty backbone. The oakiness was also very noticable in the taste. The mouth feel was slightly sticky finishing with a long bitter finish. This beer was mighty tastey but I don't think I could drink more then one in a sitting."
"Drinkability is good for a brew of this style, the aging helps tremendously in this respect. Main concern is the high alcohol content."
" Palate is a nice, mellow blend of sweet malt and deep, fruity hops. The aging has mellowed the sharp hoppiness of the 90 Minute very well, and the barrel-aged component certainly helps to smoothe things out. Some mild heat from the alcohol comes through on the finish, with a strong vanilla-bourbon flavor right at the end. Body is smooth and just a tad sticky, which is to be expected for a 10+% beer. Very approachable and drinkable for a strong, complex ale. I'm a big fan."
"D - Very drinkable. I wish I had this in a bomber. Neither the hops nor the malt are overwhelming, which makes it very easy to drink. It's so smooth that you drink it faster than expected. I had to slow down. This is yet another great brew from Dogfish. Similar to the 90-minute but not at all similar in the same respect."
"Flavor has a myriad of complexities ranging from fruit to wood to the background of 90 minute this brew is blended with. Mouthfeel is smooth and lush with a satisfying carbonation and finish. Drinkability is somewhat hampered by the alcohol and the flavors can get cloying as the brew warms IMO, but these are but minor quibbles when a beer has this good a taste. Another interesting brew from a great brewery."
"This beer is a bit pricey, but worth a try. The great hop characters are complimented nicely with a rich sweetness I assume comes from the oak conditioning. Out of the 10 of us that split the 4 pack it was a dead split between love it and hate it, hopefully you have the chance to try one too."
"At the end of this 2nd sample I added a touch of their IBA and liked it alot better. I wonder how good a mix of their BB and 120 would be."
"Many thanks to MuenchenerKindl for sending me this one."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but sweet aftertaste will probably hinder some drinkers."
"D - Definetely a sipping beer. I imagine even someone who is a big fan of this beer won't want more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Exellent flavors and balance make this a highly drinkable brew for me. Truly unique. Very good buy for the price. Delicious!"
"Pours an orangish amber color with a thin white head with good retention that sticks all over the sides of the glass. The aroma is malt, a floral sweetness, bubblegum, vanilla and alcohol. Taste is creamy with a nice maltiness in the beginning that is followed with a flowery and fruitiness with the hops rounding out the finish and some warming from the alcohol. You can also pick up on the influences from the oak as well in the taste. Overall, this is another solid offering from DFH. Not something I would drink every night, but it certainly is interesting enough to revisit again. Recommended."
"D- It is good but it is not a hop assault I was expecting. It is well balanced and almost more on the side of an American barleywine. It is a sipper but in my eyes that is never a bad thing."
"This is a nice once in a while sipper but not a beer that I'd drink often. Even though it's not an everyday beer, I'd still say it's a must try."
"Cheers!"
"as if i didnt feel this way before, but i would try anything this brewery puts out"
"Taste is definately sweet, with citrus and velvety malts bursting through. Strong alcohol notes as well. Only a slight amount of hop action here, but it's a nice surprise. Mouthfeel is lush and juicy, amost """starburst""" in its texture. Very smooth across the palate with a sweet aftertaste. Overall this beer is complex and tasty, but the strong alcohol content paired with a powerful sweetness make it tough to imagine having more than one in a single sitting (not to mention the price!)."
"The taste followed the same route with the huge candy sweetness predominating some other hints of apple, cherries, grapes. Some alcohol, but it is mostly balanced by the rebost flavors. Goes down very smooth, light and crisp. Tingles and warms as it goes. Carbonation is not overally done though. Overall this is a very nice brew, a little too sweet to have more then one or two, but is perfect as a sipper after dinner. Really a good sweet dessert, very nicely done, and at 10%abv, should be a nice sipper anyway!"
"Poured into a Duvel glass, copper color with smallish head and some lacing on the glass. Smell is more of liquor and vanilla and less of the citric hops of the DFH90. Some vanilla in the flavor and the hops are not as upfront, but still there. Sweeter than the 90 minute and more mellow for sure. I'll cellar a couple of these to see what happens to them. This beer is a definite treat, different enough from the other DIPA's one that I will make a point to revisit every year."
"DFH seem to be a brewery that takes their ipas damn seriously. I have had the 60,90, and 120, but now Burton Baton comes along. Poured from the bottle (with a really cool looking label) into a cisco brewery pint glass a nice enough looking copper color, with a small white lace at the top.Smell was the highlight for sure, with some gummi berry smells, some chardonnay, and a bit of vanilla. Taste was big on the sweet side. The vanilla from the oak barrels really pulls through, making it a much smoother, and sweeter ipa then it's numbered brothers. Hops were there, but in back of the sweet flavors. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy, and not exactly highly drinkable. The sweet tastes seem to overwhelm everything. While this might be one of the most interesting ipa's i have tried in a long time, i did not think it was something that i could come back to all the time. I will continue to stick with the 90 minute. Either way, I applaud calagione and company trying something new and cool. Cheers"
"Overall, this one is a little sweeter than other DIPAs, where the flavor is the focus rather than the extreme bitterness. Since this is a mix of an aged DIPA and a young DIPA, the sweetness is more pronounced. The high %ABV (10%) is well hidden, so don't get carried away. A 12oz bottle is ideal for one sitting, however you may want to tackle the 750 with a friend."
"12 oz pour into a nice English pub glass with the dimpled bottom that encouraged a tornadic production of a giant head from the fury of bubbles in the bottom of the glass. Shiny reddish-orange. Its like a vision of heaven in a glass. This has the syrupy goodness of the 90-minute, but with an added syrupiness ... robust and smooth, like a desert sauce, you could pour this over a bowl of vanilla ice cream instead of a caramel sauce, with its own french vanilla creaminess ... the ONLY thing that detracts here is an odd light metallic twinge at the finish that didnt seem to fit. Otherwise, this is a beaut of a big beer with a light profile. Well done Dogfish! (#2703, 2/14/2007)"
"I tried to drink two of these in a two hour period, and although I succeeded, it was not easy. This beer wasn't at all disappointing, just a little too sweet for me. I'll save it for the occasions that call for a great dessert beer."
"Average drinkabaility due to the heavy sweet flavor and heavy mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability-This beer goes down very smooth and has a nice feel. It's medium bodied and carbonation is very good. I can't go so far as to say it's a session beer. The sweetness is a little overwhelming. It pushes the envelope in that department. Nonetheless, very drinkable. Overall, this is a very good beer."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beers carbonation lightens the beer up. The thickness of the flavors are very long lasting. The beer wasnt hard to drink. One of these is definately enough for a session."
"Very interesting flavors in this one- Beautiful piney resinous hops on the aroma with some dried fruit undertones. This brew is thick, nice syrupy sweetness from the casked ale, slight spice from the barrel. Very obvious hop profile, oily on the tongue, but not too bitter in the aftertaste- very nice melding and interesting flavors. Hopefully dogfish will go even further with the IPA in the future."
"The taste was divine - a caramel overtone with hoppy, bitter undertones, all balanced to perfection. This beer is incredibly drinkable, especially considering the high alcohol content. One of the finest dogfish head beers I've ever had."
"Overall this is instantly one of my favorite beers. I would like a little bit more head, and it might be a bit too sweet for some, but those are the only flaws I can see. A damned fine brew from one of the great American breweries."
"Bottled on 1/08/07"
"Notes: I believe this bottle's been in my cellar for about 14 months. I drank one when it was fresh and it's my recollection (I didn't review it at the time) that it was more harsh all around. It seems to have mellowed quite nicely in the year or so in the cellar. . . . A note on the style: it's misleading to call this a DIPA. I believe it's a 50/50 blend, with their 90 Minute DIPA making up just one half of the equation. In taste, it's lacking the hop assault most of us expect from a DIPA. In many ways it seems to be more like a barleywine. Whatever you call it, I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it as a night-time sipper, especially on a cold night."
"Probably one of my favorite DFH brews."
"Have to admit I had this last year and really didn't care for it. Well this years to me is a night and day difference and one of the better tasting beers I've had in a long....long time. Rich sweet vanilla, meringue, oak. Nuts again with more dried fruits. Nicely hopped with again earthy type of resiny buds. RS is much higher than anticipated. Very chewy, and gummy mouthfeel. Delicious, almost a dessert drink. Huge, complex, and in your face."
"FWIW - I would give them higher props if they would also step beyond the current hop craze marketing and use their rep and brews like this to bring other styles to the forefront. Instead, they lump this in the IPA hop craze category. Of course I don't have to sell this beer in hopes of making a profit so it's only my .02."
"This beer is fairly drinkable, but not fantastic. I find it too sweet, almost barleywine-like. It is nice from time to time, but I wouldn't be interested in drinking many of them in one sitting."
"Really great brew from DFH. This doesn't seem like a DIPA to me, but whatever style it is, it's good. Great variation of the 90 min in my opinion. Just wish this wasn't so pricey."
"The alcohol isn't noted in the mouth, but it is quite evident on the ride down. I could easily enjoy one more. The smell rating is going to skew my total score lower than my overall satisfaction with the product. I plan on buying another 4 pk and squirrel it away for the barbecue season."
"NOTE - This actually becomes a great nightcap sipper if left open for a while. It numbs the gums, and it should have a little more definition. This could only pair with a cigar."
"I'm not sure if this should be labeled a double IPA, to me there's a enough malt backbone here to classify it as an American strong ale. Those looking for a big hop bomb may be disappointed. This is one fantastically complex brew, and truly a pleasure to drink. Love it."
"12oz brown bottle from Florian's. Dark copper-red translucent body with a half an inch of light tan head. Hops dominate the aroma though there's a generous dallop of malt to support - reminds me of 90 minute but with more malt. Tastes hoppy and sweet, with vanilla, alcohol and a hint of metalic twang. A bit lighter bodied than expected with a bit of syrupyness to it, though not thick enough to be sticky. Becomes more balanced as I get more used to it. Fairly drinkable for the ABV. Not a bad beer, though I think I'll be sticking with the 90 minute (or 60 minute for that matter)."
"This is not an easy beer to drink. It's a heavy, brutal brew. If this were a beer drinking video game, this brew would be the final """Boss.""" Insane. It is way beyond what I consider enjoyable drinking. Glad I only bought one. To me, this is the exact example of what happens when good beer goes Imperial. It's just overwhelming for the sake of being overwhelming."
"I don't know about double IPA, by bottle reminded me a lot more of an American strong ale (which is blended into the beer with 90 min). There was a big, sweet malt presence, even a little syrupy and that's just too much for anything that's in the IPA family. Still, it was a pretty good beer, but like some of the dogfish beers i've tried, the flavor profile reminds me of a wine's flavor in that it's rich with very subtle flavors. I got random hints of wood (oak) out of this along with citrus hop notes. Worth a try, but a bit spendy."
"Pours perfectly clear, with a measured, bright, off-white head that leaves a dusting of bubbles on the surface and a collar around the edges. The color is a dark shade of amber with brown highlights. The nose isn't quite what I expected from the description on the bottle -- it's much less hoppy than I thought it would be. Instead, the vanilla notes are very powerful and backed by a grainy malt note that I usually associate with brown ales or possibly alt biers. On the palate, the first sensation is a huge oaky sweetness; it's a big, juicy, fruity (strawberry?) and vanilla sweetness. At first the sweet notes are nice, but they start to get cloying at the mid-palate and in the finish. The trouble is that the palate isn't composed of a whole lot other than that sweetness; it's unbalanced by bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and a bit heavy, with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a sweet-bomb with some nice characteristics and smoothness, but it's not worth the high price tag."
"Overall, very enjoyable; I'll be picking up more of this if it's still available."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer ever since NC relaxed it's beer law regarded alcohol content. I missed out on it last year, so as soon as I saw some on the shelves in 2007, I eagerly picked up a couple of 4-packs. The beer poured a brilliant amber color with a small wispy head that left some lacing on the glass. There was lots of malty sweetness in the aroma along with some notes of honey and spicy hops. Being a DIPA, I expected a lot more hop in the aroma. Taste was quite sweet and malty with some notes of maple syrup, grape, vanilla and oak. Hop flavor was there, but didn't really stand out until the beer got closer to room temp. Alcohol was very well hidden. Drinkability was good for a high alcohol brew. I was expecting a hop bomb and never got it. This beer reminds me alot of DFH's Olde School barleywine. It's very sweet and the hops never go over board. It's a good beer, but not in the DIPA category as stated on the bottle."
"Taste is also dominated by the vanilla/oak wood flavors. We begin with sweet malt followed up with a smooth oak that brings us to a mildly warming alcohol finish. The heavy carbonation helps balance out the sweet malt here for an impressively drinkable double. While the 10% is detectable, it isn't offensive and fits in nicely to the many flavors of Burton Baton."
"Very drinkable, especially for the big ABV. The sweetness is mildly distracting, but the depth of flavor will keep you coming back for more. Definitely mis-categorized as a DIPA, this beer more closely resembles an English barleywine (if anything)."
"From the 1/08/07 batch, poured into a belgian snifter. Appears a bright amber/orange color with thick, creamy two-finger head. Some thinnish lacing left along the glass as the beer recedes. The smell is sweet, with notes of oak and hops and citrus and pepper. The taste really packs a punch. Crazy malted citrus flavor up front. Think of a juiced-up half-grapefruit, half-raisin on steroids; it strikes under the tongue extremely sharp. But unlike most double IPAs that I've had, the hops never really develop in the finish. I kept waiting for them to attack the back of the tongue and throat, but they never did. The malty sweetness of the beer is almost too overwhelming here, almost syrupy at times; it needs a higher dose of hops (and I've NEVER said that about any DFH brews before) to counter the malt and the oak here. They just seem to take the reigns early, and never really give back control to the hops. Too bad, too, because the Burton Baton has a lot of potential. Still, it's not a bad brew. I've got one in the cellar that I plan on giving a go in about a few months, maybe a year."
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. A nice looking beer, amber hues and a light tan foamy head. Sticky lacing. The hops smell sweet and piny at the same time. The taste is quite interesting: The two IPA's being blended both show themselves separately. Up front there is a smooth but resiny taste then it transitions into a full bodied, bold, and almost malty sweet double IPA. The oak takes any kind of edge off of this strong brew. The end of it is the best part with it's almost caramelized, super-sweet taste removing any chance of alcohol burn."
"This is a good slow sipping after dinner treat that could last the better part of an evening....and at $17 a 4-pack, you shouldn't rush this one."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured a nice thick yellowish head that fades slowly to a film leaving some curtains of lace. Sweet juicy hop aroma. Sweet malt flavor similar to a double bock, but then it's joined by flavorful West Coast hops. Thick mouthfeel is on it's way to being syrupy. Tons of flavor, but almost too sweet. I think two of these is my limit."
"Overall, a pretty good and (as always) interesting offering from the people at Dogfish Head. It's far from a session beer, or even its easier drinking high alcohol peers from the Belgian family, but definitely worth a good tasting."
"Drinkability: I just wish it wasn't so sweet... Limits drinkability for me, personally, but I enjoyed all that I had."
"Love the color. Very intriguing. Rich, deep orange, unfiltered. The head retention is amazing considering we have been saving this bottle for over a year. The smell is complex and bold for the style. You get a lot of malt up front followed by a hint of citrus. The nose is much bolder than the initial taste. (If the nose was indeed the taste, this would be even more amazing.) For a 10% ABV it's very drinkable. One of my favorite aspects of the flavor is the hint of buttermel, that's right buttermel - that's wosion (woo-shun) (word fusion) of Butterscotch and Caramel... especially present in the aftertaste. One of the few problems is the mouthfeel. This beer just doesn't want to waste time sitting in your mouth... it wants to go to it's home... deep down into my belly."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy beige color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is pretty interesting. Taste is an interesting mix between light oak flavour and some sweet malt reminiscent of a barley wine with some honey and very little hops. Body is above average with low filtration and great carbonation. This is not what I was expected since it is more reminiscent of a barley wine then an IIPA but it was very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Good amout of head and a golden rich golden pour. Strong whiskey notes. I had this in a snifter which allowed for a real distinct whiskey aroma. My only complaint is that toward the end of this beer the alcohol taste became more intense. Since I would consider this a true sippin beer by the end it tasted very strong. Overall one of my all time favorites and what turned me on to oak aged beers."
"D - Being 10% is the only downfall, and its not even really a downfall except in this category. Aaron, you are a freakin saint for sending me this delectable piece of brewed art."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a hazy orangish color. There was a bit of an off-white head that drops off quickly and leaves no lacing. This has an interesting aroma. It is much more like a Belgian than an Imperial IPA. Caramel, fruitiness and some alcohol to the nose. Perhaps a hint of the oak also. The taste has some caramel sweetness to it, as well a slight citric hop taste, but no real bite like you would expect from an Imperial IPA. I am really enamored by this beer. Hard to really classify, but excellent."
"Thanks to brentk56 for the trade."
"Overall a heavy hitting malty DIPA. Much maltier than I imagined it would be. Suprisingly drinkable though."
"Was really looking forward to this one. Pours a hazy red/brown, thick off white forms, nice lacing, settles to a thin layer and ring. Smell is nice, sweet toffee, vanilla, wood, citrus and floral, really nice. Taste is big toffee and oak, vanila, some chocolate, super malty and bready, exploding with flavour, the oak comes through very nice. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation. This one is strange, not really a double IPA, not really a barleywine but a whole different beast, excellent oaking, fantastic beer. Thanks DrJay!!!"
"The bottled date on this beer was 12/29/05. It poured an amber color with a small white head that quickly disappeared. The nose is piney with a hint of citrus and some biscuit notes hiding in the background. This thing is smooth and creamy, very nice. The bitterness and the sweetness are nicely balanced. The bitterness is piney and the sweetness reminds me of vanilla. When I had this back in January the oak was very prominent, now it is just mixed in with the vanilla, and that is good, I thought it was a little too much then. Very low carbonation smooth and creamy a real after dinner sipping beer."
"Bright orange to ruby red hues in the body. Streams of carbonation are pretty steady, though the head is very light. What was there quickly settled to a ring of slightly toasted white. Very subtle aroma. Mellowed citrusy hops with some light alcohol notes. Taste is like a more refined DFH hopped-up offering. I'm not sure if I'm happy with the masked hops. The hop head in me wants them to come out, but the oakyness that seems to be pulling them down is thoroughly appreciated. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, light carbonation. Easy to drink with the alcohol hardly being noticed. Not your typical DFH experience -- a lot of malt and hop balance. Full of complexity. One of the best DFHs I've had."
"The drinkability is great, I big 10% ABV beer that I would drink all night long. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Clear, deep orange/amber colour toped by a short cap of foam off a vigourous pour. Bubbles were of various sizes and formed a little short-lived lacing. The head dissipated over a few minutes, but left behind a long-lasting collar. Wow! The results of my first sniff were a bit unexpected - and in a good way. There's a really rich malt character with lots of caramel. Notes of vanilla, wood, and alcohol blend well with a muted hop presence. The first sip didn't disappoint either. Initially heavy, nearly syrupy, the sweetness slowly gave way to vanilla, oak, and alcohol - a definite whiskey vibe. Subsequent sips flashed back and forth between strong yet tempered bitterness, rich malty caramel and toffee, faint citrusy hops, and high end whiskey. Each time I went back it was almost like having a different beer. Superb. Full bodied all around, bordering on heavy, with carbonation on the light side. Alcohol warmth was apparent almost throughout, made more pronounced yet retaining some softness due to the oak aging. Unfortunately, this numbed my taste buds a bit after about half a bottle. To me, this was more like a fine old ale rather than a DIPA. Regardless of semantics, this is a sophisticated gem of a beer - truly a work of art."
"Taste is malty, some dark fruit and toffee. Vanilla is stornger here. Strident hops as well but they don't take over and it balances the sweetness. Mouth is still lightly sticky and full bodied. No hint of alcohol in the taste. Very tasty and drinkable. An experiment that works!"
"If you can find it, get it, this beer is awesome."
"D- Although not your typical everyday beer, it was a phenomenal experience and one of the most unique brews I have had the pleasure of trying. Any DIPA fan should seek this out!"
"I'll definitely pick this one up again if I get the chance. Cool beer."
"I remember this beer being more complex and woody when I first bought it. The hops have really subsided (too much IMO). I won't lay this down as long next time."
"An unusual beer but highly satisfying and intriguing."
"Poured a light hazy, copper, color with a medium sized off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Oak, citrus hops, sweet bubblegum, and the signature DFH yeast aroma. Taste was very oaky, with citrus hops, toffee, vanilla and a touch of alcohol in the finish."
"D - Very drinkable. This is a totally different DIPA than any that I have ever had in the past, kinda tastes like a Beligian Strong Dark Ale. I've never had a oaked aged DIPA, that could be the difference. Not hoppy at all, but very tasty, highly recommended."
"This is a unique and tasty beer."
"Mellow soft mouthfeel with caramel sweet overtones coupled with rich ripe tropical fruits. Oaked accents are detectable, but where are the hops? How is this a DIPA? Don't get me wrong, this is delicious, and highly drinkable, but I think it's categorized incorrectly."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, appearance is a beautiful slightly hazy reddish orange, with the thinnest off white head that rapidly dissipated to a faint rim of sticky whitish lacing that doesn't cling to the glass. Aroma smells sweet and warmly of alcohol, malt and caramel, woody and earthy undertones present. Taste is sweet and malty, slight hop presence as the sweetness fades. Smoother than silk, by far the smoothest Double IPA I've ever had. Excellent all around, medium body paired with low levels of carbonation, slightest tingle on the tongue. Leaves a slightly dry and bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is dangerously high, another smooth criminal from the good folks at Dogfish Head, the 10% abv is there, but practically hidden under the sweet and smooth qualities of this excellent beer."
"Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed this beer but I think it would be difficulty to appreciate more than one in a sitting, might even be a good idea to share the bottle with someone."
"D: Very interesting beer. Certainly doesn't fall in line with other IPA's but intriguing none the less. I couldn't drink another one, much too sweet and cloying. If I drink this beer again, I'll share the bottle with someone."
"Really a nice beer here - one well worth keeping in the cellar to pull out for special occasions."
"12-ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Burnt copper with steady carbonation rivulets and a meaty and serene manilla foam cap. Citrusy hop aromas blend with a sour, almost funky malt and mineral scent. Huge bitterness, like Chinooks or something on a thick bed of malts spiked through with ferrous metal flavors. Citrus pith lingers in the aftertaste, while alcohol warms from the belly upwards. 10% abv is pretty huge, and the interesting flavor profile valiantly struggles to stay in front of it. I think this is about a year old, but the alcohol has not quite finished melding yet. Medium-thick mouthfeel with prickly alcohol slickness. Not syrupy, which is good, but still too hot to be considered really drinkable. Oaky dryness emerges midway through. Interesting stuff for sure, and truly cool label artwork."
"Drinkability: Just the 10% alcohol along makes this nearly impossible. The balance of malt to hop is not correct for the style. Its a solid offering and a wonderful attempt. I would imagine this beer is best left to age for a few years."
"The beer tasted distinctively sweet yet mild at first blush but soon blossomed in the mouth to a very full flavor. Smooth for a hoppy beer, the oaky, roasted, molasses flavors were not overcome by the liberal brightness of the hops. The balance was remarkable. This is a beer for all seasons and all situations. Outstanding."
"Drinkability: down for me as this is a one beer per session brew. Very tasty but tends to overload tastebuds near the end. Very interesting beer."
"The rich oak tones come through immeadiatly. The smoothe sweetness follows with other hints of candied fruits. The taste of honey comes out right away and the incredible smoothe qualities follow. I wondered where the hops were but I guess the aging in oak mellows them out substantially and leaves the behind their flavor profiles. I really enjoyed this and will probably pick up a few more."
"Thanks to beerbeing!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Good looking cream colored head a finger high. Good lacing. Dark amber color. Smell is a bit on the malty side and sweet. This is my first DIPA, so I'm not sure if this is to be expected. There is some hops, but very mellow. The taste is fantastic. If this is the norm for DIPA, then I want more. It is spicy, smokey, and woody, which must be from the oak-aging. There is a pleasant alcohol warmth to the taste. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and chewy. It feels very rich, so I wouldn't want to drink too many of these at once, but I would love to get more."
"Overall, rather disappointing. Burton Baton might even be mis-cast as a DIPA, IMO. This brew simply lacks the one essential necessary to fall into that style: hops. I'll stick with DFH's 90 Min IPA, thanks. There are many other DIPA's I'd rather spend my time and money on over this offering."
"I don't know if I could write a bad review of this beer if my life depended on it. I've been meaning to try this forever but am only now doing so. Pour is heartstoppingly beautiful scarlett orange. Tiny nappy head and little lacing. Nose is cognac, fruit, and warm caramel. This reminds me of Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Barleywine ... on steroids. Mouth is thick and viscous. I LOVE this beer, which is easily the best DFH beer I've ever had. Do NOT drink this if you lust for a double IPA, do so if you'd like a Barleywine. It will hit the spot and make all but the greatest it's BITCH."
"This an OK drinkable beer but I am confused, shouldn't this have hops in it? Disappointing is the only word that fits this beer."
"Drinkability: Burton Baton gets some points here for that lower level of carbonation; it is not a filling beer in that respect, and despite its powerful and complex flavors, a second bottle is not out of the question. At 10% abv, though, some drinkers might have to search for their socks before having a second tipple."
"Drinkability: I like many other Dogfish Head beers better than this, that is not saying it is a bad beer, just that it is not one of my favorites."
" I have to say this is a damned fine brew from our friends in Delaware. I wish it was more readily available. A wee bit heavy, but would be very nice to warm my bones beside the fire."
"The Palate is bold with flowery hop notes, pine, grapefruit, amontillado, toffee and alcohol. Lots of in your face and up your nose alcohol. Things just don't seem to be in balance here. It has a lot of good flavors, but it's not a particularly easy beer to drink."
"Another fine beer from DFH . . . pours a two finger, white head that slowly fades leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet malty/hoppy nose. Starts sweet a lot of malt but balanced with a lot of hops, finish has hints of molasses, high ABV is not noticeable. $3.50 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"It's amazing the brews that DFH comes up with. This one poured out to a dark bronze color with a small head of foam and uniform rings of lace. Nice. Lower level of carbonation. Aroma was heavenly; candied sugary malt and grain, with some dark fruits and yeasty notes. Wow. Taste was very complex and enjoyable; fermented grain, dark fruits, molasses, wood notes, warming alcohol, mild yet solid hops. Nice. Mouthfeel was slick and had a chewy element about itself. Drinkability is fair enough. Not an everyday brew, or even one that fits the term DIPA, but a good beer all the way around. Recommended."
"This beer boasts an appealing orange nearly new copper colour. The head was an edematous pinky's worth of tannish froth until it fell asunder. Lace is cast forth and a steady ring of foam lives on. The bubbles are nice to watch. The nose is super sweet. Normally this would put me off, but this sweetness is strikingly pleasant. The oak qualities come through with some vanilla brilliance. The hop factor seems to be somewhat subdued while the malt character and woody textures flourish. The taste is sweet and sugary. It remains very clean though and avoids the overdone crusty dirtiness that ruins other less fortunate beers. The oak qualities lay some accents on the flavour and truly add benefit. Slight alcoholic heat. Quite nice. I am not quite sure this reminds me of an Imperial IPA in any way however. Looking past labels I am still inclined to say this is a treat. The mouthfeel is thick and slick. It has a bit of a buttery finish as well. The drinkability is good. This beer is an example of one that prospers from barrel aging. Solid. Whatever it is."
"from the bottle. poured a copper amber with a very small light tan head that left a small amount of lacing. aroma malts, with brown sugar all over it a long with hops the alcohol didnt show up until it warmed up a bit, light fruits. flavorthe malts and sweetness comes out nicely the sweetness leans towards honey, hops, fruit semm to be almost like apricot. dry this is a good sipping beer"
"Poured a translucent copper with almost no cap at all. I used a very vigerous pour and got very thin cap that was gone in a few seconds. Aroma was earthy-caramel malts with a floral and citrus nose. Not too strong. Flavor was obvious caramel sweet malts right off. Very nice earthy, pepper and citrus undertones with a little sourness. Alcohol became more apparant as the temperature rose. Medium carbonation with a dry warming finish. This beer hit strong. It didn't take long to feel the effects of the 10% ABV in this one. Very enjoyable to drink!"
"12 ounce bottle. Dogfish Head Burton Baton pours out a partially cloudy amber color topped with a small head. The aroma is toffee and citrusy hops, with occasional whiffs of alcohol. Biscuity malt flavor. Sweet caramel comes in at the middle. Hops are spicy and citrusy. While this beer is quite hoppy, I wouldn't call it a hop bomb. Finishes with piney hop oil flavor. The woodyness is most noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick. Although the alcohol is noticable, drinkability remains high. Great balance for an Imperial IPA."
"To me, this tastes like a beer that got stuck in a zone somewhere between IPA and Belgian (if you can imagine that). It's a nice ale, but should really be categorized for what it is."
"I loved it! For a DIPA, though, very off the beaten path! Pick this one up!"
"Nose is so, so hoppy. Breadyness and some earthy grassy hops come through as well.. Just deliciousness. Taste lets you down some... nowhere near as hoppy and delicious, but it's alright. Mouthfeel is lacking the suds and thin. Drinkable for a 10% beer, and I love DIPAs- but I wish the taste had lived up to the smell."
"The beer pours a dark copper with very little head. Sweet malty aroma with hints of vanilla. My first sip is not at all what I expect, so I try again searching for the hops. This beer tastes much like an eisbock with sweet maltiness riding the strong but balanced alcohol. Hints of vailla come thru in the taste. There is just a hint of bitterness in the background of the finish of the taste, but even this fades as it warms into malty goodness. The beer was medium bodied and the alcohol strength was nicely balanced and left me feeling quite content. A very unique beer from Dogfish Head, not what I was expecting at all, but I was very pleased nonetheless."
"That's what I have to say about that."
"Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than medium, I'd say. Carbonation makes it crisp. Drinkability is okay. This one is a sipper and not an easy to quaff DIPA like many others. Alcohol is definately noticable on the stomach. I'd love to have this again, just not tonight. A super-unique brew that is quite a bit different than the usual west-coast hop bombs. I like..."
"Nice and drinkable. Definately need to grab one to cellar for another taste in the future."
"Brilliantly clear (filtered) amber with a slightly tan thick head that fills my pint glass. I can smell cloyingl sweet maltiness topped with abrasive hop bitterness. Smells exactly like I expect any DFH IPA to smell, and tastes almost exactly as I expected as well. Cloying syrupy/caramelly sweetness leads the way. A slightly less than balanced bittering makes this hard to qualify as a DIPA IMO. Oak aging is barely evident. Moderate to full body is enjoyable with the right amount of carbonation. Good beer, but not as good as I was hoping for, I think it needs more hops and oak. Since it is 10%, and not what I expected, the drinkability suffered a bit, but I would consider this beer again if I was looking for a sweet slightly hoppy ale, but I might be more likely to pick up 90min."
"Okay - this is 10%. Yes, I've mentioned alcohol several times in this review. However, I will go on record as saying this is one of the easiest to drink strong ales I've had in recent memory. Case in point: Double Bastard. Also 10%. That brew is positively evil. It's evil (delicious evil) in a bottle. I had to drink that Bastard very, very slow. This, on the other hand, is a drinker. This is a pussycat all the way down into your belly, where it turns into a monster. I could easily drink a 4-pack of this at a go."
"Thanks Clvand0."
"Another great brew by the always evolving Dogfish Head."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, warm malty scent that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with an intensely bitter hop aroma. There is a slight oakey aroma that adds balance to this powerful brew. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down slow and warm and finishes bitter and a bit sweet. It has a rich malt flavor as well as their traditional continually hopped taste. It's unique from anything I've ever tried. The oak aging provides a buffer from the high alcohol and adds a nice balance to the taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey beer, but not the best Dogfish Head offers. I like the concept, but the 120 IPA is better. Still, this is a good drinking beer, at a slow pace."
"D: Alcohol flavors develop more while the beer warms and you drink more of it. This is a sipping beer and one that you enjoy one of a night. I personally liked this much more than the 90 Minute, so if you enjoy that I would recommend giving this a try. A very well balanced beer."
"Not really an IPA...more of a complex oak aged strong ale of some kind. Pretty impressive nevertheless - another interesting beer from DFH. Probably worth aging some more..."
"D - Nice unique take on an IPA but a little too much vanilla/Sweetness for my tastes. I am going to have to let the other one I have age for a while and revisit."
"Complex. Surprising - not what I expected at all. There certainly may be an imperial ipa in the bottle, but the barrel aging has, to my tastes, moved this to American Strong Ale or Barleywine. Whatever it ended up, it's a good and interesting beer."
"One of my favorite Dogfish Head beers (and that says a lot). Burton Baton is the clasic Dogfish IPA combined with the full flavor of an oak-aged ale. Appearnce is dark, and pours without much head. Has a nice earthy, slightly malty taste without much bitterness or excessive hops. Oak and alcohol flavors are prominent, and it goes down beautifully for a 10% abv. beer. My overall impression of the beer after a few tastes were of a nice barleywine, but it gets more complex as you continue to sip. I have fond memories of drinking this beer on the deserted January Delaware beachfront, and after revisiting it I can say that it lived up to my high expectations. Just don't try to drive afterwards."
"The best way to catagorize Burton Baton is that its the perfect step between 90 min ipa and the 120 min ipa. I would be very interested to try the three of them in a row, one after another."
"Shining light copper. The aroma, though subtle, is very unique and enjoyable giving hints of wet wood, tobacco and peach, while the warrior hops contribute a distinct spicyness along with a touch of tangerine and lemon. The wood contribution is very lovely, mellowing out the bitterness, yet retaining the hop flavor, and also adding notes of vanilla and wine. Very dynamic, complex and interchanging flavors. The malt provides an adequate backing, but are easily conquered and beaten by the pleasing hop flavor. A very unique beer and what makes it even better is that it touches a little bit of history that I never knew existed."
"I wish there was more sweetness in this to balance out the oak and the alcohol. This might be the first time I've thought a beer had too much oak. I had expected much more out of this, but oh well, my DFH 90 minute never disappoints."
"If you ask me, this is an IPA mixed with a barley wine and a touch of the Indian Brown Ale. That is my dream. Possibly reality....?"
"Unfortunatly I only had the pleasure of sampling a 12 ounce botle of this noble creation. No fbottled on dat given, too bad cuz I'm sure this one will age nicely. Pours a nice soft dark honey tone, fairly clear with a tan head, leaves scattered aand fine lacing upon a gentle swirl. Nose of brandy, hops and dense peaty malts. Soft smooth, velvety mouthfeel. This is a fine fine brew, ready to consume today and i'm sure will only get better after a ffew years in a cool, dark place. Notes of vanilla, brandy, leather, rich malts, citric hops. Yeah baby this is the goods. Everything soft and smooth, no harshness or bitterness. Balanced and highly drinkable. Looking to get more of this stuff, alot more! Seek out and enjoy."
"Full creamy mouth with the right amount of carbonation. About as drinkable as something this strong can be."
"Overall, an excellent offering from Dogfish Head, just not quite as 'unique' as I'd been expecting."
"Bottle Pours a clear amber with a large creamy off white head that produces good lacing and is lasting. Has a great hoppy aroma of spruce and pine. Has an oily scent as well. Taste is a crisp mild IPA. Not overly bitter. Has a good mouthfeel. Is on the light bodied side. The high abv is very well hidden. Carbonation is a little light but not bad. Overall another winner from Dogfish Head, I really love the beer these guys make."
"Although this is very enjoyable one is enough for me. Another big beer from dogfish that keeps you sipping waiting to discover a deeper taste."
"Overall a tasty and complex beer with some debatable and some actual flaws that nevertheless manages to be awesome."
"An interesting brew, although not one I'm sure I'd drop another $5 for a 12oz bottle again anytime soon."
"Somehow I'm getting something like winter seasonal in the tropics. There's a big contrast in flavors but they meld together suprisingly well."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with a thick creamy head. It had a predominately sweet caramel odor to it. Some complexity showed in the taste. It was fruity, with some woodiness noticeable, and a very faint hoppiness. A very smooth beer, and quite drinkable. I had this right after trying the Shelter Pale Ale, and the higher alcohol content is quite noticeable but not unpleasant."
"Basically tastes like a dulled version of the 90 minute IPA kicked up in alcohol just a tad with a very very very very subtle wood flavor. As a fan of big oak beers I was honestly a bit disappointed with the subtlety in this. It's good, don't get me wrong, but for TWICE the price of the already expensive 90 minute which I love, well... I probably won't be buying this again anytime soon."
"Very attractive shiny copper color with persistent quarter-inch head throughout almost the entire beer. Very candyish smell, with quite a bit of tropical fruit, like pineapple and papaya. Initially sickly sweet slick phenolic flavor, reminiscent of cotton candy, juicy fruit gum, and cream soda. I also get a slightly chalky finish, like milk of magnesia or peptol bismol. The hops just don't come through to balance much here, although they begin to assert themselves a little after a while. Mouthfeel is light and fluffy for such a seemingly viscous beer. Drinkability can be summed up as """Ooof, my stomach hurts.""" Unique but not great."
"Pours a translucent, fiery golden/red color with a finger odf khaki head atop and a bit of lacing. Nose is light - floral hops, vanilla creme, oak, and some tropical fruitiness. Taste reminded me of a muted, casked version of 90 Minute. Creamy vanilla, wood, apricot and peaches, a short but sharp floral hop bitterness and a noticeable alcohol bite at the end, though still quite drinkable for 10%. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied and lightly carbonated. I really enjoyed this one. For those days when you want 90 Minute, but just don't have the energy, this is your best bet. Vanilla, oak and fruity tones make this a refined IIPA for the distinguished BA."
"D - Not bad. I can't see myself drinking more than one of this in a sitting, because the flavor is so potent, particularly the sweetness. I will have this again, if it is ever released again."
"A big, aggressive Double IPA; young tasting. Could definitely stand to be cellared for a few years to mellow this out. The alcohol presence is very raw."
"Pours a reddish, cream soda colr with a well formed head. There is not much in the way of aroma, slightly sweet with no hop aroma. the beer is full bodied, smooth across the tongue. The taste is silky smooth, deep sweet grain, cool and fills every nook and cranny with caramel, fig and set off by just the right amount of hops. Not Piney, grassy or anything else, just dry and equal to the task . Wow, only a slight bit of heat at the end, just enough when inhaling to let you know how bug this baby is. Really steep ay $17+ per 4pack, but man what a great tasting beer."
"An interesting and complex brew. Dogfish Head is sometimes hit or miss for me, but this one is a hit. I would like to enjoy it again soon. Not tonight though because I showed some restraint and left 2 of the 3 left on the shelf for other beer lovers."
"Anyway, an interesting beer from the mad scientists at Dogfish Head."
"This pours a clear brownish red with a large two finger white foamy head. This is a very good looking beer. The smell is hoppy,yet subdued. The oak mellows the hops. The taste has some hop bitterness with some mollasses sweetness. The aftertaste is very sweet, but refreshing for a high alcohol beer.The m/f is medium and the flavors are very well balanced. Each sip should be savored because the flavors change as the beer moves down your tongue. Another interesting and different beer from Dogfish Head."
"First sip yields a very smooth almost creamy texture of IPA and Bourbon. Sweet caramel transitions to bitter with a long bitter pine aftertaste. A well crafted brew. Has all the intangible, hard to describe qualities that I like I wish I could give more detail, but the flavors seem to blend perfectly for me. I guess it is an awesome IIPA rounded out with sweetness and oak. Very complex and exciting."
"D - Pretty good. You can sip on this one after a long day and it'll take the edge off, but goes down smooth and has an interesting flavor to say the least."
"Talk about a value buy $2.50 a piece at my local sixpack shop. Appears a copper amber with a fluffy cream colored head leaves lacing all around my chalice, very nice look to it. Aroma has deep leafy citrus pine scented hops alcohol presence is noticeable vinous green hops, Sam and Co. have truly tamed the hop it brings layers of grapefruit and other tart fruit notes along with the oak presence with evident sugary caramel malt. Smells of candy coated hops syrupy alcohol over ripened fruit tones. Taste has a complex orgy of malts, hops and complex characteristics from oak barrel aging giving this one a mellow charred oak vanilla character and the hops have a citrus, pine, and earthy dirt qualities sugary malts matched with the more than ample bitterness finishes with a just a cinge of acohol...one quality creation. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied syrupy textured with oily resinous streaks coming through the lucious body is handled with an even carbonation which flows surprisingly smoothly along the palate. Drinkability is amazing...one extreme IPA very solid tasty offering great flavor that keeps you wanting more and more, well done I'm sold on this Woody Guthrie tribute brew."
"This beer was purchased in a four pack of twelve ounce bottles. It pours a orange/amber color with a nice tan head. The aroma is kind of tough to describe, some floral notes are present, maybe some grapefruit as well. Very malty tasting up front, slight metallic taste that fades quickly. The alcohol is noticeable. I really don't taste the oak (as I have in other beers that have oak aging), but I think I detect some grapefruit in the taste as well as the smell. I wonder what this will taste like in a year or two, I'm putting down the other bottles to find out. This is an interesting beer, I don't love it, yet it is very interesting. Definitely worth trying."
"I'm glad I had a chance to try this one. Think 1/3 DFH 120 minute mixed with 2/3 DFH 90 minute. I think that's pretty close to the truth."
"Sample was taken from a 12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. A light mahoghany color with a white head. Smells of wonderful sweet hops are easily detectable. Compared to the 90 minute this has a greater malty finish with vanilla and a bit of the wood aging on the finish. Overall, a great offering from DFH"
"For all the flavor in this beer I found it to be well balanced. It's smooth on the palate, has an excellent aroma, taste's wonderful and looks great. What more can you ask for?"
"D- This beer has nice complexity of hops and wood with some sweetness but the alcohol kept if from becoming a great beer. With a few more months to a year this should be a much better beer. Although the hops may diminish too much at that point."
"drinkability: all too drinkable"
"This is one healthy, earthy beastie! There's an impressive balance of the best of malt and hops, and the yeast lends a sensuous swing. A touch of woody musk imparts a grounded overtone to some lofty bits. The ABV is also beefy, always obvious, but never obnoxious, and nciely warming. You won't have many of these in a sitting, but what you do have flows sweetly. Once again, the mad scientists at DFH have come up big, bold, and brassy."
"Dense and tightly packed tiny sand colored bubbles sit atop the tawny copper colored beer. There are multitudes of carbonation streamers rising to the surface as the head slowly, slowly settles into uneven mounds that left minimal lacing. The smell is both malty sweet and hop fruity, with notes of oak and bark. Oranges and floral notes stand out as well. The taste is lush and sweet initially. The hops presence becomes known only in the finish. Oak and wood notes are present as well. Big, full bodied and with a creamy slick mouthfeel. The 10% alcohol shows up only after swallowing and as a gentle warming. This is definitely more malty than hoppy, as I expected a distinctly pronounced hop bite, but it still goes down quite easily. Perhaps too easily. As it warms the malt sweetness becomes even more pronounced. Nice overall, but I was expecting something slightly different for a DIPA."
"If i were looking to session a barleywine, this would be the one i'd choose."
" Taste is good. This month old bottle tastes like 90 minute with a hint of oak. Flowery and grapefruit hops are strong, the oak is just background noise. Mouthfeel is slick, thick, and oily. Drinkability is great, too bad this has such limited availability. I will try to age about five of these."
"Pours a clear copper color with a fluffy two finger head after a harder pour that leaves no lace behind as it settles, pretty alcoholic on the nose alcohol dipped peaches and apricots with a light toasted grain note.A bigger chewey mouthfeel but it slides down quite easily,the oak aging of this beer is very evident its very prevalent thru out from beginning to finish the high alcohol content is also big.Flavors are more fruity than anything else mainly overipe peaches there is a nice piney hop profile that interacts well.This is not a big hopped up DIPA extremely balanced I think the alcohol and the sweeter malt base is just as big as the hop profile.I like it not quite what I thought it might be but I liked it and would try again for sure."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is smooth and silky as if it coats your whole mouth. Slight burn on the backend roof of your mouth as it goes down, but this keeps you awake and wanting more. Drinkability depends on the type of beers you like. if you like IPA's or DIPA's, this is a great beer to have one or two, but definately not a session beer as you would probably leave stumbling...."
"Burton Baton (the name is a tribute to the spiritual home of British brewing in general and IPAs in particular) is a first-class beer even if it isn't much of a Double IPA. This is only speculation since it's my first bottle, but I'll venture a guess that round about its first birthday is the optimal time to enjoy this fantastically balanced, supremely sippable, gentle giant of a beer."
"All in all, this beer rides the fine line between balls-out hop flavor and mellow, age-wizened restrained. Its really the best of both worldsand one that could totally be an introductory beer for those hop-fearing souls."
"Drinkability is a tough one for this beer. I think it is very enjoyable and I could drink more than one and still be happy with it, but the level of alcohol makes it unreasonable to just throw down with reckless abandon. None the less, I gave it a good score for drinkability mostly because I would not put this beer down without finishing it."
"overall, this is one of DFH's master creations.. a heartfelt lesson in both balanced restraint and luxurious excess. i hope this beer stays on the roster for a long time. i'll be buying 4-packs every year until i'm six feet underground- me and the guy on the label."
"Pours a clear copper in color, with a massive off-white head and plentiful, even carbonation. Very lacy as the beer sinks down the glass. I must admit, I get a bit nervous about oak-flavored beers. Very often the oakiness overpowers just about everything else in both the aroma and the flavor. So it was with a bit of trepidation that I took my first sip. Mercifully, however, the oak character here is fairly restrained  difficult to detect, even. Instead, the aroma is characterized by a mild spiciness, citric fruit, with something of a brown sugar scent. The flavor bears a significantly heavier imprint of oak than the aroma, but is still restrained enough to allow some of the other characteristics of the beer to show through. Malty, sweet, and sugary at the start, the beer finishes with a rather unexpected slight sour tinge. My biggest complaint with the flavor, however, is actually its sugary sweetness. There are some interesting features to this beer, but this feature renders it a bit too cloying for sustained drinking."
"As stated above, this tribute to the original Burton has been on my list for a while. While I taste enough of Dogfish Head's signature style to know this is not a faithful reproduction, I can also appreciate what they were trying to accomplish. Would most certainly drink again. Can't wait till my remaining bottles age a bit."
"I tried remembering the story behind this beer--something about this being two Dogfish beers combined - perhaps a 90 Minute and something else. Hoppy as sin, but not as complex or as tasty as the 90 or as drinkable as the 60 minute. Still a great brew by a great brewery."
"(25.6 oz. brown champagne style bottle, corked and caged)"
"The hop character is probably a bit muted when compared to a fresh sample, but it is still quite evident and really strikes a nice balance with the oak and malt right at this moment in time. The malt has notes of raisins, currants and a bit of caramel. I really like how the spicy oak notes, along with the hint of woody astringency, combine with the spicy and herbal hop notes. The two accentuate each other and form a melodic whole. There are some really nice fruity notes here as well; it is a nice mix of grapefruit, raisins, currants, and even some general berry-type notes thrown into the mix. Quite and enjoyable beer, and I hope to sample this one again."
"Drinkability- Digging the oak taste and texture on this beer. One of the few if not only oak IPA I've had. Seems fitted to have with a dessert. Quite tasty and different."
"Go get some... You won't be disappointed."
"Orange with a red hue and a quickly rising tall white head. As the head drops it leaves a few sticky rings of lace. Aroma was a mix of must, some hops and dirt. I though it the aroma was just a mish mosh of things that never really pulled together. Flavor was a bit better with a sweet caramel and biscuit base with notes of musty wood, earthiness and some light floral notes. Interesting but not all that cohesive as a whole. Solid body that was ample and smooth. Drinkability was ok but nothing special. After drying a dry hopped version of this I had higher hopes while not bad this let me down a bit."
"Overall- unbalanced between the sweet fruitiness and malt. 1 of these to sit back and sip at is nice, but more than that and it would be too sickeningly sweet."
"Incredible!"
"I've been eager to try this one and a bottle was generously provided by LuckySevens82. Pours a half finger light tan head over a nearly clear copper rust colored liquid. Smells citrus hoppy, mildly oaky, caramelized sugars, orange oil. Tastes sweet and citrus hoppy to start. Sour and tangy then comes in with smoked malt and caramelized sugar. Apricot and pear with a touch of raspberry acid. The swallow produces dried wood, almonds, and a hint of chocolate. No single flavor stands overly strong over any other, but although they work well together, but some don't quite meld as married couples. Thick viscous mouthfeel and moderate carbonation."
"overall: very good brew. so different from everything else in this style, that i often wonder if it should be characterized as an iipa. one of my favorites just the same."
"Beer is good. Happy strong beering."
"Drinkability: This beer is very well done. No flavor of alcohol at all. They hide the 10% magnificently with delicate layers of hop and malt flavor. I recommend you try this one if you haven't already."
"Thanks to GCBrewingCo for this bottle."
"Thanks for the trade Squidswillbsquids (shane). Hoppy and smooth, blend of I believe 90 minute and something else. Boozy. Light orange with big head. Nicely carbonated. Crisp, and yet oak ageing. Long aftertaste. Great with a meal. Well balanced, well done."
"Drinkability was really very high and good almost see this being a session beer as it was so easy and smooth to drink. Best DFH beer I've had in a long time."
"This is an excellent beer regardless of genre. It is well crafted, and the barrel aging does wonders for it. Its nice to drink a well hopped beer that isn't over the head with hops, but rather plays them so well with & against the other flavors. I highly recommend this, and will look for more opportunities to try it again."
" Wow. Sweet malty orange and fruits on the start, with some slight tartness and hop bitterness as the finish approaches, not a hop-bomb at all. Vanilla and oak swirl through the middle. Mouthfeel is lush, full; light velvety carbonation and slickness, drying a bit towards the end, but not a dry finish per se. The 10% alcohol contributes nicely to the mouthfeel and taste, and warming, but is wrapped nicely inside this brew. Thanks for the sample, Evan."
"An almost perfect combination of chewy malts, hops, citrus notes. I could drink this one everyday"
"medium to full body, creamy with good carbonation. very drinkable but watch out"
"Fiery copper, topped with a thick, creamy white head. Good retention, nice brussels lacing. Decent clarity, with just a bit of a chill haze. Juicy, oaky hop aroma. Heavy pale malt, with a resiny pine prickle. The woody, oaken tones are superb. The flavor opens with a gorgeously fruity pale malt sweetness. Heavy notes of apple and pear, even a hint of maraschino cherry sweetness. Alcohol presents itself early, blended with a soothing oak character. Heavy hopping in the finish, yet integrated. Pine sap and a touch of citrus, with an underlying earthiness. Just enough of a bitter snap in the finish. An oaky hoppiness in the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied, with a sleepy carbonation. Very refreshing, despite it's strength. I'll certainly be trying this again. I'm a bit hit or miss with this brewery, but this is a big winner."
"Pours a deep walnut brown with coppery highlights, the head fading quickly to a scant, grayish film that sort of clings lightly. Sigh... A few dozen slow, long-spaced streamers run through this translucent, sediment-free liquid. Smelled cool, it's a bit unassuming, like sniffing at dry herbs (oregano?) or stale biscuits, with definite whiffs of vanilla and oak in the finish. By the time the beer is at room temperature, though, it has absolutely blossomed, getting thick with bitter hop oils and even a basil-like sweetness. The taste profile evolves similarly, but to cut to the chase, think: grapefruit salsa broiled with a drizzle of maple syrup; mango chutney heavy on the cardamom; toasted caramel sweetness spread between bitter planks of pine. Absolutely superb three-pronged attack of sweet, spicy, and bitter. As the sweetness falls away and leaves behind a high and dry mouthfeel, I feel like I have to lick the bitter varnish off each and every one of my teeth. So smooth that you have to rely on your warming belly to realize that you'd better take it easy before this Baton cracks you across the head. IMHO, this is everything a double IPA should be."
"If you are expecting a heavy hand of hops to blast over your tongue, you are looking at the wrong beer. It is, however, a unique and tasty experience that I would recommend. The bottle recommends aging so I think I will put the other three in the cellar for a while. I can't wait to see how this oddity matures."
"Somewhat cloudy in appearance, with a dark amber-infused copper color. Thin off-white head. Sparse lacing. Nose is wonderful. Hefty load of hoppy notes: fruity, with some fresh grapefruit detected prominently. Pine cones, perfumy flowers, some bitter chocolate. Flavor is good, but more tame than expected. 90-minute IPA blew me away, but this tasted more like a toned-down version of it with just a touch of """wood""". The hops are pretty muted here, and the sweetness from the malt takes a larger role. ABV is hidden for a 10% ABV beer. Good mouthfeel...certainly more creamy than expected. Despite the high ABV, this was quite drinkable. Another neat beer from the gang at Dogfish. Well-done."
"I didn't like it as much as the 90 minute, but it was damn good."
"Finger licking good!"
"If I had a 10-gallon hat, it would be off in honor of this immaculate creation."
"Thanks again to cmaruschak for the opportunity to sample this rare one."
"Pours with a big head an a pretty dark gold colour. The nose is all hops but tempered with some age. The taste is a big oily IPA that resonates with wood and pine needles. The more you sip this beer , the more the depth of flavours weigh out. Drinkability is huge as the beer smooths out past the intial hop hit. A truly big step in the evolution of the Double IPA."
"Notes: Now that I've poured in the rest of the bottle, there is a good amount of yeast hazing and some large dark colored chunks. They're probably hops. Although it is 10% ABV, its not hot or solventy, although it is easily tasted, and a little too strong. Definitely needs more time to cellar. This beer is just way too sweet for me, that unrelenting malt just makes it hard to drink. I wish the oak was stronger also."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed 1""" of beige head over the light copper brew. Head lasts well, leaving a pillowy head, and heavy foamy lacing from top to bottom of the glass. Aroma is mutedly hoppy for a DFH brew. Taste is lightly fruity, with a tangy hops presence. Mouthfeel is where barrel-aging starts to show on this brew, very smooth, with some oaky notes at the same time. Drinkability for the style is incredible. An excellent brew."
"The mouthfeel was pleasantly mellow an dry. But not so dry that it bored or knocked out one's tongue.It kept me coming back for more."
"Mouthfeel is rich and full....with a nice creamy aspect as well. I wouldn't mind having a few of these...I wish it wasn't so rare. I hope DFH makes more of this! Thanks to Cornboy for the opportunity to sample one of my new favorite Dogfish brews!"
"This might be out of order, but wow, great aroma. Maybe not to style, but a wonderful vanilla oak aroma. Similar to a great Chardonnay. Appearance is straight up amber, slight head, okay lacing. Flavor is good, but, dare I say this about a DFH beer, underhopped for style. Hops are there, but there is a serious sweet malt backbone to this beer. Overall, I like this beer. It's not best of style to me, but it's still good. Many thanks to my Secret Bunny, Squidswillbesquids."
"A clean amber beer with a big foamy light beige head and nice lace. The aroma starts with a sweet nut like maltiness with a hint of some citrusy hops in the background. Every mouthfull changes your perseption of the main character of the beer. One time it is that sweet nut like malt. next its a spicey hop snap. And always just in the background almost hidden is the welcome home warmth of the the alcohol. Maybe not as complex in the range of tastes as a Belgian but at least as well crafted to create this smooth unique American brew."
"The body is huge, creamy, and bursting at the seams. Soft carbonation carries you through to the lasting finish filled with caramel drizzled citrus shadowed by oaky dryness. This is one of, if not the best DFH I've had to date. Superb and sublime!"
"This is a sturdy drink that could stand up to tons of strong flavors. It's a nice apertif if I do say so myself."
"Not my style. Actually, 2IPA is my style, but not this one. Kind of makes my teeth hurt. Too sweet for me to enjoy more than one."
"Just a hint of alcohol on the finish. A very smooth beer for 10% abv. Quite nice, but dont open the bottle expecting a hop bomb!"
"12 0z bottle. Nice appearance with a hazy orange-ish body and a creamy dollop of white foam atop. The head retention is very good and it leaves some nice splotches of lace at the outset of the glass. Oddly enough, the Dogfish Head yeast is more prevalent in the nose than the hops are... odd, unless they were looking to show off some or the oak-aging. There's some wet-straw, a spoonful of sweet fruit, some nuttiness, a brush of woodiness, a touch of diacetyl, and a drip of honey. It's intriguing. The body is medium-full and dextrinous; and it slides so smoothly, almost oily across the palate with only a caress of very-fine bubbled carbonation on the tongue. The flavor mirrors the aroma with little more to offer than a mild vinous quality and a note of vanilla, but again, it's intriguing and engaging! The wood is clearly a massive part of this beer, and that alone deserves some attention as it's a great example of the type of flavors that the wood imparts, and it can even give you an idea of how these similar characteristics appear in in wine. On that same note, the 10% alcohol is apparent in the same way that it might be found in a fine wine. It's doesn't ever step from the wings but you always know it's there; and it plays a major role in the direct flavor and overall character of the beer. It appears in the finish once the dribble of juiciness runs off the palate, and it helps to dry things; but it's almost immediately backed by the drying, raspy nature of the wood. Tied together just a little more tightly, this could be a brilliant beer."
"Highly drinkable. It plays with a just a few notes, but does it very well."
"12 ounce bottle. Kudos to Sam, great job!"
"If mellowness and balance are your thing, you will like this beer. But if you are seeking an extreme hop bomb, be prepared to be disappointed."
"Drinkability and Overall: Easily the best DIPA I've had to date. The balance is incredible. It's almost unmatched. THis beer is so smooth and creamy, it just keeps you sipping. A simply stunning beer that's not for the weak of heart."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a lightly hazed orangy tea color with a fluffy beige head. Rich malty, nutty aroma with hints of woody, vinous hops that bear a blood orange-like citrusness. Wow, it's thick, yet maintains a nice estery, drier finish that is peppered with mellowed hops and a hint of butterscotchy oak barrel. It really has a nice mellow feel to it. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. A great accompaniment to a good cigar."
"Dangerously drinkable at 10% ABV. Another innovative and creative beer from the brewers at DFH. This beer is worth checking out if you enjoy imperial IPA's. The price may be a little much, but its so friggin tasty. You make the call."
"This beer didn't really blow me away. I was surprised, as Dogfish Head usually pushes the limits of brewing and makes some of my favorite beers. This however was a bit odd. And don't get me wrong, I generally like weird beers. Pours a fairly clear golden amber color with a bit of white head resting on top. Scent is very hoppy at first, all citrussy, but there's this strange scent that it's mixed with... oddly reminds me of catfood or tuna or something. Interesting, different, but not particularly appetizing. Taste was much the same. A bit sweet and not quite bitter enough for a double IPA. The aged flavor doesn't really work here with the mix. Average mouthfeel but something just isn't quite working with this beer. Seems like all the flavors clash rather than work with each other. I kind of got bored of drinking this one after a while. Maybe a little tweaking and this beer could be improved."
"Tangy sweet fruit flavors up front. Malt develops some sweetish caramel roll flavors too, but the tangy, slightly acidic fruitiness stays there. Right before the hops come in, the palate turns oaky with some tannins. Interesting. Hops are resinous and spicy and provide an ample bitter burn. Alcohol is there, but isn't out of whack, it just adds to the complexity. Medium-full bodied; starts with a frothy, creamy-yet-bubbly mouthfeel, and then gets thicker in the finish. Worth $6.45, but sadly, this was my only bottle."
"Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass, it pours a honey/amber color w/ 1 finger thick o spongy, slight tan head that clings to a glass like Sulldaddy to a fat-chick! Aroma is mostly citrus hops with some slight caramel tones. It even exudes a little biscuit aroma and just enough alcohol to tickle your nose. Taste is a sweet, citrus (grapefruit) flavor with a buttery feel up front. The finish is a little bit of biscuits along with some drying alcohol, which gives a little oak barrel flavor. The feel is a little oily and smooth with a bit of dryness on the finish. Lots of bellywarming from this one! A little sweet for my taste, and I expected a little more floral hops than it gave, but I have another and I want to age it for a year to see what happens! Very enjoyable! Just a well balanced, fun brew!"
"Pours a clear amber with a great fluffy 2 finger white head that lasts. Aroma is a little floral, with some sweetness and a orange brulee scent. Its as if someone took a torch to an orange rind and caramelized the oils. Taste has the same citrus sweetness with a bit of citrus oil bitterness. There is just a slight woody note. Its if the 90 minute and the wood aged parts are fighting for the title. There is also a taste there that i cant find, but it is so deep and good maybe a bit of lemon tartness or is it more floral, or a combination? There is a nice bit of sweetness to counter act the hops. Mouthfeel has a touch of sticky sweet hop notes like a natural citrus candy. Well carbonated and very smooth. This is tip top drinkable. Not quite as great as the straight 90 minute in my mind as something is just a little different and less. Overall however this is a great beer. I hope they make more of this, maybe the price will drop then."
"After my mind wrapped around the initial shock of the tastes, it settle down into quiet enjoyment. Excellent brew."
"John"
"Drinkability: wish it had a bit more hop character. For those who enjoy a strong oktoberfest though, you might love this one."
"The taste is sweeter than I thought it would be. The body is lighter, too. This is not a real heavy drinking beer. It goes down pretty easy and finishes spicy, with a lingering alcohol bite that stays in the throat. As the beer warms, an intricate texture of caramelized slices of tannic bitternuttiness (new word) presents itself. Overall, I enjoyed the experience of drinking this beer. It was very interesting."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a light copper color with one finger of head. There's a touch of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very unique. It has a lot of earthy aromas and a good amount of charred wood character. Tons of hoppiness as well. The taste is simply amazing. Sweet pale malt up front, with some caramel sweetness. Then it's taken over by wood flavors and a slight hint of orange peel. A nice hoppy finish rounds it out. Not a hint of alcohol in sight. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability is murderous. A fantastic brew."
"The broes enticing review had my mouth watering for this one. The beer has a great dark copper-red color and modest head. Immediately I smelled hops and fresh malt. Big grapefruit hop smell. Surprising amount of carbonation that on second taste seems appropriate. This beer really has a woody element to it that reminds me of hickory smoked barbeque. The 90 Minute IPA has always been one of my favorites, but this may be a hair better. It becomes lighter on the pallette when it warms and the hops really """blossom.""" I think this might be my first five! Definitely going to age a few of these."
"I'd like to try a few more Burton Batons, but at $13 bucks a 4 pack, and it being a limited release, it may be a while.."
"Woody & lemony. Good balance. Somewhat heavy handed oak flavour. Very slight hints of vanilla. Full bodied, relaxed carbonation. Another winner from DFH."
"Thanks to LuckySevens82 for sending this my way. It pours a light copper color with a tall head that hangs around for a while. The aroma has some citrus notes as well as some woody character, from the oak. Quite a bit of spiciness and citrus hops. I expected the flavor to be huge in hop character, but it wasn't. It had a lot of hops in it, but they were nice and mellow and flowed really well with the malt profile of the beer, making it very well balanced. Quite a bit of spices and some oak in the flavor. Honestly, I couldn't detect much of the alcohol, especially for 10%. Dangerously drinkable. Great beer!"
"The mouthfeel is full and chewy and just about right here. This one is a sipper, but a very nice one at that."
"Hmm...Burton Baton. I'm intrigued by the label that tells me this beer is a mix of young and old IPAs aged in French oak; intrigued because I like hops and like the effect that age can have on hops. That said, this wasn't quite what I expected, but I still like it. I liked the earthy, woody aroma of this ale. I liked how the earthiness and vanilla-oakiness emerged among the caremelly malt and herbal hop flavors. I am surprised by the clarity of this brew. I'm not surprised that as I poured this light amber elixir there was little foam, yet a tingle of carbonation that seems to accent what bitterness hides beneath the sweet malt and oaky flavors. Double IPA? I don't think so (not enough hop spiciness) -- more a well attenuated barleywine to me -- that I think really needs to age some more, so I'm tucking the remaining bottles away in a place where I'll forget about them."
"not as full of a body as one might expect with smooth carbonation, with an almost cask like quality, especially as it warms. intensely drinkable. overall very well balanced, great tasting, and a real pleasure to drink. worth every penny of the 13.99 4 pack. i'd like to pick up one to cellar."
"A gigantic thank you goes out to Luckysevens82 for supplying this delightful treat."
"Thanks to luckysevens82 and clvand0 for bringing this to my glass. It pours a deep copper color with a 2 finger thick head. The nose is great, with great citrusy hops but with a great spicey wood character. Wow. Smells nice. The flavor is super mellow. Sweet hops over a nice caramel base, but the wood character hits on the aftertaste. Very nice. The beer is really warming after swallowing. The feel is nice and thick, with a slight carbonation. Outside the warming feeing in my stomach, this doesn't drink like a 10% beer. Another winner from DFH."
"Pours a light amber orange color with a whispy white head. Aromas are a mix of lemony and citrus hops with a huge dosage of hard caramels. Initial flavors are a strong mix of caramels with a huge lemon zest bite, and a resinous earthy hop smack. Within this wonderful mix is a slight oaky vanilla character and just an absolutely smooth and creamy mouthfeel. There is an apparant sweetness throughout this brew but it does not overpower or take anything away from the wonderful caramels and hops. The finish is only slightly bitter but nicely fruity with a nice firm citrus flavor that ends with just a hint of sweetness. Overall a very enjoyable brew and super drinkable (is this seriously 10%?). A great offering by Dogfish Head. Also awesome label graphic."
"an orangy, brown nectar that seems to glow. Good two finger head. you can smell it as soon as you pop the top. grapefruit, hoppy green smells dominate the smell.you can also detect the alcohol with a slight burn in the nose. you can taste the 90 minute, mostly in your burps, but it is there with a more burnt goldent aste added to it. not as hoppy and much more reserved, but still clearly DFH. vanillia ntoes pop on the tounge. great thick luxourious mouthfeel, and way to drinable at 10%. perhaps one of the mospt outrageous yet well balanced and beautifully crafted DFH brews."
"Yes, I found the """Imperial Double Dry-Hopped Oak-Cask Aged IPA""" (it helps that this was one I was looking for anyway), and yes, I opened it just to be contrarian. But I'm glad I did because this is really enjoyable. This is the 2nd of what I call Imperial Single IPAs that I've had (which I mention mostly since they have too much malt sweetness to be lumped in with other DIPAs, including DFH's own 90 Min), and while it doesn't jump out as boldly as the Stoudts, the more mellow flavor is a nice contrast, and also gives this quite a nice drinkability (especially since it definitely has oak aging, but isn't overdone the same way some of the more recent ones have seemed to do). A truely enjoyable beer, one that I'm happy to get my hands on, and certainly one I'd like to see in the future (2nd chance guys!!!)"
"Overall, an interesting and tasty take on the style that was a real treat to sip."
"Mouthfeel is a thick, syrupy delight...could put down a few of these, but a session brew...don't think so."
"Very nice,pale color-some great orange hues in there. No real head to speak of but theres some very nice lacing going on. Somewhat subdued hop aroma-whats there is grassy with a touch of citrus. Slight spiciness-almost comes thru as a vanilla/cinnamon cross. Big,slick malt and hop combination in the flavor. Theres more malt then hops if you ask me. Very minimal oakiness to it. Almost quenching in the finish. Killer body-love that oily feel. An extremely enjoyable beer but not as intense as the label might have you believe."
"Some quick lacing of head with a flat covering. Very light copper hue, with almost an orange glow, and tons of clarity with a great deal of action. To nose, kind of a hop with cloaking device employed on it; slight juiciness, like lemon Starburst. Surprised by how tempered the hop character is; more malt actually seems to come through; also, a light char character hits, likely the result of the barreling. Creamy mouthfeel lingers for a bit and then the warming alcohol notes pull through. Excellent."
"A two-thread beer, blended with a new Imperial IPA aged in French oak for four months and 90 Minute IPA. The latter is noticeable, perhaps too noticeable to make this truly unique, but the end result is a welcomed familiarity, and none-the-less deliciously complex. Burton Baton is a concept that I've come to expect from Dogfish Head. Kick-ass."
"I'd say a dark rusty copper is the colour of this enigmatic brew. There is also a nice head of slightly off-white tan. This brew also left excellent lacing in my glass as well. The aromas are all floral, spicy hops, oak notes, a distinctive spicy fruitiness, and more. The taste is somewhat sweet up front with a very rounded mouthfeel and some slightly oaky hints as well. The oak hints are not very wood-like, but they do lend a distintively spicy level of complexion to the hoppiness of this beer. The mouthfeel is very well rounded, and truly cask-like in composition, and the drinkablity remains extremely high for a 10%abv, 80ibu brew from the folks at DFH. Wow, this one was really worth the wait. Another extraordinary creation by DFH. Excellent job guys!"
"Drinkability & Notes: This is one hefty double IPA, I paired it with a creamy Danish blue cheese and honey wheat crackers. Big time kudos to DFH for keeping it real as usual."
"The beer poured a bright copper/orange color with a medium white head that leaves a ring of lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is the grassy/piney note that you expect from the DFH offerings mellowed by the oak that lends a hint of vanilla. The vanilla combines nicely with the toffee character of the malt. Taste does not have the malt-up-front Im used to and expect in the DFH IPA. Much more subtle. The vanilla/toffee character comes across stronger than I expected too. Very rich and smooth mouth feel. Very little hop bite. Mellow alcohol warming. Very drinkable beer."
"Funny they use the term """elusive""" in the description of this beer, because it does have flashes of greatness, but just falls a bit short. Dark copper color with a compact white head. Thin, spotty lacing. The aroma is pretty bright, with hops, grapefruit and caramel. The oak presence is there as well. Medium-bodied with a flavor profile on the verge of being spectacular, it just appears there is one piece missing somewhere. Subtle woody character, with hops, citrus along with a creamy sweetness. The finish is sweet fruit and fresh hops. Lots of pieces to the puzzle here, and if they came together perfectly this beer would be world class. Even with that I enjoyed this one a lot. Great potential here."
"12 oz bottle. Clear deep orange, tanish head. Bourbony, malty, alcohol, meaty floral aroma, with a touch of brown sugar. Rich malty flavor, with molasses, carmel, alcohol, and single malt all blended together. Big full mouth feel. Not too dry, not too sweet. Rather barley wine like, and somewhat remeniscent of BA Old Salty and Insanity. Maybe a bit pricy at 14 bucks a 4 pack, but worth at least one purchase."
"Certainly not a """session beer," but 6 to 12 ounces of this is most welcome on a cold and snowy Ohio evening (or afternoon, for that matter)!"
"I can see this getting better over time. I can also see it fading away. We'll see what comes of it. It's very interesting, as many folks have come to expect from DFH."
"Overall, I would say that this is exceptionally drinkable for the thickness and ABV, it is certainly one that I enjoyed and certainly something that I feel that DFH should be commended for."
