4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, even though the bitterness was on the lower side for the style, the hop flavors showed up nicely with some good fruity hop flavors and aromas.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, the alcohol was a little well hidden, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think a couple of these would be a good amount for me, any more than that and the alcohol might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was nice and fruity while imparting some good flavors and aromas.  What I liked the least about this beer was that it didn't just a little more bitterness to help balance out the sweetness.  I would buy this beer again, especially if I could find it really fresh.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like fruity DIPA's.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it had just about everything that I expect from the style with a nice hop profile to go with it.  This beer made for a good first impression of Weyerbacher and I'm really interested in trying more of their beers.  Good job guys, this was a tasty DIPA, keep it up.","StoutHunter","Feb 18, 2015"

On the palate it definitely lived up to its aromas. At first it has a rich flavor of banana, orange peel and tropical fruit which leads to slight notes of pine and bread to finish out with. I love all the elements of this one and would definitely recommend it! Its different and interesting with rich flavor.","AyeMito","Aug 29, 2014"

The aroma is all malt - no hop profile at all.  The flavor reminds me more of a barley wine than a DIPA - balanced, but skewing towards the malt side.  The bottle version is, for all intents and purposes, a different beer.","HamdenHector","Aug 09, 2014"

Not overtly hoppy especially for a iipa, but has a lingering hoppy and piney aftertaste that continues for quite a while. Mouthfeel is good and beer is well balanced, not too light or heavy. Drinks quite easily for a 9% iipa and I am drinking this after a big dinner out. All around a good local iipa that I won't actively seek out but will probably pick up occasionally.","RollTide7","Feb 23, 2013"

The aroma is divine and the flavors are complex without anything out of place. This is one of the benchmark DIPAs from one of the benchmark breweries, in my opinion.

For a DIPA, it's actually well-balanced and I liked the maltiness- I might actually compare that maltiness of DFH's 60 minute with the bitterness of their 90 minute. This is the closest comparison I can think of and I'm not surprised as DFH uses Simcoe as one of their hops. Personally, I'm not a huge fan since my palate has adjusted too much to hoppy DIPAs, but I did taste this about 4 hours after drinking a Hopslam. I have another bottle in the fridge so if anything changes, I'll edit the review. But otherwise it is what it is for now- a good DIPA with a good, earthy malt presence.

Mouthfeeel is pretty wet and slick with a dryer finish. The hop presence helps dry it out even more. First sip wasn't impressive. However, as I drink it, it gets better. I'm a Simcoe hop fan, so I might've anticipated trying this one a little too much. I do like it. It's well above average as a DIPA, just not in the same ballpark as the Double Jacks, Abrasives, and Pure Hoppinesses. The alcohol underlies the flavors. The bitterness of the alcohol sort of carries the flavors along without affecting them to drastically. A lot of bread and sweet cherry cordials. I like it a lot better as it warms up. It's much tangier and more citrusy cold. It gets sweet as it warms. There's some pine flavor in there. I think it is pretty complex.

It's such an aggressive assault on the senses that traditional terms like """balanced""" and """complex""" apply, but only if one is referring to a gladiator. Whoever is in charge of constructing this monster on a regular basis is a genius; even though the beer may vary ever-so-slightly from batch to batch, it maintains a distinctly dominating tropical citrus flavor profile and especially a chewy mouthfeel that has made me pull this off the shelf several times a month for over 3 years now.

It is on the darker side as far as color, which matches up with the increased caramel malt presence in the aroma and taste. Even with all the malty sweetness, Simcoe hops are the name of the game here. Because only Simcoe hops were used, this beer doesn’t have the big bouquet that a lot of DIPAs have but it still has a lot to offer.

3.94,-3,3,4,4,4,4,"Often, an IPA gives you a quick flash of sweetness and then intense bitterness. Here, I get an intense hop bitterness as soon as it touches my tongue, yet there always seems to be a faint caramel-like sweetness in the backdrop which balances it out nicely all the way through the finish. If I was handed this in a blind tasting and asked to guess the style, I might even guess ``American Barleywine''.","deadonhisfeet","Jun 11, 2012"

4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big mango, pineapple, orange, apricot, grapefruit, herbal, caramel, light pine, and earthy spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big orange zest, pineapple, grapefruit, mango, pine, floral, caramel, tangerine, grass, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, caramel, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor complexity(Simcoe rules); with a fantastic balance of malt sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Very smooth and easy to sip on for 9%. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth. Really great stuff.","superspak","Jun 09, 2012"

4.38,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served in a tulip glass at The Cask Republic in New Haven, CT, this shows a hazy musty-brown color with a big creamy light oatmeal colored head and a wall of lacing. The aroma is a pleasant citrus hop and mild toffee. Quite reserved. The flavor brings....ahhh...thick and sweet pine hops with slight citrus edges and plenty of moxie-like malt. There’s a touch of clove-like mintiness and lots of earthy, near peaty ideas. Really nice. This stuff is near full bodied with a slick, thick feel accompanied by fine and very adequate carbonation. Love it but probably not for sessionists.","Durge","Feb 07, 2012"

Lots of molasses-like sweetness, thick and rich with smokey notes lingering. Big hop blast with some seriously sweet and sour fruity tones. Rich, full body full of citrus bitterness, syrupy brown sugar-like sweetness, alcohol and yeast. Heavy on the syrup and booze in the mouthfeel. Syrupy, bitter, full flavored double IPA.","YouSkeete","Feb 06, 2012"

3.8,-6.4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A surprisingly dark and expectionally smooth tasting double IPA. Despite the darker amber/caramel color Double Simcoe is not very roasty tasting, has more of sweet caramel taste with the hops adding more of a balance to it then a bitterness. Very drinkable, not a very hop forward double. If you are looking for a smooth, malty sweet IPA with good balance this is a good beer. Not mouth numbing in bitterness at all.","zander4dawin","Jan 10, 2012"

I don't think the fact that it is a month old really plays into this either, the hops are still pretty damn strong. It certainly has a few dimensions playing into the flavor but I find the alcohol and bitterness combining to feel somewhat harsh.","cbutova","Jan 09, 2012"

Overall, not my favorite DIPA, but I'm never sad to see it and I do buy it pretty often.

Come winter, I would love to have one of these to warm up with but in a sea of hoppy beers, not enough stands out about this.

4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very burnt orange with a two finger head that sticks around. Can't see through it. Aroma is fruit punch, passionfruit, guava. Taste starts slightly sweet passionfruit juice, but quickly turns into a bold bitterness that stays until the beer is long gone. Mouthfeel is good with decent carbonation. Overall, very impressive. This is likely the most bitter beer I have ever tried. The only flaw is drinkability. I would like to have tasted more sweetness to balance out the hops. I know this is blasphemy, but I'm interested in seeing how this DIPA does with age.","hmf05","Oct 13, 2011"
3.78,-6.9,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,"O- very enjoyable double ipa. Reminds me of great divide's hercules, probably due to the prominent pine and woody flavors. A great representation of the style in my opinion. Pungent hoppyness, big sweet malt, a touch of alcohol burn, its all there. However, perhaps this beer's exemplary traits are its downfall. Might have liked to see a touch of something different and surprising in there for it to get an A, but I'm sure this beer is exactly what the brewers shot for.","znichols","Oct 11, 2011"

My taste buds adjusted near the end of the drink, but by then it was almost too little too late. Would love to try this one in a food pairing with a sharp cheddar. Perhaps the creaminess of the cheese would cut down the acidity in the beer and mellow it out a bit.","Mosley1212","Sep 06, 2011"

3.98,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"All in all, very tasty stuff and well made. Of course, the ABV is somewhat preventative towards having very many, but at least they did a great job masking it.

3.97,-2.2,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"The full-bodied mouthfeel is incredible. Absolutely leans toward the creamy end of the style (and of beer in general). Overall, this is certainly a worthy beer, but I'm not a huge fan. Due to the sweetness, it almost drinks like a low-alcohol American B-Wine, which in itself is not a problem. I was really let down by the taste. Granted this is a single-hop DIPA, but the hop character just seems a little lacking. It's a fine beer, but the only things that really stand out to me here are the creamy mouthfeel and caramelly sweetness that are both interesting features for the style.","dpasotti","Aug 08, 2011"
4.45,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is an amazing IPA, and for all of the bitterness that is surely present in here (in terms of IBUs, that is), the beer itself is quite drinkable, and immensely flavorful. Yes, the hops still bite at the tongue and leave the soft palate buzzing, but they don't rip and tear, as can happen with other beers of this style. Very much recommended.","jondeelee","Jul 29, 2011"

3.71,-8.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I did think this was quite a good DIPA, but it's very different in it's huge malt character that perhaps doesn't blend as well as it could with the hops. I'm not sure how fresh this bottle was so that could definitely contribute to the unbalanced nature but all in all, still a very nice sipper.","ShanePB","Jul 25, 2011"

4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is an exceptional beer. I liked weyerbacher's beers before this, but this has to be by far the best they have made. From the pour on it looks awesome. It is a solid amber with a large fluffy whit head which displays incredible lacing. The smell is foward of fruity, floral hops which i think the simcoe hop gives a little extra diversity. It is balanced perfectly by the malts. You can just tell this is going to be a good one. The taste is wonderful. There is an explosion of flavor on the tip of the tongue. Hops, citrus fruits, maybe even alittle bit of young apple and pear. Then comes the hops. While they are strong they are not over the top like some other ipa's ive had. They give a quick hit, then let the rest of the flavors come, then linger. It just has something extra in it i loved. This beer coats your mouth to great extent, there is not a taste bud in your mouth that isn't going crazy. Drinkablity is very high on this beer. There is no alcohol taste so beware and it is very smooth for something as hoppy as it is. Loved it.","huhl23","Jun 30, 2011"
4.45,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy copper color with a fluffy off white head. the simcoe hops are evident in both the smell and the taste. this beer is bitter with a slightly sweet malt backbone, Like a lot of DIPAs above 9%. the mouthfeel is light to medium body, with lower than expected carbonation. overall a really good beer.","rowingbrewer","Jun 27, 2011"
4.3,5.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall, what we found to be the best thing about this brew was the blend within the aroma, and the soft, yet crisp, mouthfeel. The nose remained wonderfully true to the name with bright simcoe hops screaming at the top of their lungs, giving a nice hop to balance with some malt and musk. Upon sipping, what was more striking than the taste was, in fact, the mouthfeel. The head has huge retention, and contributes nicely to the froth and slurp of each sip, adding yet another thing to put this one over the top.","TheBrewo","Jun 26, 2011"

The foam starts about two fingers thick and leaves some incredibly thick lacing that almost coats the glass. The aroma has a distinctive hop presence indicative of Simcoe with some added citrus. The taste is similar with more hop presence and lemon and a touch of honey making for a sweet DIPA. It is less tart than I expected leaving a tingling on the center of the tongue. I really like this one, but for the price I'd take Hopslam over it.","DesMoinesMike","Jun 10, 2011"

Deep rich malts with sweet spicy hop flavor, and a bunch of alcohol swirling around. Rich biscuity caramel malts, big sticky hop bitterness. Awesome for a DIPA on the feel, smooth, high carb, medium body, aspriny finish for an extra bitter. Is this my bitter beer face?? you betcha.

The smell is very pleasant, with some fruit coming through with the hops. The taste follows pretty closely. It's sweet and hoppy at the same time. I do enjoy the mouthfeel - it's not too heavy, and has a nice, clean aftertaste. Not my favorite DIPA flavor, but very, very solid just the same. Even though nothing in particular wows me, this is a really enjoyable beer overall. I will buy another 4 pack of this the next time a fresh one is released.","DrStiffington","Apr 24, 2011"

Surely, I can see this bottle's past it's prime. I don't quite understand why Weyerbacher's date code gives this another two months of shelf life, since I bought this from a store that's rather good about following date codes. I'm surely going to seek out a fresher bottle and update this review, because this is still quite delicious six months out, even if it's not as hoppy as I'd like.","shand","Apr 23, 2011"

General sweetness overall. Taste is just as hop forward, more orange, tangerine and pine cones come through after the fact. Good malt balance here too, keeps the hops at bay to a degree, but tastes great. Some lingering bitterness but doesn't slaughter the palate. Medium low carbonation aids the drinkability. Great mouthfeel and a very attractive beer overall.","liamt07","Apr 23, 2011"

Not the most appealing color but once you taste it you'll see it's good. This beer goes through different stages it seems like at first it's hoppy and juicy, then it because more dry as you drink it. The flavor is unique amongst other IPA's. The head on the glass is great too, the lacing is very sticky. This is one of Weyerbacher's pride and joys.

3.88,-4.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to finewinemike for the chance to taste this one. I had actually had this one on tap while I was in DC last year, and remembered liking it. Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a very very dark amber color. Maybe the darkest (non black) IPA I have ever seen. Foam fills the glass, and recedes quickly, leaving a little lacing. Smell- butterscotch, some alcohol notes. Taste- bitter bitter butterscotch, followed by a bitter buttery finish. This is a bitter abusive IPA! The butterscotch flavor is overdone, and this lacks some complexity, but overall is an interesting spin on the style. I'm not sure that using Simcoe hops only was a good thing, but its interesting anyway. Mouthfeel- a teeny bit flat, a little bit syrupy.

4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured a apple cider like dirty amber with a light white foam that laced the glass. It smelled of simcoe hops (what else?) and a citrusy malty mix to give it a nice sweetness. The flavors are very well integrated. The simcoe hops and citrusy malt are near perfect together. This is also one of the smoothest DIPAs I've ever had. I definitely recommend it.","aasher","Apr 08, 2011"

First whiff is a big bold punch of citrus backed by a resinus pine and grassy quality, backbone contains a hint of sweet malt. Taste is much more piney and bitter than expected, the citrus notes are few and far between and lean more towards grapefruit, the malt is present but is pale and biscuity as opposed to carmely.

3.58,-11.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from bomber into dimpled mug. Pours a fairly hazy, deep amber body. Average sized, dense, creamy, ultra fine tan head. Aroma is like a handful of hops. Big Simcoe flavor - pine, citrus and some tropical fruit/mango. Zero malt aroma, but the hops are supposed the be the showcase here. Huge hop flavor. More pine and the aforementioned fruit - both come through in spades. Chewy caramel malt provides the requisite sweetness so that the hops can really shine through. Though the flavors are big, they don't shred aggressively like some DIPAs. Full bodied, average carbonation, lightly sticky palate. Fairly sweet up front, but it dries out considerably. Big bitter (though not harsh) hop finish.","CuriousMonk","Feb 16, 2011"

This was the first IPA I've enjoyed where my entire palate was full of taste and hop goodness. It was a little overwhelming upon the first sip, but midway through I had a great appreciation for it. The hop taste is mostly sweet potpourri on a just-beginning-to-stale white bread. Flows smooth at the roof of the mouth and leaves and little residual taste or feel on the back of the tongue - just a pinch of hop here and a pinch of bread there.

There's also some sweet yeast in there, along with what I'd characterize as a homebrewed hop sediment aroma. Like the smell, there's quite a bit of caramel malt in the taste... followed by dank hops: herby and heavy grapefruit rind. A touch of booze peeks through, along with some molasses and maybe a touch of all-spice in the finish... interesting.

First sniff was awakening. Ahhh, this is Simcoe Hops. Combo punch of Pine and Grapefruit. First taste, just as it smelled, with a faint sweetness for balance. As it warmed, so did the Alcohol. Not overbearing, just letting you know it was part of this fine brew. I remember saying """Oh my God""" several times as I sipped, while eating smoked turkey Sandwich with Russ's Famous Potato Salad.

Beneath all the hops is a sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer finishes slightly dry with an ever-lasting hop flavor. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate.

A very well balanced brew with some caramel sweetness contrasting the bitter hops. This is a very smooth drinking DIPA. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and medium bodied. Drinkability is above average.

Aroma is a piney, citrus monster that is showcasing the simcoe hops. Taste is of course a monsterous amount of bitterness upfront that eases into some of the hop flavors such as citrus, pine and a bit of a fruity/floral aspect as well. There is a minimal amount of malt sweetness that provides some support throughout this medium to heavy bodied beer. The alcohol is evident in flavor and is accented by a mild amount of carbonation. Finish is somewhat oil-like with the hop bitterness lingering in the mouth long after a sip is taken.

I would describe the taste the exact same way. The hops are in the forefront but there is a surprisingly strong caramel malt backbone. Blindfolded I would probably call this a fresh barleywine instead of a DIPA. Maybe I'm splitting hairs a little bit. Anyways the taste doesn't quite work for me, if it were a fresh barleywine I would say it needs to be aged for a while to cool off a bit. Borders on boozy at times.

TASTE Rich caramel malty base comes thru as clearly as the hops, and with exceptional balance. A subdued yet sharp bitterness up front fades gradually while fruity and floral hops notes blend with malty sweet flavors. Barely noticeable booze. Not exceptionally complex but wicked smooth and balanced. Some mild bitterness lingers. FEEL thick, rich texture. Full bodied and luxurious. Some warming, dryness in the fairly clean finish.

Translucent reddish orange with amber edges, billowing cream colored head which fades after many minutes to a one finger meringue-like cap and leaves thick clumps of lace. Smell: pine, pineapple, pink grapefruit, earthiness, fairly raw but not that explosive, big caramel in the back. Taste: pink grapefruit, tangerine, candied citrus rind, earthy pine, medicinal biterness and alcohol at the end of the sip, prevalent caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel: creamy, thick and syrupy, almost chewy. Drinkability, he says with most of a 750 left to go, is good even though it is slightly sweet and slightly rough at the end of the sip.

In the end, the aftertaste carries a subtle lingering bitterness, but not as potent as I thought it would be. I couldn't believe that this was 9% ABV. There is no striking boozy flavor at all. Mouthfeel is very smooth and coats the mouth very well. Drinks like a light syrup and delightfully so. Drinkability is high, but in moderation.

What amazed me about the flavor was how smooth the hop bitterness was, which dissolved mid-palate to wood & earthiness, and then to a dry bitterness at the finish. Especially surprising for a DOUBLE ipa; most of the double ipa's nowadays are exceedingly citrusy sweet, but not this one. Medium-bodied, fairly carbonated, and a nice dryness at the finish.

Taste was bold, huge grapefruit upfront, less sweet than it smelled, with bitter pine on the finish. Bitterness did not linger and isn't overly harsh in my opinion.

Great nose - sweet grapefruit up-front, followed by some piny/resinous hops towards the back. Flavors are more evened out than suggested by the nose - sweetness and piny quality muddle together nicely on a malty backbone and play some tricks on the palate (is it sweet, is it bitter?) - my personal preference with DIPAs is more to the sweet side of the spectrum, but this is a pretty nice compromise in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a little oily on the tongue with a fairly even amount of background carbonation that peaks a little towards the back of the tongue - not too much lingering bitterness.

It is hard to pick out any malt but there is a sense of some caramel sweetness there. Alcohol taste and warmth in the finish that has the affect of cleansing the bitterness from the palate. Has a nice soft texture and carbonation. Medium bodied. A good showcase of a single hop variety. I would of preferred some semblence of balance. High bitterness and ABV limits drinkability as well.","morimech","Aug 24, 2009"

It actually relaxes me as I take deep whiffs. The flavor is similar to the nose. Hoppy and rediculously bitter but sweet and musk like. Like pine chips might taste. Not a bad thing by any means.

The body is a rusted copper brown, with a slight haze to it. The smell is predominately grapefruit and caramel sweetness. Again, going off of memory, I distinctly recall a fatal punch of Simcoe hops the first time I had this beer which resulted in a very piney winterfresh scent. The taste is mostly grapefruit citrus, with a fair pine hop kick towards the end. In the background, caramel malts provide both balance and substance.

4.45,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I absolutely love the Simcoe hop, and Weyerbacher has done an excellent job at . I'm terribly lucky to have Pliny the Elder easily available year round, not to mention the many other great California DIPAs and IPAs. Even with all those great choices, I wouldn't hesitate to put this beer in my normal hops lineup if it were distributed out here. The Simcoe hop has a wonderfully complex flavor. It's citric, piny and floral all at once. The feel is a tad dry, but it hardly detracts. The malt backbone is able to stand up to the assault of hops and lend enough sweetness to bring out the full flavor of the hops. I'm enjoying this beer very, very much.","popery","Mar 10, 2009"

But the palate dissappoints compared to the aroma, which I have experienced not infrequently in some newcomers to the IIPA arena. The bitterness is there, but the hops are somewhat one-note.

Very chewy thick brew that bombards the palate with bitterness and hop oil. Very big ipa, but extremely one sided (obviously). It's interesting to try and get that nice simcoe taste, but in an dipa i need it coming from all angles, i need some floral, more citrus, and some balance. A true hopbomb and a good one at that, but I prefer mine a little different. Good brew, but not my style.","abents","Feb 26, 2009"

What this beer laked in a multi dimensional flavor is more than made up in its """lip smacking""" good hop impact.

Flavour is much the same as the aroma, big fruity pinapple and thick pine sap with a subtle bready malt character. The bitterness is uncompromising in its assault on your tongue, I love it.

The flavors were also big and well wounded, at first I got the bitter and nearly astringent hops bite followed by lots of orange peel, some puckering grapefruit and elements of pine before the sweet malt finally offered some balance towards the end. Big, bad, bold. The mouthfeel was slick and oily, the carbonation lively but not unpleasant, the body medium to full.

Enveloping nose, tentacles of sweet grain and oat hops combine with a dollop of honey and croissant flakes to grease it into the nostrils, pleasing orange pulp and pine oil bits, energetic without having to be bitter to achieve this. Full-bodied, does a great job of sinking into the palate without engendering heaviness. Sweet tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus create a bridge between the honey, glazed dough, oat elements and the grassy bitterness and black tea notes. For its density, very smooth and drinkable, in fact, dangerously so. Remains completely rich and full through the finish.","farrago","Jan 27, 2009"

Not sure exactly what simcoe hops are supposed to be like, but there's nothing here I identify as a big, fresh hoppiness. First taste is definitely a mouthful of hops - sharp, intense bitterness is almost spicy with vanilla and woodiness. Again not a fresh c-hop, but more of a deeper, more complex hoppiness.

All aroma is a hop bomb- super citrusy and floral, very lemony- just crazy hop presence. Fklavor is also extremely hoppy. Tons of tons of hop with just a bit of malt presence just beneath the hop to provide a bit of balance. Mouth is moderate, hoppiness leaves a lasting floral impression. Very crisp and clean feeling.

Taste is a little too bitter for my tastes, but it certainly is an IPA. Very long lingering bitterness on the tongue with some slight breadyness to both the hops and the malt. Pretty well balanced in terms of hop/malt flavor but the bitterness is quite prevalent. Mouthfeel is medium which doesn't complement the hops IMO. I'm usually against very thin IPAs but in this case I don't think it serves such a strong bittering character.

Taste is a bit sweet up front with a punch of grapefruit right at the end to balance out. Just enough carbonation to pull the residual sweetness of the tongue to leave a pleasant bitterness. An exceptionally dangerous brew considering it's alcohol content. Damn, I love that punch of hops. Growler was $16 + the glass for a total of $19.","jpaltan","Nov 23, 2008"

The aroma straight from the bottle (thats how I like it) is very strong of hops and piney and a little spicy. I took a sip and the beginning of the taste was decent, it was piney, hoppy and when the beer hit the back of my tongue it hit something that other beers haven't. I decided I couldn't just drink this one down and go for the next, I decided to drink it by little sips to keep getting that strange feeling. It was one of the harshest (in a good way) beers I have ever had. I gave it a 3.5 on the drinkability because its more the taste that drives this one, not the fact that it is beer to drink down, its meant to be savored. Overall...

Taste is surprisingly more balanced than the nose, however, that is not saying much. The flavor begins with fresh bran muffin and as the beer moves across the tongue, the hops begin to shine. White pepper lemon zest, pine resin, grapefruit juice, pure bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry and the following breath is full of bitterness again.

The aroma is sweet malt and a very nice dose of piny hops with some citrus as well. The taste starts off with smooth and sweet malt for a split second before the hops come in and blast the taste buds with a puckering bitterness. Overall, this is a very nice Double IPA that is a hop bomb that will surely crave any hop fix and completely ruin your palate. Definitely recommended to any and all hop heads out there.","cjgator3","Jun 21, 2008"

This is def one of the most aromatic brews I have ever sampled, a very complex mix of pine, citrus and a unique hint of fresh flowers (maybe that's just me, haha). The taste is bold hops, and since it is straight simcoe rather than a blend of hop varieties, the flavor is very clean. You revisit the pine and citrus here, with a touch of sugary sweetness. This brew coats your mouth with the flavors and tings the back of the throat with the hoppy bitterness. The only reason I didn't give this a higher drinkability rating is because the aroma and taste is so bold, none but the hoppiest hop heads would session this, but it is a DIPA that has to be tried. I will certainly have it again and again whenever I can, another home run from Weyerbacher.","Iceman77","Jun 14, 2008"

The hops are there, immensly, with a good, dry bitterness to them that sticks to the palate and leaves a semi-sweet fruit taste combo'ed with a good dry backbite.

The aroma is quite strong with pine notes and citrus with some spice and malt kicking down the door at the end. The taste is an explosion of hops. If you like hops this is for you it, as the beer starts with a lot of citrus and grapefruit taste. As the hops are done wacking the palate the malt sweetness comes through and balances the beer. The aftertaste leaves a nice toned down bitterness. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and creamy that leaves an light oily coating on the tongue. Easy to drink as the beer does not have a real strong bitter aftertaste to it. Great beer.","Hokies","May 17, 2008"

Plenty of toasted, caramel malt sweetness, tempering the hop bitterness thoroughly. Could be a little more on the bitter side, actually. Nice fruity esters, citrus in a Lemonheads candy kind of way. A bit of mango and sweet tangerine. Lots of oily hop flavor in the finish, providing a balanced bitterness to the heavy, underlying malt sweetness. Just enough carbonation to keep the huge body moving across the palate. Just a hint of an alcohol bite in the finish, lingering with a piney hop aftertaste.

A bit of dark mineral based malt is there twords the end of the palate, it includes a dry nuttiness that develops on the end also.

Alcohol is evident as in every Weyerbacher beer. Apparently they have a hard time hiding the alcohol in their beers... There is nothing citrusy or grapefruity about this beer.

Flavor is off-the-charts piney, almost evergreen hops (I guess those are the simcore hops?). Sort of a mild drying undercurrent then a more biting conclusion. Not much malt character at all. Mellow grassiness at the beginning of a sip, then a huge smack of pine again. Is it too much? Not sure. But it's unique, so points for that. No real alcohol flavor either in the face of the huge hops. Body is solid, although maybe could have done with a little thicker.

A decent sized creamy head showed itself very briefly and settled into a thin blanket of head that stayed for the whole beer. This beer leaves big sheets of lacing on the walls of my pint glass. The floral notes in the nose are intense for this offering. Heavy scents of wooded pine, grapefruit rind, and cannabis. The first flavors bring on a dry pine bitterness offset with a sweet caramel malt base and secondary flavors of citrus and orange rind. This is unlike, in a good way, any other DIPA I've tasted as of yet. This beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation on the mouthfeel, and does leave a very dry sensation on the finish. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable. The drinkability is very nice on this beer, and I would gladly purchase again if this were available to me in my state.","TheodorHerzl","Feb 10, 2008"

The malt is sweet and strong enough to be tasted of the simcoe but balanced enough not to take over. As it flows further in your mouth and down your throat the hops take full charge again and eclipse the malts. You can feel the bitterness bite the sides of your tongue. There is even a slight metallic bitterness that starts off the aftertaste. You are left with the residual sweetness of the malts playing nicely with the hops in the warm glow of the higher ABV.

Citrus fruit, alcohol, and more hops finished this beer off strong. Mouthfeel detected a crisp, medium body that packed one hell of a mouth-puckering, bitter finish. It went over well at first, but eventually wore out the tastebuds a bit. All in all, Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe is amazingly complex, flavorful, and (despite the 9% ABV) quite easy to drink...if it weren't so expensive, I'd have one every week.","wagenvolks","Aug 28, 2007"

There is a very light carbonation in the brew and the hazyness is very apparent. The aroma is deep resinous, lightly peppery hop, with a thick caramel sweetness laying under it. The sweetness is prevalent and the hop really stabilizes it. Taking a sip, I find a strong and chunky caramel malt, with a peppery, earthy, and lightly juicy sweet. The flavors balance well together. Mouthfeel is thick with a lighter carbonation. There is a touch of slickness in there too. The alcohol somewhat comes through in the flavor as a spicyness, but it is not too strong. Overall, this one really drinks nicely. There is a touch of warming in it that I think is good for the brew. I would have this one again.","kmpitz2","Jul 24, 2007"

Aroma is rich with pine-like resins and leafy hoppiness; malt seems hidden other than a flickering of sweetness, but it has to be there. Upon sipping, the sweetness certainly comes out, like a bursting ruby red grapefruit. Definitely hoppy all the way to the dry finish, but juicy at the same time. The mouthfeel is pretty tame for a 9%er, plenty of carbonation to keep it spritzy on the tongue, but you can tell it's a bit thicker than your average IPA due to sticky lips.

It's an opportunity to showcase the nuances of a single variety and helps the beer enthusiast better understand how to tell the difference between hop types. It's like a varietal IPA. BUT... making a varietal hop monster almost defeats that purpose. Sure, Simcoe hops are delicious in their own right, and Weyerbacher has created a very good beer, but I still feel that it falls short of what it really could be if an ounce of restraint were exercised. Double Simcoe is a hop bomb in every sense of the definition. Lots of ba-boom, but not much precision.","EPseja","Jul 06, 2007"

Obvious citrus flavoring with a good floral punch. A nice bready malt aftertaste balances this out quite well for such a hop bomb.

I read where this strain is a recent development and it put me in mind of a recent Lew Bryson blog in which he was expressing incredulousness over a marijuana-related site's review of various strains in the same terms as we use for hops. They are of the same family, actually, and the sticky lacing put me in mind of some Hawaiian that I had as a kid. The mouthfeel was almost hot with its combination of alcohol and hops, but I really dug it. I am not a session beer guy.

Quite fruity with citrus, cherries, and a slight meatiness.Not sweet at all, which is a nice change of pace from many dipas. Relatively thin mouthfeel, but not so much so that the hops aren't supported. This probably slightly decreases the mouthfeel score but slightly increases the drinkability.

Poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a nice copper color with a fairly thick head. A little lacing was apparent. Aroma was citrusy, mostly grapefruit. The taste was intensely hoppy (grapefruit). This was an in your face blast; loved it. It had a resinous, oily mouthfeel. Great beer.

Strong citrus/pith pine dominate the flavor, with undertones of caramel malt, just enough to support the strong hop character. No alcohol flavor present, though a bit of alcohol warming is there. A pretty well-balanced beer, though it's fefinitely hop-forward. On the lighter side of medium bodied. All this makes for a surprisingly drinkable beer for the ABV etc. A solid double IPA, and I can see getting this from time to time.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 15, 2007"

The taste is thats a spicy meat-eh-ball-eh! Lots of citrus and VERY bitter, with a citrus rind bitter finish. You know, I never thought Id be saying this but I think its actually TOO bitter. The bitterness is a little overwhelming and in my opinion masks the other admirable qualities of the beer a bit. It has a medium body, oily texture and moderate carbonation. This one definitely grew on me as the bottle went down. Fabulous aroma, but while I know the Double IPA is a beer for the hophead, balance shouldnt suffer as a result.

The aromatics of this beer were amazing. It had that signature Pacific coast aroma of citrus and pine while at the same time displaying a very distinct pungent earthy tone. At first, this seems to be just another 'west-coast' style DIPA, but then the Simcoe comes through. A very pungent, almost blue cheese flavor that was balanced out by some residual sweetness. Mouthfeel was great. Very sticky and viscous from the hops. Surprisingly drinkable - you would never guess the 9% if it weren't on the label.

At first the aroma is oily and soapy/perfumy with sweet malts, but I soon find passionfruit, strawberry/raspberry, grapefruit, and a cedary/woody character. A very unique smelling hop I must say. There are lots of sweet malts on the palate, making the mouthfeel almost syrupy, but the hops do their damnedest to balance, contributing all the same flavors with the addition of earthy and piney qualities. It is smooth and quite full from the start, like a barleywine, with medium carbonation and a long finish. Overall an above average DIPA, but I was expecting more of a hop bomb, as the malts are a bit too prevalent and sweet for it to be one of the very best.","mmmbeer","Nov 18, 2006"

Lots of bitterness in this one as well as lots of citrus and pine hop flavors. The bitterness lingers on the palate. Not as extreme as some I've had, but it's pretty hoppy.

The flavor is somewhat sweet, with a lot of citrus. Pretty good warming sensation from the alcohol. The hops really kick in at the hind-taste, with a prominent bitterness. All of the balance goes out the window in the finish, which slides into a long-lasting resiny, bitter hop flavor. The beer is a little grainy, with some tannin qualities and astringency, but its not unfitting. Moderate carbonation and fairly pretty full body.

Aromas of passionfruit initially, with more piney and minty notes coming out at higher temperatures. Very bitter up front, but with quite a bit of balancing malt sweetness, followed by an alcoholic burn and astringent hop note toward the end that somehow mesh together really well. The finish is long and active on the tip and sides of the tongue. Fairly big carbonation fills the mouth at the mid-palate, along with a thick slickness. Overall, this is excellent stuff: thick, slightly sweet, quite bitter, with both elements balancing each other for the most part. Thick, satisfying malts and an interesting hop join to create a very interesting, satisfying beer. Very well done.","geexploitation","Nov 08, 2006"

4.17,2.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"I knew that Simcoe hops were quite smooth, but I am definitely impressed by how smoothly fruit focused this hop is. Sure it is in fact a hop so it does have some of that raw hop character, but comparatively to many other varieties it is down right mellow (especially in the amounts that must have been used for this beer). Really a lingering, lightly green, tannic note that just mouth coatingly sticks around is what tells me that a lot of hops were used in this brew. This is definitely enjoyable, and regardless of the outcome, I will always be a fan of a beer that so boldly show-cases the effects of a single hop variety. Simcoe is a perfect candidate for something as big as a one hop Double IPA, it is so smooth, yet at times I wonder if that raw, aggressive hoppiness that other varieties contribute is not missing from this brew. Regardless, this has shown me that my choice of Simcoe in the hop mix of my own brews is a good choice and will require further experimentation.","Gueuzedude","Nov 02, 2006"

First sip=citrus hop flavor right off the bat and that Simcoe Grapefruit flavor kicks in also. A thick resinous mouthfeel-almost sticky as the malt is felt not really tasted yet. A good froth sweetens the brew and releases a different bitterness as some of the citrus fades and a more astringent hop flavor emerges and stays to the finish, very nice. As this IPA warms up, the malt flavors are more evident. A sweet malt flavor is tasted and caramel flavors are ther albeit subtle.

And as expected, the hop kick comes through in the first sip...despite the 9.0 ABV, the brew is very well-balanced; it's very warming going down, but bounces back with a citrus aftertaste, masking the alcohol very nicely.

It's not the IBUs, it's not the abv, but something is awry, and I don't like it. Again, I love Simcoe hops, (check out the Dreadnaught for a wonderful example), and I've made some wonderful homebrew with them.

The head is so creamy it almost feels like sucking whipped cream off the top of the beer. The aroma has a good bit of hop florals with maybe a touch of pine and a touch of malt sweetness. The first sip presents alcoholic sweetness immediately challenged by a smooth bitterness. A ton of hop flavor, almost sweet in nature (ever had EK Golding tea? Reminds me of that natural hop sweetness) but then there's the resinous bitterness that lingers behind. Alcoholic warmth is also noted, but not in a burning or overpowering way. Mouthfeel is solid, and supports the bold flavors of this beer very well. Drinkability only suffers because it is a 9% ABV beer, and it doesn't try to hide it at all.

I left the room for a moment, and when I got back I could smell it from across the room! The taste is very diverse and comes in stages, but is nicely balanced throughout. The first thing you get is a sweet, appley, piney front, a nice warm and rich hop kick on the middle, and a great mellow malt finish. It has a great body in the mouth, which seems more balanced by the hops than it is by the carbonation. This beer has a huge kick to it, but it really does go down well.

The head maintains a rocky mountain cap all the way down. Huge floral and pine aromas waft around the glass and are noticeable from a distance. Fresh and citrus rind crisp as well. Inviting. Bold and brash initially, the pine and rind hits big and powerfully. The ample malt body provides a complimentary sweetness and girth into the finish which is filled with fresh oily rind notes. The hops are resinous and juicy and there is a slightly numbing effect, but this does not impact negatively. There is no hint of the alcohol and the finish is perpetual, leaving me to think I'll be tasting this one tomorrow as well. Full bodied and with minimal carbonation, the luscious silky smooth mouthfeel is almost cask-like. Not sessionable, but why would you? This is a beer to be savored and enjoyed as it is delicious, delectable and absolutely a must find.","hopsaplenty","Jul 13, 2006"

The malts actually override the hops here -- which is saying a lot since the hop content is pretty steep. Regarding those hops, the Simcoes deliver on what they promise: juicy, resinous (piney) flavor with minimal harsh bitterness. Maybe my palate has been trained to actually like the brashness of high-cohumulone hops, or maybe I just think that the rather cloying candy-sweetness of this beer could benefit from some bitterness, but I'm not really feeling this one more than simply as an experimental single-hop beer.

By no means a hit or miss brewery I just go with what I like and try everything new from 'em that I can. The only beers bottled beers I'm missing are the Imperial Pumpkin and the Decadence, anywho back to this fine brew it appears a copper amber hue that forms a massive cream colored head and melds into an impressive biscuit looking texture floating atop my brew leaves behind thick even streaks of lacing with each sip. Aroma contains deep earthy, piney, and grapefruit citrus layers with a spiced bready notes and just a dousing of alcohol, some newbie would probably consider this beer to be soapy but anyway you slice it I like the varietal IPA trend. Flavor consists of a sugary sweet doughy malt layer paired with ample resinous hop flavor fresh from the vine, herbal, citrus, pine, and a bit of funky earthiness all come across the palate. Evident but not overwhelming with the 9% alcohol toasty caramel nut with fruity highlights in the malt department such a good mix great DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium to full body range with enough sticky-ickiness to put a smile on my face even a gentle natural carbonation here as well. Drinkability...extremely flavorful yet refreshing and oh so tasty will bring on a parade of hop burps and it forces me to crave another, good thing I snagged four bottles of this lovely brew.","WVbeergeek","Jun 26, 2006"

The taste is dominated by fresh, juicy hop flavors, though there is a mild malt character for balance. Somewhat creamy and smooth in my mouth with a lingering bitterness that turns slightly sour. Crips and bursting with flavors of hops and tropical fruits. A very good example of this style with enough hops to please hop lovers.

Bubblegum and pine in the aroma, which also define the initial flavors of this one, and something about this is clearing my sinuses. Yow. Unbelievably herbal and eccentric in its tree-like pine and spruce flavors, and the bitterness throughout is cutting and abrasive. Not a flavor profile for the weak or uninitiated! Luckily, I am neither and certainly enjoy its soapy bitterness. Subtle juicy citrus notes in the middle, while the finish continues to be leafy, resiny and herbal with notes of black pepper. Mellow carbonation. This is not your typical American Double IPA brimming with juicy grapefruits and Cascades. This is tongue puckering bitter with a seriously interesting, unique and overpowering hop profile. This is not for those who smother themselves in weaksauce. I can dig it.","IrishRedRock","Jun 21, 2006"

The taste carries a sweet grapefruit hop tang with an earthy and bready finish with nice lingering bitteness. A bit strong in alcohol, but it doesn't detract any. Thickness is between light and medium, and it has a slight syrupy feel. Carbonation is adequately light. I very much enjoyed this brew, the taste never gets too sweet, nor overly sour leaving a nice balance of flavors worth experiencing again.","bennetj17","Jun 21, 2006"

Touch of lingering sweetness in the finish.Good body-dry finish leaves the tongue a bit parched! Overall a very enjoyable beer. The whole package is very well done.

Solid bitterness with a strong unsweetened grapefruit juice character. Caramel malt was apparent at first, but faded as hops grew into the finish and lingered for some time. Fairly balanced though for an over the top beer, with a bit of warmth in the finish. Creamy texture with moderate carbonation and some hop dryness.

Golden amber pour with very nice, lingering lace. But man, those Simcoes. Piney, citrusy, extremely aromatic. This is one extreme beer and if you're the least bit hop-shy, stay away because not only will Simcoe bitch-slap you, but he'll bend you over and pound you like he hasn't seen a woman in years.

Taste was just as good or better. Incredible flavors of apricots, peaches, mango, hop bitterness and grapefruit. Also present is a good malty, caramelly flavor that complements the hoppiness perfectly. Alcohol is there, but barely evident. Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy on the palate.

4.35,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall- A nice big flavorful D-IPA that doesn't finish off as dry as I was hoping. It almost completely disguised the alcohol, but otherwise a good offering from Weyerbacher and an IPA I would like to try on tap!","NJpadreFan","May 18, 2006"
4.12,1.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"While I will probably never be a fan of this style (super hopped IPA's)which seems to be running rampant across the country, I really think Double Simcoe is an excellent, well crafted ale. It may be due to it being a single hop variety ale, letting its individual characteristics stand out and be appreciated. I generally did not like the Hops Infusion, with its advertised 7 varieties, for example.","alehopman","May 13, 2006"
4.27,5.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer is about as basic as a hefty IPA can get, and its biggest strength lies in its simplicity. The concise list of ingredients combine to lend good depth, and it is a pleasure to drink. The ABV is a real warmer, but I never truly noted it until I felt it in my head after drinking a fair quantity, so beware. Still, it drinks smooth and easy, straightforward and full-flavored. It goes to show that there's plenty of fun in fundamental beer crafting.","Foxman","May 11, 2006"
4.5,10.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is an exceptional beer. I liked weyerbacher's beers before this, but this has to be by far the best they have made. From the pour on it looks awesome. It is a solid amber with a large fluffy whit head which displays incredible lacing. The smell is foward of fruity, floral hops which i think the simcoe hop gives a little extra diversity. It is balanced perfectly by the malts. You can just tell this is going to be a good one. The taste is wonderful. There is an explosion of flavor on the tip of the tongue. Hops, citrus fruits, maybe even alittle bit of young apple and pear. Then comes the hops. While they are strong they are not over the top like some other ipa's ive had. They give a quick hit, then let the rest of the flavors come, then linger. It just has something extra in it i loved. This beer coats your mouth to great extent, there is not a taste bud in your mouth that isn't going crazy. Drinkablity is very high on this beer. There is no alcohol taste so beware and it is very smooth for something as hoppy as it is. Loved it.","mattpetti","May 09, 2006"

4.8,18.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Anyone who has written off Weyerbacher for any reason needs to go out and buy this, a new Hops Infusion, some Blithering Idiot, and some aged QUAD (and Raspberry Imperial Stout) if they can find it. Good things are happening. All they need to do is an Oak aged Belgian-style pale ale (and make this a year-round 4-pk)!","yen157","May 04, 2006"
