Hopslam is sweet all-around and has a tropical fruit kind of vibe, while The Oracle has a very high level of bitterness and a completely different hop profile. I'd really like to try this beer fresh to see the hops shine like Bell's intended them to, but I'm not sure how much brighter they could be, even in this """old""" bottle. Ideally I'd like a bit more balance from The Oracle, but it is still a delicious beer.","Alextricity","Jan 13, 2015"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little syrupy. At first it's malty, bready and sweet (almost reminiscent of hopslam), followed by the punch of the citrus and heat on the back end. Pretty damn well balanced in my opinion. I read some reviews saying it had too much heat but I wouldn't say it's more than usual for a high abv dipa like this. Maybe it's because I waited a little while before drinking (I promised a good friend I'd wait til he came to town to share). Overall, this is a pretty nice offering from bells.  Unfortunately I didn't try the first go 'round of oracle for comparison but I will drink this again without hesitation.","Tex_hex","Oct 25, 2014"

Not much of an aroma, just a bit of malt and caramel. Malt is definitely the first thing you taste, then vanilla, caramel, turning to citrus then - Wham! - the hops and booze kick in. Lots of piney bitterness coats the tongue. And plenty of burn. Medium mouth that's a touch oily. Definitely not your typical DIPA, but it's pretty good.","MartzMimic","Oct 25, 2014"

Very nice nose of pine, grapefruit, tropical and a somewhat dank hop note over a caramel sweetness that also has a hint of spice.  Medium body with a rich oily slick texture.  Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish.  The flavor profile is complex and fairly well balanced given the 10% alcohol content.  It begins as a blend of hop flavors, mostly dank with grapefruit and pine notes, that slowly yield to the tropicals as a blended biscuit/caramel sweetness sneaks in. The sweetness fades into a mild bitterness which has a dank and slightly spicy note. As the bitterness fades, alcohol is noted, but not excessively so. The finish is slightly sweet with a nice alcohol burn on the back of the throat.  Better than the Mars offering which lacks balance and fails to cover the alcohol well.","tillmac62","Oct 13, 2014"

There is a deep bitter flavor with abundant citrus hops and some tropical hop notes.  The citrus notes are very heavy and leave little room for light malt backbone.  This is an assault on your tastebuds.  The mouth is a bit sticky and chewy,but considering the strength it is actually pretty easy going.","Franziskaner","Sep 27, 2014"

Like many American IPAs and what you would expect from a double IPA, the hops really dominate but the malt and the alcohol provide a nice balance. Bells demonstrates how to do a super hoppy beer – it has intense bitterness and almost comes off as an elixir with the alcohol almost adding to the bitterness – this is probably not a session beer but would make a nice aperitif beer for before or after dinner.","pat61","Sep 24, 2014"

A crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, the heat to this one really holds me back from being able to get too into this but it also wasn't enough to totally ruin it for me either.

Whereas Mars has a heavy malty profile that is light on the hops, the Oracle does a great job balancing the hops creating a great drinking beer.  The Oracle does a good job of hiding the 10% abv.  I prefer the Oracle style of DIPA over the Mars.  But try them both to see for yourselves.","McSmack","Sep 16, 2014"

It’s not quite as bombastic as some, and maybe not as rich as others, but as you’d expect from Bell’s this beer is well-crafted, very refined, and it integrates all of its different elements seamlessly. In terms of its hops profile, it trends toward dank and grassy, but definitely retains some citrusy character. It’s not lopsidedly hoppy like most DIPAs today, nor is it too malty, but it still doesn’t come off as “balanced” so much as it comes off as nuanced. The hops/malt balance is subtle and refined, and the way it hides its booze is telling—it’s just a refined, well-crafted DIPA. Great job.","fmccormi","Sep 05, 2014"

The taste is slightly boozy on the top but is covered well by the citrus hop that stays with you till midway though then the pine and booze finish it out. Feels lighter in the mouth than most dipas but still had a nice hop oil feel. Overall it was a solid beer. I am looking forward to seeing how well it ages.

Aroma certainly hints at a high ABV, but hides the booze fairly well behind a wall of orange, tangerine, lime, pineapple, and floral hops.  Just a bit of caramel under it all.  Flavor is hoppy and smooth...juicy citrus bitterness, pine resin stickiness, melon, peach, and apricot.  Malt presence is low, contributing a touch of residual sweetness for balance.  Creamy, bitter mouthfeel finishes dry and leaves a warming sensation in the throat.  Pretty nice overall, I'm glad the residual sugars are held at bay.","wedge","Sep 01, 2014"

4.25,1.7,,,,,,"Enough looking backwards into the past! I Pop!ped the cap, began an aggro pour and sat back as a pseudo-cascade morphed into three fingers of dense, rocky, eggnog-colored head with frightening retention. I had already angered The Oracle and I had no one to blame but myself, since #TheOldLady has repeatedly voiced her displeasure with regard to how I pour beer (among other things). I watched in awe as it settled, producing sticky lacing that only one of Zeus' thunderbolts would be capable of removing. Color was solid Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity, but since we were going Greek today, only Midas and Croesus appeared before me. Usually, I discount their nonsense, but I was also in the presence of The Oracle and I did not want to incur her wrath. I fell to my knees and held the chalice out to them from the position of a humble supplicant. As I did so, I caught a whiff of its nose, a majestic smell, like an entire pine forest had been felled and jammed into the bottle. It was actually NE-plus clarity because this time, The Oracle was going to look into my future! I felt faint. I began to fall backwards when Croesus reached out and grabbed me, bringing the chalice to my lips that I might also partake. I suddenly realized that they respected me, which is why they routinely showed up in my kitchen. I had been mocking them, wrongheadedly, and I vowed to embrace each of them on their next visit. The mouthfeel was a thick and viscous as honey. There was an initial burn on my tongue, followed by a glorious wash of hops and my eyes opened wide. The Oracle was somehow in my psyche and I saw my entire future laid out before me and I understood why mortals should not dabble in such arcane arts! I wanted to forget everything that I had seen, but there was no turning back. I was to become a King Midas of hops. Everything that I would touch after a certain point would become laced with hops! My tongue fell from between my lips and lolled around, overwhelmed by the intensity of the hops inherent in this beer. It was not meant for mortal consumption and yet The Oracle, Midas and Croesus had seen fit to confer me with some of it. The finish was as dry as the desert islands of Alonissos and as my throat constricted, I fell back, into Midas' arms only to awake on my living room couch. Was it all just a dream-like vision or did I really drink this beer? Only Pythia knows for sure!","woodychandler","Aug 29, 2014"

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pinapple, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a moderately slick/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and fairly smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 24, 2014"

3.5,-16.3,,,,,,"Deep yellow pour with a huge white head that holds on for a long time. Hoppy - citrus aroma. Taste is grapefruit style citrus with a ton of hops and bitterness from the beginning till the end. Almost like a non coated pill that gets stuck on your tongue. A bunch of pine too. Very slick resiny feel to it. I know my rdev is going to be way off on this an I am in the minority, but for a DIPA, I find this to be very unbalanced and not real enjoyable. As an American IPA, it I would score differently. If you like an IBU slap to the face then go for it for sure. Bell's makes some great beers. They have always been hit or miss with me though. This one is a miss personally.","WesMantooth","Aug 22, 2014"

3.53,-15.6,,,,,,"I don't know, I much prefer Hopslam, and I don't even like that beer all that much. It's kind of the polar opposite of this, within the DIPA style. This, for me, isn't a very enjoyable beer to drink - it's just not DELICIOUS, and I don't want to drink beer that isn't delicious anymore. I love hoppy beer but the bar has been set a lot higher in recent years and the Oracle doesn't come up to it for me. There are brewers crafting high ABV DIPAs that have explosive hop flavors packed with appealing notes while bitterness is mitigated somewhat. A beer like that doesn't need a pronounced malt character because the hops are handled so artfully and can be left to shine. In this case, the malt backbone is sorely missed, and everything feels out of whack and a little...dated?","tobelerone","Aug 20, 2014"

3.91,-6.5,5,4,3.5,4,4.25,"Overall: Wow. Just wow. I did not know what to expect coming into this beer, but Hopslam this is not. This is without a doubt the most bitter beer I have ever drank, and I’ve had Palate Wrecker, Ruination, Abrasive, Arctic Panzer Wolf, Double Sunshine, Resin, etc. Mark this down as the only beer I have ever had trouble finishing alone due only to the bitterness. I would say that this is the hop-lover’s dream, but I am a hop lover, and this was still too much. With a more assertive malt bill, Oracle could really shine; it need not be totally balanced or anything, but some semblance or hint of balance has got to make itself known. The beer is top notch in craftsmanship and to style (if ultra-bitter DIPA is a style), but when I have trouble finishing a 12 oz. of this and can put down bombers of Arctic Panzer Wolf with no trouble, well, there might be a problem. Looking at other reviews, I feel like there must be a lot of bottle variation with this beer, since I got almost nothing but resin, but others note ample tropical fruit. Regardless, in summation, seek this out if you are a masochist. 16.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Oct 10, 2013"

Medium-full body with wallops of hop flavor and hop bitterness. The hop notes linger extensively. Resin in nose and on the palate. Muted malt. This is a hop-heads delight - and it is moreish to boot. Well-developed Belgian lace. The ABV is noticeable, although hiding a bit behind the hop notes. Sweet, warming, bitter, deliciousness. May age well. Wonderful with food - particularly rich foods. Cuts, cleanses, lifts, and brightens. I will seek to find some more.","carlborch","Sep 05, 2013"

3.55,-15.1,4,4,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its nose. Really, all the aromatic goodness presented here came with warmth. It started a bit hot and overly malty, much like the flavoring, but it took a turn with warmth, where the hops were allowed to flourish into their natural, sticky, floral, and piney state. This gave a sweet air to it, helping to contrast nicely with the grain and the fusel booziness. We found the taste, however, to be a bit cumbersome. Here we found extreme hotness of ethanol, overly bittered hops, and biting, metallic yeast, mixing for a rather heavy puck and chalked astringent on the feel. This was not helped by the fact that the body was sturdy and thick, adding to the burden of drinking it. Perhaps it was the hype that killed this one for us, but unfortunately we found The Oracle to be overly boozed, deceptively unbalanced, and more of a chore than an absolute pleasure.","TheBrewo","Aug 25, 2013"

A hint of grassiness that ties it all together. Actually quite grassy as it warms. Great fresh citrus flavor. Bitter pine. Lemons possibly. Nice malt comes through in the finish without being sweet.

Flavor is hoppy, resiny, with some finishing sweetness to balance the bitterness. Mouthfeel is very satisfying; medium-heavy with appropriate carbonation.

Lots of dank, bitter citrus fruits (grapefruit, tangerine, lime, mango) and pine on the nose with a hint of sweetness. They aren’t lying when they say this is a west coast style ipa. Taste starts with lots of dankness, grapefruit, mango, tangerine. Middle brings a nice sweetness and just the tiniest bit of breadiness. The hops just overshadow the malt. Finish is tons of resinous pine, lots of grapefruit, some tangerine, lemon, booze. Warming sensation as it goes down. Definitely a hop forward beer, but there is a slight breadiness and carmel note in it from the malt. Full body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. A hophead’s dream.","brewskis","Aug 16, 2013"

The nose had me thinking it would be a bit more complex on the palate. I'm not disappointed, but I wouldn't be far off to say that I potentially expected a bit more from this one - partially because of the extreme limited amount distributed out and the hype surrounding it, which ultimately led to a crazy chase. It's a really solid brew, and I'd love to have a fresh one every season, but it didn't stick out enough for me to drive all around town trying to find a single 12oz bottle again.

4.22,1,5,4.75,3.75,4.25,4.25,"Amazing color and head to this beer! Perfect golden amber with a touch of orange. Head is two full fingers high and has been staying for three full minutes so far. Aroma is wonderful as well. Tons of orange peel, lightly piney, with some mango notes as well. Five minutes and the head has a small dent in it. I haven't even taken a sip yet. First sip and I'm a bit let down from the aroma and appearance. Taste is overly hopped. Like Bell's was trying to go west coast with this beer. The sweet citrus in the aroma turns into piney sweet hops in the taste. Mouthfeel is great though, and the lacing has been wonderful.","mverity","0"

3.58,-14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Finally getting to lay my tastebuds on this elusive DIPA. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, pine needles, honey, and sickly-sweet caramel. The taste pretty much brings in more of the same, but now everything is more powerful: The grapefruit is heavier, the pine is sharper, the caramel is sweeter. It's all a bit much, especially when the sweetness and the pine mix together to form a mild menthol kind of character in the finish. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick feel. Overall, a solid DIPA, but one that seems to be too big for its own britches. I'd drink another, if only to figure out where the fanfare for this beer comes from, especially when a slightly more refined version can be more easily obtained (at least, in these parts) in the form of HopSlam.","TMoney2591","Oct 14, 2012"

What I liked most about this beer was just about everything, it smelled great, tasted great, and looked great. What I liked least about this beer was the drinkability, it was just a little to intense and one 12oz bottle is just enough. I would buy this beer again next time it's release, but I think I would only buy 1 or 2, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys big and intense Double IPA's. All in all I was glad I finally got to try this beer and it lived up to my expectations, it was a big and intense Double IPA that just wrecked my palate, good job Bell's this beer is like Hop slams angrier and bitterer older brother.","StoutHunter","Sep 17, 2012"

3.7,-11.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Courtesy of 2BDChicago. 10588 PKGD 8/12/11 indicated on the back label. Served in a tulip at 51 degrees. Pours a brownish-orange hue with a mostly translucent clarity; just a slight haze. Head is a quarter inch, frothy and off-white and eventually settles into a broken slick and a bubbly band around the shoulders. Thick, cascading bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose primarily expresses light toasted malts, a suggestion of ethanol and a piny/citrusy/earthy character; however, there's also a trace of tropical fruit in the foreground. Taste reveals an earthy/piny bitterness, as well as caramel and a buttery character along a malty backbone. That said, the considerable alcohol presence makes it difficult to parse out the nuances of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a slightly oily consistency and a prickly carbonation. There's also a light acidity and some residual alcohol heat. Overall, I think this beer could use a little more time in the cellar. Alcohol is a bit too over the top and really muddles the flavors. It's not bad, but I prefer a little more balance and sweetness in my DIPAs.","Jwale73","Jan 04, 2012"

Surprisingly light aroma for such a hoppy beer, as the hops punch you in the face upon first taste and don’t let go. It’s chewy, with a big piney bitterness and a squeezed grapefruit, even after four months, followed by some honey sweetness. Without any point of reference I’d say it’s held up well—and I’d love to try this fresh. Be careful, it’s 10%!","elNopalero","Jan 02, 2012"

Great aroma, tons of citrusy and resinous hops, grapefruit and oranges, pineapple and tropical fruit character. Great flavour too, sugary malts balance out the big, citrusy hop profile (basically the same as in the aroma) and kept the sturdy bitterness in check. A bit of alcohol warmth rounded things out. Full bodied with lowish carbonation, very smooth texture. Overall, an excellent beer and one of my favourite big IPAs in recent memory.","DrJay","Beers"

Makes the beer simply fun to drink in small sips to maximize the number of times your put your nose in the glass. Oily resin and pine--my fav in a DIPA--in the taste--and pleasantly blistering bite that lingers to the point of just about but not quite overwhelming the taste buds. Dry aftertaste. Get this one if you haven't yet. Two months in the fridge and still going strong.

It really really is like an imperial two-hearted ale, with the caramel malt and touch of centennial hops really shining through. As others have said, might be closer to a barley wine than a DIPA. Not that bad, but not as advertised.","znichols","Oct 28, 2011"

The hops never quite make a comeback and as a result the finish is sweet and boozy. Feel is thick and sticky with a low level of carbonation.

Pours a deep copper color with a bright slightly off white head leaves fine even bands of lacing. Sorry Hopslam fans no honey additions in this one, but the nose is full of citrus fruit and mild pine and bark. Sugar coated hops come about with each sniff this is some serious hop candy. Flavor dawns me with a spicy mild herbal bitter dank citrus fruit peel tone. Hints of bright caramel for a second followed by a candied hop garden, kissed with warming alcohol while the beer is still pretty chilled. Mouthfeel has warming alcohol, with a touch of hop oils going smooth with even carbonation. Overall I'm loving the hops in this one I could use this with less alcohol and the same hop profile sweetness is ample not over played a pretty balanced midwest hop monster.","WVbeergeek","Sep 30, 2011"

The malts are fairly transparent and the mouthfeel doesn't give you anything to chew on.

3.65,-12.7,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,3,"D/O: There is frequently a point in the development of a DIPA when the line gets crossed, where a well-intended project goes off the rails. This beer walks that line, and it is not clear to the drinker which side of the line it is on. It is best appreciated by the nose, with some of the suggested qualities showing up in the taste but in the presence of a whole handful of other, less appealing flavors. This is one of the most spirituous DIPAs encountered that manages to remain some kind of drinkable. It is intense, and that intensity does take a toll on the palate--due to the extreme bitterness as well as the often hot alcohol presence. While not endearing, it does offer the DIPA enthusiast a point of reference for the comparison of Bell's other hoppy beers.","beagle75","Sep 25, 2011"

Too much in the grapefruit and pine hop department and not enough of the sweeter citrus or tropical fruit flavors. I could and would not want more than 1 or 2 of these in a sitting because of the apparent alcohol flavors that emerge and the rather generic intense hop bitterness and flavor profile.

This beer doesn't need to rest on any hop-pun name, its quiet and quaint appearance is backed by its incredible taste. Only down-side: its even more rare and limited than Bells spring DIPA release, and because of this was limited to one bottle per customer where I picked it up, at 3.50.

Over the top sweet pineapple juice swoons the tastebuds as you get slapped around by hops and surprised with a hint of chocolate and dark fruit. Some DIPAs really straddle the barley wine line, but this one just hints at it perfectly while maintaining a great IPA personality.

There is a slight medicinal smell I pick up though. The taste of piney resin is encountered first and then this wired cough syrupy type burn that happens right when I go to swallow.

4.01,-4.1,5,4,4,3.5,4,"The Oracle came to me in the glass a dark gold color with spots of a orange with red as well. Not the brightest DIPA. A nice amount of frothy white foam on top that left spraypaint lace. Smell was very piney with a underlining citrus fruit appeal. Apparently dry hopped with god knows what. The smallest amount of malt once the glass is almost done and room temp is reached. Sipping this I was floored by the flavor. This is a DIPA with mad hop presence and not so much of the extra malt found in doubles. This leads to a very bitter pine taste up front in the middle with some citrus afterwards when everything is said and done. The pine sap is bursting out of here. Feel is a strong medium with a very resinous feel down the gullet. It's carbed up nicely but bitter and lasting almost forever. The Oracle is no joke, a DIPA in every sense of the word yet a bit unbalanced and not insanely drinkable. I wanted another one but it would of wrecked my palate into oblivion.","BARFLYB","Jul 14, 2011"
4.7,12.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub during their recent anniversary celebration. I love this beer. When a double IPA is done right, then for me it's a thing of beauty, and this example is hitting on all cylinders for my taste buds. Pours a nice dark orange amber with a nice head that fades to a thin cap. Very nice lacing with distinct bands of lace down the glass as you drink. The aromas are a nice blend of hops, starting with what smells like Summit and others layered on. Good herbaceous notes with a touch of green onion, dill, and even lactic notes- which is all hop driven. These notes develop more into the direction of pine and pepper with some clean, pure malt underneath as a base, and some tropical fruit right at the end. I always like multi-note hop presence, particularly a layered experience like this. The taste, if anything, is even better. Beautifully balanced hops with pine, bitter citrus, and herbal flavors that are particularly strong on dill and tanginess. There are also developing tastes of more pine, spice, earth, and very firm malt. Overall, you get a blast of hops with a fla vor progression starting with citrus and cycling through pine, herbs, spice, earth, and a late pine finish and long bitterness throughout. Very full and flavorful, but not hot in the least and very drinkable. Fantastic beer, but I will say that if you're not a fan of the more herbaceous styles of hops, you might not find it quite as enjoyable as I did.","Georgiabeer","Jul 11, 2011"

The pour of the beer was a nice copper color. The head faded really quickly and didn't leave much lacing at all. The smell of the beer was wonderful, lots and lots of citrus on the nose. Not quite as good of an aroma as HopSlam but close. The taste was a citric pine tartness with a sweet dry aftertaste. The only problem I had with the beer was it's mouthfeel.

3.84,-8.1,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"OVERALL: The first few sips were not exactly tough to get down, but shortly after I began drinking The Oracle it became extraordinarily easy to drink. A nice dry finish and aftertaste combined with a complex, flavorful and slightly sweet flavor up front make this a tough beer to let go of. Like most good DIPAs, this is dangerously drinkable. As a side note, it's almost a shame that Bell's makes it. If it was another brewer's top DIPA, it would likely get a lot more attention, but I think it gets overshadowed by Hopslam.","StoneTSR","Feb 14, 2011"

4.07,-2.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"The mouthfeel is oily as expected, but not overly so. Medium-low carbonation helps to beef up the body into the midrange.

There's certainly no shortage of bitterness, and the pine simmers steadily, but all the hoppy goodness is somewhat blunted by the malt. Some citrus juiciness approaching the swallow. Medium-thick bodied, with the booze showing up basically in the finish only. Very impressive job of controlling the booziness and sweetness at this ABV.

The flavors do not flow well, but are more jagged and spiking. Very bitter, and lingering, but the linger leaves a bad taste. The citrus is nice, but the alcohol chimes in with an unpleasant burst. As it warms it becomes more palatable, but the lingering aftertaste is still not very enjoyable. The feel is nice and smooth, slightly creamy, and on the upper end of light. Carbonation is nice.

Not bright, high, but deep and harmonious. In more real terms, there is a higher malt presence that plays with the hops much more so than with Hopslam. This is like Hopslam's older, wiser relative.

The aroma is the biggest disappointment for me as it is rather mild and restrained compared to the rest of the experience with this beer. Mild grapefruit and other sweet citrus with a light sugary bubblegum note. Not much of a malt presence or even particularly fresh hop bite to the aroma. Flavor on the other hand is very strong and lacking much nuance, but that doesn't really bother me when it nails what I want from the style so well. From the onset the flavor is smooth, potent citrus and tropical fruit hoppy and amino acid blend with a strong warming alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is perfect; thick, smooth, creamy and a long lasting citrus rind and biting hop finish.

Really pick up on that sweet/tart tropical fruit right off but it sure does break into a exceptionally hard bitterness quickly. It really does linger after awhile too.

While sipping, lacing appears in patches all over the glass. By the end of the experience, there is still a layer of lupulin infused/stained head still sitting atop the brew. The aroma of this beer is magnificant; smelling of sweet hop goodness primarily pineapple with some hints of orange and some other fruity goodness hanging out in the background. Some minor notes of caramelized sugar comes through in the back of the nose as well with a minor sting of alcohol. Taste is bitter piney hops upfront that are very resine-like in the way the bitterness wraps itself around your tongue and just stays. Other flavors of the hops come off as being slightly herbal and earthy with some slight citrus flavor that just outright dominates the minor malt sweetness that attemps to balance out this bitter hop monster. There is a lingering flavor of hops left in the mouth long after each sip tasting both herbal and piney. Medium feel with a modest level of carbonation.

One thing I've always thought about HopSlam was that - while it had east coast tendencies, showcasing mint, some herbal notes, a few leafy overtones - it was really a hybrid in many ways, also showcasing pineapple, grapefruit, pine, and a lot of light notes. Oracle, on the other hand, knows to dance with the one who brung it. A heavy, thick, biting, and savory alternative to the fruity tooty grapefruit and """If you're going to San Fransisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair""" floral bombs, this one trends to fresh barleywine, and that's a good thing. We need more DIPAs like this, even if the 10.4% abv limits the drinkability. Please Bell's, make this an annual release. It also paired fantastically with some sharp cheddar cheese.

Strong cloudiness in the burnt orange to pumpkin colored liquid, for this sor of hue close to opaque, mild yellowing at the rims. The nose at first explodes almost purely with pink grapefruit and tangerine citrus, over time opens up room for mossy, wet herbal notes, pepper, pine resin softened by peach, mango, apricot fruit scents, the malts remain in the background, as it warms the hoppy earthiness grows in stature. Medium-bodied, the carbonation foams up a little too much at first, however, the power of the hops crush this swiftly. Sourness makes the grapefruit more white than pink, mandarin orange and a touch of lemon. Bitter herbs, grass and peat moss don't overplay their hand but keep the whole experience alert and erect, earthy and peppery. Lower dose of pine and flowers, pulls up the rear with the malts. The overall bite draws out more pineapple, papaya, green apple fruit than peach or apricot. As the bitterness recedes through the finish a touch of biscuit or cornmeal comes through. Makes a forceful statement but never raises its voice.","farrago","Dec 21, 2009"

Totally recommended if you can get your hands on one.","throwthechaff","Sep 13, 2009"
4.1,-1.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A 12 ounce bottle - batch # 9306. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The IIPA appears a hazed rich apricot color with about an inch of dense light rust colored head. The head leaves a thin lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor consist of white grapefruit juice, some resinous pine, mild hints of tropical fruit such as pineapple, herbal, caramelized malt notes, but not as sweet as I was expecting. Finish is quite dry and bitter, with the alcohol coming through as it warms. Tasty stuff.","ClockworkOrange","Sep 13, 2009"
4.5,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a very tasty, well-crafted and satisfying DIPA that delivers in all the categories. This is a very special ale that has now begun its superior legacy.","malty","Sep 13, 2009"
4.38,4.8,5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"I'm really glad Larry listened and revisited the Big Head recipe. This doesn't taste quite as good but the alcohol is a little better hidden. In any case, I hope he keeps putting out a summer DIPA for all of us hop junkies who find the year wait for Hopslam to be too much.","MasterSki","Sep 12, 2009"
4.62,10.5,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"D: Superb. A little thicker than most dIPAs of this caliber and the ABV feels somewhat high. Otherwise it would easily be a 5.","callmemickey","Sep 11, 2009"
4.2,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, I fail to see where this fits in Bell's lineup. It 90% of a Hopslam, but not as good.","BMoney575","Sep 11, 2009"
4.42,5.7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"D: The flavor is great, but there is just a little too much bitterness in this for me. If that could be toned down - and I'm thinking maybe just sitting on a bottle for a month or two might do it and this would get bumped up significantly.","dukedevil0","Sep 11, 2009"
4.89,17,4,5,5,4.5,5,"An almost creamy mouthfeel that is balanced by the drying bitterness and proper carbonation. The drinkability is dangerously high. I would drink more of this if it were not so strong and rare.","ypsifly","Sep 11, 2009"
4.82,15.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"If the nose wasn't enough to meet my hophead cravings, then the taste puts it over the top. Intense herbal hop bitterness right off the bat. Pine and mint flavors follow, as sweetish tropical fruits trickle in, forming a solid malt base. Big pineapple and mango flavors crescendo before the hops takeover for good. Strong herbal, citrus, and pine notes completely stun the palate and numb the tongue. Some candied fruit sweetness resurfaces in the otherwise dry, bitter finish, but this is all about crazy fresh hop flavor and intense bitterness. Full-bodied with a creamy feel. As much as I love Hopslam and Big Head, this is the new king of Bell's growing DIPA line-up!","alexgash","Sep 08, 2009"
4.82,15.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"The Oracle is a great addition to Bell's lineup and complements Hopslam. IMHO it is a world class DIPA that matches or exceeds the best West Coast DIPA's.","midlifec","Sep 07, 2009"
4.7,12.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"One of the nicest of this style i have had. I put this up there with the Pliney in terms of quality.","mazdarx","Sep 07, 2009"
4.23,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability- This is a nice drinking DIPA, but it's going to be difficult for me to go through the whole case with this one. Looks like I'll be attending some tastings and doing some sharing!","blakesell","Sep 06, 2009"
4.6,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Another fantastic creation by Larry Bell and co. Right up there with Big Head and Hopslam when at their peak. Speaking freshness, I think The Oracle might be a little too fresh? It'll be interesting in a month or two to see if the hops calm down some. That was the only thing holding me back from giving The Oracle a 5/5 for taste. Either way it's still an amazing brew. Word from Larry is we might see this distributed widely next year. I hope that's the case for all the hopheads out there!","heliosphann","Sep 04, 2009"
4.92,17.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall, The Oracle is outstanding. I'm so happy to get my hands on this DIPA before it's all sold out. Hopslam and The Oracle are the premier line up of DIPA's in the country. This is very tasty and very complex. Get your hands on this if you can but be careful...you may want to drink the whole six pack or case...whatever you may have.","BigAl723","Beers"
4.5,7.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Phenomenal. Simply phenomenal. Pliny the Roman, meet Pythia and the Oracle of the Greeks. Which is better? It's not my place to say, but place either on my lips and I'll never want to stop drinking.","Thorpe429","0"
