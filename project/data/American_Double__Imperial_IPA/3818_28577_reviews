"I've been on a IPA kick lately and this is my favorite. It use to be hard to find but I guess it's gaining popularity.  Hope it sticks around."
""
"Don't feel like writing a full review."
""
""
"Maybe average taste at best"
"This golden-colored DIPA is a """soft""" take on the style, which is both unusual and a little oxymoronic. I'd keep it in mind for certain occasions; perhaps a good candidate for a dessert IPA (I hear they're good with carrot cake)."
""
"Too malty for my taste, probably meant to hide the acohol, not a fan or overly malty beers.  Not impressive.  Their 2XIPA is much better, but their IPA is their best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some very odd yeasty tastes that I didn't care for. This was horrible after it warmed up a bit, but not bad at first."
""
"This was very solid. Smelled great and tasted very good."
""
""
""
"Good DIPA Definitely tastes like a amped up version of 2xipa I would be interested to know if they use the same hops and malts in both beers, either way wish I could get this in 6ers like that one!"
""
""
""

""
""
""
"First time trying this. It was bottled about 5 months ago. I mite have liked it fresh but thanks to distributors sitting on beer well past it best by date I have a malty beer that gets a bad score."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little thick, not crisp not clean. Taste a little like booze."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is big but smooth with a really drinkable feel that goes down easy but lets you know it's packing a punch."

"Alcohol comes out immediately in the aroma followed by a strong citrus and grassy hops bitterness. Alcohol prevails from start to finish, and not in a bad way. Abv (9.5%).  Everything I expected."
"O: No date code anywhere on the bottle. I suspect this one might be over the hill. Hop character is flat, malt sweetness is too dominant and the syrupy texture is a little off-putting. I'll have to re-visit this sometime."
""
"Unfortunately disappointed with this offering.  It's really just a booze cruise of alcohol.  Looks good in the  glass, but us more like drinking beer shots than savoring hops and malts.  Go with Gemini from the Super Pack!"

"Cloudy with light amber color. Very malty sweet in the front with a bitter hoppy finish. It's a bit earthy and the alcohol is apparent but not overwhelming. Overall it's good especially if you consider it's something a little different."

"I have had this beer on two occasions, about a month and a half apart.  Do yourself a favor and get a fresh bottle.  The malt takes over quickly.  I am rating the fresh bottle here.  The hops are excellent, and the beer full bodied.  I really enjoyed this beer."
"Just okay. I hate southern tiers' malt bomination of mostly everything hoppy that they make. This one's probably the worst amongst them. It's a little bitter and citrus does come through a bit, but with every sip you are overwhelmed completely by the weird sticky sweet malty taste.  Not a good thing. Maybe this f bottle is a bit old at around 4 months, but I've had it fresh and hardly have noticed a difference. Definitely  stick with Gemini or 2x one for a hop forward beer and not a sweet malt bomb like this."

"Pours a deep amber color with a fizzy white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of hops with floral and citrus flavors coming through such as lemon zest and grapefruit. The taste was great with hops being center stage with the sweetness from the alcohol burn coming through on the finish. A wonderfully filling DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall on the sweeter side for a DIPA but is still very drinkable and worth getting"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A very nice DIPA, a slightly sweeter offering when compared to their 2XIPA.  Drinks very easy and is definitely worth seeking out."

"I've been introduced to the Southern Tier craft right at where it is all brewed in Lakewood, NY.  Being a novice Beeradvocate, I will rate this beer at a 5 because it is the IPA that started it all for my new found palate!"
"too strong. a good IPA that is overpowered by its undrinkablity due to high ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Man, I was hoping to get into a great American double and this has disappointed.  Malt heavy, refined white sugar sweet and too much orange for me.  The only double here is the malt."
""
""
""
""
"It's probably one of the best beers, you can really taste the citrus and caramel malts. It's strong but not to bittery. I love bitterness but it's nice still"
"Aroma is malty with some grapefruit hoppiness. Taste is very good and complex, sweet and not overly happy.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and creamy. Clean bitter aftertaste that isn't dry at all. Alcohol is well hidden on this smooth drinker. Overall this is a great warm weather beer, an ipa that won't dry you out! Very similar to 90 minute ipa, I need a side by side."

"Pours a shade darker than the typical DIPA amber with a smallish head of fine foam.  The smell of the beer was earthy, a little citric, and milder than I was hoping.  The taste was more hop-centric than the smell, as the citric flavors seemed to kick into overdrive at the start of the sip.  The beer stayed citric mid palette, and allowed a touch of watermelon to slip in towards the end of the sip.  The finish was surprisingly a little sweet, and the aftertaste was herbal.  This was quite complex for the style.  The body was medium dense and the feel sticky.  A balanced DIPA."
""
""
"really big beer, sweet but not too sweet. hint of spice.  caramel malt.  a little bit of candied tropical fruits.  overall a nice sipping beer, should probably be in a sweet mood for this one, although it is quite well balanced"

"Poured undated 12 oz bottle into pint glass. This is excellent beer. It brings to mind """Pliney the Elder""". The flavor profile is very similar. Pours a clear golden-yellow with a tinge of orange, with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Not a huge aroma, but its clean, floral and slightly dank, with some pineapple and peach. The taste is wonderful and just gets better the more you drink it. It's somewhat fruity and buttery with a perfect balance of sweet maltiness and huge hops but low bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with low carbonation, but still refreshing with well concealed alchohol. Overall, I'd say this is world class...a really great Imperial IPA."

"22oz bottled poured into IPA glass and nice frothy head reduced down to a slight top layer offering up some minimal lacing as well. Pine and caramel are abundant in the aroma. Flavor is of pepper, some pine and the caramel malt sweetness is really working here for me. Very smooth to drink with just a moderate bite on the palate. Dated 5/01/14 and enjoyed 6/22/14. May not be fresh for and IPA but this was fantastic! In closing, never had seen or heard of this brew but always not really sure what to think of Southern Tier beers. Either I love them or they are just okay, for me alone. Unearthly is quite awesome. Glad I picked this one up; which I did just because it was an Imperial IPA and it did not disappoint!"

"Poured into a standard pint glass, this is a pleasant amber colored beer with a modest head. The aroma offers a nice candied grass scent. Flavor is really nicely balanced between sweet, sticky malt and grassy, resinous bitterness. Yeast flavor is fairly neutral."

"An ok beer overall, but honestly, pretty mediocre for an Imperial IPA. Not bad, but disappointing and a bit of false advertising."
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess I'd say I'm a little disappointed, only b/c I was looking forward to trying this one. The alcohol comes through too much."

""
"Damn! This is Fuckin-A great beer!"
""
""
"Taste is leaning on the caramel malt side of things over the earthy piney hops, if the flavors were bigger, specially the malt backing, I'd almost say this could have been an aged American Barleywine, carbonation is quite active but balances between crisp and soft, body has a bit of a resiny aspect, the alcohol content is hidden pretty well."

"O- Overall a decent brew. A little too sweet for a imperial IPA in my humble opinion. But its got class. I prefer 2x IPA to this beer but this is good in its own right. Purdy damn good."

"I loved the oaked version of this ale so I thought I'd try its originator. This one pours a beautiful hazy copper color with a thick off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is malty with a slight hoppy bitterness. This bottle was born more than a year ago so the hop notes have subsided and left a rich malty beer almost reminiscent of a scotch ale more than an ipa. The flavor further confirms this opinion. Id love to try a fresh bottle of this ale because even an older one is impressive."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/17/2014. Pours crystal clear bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grass earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt flavors; and a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA! All around great complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"91 overall...? Eh. I think it's the malts used, but there's a flavor that I'm not huge on. A very nice, easy drinking beer that I'd surely have again, but it's not a GREAT brew. Alcohol is hidden flawlessly though, and it's quite drinkable. Nice one, but far from Southern Tier's finest."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"
"O - If you are looking for a hop bomb, this is it. A well executed, tasty drink that makes the super hop experience a treat. I'd happily pick one of these up again."

"Overall: Tasty, but a bit too sweet for my liking. It's like hops for people who don't like bitter. Beers like this make me with I could get nutritional information, I feel like I'm eating sugar cubes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, I am glad I tried this, its always fun to experiment, but this is one I will not be asking for again."

"Excellent example of the style, but I prefer the 2xIPA. This DIPA is lighter- and a beer geek may prefer this approach to the style on occasion."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Don’t really notice that it’s any better; not a drain pour, still just eh to ok."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a thick but thin foam that dissipates quite rapidly. Great smell of orange even though somewhat on the sweet side. Tastes very sweet for an IPA or at least for my liking. Lots of caramel, some citrus. Very thick on the palate, reminds me of some brown Belgians. Interesting and certainly different, but not what I am looking for in an IPA. Some say it's well balanced, I understand that it has a very high IBU and ABV but to me, the sweetness is a bit overwhelming."

"O: This is so close to being a great DIPA, so close. The malt is handled well, the bitterness is nicely restrained, and the hops have a nice flavor to them. But at the end of the day, it's just too sweet. 22 oz is way too much for this one. I'll absolutely drink this again, and hopefully, I'll have someone to split it with."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle, pours clear copper color with a little head which disappears quickly. Floral aromatic hops on nose. Alcohol is more loud and overwhelms the taste. But after taste is spicy and typical of imperial IPA. Only flaw I find in this beer is its a little dry and probably that's why alcohol overpowers."
"O: Yes, this is the refined little sister to ST 2X IPA...this brew is the girl you bring home to meet the parents, whereby ST 2X IPA is the girl you hang out with, party with and get platonically twerked by...then punched in the mouth by her the next day for letting her do that to you."
""
""
"Overall- Above average to good but mostly good. A very serviceable IIPA- there's nothing special about it but I would give it a try."
""
"So I may buy this again, but it's a tough sell when I can pick up a Ruination or the Green Flash Imperial IPA, or even better, that Green Flash Green Bullet (and I have no idea why people are knocking the Green Bullet. Massively underrated IMO!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Unique spice in this DIPA (more of a TIPA if you ask me) but not an outstanding brew overall. Not really my bag, baby."

"The Rest: Not a bad sipping beer, but a bit hot and rough. Stick with the 2XIPA, it has much better balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a delicious big flavored and well balanced IIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge head, hazy honey gold body, couple of rings left behind, aroma of sweet smelling hops. Very sweet and sticky in the flavor, biscuity, sweet pine in the finish, Bitterness is felt more in the aftertaste. Very nice stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a bad beer but definitely not my favorite imperial IPA. Nice balance with the malt but I need more hops on the nose to score his higher. I can't blame it on age, it's less that 2 months old"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lite amber/copper color with a big off white head. Hops, light citrus, sweet malts on the nose. I love the sweet beers and this one hits the spot with malt sugary sweetened to balance the wonderful hops. The 9.5% ABV is there but not overpowering but is warming as it goes down. I really like this beer."
"O-great way to start the saturday football day out. Bought a 12 pack of Southern Tier varity looking foward to to next one"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"A beastly DIPA, but I prefer 2XIPA from Southern Tier. To each their own, I suppose."
"O: This is a quintessential American DIPA; you can tell that the hop and malt bills were tweaked by true craftsmen to create a bold, balanced experience. I’ll admit that it’s a little too sweet for me to finish an entire bottle on my own, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s quite tasty overall."
"It's a decent DIPA. Pretty heavy on the maltiness. Nothing to go out of your way for."

""

"this beer is f'ing gross. it tastes like licorice or something. just a little to unearthly for this dirt dweller. sorta just weird flavors all around. maybe I got a bad growler? oh well, try it once if you're curious it's affordable and fairly easy to find. about try their double IPA, hope it's better."
""

"This is a good beer, but a mediocre DIPA. 2XIPA was far more to my liking. No bottle date (typical of Southern Tier; come on, guys!), so I don't know if this was an older bottle or what. I'd have to think their profile is normally more hop-forward."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent DIPA from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good readily available DIPA."
""
"O - I found this beer to be a bit unbalanced, favoring the malts. I have no way of knowing the age of the keg, so I don't know if this is due to age. Tastes more like a Barleywine than a DIPA. With that being said, it is still a pretty nice beer. A complex malt profile with a little bit of herbal hop bitterness on the back end make for an enjoyable brew. I may need to grab a reasonably fresh bottle to see if my assessment is a fair one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge West Coast IPA fan. Being from San Diego, I've always preferred the more piney IPAs. I've heard a lot of good things about Unearthly, so when I saw it at Wegmans in Syracuse, NY I decided to give it a try. Looks like your standard IPA. Golden copper. Smells very boozy and sweet. No sense of hops in there at all. Taste is really sweet and boozy as well. Hops play such a small role in this beer. I'm wondering if I got an old bottle or something. Mouthfeel is a little syrupy, but overall not bad. This beer is just way too sweet and malty for me. It doesn't even really taste like an IPA. Probably won't drink this again."
""
""
""
"O: Awesome beer. I still much prefer their 2XIPA, this is still a great beverage when you want more hops focus."
""
""
""
""
"Wow.... this bastard is hot.... and hot.... god damn... but I absolutely love it... nothing for me that's """undrinkable""" but enough to call it a sipper. This was now round 5 and I'm sure this beer put me over the edge... for me personally stone was cleaner and a hell of a lot smoother... but they were both malty but unearthly was a nice big malt bomb so to speak.. good hop profile in both but this came down to a split decision for me and the maltyness and that super hot burn left me with unearthly being the victor. I'm gonna buy another and sit on this bad boy a while...."

"Big. This is a slow sipper. The alcohol is pronounced. Like most imperials, at least to me, it's harder to pick out the particulars in the smell and taste. The overall drink is excellent though. I would certainly get this again."

""
""
""
""
""

"O: I was mislead by the label. When I see """unearthly IPA""" I expect nothing but hops. I like it nonetheless. The alcohol and malt are very balanced but needs more hops, both bittering and aromatic."
""

"IPA Day 2013 beer for me. Bottle date of 5/20/13 and enjoyed on 8/1/13. Pours from the bottle copper, clear, and with a big fluffy aromatic head. Aroma of big grapefruit and some sweet malts, then more grapefruit. Flavor has a huge malt backbone but with plenty of bitter from the hops. Very sweet and very much on style. Slick mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Pretty solid and much better than the Oakes version. Wondering if the hops had more power when this was bottled 2.5 months ago, but overall plenty of bite still there."
""
""
"Mmmmhmm. Those Easterners do their own thing, and I think Unearhtly gave me a real nice taste of that thing."
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell is a real mix of hops, yeast and malt, not quite what I'd expect from a DIPA. The taste is also more balanced that one might expect. It's nice, but just too boozy for me. Mouthfeel was great. Overall, a nice beer if you like your DIPA's really strong and not all that hoppy...almost more of a strong ale. If you're checking out Southern Tier and like IPA's I'd stick with the 2x or the regular IPA."

"Another great beer from this brewery. It's an amber colored, transparent liquid. An off-white head sits on top, long lived and lace-producing. Resin and pepper hop aroma. Some herb and sweet malt in the scent. The real pleasure is int the taste...sweet, a hint of toast, honey-topped bread, and flowery, mildly bitter hops. Lots of alcohol warmth, and a 'big-beer' feel. Thick, sweet, bitter in the finish. A bitterness that keeps coming in the aftertaste...wave on wave. Full, thick, and luxurious in body. Full-on high abv IPA."

"this is everything one could hope for in an east coast imperial ipa. it pours a decadent orange brassy color, dense and bright, with a luscious head, just off white, about an inch tall. the nose on this is intensely hoppy, oily heavy, and delicious. it reminds me somewhat of the founders centennial ipa, in the sense that its got that almost lumber quality to it, woody and sturdy, earthy and bitter, very nice aromatics here. I cant place the hops variety exactly, but its familiar to me for sure. big bitter hops all the way through the flavor of this one, with that fresh milled lumber element coming in and out. I get some sort of English malt underlying it all, and maybe even some English style bitter hops, but I also get bold American fruity and piney hops, sappy and fresh, penetrating my palate. the hopback process has been an obvious success here. good carbonation, fuller body, almost chewy in that classic way my mother describes big beers she cant comprehend. satisfying after a few days of not drinking, and a beer I am already dying to score again. one of the best from southern tier for sure."

"Unearthly pours a copper orange with a dense head of sticky foam that recedes unwillingly, fighting all the way and clinging to the glass. It doesn’t assault the nose like some IPA’s but boasts it’s hops behind the strength of it’s malt. Slick pine, oak and moss. On the palate the malt stays steady and sweet while the hops come up to a tart flourish. The body is heavy and slightly thick, mouthfeel is creamy but a little syrupy. An expressive IPA that lingers bitter and amenable."

"Golden amber in color with a bubbly pillowy white head. The nose is unique and complex. You get the pungent, fruity hops and the barrel. The barrel really comes out in the flavor. You really get the oaky, woody, buttery aspects of the barrel. Smooth and sweet. The qualities of an Imperial IPA really shine and the barrel adds nice complexities. Doesn't overpower or overshadow the base beer."
"It's so darn drinkable because of the decent malt bill along with the clean flavors."
"O - Very good IPA. High ABV not noticeable. Paired nicely with graham cracker ice cream."
""
"OVERALL: A really good brew in its own right, unearthly also has an oak aged counterpart. This version drinks much easier and has cleaner flavors. A great, readily available American Double IPA."

"overall: A maltier, less hoppsy version of an Imperial IPA. Make no mistake this thing is loaded with hops, but is not a hop bomb on the level of Ruination, Palate Wrecker, or Hopslam, etc.. With that said, it's very drinkable and the malt level is well matched to the hoppiness, very smooth and refreshing."

"Overall a great offering and a 22 was just right."

"M: creamy, full, nice oak qualities"
"Poured into snifter. Clear dark red-orange, a beautiful color. Moderate fizzy off-white head that sticks for a bit. Smells of flowers and citrus, absolutely delicious. Taste is smooth, blossoming into citrusy hoppy bitterness, and just before you think it's done, it smooths back out into sweetness. Very drinkable, alcohol only noticeable in the beginning. Mouthfeel is full, but clean. Excellent!"

"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours clear, dark copper with a finger length white head. The initial pour yields lots of tiny bubbles in the glass. Lots of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There is some maltiness in the aroma that is sweet and bready. I get some floral hop notes along with some grassiness maybe a bit of mild fruit. This is a very malt forward IPA without a lot of hop bitterness on the back end. There is some bitterness present. I get some fruitiness that reminds me of peach as well. The body is full and moderately carbonated. The finish is slightly dry. This is a good beer."

"O-too sweet for my taste and not enough hop character, like this less than the Oaked"
""
""
"O - Extremely dissapointed. I am a big fan of Southern Tier's IPA and 2XIPA. This is one of the most unpleasant beers I have ever drank. The extreme sweetness hides the ABV, at least."
""
""
""
""
"o - reminds me of oskar blues gubna and i'm not a huge fan of that beer either. worth trying but doesn't stand up to my favorite DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sold on this one. The hop profile is extremely weak. It feels as if they brewed a double batch worth of malt with a single batch worth of hops to make this beer. Not at all what I would expect from an IIPA."
""
""
"A great DIPA that straddles the hoppy barleywine/malty DIPA line. I don't usually like beers that do that, but this one works because the alcohol usually noticeable in those line-straddling beers aren't present."

"Definitely a well brewed DIPA and I wish I hadn't """cellared""" it by mistake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear red amber with hardly any head. The nose is really sweet and malty with some fruit and hop notes. Smell isn't super impressive. There is more bitterness in the taste, but the sweetness overwhelms a bit. The bitterness just pops up in the finish. Notes of pine and mild citrus peel. The carbonation is sharp and tingly. Flavors could blend better."

"O- Overall this is a very good beer.It was nothing like I expected it to be, which is not a bad thing. I enjoy interesting brews and this is surely one of them. I would recommend trying this, although when it comes down to it I would probably take Southern Tier's 2XIPA over this."

"I poured this bad boy in to a fluted pint and discovered some serious olfactory joy. The beer smells like fresh hops and sweet malt, with the latter coming through almost moreso upon consumption. Unearthly poured almost deep copper...practically redish but still retaining some shiny hues. The head was perfect...a solid one-inch of lacy goodness. The beer is balanced, complete, sweet and bitter...one of the best IPAs have tried 'new' in a long time. If you happen upon one of these, definitely pick it up. I can only imagine how good the oak-aged Unearthly is..."

"D- overall, southern tier is my new favorite American brewery, at least for its imperial series. I'm embarrassed at how many times I've passed them by. Unearthly, mokah, java, creme brulee, and pumking all deserve a plot of land on the moon. Or mars, whichever we get to first. The play of sweet on bitter here astounds me. Like I don't know whether to 5 it or not. BUT-- if there's question, it must not be the one. Damn close though."
""
""
"Southern Tier has earned quite a reputation for making some really sugary beers. Personally, I think this works for some of their stouts. But I was dreading Unearthly. To my surprise, this is more pleasant that I remembered. Yes, it's overly sweet, but it's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great imperial IPA, and I hope to see it on tap somewhere soon."
""
"O- A really nice IIPA, alot of balanced flavor with a sharp hoppy bite to it, I recomenend any IPA fan to try this one"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was a great beer my first barrel aged ipa although ipa's are meant to be fresh the barrel aging and the dry hopping that would have to go along with it adds a great complexity which makes this an outstanding beer"
""
""
""
""
"This pours a lovely amber with amazing clarity, would be a 5 for appearance but it does no have a huge head or any real lacing to speak of. Smells sweet and faintly hoppy, tastes really malty upfront then Followed by hops. Could use a little more carbonation but this is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer starts well and has some amazing hop presence but maybe a bit too much bitterness with too much sweetness leaves a less pleasant flavor lingering."
"M: Heavy body, coating mouthfeel. Little carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is not my style DIPA. I prefer ones with a more balanced hop profile. Maybe I also just don't like all these extremely herbal/floral hops in such a great amount. Either way, I will pass on this going forward."
""
""
""
""
"This is a sweet tooth DIPA. The thicker mouthfeel doesn't help for said sweetness but it's never to the point of cloying. It doesn't always have to be mouth numbing bitter every time and this fits the other side of the spectrum. The hops are there but they can't fight the heavy handed sweetness. That being said it works for the """BarleyWine meets DIPA Cleche""". Their regular IPA on tap was my favorite beer from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"I would of liked to have seen more hops but it's possible this is stale and out of date."
""
""
"Quite tasty. Hazy copper coloration. Smells of brandy and caramel. Taste is complex with some oak-like notes with a boozy finish (which I don't mind at 11%). Has enough hops for me, but I could see hop-heads being slightly underwhelmed. Overall, a tasty, unique take on IIPAs."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love most of Southern Tier’s beers, but this is not my cup of tea. The best DIPAs showcase hops, complement with malt and sneak in some alcohol. This is mostly malt and alcohol. I’m glad I waited until this was available in 12oz bottles because 22oz of this would be way more than I would want in an evening. Just too cloying, alcoholic and ...I don’t know...just not for me."

"Unearthly pours a hazy copper color, with a nice white head. Their is a strong floral aroma, with hints of sweetness. The taste contains a strong floral/hoppy flavor, with a strong bitterness. A good strong flavor, very bitter, but not as dry as it should be. Overall a very nice IPA, I found it a little different with a lack of a dry finish, and hints of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big, full flavored, full-bodied brew with a medium effervescence. If I hadn't know before, I would have no idea this was any variation of an IPA. I'm not an IPA guy but this is a massively good beer, not a west coast-style hop monster, a truly well rounded and delicious, multi-note concoction. This went absolutely brilliantly with a spicy red curry. It is so good it would be just as good all by itself. Get this and you will be so happy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall always been a favorite of mine. I think the 12oz bottle is more appropriate as this is a doozey to drink more of."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.61, a B. Southern Tier's Unearthly is a good sipper, on the hefty side, but overall a brew that I found to be enjoyable in small doses. Finishing this entire bottle is doable, but I'll probably have had more than my fill by the time the last drop is poured. I'd like to try a sample of this that I know is fresh, but there's no guarantee I'll get around to it. Pricy stuff, but probably worth it given the difficulty of finding decent DIPAs and barleywines in Ontario."
""
"O - The dense profile feels heavy and a shade syrupy, and cuts down on the drinkability. Nice backend."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its a much more malty IPA than a hoppy IPA which is what I prefer. The Mouthfeel was way too thick but the malty/ caramel sweetness was just what I like in my IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation was a bit screwed up, but oh well. Smell is sticky and honey sweet (exactly what I expect after having the oak-aged). The smell also holds a bit of spicy hops as well. The taste like has a very odd hop flavor. Its like a spicy, herbal, almost peppery feeling. The only other place Ive seen it is a local brewery (Carolina Brewery Firecracker Pale). The malt is much mroe subdued than I expected (in a very good way)."
""
""
"Had this on tap at Bulldog in Yurakucho, Tokyo. Poured into a tulip glass. Cloudy bronze brew with a thick crepe-looking head. Amazing rich bitter hops with a sweetness of miso paste and sweet caramel malts. Aroma matches following the hop side more closely. The lacing slides down the glass and glitters like a fireworks shower explosion. Sweetness of miso and caramel peanuts remains in the aftertaste with a bit of excess gas. Overall, an amazing strong IPA with its 125 IBUs that will lead me to more Southern Tiers. Easily one of my favorite IPAs ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good IPA. It has a pleasanlty strong earthy hops flavor, which is different from the aroma. It is a good beer, but I might not go too far out of my way to find it again. But, glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O - a fantastic yankee DIPA with an interesting and complementary hop flavour mix, big ups to andrenaline for including another great Southern Tier brew in this trade"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a good DIPA. Good marks all around, but nothing really stands out for me. It could just be that I’m not crazy about the particular hop profile, but this beer seems to be a bit lacking in that department, especially for something that touts “aggressive” and “unearthly” hop usage. Still, this is very tasty, the hop (and rye?) spice is a nice touch, and the alcohol is hidden very well. A final point: there are some breweries that have a certain “taste” no matter what style you’re drinking. Sierra Nevada is one example. Southern Tier is another. I’ve had a couple of their beers (only reviewed one), and they all have something about them that resonates through all of their offerings. I enjoy when beers from the same brewery have this quality and see it as a nice signature touch."
""
"O- This isn't the textbook DIPA, with a fairly weak hop profile, but it's a good beer. I almost think of this as a barleywine: it's sweet and bold and heavy with a very subtle bitterness on the finish. As an example of the style, I don't think I could recommend this, but for a big, bold, sweet beer that gets you hammered, it's worth the bomber (or growler if you can find it)."
"Since the first time I tried Unearthly in a bottle, I've wanted to try it fresh on tap. Here it is, straight from the source! A well balanced and delicious imperial IPA. Well worth a try. "
""
""
""
"O – Incredibly tasty, loaded with flavour. These guys nailed it, what a super DIPA. I will grab another bottle or two to enjoy before they’re all gone!"
""
""

"More than a little hot with alcohol, but the liqueur-like flavors go right along with the ABV. From the 22 oz bottle."
""

""
""
"On tap. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jan´12. Light copper color, crystal clear appearance. Yellowish white froth. Copious crown & collars. Caramel malt & resins to the nose. Gentle hoppy upfront. Gentle?, no way. Sharp oily resins explode all over. Flavorful & refreshing. Big beer, nice spot of the Imperial IPA style. Typical smartiness of Southern Tier products."
""
""
"Hopbomb with great aroma. Can see this being a bit much for some, and a little one-dimensional, but definitely satisfies a hop craving. I would seek this out again, and imagine a even more prominent aroma with a slightly fresher bottle."
""
"Not terrible... but I cant say I enjoyed it myself. Be prepared for the heavy maltiness and lack of carbonation. And definitely dont expect a powerful hop bitterness just because of the hop themed design on the bottle."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, with the born on date rubbed off, into a pint glass. Appearance is hazy dark orange/amber. Smell is mostly biscuity malts, bready. Taste is even, sweet at first with a little bite bitterness at the end. Some alcohol in the aftertaste. The malt flavor and sweetness from the alcohol are more predominant here then in West Coast Imperials. IMO, not a bad beer but at $9.99 for a 22oz I prefer something a bit more hoppy."
""
"**As this beer warms it tilts heavy into the citrus realm."

"O-great balance of flavors with a ton going on. Really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again"
"O - Solid beer, but nothing too remarkable. Personally, I prefer their 2x IPA to the Unearthly. I think that's more personal preference towards more hop-forward DIPAs."
"The alcohol melded nicely with the rest of this beer but make no mistake - it's there and shouldn't be ignored! This was a beer that wasn't brewed for the faint of heart in mind but those who love Southern Tier's offerings and something earthy, heavy, and complex will not be disappointed here. There's enough in this bottle to keep on occupied for a full night."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is malty, somewhat hoppy and just heavy. It's not bad but doesn't appeal much to me. Taste is similar... very sweet and quite bitter. Thick, cloying, boozy. It's big, not meant in a good way."
""
""
"O - the rumored 150 IBUs don't give the bitterness I had anticipated. Alcohol is pronounced but not overpowering. A pleasant warmth grows from the bitterness. Virtually no bite. A good beer but not an example of the style I would seek out ahead of the rest of the pack. Middle of the road, maybe up middle-class."
""
""
"This brew is pretty two-dimensional. Big grapefruit hops in the nose and to taste. A lot of sweeteness up front from the malts and then bitter/dry grapefruit finish. Hits you twice without being subtle anywhere in between. Noticeable alcohol and almost a bit too sweet. Okay, but lacks subtlety."
"Love it. Like usual."
""
"Overall I liked this, but didn't love it."
""
""
""
"A industry standard for a DIPA, solid beer but not in the upper class, a little boozy but I liked it and would seek it out again. thanks again liamt07 for knocking another want off my list"
""
"Overall this is a really good DIPA. Easy to find around here, and always very welcome in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I find this DIPA to be a good example of the style and to be quite approachable with a not too aggressive hoppiness. There is a nice balance in the flavor. This beer is pretty easy to drink and quite enjoyable, might be a little strong to be sessionable but certainly one I would enjoy again."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Got to try this last night-- a rarity out here in Colorado. Reminded me of Oskar Blues' Gubna. A hazy cloud of orange. Dank, hoppy aroma, which translates to one hell of a taste. Piney, complex hop profile. Starts off semi-bitter but goes down smooth and a hint of sweetness on the finish. Resinous and semi-sticky feeling in the mouth. Highly recommended."
""
"This is a golden amber in low light. The nose has a golden ruby red kiss of grapefruit. There’s sweet citrus aromas as well as some hints of cherries around the edges. Not hoppy so much as fruity—very pronounced fresh fruit flavors come across more than any citrus or pine hops (although there is a little piney chew to give it another layer). I get the cherries, as well as some berry notes, and it has a sweet finish. For an imperial IPA it was a complete surprise. Dessert-PA, anyone?"
""
"Overall: Malt and fermentation characteristics play in the background and allow the hop characteristics to shine. Enjoyable and a very good example of the style, but not a world class example."
""
""
""
"The beer a clear amber with almost no head. Strong notes of sugar and a slight hoppiness. I would have preferred more aromatics in it's nose, but it's not bad to have a balanced IPA for once. The taste is a modest bitterness with intense sweetness and potent alcohol. There is little aftertaste aside from a sweet lingering alcohol bite. Overall, great beer for a great price and excellent availability."
""
""
"O: This is a really nice example of the complex, dryer style of double IPA's. It's not the aroma hopped, citrus, tropical fruit west coast style, but an equally complex and tasty offering. I'd go out of my way to drink it again."
""
""
"Overall - excellent beer by Southern Tier of course, not unreal but I would give this a couple more shots."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a great beer for those of us who love Imperial IPA's and a great beer for those looking to get into I IPA's as it is incredibly well balanced and not overpowering."
""
"This has been one of the better beers from NY and from Southern Tier. Most of the time I go with their stouts, but I've been pretty happy with un-earthly. Would drink again when accessible (which is pretty much always -- I live in DC)."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a good DIPA from southern tier. On the other hand, it seemed a bit plain compared to many of the double IPAs out there. It was no doubt good, but it shines more through the balance than through the intensity or ability to stand out."
""
"overall this is a disappointment because it's obviously old or bad in some way. i'll try to get another review done with a fresher bottle."
"D - A very nice offering from Southern Tier... Much better than average, but not quite at head of the class for the style... Good hop complexity and excellent mouthfeel are the stars..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent example of the style, I hope to see it in my area again. Very smooth and drinkable, but also assertive. Great effort from Southern Tier."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good solid flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
"Best from Southern Tier for me so far, a complex brew that can be sipped for an hour"
""
"It looks nearly perfect. The head lasts a long time and leaves a lovely lace. It is clear and the perfect IPA color."
"O - A really good DIPA but at $9/bomber, I don't know how frequently I will seek this out."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass from a 22oz bottle. It has a nice bright orange color body with very little head that layed down to a nice thin lace. The smell is of citrus and floral hops. The taste has a nice hop flavor that pops when it hits your taste buds. It has a nice bitter finish to it. The mouth feel is great and overall a darn good ipa."
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a good balance between the flavors of malts and hops and hides its alcohol very well from the taste. All in all, it’s a solid double IPA."
""
""
"Overall; I really, truly enjoy this beer... I wish it was more readily available (I'd like to thank MicroFanatic for these!!) and I could definitely drink this a couple times a week and not get tired of it."
""
""
""
"O- I like it, not overly bitter but a nice hop flavor. Not nearly as much aroma or hop flavor as I would have expected from an iipa. Way too expensive for a single 22oz bottle of beer, even though I like it there are plenty of iipas that are much cheaper that are just as good, worth a try but I probably won't get it again because of the price."
""
"Overall - Definitely a great beer that has some of the qualities found in the west coast DIPA's. While it's not as sweet as some of the other Southern Tier beers, it's still pretty sugary and I don't think I could drink any more than 650ml. It also packs quite the punch at nearly 10% alcohol. While it is a very good beer, the bottle size and price will prevent me from stocking up."
""
"Copper/amber colour, one finger of white head, some lace left. Smell is hoppy, loaded with citrus, pineapple and mango, pine as well, malt is tucked away but still present, certainly smells like a hop bomb. Taste has a little more malt than the nose would tell you, lots of hops, quite bitter throughout, citrus, grapefruit, light sweetness, some pine, pineapple in the finish. Medium carbonation, med-full body, fairly oily, quite a nice feel for a DIPA. Quite satisfying and something that I could revisit again but for nearly $10 a bomber it wont be all that often."
"D - It is pretty good. As far as double IPAs go, it is just okay. It is never bad, but the taste is just wanting. In the future, I'll be sure the have the vastly superior 2X IPA from southern tier for a fraction of the price."
""
"O- This is a very good beer. Not over the top hoppy and easy to drink. This one will be on my drink again list."
"Interesting DIPA - I have to say I'm digging it, and I might pick up another bottle just to age. Packs a quiet wallop. As I'm finding, the maltiness of a DIPA such as this tends to overtake the hops that my tastebuds were expecting. So, if I'm in the mood for a DIPA or Barleywine, this brew would probably satisfy both urges sufficiently. Price tag is typical for ST in Ontario."
""
"Overall, a good double IPA - not a hop bomb, just a well balanced DIPA with a malt backbone and hop bitterness on the sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Very delicious double IPA offering that is big on both malts and hops. Will be picking up more of this."
""
"O: I think this is a pretty old bottle from the amount of sediment and sugary malts coming through. Lots of English Strong Ale/Barleywine characters. Decent."
""
""
""
""
"Darker orange body that is perfectly clear, offwhite head of great density and lacing that's sticky and webbed as heck. Nose has some flesh citrus notes with a good dose of pine and resinous hop notes. Really sweet and sugary malt notes - perhaps 'over'-balanced in terms of malt character, a tad much for what I'd prefer in a DIPA, but not bad by any stretch. Taste has more flesh citrus, pine, honeydew melon and some sweet sugary cookie/biscuity malts with a lot of sweetness to it. Alcohol is meshed in with this. Full bodied for the style, and carbonation remains low and smooth; harder to finish as it warms due to the sweetness however. Filling and easily destructive of sobriety, but I don't think I enjoyed this much as I have previously. Perhaps bottle freshness was the culprit."
"Overall, really quite a nice DIPA. The malt component plays a nice role. Good stuff!"
""
""
"Great beer... Kinda pricey at nine bucks a bottle but I would buy it again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect American Double, bursting with hop aroma and flavor. Perfect carbonation helps this high alcohol beer go down smoothly. Wish I got more than 2 bottles when i stopped there! Taste is a perfecct balance of malt, hops, and booze. Love it and you should seek it out!"
"Very smooth and drinkable for an IIPA. Lots to enjoy here."
""
""
"O- I definitely dig this from Southern Tier. It's name definitely fits description, and will have this in the future. Definitely recommend."
""
"O- This isnt my favorite Southern Tier IPA offering but its certainly a good one. Ive seen this all over the place and am just now getting around to it. I may have again in the future."
""
"O- This is the way an iipa should be."
""
"Unearthly is a very good hop-heavy double IPA. I appreciate being able to pick this up in the New Jersey area. This is a high end IPA with a good price tag."
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: The beer is a pleasure to sip in that it is never overly bitter nor overly sweet. So “balanced” is a good word for this beer. It is definitely a well made Imperial IPA and one well worth having again. My overall impression is of a memorable beer that stands out as an excellent example of the style and as having few if any flaws."
""
""
"I was very pleased with this beer, particularly since I found the bottle for $4.99. It delivered a complex and flavorful IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I now see why I have subconsciously avoided this beer (I knew it was a sweet-sided DIPA). Not really a fan here. I think I enjoyed the Oak-Aged version better because it worked well with the beers sweet tendencies. I will take any DIPA that at least tries to be hop forward before I take this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
"While it is nice to drink this with dinner, it is better in a Dogfish Head snifter while relaxing on a warm night on the deck."
""
"Sweet caramel malts blend nicely with the hops. Creamy body. Refreshingly clean, yet still retains its hoppy sharpness. Very strong, slightly sweet malt backbone -- which is how I like my DIPAs -- that finishes equally sweet and bitter. Odd, yes, but I like this beer."
""
""
""
"Great DIPA for the price, though. Just have someone to share it with."
""
""
""
""
""
"Eggshell head with nice lacing. Color approaches a clear, rosy honey. The smell is invigorating; plenty hoppy but light, citrusy and sweet like some kind of beer flower. The taste delivers; filling, but not too heavy. Flavors contain the scents but add both sweetness and warming hop bitterness. My favorite IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try and I would surely recommend it."
"This is definitely a big DIPA, probably one of the biggest I've had. The problem for me is that, in addition to big hops, there is a big sweet characteristic to it as well. At times the sweetness is what dominates. It's definitely a good beer and can be a welcome change when looking for a hop fix with something else going on but it's not a top notch DIPA."

"hazy copper body, three fingers of thick creamy white head. excellent retention and lacing. smell is mainly bready malts and sugar, hops are hiding in the background. taste is really sweet and sugary. strong caramel malt presence. hops are in the background again. mouthfeel is medium body, decent carbonation, oily and a long bitter finish. there is no date or dust on the bottle and the guy at the store said they just got them in. however this is far from a top dipa in my opinion. i'll try this again in the future and hope it's better."

"Overall: this one is an interesting beer. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected and there is more of a molasses note than hops."

"The aromas are full of pungent grapefruit-driven hops. There's also a touch of sweetness in the nose, which is always a good sign to me. On the palate the Un*Earthly is full of rough and pungent bitter hops. But there is still a nice sweetness on the finish. It's like a not-so-sweet version of the 90 min IPA. The Southern Tier Un*Earthly is flavorful, bold and intense, yet drinkable and quite delicious!"
""
"Overall: A good beer but maybe just a little too sweet for me as a DIPA, was looking for more of a punch at the end with some bitterness but a very good drinkable beer. I will pick up this again to have on hand in the fridge. Would be good after a good meal."

""
"O: A fairly good IPA, but nothing to get too excited about. I would recommend this to someone that cannot handle really bitter beers, but the lack of hop bitterness in this brew let to a beer that boarded on sickly sweet IMHO. Fair, but not great."

"This is a nicely done DIPA, and ST is unashamed in leading with the big hop profile to make this stand out by kicking you in the face with their hop-prowess."

"I have seen some comments about its drinkability - ok - so most belgium beers are too strong to be """drinkable""". Your not going to sit back and knock off a sixer of these on a hot day - its just not that kind of beer. It is, however, a remarkable beer with few peers."

"Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Fairly one-dimensional and overall not great, but worth a try for the experience. I wouldn't get more than a sample simply because it is so dry and bitter...not very drinkable, and the style is not an excuse as I've had some very drinkable DIPA's."
""
"Poured a medium amber hue with a small off-white head. Smell of citrus zest and fresh hops. Taste starts out with a caramel coated biscuity-ness, but is soon overtaken by a good dose of fresh hops, lemon zest, and a bit of grapefruit essence, with a subtle minty quality. Decently balanced with neither aspect fully taking complete control for any extended bit of time. Medium mouthfeel, and quite drinkable, though nothing really above average."

"O - A little bit too sweet for my liking, maybe this one finished a little high. Great balance, and hop flavor."
"O: Pretty good, but nothing out of this world. Not sure on how old the bottle is, since this one is pre-dating. Glad to see ST popping a date on their bottles now."
"Pours a clear but hazy orange/gold with a one and a half finger off white creamy head. The aroma isn't jumping out at me. I get some cereal graininess, sweet malts, and light citrus and maybe mango. The taste is along the same lines as the smell, just more intense. Sweet malts hit you up front, the bitterness comes through in the middle and end, but the malty sweetness keeps it balanced the entire time. Mouthfeel is creamy. Overall, much better than the other Southern Tier IPA offerings. I would have liked to see more bitterness as this is a pretty sweet DIPA. My main complaint with Southern Tier IPAs is that they all seem to be too sweet. I love balanced IPAs,but this one is a little more malty than it is bitter. The 9.5% is definitely noticeable, but not unpleasant. Good DIPA and one that I would recommend to those who like sweeter DIPAs."
"Drink- I can see why this has a lot of ratings. The balance between thick and creamy and a little bitter is quite nice. A good DIPA that is a bit more smooth than most but still hides the ABV well. Thanks again Matt!"
"Hard poured into a fluted glass. Amber colored with a white head. Light lacing on the glass. Head dissipates quickly. Citrus and pine smell with a sweetness I cant really describe. Tastes hoppy up front then transistions into a slight alcohol taste that is well balanced. Ends with a nice sweetness. Very nice mouthfeel, carbonated great with the right bitterness. Overall I'm very happy with the this beer. i bought it on a whim and I'm glad I did. It's the first time I have seen this here and I hope I can keep finding it. The ABV on my bottle was 11% so its a little different from the description on here."
"It poured a foggy golden color with a modest head. Nice smell of hops. My first impression was that it was too sweet. When it hit my palette I thought """fruity""" which is normally not something I like. Someone described the taste as medicine-like which fits initially but by the time I finished my first glass I was anxious for more. To this beer's credit it may have been the ABV that changed my tune but my grandfather always says accentuate your best qualities."
"O: Wow. Definitely was expecting a sweeter version of 2XIPA or something, but instead got this. I like it. A lot. Especially at just over a month old. See what dating your bottles can do, ST? I'll definitely be buying more of this. And 2XIPA, while I'm at it. Back on track though, this is a great IIPA to sip on that is full of hoppy goodness without the usual sweetness of, say, the Black Water Series. Pick up a fresh bottle if you haven't yet! You won't regret it"
"Overall: another great S.T. brew if you like ST you will love this IPA."
"The taste is good, but a bit too sweet. That malty backbone counters what I can only assume to be an unforgiving rush of hops. With that kind of sweetness and the ABV of this beer, it's flavor is almost like a cross between a barleywine and an IPA. Like barleywines (which I don't particularly care for) it was a bit medicine-tasting to suit my palate. I did like this one a bit more than the oak-aged version. I probably won't buy it again, but don't let that stop you. It could be just what you're looking for."
"D: great show of balance here. however, i wouldnt hate a tad more showing from the hops here. mostly in the nose. im certainly being critical here, otherwise a tasty DIPA."
"Pours a murky honey orange-brown with a 1 inch fizzy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very much like a barleywine with malt, caramel, toffee, and lots of citrus zest hop aromas. Taste is also very much like a hoppy barleywine with malt, caramel/toffee, brown sugar, and some citrus zest on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a mild carbonation with a crisp yet smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that seems much more like a barleywine than a DIPA. I am pretty sure this was not intended but it's very good none the less."
"O - It's a good IIPA, but I just feel like it could be more balanced. The flavors meld really well but I could just see it being a little less sweeter with more hop characteristics and less boozy taste."
"O: Easy drinker, a nice kick back and relax beer. Becomes a bit boozy as it warms. Could enjoy this as an occasional change of pace beer."
"o- an excellent beer, highly recommended for lovers of this style."
"Overall - It's good, and I like the flavors, and I like sweetness in a DIPA, but this one just isn't balanced as well as it could be. It is possible this bottle is a bit past it's prime, so I will definitely try another one soon. I wanted to like this more."
"This must be passed its prime and old. Not sure when this was bottled but I think this is from too long ago. Will have to somehow find a fresh one for a re-review. At least its drinkable."
"O- A worthy IIPA. For 9.5 and the style, it drinks pretty easily. Definitely worth a try."
"This ranks among the best examples of an Imperial IPA - big, bold with (obviously) a boatload of hops and a sturdy malt platform on which to sally forth. Hops profile is both citric and called to mind Bell's Two Hearted Ale, with a touch of Founder's Centennial. ABV is well integrated in the profile, and the lively hopping keeps the flavor interesting throughout."
"O - Great beer, I could stand to have a few of these around regularly."
"Tried this and maybe I expected too much or too much hops but this was way sweeter then I expected and no hop bitterness... Good drinkable beer tasty sweet but not at all what I was expecting when I bought this... Love IPA's and bitterness was really hoping for something that punched me in the mouth bitter and just didn't happen"
"I thought this was a pretty good beer, very easy to drink. Maybe a little more sweet than I would like, but still something I would drink again."
"O: An excellent IPA. Very well balanced despite being very high in hops."
"Overall, a really good beer. Not in the proportions I prefer, but consistent with its style, so I can't complain. Also, it goes perfectly with kettle chips, so my taste buds are enjoying the party. Enjoy."
"O: I think the reason I dig the Oaked version of this brew is because the bitter, West Coast-esque elements stayed intact, while the sweetness was tamed. Still, this one was tasty."
"O: Well, I wish I knew the bottle date on this beer. I know it's not particularly new (as I've heard they've gone through a label change), but nonetheless, I know their beers to be generally sweet. As a result, I'm stuck believing this is relatively along the lines they intended. As an IIPA, this is far from hopped enough."
"o - honestly i was pretty blown away. it certainly is appropriately titled. this beer just vaulted into my top 3 favorites for the style (rounded out by dfh 90 and hopslam). worth seeking out."
"o-very good. not the best but a very good enjoyable IPA."
"D - Very nice, good blend of carmel sweetness and hoppiness."
"D - Very drinkable. For an 11% abv beer, this still feels nice and balanced and drinkable. Sure, it is a bit more of a hoppy strong ale than a DIPA, but it still works quite well overall."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is a solid tasty brew. Not sure of the age but given the aromatic hopping going on i would say it was reasonably fresh. Glad i tried, i recommend this to 2ipa fans!"
"Medium drinkability, as this is a once a year bomber for me that I will always seek out and savor alone. This is not a session beer, and not a beer that I’d split with someone, but it is a very tasty DIPA that I will come back to year after year because it always tastes so damn good and flavorful, and always is an experience to drink. This is a slow sipper that is meant to tingle your mind the same way it tingles your taste buds. This is pretty sweet for an IPA, but that sweetness helps to hide the alcohol and really allows this beer to slide down smooth. I highly recommend trying this beer,"
"I must say, I like this more than the oak aged rendition. Much smoother although, this STILL tastes oaky. Poured with a minimal head. Very sweet, malty taste. Lots of caramel. Finishes a bit sweet. Decent enough beer, but won't likely revisit. Give it a try."
"O - This is not a bad-tasting beer, but it is a poor representation of an imperial IPA IMO. The bitterness is very subtle for the style, and the hops are in way too good of balance with the malt. I don't drink an imperial IPA for perfect balance between malt and hops, I drink it for a pronounced hop character."
"Unfortunately this is a beer with two stories: it is amazing fresh, but definitely looses a lot with age. This review is about as fresh as you can get (on tap from the brewery). A review of this beer in a bottle is coming soon..."
"Overall, this is an outstanding DIPA. Nothing too harsh or grassy. Very nice balance."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and thick. Light carbonation and a sticky feel. This is a dessert Imperial IPA. A must try and a quality beer, but a little too thick and sweet to be top notch."
"O: A very good IPA though slightly sweet for my taste."
"Overall - Definitely not a bad DIPA by any means. Not quite my favorite iteration of the style, but still pretty good. I'd say it's worth a try especially if you like maltier/balanced DIPAs. I could see myself drinking this one again, especially when I'm not in the mood for a hop bomb of a DIPA. Can't wait to try Oak Aged Unearthly. Thanks again Tom!"
"I really liked this one. A little malty, but it helps balance the hops and alcohol. Really enjoyable!"
"O: A different blend of hops leaves me wondering about the taste of this one. Don't know if it is good or not. Definitely a deviation in the style. Probably a must try for most. Don't believe this one is for me though."
"Coming in at 11% this is something you need to sip to enjoy, no downing like the town drunk on this one."
"O- its a decent beer but its very sweet and malty for an iipa. I am not a very big fan of that."
"O: Overall, this is an alright beer. It seems a little off for an IIPA. Little too thick, too swett, and too rich. Not a memorable beer"
"The CPJ"
"Not an elite DIPA in my opinion... An OK brew for sure but a notch down..."
"O- Not great. I have been wanted to try this for a while. It's not a bad beer but the sweetness was just too much for me. Old bottle maybe?"
"Overall: Thanks to inlimbo77 for this beer. Although it isnt my favorite, I was glad to have tried it."
"Full bodied, below average carbonation, sticky mouthfeel, and the alcohol is well disguised. Good overall, but too sweet."
"O- Very solid DIPA. Could easily drink one of these again sometime, especially on a nice summer day. A little sweet to be one of my favorites, but very good!"
"Hard drink, great flavors, but challenging to drink."
"A lovely Imperial IPA. It makes everything bigger, but doesn't forget the balance and subtlety that is required as well. Great work."
"O-Very Enjoyable. Not a true hop bomb yet very ballanced. I would drink again but not go out of my way to seek it out."
"The mouthfeel is very syrupy. Extremely thick and has a very full body. There is some carbonation bite on the tongue, but the thickness is too much for me.. Overall, it's a decent DIPA, but I've had much better. Another good offering from Southern Tier, but not something I'd seek out again."
"Settles amber, with a creamy thick head. Smell is not as aromatic as I hoped, but it is pungent. Lots of malt/honey/faint hops. Tastes similar to its smell, not much going on as far as hops, loads of malt and a decent alcohol burn. Overall, it was pleasant and I would drink it again if it were readily available."
"I've had this stuff in the fridge for 2 weeks and its a shame I didn't open it sooner. Its a magnificent beer, and dare I say it, competes with 90 Minute. Its unbelievable how deceptive this is, they should have named it """Really Hot Transvestite.""" Enough with the kid, go buy this stuff now, its unbelievable and really gets me thinking about the Brewery and its Oak Aged Unearthly. I gave the mouthfeel a 4.5 cause my first sip told me the malt was too much, don't let it do the same to you its very well balanced. Can't wait to get my hands on some of the highly anticipated Pumking. Enjoy this responsibly, and stay thirsty my friends!"
"O: Very nice beer. Not a booming IPA...but still different. Fruity, citrus, Malt, hops...good combo..not a drink a bunch of these beer..but one of the bombers split between friends is a great conversation piece...."
"overall, I love this beer. I am from the camp that likes there DIPA balanced and not a complete hop-bomb, and this fits the bill perfectly. One of the better DIPAs that I have found and for $9 a bomber, a pretty solid deal as well."
"D- 3.5 I'm slightly disappointed with this ST offering; the 2XIPA is great, and so I had my hopes up. That said, it isn't bad by any means. It's just not what I was looking for in the style being so sweet and malt heavy. That said, it is still a quality brew and worth a shot. I'd probably just want one of the bombers in a sitting."
"O - Awesome brew! Great job ST! A must try if you have access. Uh, oh... This one's going down QUICK! Thanks for flipping this brew my way AndyAvalance!"
" The flavor is good, but it seems to be bitter enough to shift toward the hops, but the malt presence in the taste gives the impression of balance -a nice fruity flavor from the hops, more citrus as it warms,but also more bitter and the taste of alcohol and spice comes forward too. There is a nice tropical element in this that seems outweighed by the caramel malt slightly which is unfortunate. I prefere a more dry Imperial IPA, but for this style I think this beer is very good. I consider it very drinkable considering the high 9.5% abv which is mostly hidden in the full malt and generous hop dosing in the flavor"
"O: Very nice refreshing and complex taste with a well hidden high alcohol content. Very happy that this is lacking the Southern Tier 'show off our alcohol content' standard that has turned me away from a few of their other selections."
"D - Drinks a bit sweet, and very vanilla forward."
"Had this a little while ago from a bottle and thought it was fantastic. Last summer I took a trip to the brewery and brought home a Growler of it. This beer pours out as a really great looking copper color with a creamy looking frothy head on it. The lacing is thick and sticky. The smell of this is of course hoppy, lots of pine and cirtus in the mix. The taste is very good for any IPA lover. The mouthfeel is sharp and tingley on the tongue. Truely a really good beer here. Looking forward to having this whenever I can."
"O: Really nice beer that as long as I can know it is fresh, I will be certain to be purchasing again. A really really nice representation of a DIPA."
"O: Overall I think this is a good imperial IPA. It's definately something I'd drink again and it does a superb job of hiding the alcohol. I don't think it's perfect though."
"O - Not a bad beer by any means, but I don't think I would purchase it again. I prefer my DIPA to have more hops and less syrupy sweetness. There are a lot better DIPA's out there."
"O- This beer has a lot of very nice strong flavors that balance out nicely and it looks great when poured too."
"Overall: A very good take on a DIPA."
"Overall it's pretty good, but less than spectacular. Still, a bomber of this is certainly more than a meal for most of your daily DIPA needs."
"O- Totally solid, although I think I like the oak aged unearthly a bit better. The sweetness was just a touch too much for me. Still, this is a totally solid beer that I'm sure I'll look for in the future."
"This beer took me by surprise. I was expecting an unearhtly amount of hops, and instead I got an unearthy amount of chewy, caramely malt. I think if I would have gotten a better description before drinking it I would have been able to enjoy it more. Despite all that, it was good and had an interesting flavor."
"Narrative: Daisy Michaels decided at age 15 that she had enough of the Deliverance church services that she had attended for years. Sure, for a child, people wretching and rolling in the aisles had a note of noble bitterness to it. However, after years and years of this behavior, the sad rancor in the room was just an overriding malaise. “ALL OF YOU CAEIUFH WREGHHHH BERRR!!!!” Daisy sighed as she held down a middle aged woman down with an outstretched blanket as she expelled her demons. “Wreghhhbleghhh-” to her right, the local librarian gagged and spit into a paper sack. Sure, it wasn’t the AVERAGE triumph of good over evil, but in the end it was still a type of grassy purity that came from a solid agrarian community."
"This beer has such a syrupy feel that it was hard to get past. I don't mind thickness at all, but when the flavors that stick around do not have any of the characteristics of good solid DIPA it makes it hard to take seriously. It just was not for me."
"Not bad overall, but just a bit too much alcohol heat and sweetness for me to really be into."
"Aroma is richly hoppy, almost evergreen, with a firm grapefruit undertone. It pours a nice orange amber with a fluffy and fairly persistent off-white head. Flavor is quite hoppy and slightly but pleasantly bitter, with a definite oak tone and more than a hint of grapefruit. Texture is rough and lively, leaving a nice tingle. Recommended to all """hop heads.""""
"One of my new favorites of the style. Carefully toes the line between """just enough""" and """too much"""."
"Overall, this is a well-crafted DIPA that hides its alcohol well and balances flavors nicely. However, it's a """middle road""" that has a lot of malt balance and not as much explosive hop flavor as one would expect."
"I think there is alot to be said about designing such a massive beer and maintaining the drinkability. And I can also really appreciate that I can taste the fresh water and ingredients used here. But in the end this one finishes on the sweet side and I would have liked to see a better marriage of the hops used. The spicy hop and sweet tofee malt flavors just kind of take over. Glad to have tried for sure though!"
"Pours a beautiful copper with an inch of off-white resiny head. Intense hop aromas..even more intense hop taste..floral, citrus, spicy, piney, bitter yet balanced with a substantial amount of sweet malt. You can definitely taste how strong this beer is. Hop resins seep from your pores after drinking one of these."
"OVERALL: If this beer tasted as good as it smelled and felt as good as it looked it would be one of the best in the world. It is still pretty good, but not what it could have been."
"O - This is very unusual for an Imperial IPA which is why I like it so much. Not your typical Imperial/D-IPA, nice job, Southern Tier. I've had this beer so many times before but never reviewed it. Even more astonishing, over 900 reviews and a picture was finally submitted! That's very unusual."
"O) Not bad, just doesn't taste like an IPA or double at that."
"o: i really don't know what to say about this one. it's really expensive, and all my friends that have had this beer have said such great things about it. and honestly it was a huge let down. i think the oaked version of unearthly is far far better, and even gemini is much better. but if you're going to buy any southern tier beer ipa, get the 2x IPA. i haven't tried their regular ipa, but i've had all the others and the 2x is WAY better than all these small batch bombers. this one was definitely the least hoppy, somehow the oaked version tastes that much different."
"*Note: I could not find a """born on""" date on the bottle, so it may not be the freshest of beers, as it tastes like some other Imperial IPAs I've had past their prime..."
"This one won't please hopheads, I know that. However, as a person who does enjoy malty DIPA's, I found this a very easy drinker although it was so sweet for style that it could get cloying. The ABV is really high, so that's something to watch out for."
"M- Medium to heavy body...very dry finish"
"Overall (3): A bit too sweet - borderline cloying - as well as bitter. They even each other out, but the hops aren't really showcased here; it's mostly an interplay between the bitterness and sweetness. I'd like to try this a bit fresher on tap."
"The mouthfeel is full and thick, and the drinkability is exceptional for the 9.5% ABV. I highly recommend this DIPA if you can get a bottle you know is at least relatively fresh, this is a great brew. Just a solid DIPA in every way."
"O: This is a good one. I feel like southern tier is a """sweet""" sort of brewery, with their stouts and even their DIPA being the maltiest and sweetest I've had yet. Still, this is a good one, definitely will buy again."
"Overall: Overall, a bit too sticky and sweet to be my ideal DIPA; a rather good example for those who prefer that style of beer, however"
"Many thanks to Finewinemike for the chance to taste this long time want. Poured into my Jester King snifter, pours a yellow/orange hue, very cloudy in appearance, with visible bubbles. Smell- blood orange, malty bready scent, alcohol on the nose, some fruit forward flavors. Taste- caramel sweet, mixed with hops bitterness mid palate, finished with a bitter grapefruit flavor. Lots of sweet flavors in this beer hide the alcohol well, and balance out the bitter profiles. Mouthfeel- syrupy and sweet but not cloying, appropriate carbonation, well balanced. This reminds me of DFH 90 minute in a way (maybe the malt profile?) Drinkability- for 11%, the abv is well hidden here and this is an overall well balanced representation of the IIPA style. I'd search it out again for sure."
"I drank this Imperial out of a beer glass and not saying i didn't enjoy it but definitely not one of my favorites. Hard not to enjoy an Imperial IPA."
"O: overall an excellent strong beer to enjoy when u r feeling bold. This isn't a beer to play around with"
"Recommended, just not a lot of it."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter- a very hazy looking dark amber beer with very little head and slight lacing. Aroma is of sugarcane and hops. Taste has that signature Southern Tier sweetness, but it is very tolerable in the form of this IPA. Hops is prevalent, and only slightly citrusy. Heavy bodied, and slightly yeasty. Overall a very good IPA and refreshingly not too sweet, as most Southern Tier tends to be. Good drinks here."
"Overall: At 10% ABV it's a quite drinkable beer. It's in the same league as HopSlam and 90min. IPA although I would prefer HopSlam if I had all three sitting in front of me and I could only drink one. I've had the 2XIPA also but prefer the taste of this. It just seems a little more complex and interesting."
"This is not as hoppy as I would expect. Lots of cigar & malt qualities. Has an ending that's liquor-like. The alcohol is actually hidden quite well up until the end."
"This is a savory, tasty beer, that went excellent with my """Indian hit""" saag lamb earlier. I'm happy to have a growler that, over the next few days, will make me appreciate how good a brewery Southern Tier is. If you're not lucky enough to find this on tap, at least treat yourself to a 22 oz bottle and enjoy!"
"D: A step above average but at 10 ABV it kept me from going the extra step to Good."
"Ending notes: What a great beer! A nice sipper. I would easily recommend this to any hop head. Very enjoyable."
"Overall- It is a palate wrecker, but it tastes pretty damn good. I would end your drinking session with this one, because you won't be tasting all that much after this one."
"D: This is pretty lackluster, I remember it being much better. Not at all crisp or hoppy like a DIPA should be. Not much different from any other mediocre DIPA. I'm guessing it's due to some combination of over-cooked batch and an old bottle."
"D: it is a boozy ipa, I like it, it's fresh and has alot of character."
"ooh baby, this ale is delicious! little fizz of alcohol dances smooth citrus hops and slight pepper esters across the tongue. Goes down with a creamy citrus after-taste and warming alcohol. Gotta slowdown with this one."
"Drinkabilty - High but be careful its 11%. Strong hop and malt heavy, a great balance for a double ipa. A real treat, not something to drink daily but once a month i tend to go un-earthy. World class."
"This is thick...so thick. Add in some alcohol burn and just a touch of carbonation. I have to admit it... I want to love this beer, but darn it. I just can't. It's good but it is just missing all over the place."
"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. with no apparent freshness date. Deep orange in color with a brief head. ,Poor head retention, but plent of wispy lacings. Intense ctirus and floral aroma. Extremely pleasant citrus hop and malt balanace with a very claean finish . Without being being terribly unusual this was an extraordinary 2ipa. thanks Southern Tier!"
"I would highly recommend this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to pick up a growler."
"I could bathe in this, but the fact is that the taste is just wonderful. I've heard so many adjectives tossed around over this one that I prefer to see one slide across the bar to you and wait for the adoration. I try not to get more than I can drink in one sitting with this bad boy. So like 6?"
"D/M: Very crisp and carbonated with some great strong flavors competing against each other. Good to have one but hard to drink anything else after this."
"Poured a beautiful golden, orange, reddish honey color. Wonderful head that after about 10 minutes has dissipated and left some nice lace. Nose is wild and clean honey. I keep smelling it over and over and that keeps coming thru. Taste has a good hoppy bite with vanilla. Great on the palate. After about 10 ounces or so, I have a nice warm belly feel and a slight buzz. At 11%, not sure how much of this I could drink, but given all of it's components, I wish it was ALOT...."
"Overall: This is a damned good DIPA! It doesn't really fall into any coast style, but rather stands alone as a unique brew. Really the epitome of """spicy hops""" and a unique and extremely tasty brew."
"Drinkability: Unfortunately, this beer is a bit too bitter for me. However, if you're a hophead, you might find this beer a lot more enjoyable."
"BTW-Oak Aged Un*Earthly is ever better!"
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew, it's drinkable, but it's not something I'd search out. I prefer DIPAs with crisper, sharper hops. This mixture of hops also produces a odd flavor that I'm just not a fan of."
"after a few gulps it starts warming your body..the heat is there...just a bit hidden...."
"Drinkability - is average... with 11% alcohol it is kind of impressive.. .but I think 1 (maybe) 2 is enough."
"D - Easy to drink for the alcohol content."
"D - more subdued and sweet than others of the style -- hops there, but not a palate-wrecker, very smooth, a """dessert IPA", if you will"
"I indulged in this beer at a local brewpub, on the beach on a hot summer afternoon. I was on vacation and had consumed several rum drinks by the ocean earlier in the day, so my girlfriend and I ventured into this bar during our wait before dinner. At the bar i drank 2 or 3 other high gravity brews before i rounded up enough courage to step up to the Unearthly... I drank the 22oz. bottle and needless to say me and my girlfriend missed our reservation. This beer offered a drunk unlike anything i had ever experienced, I literally felt like i was tripping on a drug from the 70s. When i woke i was nude in my hotel room, so needless to say i traveled back to this bar and purchased several more Unearthly bottles to go. I absolutely love this beer, no other Imperial IPA has topped my personal beer list."
"D - UnEarthly had a nice balance to it but I prefer my DIPAs with more hop presence...the tap provided a nice mouthfeel that was oily and creamy and coated the palate and left you wanting another sip...on the downside the 10% showed up a little too much"
"Can't say enough about this brew... great taste! Southern Tier really constructed this brew well. Can't believe it's 11% ABV with such a balanced taste. Alcohol is masked well. Would recommend highly! Mouthfeel was syrupy and refreshing. Finish is smooth... left me anticipating another sip!"
"Overall, I suspect the bottle I got may have been a bit too old. However, if they're not going to bother bottle dating their beer, I should not be bothered with continuing to buy it in hopes that I get a fresh one. Most 10+% DIPAs can stand a bit of age as well before falling off."
"D- a def sipper but a good brew."
"Overall: Not exactly my ideal DIPA, but this is still a very good beer. I'm not sure how fresh it is since there is no information on the bottle. This is a beer that I would recommend trying, especially if you know you're getting it fresh."
"Great with food, particularly pork roast with gravy. Would also pair nice with rich, stinky cheese. Could even see this with some spicy, Indian veggie fair. In sum, if you don't try this with some food, you might be missing out."
"Drinkability: This is a quaffable brew, right in my wheelhouse ABV and in terms of flavor. For some reason a ton of pine hops always puts a ceiling on how much I will like it, but I would definitely go back to this."
"M&D- For how light this beer is in color and transparency it gives a nice full texture. A nice warm feeling all the way through. I don't know how much the ABV changes from batch to batch by the bottle i have says 11% ABV. And its not the oak aged bottle."
"Overall: Not for the skiddish. This beer is huge. Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend Amy for the Christmas present."
"D: Like many of ST's beers, I found this one to be far too sweet for my palate to handle. Plus I felt it to be out-of-balance and oddly flavored, making this only a slightly better than average DIPA."
"one glass is enough for me in a session, dont plan on tasting any other beer after this. a really nice big DIPA that can compete with any big west coast DIPA. went well with a nice moldy blue cheese. ill definatly be back for more and highly recommended IMHO."
"The hops give a nice pine then citrus bitterness to off set the sweetness. Good mouthfeel and the alcohal is well hidden making this an easy drinker. Just not my favorite, I would prefer a Hop Trip by Deschutes."
"D- I'm more of a dark beer guy, but this beauty has me thinking... Perfect hot summer night BBQ brew. Grilled Shrimp and Pineapple... Honey/Maple glazed Chicken... Mmmm..."
"All in all, Southern Tier has done a great job with Unearthly. I feel it's far from a traditional IIPA, but that's what makes it so damn interesting. It's not the hopbomb you might expect, but I find myself going back to this and Smuttynose's Big A IPA time and time again."
"Drinkability. So-so drinker. Sweetness and booze presence hold this one back a little."
"The alcohol is well masked for the high abv. Solid, even if a little too sweet for my liking, DIPA."
"For a double IPA this is very easy to drink, not heavy malt body but full of flavor."
"Very enjoyable beverage this one is!"
"D-Very drinkable, would never have guessed that this is 11% abv."
"Un-earthly has an astringency that lingers. But, as a whole, this is a very drinkable beer...and quite delicious."
"I love the flavor profile of Unearthly, I just wish it was more balanced. The flavors are enough to make this one a winner."
"IPA candy... balanced sweet and bitter with fairly rich impression. pine and spruce mingled with tangerine on the nose with a whiff of charred sugar. mellow pine laced with tropical fruit and subtle lemon and super mellow grapefruit.. thick yet prickly mouth feel. nice drink. great effort."
"Thick and smooth. Great slow sipping beer."
"(Hey, Southern Tier! What's that Mogen David in the """Un*Earthly"""?)"
"It deserves high marks for achieving its objective. If you want a hop bomb, look elsewhere. If you enjoy a very good hop forward beer that is totally drinkable, you've found it in un*earthly."
"Drinkability: Stronger ABV although the profile is standard fare, thus easy enough to drink but won't stand out in a crowd."
"Bottle is of unknown age. (no dating on the bottles from Southern Tier). I would definitely review this again if I knew it were a fresh bottle. I can imagine a fresher bottle might have more hop character and be really quite awesome."
"Carbonation may have been due to being an older bottle."
"(D) Drinkability on this one was great. The only negitive I found was a slight after taste (which is normal for any Imperial IPA). Alcohol is high so be careful not to over indulge. CHEERS!"
"Overall: a great find. If I can just find where my buddy found it!"
"Conclusion: decent imperial pa but there are certainly better examples out there"
"D- Very drinkable. Hopps smell more aggressive than taste. Sweet cookie middle, nicely balanced and very well hidden alcohol. You should sip, but flavor wise I could drink it very fast. high in alcohol so take it slow anyway."
"This beer pours a copper color with a white head. The aroma smells of citrus hops, and a faint hint of caramel malt. There is a caramel sweetness, but overall you get more of the citrus hop flavor and bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall this is a drinkable beer, the 10% alcohol is very well masked with the hop flavor, bitterness and aroma."
"Out of the bomber, poured a crystal clear golden copper color with a finger of cream colored head. Not a great deal of retention. Lots of sweet caramel malts in the aroma, quite dominant really. You get hints of pine and sweet citrus with the slightest hint of booziness and dark fruit. It's really sweet tasting, but surprisingly, it works. The sweet malty backbone really stands out in the taste. Hops are almost secondary. There's a biscuity caramel malt followed by a very subdued apricot/citrus note. Thick and resiny feel that was very pleasing. The alcohol is almost undetectable. Super easy to drink despite the 11% listed ABV. Even though it was much more malt forward than I'd hoped, this beer is pretty solid."
"medium-full bodied mouthfeel; rich and creamy... very nice. too much to drink a lot of, but one you'll definitely pick up again."
"Beer tastes great, strong hop flavor without being overly bitter which is a pleasant surprise from such an aggressively hopped beer. Hard to believe this is an 11% ABV (per the label) from tasting it."
"One of my first from Southern Tier and I really like everything I've tried so far. Have a couple of more from DIM that I'm anxious to open."
"D/M: smooth and yet really sharp on the pallet, depth of taste makes it really easy to drink"
"D- Dangerously smooth for a brew of such high potency. Reasonably priced too at $4.99. A pretty good find"
"D - It is a bit hot. That's the only knock that I can give it. I love the mouth feel."
"Overall, a very good beer from Southern Tier. Their Imperial series has produced some of the hands down best beers I've ever been fortunate enough to have and this lives up to the rest of them. I like this one a little more than the oaked version, also. I definitely recommend this one wholeheartedly. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Pretty nice. Alcohol is well hidden, not too boozy even when warm. Chuggable despite the high ABV."
"D/N: I'm almost questioning the bottle's claim of 11%. Of course, I've only had half a glass - this beer was unique and delicious and easy to review - so my head hasn't had a chance to swim yet. We'll see. Whatever it is, it goes down easily for the style. Another Southern Tier triumph."
"22oz bomber. Pours a translucent amber color with a frothy thin head. Good amount of lacing. Piney hop aroma with some of that typical Southern Tier sweetness. Slightly floral. Taste is a nice mix of floral and piney hops. Malt flavors as well. The bottle says 11% Abv but it is not overly noticeable. Solid Imperial IPA entry. 2XIPA is better but Unearthly was first and should not be overlooked."
"Slight boozy warm on the finish, but the high ABV is otherwise undetectable. Not overly cloying and extremely drinkable for such a big IIPA."
"D: One of my fav's. Easy to drink, constantly delicious, and always classy. Yup."
"D - It is very drinkable for an 11% ABV beer. I picked this up thinking that it was going to be a hop-bomb, but I was very wrong and pleasantly surprised. It is a bit of a slow sipper, but it is very approachable and goes down very smooth. I will definitely be picking this one up again."
"Note than my 22 oz bottle was 11% abv, as opposed to the 10% listed."
"D-- Slow sipper. Plain and simple. Alcohol is very apparent the more you go deeper in this. A little too syrupy for my taste. Could use more pine and grapefruit to offset the malt. Not bad at all but a little too over the top."
"D: A very enjoyable and true sipper at 10% ABV, Unearthly is a DIPA for the hophead who likes a lot of complexity in terms of a malt profile as well. Pairs well with sweets and fruit, you'd probably find a really sharp cheese to have it with as well. Fine to sip and drinkable enough to put back a solo bomber with ease. A warming experience best suited for a brandy snifter, wrapped in front of a fire on a chilly fall night."
"Citrus hop syrup aroma. Doesn't explode with resins as I'd like but it's a sweet hop nectar just the same. Taste is the same citrus syrup. Pretty balanced actually. Mouthfeel is the star here. It's plush, velvety...is nice."
"D-At 10%,not ridiculously hot but still boozey enough to make you take notice.Not a bad Barleywine but not what I look for in a IIPA."
"Pours a nice copper color with a good white head and a bit of staying power. Some nice white lacing. Nose is strong pine, citrus, and earthy hops with a bit of caramel in the back. The flavor is a bit less hoppy but adds a strong amount of bitterness along with a bit of caramel and bread. Nice feel with good carbonation and hop bitterness levels. Much better than the oak-aged version and a really nice DIPA."
"D: although the ABV is masked very well in the beer, I give it a low rating because this beer gave me a hangover for whatever reason. The night before I drank this beer I drank Stone's Old Guardian and was perfectly fine. It may just be me though. I bought this beer for $3 a 22oz. not a bad price."
"D: Yet another delicious DIPA from a great brewery. Very balanced and clean with nice fruity flavors. Alcohol is ridiculously well masked. Time to eat some bread and try the oak-aged version, see my next review. Thanks again Josh for this great beer!"
"D - Mid-drinkability, the large bitterness and sweetness kind of fight each other for control and that affects the end product a bit. However, this beer is very good and I would love to have more!"
"For 10% abv this beer is quite drinkable. It wasn't the hop monster I was expecting, but is very well balanced. Still, I don't think I could have more than one at a time. I'd need a ride home otherwise."
"D-This was probably the best DIPA >= 10% ABV I have had and it comes closer to the DIPA style than the others I have reviewed. A bit pricey, but I wish Southern Tier used bottle dating. I would be very interested in trying this again if I knew it was very fresh."
"d- not the best, the alcohol isn't well hidden here. i was a bit disappointed here."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot whether enjoyed by myself on the porch with friends or shared with friends for a special occasion. I would recommend this beer for an IPA/Double IPA fan."
" A very good beer, but at 11% ABV I would like more hops cause you sure aren't going to drink a lot of this, might as well ruin the tastebuds with one."
"If southern tier was a woman I would totally get rejected after propositioning her."
"D: a real easy pounder,wish it came in 6ers!"
"Ahhh.. this is good."
"Drinkability: If it didn't cost me an hour's pay for one double-deuce bottle, I'd probably drink it every day. Scratch that...if I got seven extra hours a week, I'd probably drink it every day. :-) Very good. I will come back to this one in the future."
"Excellent sipper."
"D - Not one for me. After struggling through the first half, I poured it. This one's proof that bigger isn't always better."
"Southern Tier just came to Columbus thanks to Chris at Boo's. This is my 2nd and if the rest is comparable to this and Mokah the brewery gives Founders a run for it's money."
"Thanks BA bud Cdkrenz. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass this brew has a nice orange amber color with a thick white 2 finger head with an aggressive pour. The head settles into a nice thin cap leaving sticky delicious lacing down the glass. The brews aroma is full of pine needles with nice clove and nutty notes. The taste is not over powering. There is a very strong hop start with a slight butterscotch middle and a mild bitter finish with some brown sugar and caramel malt balance. This brew is not the POW hop flavor I expected. It is balanced, sweet and spicy. Very good brew."
"D-comes in a very big bottle for such a high ABV, this bottle is meant for sharing! As the beer disappears, the taste actually stays quite well, if it weren't for the high alcohol content, i'd be able to drink this all night long!"
"D: Not bad, for an 11% ABV beer. Not a bitter bomb for the style, which may turn some hopheads off. Perhaps a bit too sweet, if anything."
"D: Very drinkable went well with meatloaf."
"My review was written from Unearthly that I had on tap. I have also had this beer many times in bottle. It is one of my favorite beers. Poured into a plastic solo cup, bright copper orange color with a very sticky, huge head. Strong scents of pine, citrus fruits like grapefruit, some pineapple. The flavors follow the scent profile, sticky hops, pine flavors. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple fruitiness. This beer coats your tongue so each sip is more punishing with the hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy. Very drinkable and it will catch up to you because the alcohol is well hidden."
"D: Hides abv well, kind of harsh to sip."
"very good stuff here"
"D - solid, but maybe a few points off because this is more suited towards hoppy barleywine lovers than those of a good, hoppy DIPA. noticeable alcohol and a thick body hurt drinkability of this otherwise solid, but not great brew."
"Overall: A very good DIPA and a new go-to brew for me when I'm in the mood for the style."
"D- great beer, I bought this on a reccomendation from the staff at Hogans Deli in Bangor and I am glad for it!"
"Drinkability: This is a nice, intensely hoppy beer. Not the greatest one out there, but still quite good. This should satisfy even the most hardcore hopheads."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for 11%, makes the bitterness all the more powerful. Definitely a bitter malt bomb. Not quite as good as I remember but good. A bomber is a bit much."
"Good product/beer. Won't buy it again unless I find it on tap. If you see it and feel tempted, go for it."
"Overall- this is one true imperial ipa. i wanted to rate this one with a fresh bottle. that's the negative thing i could say about this beer. i bought 2 22's down the road and both were flat and they sucked. so if you ever grab this and it's fresh it's truely worth the gamble."
"Pours a nice dark amber color with a good two fingers of creamy head and lots of lacing. Hops smell of grapefruit, pine and pineapple and then a hint of sweet malts. Nice mellow hop bite up front with a nice citrus flavor. The sweet malts come through and complement the hops nicely and for 11% the alcohol is hardly noticeable. Full bodied mouthfeel with very light carbonation, very smooth. Good DIPA that I would definitely have again. You can put down the entire bomber easily yourself or share with friends."
"Deep gold amber appearance. Smell has caramel burnt sugar and pine. Taste is like caramel pine needles garnished with orange zest some more deeper citrusy flavors towards the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and oily. Drinkability takes a hit due to he alcohol content and palate destruction."
"The first glass pours a clear dark amber colour with a decent amount of head. The second glass poured a hazy amber. Tastes of bitter hops with a very malty background. Goes done incredibly smooth for 10%. I'm not kidding either, no hint of the alc% at all. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"Surprisingly good all together."
"Something about this beer just sits really well with me. 10%? Really? Could never tell. A fine looking beer, perhaps a shade paler than others of it's ilk but looks tasty and the ample head laced nicely. A really well balanced """text-book""" nose of upfront hops that are starting to fade (travelled a fair distance-can't be helped) and sweet malt. Funnily enough, I think the fading of the hops has actually brought it down to the perfect balance. Maybe fresh the hops might be too much. Don't know. Still, this is a damn fine beer and probably my favourite from these guys so far.."
"D - A decent DIPA but not a memorable one. Would not buy this again."
"Unearthly is one hell of a beer. Fantastic. If I could access this beer regularly, my life would be better."
"Drinkability - For how high ABV this is, it is actually quite drinkable. However, as stated, it is a bit too sweet for me. Still glad I was able to try it."
"D: Too easy-drinking for the ABV... be careful with this one! Quite enjoyable, especially for those who prefer fruitier DIPAs to earthy or piney."
"(mobile review)"
"D. Tastes like a weak barleywine. Not very hoppy. Hopefully better when it is more fresh. Not a DIPA that holds up very well."
"D: A focused, well-rounded DIPA from Southern Tier. This shows some impressive craftsmanship, even though nothing exactly blows me away. I like that this manages to present so many different hop flavors while remaining coherent and enjoyable. How they managed to hide 11% abv is a mystery to me, but this is one drinkable beer."
"Having to chose a favourite DIPA is hard; having to chose my favourite Southern Tier hop-bomb is even harder! Un*Earthly, fantastic as it is, has stiff competition with Hoppe, 2XIPA, Big Red, Backburner, Iniquity, Pumking to name just the heavy hitters (nevermind the IPA, Hop Sun or Harvest Ale!) Ya, this brewery knows hops, they do hops well."
"Pours hazy copper with a very dense head. Aroma is soapy and sweet, with a nice hop sting. The flavor is strong and sweet, with a powerful blast of brown sugar and some limey hops. The bitterness comes in low and inside, like a sneaky citrus punch. The alcohol is sharp and strong, like vodka. The mouthfeel is slick and thick."
"Pours a golden tinged brown color, clean and clear with a nice cap of off-white head. Decent retention and minimal sticky lacing. Scent is a muddled combination of carmel, earthy and floral hops with a background of light grapefruit, pine and citrus. First taste is a rather bitter bite of hops - earthy, floral are dominant with pine and citrus in the rear. Strong toffee, carmel and bready malt backbone, slightly sweet. Fuller side of medium body, oily and thick, minimal bitter aftertaste. A good dIPA that leans more towards the malty sweet end and the hops are slightly muddled."
"D: good smooth and easy, went good with my steak dinner."
"Decent double IPA, I'm of the view this style is over worked and it takes a goo DIPA to keep me interested....this one lost me halfway through the bottle."
"Drinkability - This bomber will be gone in no time. Extremely drinkable, especially for a cooler night like tonight. I could probably attempt a second bomber, it would be a feat due to the stickyness, but the one will be no challenge."
"It's called Un-earthly, and it is."
"D - Well, I can't really detect any alcohol, it drinks really fast, and it's delicious. The only thing is that some people may think it's too sweet."
"This is a BIG DIPA. I tend to prefer something nearer 9% and more attenuated, but for what it is, this is a very nice beer."
"I have now had Unearthly, Hoppe and Gemini and liked Gemini the best of all of them, even though it is a 50-50 blend of the other two."
"A solid east coast DIPA. Hard to get through a bottle."
"D - Must... have... more before the keg taps out I hope to have it again at Smoking Joe's but maybe I will drop 10-11 dollars on a bottle. It's that damn good."
"All in all I say that this beer is remarkable. I am anxiously waiting for the local store to get the Iniquity, Big Red and new Farmers Tan. I need to add them all to my kegerator ASAP."
"D: I think if it was fresh it would probably have more of a hoppy punch. I was hoping for a hop bomb but I guess we only have them on the west coast."
"D-650ml at 11% will leave you a bit light-headed; its quite powerful but also quite good; a definite sipper, but also a great price at around $6.99 for a 650ml bottle"
"F: Bitter with a long astringent flavor that's not as pleasant as it was on the initial taste. Lots of lingering sweet malts, some nougat, citrus hops and a little pine, orange peel too. Long sweetness and astringent hops. A touch of warming booze on the finish as well."
"This is my first Southern Tier beer after wanting to try them for quite some time. A good example of the style, although too much booze knocks off a couple of tenths."
"Tasted from a 650mL bottle. Pours a clear orange amber with a one finger white head that quickly dissipates leaving some lacing. There isn't a whole lot going on with the nose. Some light malt with a light lemon and grapefruit citrus. On the palate, this beer is much more exciting. On the front of the palate, it tastes dangerously hoppy, but that quickly fades to show a very balanced IPA. There are some biscuit flavors, with just a hint of sweetness. The back of the palate is dominated by citrus rind notes. The carbonation is average, with an oily and coating palate and a long lasting bitter finish. This beer is very good. With how balanced this beer is, I would have never guessed that the alcohol would be so high. I would love to drink this beer again."
"I just picked this up at RSVP in Portland, ME. It's my first Southern Tier purchase since they began distribution in Maine. The bottle was warm, so I chilled it in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes before pouring it into my Smuttynose Big Beer Series goblet. The beer pours out with a big tan foam head. Some carbonation is rising in the liquid, which is translucent and has a beautiful rusty orange hue. Swirling the beer leaves a decent amount of lacework. This is a very pretty beer; nearly perfect for the style. The aroma is magnificent. Big, bready hops fill my nose. There is also some pine and malt sweetness. This smells like a hearty beer. The flavor begins with some light grassy hops as soon as the beer touches my lips. Big, artisanal bread malts make up the backbone of the beer; they appear next. On top of the malts are chunky, bitter hops. When I swallow, I can pick up a bit of the alcohol and a lot of bitterness. It is hot, sharp, and in your face. I like it a lot. There is hardly any sweetness, which is equally surprising and impressive. This is pretty full-bodied beer. It leaves a noticeable coat, but not as much as many beers that use the """Imperial""" qualifier. There is average carbonation and some stickiness on my lips. The bitter oils can really be felt on my tongue. For a strong, hoppy beer, this is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't order round after round of Unearthly, but I certainly won't have any problems finishing all 22 ounces by myself. I'm really enjoying this brew. I think it offers great evidence that top DIPAs do not have to come from the Pacific time zone--us folks back east can work our hop magic as well. I'll certainly purchase this beer again."
"Doesn't quite measure up to Iniquity, but a solid brew nonetheless."
"D: This is one of the more drinkable Imperial IPAs I've tried as of late."
"D - It's 10% rated withing reason."
"D - This is quite a nice beer with a good balance of thick, velvety malt and resinous hops, the only flaw I see is that it isn't a DIPA. Someone should really point out to Southern Tier that they have clearly created an American Barleywine in this beer; and a good one at that, The rich, sweet brown malt characteristics blend magnificently with the moderately powerful hop character and each aspect changes and enhances the other. This juxtaposition and mutual transformation is quite pleasant, though it clearly gives the beer more commonalities with great Barleywines than it has with high quality DIPAs. Seek it out, just be prepared to get something a bit different than what the name implies."
"One finger white head, medium-slow dissipation a very long lasting head, significant lacing. Orange amber body, a bit hazy, modicum of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Pretty complex nose, citrus, pine, good malt backbone bread and some sweetness. Taste is hop forward primarily citrus, but overall well balanced with the bready/sweetish malts. Full mouthfeel, good effervescence. A pretty wicked kick at the ABV more of a sipper than a quaffer, but overall a really good DIPA. Well worth seeking out for fans of the style."
"Overall, a pleasant IPA with a nice rye backbone. More sweet than bitter and very full bodied. A nice twist on a big IPA. The spice of the rye really sticks out for me."
"Overall - Very good, like most American IPAs, but not quite up with the best. Probably significantly better when fresh."
"Nontraditionally sweet for a DIPA, but a decent beer overall. I might drink this again if there's nothing else interesting around to drink."
"Overall an above-average Double IPA, more like a barleywine to me."
"If you blindfolded me and put this in front of me I'd swear its a barleywine. A solid beer."
"A really well crafted IIPA. i love southern tiers products so far and cant wait to try more"
"D-Very good. With 10+% ABV you better take it easy."
"This is my second go with Unearthly. First time around I think my palate was not developed enough to fully appreciate the bitterness. Bomber pours into tulip a dark amber, almost reddish hue, with sizeable eggshell color head that leaves tremendous lacing about the entire glass. Surely is on the darker side for an IPA, but can be expected due to its """Imperial""" status. Smells of light hop, and more malt than expected. Alcohol twinge also touches the nose after a hefty whiff. Taste on this bad boy is surprisingly malty, seems to be more pronounced than the hop bitterness. That malt backbone makes itself known, but is followed up sharply by a stinging slap of hops on the taste buds. Surely an interesting spin on the """Imperial""" IPA. Feeling this one out is a real pleasure, tingly on the palate, also the slick and oily characteristic that is so often associated with IPAs is present. For such a """big""" beer, the drinkability is certainly above average, just because it does taste so damn good. In my eyes, Unearthly has certainly redeemed itself. I may be picking up more bombers of this just to have around."
"D: Great beer, I don't really like English IPA's that much, but I did enjoy this quite a bit. Thought it could be more hoppy though."
"Drinkability: I was a bit scared my girlfriend was not going to like this one, even though she's a huge fan of 90 Minute IPA, but she ended up liking it alot. The hops in the beer are in full force and the presence of malt really smooths thing out and makes it a easy drinker. Some might be turned off by the agressive alcohol heat but it actually is pretty pleasing. I will definetley have this one again!"
"An interesting beer, not entirely on-style, but I've never been a stickler for that. Certainly worth a try. Next time I'll try it a bit cooler."
"I still don't like it. It's way too alcoholic, with high levels of not pleasurable bitterness. It's one of the most difficult-to-drink beers I've ever tried. Somehow, other DIPAs or barleywines at or near this strength manage to be tasty and drinkable, yet this in my mind fails. I think 11% is much too much for this, I still maintain it should be closer to 9 - in fact I think all of ST's big IPAs should be scaled down in alcohol a notch or two."
"Overall: This one's been in my fridge for more than a few months now. In fact I honestly don't remember when I bought it, so this cellaring of sorts could've muted the hops. Even still, this is a great beer. Definitely worth seeking out if you're a hophead."
"Interesting that the abv has apparently been creeping up on this one. ST website lists 9.8, BA 10.0, and the bottle 11.0%. Making this beer bigger in the wrong way... more hops please."
"d - I enjoyed this beer a lot. Nice smooth malts and citrus hops combine for a very pleasant mixture. Would definitely try again."
"drinkability: I'll try this again when the next batch comes out."
"another very well made dipa. good balancing act with malt alcohol and hops and well concealed strength. excellent"
"D- I have waited to try Unearthly for a long time and the wait was well worth it. Overall, it is a solid DIPA that I will definitely be purchasing again. Recommended!"
"Medium drinkability. This one cannot be rushed through. Thick texture. Long finish."
"Good mouthfeel, but overall a great beer. Lots of malt in this thing makes it awkwardly balanced, but huge."
"D- very very drinkable for a big 11% IPA. well done."
"This is very good stuff. It helped me change my mind about ST."
"D - Dangerous beer as the ABV is very hard to pick up until you stand up after finishing the bottle. This is an excellent sipping beer but almost too good to sip!"
"A nice Double IPA. A small adjustment in the viscosity or carbonation levels would make this one a real winner."
"Love everything I had tried so far from Southern Tier, but this one was a miss. I won't be having this one again."
"Overall I was much more impressed with this beer this time around - I feel as though the bottle I had may have been past its prime. Another solid beer from ST and well worth a shot."
"D: The big malt finish balances out the hops. A very easy drinker and a very nice example of a well crafted beer. I am a big fan of Southern Tier and this is one of their best."
"Tried this beer on-tap at The Black Squirrel in Adams Morgan last night. It was a good-looking beer.. nice 2""" cream head atop a reddish caramel body. The smell was of grain, hops, sugar, and spice - black pepper perhaps, with a touch of honey and grapefruit. The taste was a lot more bitter than I would have expected. I found it too bitter for my taste, although I consider myself a bit of a hop head. It was similar to Stone's IPA, but less balanced. I'd have it again, but it wasn't my favorite for this style."
"D - Had been looking forward to trying this one, gets better as the temp rises. I don't recommend more than one 22oz unless being drunk is your thing."
"D: The ABV is nowhere to be found and it's an insanely smooth drinker, very dangerous for a beer of this strength."
"Drinks well and easy, . . wish I had another bottle."
"D - I wouldn't drink too many of these. I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped. But I would not say this was terrible I'm sure many people love this and I do not begrude anyone there.. this is a complex beer.. i'm tasting more hops now.. i just burped and i taste the citrusy taste i do like.. What ruined this was that I recently had a southern tier gemini IPA and that was very good. It made me look forward to trying this.. but then again that was $2 more so i can see why..."
"Malty, hoppy, sweet are all combined in the taste. How can a beer with such a high IBU rating tate so balanced? A huge, let me say that again, huge presence. And where is the alcohol? While it is noticeable in the drinking in the taste, it is disguised to a remarkable degree. This is an excellent DIPA. Immense taste and great balance. I keep commenting on the balance but that's the most remarkable characteristic of this beer. It's not at all well mannered like a Pliny the Elder but it succeeds as a full on palate assault. I've got to get another."
"Apperance is a lovely hazy deep copper-gold. Dense sustained foamy head. Spotty lacing. Nose is strong and unpleasant to me. Murky dark stewed fruits like prunes, raisins, mangos, apricots and some hops but generous to a fault. This is unrestrained deep malt flavor that rests on the tongue. Taste is similar with a really bad band aid phenolic taste to boot. Finish is ashy tasting and feeling also unpleasant. Mouthfeel is nice while drinkability is low due to taste and aroma. I did not enjoy this beer."
"Mmm a nice big beer. Thick, chewy malt body and intense hops explode on your pallet. I had no idea it was 10abv until afterwards, I would have guessed 8.5ish. Definitely well-balanced. I love the pine. For an ale of this size, it's definitely drinkable, even in the early afternoon :) I highly recommend it."
"D: If you like DIPAs, this is a great, highly drinkable example, but it's no session beer. Balance is the key here, as opposed to using the ludicrous hopping as a crutch."
"Skål!"
"Aquired in a trade with beerbeerbeerbeer. Thanks! Poured from the bomber into a pint glass. The beer is a clear, dark copper color with two fingers of dense white foam that bubbles over the rim. Smell is of spicy, piney hops. Some citrus notes but they are secondary to the pine. Tastes of piney spice, and bitter hops backed by sweet malts. Some caramel, but by the time it reaches the back of the tongue the hops have regained control with a vengance. Finish is dry and bitter just the way I like a big DIPA. Feel is right for the style with enough bubbles to keep things lively, and a viscosity level that sticks to the mouth but is not too thick. ABV is well hidden making this a very drinkable beer. IMHO this is an excellent DIPA, that I am glad I got the opportunity to try. If it was available in Cali I would buy it on a regular basis. Recommend!"
"D- The drinkability takes a hit because of the high ABV and the fact that this one is pretty bitter and does a number on the palate after only one bomber."
"Poured 22oz bottle in tulip glass; doughy and fruity aroma; opaque amber color with light cream colored head; sweet very bitter taste but good balance and not much trace of alchohol considering the 11% ABV; nice creamy texture on the pallate with very flat carbonation and long dry finish; good brew better than average."
"Huge carmel malt backbone. Slightly chewy texture. Medium bodied, although I consider this beer on the cusp of full. Very boozy, wish the alcohol was better intergrated. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly syrupy. Beyond full flavored - big time overripe melon, toasted malt and orange oil. There is a continuous onslaught of sweet and bitter. These elements seem to both complement and contrast so the end result is something quite round."
"This is a great example of an East Coast IIPA. Lots of hop character and a decent malt backbone to hold it all up."
"It's hard to believe this is 11% alcohol, as it is masked very well. It is a little oily, but very refreshing and well balanced. I have had much bigger and bolder IPA's, but this one is all about... smoothness and flavour."
"Good stuff. Nice hop brew that I enjoyed very much. Well done."
"I like all of Southern Tier's beers and am especially impressed with their willingness to experiment with ingredients, styles and flavors. Unearthly, as a double IPA, is not my favorite because it's always a little strong to me. The draft, I have to say, is better than the bottle and I would have it again. Great flavor, much smoother than the bottle version, good balance of alcohol, malt and hops."
"This brew pours a deep orange hue with little carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and sporadic lacing,the aromas are piney,citrus infused hops,it has a full weighty mouthfeel which feels abit syrupy at times with tastes of medicinal piney hops,passionfruit and it finishes with a little touch of bitter lime quite a nice drop thats easy enough to down but would of liked a drier finish."
"Overall not the best DIPA i've had but it's not bad by any means, or even average. Good stuff but not as good as others"
"Crystal clear amber color with a thick foamy head. The smell was citrus based with hints of orange, lemon and pine. The taste was good overall with a nice citrus bitterness. There is a very faintly sweet undertone that I can't place, but that I don't like. I may be biased since the other southern tier beers I've tried were much to sweet for my liking. The carbonation was spot on. The drinkability was only hampered by the weird artificial-sugar undertone, and the lingering bitterness. Were there a drier finish and no weird undertone I would absolutely love this beer."
"D - ABV can knock you around rather easily - note that the bottle says 11% instead of 10%. Not at all filling. Flavors, while DIPA like, are pretty manageable for the style."
"Overall- Crazy big. This is one of those DIPAs that seem to favor a bigger malt presence over the bittering hops, which is fine by me. A huge offering, tasty."
"Taste is really hoppy, bitter and sweet. It's a very good IIPA with a nice malty backbone. Really underrated. Worth trying if you haven't."
"A six-dollar bomber that has more alcohol than a six-pack of most light beers-- yep, this one does the trick. Big ass beer."
"Edit: Should not have taken this on alone. This beer is kicking my arse!!! That 11% sneaks up on you, i'll tell you that much. That being said, I don't have too many friends who i'd share a beer like this with."
"Sister sent me a 22oz bomber of this from my hometown brewery. I've had this beer several times but just now getting around to reviewing it. Nice deep amber, copper pour with a modest quickly fading head and decent lacing. Huge malty sweet nose with hints of pine and candy. Tons of syrupy, sweet slighty toasted bitterness up front with some perfumy notes at the back of your tongue. For me it's borderline too sweet, but as you work your way through a bomber it mellows and balances out enough to make it quite enjoyable. The alcohol, as always with Southern Tier, is extremely well hidden. And for such a big, in your face hop monster, it's really quite drinkable, especially on a day like today when it's cold as hell outside. Can't think of a better way to stay warm then with a bomber of Southern Tier!"
"D: well the bomer didnt last to long. but the high alchol has me feeling quite nice"
"Drinkability: This is a very aggresive beer so having more than one in a session would be unlikely. With that in mind I was impressed with this beer. I would prefer a little less malt and sweetness but that's really my only minimal complaint."
"Very drinkable for the high ABV, in the realm of DPA's it would be a close contender to Dorado Double IPA and Great Divide Hercules but would ultimately finish in their wake..."
"Pours a clear orange color with more than a finger of yellow stained head. Nice bit of lacing all around the glassware. Nose is a blend of hop spices and citrus minorly resembling orange zest. Little bit of alcohol bite in the backend along with malty mixture in the aroma as well. Taste is a well mixed blend of hop bitterness that is a little herby/earthy, solid amount of malt sweetness and a bit of the alcohol edge that is warming in the finish. Medium feel with low carb."
"Mouthfeel, hey, same coming in as going out, one of the most drinkable 11% beers I've ever had (excluding Pliny da Younger)."
"Poured a nice amber color with a 2 finger white head that went away in a few minutes. Massive stucky lacing left on the glass. Smelled piney, little bit of citrus, bready. Taste is really nice. Expected to be a hop bomb but its very well balanced. The hops shine through but a massive malt backbone keeps them in check. Mouthfeel is nice but it's certainly on the thicker side of things. Its an 11% dipa so its to be expected. Drinkability is higher than expected as well but with an 11% abv I dont know how many you could realistically drink in one sitting. Its an ass kicker for sure but a good one at that. This and gemini are 2 nice dipa offering from southern tier."
"Really good DIPA, incredibly balanced. Very well done."
"D - Medium but only because of the higher ABV."
"D - Not bad, but high alcohol makes this hard to do tons of."
"Orange-red color kind of threw me. Smelled like, flowers, soap, pine, and slight malt. Taste was spicy, soap and hoppy with a severe alcohol presense. Drank two pints in a half hour, so it wasn't half bad. I'd still choose other DIPA's before I go back to UnEarthly."
"Time for the Oak Aged one."
"CHEERS!!"
"I've had this beer many times and I really enjoy it. This is one of my favorite East Coast DIPA's that I get whenever I see it released. Probably not as good as the best of the west coast ones but still very good."
"As an Imperial IPA, it works very well. However, I'd expect more from a beer of its statue other than an overly high ABV level. Hops can only carry a beer so far, and it seems like this doesn't add much to the genre. Whatever flavor that is added by the oak barrels is lost in the over-hoppiness of the beer. It seems an Imp IPA that has lost sight on what it supposed to accent it. Still, it's a very nice IPA to take in, but not what I was expecting."
"Overall this is a pretty weak dipa. The appearance is boring, the aroma is light, and the taste is distracting."
"@ Sierra. Nice amber color with a sweeter double IPA aroma and that nice grapefruit. Big flavor and the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Very full bodied. Had Pliny the Elder on teh same night and they are both much different beasts. Love'em both. Clearly one of the best east coast doubles, also Captains reserve is in this same category. With the % being so high I think this one holds its own."
"Pours clear and deep gold/amber in color. A very light lacy white head emits a vinous, floral hop aroma. Flavor begins with a sweet, tart earthy hop bitterness. A highly carbonated brew with a perfect mild body for the style. The bubbles fizz into a vinous flavor with sweet malt background. The 11% alcohol comes across firmly at the finish and maintains the earthy hops and vinous flavor as it fades slowly."
"D-Very good. With 11% ABV you better take it easy. One bomber and I was feeling good."
"The initial flavor profile has a rich caramel sweetness mixed with a pronouncedly bitter top note. Caramel and brown sugar mix with a sticky sappy bitterness. Finish brings herbal and menthol essences along with an alcoholic bite. Tastes like a hop forward American Barleywine. Fairly nice taste, though far from the mark of IIPA. Full body with medium-low carbonation. Again, feel is nice, though too heavy for an IIPA. Would be hard pressed to drink a full bomber of this one on my lonesome, but a nice full bodied brew to share with a friend."
"Drinkability: I am not a hop head, but this did not do it for me personally. I think this is a one max per sitting beer. The bitter taste is dominant, but the bready backbone threw me off. I have had better in the style."
"Overall Impression - Judging by the gravity information on the side of the bottle they were able to ferment this down pretty far, but it is still a bit cloying. There is a definite lack of hops (both in flavor and bitterness) in this beer. More hops would also cut down on the cloying sweetness. It's a good beer, but I don't think it's worthy of some of the other notable DIPAs."
"Drinkability: definitely a sipper. at 11%, this one will sneak up on you."
"Huh. I'm going to assume that this bottle had some age on it. Please regard this review as such. All in all, a good beer for sure, but just shadows of what I think it is meant to be. I would love to try a fresh bottle and compare my findings. For all I know this IS a fresh bottle. Still, I'd recommend this beer."
"Overall I find this beer to be a very nice east coast DIPA that is crafted with the utmost quality. Recommended."
"Whether you're an east coast or west coast fancier, this is simply an outstanding double IPA. I'm planning a trip back to VA so I can pick up some more."
"OVERALL: A little underwhelming for the style, but that makes it quite drinkable. Not a hop bomb like a lot of these Imperial IPA's, and probably not quite as drinkable as their Hoppe, but a good beer on its own."
"M/D - Sticky mouth with a creamy sort of carbonation. Decent drinkability for such a high alcohol beer."
"This certainly isn't your typical DIPA. It definitely lives up to its name. Worth the $8 I paid for it for sure."
"Notes: This is a serious rival to ST Choklat as my favorite beer of theirs and also bumps up Southern Tier Brewing Company on my mental list of great breweries. Really well done!"
" ~ This is a great brew. I'm lucky to have it. I recommend to all fans of IPAs, give it a shot. Thanks again to Mike and Ranee."
"D- The disconnect between the hop and malt characters were a bit let-down for me... and at 11% ABV, I don't feel PARTICULARLY compelled to go out of my way again anytime soon... but I certainly wouldn't turn it down if a friend were offering!!"
"Overall, I'm not sure if I liked this better than the Oak Aged or not. Both are very good but Unearthy seems to take the cake. I like the bitterness and the hops better than the Oak Aged taste. Another good one from Southern Tier."
"Poured in a nice amber color, and with little foam. The smell was of spicy hops, artificicial, foamy candy and sweet caramel. The taste was strong on alcohol, sweet, with a distinct licorice note and a dry end. It was the thick, solid taste of good quality brew but maybe not quite up to my expectations on an excelent imperial pale ale."
"D- definitely no problem taking down my serving. it's even later in the night, and it's still going down very easily."
"Overall, the beer has pretty decent balance with a nice malt backbone. The quick fade of the hops is a bit disappointing, but at least it packs a good punch at first. I think this is a solid, fairly standard DIPA; it's pretty decent and I don't really have anything negative to say about it, but certainly nothing to write home about."
"for someone who is really into malt bombs this is a great way to get into hoppy brews this beer was excellent"
"D-Only had about 5 oz, but very drinkable given the abv. 11%?! Wow."
"Orange amber with a huge creamy tan head that leaves rings of sticky lace behind on the glass as it slowly melts. The nose is citric hop notes and molasses. The flavors of grapefruit and orange with dark fruit and caramelized brown sugar work nicely together forming a really well balanced and different DIPA. The alcohol is very well hidden for such a big beer. The mouthfeel is medium heavy with smooth carbonation. A good drinking well malted beer that walks a fine line between barleywine and DIPA."
"The aroma has pine, wood, citrus, caramel, and incense. The appearance is hazy amber with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma with a robust hop character as well as plenty of sweet malt to balance. The palate is smooth and full. Overall this is a rich beer despite not being super complex."
"D: Awesome for this kind of beer... and dangerously since it is 11%."
"I would rate the drinkability much higher were it not for the sweetness, but I will say that one major positive of this aspect of the beer is how effectively it hides the sizeable 11% ABV. Ultimately I'd say this is a good double IPA, but they didn't really knock it out of the park with this one."
"D: surprisingly drinkable for such a high gravity beer. Not an IPA person but I'd buy again. Be careful, easy to overdo!"
"Notes: This is a great DIPA, it might fall a bit short of making it to my top-notch preferences but it is close. The iconic ST sweet notes are again welcome but something does not make it click for me to push it to a next level that it is terribly close to make. In any case I´m always happy to have and share this brew when available."
"Easily my favorite Southern Tier brew, as I have been mostly disappointed with their offerings. I'll try more, but I have a feeling it will take a lot to dethrown this guy. Highly recommended for any hophead."
"This is a great DIPA that has a sh*tload of hops but an solid malt backbone to balance it out. Does an insane job of hiding the 11% ABV. I've not been very impressed by Southern Tiers products but this is good beer. Respect!"
"All in all, I'm disappointed. It's pretty clear that this particular bottle has lost it's hop character. Not the brewers fault though."
"The interesting things is - the sweet nose doesn't come through on the palate. The palate is nicely balanced between the malts and piney hops that it's really enjoyable!"
"I really enjoy this beer, and will have it again. It's not a session beer by any means, which is why my drinkability score is lower. But for a single bomber (or pint), it's definitely top notch."
"Drinkability - an astounding """very much so!""""
"This packs a punch but has a great malt backbone. Lots of hops but that is to be expected. Quite a beer."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer, it was a good example of a DIPA (and from the East Coast), I would not mind having this one again"
"Drinkability: Very powerful DIPA that is a nice sipper, but I honestly expected more, whether bitterness or smoothness or dryness or a true taste explosion. It certainly doesn't need more alcohol, as I am mostly left with boozy hop oil; of course, that is still quite tasty."
"Drinkability: Highly quaffable, but the 11% ABV is definitely there to remind you to drink this one slowly. This is a great Sunday afternoon beer, and one that will continue to have a place in the beer cellar around here."
"Just superb. A heavyweight beer that goes down like a session ale. One to keep around for special times."
"D- This is almost a trainwreck of a beer. It's not the right style in my opinion. It's not a terrible beer but it's kind of thrown in together and see what comes out. Would have had a little higher rating if it was well...labeled as just an IPA. Will try again later when I feel up to it."
"Pours an amber orange color with a huge head that retains throughout the journey. Moderate lacing and carbonation. Smell is pine hops to the max, caramel, alcohol, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is hoppy as hell, which is a delicious thing. As it warms up it gets a little sweeter and the booze starts to come out. The finish is an all encompassing bitterness, take it or leave it. Personally I enjoy the bitterness, but drinking more than maybe 2 glasses of this may prove difficult. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and doesn't really stack up with the rest of its attributes."
"Pours a orange-reddish amber color with a one - two finger head that leaves medium lacing on my glass, beautiful color on this one, nice and clear. Smells of pine hops and some malts that turns into raisins and a bit of alcohol with hops, good smell here. Tastes extremely bitter with citrus and piney hops, also get the raisins in here, some alcohol shines through, malts which contribute some sweetness, a tiny bit too much alcohol taste here for me. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with pretty high alcohol warming that leaves a piney/raisiny aftertaste, not my favorite after taste. Drinkability is decent here, alcohol and raisiny taste will overcome the hops for me after a while, this is definitely for you if you love bitterness though, glad I picked this one up."
"This one was too thick and boozy for me. There are just so many good WC IPAs that I would have to give this one a pass. I would give it another shot fresh from the tap."
"A typically big Yankee DIPA, both in volume, and in flavour."
"A half or full glass would make a decent apertif."
"D - A bit to sugary and heavy IMO. I could stand to see a bit more hoppage in this one, with a reduction in residual sugar. Not bad, but I probably won't be revisiting this one. And sorry about that Hawaii tangent... that's just the vibe I get."
"D- You know what you're walking into when you start sippin' on an imperial ipa. Some are just too much to take down to enjoy a second one, while others leave you confused as to why it's called a double/imperial ipa. The Unearthly in my opinion is the perfect balance of flavor, mouthfeel and drinkability to satisfy the everyday hophead. The only drawback is it's aroma. As Flavorful as it is I would expect a little more in the bouquet."
"D - Very enjoyable. The alcohol is well hidden."
"This a great DIPA, very well balanced with just the right mix of hop punch and big malt flavor."
"The texture/mouthfeel leaves me with the sensation of just having had some caramel."
"Definitely not a bad beer, and wasn't terribly expensive at $6.99 a bomber. Just don't expect anything over the top."
"There is a large alcohol presence in this beer and it will zing you on the way down... the taste is refreshing, but it's not all that drinkable in the sense that you'd want to have glass after glass (such is the difficulty with a lot of big IPAs, I guess...). You'll certainly get through the bottle though!"
"pours a hazy golden orange color from 22 oz. bomber with 1/2 inch head an a nice ring..smell is typical dipa ..hops grapefruit grass malts..taste is the same its not outstanding but good its a creamy piney hop forward dipa with an ok malt background however there are way to many dipas and ipas for me to buy and this one does not stand out ...this one again its not one ill reach for but one to try.. so recommended only if you have not tried it"
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich copper color with at least an inch of fluffy off white foam. The head leaves a moderate layer of lace on my glass as I sip my way to the bottom. Nose and flavor consist of resinous pine, a nice dose of caramelized malt, citrus such as lemon and orange, toasted bready grains, alcohol is quite noticeable. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. A bit too boozy for my tastes, but still a tasty DIPA."
"D -- For an Imperial IPA, not bad at all. Not one of my favorites, though."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades quickly leaving a very good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Light sweet piney nose. Flavor follows the nose - sweet piney hops with mild bitter aftertaste. High ABV totally hidden. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Overall- A good beer. Definitely not a hop bomb. Somewhat comparable to left hand twisted sisters IPA because of the good balance and strong malt backbone."
"The hops taking a relative backseat hurts the mouthfeel. I fail to appreciate any textures the pale malt or wheat bring to the table. The caramalt sweetness is just okay, and--again--not really what I'm looking for from an IPA. My take on drinkability aligns with basically every other reaction to this beer--it's okay at best. For an $8.50 bomber, it simply doesn't cut it."
"This one is a dangerous 11%. It goes down very easy and leaves you wanting another."
"The bottom line: if you're acclimated to hops and you want something that is pretty well-balanced for the style, then Unearthly is a a good pick-up. I don't think it breaks any real ground in the style, and it's probably not big enough for the hop heads, but for someone like myself, who appreciates big hop beers but tends to like malt bombs more, it's a nice change of pace."
"Pours deep-gold and slightly hazy. The nose is immediate with forward hops and sweet grain notes reminiscent of grape-nuts cereal. Clean, clear. deliberate hoppy notes. When poured an off-white-tan head forms with creamy top and medium to small bubbles below. Half-inch head stays till the bitter end. Medium body with hop throughout the palate. The hops is countered with malt notes that evidence sweet caramel, toasted grain and toffee. Hints of leather. Average carbonation. Creamy texture. Pleasant bitter lingering with notes of sweetness. The alcohol is not evident on the palate, but with 11% ABV this ale warrants caution. Moderate to marked lacing. The flavor is long-lasting. This ale is excellent on its own, but would be great with food that needs a bitter or structured accompaniment. Would be an excellent aperitif."
"For the amount I'd heard about this beer it was a little disappointing, but still good."
"Pours a copper orange color with a little head. The smell is very strong of hops, citrus, and some caramel malts to it. The taste is of big hop flavor, citrusy hops and some other citrus notes. There is also some caramel malt included to balance out the bitterness of the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry, lightly carbonated. Overall this is a very good IPA especially for the high alcohol content."
"A very nice beer. Can't wait to try the oak age version..."
"Conclusion: This is a bit brash for me...interesting, but nothing real special; a buddy and I split this bomber as our nightcap after an evening of tasting...1 bottle for two was definitely enough"
"Very drinkable for the ABV, and you can almost get away with putting away two of these a night."
"Purchased a bomber last night, chilled it, and drank in the evening. Wonderful hop aroma, nice copper color, with a fluffy tan head that laced the glass evenly throughout consumption. The taste was reminiscent of Flying Dog Brewery's Double Dog DIPA, possibly due to the high alcohol content of both beers. The taste is slightly coppery with a strong hop presence and a definite alcohol finish."
"I really liked this, I saved it for about 8 months or so and finally decided to break it out. I was a little worried about the flavor being a little compromised from this bottle because I had it in the fridge and had to move. It was in the fridge then went back down to room temp during the move, it happened again after taking it to a a friends for his birthday but we didn't end up drinking it then either so it went back down to room temp again. So this bottle survived two to major temperature changes. Well to the appraisal. From a bottle poured into a Sam's perfect pint glass. This beer had a great look to it, slightly darker than a normal IPA, almost a quality lager. Had a golden color, not completely clear with the slightest of slightest haze. Had some pretty good lacing to it too, lasted the entire drink. Smells is good, has a nice strong hoppy smell to it. Tastes great nice strong and refreshing hoppy taste. The taste lingers on a bit which is really nice. Had very good mouthfeel and drinkabiliy as well. Very nice drink to have, especially on a nice summer or warm spring day. Great brew from Southern Tier, highly recommended."
"A little bit thicker and sweeter than the Hoppe but still way too drinkable for the ABV. You either like the big moutfeel of ST beers or you don't. I do like the way the beer balances out with lots of malt and a smoothness that really shows up in the finish. Not the most complex DIPA but certainly well made and very refined."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Pours a dark orangey gold color with a creamy white head. Sweet caramel aroma with grapefruit and a more resinous, piney hop note as well. Flavor is too sweet, lots of caramel and sugar, sweet hop notes, decent herbal piney finish, bitter finish. Not bad and certainly very hoppy but file this one under 'diabetes-causing' with the other ST beers."
"D- Pretty high. I was worried about the sweetness at first, but I'm really enjoying it now."
"- Overall very drinkable for being so strong... hides it well.. but has a bit of excessive carbonation for me for the style..."
"A very, very good beer. I understand how I used to like it. It's actually sort of """balanced""" which is a crazy thing to say. But it has a lot going on, and really prevents those sweet malt burnt taste from dominating. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"This is certainly a big bad IIPA, if you like sucking on the hops you'll like this one"
"Drinkability: Dangerous. You can't tell this is an 11%er until you have too many and try to find your own bathroom. I really liked it. I prefer citrus hops IPAs over overly bitter hops IPA."
"This beer started out great, but really wore on me in a bad way as the bottle warmed."
"This is a member of the rotation for sure. Get it if you see it!"
"Very good IPA."
"D: I've definitely found a few of ST's imperials to be pretty cloying. But they came correct with this one. A very nice DIPA."
"D: The bottle of this was a little over a full pint, and I was looking to share after my first snifter full. Not that it is bad; it is just a little overwhelming with the citrus."
"Conclusion: both versions are really good beers that don't overstep their bounds with too much maltiness, too much bitterness, or too much hop flavor - and yet all of those are present in abundance. Nicely balanced. Nicely rounded. Nicely drinkable. Certainly worth trying!"
"D: This is a piney, bracing version of an IPA, but balanced with enough sweetness to make it somewhat refreshing. There is a saltiness on the finish, which somewhat deters me from craving another."
"After sharing a 750 I'm ready to move on from one of these, but I keep coming back. I doubt there's another supermarket-available Imperial IPA that can match it."
"Drinkability: This was an interesting one...it wasn't bad, but I'm not sure it's the best representation of the style. One was enough (obviously, considering the ABV), and I'm not sure I'd reach for this one again. I wish Southern Tier dated their bottles, because I don't think I got an old one, but it'd be nice to know for sure."
"Best wishes on this one, definitely in my top 5, maybe 3. Hoping to get some on tap one of these days."
"I expected a hoppier brew here. Sweet smooth and could potentially get you in trouble at 11%."
"D-Pretty good. It's a tasty beer, not terribly remarkable, but a consistent performer."
"Overall- great beer, brewer paid a lot of attention to the mouthfeel and appearance of this beer with the use of the carapils and red wheat malt as noted on the bottle..enjoy my friends."
"Kind of reminds me of DFH 90 minute IPA. Highly recommended."
"A decent, average to above average DIPA. Higher strength and more alcohol presence than others."
"Drinkability: For a DIPA, it is very well balanced and smooth. Hops are present but don't over dominate the beer. Very tasty brew, I will pick up another next time I see it."
"Hard to tell if I have an old bottle or not. No bottled on date but based on other reviews it has to be. I sense no hint of fresh hops and the beer seems thin maybe mellowed for a double IPA. It's hard to believe this beer has 11% abv. Yeah it gives you a warmth to the belly but I've had 7 percenters that had more kick. Despite the negativity this is a tasty beer. I don't think in it's current form presented to me, is it a IIPA but I still enjoy the medium body and the bitterness. I will have to find a fresher one and see if there is a difference."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle it pours a bright orange, light copper color with a white one finger head. The head leaves ok lacing down the glass and the head fades away fairly quickly and becomes very thin but is still apparent. Smells of hops, sweetness, some fruit. Pretty good smell ovreall. The taste is very sweet and not bitter at all. Hoppy, sweet, grapefruit, has a very similar taste to many other IPAs I've had and it stands up there as pretty good compared to those. For having an 11% ABV I think it's hidden very well. I'll be able to finish the bomber pretty easily no problem. This is the first beer I've ever had from Southern Tier and I'm finding I'm interested in trying more from them. If this were available in my area I would pick it up again so I'll be looking for it again when I'm traveling."
"Drinkability: I'd definitely pick this up again. I don't know that you want two of these in an evening, but one hit the spot. It's a great sipping beer."
"Overall, I think Southern Tier put forth a pretty solid effort. But, I think they were trying to go for a massive ABV IPA instead of a uber hoppy one. That being said, I would like to see Southern Tier to come out with a Imperial West Coast IPA, which is overloaded with hops and less on ABV and malt flavoring. Very good beer overall though."
"A excellent IPA. Very deceptive and smooth considering the 11% ABV. Highly recommend."
"Worth picking up."
"D: I was planning to have two pints with dinner but couldn't choke all of this down. The hops and booze conspired against me."
"D- Nice brew that is really well balanced but still lets you know that it is a DIPA."
"The beer is thick and heavy with a dry bitter aftertaste, smooth and very drinkable for a double. One of the better double IPA's I have had."
"Shared this bomber with fellow BA Moxley. Poured a hazy golden orange color with an inch of dense white foamy head that reduced to a minimal sheen but left HEAVY lacing. The smell is overly Hoppy. I love it already! The taste is Hop Hop Hop! Floral hops, citrus hops and piney hops with a nice malt backbone and a definate boozy alcohol taste. After 3 or 4 sips the alcohol taste weakens and the hop flavor continues to dominate. It has a nice sticky mouthfeel and is very drinkable, as long as you have someone to drive you home."
"Smell is grapefuit with some sweetness mixed in. The taste is where this really stands out. It is so well balanced for a IIPA, not a hop bomb by any means. I love me some hop bombs, but it is fun to appreciate the other features of an IIPA as well. This beer allows you to do that. A stellar addition to the line-up at the Trion Tavern in New Haven."
"Poured 22oz bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a nice amber-gold color with a thick white head which slowly recedes. Aromas of grpaefruit, light vanilla and honey. Starts off nicely with hop bitterness with a smooth and sweet middle and finishes again with more bitterness. The taste had more of the grapefruit and honey combination. I wished it had a longer finish to it. I actually found this to be quite balanced for a IIPA. It definately doesn't feel like a hope bomb. I quite enjoyed this beer. It is now one of my favorite IIPAs. Too bad they don't distribute in TX."
"I will definitely put this one in rotation as I see it. A good one to have on hand at all times."
"Full body. Plush feel. One of my favorite things about these huge DIPA's is the immensely lush and smooth texture. There isn't a hint of alcohol in this one, despite claims of 11%. Very, very good stuff. Can't wait to taste my bottle of Oak Aged Unearthly."
"D--A bomber of this was just too much. I could drink a pint for sure, but beyond that it becomes a chore."
"Just enough carbonation - not too thick or syrupy, but provides a very nice mouthfeel that will be sure to lure me to buying this bottle again. Only thing is next time I will be buying a few of these instead of just one."
"D: Very drinkable for a Double IPA, the alcohol is hardly noticeable. As the beer warms its sweetness increases and lingers on the palate much longer. I will definitely buy this again."
"I couldn't drink too much of this beer, but I definitely enjoy it. Excellent offering from Southern Tier."
"After hearing much about this beer I finally tracked it down! Out of a bomber this brew was an orange-amber color with perfect clarity and good rising carbonation. The full three-fingers of yellowish head displayed very good retention and consistent, very good lacing. This beer just plain looked great. The aroma was excellent, rich and complex- fruity esters, floral hops, pineapple, orange, pine. The flavors were equally complex, lots of citrus and citrus rind that then gave way to herbal and piney elements along with alcohol and doughy malt that balanced the beer nicely. The 11% was very well-hidden, it drank like a beer half its strength. The mouthfeel was creamy, soft and a touch oily, the body medium/full and the carbonation delicate. The hop complexity was impressive and the beer totally on-point for the style."
"Pours a clear and inviting pale amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, some sweet malt, and faint notes of earthy malt as well. This brew smelled amazing from the moment I popped the cap and only seems to get better. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of a couple types of hop very nicely blended up front, then some earthy malt comes through strongly, there's a general sweetness (brown sugar?) that comes through, there's also a slight pine kick, and the finish is more hop flavor. A slight dryness is associated but not to a bad degree. The finish is very smooth and the overall flavor character is well blended. I highly recommend this brew."
"Drinkability: I could drink these all night. Taste better then most D.I.P.A.'S that cost twice as much. I will buy this again."
"i suppose that you could give this brew credit for """hiding""" the high alcohol so well. but i was also expecting something a little more aggressive flavorwise, especially with the bottle's own description."
"Mouthfeel was fresh, clean. Very easy to drink, although I am sure at 11% abv. it would catch up with you quickly."
"M & D, this is a full bodied imperial that hits you with hops the moment it is poured until the after taste leaves you. A wonderful experience."
"I think it's pretty good. It's definitely not a regular every-day beer, but good for occasional enjoyment. It's very unbalanced; hops just aren't there in the nose or in the taste up front, but come back to grab you after you swallow. A slightly acidic flavor afterward, this beer is sweet and sticky up front. A very heavy beer."
"22. Pours amber with a pleasant frothy off-white head. Excellent aromas of citrus and an explosion of piny hops. Initial flavors are grapefruit and lemon with a strong bitter hop finish. Alcohol is well concealed. Caramel malts with hints of honey aid the finish and balance towards the end of the bomber and actually, in my opinion, make it much more enjoyable than the beginning of the bottle. Worth the experience."
"It's not """hop juice""" but it is very nice nonetheless. I have to admit that I prefer Gemini more but this stands out well on its' own. Pick up a bottle."
"Consumed at Al's of Hampden, Central PA. Very excellent beer. A bit high in alcohol content even for an imperial ipa and a bit sparse on both head and carbonation, but the hop and malt flavor was full and it balanced out the high alcohol content well. I'd recommend it indeed, but not to have more than one at a sitting. Delicious, but not a session beer."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured the typical orangeish-amber IPA color with about a 1/8 inch of of white head. The head semi-quickly dissipated leaving a lot of sticky lacing. A very floral-hop forward aroma with citrus notes. The taste is what the aroma led me to believe what it would be. Mostly hop flavors but some malt foundation for the hops to cling to. Body is average for an ImpIPA, as is drinkability. A solid, but not outstanding, version of the style. This beer very much reminds me of Stone IPA, but obviously with more of a kick. Since that is one of my favorite IPAs, this is a good thing. This beer is worth trying and I will certainly buy it again."
"I have had this on tap and in a bottle and it is consistently been very good. Strong hop and malt smell. It has a nice citrus flavor as well that adds some sweetness but all of the hops bring it back to the taste range that I enjoy. It can finish with a bitter after taste, especially when paired with food, which is why I prefer to drink this without food."
"The lack of an aroma to match the huge taste is disappointing, but not enough to keep this from being one of my new favorites. Highly recommended."
"Served in a Snifter, the beer pours a very Amber color with a medium head. Smell was of fruits and a very strong malt presence in my beer. Now I am not sure how old my beer was do to the fact there is no bottled date on it, it was purchased at a beer shop of the shelf. When tasted it reminded me a bit of the DFH 90min due to the Malt being easily detectable, though in this particular beer it was very prominent. Hops are right there along with it, but I feel that I had an older beer as they were not as strong as I have heard. Unearthly was a very easy beer to drink and very smooth. Medium body and carbonation that was very smooth, and it also did a very good job of hiding the alcohol percentage. It was a good beer and I would drink it again."
"D- seriously, this beer is 11%..? hard to believe until you start feeling it a bit after a couple...very drinkable for the style.."
"Tasted side by side with it's oak aged brother. Pours golden amber with a white head. Hops come out strong in the aroma from the dry hopping. Standard west coast variety hops, chinook, cascade leading to the familiar pine resin aroma. This brew is full bodied and smooth. Hops leave a slight bitterness in the finish but not too much, more of a refreshing bitterness. Solid brew 11% hardly noticable (thats dangerous) it's offset by a sweetness."
"Quite tasty, would get this again."
"D: Again, I am shocked at how drinkable this was, especially at 11% ABV. As the beer warms, it becomes slighty sticky on the palate, and the alcohol checks in, but this is one fine brew! Great offering from Southern Tier, will absolutley be seeking this again. Skal."
"D: I love this beer. I grab at least one bottle a month. Just a really nice example of a big east coast DIPA."
"A decent DIPA, but not an essential one in my book. It goes down surprisingly easy for it's abv, but I think the hops could stand out more, or at least the maltiness could be dialed down some. Southern Tier is one of those breweries I've been hearing of for a long time, so I guess I was expecting more when I finally got to try one of their beers. Perhaps it's been around for a while (though not at where I bought it, where it's a recent arrival).Not bad, but I can drink better DIPAs around here, like the locally brewed Alpha Dog."
"22 oz. Bright golden pour, white head that diminished pretty quickly. Sticks to the dimpled mug very nicely though. Standard piney citrus, more piney aroma with some malt. Malt and biscuit is a little more present in the flavor, with some yellow rainin, which balances out the piney hops. A well balanced big beer, with well hidden alcohol. Not a complete hop bomb. Finish is bitter, but not overly and lingers nicely. This is pretty drinkable, I'd be real careful with the 11% hiding in there. Prefer ST stouts, but this was pretty good too."
"Notes: I love this beer. This is one of my favorite Imp IPA's (along with Avery Maharaja). It's a bit sweet, but the 150 some-odd IBUs take care of that."
"Not extreme; very much not a West Coast IPA. Great balance, no bitterness. Considering the strength, amazingly drinkable."
"this beer is very interesting approach to the style. sweetness and bitterness are balanced but dont necessarily play well with each other. i would prefer it to be fruitier."
"This is overall an excellent beer and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a true """Unearthly""" hop experience."
"Very nice beer all-around. Crystal clear copper color. Pleasant hop aroma. Abundant malt sweetness coming from the big imperial body. Citrus hop flavor, but doesn't finish too bitter. Finishes pretty clean with a nice hop flavor lingering on the tongue."
"For something with 11% ABV it is surprisingly smooth. I would reccomend this one to anyone that likes Southern Tier."
"I drank a bottle and it felt to be just about the right amount. I don't think I'd open a second at one sitting."
"M - Viscous, sticky IPA, with a nice, fluffy, velvety feel."
"Future outlook: This was an OK drink of beer, but not really what I'm looking for when I get a DIPA."
"Pours out a deep amber color with a massive head, 2-3cm, that stays around and leaves a bit of lacing. Just what I'd like to see. The smell is kind of subtle for a DIPA. A bit of an Earthy, herbal smell, with a bit of a crisp floral note, filled with hop resin, but the smells are subdued. The taste is pretty nice. There's a big hit of bitterness, and some good sweetness to balance it out. The hop flavor is very resinousy, with a bit of sweet citrus taste, no peel. A tiny bit of fruitiness from the hops with a big peachy burn from the alcohol. A little less alcohol is really all I'd like to see. Something about the taste really reminds me of a bag of pungent, resinousy hops. The mouthfeel is kind of thin, and the alcohol burn kind of turns my mouth off, but really the resinous feeling is one that I've come to love. It might not be a favorite of others, but I find that it enhanced the mouthfeel here. But I really enjoyed making my way through this beer. I would recommend it to anyone who is exploring IPAs, and is probably my favorite of the Southern Tier Imperial IPAs."
"A top-tier DIPA here, glad to have it on the menu."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D: A very good Southern Tier offering although I like their regular IPA as much and Hoppe a little more for its brightness. Unearthly is hefty stuff with unmatched sharp earthiness that is unique but not exactly my cup of tea."
"Bottle into goblet. Really like this one. Mom is just learning to like IPA's, but kind of a natural reviewer, took one sniff and said """it smells floral and fruity," as if she had been drinking IPA's forever....Poured clear, bronze/orange/golden , fluffy white head that hung around and eventually fell to film and ring, and left good lacing. SMELL is floral and citrus hop blending, as mom noted, with rich malty backbone. Well balanced and blended, complex, smooth, inviting, has long legs. TASTE the malty sweetness, floral and citrus hops, with medium bitterness ascending through the middle, and then lingering a bit. Quite smooth and mostly balanced. FEEL the medium carbonation, medium full body, thick texture, and dry bitter finish. Some warming also. OVERALL a great beer. Drinks really easy for such a big one, but is way too tasty to take more than sips. Savor it."
"13 oz pour in tulip shaped glass at the Sunset Grill, Boston. Golden amber and slightly hazy with a short lived head and no signs of carbonation. Strong aroma of pine and fruit. Extremely well balanced flavor considering the IBUs. Honey sweetness along with strong resinous hops. My tounge crys """Uncle""" as the hops take over through the middle and finish. Medium bodied. I am too exhausted to notice the finish. Thank you sir, may I have another."
"Just an all-around very good brew."
"D: An uninhibited infusion of hops, indeed. High ABV makes Unearthly an evening sipper."
"Wow. Pours into a pint a bright golden orange with only a little haze. A sticky head of dense off-white foam laces the glass throughout. The nose of intense citrus and floral hops rises pleasantly. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky with a viscous pine resin punch ably supported by a malty sweetness and grapefruit citrus structure. The alcohol is obviously present in a warm backing roll. It lingers long, leaving a spicy, oily, pine forest misted in a fog of citrus. As the mouth becomes familiar with the onslaught of hopspice, the backing sweetness of toasted malt becomes more apparent and hints of flowers suggest themselves. Tastes WAY too good and goes down WAY WAY too easy to weigh in at 11% abv. Afterwards, all that alcohol still numbs the mind less than one would think. This is what DIPAs ought to taste like."
"Pours transparent orange with a thick white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citric and floral hops. Grapefruit is present up front. The palate is also a hop party, where the big flavors come out in the finish as hops are accustomed to doing. A nice smelling and tasting bouquet. Creamy, oily and resiny texture. A little sticky as well. It is truly hard to believe this beer is 11% abv. A fantastic IIPA, though short of elite. Amazingly balanced for the abv level, but a little short of the powerful hops aroma and taste I'm looking for in this densely populated style. Still, a great tasting beer."
"D: The balance, mouthfeel, and hidden ABV help to make this one almost too drinkable. I can not believe how easy it is to drink."
"Southern Tier needs to up their game on quality control. Somebody put barleywine in the double IPA bottle. It has the malt forward nose of a barleywine, not to say that the hops don't make their citrusy presence known but they are the supporting player and not the star. Same with the taste - way too sweet and malty for a dipa. Now I thought it was a pretty good barleywine and had no problems making my way through the bomber. The 11% abv was pretty well hidden. But I like dipas better than baleywines generally and marking to labeled style this came up a bit short."
"Notes: Maybe it did not knock my socks off,but I found the balance and overall taste very pleasing. Yeah, maybe it was a tad sweet yet it did not fail to please my palate. I look forward to having this beer and I still did not find the need for a lengthy review."
"Yep, this is the East Coast interpretation of a DIPA. It's much more balanced and lacks bitterness, good for some not for others, I prefer the ST Gemini over this nice beer."
"D-Not a big fan of this one and didn't make it through the whole bottle. I find too much alcohol sweetness in Southern Tier beers that don't compliment the flavors underneath which are usually very good."
"D: This is an excellent drinking Imperial IPA which showcases the hops without being overpowering."
"All around solid IIPA right here. Gladly have one again."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a caramel color with a finger of light tan head. Excellent retention on glass. Smell is like oranges and grapefruit. Taste is very fruity for an IPA but still maintains the common citrus hop taste. Mouthfeel is slightly dry and invites me back for more. Goes down way too easy for 11% ABV. An excellent example of an Imperial IPA."
"I'll start this review off saying that the bottle I had was aged 6 months before I drank it. I've had it on-tap and this bottle was completely different than what I had on-tap. With that said the aging seemed to have taken away some of the bitterness of this beer. The Red Wheat in the beer gives it the nice color. A nice light bronze color with a 1 to 1 1/2 finger head. Lacing is nice and sticks to the glass nicely. The beer is very sweet for an Imperial IPA. I don't know why people think it's a DIPA, but it's not. Smell I get a nice citrus (orangey) and floral hop aroma. For a high abv/ibu beer I get none of it, which I find good about this beer. The sweetness and the bitterness are very well balanced with the on-tap version I had. With this bottle the sweetness was well over the top. Over all this is one of the best IIPA's i've ever had. I wouldn't suggest aging this bottle, but if you can get it on-tap drink it up!"
"The high ABV is very well hidden. Overall flavor is quite mild, hops are present but are not overpowering. Sweeter than you expect for a DIPA, but not in an obnoxious way."
"Pretty good overall, much sweeter than I would have anticipated with the hops being a less dominant force than most Double IPA's."
"Can't say I am blown away by this beer, but it is certainly very good and I am sure I will enjoy again in the future."
"I was really looking forward to this one, but was slightly disappointed."
"A great DIPA. Not your traditional hop bomb flavored bitter beer that I have come accustom too. Instead it's a great balance of malts/hops that creates a unique """unearthly""" taste."
"D: Southern Tier's Unearthly latest Imperial of the IPA category is moving along swimmingly. Instead of an emphasis on one ingredient (hops)of a IPA, you shall take into your smiling mouth malts and other delicious additions to make this a fantastic beer."
"Notes: This beer is better on tap, where the carbonation is a little higher, resulting in a finish that's a little less sweet. It's a shade lighter too."
"Mouthfeel is pleasing.. silky smooth with a tiny prick of carbonation. Drinkability rates average for it's style.. no one in their right mind is going to be packing away many of these in a session!"
"D - Pretty good but also pretty strong. Not to session but mostly enjoyable."
"I bought a bomber for $5.99 tonight and so far so good. Great aroma, the floral/citrus smell of the hops hit me right off the bat. The alcohol content was not overpowering as I thought it might be. There does seem to be something missing, maybe a bit more body would help?"
"I'm not a hophead my any means but the aroma and taste of this beer definatley opened up my palate. Aromas of citrus and rich hops follow through upon tastign with flavors of mango, pineapple, and an earthy bitterness that reminds me of a belgium saison. The best part of this beer is that it is incredibly drinkable. Overall, an amazing DIPA that is complex and delectable at the same time."
"i really like the hop kick from this brew - at first it was overpowering hop-bitterness - now it's mind-blowing hop bitterness! incredible stuff!"
"A very nice beer, truly represents the east coast DIPA. Malty and rich with that earthy and citrusy hoppiness. Not really my cup of tea, but fantastic example of the style."
"A great beer overall and I can see why this brewery is so well respected. It's not easy to make a big double IPA feel both balanced and drinkable and they achieved both with Unearthly."
"Talk about a hop bomb! I think this is a great example of an """eastt""" coast DIPA. The appearance is almost a amber with a nice two finger frothy head. Not much in the lacing departmant though. Smells of straight up hops from the minute I cracked it open. Deffinatly cascade. Same with the taste. Cascade hops shine right through. Might be a little too much for me, but still a great brew"
"Not what I'm looking for in a DIPA and even for what it's worth, I'm not really sure this brew was a success. Quite overrated. So much so, it makes me wonder if this is a bad batch or something?"
"Ive never said that any IPA gives Dogfish 120 a run for its money in terms of true balance of such extreme proportions of ingredient used,but Unearthly steps up to the challenge and delivers."
"This is another Imperial IPA that I find to be too balanced for my liking. Its a very good beer,and my ratings reflect that. I just want a double IPA that is more bitter, drying, hoppy and less malty/sweet. Can I get some CA DIPAs, please?"
"Outstanding."
"Drinkability - A heavenly sipper to quaff for an hour or so. Beautifully blended, and balanced so shockingly well that even the alcohol is hardly noticeable"
"Had a bottle from Sam's in Chicago. Appearence was a deep copper with a bubbly white head that disappated after pouring. The nose bready yeast, sweet malt and citrus hops. The taste is sweet and malty with hop bitterness. I was expecting a hop overload at first. It was more balanced which is the characteristic of an imperial ipa. It was kind of buttery and slick with a slight boozy taste. Not much carbonation and pretty easy to drink. Know what you are drinking before you open it. It fits the style well and is very enjoyable."
"i may try their other beers, but i am skeptical."
"Overall a uniquely tasty DIPA that's very smooth. Will buy again!"
"Drinkability suffered for me because I knew I was not in any position to drink another one of these. I will say this beer was extremely smooth and extremely easy to move through. I would not however seek another in my beer stash to put down tonight. Great brew!"
"The beer poured a light copper with a white head. The aroma was pretty much straightforward malt and hops. The taste started with malt and a bit of berry, which was then enveloped by the hops. The feel is medium and dry. Pretty impressive, a good deal of hops, but it is blended in well and gives you more than just bitter, count me in as a new fan."
"The beer smells of citrus and malt, is surprisingly sweet for an IIPA/Double IPA/ Imperial IPA. The middle is sweet and smooth, medium body and a nice layer of tiny bubbles to carbonate. The beer has a nice golden/amber color, especially visible in the recommended tulip wine glass. The body and head retention are medium-low. The finish was good, somewhat dry with lingering hops. Overall an excellent beer, though it was less hoppy than I remembered. It paired nicely with some homemade pesto."
"Overall: Very impressed, I liked this a lot. Would probably buy again. Not much else to say about it. Wish it was a 4 or a 6."
"Hand-delivered from the U.S. to Vienna (thanks, Jeff and Chris!), the bomber looks just like the picture. It pours a clear deep copper hue under a short-lived light beige one finger head that manages to generate some very impressive lace before fading to film and collar. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of citrus and flower, strong on the grapefruit but not ignoring the carnation, either. The mouth is slightly sticky and quite prickly, evidence of significant carbonation. The taste is all hops, predominantly citrus again. but with a significant espresso bitter hiding underneath. The citrus fades on the swallow, leaving the dry espresso bitter to dominate the finish and aftertaste, achingly urging another swig. There's plenty of alcohol here, which does not try to hide its influence. This is a bold and uncompromising drink, not for the faint of heart. Yum!"
"Bomber from Gary's in Madison, NJ. Burnt orange pour with a small but never ending head. HUGE hop aroma and a wonderful citrus and caramel flavor. One of the top 5 beers I had on my vacation on the east coast, and I am very happy to have learned fairly recently that I can pick up some Southern Tier if I'm willing to venture to Washington."
"The drinkability is excellent for a beer listed at 11% ABV. Overall, it seems that this DIPA, in attempt to avoid being unbalanced on the hop side of the equation, leans towards the malt backbone that dominates quickly into tasting. Not my favorite DIPA due to this, but still a delicious beer. Would be a good DIPA to introduce someone new to the style with."
"Overall, exceptional I2pa. This beer is currently one of my favorites of this style. All around a spectacular beer."
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"While I am enjoying this brew, I can't see myself running out to get another. I would consider picking this up again but just not at the top of my list."
" Find those."
"Super heavy hops in the aroma. Small fizzy head, super hoppy, a little flat carbonation wise. Tastes of soap as well. Enjoyable but it seems that 2IPAs are either hit or miss with me, this isn't one of the better ones that I've had."
"D: An impressive beer but the mix and focus was just not right for my personal taste. It goes down real easy. The trouble is that it is 11 ABV! An evening on this stuff would be a short evening indeed."
"D: I remember this tasting significantly better when I had it on draft awhile back, good enough to make this a solid A beer. If you can find it on draft near you, go for it. That said, this is still a decent DIPA. If you want a try a beer with some definite earthiness to it (usually hard to find), look no further than unearthly. Nice earthy/piney flavor, would have liked more bitterness. Alcohol is there, and lets you know it."
"taste is smooth, light grapefruit, caramel, citrus, well balanced hops and malt, somewhat sweet, ends bitter but not overpowering, the 11% alcohol is not apparent at all."
"Overall, this is a good wintery IPA, and is a great example of the heavier end of the spectrum of DIPA, but it is just missing that something that makes it great. I think it is slightly unbalanced on the side of the malts, but this is defenitely a hop driven beast. I think this would be a good one to introduce someone to how big an IPA can be, without laying a real prize on them. A good beer, but just cant quite keep up with the hop 15s, gluttonys, and vortex brews out there. All in all, an enjoyable brew."
"Great beer...I effin love Souther Tier's over-the-top-ness...they remind me of an east coast Stone."
"Update 9/10/08: Pours orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of sweet, chewy malt, crackers, light bitter hops, and perhaps some stale urine. Flavor is quite malty, with some iced tea. Light citrusy fruits start to emerge as the beer warms. This reminds me a lot of Stone 10th. Pretty tasty, but the flavor is a little off. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Pours a nice cloudy golden orange color with a thick foamy white head that settles into a lasting lacng. Aroma is dominated by earthy and citrus hops with hints of malt, pine and citus fruit. Very smooth drinking with a strong hoppy presence that lasts throughout. Hints of grapefruit and alcohol with a nice malty backbone. Excellent!."
"D- Stong, but balanced, and provides you with a nice hop fix."
"This beer pours a pale transparent orange with a huge creamy head. It had good lacing and retention. It has a very nice citrus hop aroma with a nice sweet malt background. There is a good floral, citrus hop taste with sufficient bitterness. There are some sweet caramel, candy, toffee, and slightly fruity flavors in there as well. It has a cool medium bodied feel and is slightly creamy. This beer is fairly drinkable. Much more than you would think from a DIPA and it goes down very smoothly."
"Cheers!!"
"D: Pretty jacked with my 3rd ST offering, these guys have got a great thing going and I'm a fan. Also, a great balanced brew for such a hoppy beast, a lot of credit is deserved for pulling that off. I forsee more ST brews in the near future!"
"D- Very drinkable, a very fun beer to drink, you'll never taste the 11%"
"The combination of balanced taste and smooth, seemingly alcohol free mouthfeel would make this beer a lethal combination for those that didn't read the bottle. This beer goes down like a smooth IPA of about 5.5 percent abv. Drinkability is excellent. This one is a winner!!"
"Bomber, from Forest City in CT. Pours dark orange with a small head and clingy lacing. Features a floral bouquet, complemented with some lemonade scent and sweetness. Upon hitting my lips, I felt very strongly that I was experiencing a cornucopia of hops. Lot of dry hopping involved I presume, given how intimate and """fresh""" all the estery, citrus flavors come together. With a smooth palate, Un*earthly just seduces you into an indulgence of citrus, grapefruit, and pine, all of which are perfectly balanced by sweeter malt and ripe orange. Finish lingers semi-sweet, and very fruity. Honestly, not a trace of the 11% alcohol, though I was buzzing after my final sip. Beautiful beer."
"Overall: not of this world"
"Drinkability: Fantastically smooth for such a high ABV. You really could fly through this - which is somewhat of a scare. Maybe not my favorite IIPA, but certainly up there with its own unique characteristics. Two thumbs way up."
"Drinkability: very tastey IPA with a great malt back bone."
"D- Not my absolute favorite beer, due to the lack of complexity, but drinkable enough. Would definitely give it another shot. For an over 10% DIPA, probably one of the biggest alcohol tastes I've encountered."
"another solid offering from Southern Tier at a fair and reasonable price."
"Cheers"
"Not my favorite. Okay sipped, but in general it is way too sweet and just not hoppy enough."
"Overall, pretty good for a IIPA. Well balanced between the malts and hops."
"Served in my DT tulip. Poured a translucent copper with copious tiny bubbles present in solution. Quarter in foamy head quickly dissipated into a bubbly/soapy skim. Virtually no lacing on this one. Nose is piney, caramel and sweet. Some citrus character, but subdued; no grapefruit here. Taste follows nose - malt is picked up in the mouth, followed by sweet and culminating in a slightly bitter/astringent finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly viscous, with a light carbonation burn detectable towards the back. Really easy drinking and tastey. I have to say that I'm not generally a fan of IPAs, but I am really starting to fall in love with DIPAs."
"Souther Tier's Unearthly is silky-soft, on the full side of medium-bodied, and damned near quaffable. I was surprised to find a brew sporting Chinook and Cascade in the boil, Styrian Goldings in the backing, and dry-hopped with C-hops a-go-go to be such a friendly, sweet and malty brew. Don't get me wrong, the beer is plenty hoppy, but I find I'm enjoying this maltier variation on the theme as much as any other of the monster hop-bombs endemic to the DIPA style. Thanks, again Lum!"
"D- Pretty nice! I love the big citrus nose on this. I wish I could get more!"
"Overall a very good beer - hoppy with enough malt to balance it without being cloying in the finish. Very drinkable for a high alcohol beer."
"D: Southern Tier delivers. 11% that drinks like half that. I'll leave it to the bottle to sum this one up: """To underestimate Unearthly is to trifle with the mysteries of the universe.""""
"D- Pretty drinkable...for 11%! Not my fav for the style but still a very nice offering."
"I enjoyed this."
"So sweet it's distracting. This is a dessert IPA. So much sweetness with a struggling malt profile. This was a titan of my first year of drinking. Time is a cruel mistress."
"This is an okay beer, not the greatest IPA, and certainly not the worst. In this world of beer were IPA's are seeminlgy ubiquitiuos this one chimes in as average"
"A huge thanks for Andy in NY for trading me this great beer. This poured in to my Duvel glass a very clear copper color with a nice solid and long lasting head that left great lacing on the glass. This was at 42 degrees as recommended on the bottle. Nose was very strong with lots of citrus, pine, and some fruit. Very rich and almost slick mouthfeel. Flavor is powerful and full of solid flavors that tend toward ripe fruits. Long bitter finish. This is a complex beer which might not please everyone but I like this kinds of brew. The alcohol is present but at 11 percent what can you expect. This is not the same as Pliny the Elder which I had a bottle of the night before, but in its own way is almost as good. Thanks Andy for a simply superb beer."
"This beer pours a nice light orange with a thin white head. The aroma is loaded with hops but balanced with some malty sweetness. It has a full body with solid bitterness to balance out the imperial maltiness. It finishes well and leaves you wanting more. Overall, a very good beer."
"I can't say anything bad about the mouthfeel and this is yet another outstandingly drinkable beer from Southern Tier. My only question is when can we expect to see distribution in VT? We're not too far away!"
"Deer copper orange with a thin white head. Aroma of grapefruit, caramel malt and pine. Oily at 1st hen there is a big hop bite and a dry finish. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable. Very good imperial. This is a complex beer which might not please everyone but I like this kinds of brew."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied beer that coats your mouth in brown sugar sweetness. The bitterness is strong but doesnt knock you out keeping this beer very drinkable. An exceppetn DIPA."
"Jk"
"An amber to golden color, with a two finger thick head, cream in color; dissolving away slowly, leaving a white lacing down the glass. A floral fragrance at the start, with a touch of grass and pine in the scent. There is a hint of malty sweetness at the end. The comes out out the start of the taste, then the hop onslaught begins. The hops bring on the flavors of pine, blending to a strong grapefruit and earthy flavors. A light to watery feel at the front, but it quickly gains weight to become a much more heavier feel. A strong Imperial IPA, with an incredible aroma, an intense flavor, that is never overwhelming. Throw this at some hot wings, some really hot wings, or some spicy pad thai."
"Drinkability - A little too hoppy and alcoholic to drink more than one, maybe two."
"Eh, I was expecting way more here. As it stands, this doesn't come close to Hoppe for me. I've got many more IIPAs to try before I come back to this one. If I know I'm getting it fresh, then maybe another try. Gets a few points for just being interesting, and worth examining again and again. It's boozy though, and probably one to split unless you have some time to spare. If I ever want something especially harsh and extreme, I know where to go."
"Excellently balanced DIPA in my opinion. Smooth and very drinkable."
"A good solid DPA"
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a fairly clear pale/orange with a large 1 inch white head. Smells of glorious hops just adds to my tastebud's anticipation. This puppy smells so nice I just have to sniff it a while. First sip is haven with an """In your face""" hop presence that begs and actually needs a huge malt backbone. The strong malts make this one quite a creamy treat. The super nice bitter finish is lovely. Well done."
"This is a really good beer. If you like hops...Drink it."
"Easily one of the most drinkable DIPA I've ever imbibed. Enough complexity to be interesting, but not overwhelmingly intense either. Nicely done."
"D: Drinks wonderfully for the ABV - very warming and smooth going down. Will buy again."
"D: great beer. i'll have again w/o doubt"
"The taste is hard to put my finger on because it is quite complex. Many different things are going on taste-wise, but it is incredibly balanced. A nice maltiness is right at the beginning, with a resiny hop taste. The tongue is left warm by the alcohol. Very smooth and perfectly carbonated. This beer is very easy to drink and is a bit better on the colder side (filled the glass twice with the bottle). Totally one worth trying."
"Cheers!"
"Drinks great for the style & ABV, nice DIPA!"
"Nice shade of orange with a good sized white/yellow tinted fluffy head that left some good splotchy patches of lace. The hop mix comes out smelling mostly of pine and sweet tropical citrus fruit. There is also plenty of a very sweet almost sugary malt smell. Taste is even better that I expected after smelling. It has a very good hop pressance off the top with some serious pine, sweet grapefruit and candied orange flavors, still if anything this is super ballanced with a huge does of malt for a DIPA, luckily for me its a very sweet malt but distinctively not carmel much more like light molassas/brown sugar flavor. The mouth feel is very thick but also oily and creamy making an excellent over all impression passing through. Overall very nicely done but possibly a little to ballanced."
"The nose on the beer is filled with cascade hops with some hints of citrus; a bit of caramel comes through as well. When the beer is poured I almost get a peachy hop character to it. The beer is poured with a decent finger head and a nice copper/orange colour. It also has a bit of carbonation. The flavours in the beer are very subtle because of the such strong alcohol and hop character, I get a bit of caramel, citrus, and some subtle piny flavours. There definitely is a huge bitterness that follows, but the beer isn't as overwhelming as I expected. The hops are very tasty though. Creamy with a bit of a bite from the carbonation, and pretty damn drinkable for a 11% beer."
"Of note: The first time I tried this beer, I didn't like it at all. It's amazing what a year's worth of trying new beers and pushing your palate will do."
"Drinkability is not so high here because of the 11% abv it's a bit too warm ."
"mouthfeel is oily, bitter, creamy, slightly hot in the finish, very good - i wouldn't drink multiple bottles in a sitting, but i like variation :D"
"Drinkability - absolutely delicious."
"Drinkability: For the ABV, this is an incredibly drinkable beer. The alcohol makes very little appearance in the taste, save for a subtle warmth on the back end. I started out with this beer a bit cold, and it lacked much of the depth it showed as the temperature rose. The complex malt characteristics began to show through more as the beer got warmer. For the style, this is a great beer, although I think it would be interesting to see some heavier malt overtones brought into this beer. I think the hops could stand up to some toastier, sweeter, darker malts."
"HV"
"Pours an extremely clear copper color, with a sizeable white head of very small bubbles. Aroma is a truckload of Cascade hops, like smelling a handful of pellets on brew day. There's a heavy note of sweet citrus (oranges, mostly), and a pungent grassiness as well. In the taste, the hops are more peppery/earthy/vegetal; aside from the slight caramel flavor, this beer is very dry in the mouth. For a big IPA, the malt is very impressive, as it plays a supporting role while still being very interesting in its own right. The red wheat definitely comes through with a sharp tartness in the finish. The alcohol level in this beer is near-invisible, and if I didn't know any better, I'd guess it was maybe 7%ABV. This beer definitely sets itself apart in a very crowded category."
"D: Excellent DIPA. Great flavor and goes down smooth, but the high ABV catches up to you quick. Another great beer from ST."
"D: A 10oz snifter is plenty. So damn good, though."
"While this is only my second Southern Tier brew, they are quickly jumping to the forefront in my preferences. A nice brewery with some good offerings."
"Medium body nice balance, definitely one of the top Imperial IPAs around. WOW undescribable."
"D-Very easy to drink almost would say someone could take this one on thats note a big IPA fan, or starting out with them."
"D: No doubt this beer packs a wallop, and with the 11% alcohol def a sipping a beer. with that said i like my Imperial IPAs to be a little easier drinking than this one. It reminded me more of a barley wine than an imperial IPA"
"D: For such a high abv. this is quite drinkable."
"Notes: Received from Dyan in a recent trade; thanks!"
"D: No doubt this beer packs a wallop, and it'll almost certainly tire out my taste buds. not much use switching to another beer afterwards either since next to this it'll taste like water."
"D: Amazing. Well worth a try, and repeat, over and over."
"Unearthly has a deep straw color, and is very clear. The head is thick, frothy and stays at two fingers deep for a nice duration. Not too much aroma, but you can detect a sweet, double ipa smell through the cloudy yellow foam. Deep malty feel, and hoppy notes, but mostly malt. 11% is there, but is nicely covered by complex malt character. A great imperial IPA, but could deal with being a bit more crisp, but how refreshing should something teetering above 10% be really? Great beer."
"D: I liked this beer, but it's not one that completely knocked my socks off. Still, it's a great balanced DIPA, glad I tried it finally."
"D: Too much flavor and hoppiness to have a lot of, but one or two are really nice."
"D-Just a great beer. Very drinkable. Not an everyday beer, but a great balance of hops and malt."
"d- great beer, but being 11% this is one brew that I have to pace myself on. Its a very nice treat."
" I found this one a bit hard to drink simply becuase of the sharp bitter hops and high boozy heat. The malt balance is nice though."
"D: Overall I enjoyed it and would probably try it again."
"Honey amber with a white sudsy lacing head head. Smell is heavy of smoke and hops. The taste is bitter but sweet making for a pleasant hoppy taste with a spicy finish. The mouthfeel is oily and thick, the alcohol becomes more noticeable the more you sip it. All and all it is very drinkable, no wonder it's one of the top ipas"
"On tap at Shango Bistro. Clear amber with no head. The head must have faded by the time the pint arrived. Sweet, fruity aroma. Syrupy with a nutty flavor and some pine. 153 IBUs? I'm looking for some spicy hops somewhere but I'm having a hard time finding them. I think this would be a much better beer if they toned things down a bit."
"Holy shit! Smell equals sterilization; pure hops! This beer is quite a bit like Stone's Ruination. However, unlike the Ruination, as hopy as this beer smells and tastes, It is certainly well balanced with a range of spices, and isn't offensive to any part of the pallet, including the back of the tongue; it is very even. This beer is good from sip one and thus has little room to get better as you drink; it doesn't """grow""" on you. Watch-out scout, there's plenty of EtOH."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a clear, golden, orange with 2 cm off white foamy head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma is citrusy and floral hops. Initial flavor is sweet but short lived. Overwhelming hops dominate the flavor with a touch of spice on the backend, very dry. Aftertaste is long lived. Light carbonation, medium body, moderate to extensive lacing, and obvious presence of alcohol. Overall a very good beer and even better on tap."
"Drinkability- A bomber is tough to do, unless you have a real sweet tooth. It's very good and quite different from many extreme abv DIPA's. Keep it in the fridge if you can't fit the entire bottle in a glass."
"D - Way too drinkable for an 11 ABV beer! Seriously, one has to be careful!"
"Enjoying this one even more on the second go round."
"Great beer and for a 5.99 price tag, how could you go wrong. Seek this one out."
""""to underestimate unearthly is to trifle with the mysteries of the universe...""" Badass stuff! So tasty, so well balanced and so dangerous. It's VERY easy to forget this stuff is 11 percent abv. I would say this beer is among peers when compared to Hopslam or Big A IPA. Great stuff."
"pours a nice crystal clear golden color with a white head that recedes to a thin lace. the aroma is a beautiful arrangement of hops and fruit esters balanced out nicely over a background of malt. the taste follows suite with a nice bit of the malt up front and the fruity hoppy follow through with a good hop bite at the end. the mouthfeel is a little thinner than the other double ipa's I've had this afternoon, but still very nice with good bit of carbonation."
"The guys at Southern Tier continue to prove that they know what they are doing as this is yet another winner."
"D: Very hoppy but very drinkable as well. A big drinking 2x with loads of hops and flavor and you would never guess its 11%abv."
"D- At 22 oz. with 11% alcohol and the sheer amount of hops in this beer i would say this a one and done deal. Anymore than one of these in a day and it would be bed time for me. On sheer taste it needs more balance the hops are a bit on the dominate side for me."
"Thank you Lee for having bottles of this on hand during my trip to VA. I cannot get Southern Tier down here in H-E-double-L so was very excited to try. So it was after a couple long days at the VA brewfest that this brew turned out to be my favorite I tried. Delicious balanced Dipa. So delicious. so so delicious. I can't say anymore because I was not up to writing down beer notes while drinking, but I will say ending a night on this beer is a sure way to wake up contorted in an armchair while your friends are making fun of your displays of sleep apnea."
"Sickning good, I think I'll have 4 pints."
"Dangerously smooth for it's 11% ABV. So far I've liked what I've had from Southern Tier. I actually started out the night with their IPA. But that's another review..."
"Glad to have Southern Tier on board in Missouri. A very good example of the DIPA style."
"It is a little pricey, but I don't regret the purchase one bit. I will likely buy again."
"Poured a copperesque body with a rocky foam head that died quickly. Intense hop smell that was expected hit me, along with some husky malts that are tucked in there. An intense hop taste but also a tad sweet from some caramel/honey and not just citric fruit from the hops but some sweet fruits as well (pineapple?). Without a doubt one of the smoothest and full-bodied DIPA's I've ever had, this went past the tongue without drying it out or killing my tastebuds. Only the ABV stops this from being a session beer (and I must note they hid that well)."
"D-As most hop bombs focus on frying your taste buds, this is a marvelously crafted brew with attention paid to both the hops and the malt. Clearly with 11% abv it isn't your every night beer, but it is a fine example of the, often overdone, style."
"Taste is sweet and heavy on the malt. A strong caramel malt taste that balances the strong bitterness supplied by the American hops, Chinook, Cascade and Centennial. The yeast adds a red fruity taste of cherries and blackberries. Also some cinnamon association. My mouth is starting to numb of the strong bitterness (153 IBU). A nice balance between malt and hops, although bitterness is a little too much for me."
"This beer pours a beautiful amber with a white head. The smell of this beer got be VERY excited. I poured the beer and was suprised by the amount of carbonation in it. The taste was delicious.... borderline 5 if not for the over carbonation imo. The mouth feel is not the greatest with the high carbonation but the taste certainly makes it worthwhile to drink. BTW it is a very easy 11% beer. This would be a nice started for an evening doubt its something that could be drank all night"
"Drinkability is excellent, especially given the style."
"D - """Danger, Will Robinson!""" At 11% ABV, one will do so the drinkability suffers. I WILL (no pun intended) buy this again and share with sober friends. Probably a better drink for the fall and winter."
"Poured from a bottle into two pint glasses that were split between me and my dad on the holiest of holy days; Father's Day. Pours a light orange with minimal lacing. Has a very earthy, hoppy aroma. Taste is similar to smell, hoppy, earthy, with some citrus. This is pretty well-balanced between the hops and the malt. A very drinkable IPA from Southern Tier."
"There's a lot of good stuff going into this beer, and a lot of good things come out as a result - the hop flavors and aromas, for one, are really great. The downside of brewing any beer like this, though, is that there's plenty of stuff that can go wrong, and it seems like there are still a few kinks that need to be worked out before this becomes a truly great DIPA."
"D- Very drinkable brew great balance."
"This was a very good beer. I absolutely love the sweet kick after the onslaught of hops. It just makes for a great combination of flavors that leaves me wanting more after each sip. It isn't quite as good as Dreadnaught or the like, but it was also about half the price. If I get the chance again, I would certainly get a couple bombers."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer all things considered ABV wise and IBU wise. A good beer but one that I am not going to remember as being mind blowing in the long run."
"Taste well!"
"This stuff grabs hold right away and you begin to realize it'll take awhile to get through the bomber. A great sipper and showcase of the style with a toasty side that holds its own."
"D= For an IPA with barleywine strength, this is a dangerously drinkable beer. I would have liked the alcohol aromas toned down a bit and the hop aromas amped up a bit, but this is still an outstanding beer that I will certainly have again!"
"Southern Tier just never lets up. This is right up there with Ruination for me."
"For such a high ABV this beer is incredibly drinkable. Nuff said! Drink up and enjoy this one on a hot day, on a cold day, on any day!"
"D- A very good beer, just have to watch the alcohol content."
"Excellent beer! Can't beleive it is 11%, but I do enjoy the kick! One of my favs!"
"Pours a beautiful clear copper with a good fluffy head. Fed by good carbonation. Smells of pungent pine and grapefruit. Foam settles to a nice little head. Slight malt candy sweetness similar to Avery's Maharaji (goosebumps) Silky mouth feel. Really well balanced, good caramel malts back up the onslaught of the hops that were previously mentioned. Great finish, tongue tingling hops. Hides the 11% very well. Highly recommended."
"D: It's a very good DIPA/IIPA, but not something you could drink any other way than slowly sipping. Some high gravity beers can sneak up on you ... not this one."
"Serving Type- Bottle"
"M/D - An unusual IPA. Delicate taste, not sure that's the best for the style. On the sweeter side. Guess this is my way of saying that I enjoyed the creativity within this beer but it loses something in these qualities."
"Nice beer if you happen to like having your tastebuds temporarily destroyed. Being the IPA-lover (and therefore masochist) that I am, I actually do like it. This isn't a beer that I'd have every day, but then again, what Double IPA is? This beer is over-the-top in almost every way, exactly like a good Double IPA should be. For that I applaud it. I will definitely be revisiting it at some point in the future when I need a serious hop fix. Recommended, but only for lovers of the style."
"overall, an excellent example of the style, one of my favorite DIPA's, definitely worth trying."
"A tall glass of """fuck you""" from a bottle. Furthermore, at 11% and 650 mls, this is like drinking a whole bottle of wine. A new session brew? Good."
"A great beer for hop heads. I will be getting more of this. Very simple, no frills IIPA with good punch."
"Southern Tier just keeps impressing me more and more with their line."
"This beer pours a hazy pale orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into a think cap of lacing. The aroma is of full of grapefruit, and pine resin with enough malt in the background to make it interesting. The taste is quite balanced. There is a lot of malt up front with a firm bitterness in the finish, and a lingering sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice DIPA that I would drink again."
"I bought the bottle through archer liquors online. I would buy this again and I wished southern tier would make it to texas."
"D - This is a pretty good Imperial IPA. I expected better, but it was still good."
"D- pretty damn sweet"
"Overall- The sweetness makes this 1 a bit cloying but otherwise an excellent sipper!"
"Mouthfeel is big even and viscous. Heavy handed ABV make this a bit harder to handle than some other DIPAs on the other end of the scale. That said this is a nice DIPA (or Barleywine?)."
"22oz. bomber served in a Duvel glass. Poured a clear gold with about a finger of white head. Big citrus hop aroma with a good amount of sweet malt. Plenty of hop bitterness but not a mouth puckering dryness. Nice malt backbone. Good balance makes it dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Solid beer."
"D: This is a very drinkable DIPA with a definite sweetness to balance the citrus hops. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavors are easy to consume, but a bit of a bore for an IPA. I don't think I want to drink more than this bomber, probably not even the whole thing. Think I'll go find someone to share it with."
"I dunno. I just don't like it."
"Holy cow, this beer packs a real punch! Good head for the high alcohol content and left decent lacing down the glass. Huge hoppy aroma and flavors up front with hints of citrus, pine, sweet, bready malts, candied fruits. Delicious taste throughout. One of the best tasting DIPA's out there. It was quite carbonated but the body of this brew is thick and syrupy that coated the mouth. Super smooth, great flavor. Nice brew!!"
"Drank this one with nasty15108. Poured this one from a bomber into a mouthwash sized plastic cup(not the ideal situation for a tasting but it sure was good). Poured clear reddish brown with a decent off white head. As far as the lacing goes, plastic makes it a little tough to judge. The smell was huge filling the car as soon as it was opened(thats right I said the car). Big time piney spice smell that faded into what could best be described as old cheese although strangely not in a bad way. Delicious hop explosion right off the first sip followed by a slightly soapy taste(again not in a bad way) finishing up with a very mild smooth alcohol warmth. Definite hop oil mouthfeel coating the mouth and leaving that hopspice all over the tongue Very well balanced and unassuming for an 11% ABV. Glad I tasted this one with a buddy because a few of the smells and flavors I couldn't place came too while drinking and giving our opinions. Definitely give this one a shot."
"I've brewed my own double IPA and that was not cheap to do, so its a justifiable price to pay."
"MF&D - Full bodied and slightly syrupy. It left a nice oily hop mouth feel. Definitly does not feel like 11% ABV. I recommend trying this one."
"Pours a clear amber color with about an inch of foamy eggshell colored head, nice lasting retention leaves some good sticky lacing. Smells of caramel, honey, biscuit, pine, citrus, and floral hops. Tastes of grapefruit and peppermint up front with a nice solid caramel and biscuity malt backbone and a good spruce finish with alcohol warmth. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth, sticky, sweet, and bitter with noticeable alcohol that comes out more as the beer warms up and becomes medicinal. A solid and flavorful DIPA, but the high alcohol content and how strongly it comes out makes this a beer I wouldn't want very often, and would definitely have to split it with someone."
"Overall, this is one outrageously good and well balanced IIPA. Quite possibly one of the best I've ever had. Any fan of the style should definitely seek this one out. I'd happily buy this again for the $6.80 that I paid for it. I had a very hard time not giving this a five on more than a single category. This is damn near perfect, and I think it would be absolutely amazing on cask. Either way, this makes me very happy that Southern Tier is now available in Virginia. I will be buying more of their stuff. Very highly recommended!!!"
"This is a good effort from Southern Tier but I can't help but wonder what this would be like with the heat turned down a little more? I dug the aroma and flavor profile but medicinal tasting DIPAs just aren't my thing and it definitely hurt the drinkibility some what for me."
"Overall a very nice IIPA. Not the best in the world, but definitely memorable. I'd pick it up again."
"Pretty to look at, and despite some notes, lacking in offensiveness... I prefer the Hoppe to this, and in a way, it reminds me of the Back Burner. A nice start, and perfectly adequate (probably better local and fresh), but in need of refinement."
"This poured a clear, dark amber with off-white head. It smelled like a mix of potent floral and pine hops, with no noticeable malt. It tasted somewhat similar to Hoppe but with more powerful orange hops, still with the same caramel malt, well balanced but not very complex. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty and full flavored beer, but was fairly basic (certainly not as unique as Hoppe)."
"Overall, Let this one sit in the glass and warm up to bring out the aromas. Big beer with big taste, drink this one at the end of the night."
"On to the ÜberSun"
"A different take on the DIPA than the West Coast versions I am use to. The alcohol makes it a sipper and after I finished the bomber I was feeling the effects."
"This nice IPA pours a clear amber and displays a big fluffy off-white head with chunky lacing throughout. The nose picks up pleanty of malt and pine hops, very enticing. The tongue enjoys plenty of sweet pine hops, an oily thick mouthfeel with oat malt flavor swimming all around. It brings a decent alcohol presence. It's smooth and reasonably strong but makes itself easy to drink none the less. Another Southern Tier success!"
"Pours an amber color with a nice white head, fair retention, some nice lace clings to the glass. Aroma is strong of citrus and piney hops. Taste has a nice malty sweetness upfront eventually giving way to to some sharp citrusy hop bitterness. Medium to full mouthfeel, a touch lighter than some IIPAs. Definitely an easy drinker for 11% ABV. Very good IIPA. Glad to see Southern TGier in St. Louis. If all of there beers are this good I cant wait to try them."
"Very good beer, very well balanced."
"Mouthfeel has a solid medium body. Mildly sticky on the palate and juicy in texture. A very nice sipper indeed!"
"D: This one is a little 'stiffer' the Hoppe brand from the brewery, but it's still quite an easy drinker. The ABV starts to make itself known towards the end of the glass (esp. following the Hoppe). Sip the night away with it... quite a great way to spend the evening."
"Let Go Red Sox ."
"Drinkable? Hell yes! If you haven't had one, I recommend you go out and find one."
"D: For a hop lover, it's incredibly drinkable for its strength."
"Unearthly can hold its own with the West Coast hop bombs I love so dear. The color was remarkable thin looking for a beer so high in ABV. And the ABV is VERY well masked. I drank the whole bomber in about an hour and definitely knew it."
"Unearthly is very good. My first encounter with Southern Tier & if this is an example of the goods, I'm going to be stocking up when they arrive in the Twin Cities."
"Pours a bright orange with an initially huge, then compact white head that leaves a sheets of lacing. The aroma just leaps at you, and is wonderfully complex. Grapefruit, bread, caramel, grain...its all in there. The initial taste is a bit sweeter than I expected, with a slight honey aspect. Floral and citrus hops appear in the middle, but seem more no more abundant than in the standard IPA - perhaps they are subdued by the malt. The mix of flavours makes the aftertaste pleasant, with the alcohol only peeking out from behind a curtain of resin and malt. The mouthfeel is medium-thick, and almost oily, with medium-light carbonation. The high alcohol content precludes this from being a beer you could drink two of in an evening, but its definitely one that you would want to revisit."
"The full head provides this DIPA a nice creamy mouthfeel. The most surprising thing about this beer is the fact that everyone I drank this with was unable to guess it's high ABV%. The 11% is very well hidden, but makes this beer even more dangerous. A deliciously hoppy beer that goes down so easily and quickly."
"D- A good beer, but not a regular drinker. It'll put you on your butt."
"Pours a very clear orange color with a small creamy white head on it. It left patchy lacing on the walls of my pint glass. I get a good whiff of this as I pour it. Dominant scents include sticky pine, ripe citrus fruit, and subtle earthiness. I also get some lesser scents including bready malt and an underlying honey sweetness smell. The taste is of very sweet honey-like malt and bitter hops. There is a bit of a caramel undertone to this beer as well. The hops seem a bit subdued and do not have the quality on the palate as they do in the nose. The mouthfeel is medium and the alcohol is very well hidden. The drinkability did not hold well for me on this beer. It was very sweet and I suspect underattenuation on this beer. That would explain a nice body and mouthfeel and an overall sweet taste."
"I've never had a Southern Tier that I didn't like, and I do like this one, it definitely has it's own distinguishing qualities."
"Drinkability: An exceptional version of the style, in a more graceful and nuanced way than a lot of them turn out to be (one of my favorites recently being Moylan's Hopsickle, with has a less ABV% but has much more of a visceral nature for the hophead), and it seems like that's their purpose. These ST bombers can get expensive, but this one's certainly worth it, and I'd undoubtedly try it again, and if you have to choose either the Hoppe or this, choose the latter. Still, this beer has let me know that Southern Tier can do their thing, and I'll be trying more when I get the chance, hoping that they can match my experience with this."
"I'd stay this one is on the lighter side of a DIPA. Some of the heavier ones usually mirror a barley wine. I'd say the %ABV puts it in the DIPA category though. It's enjoyable, and still drinkable, so drink this one out of a pint glass rather than a snifter. Recommended."
"Anyway... this a world class beer across the boards. Loved it! Thanks again Tony!"
"D: Well balanced and almost non-detectable alcohol level. Easily enjoyed 22oz bomber."
"Hee Hee."
"Pours a slightly transluscent orange color with a bit of haze. Smell is a citrusy hops mainly. Taste is sweet citrus and orange for a second before drying out, leaving a dry lingering clean grapefruity flavory. Mildly bitter. Very nice clean DIPA, and probably my favorite Southern Tier beer. Well hidden alcohol as well for 11%."
"The more I drink, the more I want this beer. A very well moderated hop showcase, this beer is a great version of the style, with everything to love about an imperial IPA and very little of the overbearing intensity in some other IIPAs. Only drawback is the extremely well hidden 11%abv."
"Overall, A very good beer, my sample seems more like an IPA than it's Imperial relative, but still quite enjoyable. Couldn't drink too many with 11% ABV, especially out of a bomber, but I will surely try this one again sometime."
"The taste has a slight bite of alcohol accompanied by pine and citrus notes. There is a slight bit of caramel sweetness too. The mouthfeel is a crisp and light one, but, with a full bodied flavor. Excellent brew."
" This is a sipper"
"Its high abv makes this a sipper. Still, assuming you're not driving, one you could enjoy for a good three rounds. Personally, it is one of the top 3-4 IPA's of any interpretation I've every had and one I will actively revisit."
"Came in a nice chalice. Nice looking golden hazy copper hue with a small but thick off-white head that faded to a persistent halo. Nose is chock full 'o hops. Intense layers of hops. Taste is piney hops with sweet citrus kicks and more hops. I like the hop intensity in the nose, but the flavor is a tad bit overdone, although balanced nicely with sweetness and a bitter ending. Couldn't feel or taste the alcohol at all through that hop attack. Great mouthfeel. Thick IPA goodness. Overall a very nice IPA."
"Unearthly poured a clear honey amber that had a 1 inch head of creamy white foam. This creamy foam had really good retention that left behind a small white film and quite a few thick streaks of creamy white lace. It had a big time powerful aroma of sour grapefruit, fresh pine, citrus hops, citrus fruits, more pine, and then it ended with more sour grapefruit. The taste was just as powerful as the aroma. That means the taste was just filled with pine, sour grapefruit, citrus fruits, a pinch of earth, and then the taste ends with powerful citrus hops that tasted like the hops unleashed a wolverine sized aggresiveness of hops on your tongue. If you couldn't tell already, it was a full bodied beer that had a long lasting aftertaste of pine, grapefruit, citrus hops, and citus fruits. Where was the strong ABV of 11%? If it was in there, I couldn't feel it and it was probably covered up by all the citrus flavors and pine that were in here. Overall, Unearthly was noting short of a great hoppy beer. I was happy that I got to try this hoppy winner on tap. Just be a litte careful with this one because it will sneak up on you."
"22 oz. bomber brewed with 2-row, carapils, and red wheat. It's boiled with Chinook and Cascade, sent through the hopback with Styrian Goldings, then dry-hopped with Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. The hop bill listed on my bottle doesn't match the one online, so either mine is an old version, or they haven't updated the site yet; the recipe on the internet lists this brew as 153 IBUs, and the bottle suggests it be served at 42 degrees, but I sampled it warmer than that. The beer is a nice, lightly-hazed orangey/amber, with low carbonation and three fingers of tan head that leaves some nice lace. Lots of hop oils in the nose, with juicy citrus (candied orange, grapefruit), sea salt, pale malt and just a hint of wheat. It has a very malty, thick, lightly sweet body with strong citric grapefruit, a medium/high bitterness and a suggestion of tartness. Smooth, dry, and lightly numbing on the palate, with low carbonation and a lingering finish. Overall, this is a nice, big-ass IPA, but the outlandish IBU claim isn't perceived as such, and it's just a touch too sweet for the style."
"For anyone is trying to get a friend or girlfriend into IPAs and have been scared away by say...a bittering experience, try sharing one of these. The perfect combination of floral, bittering, aroma, in a showcasing of Hops that is presented beautifully, well balanced and tame but not lame. Cheers!"
"A great beer and an excellent use of hops. Go for it."
"overall: I think this bottle is showing some age, as I'm not getting the huge hops I expected, mostly a """sticky""" citric sweetness and hot alcohol and bitterness in the finish. Quite two-dimensional and not very complex, just booze and hop bitterness. I'm a little disappointed with this beer."
"Good body with a light to mid feel. Surprisingly smooth and a nice feel being at 11%. Really impressive as flavor doesn't have any real off flavors. Overall I am impressed with the brewing but the hops are a bit underbalanced for me."
"One of the best Southern Tier brews I've sampled... A must for all hop-heads and definitely recommended..."
"d-- 1 bomber is not enough I like it/ not the most amazing beer, but it is good. the 11% is well hidden"
"D: Great, one of the most well balanced DIPA's i have had. With the high alcohol would only be able to have one or two."
"A carbonated honey amber colored body has active bubbles on the body leading up to a rocky two finger light tan head. Leaves scattered lace as it slowly fades. Nose is blasting with citrus and woodsy piney hop character wraped up with a noticeable hot alchol presence. The first sip brings well balanced hops rolling over the tongue to create a creamy feel that is amazingly smooth. A high level of complexity is shown on the palate with nice malt balanced richness, and hop created sweetness. There is a steady bitter feel but it is welcomed and warm with just a touch of alchol which is amazing considering its 11% alchol. As I continue to drink I continue to love this beers balanced sweetness, richness and bitter feel. This is an awsome achievement of craft beer. Drinkability is of the chart for this level of alchol. Mouthfeel is slightly thick and full of desire. A very very good brew. Goes great with Danish blue cheese."
"Poured from tap at Chappy's Tap Room in Moraine, OH. Brown amber color with a nice 2 finger head. The hoppy smell was very nice. The taste was dirty like grass or pine hops with some liquorish or toffee on the malt side. It seemed a bit unbalanced with the hops much more prevelant than the malts. It had a very nice lacing and overall was a very nice beer."
"D-Way to easy to drink. This brew is dangerously good."
"Excellent IIPA. This one may overtake my 2nd place prize (currently given to Avery's Maharaja). I must have MORE!!!!"
"This was another take out from the Headkeeper. I tried the Southern Tier Pumking this past fall and fell in love with it, so I figured this Imperial IPA. was worth a shot. I grabbed my crystal snifter and favorite bottle opener with gusto. The beer poured with a wonderful inch thick head. The color was a beautiful deep golden, with a minimal amount of lacing. The aroma of hops and citrus hit me immediately as I took the initial breath. The taste was bitter for an IPA. but also very mellow. This beer boasts an 11% ABV but you wouldn't know it by the taste...it is very well hidden. This is a wonderful example of what an Imperial IPA should be."
"Pours a crisp orange with a frothy off-white head that lasts and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is floral citrus hops with some fruity sweet malts. The taste is loads of bitter citrus hops with light caramel and sweet malts right behind for a decent balance. The beer is on the heavy side of medium and has the feel of a lower alcohol beer, this is one to be careful with."
"This was really well balanced. Especially considering it weighs in at 153 IBU's! Well worth seeking out."
"Medium bodied, prickles and tingles the tongue with all the spicy hops. Creamy and a bit sticky. Unreal drinkability - I drained the bomber in no time, despite the sadistic hop assault. Not the best Double IPA, but damn good."
"Better than Gemini in my opinion, which is half this brew and half Hoppe, not my favorite double IPA out there but still pretty good, a little on the sweet side with excess malt, would drink again if I ever crossed paths with it again, recommended"
"D = Good drinkability. Strong enough and bitter enough that one will do it at a time, but I can definitely see picking this when in the mood for a DIPA."
"Together with a ridiculously creamy mouthfeel, this just became one of my favorite double IPAs of all time, if not my favorite. It's so insanely delicious that it's easy to forget how big it is. As the label warns: """To underestimate Unearthly is to trifle with the mysteries of the universe, so please consume wisely.""" ie. this is so drinkable as to make fools of otherwise responsible beer enthusiasts. So I don't rate the drinkability anything other than """good", because this is clearly a special-occasion sipper. That's no complaint. This is truly exceptional."
"D - I felt like this is kinda of an average DIPA in my opinion. It seems a bit unbalanced to me too which means that I wouldn't be crazy to try to get another one. I think this is a a beer that I wouldn't go out of my way to get and would pass over as well compared to other DIPAs."
"Bottom line: After I pretty much finished with the text in my review, I took a peak at some other reviews and most of them seem to say that the hops in Unearthly have a bigger presence than the malt. I respectfully, disagree. Either way, this is one of the best of the style that I've tasted ever. Worth sekking out? You darn tootin!"
"The body was medium, a little lighter than I would have guessed for a DIPA but thats alright. Great beer all around."
"D- Overall, I was surprisingly disappointed. I didn't know this was a double IPA until I started drinking it and re-read the label. For a double, imo, it's actually weaker than I like in terms of hop bitterness and overall flavor- for my double ipas I prefer much sharper/whip crack bitterness from the hops, lingering far after the initial flavor, which this didn't do. While very smooth and likely to be drinkable with many foods, it didn't strike me as a double IPA that I'll return to just to drink on its own. The alcohol doesn't show thru, which I suppose is a plus, but overall, that doesn't lift the beer to great heights."
"The amazing thing about this beer is its ability to hide a whopping ABV. I got nothing of it in the aroma and very little in the taste. A great display of craftsmanship."
"The mouth is smooth, soft, full, and creamy, faint carbonation, and the slightest bit of warmth is all you'll notice from the 11% ABV. Its a sipper, but one you'll be able to sip for more than one bottle. A superbly crafted beer, wonderful to drink. Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for supplying me with this."
"Uh huh shucks-a-roony, this heah, beah be pretta dahmn good. Pours with some lasting head and a bit o lace. medium amber color. Almost a kind of nutty/hoppy fragrance. I personally don't pick up any alcohol characteristics, but friends sampling with me do. A very well balanced xtra IPA. Long hoppy, but not overly bitter finish. If not for the juice, maybe a session beer."
"Recommended. Not the best DIPA out there, but one that I wouldn't mind coming back to."
"Cheers"
"Poured from 22 oz. into mug. Deep, dark caramel/orange zest or burnt orange color. Concentrated head that dissipates just a little too easy. Aroma is solid, flowery hop character - would expect maybe a little more for something as powerful as this. Woven into the huge hop flavor is a nice, sweet balance of butterscotch/toffee. Strong finish - a little syrupy but not too long backed by the bitterness of the hops. Good to savor in cold weather."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is one hefty but sweet and balanced east coast DIPA, the 11% abv hampers the drinkability, but I completely enjoyed all 22oz in one sitting, I was blown away by Choklat in NYC and Unearthly does not disappoint, I am looking forward to sampling more of these big beers from Southern Tier!"
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. Just respect the 11 percent ABV. It will bite back. Overall a great beer. Southern Tier proves an East Coast brewery can make a mean Imperial IPA."
"Nice nose, full of cascade hops, also some sweet malt in there too. Taste is similar, definately not too bitter but has some nice hop flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly full, nice healthy dose of carbonation keeps it from being heavy. Drinkability is very good considering the 11% ABV. I would have gladly had another."
"D:Man I love this DIPA baby. It is friggin great."
"Pours amber with a short head that fades to a very thin cap. Some slight lacing. I'm not too worried about thin heads in an 11% double IPA, though. Smells of honeyed malt with a good dose of citrusy and floral hops- delicate and flower-like. Well balanced with the ample malt there in a supporting role for the very fresh smelling hops. The taste is absolutely beautiful. A very slightly floral sweetness begins the flavor parade, which then gently merges into a complex citrusy and floral hop bitterness with a nice touch of pine on the finish. These hop flavors become more herbal as the beer warms and opens up. This is one fresh tasting beer!. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and quite soft. Amazingly integrated and drinks well below the 11% abv. Deliciously drinkable despite the high alcohol. Like many great beers, this is complex and changes a good bit in the glass. The substantial malt balances the complex hop flavors well while preserving the purity of the hops. Beautifully clean and vibrant."
"D- Very drinkable for 11 percent, I would have thought the alcohol was somewhere around 7."
"This is an excellent double IPA from Southern Tier. It pours a shinny copper color and its aroma is a mix of pine and citrus. The taste isnt diffidently different. There is a bit of malt with a mix of bitterness and sweetness, but not the big hoppy bite that I was expecting. The feel of the beer going down is different as well. Its very creamy and thick. The taste sticks to your tongue after you drink it down. You can taste alcohol, but its not overwhelming. Overall a very balanced beer with a very different taste and feel."
"D - Definitely drinks like a DIPA. Big, bold and hoppy with a considerable ABV% and good amount of heat. Very drinkable, even for a DIPA."
"Happy drinking!"
"Pours a fogged copper with a creme head. Resin nose with firm pine tones. Flavor is definitely for the hop heads. Thick and well balanced piney hops. Feel is balanced and good. Very drinkable. But keep in mind that you better love the hops if you are going to dance with this one."
"These guys just got distribution in Virginia, and oh boy, thank the booze gods for our opportunity to quaff Southern Tiers masterful brews. Unearthly is a hella good IIPA. Let's start with that. Why? Let's continue. Out of bomber (nice silkscreen label, by the way) and into an awaiting glass of proper proportions. Marvelous honeyed hue with bountiful puffy head. Mmmmm, resinous lacing soon follows. Aroma is a little muted, but definitely leans on the """sticky""" side as far as bouquet goes. Flavor is where it is at. Certainly this is a sweeter interpretation, but that is not a fault. Amazingly smooth with rich, plump malt just swirling beneath a foil of juniper, grapefruit, tree sap alpha acids. And drinkablility? Whooo-eeee! This sucka's not unlike a Lay's potato chip. Unfortunately, at 11%, more than a bomber or two (honestly I could do three) and words get a little gummy in your mouth. End result- thank you Southern Tier for giving me one more thing to blame for doing stupid things at a party."
"Not a lot of difference between the bottled and draft versions. Nice amount of head and good lacing. Aroma is typical of a DIPA. But he taste is out of this world. If you love DIPAs like I do and havent tried this one do yourself a favor and get this. You WILL NOT be disappointed. This beer lives up to its hype."
"I'm not sure which side of the fence I stand on with this beer. At 11% ABV, the high alcohol is there, pronouncing its """imperial""" status. But the booziness of it doesn't really detract too much from the overall experience. Ultimately, however, for me this is just too sweet for an IPA of any kind. For fans of the style, I would recommend giving it a try. But in my opinion there are better representatives on the shelf."
"CHEERS!"
"Had another fresh bottle. I have come to realize that this beer is much more enjoyable from tap. In bottle form the sweetness really seems to pop more than tap, making the drinkability suffer a bit. As I said in the first part of my review, the end of the bomber the sweetness starts to wear. Still a great beer, just not a super guzzler. I think I need to move my tap review to be separate."
"Sort of an deeper honey color with a white fluffy head. Aromas of grapefruit tempered by earthy malt. The flavor is much the same, with the addition of a super sweet malt+alcohol taste that also provides a rich and somewhat sticky body. I went in kinda fast, but wound up sipping and savoring modestly at the end. Very strong brew that masks itself well, though this is in the neutral zone of American DIPA and Barley Wine."
"fairly clear coppery orangish with a white head that held pretty well and left really georgeous lace. nose was sweet citrus (orange and grapefruit) with a hint of apple flavored bubblegum and a very faint caramelish malt backbone. i could swear i detect a hint of ginger as well even though i know there's none in there. i thought that this was actually pretty well balanced, as the grapefruit and orange rind taste, which definitely played the main attraction, were smoothed out by a nice, caramelly sweetness that wasn't overstated. very silky medium full body with a finish that warms my throat and stomach kind of like a really sweet ginger honey candy. yummy. nice change of pace. i wonder what dedrinker thinks..."
"Pretty good, but it didn't really strike me as exceptional either. Nonetheless, I'd have again and recommend. I split a bottle of this with SurlySober at Comet Cafe in Milwaukee."
"Overall a solid double IPA. The Dogfish 90 minute will remain my go-to for this style."
"Pours from the 22 oz bottle into my Saison Dupont glass a golden, copper, orange color with a low but lasting off white creamy head. High lacing and very clear. Aroma is sweet-malt-hop. Full nose but not overpowering. Freshness and crispness dominate the smell with sweet citrus and an earthy pine. The taste starts out mild but full hops with full bodied malty sweetness come in. Very well balanced and finishes clean with a hint of alcohol. The sweetness is quenching and refreshing not syrupy or thick. Mature. Not bitter but with a consistent hop presence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the flavors are carried by a light to low carbonation. For the strength this is surprisingly drinkable."
"Haven't had a good Double IPA in awhile."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. I don't think this is the greatest DIPA, but it is one to be respected."
"Entered this into our traditional Sunday evening double-IPA bomber rotation. Overall, we were a little disappointed compared with some of its rivals like Hercules, Hop Juice, Dreadnaught etc, but it is good for all that. Fairly clear orange amber with a minimal head and some lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus oozes out of the glass. Not lacking in taste by any means but not enthralling either, and at 11 % it isn't lacking body. Enjoyable, yes. memorable, no."
"Drinkability - this is a very good ale, and I like the subtle wheat taste in an already very subtle malt backbone. Only the high abv limits the sessionability."
"Saw this on a recent beer run to Hudson and it's a DIPA, so I picked it up. Well balanced and tasty. I'll have to try some more of their big beers."
"Again, months later. Tastes... Just not very interesting. You really don't notice the alcohol, FWIW. But... It's just not there. Way too light in color and flavor for me for a DIPA. It seems a lot like Loose Cannon - maybe I should try these side by side? Of course, if they are, indeed, at all similar I'd much rather have the Loose Cannon, of course. Getting the same flavor and intensity out of a beer for 4% less ABV is a feat, IMO."
"Well, I'm stunningly disappointed. I really hope I didn't get an old bottle, as there's no date markings on the bottle at all. I feel like this one deserves another chance, but frankly as this beer is now, I've had better."
"d: Where is the 11%? I really hope I come across some more of this sometime."
"Overall an excellent DIPA. Much different than Southern Tier's IPA. More malt and hops character. Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's - especially on-tap."
"Very drinkable stuff, despite the ABV; or should I say in spite of?"
"D - High alcohol content of this beer doesn't become much of a factor, and the flavor never cloys or becomes unpalatable. A very drinkable version of the style that offers great flavor."
"D-A nice enough beer that I was glad to try but certainly doesn't rate near the top on my top DIPA list"
"drinkability  Has a grapefruit taste to it, I'm not a hop head, so i need to stop drinking these LOL."
"The price-point is attractive and it's friendly enough that I'll likely buy this again, but So. Tier does much better things."
"given the scores, i thought i'd enjoy this more than i did. it looked great in the glass, copper in color with a very slight haze and no visible sediment. aroma was resiny citrus , honeyed sweet malt and tropical fruit. taste was big sweet malt with a lingering hop bitterness. some alcohol was evident in the nose and taste, which is a ding for me. mouthfeel was big-bodied and viscous with the carbonation struggling through this big beer. drinkability suffers a bit due to the heaviness of this one and the high abv."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber. Colour is bronze/orange, with a thin head. Nice piney nose, hoppy, grapefruit, sugary and alcoholic. I was expecting a hop monster, but this is a very drinkable DIPA. It's got a strong malt character. Overall, the taste is pretty intense. It's an assault on your tongue. After the alcohol kicks in, you're just having a good time drinking this beer.. awesome stuff"
"Drinkability- This thing is a monster! Its quite tasty and somewhere between a DIPA and Barley Wine. I really like the fruitiness of the whole thing and quite honestly the balance is superb. Big thanks to BeerTruth!"
"Got in a trade with johnnnniee - many thanks!. Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a slightly hazy orange color. It had a good head that settled into a thin, broken film. Decent carb and good lacing. The aroma was hoppy, piney and grapefruit - the usual ADIPA smell but slightly muted compared to others in the class which worked in this case. The taste was really good. It starts off strong with a good hop bite and finishes with just the right amount of hop bitter aftertaste. Not sure of the age of this one so it may be older and more mellow than normal but I really enjoyed it. It gives the great hop taste without shredding your tongue to oblivion. Great mouthfeel. Overall, a great ADIPA that I highly recommend. Worth the top 100 ranking. (4.5, RR, T, Y)"
"From Notes: On tap at everybodys favorite Boston bar. This is a light orange/brown tinged liquid with a semi-fluffy white/off-whtie head of foam. The aromas are fresh floral hops, with some nice citrusy resins in the mix as well. Lots of pine, and citrus witha bready malt backbone as well. The taste is quite similar to the aroma. This is a big double IPA but it hides its strength well. The hops are abrasive and oily but the malt backbone is big enough to keep this one together. The mouthfeel is medium bodied>thick and the aftertaste of the hop resin oils lingers on the tongue. Very drinkable and quite nice. A solid 4 all the way around and definately one that I will drink again when back eastie."
"D: For the amount of alcohol in this beer, a surprising drinkable and very enjoyable ale. Well done."
"O: enjoyable.. especially when you factor in the abv"
"This one is pretty bitter and hoppy, but very well balanced and almost delicate. Great job in hiding the alcohol in the taste. If you like your DIPAs to be equally malty and hoppy this one's for you."
"Redish orange in color, quite clear, with a pale white-orange head. The smell has a peculiar fruit aroma along with the blast of hops, on top of the malty sweetness. Sour pineapple/mango in the hops, with bitterness and resinous notes. The sweetness and the booziness were nicely in check, most likely drowned out by hops. Mouthfeel was fairly crisp and bubbly, despite its size. Drinkability has to be low, given it's size and commanding hop profile."
"D: It's pretty big in all aspects but it's so easy to drink. The alcohol is extremely well hidden!"
"The aged version is good but the fresh version is better."
"Fairly heavy and just a bit syrupy to the palate. Moderate carbonation and a clean bitterness lighten up the finish. Very clean. I still can't believe this is 11% abv. There is a bit of warmth, but any harsh booze character is totally hidden. Very well crafted. Exactly what I've come to expect from Southern Tier."
"Light amber/copper appearance. Slightly hazed. Thin yet bubbly ivory white head. Lacing comes in sporadice rings. Nice hop nose. Resiny and fruity. Pineapple juice, mango and other tropical hop nuances. Also some sweet caramel malt and a little EtOH. The flavor brings more of the same, but it's more subdued on the palate than on the nose. I would've guessed 153 IBUs would've brought me more bitterness. The bitterness is there, don't get me wrong, but it's not over-the-top. The alcohol actually lingers more than the bitternss. And the hop tones are there, but as I said, more subdued compared to the nose. Some of that pineapple and spiked fruit punch is there. It tastes good. Not great. All around, I find this a solid beer. Good. But it doesn't really stand out from the pack."
"Southern Tiers Imperial IPA is an upper-tier big IPA. Unearthly is recommended to hopheads and those willing to explore a double black diamond in the IPA range. Top notch."
"Overall, a top notch DIPA with nice drinkability. The perfect scratch to my itch for hops."
"Final Statement: Probably the dark horse of the IPA tasting evening. One that I forgot about completey until these notes reminded me."
"Drinkability is only limited by the alcohol level. It is well hidden but this beer is to be savored. I will buy it when I see it."
"D, Notes: A very nice imperial IPA. Smooth and well balanced with an excellent aftertaste."
"Incredibly easy to drink and dangerous too at 11%. A beer you would love to drink all day it is that good. This beer compares favorably with Dreadnaught and the two Pliny's and is right up there with those three beers. Highly recommended for all hopheads."
"Thanks to OWSLEY069 for the bomber!"
"Overall, an all-around solid DIPA. The taste was a bit too malty for my preferences, but certainly flavorful and satisfying."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a slick almost viscous feel. The drinkability is very good when you take into consideration the huge abv."
"Taste is explosive to say the least. Lovely delicate floral sweetness at the top, and then a poof of alcohol goes straight to the nose and then all sense of delicacy goes out the window. Pine, Black Licorice, Orange Peel bitterness. Very herbal hop profile to be sure, a bit medicinal. There's a super-hefty malt bill too, but all that lovely butterscotch and vanilla flavour gets dominated by the hops. Finish is aggresively bitter and fairly dry with nothing but hops left behind. Mouthfeel is buzzing from all the hops and the fairly agressive carbonation, the body is a bit thick and the booze definitely comes through. This is a balls out Double IPA, perhaps the most bitter I've had to date. I find many tend to be more balanced than this, but this is a straight-up hop bomb with no apologies. My first Southern Tier does not disappoint."
"Mouthfeel is super creamy and it's full-bodied. It's slick on the palate with lots of hop resins. Drinkability is hurt a bit by the big alcohol which makes its presence felt a bit too much. Another top notch brew from ST."
"I tried this beer on October 5, 2007 at """Smokeless Joe's""" in Toronto. The aroma was very hoppy and perfumey with a hint of lemon and pine. The colour was a hazy orange with a thin head which lasted. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with high carbonation. The flavour was hops, some citrus tones, and the expected strong bitterness on the back of the tongue."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Thanks to AdamB84 for the bomber. Clear orange color with a medium head. Spare lacing. Hoppy aroma of citrus (grapefruit, mostly), pineapple and other tropical fruit. Taste was nearly the same with just a touch of sugary, malt sweetness. West coast balanced, for sure. (Hop) Oily texture. Maybe the finish could be described at bittersweet, but I definitely wouldn't say bitter. An east coast winner."
"Overall, a solid brew, but the ABV definitely limits the drinkability. When I compare this other Double IPAs, I find it to be a very solid competitor, looking to breakthrough for a shot at the title."
"This beer is a must try for any and all who can get their paws on a bottle. Just wish I brought a case back from NJ instead of just 2 measley bottles!!"
"D - A very well balanced IPA, which is always good in my opinion."
"D: This is a tasty DIPA - not my favorite, but a really good offering. Very tasty and surprisingly balanced for the hop hit that comes through."
"An abundance of hops hit the palate. Lots of citrus, grapefruit, the malts balances everything nicely. A very highly drinkable DIPA. The alcohol is completely undetectable to me. This is an amazing brew glad to have had the opportunity to buy a couple."
"Poured from the bottle, this is a pleasing pale amber color, with a scant white head and minimal white lacing on the glass. There is a faint hop and butterscotch aroma. The taste is of intense piney and citrussy hops(grapefruit and lemon), along with a sweet caramel/butterscotch malty flavor, as well as a cherry/plum brandy fruitiness. The multiple flavors blend smoothly. The mouthfeel is amazingly light and refreshing for a beer measuring 11%ABV. While many will appreciate this IIPA for the hops alone, it is the blending of other diverse flavors into a unique whole that makes this such a memorable brew. Bravo!"
"Have one bottle yourself, or share with a friend. This one deserves the praise it gets...On a final note, please send JAH-VA to IL!!"
"Murky and busy. Decent head, apricot color. As smooth a DIPA as I have ever had. Piney, candy and citrus melded together very perfectly. Balanced well by a gentle malt undercurrent. Easy drinkin' for a big beer, they should sixerize it so that one can do other thinks besides forget what they were going to do after drinking an entire bottle."
"D- This beer is a nice big IPA with some nice, no citrus, hops flavors and some good support from the sweet malt."
"Toasted malt and """unearthly""" hop bitterness up front. Some citrus and some light pine. Fruit cocktail, pear brandy, butterscotch malts, and spices mid-palate. Sharper, more herbal bitterness comes on strong in the finish, along with a noticeable alcohol kick. Careful with this one! Medium-full body with a very creamy, smooth feel. Very nice DIPA, if a little boozy."
"D: This is a very good double IPA. A hop bomb of wonderful flavors but with an excellent balance, something that is too often way off with this style. I loved this beer and would definitely have it again. Worth seeking out."
"D: one or two bombers and you're good - REAL good. This was amazing and a joy to drink."
"Drinking this bottle was like an event, the words """vigorously hopped""" appear on the bottle and are an understatement. Thanks to my beer buddy for another 'hit out of the beer park'!"
"Overall: The best ST brew yet. Tons of flavor man. SOOO complex. This beer is a beer that any brewer would be proud of. BeerTruth send more please."
"D- For an 11% DIPA this is damn tasty and really took care of business last night."
"Overall a great IIPA. I wish I had another!"
"Rich and full mouthfeel, not too tingly, moderate carbonation. Pretty drinkable for the level of alcohol that this one delivers."
"Pours a very clear, dark amber with incredibly bright higlights of gold. Very little head -- just a collar. The nose is very minty, but the hops are joined by a barleywine-esque graham crackery, sweet malt note. The nose reminds me of Anchor Old Foghorn. On the palate, brisk carbonation and fruity, juicy sweetness crop up first, before being matched by minty hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is marked by big carbonation, big alcoholic burn and an almost cloying maltiness. Overall, this is a good double IPA. Not my favorite style, but good considering the competition."
"Cheers"
"D- This DIPA is all about the hop flavor and has little hop bitterness. Its pretty ballsy of Southern Tier to release a DIPA that is 153 IBUs with such little bitterness (Its a good thing). The 11.00% ABV is almost undetectable by this brew. The taste suggests 6-7% tops. This is a good, drinkable DIPA that I will have again."
"D-Well my 1st inclination was to give this a 4.0 on drinkability but as it warmed up and I'm sitting on my deck on a hot summer evening, it began to taste like a barleywine, and that was not what I was looking for. So I had to drop it down some. Also, at 11.00% ABV, how drinkable can it be?"
"I thought this beer had good balanced flavor, and it was pretty drinkable although it didn't blow me away. This one could age pretty well I bet. I usually like when a beer strikes a nice balance but for some reason I was hoping this one would have been more of a hop bomb. Recommended..."
"My first offering and no matter wht I have to do wont be my last from Southern Tier. This is an incredibly tasty well balanced IIPA. I need to find somewhere to deliver a case of this to me. This beer is simply not of this Earth."
"Poures a great golden copper with a nice head that carries great retention. Looks delicious. Smells of citrus, grapefruit, large hops, some floral and a tiny bit of sweetness. Tastes like grapefruit with a big hop finish. A lot of flavors in here but the hops are predominant as expected, and delicious. Not too bitter nor dry. Feels full in the mouth with great carbonation. Cant even detect alcohol. This is a classic and well balance DPA. A must try."
"Pours a rich honey golden brown with a sturdy 2 finger head that leaves plenty of lacing throughout. Smell of this DIPA is phenomenal! Pleasant floral, citrus nose. Taste is great as well, very well balanced with sweet malt and floral hops, nice piney finish leaves palate begging for more. Slight citrus and hidden toffee linger throughout. A most impressive DIPA. Mouthfeel is very smooth and inviting. Drinkability is very good, but the 11.00 ABV should be a warning to anyone. Hats off to Southern Tier for this fantastic brew!"
"D - This sucker almost drinks like a pale ale! The hops, malt and alcohol are all there if you look for them, but if you ignore them they don't bludgeon you for attention."
"This is one of my favorite styles. And now this is one of my favorites within that style."
"D: This is a really nice DIPA, one I'm really happy to have tried. It's a sipper, and not one that I'd have to drink too often. I'd place this alongside the best winter warmers and barleywines, however, and will keep the remaining bottle for sometime next winter. Also, I enjoyed this nearly an hour after removing from the fridge, so it was cool but warmed significantly. One I definitely recommend. Thanks to Joe (chilzwel) for sending."
"Overall, a good beer, but not the best. I really can't complain, given the uber-abv and reasonable price. Worth a try."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear apricot body with a large beige head. Retention is excellent and lacing is lavish and sticky. Aroma is luscious, with citrusy hop oils like grapefruit and pineapple. Orange blossom and pine notes add to the nose. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. A bit resinous. Taste is dominated by a citrusy hop bitterness that is heavy on the grapefruit. Orange and pineapple notes add interest and sweetness. Slight caramel malt presence. Finishes with more grapefruit bitterness. Alcohol is well disguised. Very well balanced, pleasantly complex, and quite tasty."
"Medium bodied with a soft, supple carbonation. Very nicely balanced DIPA, but a bit heavy on the alcohol character."
"Bottle purchased at La Cav du Vin, Cleveland."
"This is one hell-of-a DIPA! Incredible smoothness and drinkability for the style/abv. 153 IBU's show through with a great hop profile, yet with some balance to it. A must-try for hop fans!"
"This is a safety first Imperial IPA: we're talking hard hat, safety goggles, respirator, and fire-ban coveralls, along with elbow and knee pads if you got 'em, it might knock you around, if not knock you down if you're not paying attention. Plus either take the afternoon off, or plan ahead, this bottle takes some time to enjoy and finish, and requires a cooling off period before operating any heavy machinery, or household appliances. Please abstain from contacting former ex's while under it's influence as well, as the safety gear will not help absorb the shock of the potential aftermath."
"This offering is complex and a tasty heavy-hitter. This is a wonderful beer to sip and savor when you are going to have an early night or just want to relax. I am glad I found it and will certainly purchase in the future."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, a nice creamy one-finger tan head, lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, hoppy, citrusy, and a nice touch of pines and caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, with a nice touch of sweetness, a nice touch of grapefruit, slight piney flavor. There's a nice bitter/dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, the sight of this brew is very encouraging when poured, awesome color. Highly recommended. Glad I have a extra bottle (ampzilla)."
"An 11%-Sleeper that i find very easy to drink. Find this and consume mass quantities!"
"*Irony note, I just saw I gave it the exact same score on draft and bottle*"
"The bottle recommends 42 F, which sounds cold, but I wouldn't recommend drinking it any warmer. DIPAs seem to each have a unique balance point, and this one is definitely a bit better on the cooler side. Regardless, this beer demands food accompaniment. Not for the faint of heart of the empty-stomached."
"Served to me at a bar in a big crystal-looking chalice. Deep reddish-brown, thin whispy head, very little carbonation. The smell is very sweet and mellow. American hops fill your nose in the last few seconds of the smell. Starts out thick, chewy and sweet with a buttery undertone. The finish is crispy and dry from the pungent hops. Floral, but sweet hops. Very nice, but one was enough for the sake of making it home after dinner."
"I am a huge fan of IPA's and when I was at the bar the other night I was in wonder of this beer, not because it was an IPA (I had no Idea at the time), but by the tap head. When I tasted the beer, it was mildly hoppy. I was expecting more bitterness. I thought this beer was exceptionaly smooth for a higher alcohol beer."
"D: Thoroughly enjoyable, a nice change of pace for a DIPA. The more I sip, the better I feel."
"Pours a light copper with a one inch creamy, off-white head. Good duration, leading to nice lacing. Initial aroma is what I expected, lots of grapefruit with some pine resins floating in the background. Initial taste is sweet, and the resiny hops seem to take over for the fruit. leaves a thick, heavy bitterness in the back of my throat. A little alcohol heat, but not bad for an 11%ABV. Nice double, but not a beer I'd try to drink more than a pint of at a time."
"Drinkability: While not a beer to cause my brain to explode from its greatness, its still pretty decent."
"My brother-in-law picked it up at a local store in Jamestown, NY."
"Mouthfeel was prickly on the tongue. The body was medium to full. I would like to try this one again, only served colder (I don't say that often!)."
"Quite a nice beer that I would expect will have snuck up on me a bit by the time I finish the bottle."
"D - 11% abv is pretty much hidden in taste, this brew goes down way too easy, so be careful with it."
"Haven't had many Southern Tier offeings; will need to try more."
"A 22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass. It was a clear amber color with a small head. Wonderful aroma: hop resin, pine, something sweet like honey. Flavor's great too. Hops up front, a subtle pine taste. The sweetness in the taste seemed to be more fruity. A substantial beer, one to sip and savor."
"The taste is very well balanced. There is an initial caramel sweetness that quickly fades to a hop bitterness with a lightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is pretty full but exceptionally smooth. This is a very easy to drink double IPA. It's hard to beleive the ABV on this beer."
"pours a deep amber red color, with a head that sticks around for a long time. Smell is very hoppy and citrus. I smell pine as well. Taste is really where this takes off. I was expecting a hop bomb followed by a bitter mouth feel. I experienced the delicious hops, but the backbone is a malty finish that leaves the feeling in your mouth wanting more. Drank this with spicy cheese and french bread. Sipped on this baby all evening. Highly recommended."
"Great orange color to this beer. Sizeable head when poured. Spilled a bit and it feels like a sticky mess. Big ole hop aroma-resiny and piney. A huge blast of malt and hops in the flavor. A real tongue stripper of hop bitterness. Syrupy sweet, malt body to it. Just a great balance between the two. Extremely citrus like. Great body. No trace of 11% here. A very agressive, hoppy beer and done damn well. Along the lines of Moylans Hopsickle. A great blast of hops, malt and beer all around."
"The Unearthly Double IPA pours an expected but nice red, amber orange color into a Stone RIS snifter. With a moderately aggressive pour, the head settles down to a solid creamy top. The smell is all hops - citrus, piney, it really smells like fresh fresh American hops. (The bottle reads that it is brewed with chinook and cascade in the kettle, styrian goldings in the hopback (I guess not all American hops), and the 3 C's for dry hop). The taste is incredible. It's way more balanced than I expected at 11%. Warming ethanol makes way to malt quickly kicked in the mouth by a huge dose of the hops. Delicious. Medium to heavy body, a little viscous. High rating for drinkability. The alcohol is very well hidden. I definitely recommend this brew."
"This is a good DIPA, but I can't say it's anything special. In fact, it reminds me very much of the Stoudt DIPA, but is even sweeter and less drinkable. With so much sweetness and so much alcohol, I'm not sure I'll be able to drink an entire bomber of this stuff. Just not my style I guess."
"A: Amber/gold, head that goes down fairly quick. S: Right from opening the bottle the hops are prevalent, and when poured into the glass it also has a rich smell of lemon squares, pine trees, biscuits, tropical fruit. T: I'm really impressed, for all the hops and the 11% abv I was expecting something much less subtle. Don't get me wrong, it's aggressively saturated with hops, but beyond that the flavors are nice and gentle. Nicely sweet, a bitter finish with some fruitiness remaining. M: Thick and chewy, moderate carbonation. D: The high alcohol content is very hard to detect, and there's a great balance in flavor. Nothing to go nuts over, but a nice, clean double IPA."
"For as strong as this beer is, it's very easy to drink, in a 11% kind of way."
"I find it similar to English style IPAs."
"Its been a while since Ive had an Unearthly, but thanks to Khiasmus. Ive been able to try this again. Id forgotten just how good this beer is. Massive respect to Southern Tier, achieving something like this isnt simple, nor is it common. If you like trying Double IPAs, this should be near the top of your list. Unearthly is fantastic."
"it's tough to give something like this full credit since balance is not even on the horizon. however, i suppose balance isn't really in this style's definition"
"Got one bottle from wcudwight & one from MrBURTON55 (and I'm not sure which one I'm drinking, I'm just damn glad I've got another one left!) Thanks to you both!"
"D- Sigh. I could have a couple of bottles... but then would need a cab home and someone to cover my mouth so i didn't yell enough idiocy to get arrested."
"Eric-"
"22 oz bottle split with a friend and poured into pint glasses. The color was a nice orange with a small white head. The aroma was very reminiscent of tropical fruits. The taste was also heavy on tropical fruit like pineapple. This tasted a lot like Stone 10th. My friend also remarked that it was similar to Talon barleywine. This was a good DIPA but a little too sweet and sticky. I also understand it is not cheap so this would not be a daily drinker (especially given the ABV). I was glad to have the opportunity and thanks go out to Clockworkorange for the trade."
"Pretty incredible - Gordon on steroids, Stone 10 with some age! A very malty DIPA. I like it, but prefer my DIPAs less sweet. Pretty easy to drink, but not going to be mistaken for a session beer."
"A great Imperial IPA, I started to realize that alot of brewerys are going for the high octane IPA, but the Unearthly is balanced and would never guess that it is 11.7%. A great beer for the hop lover (153 IBU's). It does get a bit pricey for a pint, but having more than one of these might be a bad idea. Although, it is that good where 2 or three would be tasty, just a bad idea though."
"Very nicely balanced and quite delicous. Again hops are the name of the game. Pine driven and supercharged. Prickly feel and a nice burn in the chest. However alcohol does not interfere at all. Lemon zest, pink grapefruit, and floral aspects help add complexity while a hint of malt helps keep the hops at bay. Mouth is full, prickly, refreshing and invigorating. Considering the alcohol this bad boy is easily drinkable until it catches up with you."
"Medium body. Very drinkable for the strength."
"Very floral IPA, with a ton of citrusy, tangerine and dried apricot hops on the nose. Fairly thick and noticable malt body; probably a bit of carmel malts in here. Dark sediment lingers at the bottom of the bottle. Recommended a bit cool; as it warms the viscosity becomes more apparent and the carbonation fades from lively to non-existant. Huge, sticky hoppy kick, and a big chewy malt base. 153 IBUs don't really dominate or overpower as one might expect, but do provide a great hoppy contrast to the malts, and do a great job in the process. Bitterness is somehow restrained. Mildly bitter aftertaste. East coast yeast and malt profile. Recommended, but not the best in its class. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and goes down rather easily for such a big beer. At 11%, drinkability is limited. As far as taste goes, I'd like two or three. But, I'd be in bad shape if that were the case. It's a litlle limited due to its strength. Overall, this is an impressive beer. Definitely recommended."
"D - Overall very nice with lots of alcohol, which can hurt the drinkability somewhat, but overall this was very nice and definatly my type of brew. Would love to try one again, as I really thought this was a fine ale."
"Thank you jasonm and TheManiacalOne for sending it."
"Overall a good beer. I wasn't sure at first, but with each sip it honestly got better. I have to say that I am a fan of the DIPA."
"An 11.00ABV DIPA, hello moto! Pure orange in hue with a rocky off-white head that maintains massive patchy lacing; huge head retention going on here. The nose is sweet caramelized sugar, juicy hops and then some. An avalanche of hops from the first sips--pick em--I detect at the least Chinook, Cascade and fresh Centennial hops! A sweet and tainted palate of bourbon-isk liquor with hops lingering in the throat area, a more than welcome warming affect. Warming reveals one remarkable beverage--tastings of grapefruit, bubble gum and loads of orange juice masked beneath the hops; at 153 IBUs, what do you expect. This is a gem, one worth seeking. Repeat and repeat--sip, sip and sip. Savor and enjoy this mammoth DIPA!"
"Overall: This is one of the best DIPA's out there, if not the best (that i have had anyway). One of the best American beers in general. Even if you are not much of a hop head seek this one out, drink it and enjoy this is beauty in a bottle."
"D- This is one huge DIPA. When I first cracked it I didn't know it was 11% so that kind of caught me off guard. It is a really good beer but is very sweet. I don't know how people can say the Burton Baton is to sweet but then drink this?"
"The drinkability is amazing,hard to belive a beer this strong could go down this easy. This is a must try double or imperial IPA what every you want to call it this beer is the shit! Drink with caution."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a golden amber color ale with a medium foamy head with slightly below average retention. Aroma of bitter and citrus is dominating as expected but is well balance with some sweet caramel malt. Taste is also a nice mix between citrusy bitter malt with a nice backing of caramel malt. Body had an oily texture and was about medium full with some low carbonation. Very good take on the style but probably still notch down from my personal favourite such as Dreadnaught and Smuttynose Big A IPA."
"D- While I love hopbombs, this one has something different that I missed - the big hops smell. I enjoyed the chance to try this beer and may try it again, but I think there are other out there that give both your taste and smell that hop explosion."
"Right off the bat, this beer was incredible. Amazing. Now review...poured a 22 oz bottle into pilsener glass. Pours a nice yellow-straw color, not perfectly clear, with a half-finger of head. Smell is fairly mild, surprisingly, good hoppiness but not really out of control. Taste is another story. Fantastic mix of fruits and sweet caramel malts, with a huge blast of unique hops as well. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Feel is medium to full bodied, thick, syrupy, and one that definitely coats your mouth. Excellent aftertaste - a good one to end the night. Really a fantastic beer, with an outstanding flavor. Loses a little for drinkability in terms the high alcohol content, but overall absolutely great."
"220z bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear, medium straw colour with very little carbonation or head. Aroma is hoppy, but doesn't seem to be as strong as some of the best of the style. But the taste is very, very nice. Very full taste, chock full of hops and well-rounded. A good balance of bitter and floral hops, just the way I like it. This one is a treat, although I rated it slightly below the Stone Ruination."
"This is very drinkable for a 11% ABV, 153 IBU bomb. Southern Tier has nailed this one down pretty well. My only critiques, are I like a bit more of a hop nose, and a touch more thickness. But that being said, this is still an excellent DIPA. Probably my 2nd fave from East of Mississippi just nudging out Dreadnaught. Hop Slam is still #1. But this is a close second."
"Bomber courtesy of HogTown Harry- cant say enough good things about that beer swilling dude This is a kick ass beer. Plain and simple. My apologies to Fisherman34 for not saving this bottle to taste- its been a long week and I was in desparate need of hops. Sorry man Poured into a normal pint glass. Quite clear beer- usual IPA color with good head. Aroma is top shelf - a wave of amarillo hops hit me Sweet sweet amarillo hops. This may be the best aroma Ive ever had the pleasure. Simply outstanding. My taste buds are watering at this point so time to dig in. Taste does not dissapoint. Hops assault my mouth, but in a very good way. Not astringent at all. The bittering hops are there dont get me wrong, but the bitter holds its ground for just the right amount of time and then gives way to a malty sweetness and the aroma hops. If I had to fault this beer, it is on the sweet side, but given the 11%, not a surprise. Not overly sweet, I thought played well with the hops. The centennial and amarillo dry hopping is a nice touch and blend together wonderfully. This beer is all about the hops and hits the mark. Outstanding!"
"A very good beer from Southern Tier. I'm still madly in love with their Jah-Va stout, but this is a nice change of pace."
"Good drinkability overall, a bit too sweet for me to have much more than this bomber. I like a drier, more resin-like DIPA personally. Its good stuff though and worth a try."
"Next to Great Divide's Hercules this is my favorite double IPA. I've yet to try the super upper class of the west coast IIPA's, but until then this will my standard."
"the first beer sampled from my first BA Anny bomb...courtesy of BeerBeing"
"D: This beer definitly leans on the hop side. A tad too sweet for my taste but a fine brew none the less. The flavors seem to meld together alittle better as the beer warms. Recommended."
"I've been wanting this brew for some time and found it in Cleveland. Boy this beer is excellent. Poured a clear amber hue with a 2 inch beige head that left a excellent amount of sticky lace on the glass. My lips were also smacking with a sticky and salty residue. Upon pouring, a blast of pine and grapefruit (chinook and cascade hops)hit my nose with a yeasty dough scent. Great caramel flavor beginning with a long grapefruit bitter aftertaste. Smooth, crisp with a medium body, soft cabonation somewhat syrupy and dry ending with a hint of alcohol made it perfect for a session. Overall, I could drink this brew all night. The aroma, taste, appearance and mouthfeel was a near perfect harmony. The bad thing is, I can not found it anywhere near me. Enjoy"
"I would have again for sure.I would love to have out of a tap for have Dry Hopped.But the hops are more then enough potent for me as of now."
"Great, great brew that Ive had the good fortune to sample as a result of <winning> super bowl o beer 2007  and ol Mark, the TheManiacalOne, was kind enough to pay with."
"This Imperial IPA has a nice mouthfeel, not too carbonated and fairly light bodied for its strength. One of the few beers in this style that my wife finds palatable and that's saying something. Compare to Weyerbacher Double Simcoe IPA which she will never touch again."
"Sampled at the Drafting Room Best of 2006 night. Beer poured a red, amber color with a fairly thick white head. The aroma provides a good piney and citrus fragrence that is pleasing to the nose. The taste is similar with a nice big hop explosion on your taste buds, citrus and pine. There is a touch of malt on the backend and some real notes of the high abv. Medium body and a nice mouthfeel round out this beer so well."
"Notes, May 17, 2008: Originally bought 2 bottles of this back in early 2007 (I think). Had #2 last night and it was still tasty. As expected, it had mellowed a bit and was more like a barleywine. But the hops were still there and if anything it was a bit smoother all around -- not much evident heat from the alcohol, and a nice balance between hops and malt sweetness, with the malt more dominant. So IMHO, this beer can be cellared, at least for a year to a year and a half. . . ."
"Great DIPA overall. Will definitely seek out another bottle in the future."
"Find it, buy it, drink it. Actually, buy a few. I'm really not sure if this is """limited""" or around all the time. Hopefully this is part of their usual lineup, it's damn good."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass at 43 degrees (F), it pours a classic amber color with a finger-thick, decently dense, spongy, clingy (on the glass) head that is eggshell in color. The nose is quite pleasant and not too bold, but still enough hops. For 11%, not much alcohol hits my nose, but the hoppiness is clean and floral, and not overly big. Some slight sugary sweetness also hits my nose, but the subtle hops take over the aroma of this one. The sip reveals a quite sweet shot up front of some rock candy, with a biscuity flavor coming through that reminds me of mom's chicken and dumplings (YUM!!). The hope end up taking over with bitterness, along with a healthy dose of alcohol that comes and dries it out almost completely, leaving almost a bourbon aftertaste (feeling also). Carbonation is mild on the sides of my tongue and the bitterness makes me feel like I'm eating hops, and the alcohol makes this very dry. Overall, one bottle will do for me I think. I'm not a true hophead, but I enjoy hoppy beers, and this one gets kinda messy in my opinion. Maybe letting it age a bit would help."
"Wow, bitter...but I love it. This color is a faded orange with a nice foamy head. It was a bit grainy which fits well with the """Unearthly""" character. It reminds me a bit of Ithaca's Flower Power. Quite drinkable for a DIPA, if you're someone who enjoys your hops. I would definitely avoid this beer if you dislike beer with """bite""". But it surely has character, and on tap is absolutely amazing (Blue Tusk)."
"This was a hop monster of a beer, blown away by this one. Big taste throughout. Recommend this one to only seasoned, big time, over the top hop monster heads."
"D: Not bad, but not worth $8 a bottle. Great mouthfeel, but the taste is tiring and brash."
"Full body DIPA with a good amount of carbonation. 11% abv and you don't even notice it. Well, until after you finish the whole bottle anyway. Dry? Yup. Bitter? Absolutely. Should you run out and get some? You bet. Damn fine brew. Thanks, Jim. I gotta go get some more of this one."
"THis is my first Southern Tier....picked up a bottle at Capone's outside of Philly. Pours light brown, muddy clay color. almost no head. looks strong with sticky lacing. Not a terribly odiforous beer really. Hops are obvious on the nose, but they are drenched in boozy sweet malt odor. Oily hop and alcohol flavor. hops are the defining flavor and there is a good amount of bitterness but not a ton. I wouldn't call it a complex beer, but it definitely qualifies as a double IPA so it lives up to that. Not exactly """unearthly""" though. I'd have another of these but it's not my favorite."
"Certainly a tremendous beer. It offers an extremely bold, yet delicate balance of intense malt sweetness and hop intenisy and flavor. The dryness of the hops, combined with the pronounced alcohols leaves a very spicy and dry sensation immediately. The flavors, though rich with caramels and barley, are thinned by the alcohols and citrus hops. The hops deliver strong citrus, pine, and earthy flavors of higher proportions. Along with flavor, the hops give a serious bitterness without the soapy, metalic flavors expected in big ipa's. The feel is full and rich, but I stop shy of saying 'thick or heavy'. Finishes with a focus on the dry, spicy hops with back-up tones of carmel malts and smooth fermented barley. Well balanced and strong flavored. Not for the timid, but pleasant after getting past the bitter shock."
"Overall, this is an incredibly flavorful and drinkable DIPA. Truly an outstanding example of the style."
"I love Double IPA's and this one is no exception to the rule. I can't really say anything negative about the appearance on this beer. It has a good amber looking color, with a sticky white head that is just the right size. Smell is big on the sweet syrupy hops, but also has a bit of bitterness as well. With some warming, a nice grapefruit/tangerine aroma pulled through. Taste was sweet up front, with the oily hops in the back. Aftertaste was a mix of fruit and resin like hops if that makes sense. Mouthfeel is pretty big for a Double IPA....not huge, but certainly big. You can taste the alcohol on this one, but it is so damn easy to drink that it can be easy to forget. This is my buddy Ian's favorite IPA out there. I gotta say that he is right that this is a great example of the style. Definitely not my favorite, but really good in my book. I bet it would pair well with a whole list of cheeses. Cheers"
"A very well composed IIPA, well integrated, tasty, drinkable. Highly recommended. Southern Tier is not second tier."
"I don't know where those 153 IBUs are hidding, but this is still a pretty awesome big beer. Overall the taste and aroma were surprisingly sweet. Smelled almost medicinal with a bit of spicey hops coming through. Candy-like malt flavor mixed with citrus hops made up a flavor that came off a little creamy, probably from the red wheat. Maybe the most drinkable DIPA I've had, no hint of the 11% as the beer warms."
"The bottle lists the ABV, platos, IBUs, and malts and hopsAND even the temperature and glass type to serve this delicious liquid. Its the beer that keeps on giving!"
"thanks to Ed from Philly, the DArkOne, for securing my sample."
"2010 edit: They've cleaned up their fermentation at Southern Tier This 2006 review above was a fair one on a fresh bottle, and Unearthly is simply more Unearthly now. All the hits it took in my original view are gone. Flavor is great until the last swallow. I gave it a 4.0 before, and it's earned a promotion."
"drinkability - I've always found Southern Tier's beers while not a great example of the style to be very drinkable. East Coast for sure, hides the alcohol very well at 11%. Another clean solid beer."
"The total is greater then the sum of the parts. Great beer with a sharp chedder cheese and crackers as a relaxing snack. A very fine offering that I plan on stocking up on every time it gets released."
"This ones not bad at all. Its quite aggressive, a little bit boozy, but the bottom line is that its really quite good."
"Pours a clear copper, huge thick white head forms, some of the prettiest and most massive lace I've ever seen, great retention, this shit really sticks. Smell is huge, big hops and malt, sweet toffer, grains, pine and floral, big citrus, unbalanced in the greatest way. Taste is sweet up front, then attacks with crazy pine and floral hops, citrus grapefruit assault, , excellent balance between the hops, crazy but not crazy, clean bitterness in the finish, 153 IBU? Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied, low carbonation, sticky, 11%? This beer looks massive on paper, but the balance is so incredible, you could sip this all day. Sorry Michigan Brewing, this is what a DIPA should be like."
"Had this on tap at Redbone's in Somerville MA. Lovely deep amber color with a 1/2 inch fine textured head. Incredibly fragrant, the hops just jump out at you. Taste is big citrusy hops with a slightly sweet malt backbone that never becomes cloying, Really a nicely balanced beer. The alcohol manages to hide pretty well behind the hoppy facade. I think my friend summed it up when he ordered one and took his first taste - wow!!"
"Taste is bittersweet at first, much more bitter and the hops are pronounced. Smooth, rich, and creamy is how I would characterize the malts. Juiciness towards the end with not much carbonation. Bitter all the way through but there's a sweetness at the end. Alcohol is present and warm, a bit spicy, but blends well. A fine brew."
"Pours a crystal clear brilliant amber with a dense creamy resinous head. The aroma is a fabulous balance of citrus and earthy hops and sweet malt. The flavor features a dump truck of hops. Damn. Very aggressively bitter. Citrus and earthy notes, just as the aroma. Sweet malts work through, as does the alcohol. At 11% the alcohol is apparent, but not doesnt come off as hot. Slick over the tongue. A welcome beer in my glass any day."
"Overall this is good, or even great in some ways, but the flavor clashes and it is missing any magic. Too clean just like an album that sounds too clear and polished. You need some grime, some pizzazzz, some funk. Pretty badass in malt and bitterness, but it needs at least a hint of yeast character."
"Taste is a bit more original, very flavorful, big taste, hoppy and quite earthy. There's a woodsy thing in here that's meaty and bold. It's almost a meal. Mouthfeel is simple and good. This brew is quite tasty. And for 11%- this is a sneaky, evil little bastard. Long live DIPAs."
"Dark amber color an off white head dies to a moderate bubbly pool. Lots of nose activity with sweet floral hop notes in layers of dryness, citric acidity, and sour and some caramel malts and fruity esters. Right away you notice its wonderful balance. Roasted malts, caramel characters surrounded by extraordinarily tasty dry bitter hop characters. Alcohol is there but at eleven percent it does a great job of not making a dominant force. Fantastic mouthfeel that maintains crisp even carbonation to the end. Notes of toffee and buttery flavors get stronger as it warms. Again a tremendous hop addition and excellent balance makes this one a brew I will have to have again."
"This beer pours a clear reddish orange with a giant white foamy head. Nice lacing and head retention. The smell isn't as strong as I hoped,but you can make out some """bisquity""" scents along with brown sugar, alcohol,and hops. The taste is very hoppy with a high alcohol content along with bitter hops, and brown sugar. A very good taste with the m/f being well balanced and all flavors mixing well. A very good beer from a brewery that's very underated."
"drinkability is dangerously good. as i said above, so well balanced you'd never know it is more than 7 or 8%abv. really great beer and a definite treat for the hopheads out there."
"This is an outstanding beer. I have had it on tap on two occasions and it holds up well in a 22 ounce bomber. The ABV is well hidden with the hop/malt balance of this beer which reminds me a little of Devils Dancer. It has a strong nose of hops. A great brew."
"There's a time and place for a beer like this, sip it slow through the night. This is some exceptional stuff."
"Excellent beer...one finger of foam never fully disappears. Deep copper color and my-oh-my tons of hops. Especially noticeable floral aroma of cascade hops. Medium to slightly heavy mouthfeel with loads of bittering hops. Amazingly, the 11% ABV is pretty successfully masked, that is, until you take that last sip! I'll definitely want to find another bottle of this!"
"I could drink lots of this! Easy on the palate, very mild yet very pleasing to drink. I really like this one and will buy many more. Highly recommended."
"Sweet Jesus, the hops! And yet, the fact that there's a real balance speaks volumes to the arful crafting of this hoppy lupulin landslide. It's simply a gem of an enamel-eater. The ABV is plenty big, but slyly incorporated, so beware, my friends! So yes, it is drinkable, but make this the last beer you drink for the evening, because it lays happy waste to the 'buds. That's okay, because whatever world this one's from, I can finish on it quite contentedly. In fact, there's only a handful I'd choose over this fine offering."
"Cheers!"
"153 IBU's according to the bottle, this is surprisingly well balanced, and not as hoppy as I was expecting. Nicely sweet with bitter grapefruit overtones. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and somehow the 11% ABV is entirely masked. This goes down easy, which is frightening, considering how potent this beer is."
"Poured from a big bomber and felt the buzz before I was half done. This beer straddles the line between double IPA and barley wine, but stays more firmly attached to the DIPA side of the fence. Lots of grapefruit-like hops and a nice thick mouthfeel. Very good flavor which sticks in your mouth, it even burned out the flavor of onions from dinner. Recommended."
"Crisp, bitter and incredibly smooth drinkability for a beer of 11% abv. Slight alcohol warmth, crisp carbonic bite and hopalicious hopnacity!"
"Judging based solely on flavor, I could drink this baby all damn day. It is that good...no, GREAT. Throw in the alcohol factor, and I would have to say one bomber is enough. Tolerance allowing though, this is just smooth as silk and ultra-balanced. A magnificent Imperial IPA, Triple IPA even, that is probably my second favorite, right behind Yulesmith. Which is a feat in itself. Hats off to Southern Tier for brewing one of the best beers in the entire world."
"D: This one is very tasty and light for a 2IPA. This is now one of my favorites. Once you start drinking it, you’ll find it hard to switch to anything else."
"Only the brave would session this bad boy. One bomber usually can do the job. A smooth beer, but don't forget about the 11%."
"A very good beer in bottles became a great beer on tap. If you ever have a chance, do yourself a favor and get a glass. You'll be glad you did."
"Drinkability: I will have no problem sipping this bomber, it is a tasty beer, I just want bigger hops. The name is clever, as this beer definitely of this world."
"D - The alcohol is well hidden making this one very drinkable. The ABV will sneak up on you with this one."
"Drinkability: a superb DIPA that is easy drinking and flavorful. The high alcohol levels knock this down a notch, but this is one great beer."
"D - A hop bomb for lovers of hop bombs. A little malt sweetness for balance might be nice, but might also not be what the brewers were going for."
"A clear, orange/copper color with a frothy, thick head that left behind considerable lacing. Heavy carbonation. Aromas of hops, citrus, toasted grains, fresh bread, oil, and flowers. The taste follows the nose with hops clearly dominating. Crisp and refreshing with citrus flavors adding a nice aftertaste. Slightly creamy in my mouth with a pronounced bitter finish."
"I really enjoyed savoring this bomber for 2 hrs...enjoying every sip."
"Drinkablity: Its a hefty one. A little too bitter for mass appeal, I would guess. However, hop heads will enjoy it very much."
"I could drink several of these assuming I had nowhere to go. Like tonight. These Southern Tier guys really know how to get it done. Excellent brew."
"I had a chance to try a split off a big bottle of this last evening. Wow! Good color, nice head, inviting. Impressive hop aroma, substantial hop flavors (perhaps more Cascade in the aroma and flavor than I'd like, but that's ok) but so beautifully balanced with the dryness of the alcohol (high at 11%) and the chewy caramely malt that it sure shocked me when I heard how many IBUs it had in it. A very nice example of the style. By the name alone I had expected a bigger dose of hops, the balance thrown badly askew, so I was quite happy. I think this would hold up well against similar product from other makers (Victory, Stone, Stoudt, DFH Burton?), but I think the true hop-head would probably be better off with Weyerbacher Hops Infusion or Three Floyds' Dreadnaught or maybe even the (lighter single IPA) Legacy HHH because of this deceptive balance. Hmmm. I am likely to add this to my regular rotation of big bitter beers as long as we can get it."
"Rich copper body with golden highlights. This beer almost glows. It's topped by a thick long-lasting head that has a nice yellow-cream color. Aroma is great, with nice hop florals and a hint of citrus and pine touched by malty alcohol sweetness. The flavor is also fabulous, with a restrained bitterness. The flavor focuses more on actual hop flavor than just over-the-top smack you in the kisser IBUs. Great tangerine, pineapple, and pine rosin flavors that are very well balanced with the malt profile. This beer also does not seem to be 11% ABV; it's very well crafted. Mouthfeel is solid, without the thickness of most big beers. Drinkability is fantastic. I've gotta get some more of this beer."
"Poured a copper color with a medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus fruits, pine, caramel malts, fresh cut grass, and some alcohol as well. Taste included much of the same, with some tangerine, and a fair amount of alcohol in the finish."
"A pleasantly flavored Double IPA with a deceptive alcohol presence. I don't care if this is 11% abv, fill me up a growler!"
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this one. I've come to find that these guys are hit or miss at times with their brews and with one that lists 153 IBU's, I was expecting quite a bit. And boy did it deliver! It pours smoothly into my pint glass with a rich, frothy head and an orange-almost reddish color. The aroma of hops dominates his beer and going in for the first sip, I was worried that it would be too much. On the contrary, it was perfectly balanced. This is a true hop-heads delight. Demand your local shop get this one in immediately."
"This isn't as hoppy as the 153 ibu's on the bottle would suggest. The hops don't destroy your palate. Well balanced. Also not as sweet and sugary as some DIPAs, such as the DFH 90 min for example (although that's a quality I do enjoy in DIPAs). Make sure to let it warm because I didn't like this at first taste and I've been scrolling back up to change my review with each taste as it warms. Good stuff."
"22 ounce bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"This is a big beer, but with lots of balance that makes it a very enjoyable sipper. Something I will seek out again and maybe even stock up on. A must try if it's available to you."
"A dark mahogany reddish/brown which is clear with a one finger white head. Taste reminds me of a 90 minute, warm and sweet , perfect in my book. Mouthfeel is different than the 90 minute, this is thicker with a little more bitterness to the finish. One thing I love about Southern Tier is the bottle gives you the geeky beer numbers and ingredients, bottle design is also top notch."
"I would have gave this little beer it if were not for the lack on consistency. I bought a couple bottles of this about a week ago and had one right away. Thought it had a great hoppiness to it, nice amber color and decent head. And believe you and I, the 11% abv does give you a little kick. Had another bottle last night and it was completely different, sever lack of head and a completely different taste, so much so that i thought i was drinking another beer. Lack of the same amount of hops smell from my sample no less than a week before. Will definetly have to try again and see which result i can create."
"D - high for hopheads, others who dont particularly enjoy hops may find this brew too bitter"
"Pours a reddish gold with an initial decent head.. Smell is rich..a blend of yeast and hop aromas. The taste is an explosion of hops, but in a smooth presnetation...no harshness. Excellent for the high abv...very little """bite""". Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, which leads into a very good drinkability rating."
"22 oz bomber. Pours a vert deep golden color with a half finger of head that falls to a lightly broken head over top. Clarity is excellent, and there is no apparent carbonation bubbling up in the glass. This is a really good looking brew. It almost has a glow to it. The aroma is very thick. It has huge caramel notes balanced out by big juicy and sweet grapefruity hop. There is a lot of sweetness in the nose here. Its almost a bit too much for me. Flavor is pretty nice. It is definately dominated by big caramel maltyness. It is backed with a moderate grapefruity hop and a very mild and faint piney hop that is mostly flavor. The bitterness on the finish is very mild, and I think this keeps the beer very easy drinking. There is really no hint of the 11% ABV in the flavor at all. Mouthfeel is thick, almost a touch slick and syrupy. The carbonation is pretty much absent, so this one really sits heavy. As far as DIPA's go, this one is working well for me. The nose is a bit strong in sweetness, but this is more balanced in the flavor. Its defintaly letting me know that the alcohol is there as I drink more of it, but its not in the nose or flavor. This is a nice DIPA."
"Draught @ RedBones 7/6/06. Pours a bright redish amber color with a small off white head. Nose is syrupy sugar with some faint hop notes and a caramel malt presence. Mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, can almost feel the sugar granules. Flavor leaves much to be desired. Hops are there but are overtaken by syrup, sugar and a sticky caramel maltiness. Finishes with a light bitterness and a sticky mouth."
"Not super thick, but definitely not thin...or even medium. Nice carbonation and it's pretty balanced. Mind-blowingly easy drinking for 11%. Anytime something 11% goes down this easy I just have to give it a high number."
"D - This is one very drinkable beer considering the ABV and the fact that it's a huge IPA."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a majorly big body. The alcohol compliments the beer providing spicyness without heat. This beer is very drinkable. The beer is a party in a bottle for one or two people."
"On tap 9 months later, big bitterness."
"a hophead's dream.. close to behemoth barleywine in its succulence. a really good choice."
"amazingly drinkable given the alcohol and IBUs. nicely complex hop flavors with a medium-bodied, refreshingly drinkable mouthfeel. sugary caramel start, then finishes with a citrusy, fruity hoppiness. impressively balanced, and a great beer."
"Bomber, without freshness or vintage dating. This stunner pours a bright copper shade of amber, clear and glistening. Supports a long lasting, creamy tan head, and leaves thick, sticky and long lasting stringy lacing after a swirl.. Aroma is of goey, oily hops. Lots of grapefruit, and oily hop crunch in the flavor profile here. Full bodied and full flavor DIPA. Smooth and heady brew, alcohol clearly present, but its layered and dovetailed nicely into and within the layers of hops/malty base. Complex, strong, bold and highly recommended creation. Fine sipper/nightcapper"
"Thanks to Lagrin for the sample."
"A good DIPA. I think I may be tiring of this style, I just feel the alcohol is too prominent, not a bad thing, but it tends to lead the style streamlined."
"Reddish-amber bodied ale topped by thin flecks of foam. Nose of sweet pine sap, cotton candy, tangerine, and lupulin. Fresh punch of hops batters my tongue with bitterness. Some fusels due to high alcohol content. Tropical fruit flavors of pineapple, mandarin orange, and mango mingle with citrusy resinous hops. A truly unearthly combination of hops (Chinook, Cascade, Centennial, & Styrian Golding) that packs a wallop. Definitely approaches triple IPAhood. I took my time polishing off the bomber."
"Pours dark burnt orange with a nice cream colored head that fades rapidly. Smells of pine trees, big piney hops, but also a big malty sweetness. Bitterness envelopes the tongue as soon as it hits your mouth, there is definitely a strong malt bill in this, it is evident in the mouthfeel and in the smell and taste, but the hops dominate in the taste. A little alcohol warmth/burn towards the finish of the taste, letting you know this beer is big. Some thick and syrupiness maltiness in the mouthfeel that finishes dry and bitter. A big thanks to bjohnson for scoring this great dipa for me."
"Beer is good. Happy 2IPA-slash-barleywine beering."
"Unearthly (adj.): concerned with or affecting the spirit or soul. Southern Tier's foray into the world of DIPAs with Unearthly Imperial IPA is an unqualified success. Although it may not 'wow' me the way some versions do, it's definitely a beer that is long on spirit and soul. It's worth getting to know over the course of a slowly sipped bomber. A big thank you to Calico for the bottle."
"Overall impression: This is one terrific brew! Hop-heads take heed...this is good stuff. Southern Tier continues to impress me. World Class in my book."
"If I ever move back to Buffalo, access to nectars such as this from S.T. will be a non-trivial deciding factor."
"Deep orange and clear, this was topped by a thick eggshell coloured head. Superb retention and clumpy lacing was left behind right down to the bottom of the glass. Intense pine aroma with orange and grapefruit taking a bit of a back seat. Alcohol was very faint. Solid sweetness up front that became milder later on, with a solid, balanced bitterness. Some caramel and mostly piney hops. Alcohol appeared in the end and lingered in the finish (along with hops and bitterness). Full body, low carbonation and slightly sticky. A well-balanced combination of hops, malt and alcohol."
"Quite thick for the style, which i actually think worked out quite nicely. Highly drinkable - all around, a great beer,"
"Split with a fellow BA london101 at D's Sixpack, where it was sampled at nearly cellar temperature...next time we'll start it a bit cooler and let it warm up. Either way I love Southern Tier and I may be a bit biased here but let's review. As we pour it appears a nice vibrant copper amber colore with a full tan off white cream head leaves even bars of lacing with each sip. Aromatics hit you in the face with big floral and citrus hop combo grapefruit and green raw hops flood the senses along with a woody charred tone and big malty caramel tones with alcohol letting it's presence especially near cellar temp. Flavor profile is big with upfront bitterness more fresh hop juice flavor candied with the sweet caramelized sugary malt layers with a bitey herbal citrus hop character it all flows nicely together. Intense and aggressive hop profile can't wait to sample again there's layers of flavors yet remains somewhat balanced, weird? Mouthfeel is big bodied creamy textured oily with hop resins for certain even but sturdy carbonation to back up the high gravity. Drinkability is money, another quality hopped up creation from upstate NY thanks to Phinn and Matt especially the one that is still there I can't remember at this time, good stuff great double IPA."
"Just be careful of the 11% ABV. Other than that, I want to try this big bodied beer the next time on on a walk in the woods. Great with cheese and crackers or BBQ (hot dogs/hamburg)."
"and it finished off the evening better than a piece of pie."
"Had it in a pint glass, served from 650ml bottle. Nice and red with a small but noticable head. Deliciously hoppy from the start with a slight (very slight) syrupy flavor. Very bitter, but in a good way. I wish I had a couple more to drink right now, but the store's closed."
"Mouthfeel is rather big and chewy...this one really makes itself known with each sip. Mellower on the carbonation side, which is nice. I really enjoy the flavor here, but the 11% abv hinders the drinkability a bit for me, as this bomber is gonna get me plenty buzzed. Overall, a wonderfully hoppy brew that still maintains a sturdy malt backbone...this is a DIPA I hope to have the chance to come back to again sometime and another winner for Souther Tier. Thanks warriorsoul!"
"D- Very, very smooth for a double IPA. 11% is not evident in taste, but after one bottle I could feel it in my brain. Best to enjoy in moderation."
"Holy hops!! What a beer this is. Grassy smell and taste, grapefruit galore. Only problem is, too much alcohol. A person can only drink a couple of these, if they are in a 12 oz. bottle, cause it waxes you!!! But it has nice malt character on the front end, followed by some outrageous hops. Great divide IPA is probably the closest to this terrific beer. Highly recommended, just don't drink too many."
"Comments  Thanks to BeerGuy for donating this monster bomber to skyhands Broken Fridge party."
"Probably the most drinkable 11% beer I've ever had. Very dangerous. You don't notice the alcohol until it hits you. At $6.99 a bottle I would probably be satisfied drinking two Big Foots instead of this, but still one of the better double IPA's out there."
"This certainly isn't a beer for all day pounding, but as DIPA's go, this one is right there. Great hop character, enough malt backbone for balance, and a good alcohol kick, which, let's face it, is part of the DIPA thing. Overall, a very nice job, and a good representation of the style. And at 11%, it will hurt you quick!"
"Drinkability & Notes  Great beer, more like a double red along the lines of Nugget Nectar than a traditional double IPA, did I really just say traditional DIPA? The malt character is much more evident than is standard for the style, but the hops are still huge, fresh and clean. By far the best beer I've had from Southern Tier, time to grab a couple more bottles of this."
"Well done..."
"A fresh, unfiltered pint on tap would be stellar."
"Mouthfeel is slightly chewy with orange candy sweetness."
"very good drinkability for a double IPA or any beer for that matter, the bomber is almost gone and it seems like i just started. a rock solid example of the style, and a near perfect beer. this one definitely achieves excellence."
"This is the best DIPA I have tried so far (havent been that many yet unfortunately). I beer like this proves amply that DIPA is just as complex and nuanced a style as a Belgian Quad or a Russian Imperial Stout. They arent just about high hop levels."
"Poured a great rich clear bronze witha very well retained 1/2 finger head with a fine bead just a pleasure to look at I have to say.The aromas are quite citric alot grapefruit in there maybe a note of apricot over top of caramel malt a whif of alcohol shows thru more so as it warms.This is not an in your face DIPA although the hops do pack a good punch not to mention alot of complexities citrus and piney cascades and chinooks really show themselves I even get a little earthiness as it warms saying all that there is a big enough of juicy lightly sweet caramel malt backbone to almost hold up against the hop onslaught.Wow amazed at this beer the alcohol is so well hidden you would have no idea how big it was and the hops take the show,"an unhibited infusion of hops""" per bottle that sums it up,kick ass!"
"Very enjoyable and drinkable. Beer flavors balance out superbly with the alcohol there to remind you of its """double-ness.""" Despite the high ABV very drinkable and enjoyable. I'll look for this again soon."
"Drinkabilty of this beer is exceptional.I want to drink my other one even though it'll wreck me for the night."
"I am so sold on Southern Tier beers, it's not even funny. I tried and thoroughy enjoyed their IPA and the Java Stout, but this is better than either of those. What makes it incredible is the fact that it is a whopping 150 IBUs (it says it right on the side...props to the brewers for providing all the numerical info right on the side of their bottles) and is balanced with a piney sweetness, but is not syrupy in the least. This beer is of the quality of DFH 90 min, but bigger. I loved the cascade hop dominated taste, because it was so balanced. I could truly drink this beer all night (scary thought)."
"Southern Tier has a good thing going with their new series. Its just smart marketing in my opinion. The 22oz bottles make for a good sit down session at home. I LOVE that they list the specific hops, malts and grains they use. Now that Im a home brewer, I can actually visualize what went into the beer I am drinking. Itll also come in handy when I try to make a clone of this one!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2""" beige head over the clear deep copper brew. Head lasts well for the style, and lacing is prevalent. Aroma is fruity hops, with some pine underneath, not as intense as I had expected. Flavor makes up for the any lack in the nose, hops are front and center. Lupalin slam in the teeth, then mellows down a bit and you can feel the malt and alcohol warming everything it touches. Mouthfeel is impressive for something so hoppy, and drinkability works as well. Nice job with one."
"Taste is of...suprise!...HOPS! Starts with a mild bitterness courtesy of the chinook and cascades that is lifted by the decent amount of carbonation. Tough to detect the malt here, but I'm sure it's there helping to balance this one out. For 11%abv, amazingly you cannot detect the alcohol, which brings up the drinkability considerably. This is easily the best double IPA I've ever had, and will give me a great scale to judge others by. Highly recommended."
"M & D: Both are great. Slick in your mouth with an almost oily feel upfront that leaves pretty quickly. Carbonation at first but also fades fast leaving you with a nice floral aftertaste. Well balanced dipa. Not much bitterness to this one, but an awesome offering from Southern Tier--my favorite from them so far."
"Clear copper, with traces of carbonation rising to a soapy ecru froth, which is not too big since I poured it into a fluted glass as per the bottle's instruction. Aroma is piney, piney, piney! Subsequent sniffs reveal a sugary candied citrus peel scent, but man is this one about the hops and nothing else! The taste, fortunately, does not follow the nose. I say fortunately, because that aroma led me to expect something obscenely over-the-top pine juice phenomenon. Instead I get a much more subdued and subtle citrusy pine flavor with a sweet caramel malt follow-through. I do think there are some reasonable limits as to the outrageousness of the hops in a DIPA, and hence, I believe that a certain """balance""" is feasible and appropriate to expect. Southern Tier achieves such balance with Unearthly. As it warms, more malt emerges, and the flavors become rounder, softer, and fuller. Something of a mineral twinge at the finish. Hop bitterness lingers. Lacing is webby, but head retention is minimal -- 11% abv will do that to a beer, I suppose. Medium bodied and juicy. Not my favorite DIPA -- meaning there are others I'd pick up instead on a more regular basis --, but this is absolutely stunning as a foray into """Big Beer""" territory."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid malt bill that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with a wonderful hop aroma. It's intensely bitter, but equally stong in malts giving it a warm and balanced scent. The taste is great as well. It has a rich malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and satisfying. The hops are true all the way through and add a kick ass bitter bite which helps hide the elevated abv.. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer that is quite drinkable even with an 11% abv.. It's just another fine offering from Southern Tier."
"Overall, this is a great double IPA. One of the better hop bombs that I have had."
"22oz bomber. Deep, crystal clear filtered amber. The head rises to 2/3""" or so before settling to a steady layer leaving intricate lace. Hop notes immediately pull you in for an intense piney and perfumey assault on the senses. A sturdy multi-grain character balances with some bready notes in the nose. Floral and perfumey hops once again are predominate in the taste followed by piney and citrus elements. The caramel sweetness lent to the brew by the hefty grains is countered nicely by a reassuring warming by the alcohol. This brew is quite comfortable subbing for a fine cognac with it's intense aromatics and warming effect. I'm kickin back like the ladies man Leon Phelps with this bad boy. But there it goes again petitioning me to drink again...and again...I of course oblige, possessing little restraint. The body however welcomes consumption in this manner as it is moderate/medium sans the syrupy thick mouthfeel of other similar brews. It seems to shift at will from satisfying big ass sippin' IIPA, to a very drinkable but potent brew concealing the 11% abv quite well. Cheers to Southern Tier for a fine brew."
