"Wow, what a beer! Appearance is a large, fluffy, foamy, off-white head that lasts a long time, lots of lace, and a clear light yellow color. Aromas are fresh hops, fresh baked bread, malt, a little fruit. Flavor's are similar to nose, perfect balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Excellent body. Slight medicinal aftertaste from hop. Super easy drinking beer."

"Wow. Blows other DIPAs away. So crisp for 9%."
"Tastes ok. Has pulp floating around in it. Tastes very citrusy."
""
""
"Flavor: Seemed a bit too hopped for me at first sip, like many DIPAs, but I quickly adjusted to what now seemed like a rather well balanced flavor with only moderate bitterness. Still, this will not appeal to people who are not fond of hops. Very good complexity with clear notes of tropical and citrus fruits, most notably the tropical fruits."
"I love this beer. I work at a beer store and bought a four pack. Finished it assuming that we'd be getting more, but no. It was sold out in a day. So piney and delicious, I'll never make that mistake again."
"Good imperial IPA. Not usually me thing but it's  good."

"The beer is ever so slightly cloudy, making one think of lemon juice. The head is relatively high and strikingly white. It recedes slowly, with minimal lacing, but the beer nonetheless appears viscous on the glass. There's an aroma full of the promise of grapefruit; so...here's hoping. But, alas, the expectation of a citrus bomb goes unrequited. What we have here is an anonymous, restrained bitterness. It has a certain piquancy, and it goes down well, but the aromatic volatility of essence of grapefruit rind that one sometimes longs for in a high-powered IPA is missing. The beer's texture is nonetheless satisfyingly rich. It's a good beer, but didn't meet my (perhaps eccentric) citric expectations."

"Great at first but horrible finish"
"O- Really good and crisp, really screams summertime to me - could get one in trouble for sure lol."
"O- Solid DIPA, it certainly fits within the archetype of a good DIPA, but I would have liked a bit more hoppy goodness to balance out the overall sweetness here."
""
""
""

"Creamy mouth feel for an IPA."

"Great beer. Highly recommend it."
"I was really hoping to like this. I guess I do like it, but not enough to seek it out. Victory just doesn't match my palate. I was off of Victory until I finally tried a Dirt Wolf. At least they have one beer that I like a lot."
"Overall-  first off this beer isn't shabby by any means but I think their dirtwolf chews it up and pisses all over it. I appreciate single malt ipa's a lot being a complete hop head. the light pilsner malt should showcase the hops but the bitterness and the alcohol just throws a shadow over the hoppy taste which is a bummer.  if you're a brewer this beer is spot on from the description on ingredients from their website. I wish they threw more mosaic for flavor and aroma,  not being a huge fan of the hipster (tropical) hops (pineapple, mango, lemon) and more from the classic( grapefruit and pine) this one isn't for me."
""
"Pours a beautiful clear gold with limited head but nice lacing. The aroma is also light but with nice tropical fruit notes. The taste is also light with the same characteristics as the aroma but not quite as robust. The body is also light in weight with just a hint of carbonation on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"taste: much like the nose though the citrus thing is up front with a little sweet while the finish is decidedly grapefruit, bitter, and dry."
""
"Some DIPAs blast bitterness upon beer-drinkers to the extent that bitterness becomes the very core of the flavor profile. While I adore such palate abusers, that is not this beer's approach, and it works wonders in its own way, heaping forth a menagerie of gymnosperm and angiosperm-derived brilliance."
"A very good beer and if it wasn't for DirtWolf this would be my favorite Victory brew - an excellent choice but if I have to choose, lobo de tierra for me"
"My local bottle shop was trying to move these, so had them priced the same as Dirtwolf, one of my favorite Double IPAs. It's a great beer, but I can't help feeling that it's inferior to Dirtwolf and a touch redundant. I mean, this is a DIPA at 9% and Dirtwolf is 8.7 I think. It's a little sweet for my liking, but is ingenious for a midwinter release in the Northeast. On the whole, I don't think it stands out too much among Victory's world class offerings, and lacks that extra something/ punch I hoped for."
""
""
"Pours yellow with an orange tint, bubbles rising, slight sediment, and an off white head.  Aroma offers grapefruit, mango, lime, grass, and slight cracker.  Flavor follows suit with a nice decent bitter finish. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, great stuff here.  I actually might prefer this to Dirtwolf to be honest, quite the feat."
"So how to rate this beer?  It delivers everything that an """Imperial""" IPA should, sans the bitter punch and late raspy/resinous finish, the alcohol slap, and the overall palate-wrecking voluminosity. There are no defects of any sort (although I would like to see just a little more bristle in the mouthfeel), and in fact it's a really well-rounded and highly polished beer. What's not to love? But on top of that it's also quite unique, and innovative. Clearly a winner, and one that really needs to be sampled, any fan of hoppy beers needs to check it out!"

"Chill hazed golden body with a thin frothed head.  Intense hop aroma: floral, citric, funky.  Tastes of sweet pale malts up front.  Citrus is more prominent with some floral and overripe fruit.  Smooth body with light bubbles.  Excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Following a Hop Devil this proved to be the better Victory.  Golden with a white head, strong nose of grapefruit, pine, and florals.  Flavor is citrusy with pine and herbal bitters.  Nicely carbonated, a proper west coast style IPA."
"These guys are underrated. They continually impress with voluptuously hoppy offerings. Puts Stone to shame in my opinion."

""

"I might have gotten an old bottle.  Very little hop character in this.  It was very yeasty.  So much so that I was wondering if it had been brewed with Belgian yeast.  Pours cloudy and tasted somewhat thin and reminded me of a hefe.  Overall, a mediocre IPA."
""
"F: Good body.  Not to heavy but not water."
""
""
""
""
"Body is a little thin and well carbed so it drinks easy.  Alcohol well covered with good depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow hue, head was short lived, lots of floaties from bottle conditioning.  Smells of lemon, peach, pine and a pungent herbally dankness!  Tasty hop flavors of lemon and peach with a grapefruit peel bitter finish that is on the dry side.  Good feel here.  Almost creamy?  This is a yummy DIPA here."
"Overall a very tasty beer and another winner from Victory. This is like a fresh hop harvest IPA released in the middle of winter, which is a real treat."
""
""
"Huge citrus notes and a bold mouth mosaic hops are subtle"
""
""
""
""
""

"golden like color with fluffy white head and some yeast residue, smells of hops and yeast, tastes very clean and has a nice hoppy kick to it, slight carbonation…a very good DIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice aroma, good hoppy finish, not as good as Snakehandler, Hopslam, and others."
""
"Overall:  Excellent beer that is better the fresher it is (hope that doesn't sound snobby), but if you buy this one, I recommend drinking it immediately."
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head.  Aroma is of perfume hops, bready malt and peaches.  Body is medium and crisp.  Taste is similar to aroma.  Finish is long, dry, with some alcohol.  Delicious brew."

"9% ABV sneaks up on you."
"The beer poured a crystal clear light straw with a decent white head that left good lacing.  The aroma was sweet and juicy tropical fruits with some grassy almost pilsner qualities.  The flavor is where the Hop Ranch takes over your palate.  Bursting with big beautiful tropical fruits on the front end thanks to the Mosaic hops this is a beast out of the gate.  The flavor slowly evolves into a floral earthy sharpness that mimics a Pilsner on the back end and coats your tongue with a wonderful bitterness. The tropical fruitiness of this brew made it for me and while I was quickly downing my glass I realized how well the abv was hidden.  A great beer from top to bottom."
"O: it's been so long since ive had dirtwolf that it's hard to compare the two. I really enjoyed it. Now that I've said that, I can compare it to enjoy by which I have had recently. Good stuff."
""
""
""

"On tap at novare. It's lighter than I expected. Pretty though. When the head dissipates it looks like a French sauternes or something. Aroma is a little funky, a little cheesy, and tropical. Taste: hop resin and stuff that's orange. pineapple and a Tang, the astronaut drink. Where's the malt? Can't believe this is 9%. On the tongue, it's thinnish and well carbonated, but has an oily quality that's kind of cool. Finish is both sweet and bitter. I'm a fan of doubles that aren't all malt-clunky to counter the hops. This is really nice."
""
"Mouthfeel is good, there's a long lingering flavor however the weight itself seems very light on the tongue.  It has a complementary carbonation level, it tickles your mouth enough without being over carbonated.  Nice light feel without much of a bite from the carbonation or the alcohol.  I mentioned before it's sort of like hop juice, but it's such an amazing combination of what's going on just from the hops, goes sweet than leads to a a dry bitter finish, very clean.  Crazy drinkable beer, especially for the style, would prefer it in the summer though.  Great beer, another good beer from Victory.  I think I like Dirt Wolf a little better, but Hop Ranch is very good in it's own right."
"Very deceptive strength for a 9% abv brew. I much prefer this over Hop Wallop. There's better balance here. I'd like to try this next to Dirt Wolf. Will buy again."

"Pour from 12oz into tulip. Pours a hazy golden-orange with a short white head. Haze clarifies pretty quickly as the beer comes to temp. Nose is very floral and tropical. Taste is mirror of nose, with a nice balance of bitter-to-malt for the IIPA style. There is a blast of booze in the finish, but not unwelcome.  The combo of floral and tropical (some have noted citrus, I didn't get that in my taste) is very well blended and makes a great hop forward flavor combo. I prefer a touch more linger on the palate than this offered, but this is a solid offering."
""
""
"Tasty big IPA. Pours a dark gold, mostly clear color into a pint glass. Big white head with average retention.  Aroma is very good with floral and citrus hops.  Taste is the best aspect. Nice and bitter with a little bit of balancing malt.  The hops are somewhat floral and also  a big citrus component- nice and bitter with a bit of dry biscuity malt for balance. Mouthfeel is crisp  and rich with little alcohol presence. A good DIPA.  I would happily drink this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could feel some warming as I made my way through this but this was nowhere near as strong as the more potent Imperial IPA's that I've had before. The carbonation was decent but the malt base wasn't and this just seemed a bit overwhelming from start to finish. While not a bad choice, this was not as alluring as the Dirt Wolf or as memorable as stronger and more flavorful Imperial IPA's that I've enjoyed. A good offering from Victory that will satisfy their followers and most hopheads but just a bit lacking when it came to the lasting factor."

"The aroma is fantastic.  Really citrusy smell.  The taste was a big let down after the wonderful smell of the beer.  The bottle also had large particles floating in the bottom.  Pretty disgusting looking.  I drank it anyway.  Decent IPA but the taste just doesn't live up to the aroma."
""
""
""
"This beer was all over the place.  The look was a clear yellow pilsner/lager  with a white head that dissipated quickly.  I could not find hops on the nose.  the smell of a bitter lager was present.  The taste was sweet and more lager than hoppy, that being said, I did like it quite a bit.  Feel was smooth.  Beer is a very good beer, but hard for me to find the IPA elements that I would look for."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz into my Spiegelau. Pale amber hue (I hear they use all pils malt), and about 1/2 finger of quickly dissipating, loose white bubbles. Did not get the big citrus, etc that the description/other reviewers got at all. Maybe a hint on the nose and the palate, but the dominant aromas in my opinion were of the earthy/resiny variety. I got a really dank (almost cheesy; in a good way) note on the nose that overpowered anything in the 'citrus' spectrum. There was a distinct bitterness on the nose (not unlike DirtWolf) where with a big deep huff you can actually feel it in your eyes (if you have tried this, you know what I mean). Huge up-front bitterness on the palate, with lots of nice, dank goodness, pine actually came through on the back of the palate. This was not a usual (fruit juice) IIPA for me, and that is actually something I like. Light mouthfeel for a pretty big beer. No noticeable alcohol burn, etc. Hint of an oily, lingering quality of the mouthfeel that allowed the flavors to hang around for a few moments (pine dominated here, though the resiny notes were around too). This beer made me think. I thought about hops (and all of the characteristics that different varieties bring to the party), I thought about my palate (and why some reviewers are getting different aromas/flavors dominating), and I thought about why I enjoy tasting and reviewing beers so much. I don't often get that with a standard profile IIPA. Victory consistently makes me think about what I am tasting. Not too many other breweries can do that (Upper Hand also comes to mind). Cheers BAs! UPDATE: This was very different on draft. DID get tons of big citrus and tropical notes... nice, dry finish with juiciness throughout. Easily a 4 all-around on draft."

"This beer looks like a pils and smells like one too just with some mild pine to liven it up. The taste is good but the flavors come off artificial, not very appealing. The best thing about this beer is the mouth feel, for 9% its light and actually refreshing."
""
""
""
"Don't like the smell, but the taste far out ways it!"
"Straw colored with a touch of golden hue, small white head and minimal lacing.  Citrus, tropical and herbal aromas in abundance.  Citrus up front and tropical through the middle with a slight herbal finish.  This might be the first beer where I get noticeable pineapple with mango supporting and a herbal touch at the end.  Bright carbonation, thinner feel and slightly dry on the finish.  How can a 9% ABV beer be refreshing?  This one pulls it off, great DIPA!"
""
""
"O: A real stinker. It's done in by its failed effort to play the artificial citrus bitterness against the overpowering caramel sweetness. Funny those two wrongs didn't make a right. Loved the mouthfeel, though."

"At least for me, I think I like this better than the other DIPA's I've had from Victory (hop wallop and dirt wolf).  Nice beer."
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Enjoy by 24 May 2015 printed on the label.  Pours a bright honey gold with a slight haze to the clarity and a loose, quarter inch bright white head.  Nose is a bit subdued - citrus peel and some light earthy/herbal aromatics with a hint of tangerine towards the back.  Taste consistent with nose.  I'm really not all that blown away by the flavor profile - a bit on the simple side.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation just shy of prickly and a light acidity that stimulates the back of the tongue.  Overall, decent but nothing to write home about.  Alcohol is extremely well-hidden but I'm quite surprised by the high ratings."

"Straw / faint yellow appearance with a fast breaking one finger head. There is some small pieces of junk in the bottom of my glass - I presume this is an unfiltered beer which is cool. Smells great - lots of juicy tropical fruits such as grapefruit, pineapple and orange. Taste is complex, dank and bright all at the same time with earthy pine, orange and grapefruit flavors. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer that has a lively, fresh taste to it that keeps you coming back for more. Highly recommended."

"Semi hazy light pale yellow body. Didn’t have much head. Wonderful pineapple floral aroma. Wow is this good. Lots of pineapple sweet taste. Excellent!"
""
"O-Wow, this beer really surprised me. I have not been a huge Victory fan, but this may change my mind. This beer manages to balance fruity, tropical hop notes with more earthy hop notes (without giving me the onion flavor that I have noticed in other Victory beers), all the while balancing the hops against the malt bill very nicely. One of the better IIPAs I have had in a while. I will be looking for more of this."
"Did not like anything about this beer to be honest."
""
"Overall, this is just a real nice beer. It isn’t overly thick or aggressive. Perfect balance of bitterness, citrus, malt, and carbonation. I would pair it with a shrimp ceviche with tropical fruits mixed in like mango and papaya. I really wouldn’t change much about this beer, but If I had to, I would say just a kiss more carbonation, but really it’s not even required. I give it a 97/100"
"Shockingly, Very reminiscent of Heady. Pleasant surprise, stoked I was able to pick up a 4-pack."

"Beautiful, champagne effervescent golden straw colour. Sweet florals with tropical fruits aromas and taste. Great light, carbonated mouth feel. Great effort from Victory!!!"
""
""
""
""
"I great offering from Victory.  Light straw colored body with a sticky bouquet of floral and juicy tropical fruits, white grape, sweet tarts, glassy and citrus.  This beer is all about the hops without tongue numbing bitterness."

""
""
"The palate opens with a fruity and floral blend of jasmine, melon, grapes, citrus (navel oranges, some grapefruit), lemon verbena  and a touch of lemon mint, Creamy on the palate with soft, supple carbonation, this beer is medium-light in carbonation. The mid-palate continues to focus on the fruity aspects, deemphasizing the bitterness. The finish is mildly oily, mildly resiny and mostly fruity with a moderate bitterness, bright and refreshing. A shade grassy towards the finish. Almost west coast like in execution, this is fantastic stuff. ."

"O: This is a top notch IPA. Most east coast IPAs tend to be a bit too sweet/malty for my hophead tastes, but this one breaks through. Put Hop Ranch up there there with the best west coast IPA's, this one is a champ!"
"This beer is really good. Great hops in this!"

"Taste: Tropical hops explosion in a lush, drinkable, and well-balanced setting, especially for the ABV. Even the wife, upon tasting blindly, remarked at how light it seemed. Tastes as refreshing and light as a session IPA, but with a 9% ABV level, this one’s very deceptive and sneaky. Tangy, fruity, and absolutely delicious. Will buy again, yes."
"such a delicious big boy ipa, packed with a mosaic fruitiness and a simcoe oily property, not sure if those are the varietals used or not, but this beer exhibits very similar properties to both. very blonde beer, honey colored and clear with a nice white head. the nose is just dripping with fruity oily hops, and the grain base interferes little, despite the abv. the flavor too is a hop explosion, as fresh and as vibrant as any i can recall. notes of grapefruit, tangerine, cut lawn, and even green grape are all there for me, and the finish still comes on nice and bitter. the malt base never makes much contribution, as the body is light, appreciably dry, and leaving only a slight hop stickiness there after the swallow. fresh is the word that keeps coming to mind for me on this one. the alcohol can be felt but not at all tasted. i love this, even more that dirtwolf i think, one of the best east coast india pale ales ive had in some time."
"OVERALL:  I don’t know if this one is better than Dirt Wolf, but at the very least its close.  I will reach for this again."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange, with a nice fluffy off-white three finger head. Great retention and lacing. Smell is big citrus, with orange and grapefruit, along with some tropical mango and pineapple notes. Didn't get much malt in the smell or the taste. The taste was very grapefruity up front, with some orange and pineapple notes. The mouthfeel was kind of flat, seemed to be missing some body, with very light carbonation. This is once again a great beer from Victory, I'm glad we can find them here in Colorado."

"very fruity DIPA, restrained sweetness, mild tropical citrus and hints of apple and pear. supremely drinkable with the alcohol hidden. the delicate ying to dirtwolf's brazenly dank yang"
""
"For the love of Pete...  Loads of citrusy oranges and pineapple here with a hefty dose of booze...  Drinks lighter than I was expecting...  Cracker malts sure try to make a presence but they are overwhelmed by the sheer onslaught of hops...  Not sure I could drink more than one at a time due to the bigness of it but this is super delicious..."
"O: Very good DIPA here.  Victory is a damn consistent brewery.  Well done.  4.25"
"Overall:  Another outstanding pilsner malt-based, newer hop blend Double IPA.  Right up there with Victory Dirtwolf and Lagunitas Sucks.  Not quite at the same level of complexity as Stone Enjoy By."

"Overall - I was okay with this at first, but after it warmed up for about half an hour it really impressed me. Solid example of the style and very orange-centric. Probably the most orange juice tasting DIPA I have had. Thought that was unique and cool."
"Very fresh bottle that just missed the mark entirely. Aroma was all over the place, none of it a good place though. Almost sour malt, the hop combo just not pleasant at all, partly for its weakness as much as its poor accord. Palate wasn't much better, some astringent hoppiness, extremely little actual hop flavor, overly full malt feel. Bad batch? Perhaps, as freshness wasn't an issue. Needless to say, highly doubt I'll revisit."
"Looks like a Budweiser but definitely doesn't taste like one"
""
""
""
""
"Really light in color. Great aroma, light and drinkable for a DIPA. Does not taste like a 9% beer. Low bitterness, high on hop flavor. Lots of citrus and nothing like Dirtwolf in my opinion. Good stuff."
"Same price as Dirtwolf, limited availability. Tastes like dirtwolf if they forgot a hop or two. Ok the end, buy Dirtwolf! Disappointed."

"Not a huge fan, I don't like the resin aftertaste"

"Gorgeous pour with slight haze and bottle sediment at the bottom.  Nice creamy off-white head.  Nose gives me a delightful mix of fruity aromas, and I continually think of melons, melon rind, and perhaps some peach.  Nice, full creamy body on the palate with light candied malt offset by big tropical hoppy flavors.  Finish is long with a little boozy bite at the end."
"I live 10 minutes from Victory and would get different variations of their ranch series on tap every now and then.  I'm so glad they finally decided to bottle one of them.  This is a great, big beer."
""
"Overall: As with Dirtwolf, this is one hell of a IIPA. This one has more of a peppery/onion undertone. Has the perfect spice for winter without going overboard. However, like Dirtwolf, its a bit light in taste and aromas to be among my absolute favorites (Enjoy By, Head Hunter). Id rather have a DirtWolf any day of the week, but this is a good local seasonal and for under $40 a case, you cannot go wrong."
""
""
""
"A great beer. This beer is so different than other IIPAs that I hesitate to put it in the same category. It's more of an imperial pilsner to my palate, but I like that. Azacca hops are hard to describe, so this one is really a must taste in order to determine if you'll like it or not. Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very balanced between the light, biscuity pilsner malt, the juicy mosiac, and the lightly grassy and green onion notes of the azacca hop. doesn't taste or feel 9%. one of the most well-rounded imperial ipas i've had in a long while. fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"They really got this hop balance right, for me. Onion, grapefruit, earthy. Yes, all I want from an IPA with an aroma that projects at least five feet away from the glass. In my opinion, when you try this from a bottle you have not tasted it yet. I did not like it in the bottle last year, but this years draft rules."
"Overall: As much as people have talked this beer up to me over the last year, I was disappointed. Victory and I have a tempestuous relationship. Sometimes I love them and sometimes they just fall short. This one is on the fall short category. Personally I would rather have Dirt Wolf or Hop Devil."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden orange body with two finger head that dies quick and leaves lace patches.  Classic citric, spicy hop aroma with hints of sweet malts.  Smooth, light-bodied, citric hop taste profile with spicy finish and just enough sweetness to keep it balanced and prevent it from being overly dry/bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Golden color. Funky smell. Very bitter. Not bad balance for a 9% beer. Alcohol present but not overpowering"
""
""
""
"O: once again, another one of Victory's strong IPAs shines... I've always loved the German approach to their construction... too bad I didn't buy another bottle - a lovely brew"
"This is a damn delicious DIPA. Fruity, juicy, unique, balanced, and well crafted. Just when you think everyone has done everything that can be done with IPA in all its forms, this one comes around and impresses me. Beer of the year so far for 2015."

"BBD 5/24/15.  Pours a clear light amber (golden).  However, the bottom of the bottle pour produces a some flocculants.  Normal head volume, lacing and slightly below normal retention.  Nice nose of sweet blended tropical fruit over a light orange rind note.  Light medium body with a good bit of oiliness to the texture. Well carbonated with a good effervescence in the middle and more in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense (hop flavor forward), extremely well balanced and complex.  It begins with an effervescent burst of blended hop flavor (tropicals such as mango, pineapple, but never really separates).  This flows into a moderate bitterness in the middle that contains a slight pepper note.  As the bitterness fades, a biscuit sweetness emerges with hints of orange.  The finish is a slow fade into a lingering orange zest flavor bitterness and a slight nice alcohol warming at the back of the throat."
"This strikes me as a pretty unusual IIPA. Very light in color, and doesn't drink at all like its 9% abv. The flavor reminds me strongly of a white wine—and not in that NZ-hopped winey way."

"Surprisingly bright and clear yellow, like a light lager. Nothing stands out to me on this one. I think I prefer Dirt Wolf over this."
""
"The flavor is good but it's held back by a waxy texture and bitter feel. I get some nice fruit flavor like oranges, limes, perfumey hop cone, light herbal notes, lupilin, honey, very little malt, lemon and pine."
"Hop forward beer. Great taste on this one."
""
""
"It's more bitter and biting at the finish than I'd prefer, but I love the accompanying sweetness and hop fruit character."
""
"Great after taste. Reminds me of citra by flying dog."
""
"I would avoid this one.  Dirtwolf is way better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel - Very light.  If not for the burn of alcohol you may not know it was there at all.  The light mouthfeel contributes to a drinkability that makes this very dangerous at 9%.  4.5 paws."
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised by this beer. 9.0% but not boozy at all. Nice citrusy hop character, and a beautiful golden color. Smell is a bit """meh," especially given the potent hops. A smooth, tasty beer that I will definitely get again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I remember this being more fruity and over the top hoppy now it tastes more bready and more like a pilsner. I think in a month of so this beer might actually be better than it is now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, not as good as past years releases though"
""
""
"Overall, not my kind of hop profile."
"Earthy, not overly bitter.  Very drinkable for the abv"
""
""
"Medium-bodied, but trending dry, bitter and with absolute cleansing properties. A touch of alcohol hides behind the hops and offer a mild acetone spice. Lingering with sassafras tea, sprucy hops and dried fruit peel, the beer begs for quicker drinks than a nine-percent beer should."
""
""
""
""
"Had three or four if these over a few days before rating. Overall very good. Similar to founders harvest with just a tad of a dry alcohol heat at the finish that makes it very slightly imbalanced. But good shit and at $45 per case a real bargain."
""
"Not a good beer,taste like golden monkey with hops. Not a good combo"
""
""
""
"Very nice - lighter than expected color/mouthfeel. Pine and citrus. Nice beer."
"Between this and dirtwolf, victory is slaying the hops right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a terrific beer and I'll purchase again each time I see it.  $10 per four pack is a great value too. I prefer this one over Dirtwolf, which I love as well.  Get some."
""
""
"O: Victory is killing it right now with IPAs.  Wish this was year-round with Dirtwolf."
""

"Very little aroma. Mostly just bitter."

"tastes like a very fresh, hoppy light beer"

"This beer has a golden/yellow pour out of the bottle with strong hop and citrus smell. The taste mimics the awesome smell and the beer has decent lacing. The mouthfeel is smooth with small bite in the after taste. Overall I like this beer very much, I raise my pint to victory once again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the last bottle from the case I bought in Jan, 2014, and somehow I’ve neglected to review it. IMHO this is a much better beer than Dirtwolf, certainly having more flavor and a less noticeable hop profile. This could easily be a session beer."

"#1 - 12 oz. pour off tap @ Friendly Ice House (San Antonio, TX) on 16-Apr-14"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; a very tasty, crisp, very drinkable IPA, would definitely buy again."
""
"The head on this ale is excellent, whipped stark white foam and very voluminous above a yellow gold body. Flavor is very creamy mixed with some bitter hop flavor and lush citrus fruit. Good but a bit tame for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a glorious and incredibly tasty brew. 4 packs of these don't usually last more than a week here on the shelves in Chicago, so I'm glad to pick this up when I can."
""
""
""
"O: a unique and tropical DIPA that is worth a pack to try. Victory has added another quality IPA to their library"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a flavorful and refreshing DIPA. Really liked it a lot."
""
"Tons of hop flavor and character. Not just bitterness, which I don't enjoy. This is really well made and enjoyable. Outside of a small tasting, I have not had Dirtwolf but this is impressive enough. Which should be expected with Victory."
""
""
"O - Definitely a one-of-a-kind brew. The beer has a lot going for it, some of which I liked, some of which I did not. The pineapple and onion are a bit too strong for my taste. However, it is refreshing to see a great brewery experiment with some left-of-center American hops. Certainly worth trying once."
""
""
""

"O- a nice showcase of floral hops that's pretty drinkable for the ABV"

"As different as IPA can be, I get to use the onion, garlic and perhaps even the cat pee/ ammonia descriptors for hops for the first time in my book. Aroma of this beer is intense and complex, overall a tropical/herbaceous beer that is well brewed but should also come with a disclaimer. My body was not ready."

""
""

""

""
""
""
""

"O: This is delicious but odd and different. I don't know how to classify this, but it really tastes like an Imperial version of a hopped up lager."
""
""
""
"I'm torn between this and the wolf. Head to head, which ever I have first spoils the other. This is a great dbl ipa. Bitter as all hell which i prefer. Barely any sweet maltiness which could help (just a little). Would def have again and again and again..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall solid level of bitterness, yet incredibly drinkable. Pale, dry, with a fresh wet touch on the nose, and at 9.0%abv it drinks more appropiately like a 7.0% at best. Great summer time quencer or a spring hopped beer worthy of multiples and case/keg purchase. Another great addition to thier hop series in conjunction with Dirt wolf which was my latest wow beer, at wow price. Keep'm coming victory."
""
""
"TOTAL - 43/50"
""
""
""
"this isn't my favorite dipa but it wasn't bad. big sweet citrus and some funk, kind of off. the flavor doesn't provide all that, mostly the aroma. flavor has boozey and bitter. can't really give this an A because I preferred hop wallop which was an A- for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Phenomenal beer, an instant favorite. Gotta love the hints of citrus, so pleasing to the nostrils and palate. I bought 2 cases of this after trying it on tap at a local bar. Too bad it is seasonal, I want this year-round. I do happen to like it better than dirt wolf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the more unique Imperial's I'ver ever had the opportunity to taste. Hell, it even goes perfectly with my goat cheese, salami and vienna bread spread! Not something I would go out of my way to acquire, but definitely a solid beer. I'd say at least try it once."
""
"O-I was geeked when I purchased this beer, but it was just not that enjoyable. I've never had an IPA that had such a funky oniony taste and there are too many other great IPA's out there to ever seek this one out again. I typically like Victory, but this was a dud.for me."
"Victory has been taken for granted for a long time. With this and DirtWolf they have recaptured the beer geek attention."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- A very good IPA up there with Jai Alai and Sucks."

""
""
""
""
""

""

"D - Not a hop bomb by any means and that is okay by me... Much more well balanced that I had expected... Quite refreshing and rather quaffable... Goes down easily sip after sip... Hides the 9% ABV exceedingly well... Well played by Victory..."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a citrus bomb and then some. Pours a light orange, clear as a bell - looks like a lager almost. Minimal head and viscous lacing throughout. The nose and taste are fantastic, loads of citrus... each sip delivers something different. It's bright and shiny upfront and finishes with an oil slick of hops. This is a damn good double ipa that hopefully will be brewed again. Grab it if you get a chance, you'll be glad you did. Think I'll have another. Oh, almost forgot to mention, the 9% alcohol is very well masked. Be careful."
"A very fruit forward DIPA that has an interesting malt bill giving it lager qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One helluva fine example of an imperial IPA! Excellent aroma and flavor from the hops put this brew in my """ favorite class""" for sure. Exceptional IPA."
""
"O - I enjoy the fruit, the snappy clean finish, and easy drinkability, but I am not a fan of onions in my beer, and the ammonia smell also was unpleasant. About half a great beer, and the rest not so much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, golden-yellow coloring with a thin, foamy, low profile, bright white head and a ton of carbonation throughout the body. There's some sediment floating throughout, too. Aromas of dank and pungent hops, wet and heavy, with grassy notes, heavy cedar notes, moss, clove and pepper spicing, and a hint of rich apricot sweetness. Very unique nose for the style. Flavors are smooth and balanced forward, with a solid toffee and biscuit backbone supporting a mild bitterness in the background, a heavy dose of wood, moss, and pitch in the forefront, and highlights of citrus fruit and spices. Very heavy and very different. Wow. The body is smooth, and kept very light by the carbonation levels. The aftertaste is surprisingly light, with more of the tart citrus and fruity sweetness coming through, and only hints of grass and forest characteristics. The finish is smooth, light, and slightly crisp, with a hint of dryness across the palate. Heavy, but damn tasty. This is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great DIPA showcasing Mosaic hops. The fruitiness of the hops really comes through well. I had this immediately following a glass of resin, it they are two DIPA's that are similar only in ABV. I found this one refreshing and would certainly have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright yellow with an inch, off-white, frothy head. Smells of tangerine, grapefruit, orange and lemon. Taste is similar to the aroma but can taste a hint of pineapple now and then. Medium body, slightly bitter, goes down smooth. A well crafted IIPA, but not the biggest fan of the flavor profile (prefer Dirt Wolf between the two) Would recommend to others."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured to dogfish mini-pilsner glass. Appearance is golden with tones of yellow..smell is fruity, grapefruit, citrus, apricot..taste is smooth for suggested 9%abv. Starts sweet amd citrus, and finishes fruity, and smooth, """air-ee""" light bodied creamy mouthfeel. Lemon rind and orange peel.,highlights the hop frehness and taste without being too bitter or cloying.. Lacing is foamy and sticky. Carbonation is medium, with a crisp dry feel on the finish..this is refreshing and admirable. Paired nice with kabobs-cucumber yogurt sauce, grilled meat chimmichurri, mexican corn with cotija, feta."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good DIPA certainly a worthy buy."
""
""
"O - This is well done and reminds me of a Toppling Goliath APA or IPA. Glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: FANTASTIC. Never got Dirtwolf down here but this is the opposite of the big DIPAs like Hopslam/Myrcenary/Dreadnaught which are thicker and can be slightly on the boozy side (which I also love). This is just so clean bursting with a freshness. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost bordering on light. This goes down very easily. The carbonation is very active, making the feel even better. Overall, this is a very good DIPA. The light feel makes this go down easily and the wonderful aromas and flavors are impressive."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer a whole lot, just like DirtWolf. Also like DirtWolf, I don't quite love it. Onion, when it's in small doses, can be great (see: Lagunitas Sucks), this just brings it too strongly. On the plus side, I can't tell you how happy I am to see a DIPA on the market not weighed down with excess malt or excess booze."
""
""
"This ale pours a hazy golden color with a very slight white head and decent spiderweb lacing. The nose is incredible. Fresh citrus, pine, peaches, even mangoes and papayas. All the awesome scents a fresh west coast Ipa should have. The taste is a little lighter than the aroma with all the flavors still present but slightly subdued. If Victory could of made the flavors shine in the mouth as much as they did on the nose, this cpuld be the best dipa I've ever had. None the less, it is a great beer and definitely worth trying; if not seeking out."
""
"Overall I am in love with this beer, its not youre everyday Imperial IPA. If youre looking for a sweet not too bitter tropical/stone fruit bomb, here it is!"
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not, especially with a case of Hopslam in the cellar. This beer suffer by comparison."
""
""
"I give Victory a great deal of credit for this beer. This is not like 99% of the imperial DIPAs out there. Extremely pale yellow color - different citrus aromas and taste. It won't be for everyone - disagree completely with any comparison to Hopslam - I know a Michigan Bell's fan that would kill for Hopslam that hates this beer. After producing Dirtwolf - Victory went in a completely 180 degree opposite direction - love it as a contrast to the orange color hop dominated IPAs which I also love."
""
"O - A different smelling and tasting DIPA for sure. Well made for sure. Complex flavors for sure. My favorite cup of tea? No."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is my #1 beer as of tonight (the first time I tried it). I can't say enough good things about it. In comparing with DirtWolf I rate this beer much higher. For me DirtWolf had a boozie taste to it which I did not like (but DirtWolf is still a great beer)."
""
"Overall, it was an excellent beer. Would I feel sad if I wasn't able to find it again next year? Probably not. Would I buy it again? Sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer ! Great job Victory ! I would really like a chance to do a blind taste test between this and Hopslam. Careful with this one people . . . Drinks like a 6% ipa rather than a 9% iipa."
""
""
""
"O- Everyone seems to be in love with this beer but I'm really going back and forth on it. One thing I'll give it though is it hides it's ABV extremely well. Hoping to catch this on tap and see if I like it any better."
""
""
"Is there anything better than having a beer with no expectations & having it blow your tiny little brain to pieces with yummy? This beer kicks ass: you just don't find many IIIPAs with the combo of bitterness AND taste. What's so hard about that? One of the best new IIPAs I've had in a while. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lighty foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5) mouthfeel that works for the beer and is within style limits. Ethanol barely perceived on the palate, primarily as a light heat in the nostrils and faint burn on the palate and back of throat. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness remaining on the palate."
""
"The beer pours a vigorous and foamy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a lot of nice lacing while leaving a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a clear pale gold color. The beer has a nice honey smell with strong floral hops as well as hints of pepper. Additionally, there are hints of light pine resin as well as slightly bready malt notes. The beer taste has a slight bready malt backbone but the main notes appear to be honey and grapefruit. In addition, there are slight floral tastes and notes of pine resin with pepper. The mouthfeel is pretty light for DIPA. The beer has a crisp feel with its light carbonation and smooth feel with a medium body. Overall, a fantastic DIPA and worth getting again."
""
""
"O) In 5 simple words... One hell of a brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hop Ranch delivers the Mosaic Hops just the way I wanted. Did not let me down at all."
"O - along with DFH 90 min, this Is right up there with my favorite DIPA's. I LOVE this beer. It has a unique flavor that enhances its drinkability unlike any other I've come across to date. Victory has a winner in this one...would love to find this on draft somewhere in the Baltimore area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best Imperial IPAs I've had. I don't know if we can expect this to be part of Victory's regular lineup or just a seasonal offering. Either way, more IPAs should be designed this way. The punch-in-the-face impact of the fruit hop aroma, high ABV, and easy drinkablility makes this a great beer to look forward to after a long day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really an slam dunk must have DIPA - love the fresh hop forward and juicy hop bomb."
""
"Overall I like this a little bit more than I like Dirt Wolf."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is golden with a huge, fluffy white head. The aroma offers dank hops, oranges and assorted citrus. Toast and biscuits with orange juice. Juicy and resinous with a bitter finish. Some pine notes and sourdough bread. Well balanced with a leaning toward hops. Tasty beer."
""
""
"O-Overall a great DIPA. Alcohol content not immediately evident. Very crisp and clean would pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Yes! This beer is absolutely incredible. It has a very unique flavor profile. Not overly sweet like some other IPA's, not too bitter or piney, the alcohol is hidden well, and dat mouthfeel. Love it."
""
"O- overall this beer is dynamic. its a great DIPA from Victory in a era where the more hops the better seems to be the culture. this one really sets a standard in my opinon as far as sublte complexities that run hand and hand with the strong hop Notes. its a incredible beer and the more beers i have been reviewing the lower my scores have been, only because i belive brewers are really upping the game and setting incredible standards, so the fact i gave this a 4.25 is relative to this beer being a gem."
""
""
"Would definitely get again, this was great."
""
"Not exactly what I was expecting after reading other reviews, and loving dirtwolf. It wasn't bad by any means, but far from outstanding. Lots of tropical fruit and citrus in this beer, but there was something strange I couldn't quite put my finger on. Almost reminded me of a fruity champagne or carbonated Chardonnay. I will say for 9% abv this beer was very light. Over all pretty good, easy to drink considering the abv. But far from great."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma was quite off-putting for me. Dank & catty. But I know some hops smell this way (Simcoe?) Still, made it hard for me to enjoy completely. The color is somewhat light for an imperial, and the flavor is at least better than the aroma. I personally liked Victory's DirtWolf much better. Bought a 4 pack of this, will have to pawn it off to my buddies or just grin & bear it. Wouldn't care to get this again. It's just not what I like."
""
""
""
""
"I have to say Victory has been on its game lately Dirtwolf and now Hop Ranch their Imperial IPA is right on target. Amazing aroma of tropical fruit, and citrus, taste is right on more tropical fruit, citrus, slight pine and a bit resiny. The sticky resiny flavor really comes through in the backbone with slight malt sweetness to round out this huge IPA extremely drinkable for such a big beer, absolutely delicious!"
""
""
"O - This beer drinks easy in comparison to other imperial IPA's. Has a nice danky hop profile to it with a orange citrus bite. A must try for any serious IPA lover, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent IPA from victory. Very unique. I'm loving these recent IPAs they've been pumping out, hope to see more soon as there right up there with some of the best from the west coast. I'm having a hard time choosing a favorite between this and dirtwolf."
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent offering from Victory and to be quite honest I think this is far better than DirtWolf. It's cleaner tasting, has more of a bite to it with its hop profile and fruity, citrus flavors are a bit more pronounced. I will be a repeat customer of this for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hop Ranch reminds me a lot of Hop Wallop. Nice mix of hoppy flavors-grass and citrus mix was my favorite thing about Wallop, so I'm glad it's still around with Hop Ranch. I prefer this one over DirtWolf."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Victory is killing it lately, another great one here."

"Overall (4.5/5): Hop Ranch is an excellent Imperial/Double IPA, that has a lot of great characteristics–the nose is full of citrus and tropical fruit notes, the taste, full of orange, peach, and pineapple-like hop character, and the finish is pleasantly drying. There's a nice sweetness that balances out the initial astringence and makes it quite a pleasure to drink. I think it's a distinct beer, and have enjoyed it more than Victory's other, very successful big IPA, DirtWolf. Definitely a great beer that shows off the unique hop characteristics of Azacca and Mosaic."
"This is a light to medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A nice, unique offering that is easy drinking. I would certainly have this one again. Thank you Matt for sharing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid, very bold  double IPA with a unique flavor profile and made specifically for hop lovers."
""
""
"Bottom Line: What was that!!!!"
""
""
"Overall: Another solid new DIPA from Victory. This one is a little simpler than DirtWolf (IMO), but it is highly enjoyable. Feel and the aroma are the highlights of this beer. [3.75/5.0]"
"O: Not my favorite from Victory but a very respectable offering. Can't wait to see what they come out with next."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really tasty, one of my favorite double IPA's."
"Overall not bad, nice balance of very tasty hops, nice malts, and hint of booze, until the finish just smacks your tongue with hops. Nice overall beer though too, tasty, drinkable, at least when it's very fresh. Not a huge fan of the appearance though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid take on an Imperial IPA. Big tropical fruit presence with a solid Pils Malt presence. Its almost like Prima Pils on Steroids."
"An outstanding beer that eclipses Dirtwolf in terms of accessibility. Perhaps less bold in flavor than its imperial IPA counterpart, but Hop Ranch delicately balances notes of white citrus, grapefruit and grape and touts a very easy-drinking palate at 9%. The smell and taste almost reminds me of an imperial version of Schafly's excellent Tasmanian IPA. It has a similar slight sort of funk, but one that is wholly enjoyable and a wonderful contribution to the clean citrus prominence."
"Hop Ranch is a great addition to the Victory lineup. I will be enjoying these, as long as they stay around. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Hop Ranch could well be the go-to IIPA of choice for those who love hop flavor but don't like bitterness. To me, this beer's a touch too sweet. The flavor of this brew is so nice though, that I'd very gladly have it again. At the same time, I wouldn't quite call this a World Class sort of Imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Darn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This was a fairly good beer, but it suffers some with me as the hop profile just isn't my favorite. I don't think it's nearly as good an offering from Victory as DirtWolf. Still, another solid brew from them."
"Pours into a standard pint a clear dull yellow with a tightly formed one finger white head,the pour was not real awe inspiring by any means.Tropical fruits in the nose along with a bit of sweet onion,very fresh and juicy smelling.Flavors of grapefruit and mango are just dripping,almost like drinking mixed fruit juice,in the finish I pick up some vidalia onion,not much of a malt presence but a decent amount of sugary sweetness.This is a big fruity,juicy hopped IPA here,way to easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/24/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of citrus/tropical hops and a light-moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big mango, peach, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops with light-moderate malt balance; with a nice crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA. Great complexity of bright hop flavors with a light-moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: This DIPA is a very good beer, don't get me wrong, and I am sure it will have it's followers for its exotic hops varieties and exceptionally unique aromas and flavors. There is nothing remotely wrong with this beer aside from the slightly sweet flavor in the finish, which may be due to the berry-melon character of the hopping. I would still rather take an """old school""" DIPA like Pliny, Lagunitas Sucks, or even Victory Dirtwolf any day."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with big dense white head, settles slowly to a thin layer, rings of thick lace down the glass. Smell: muted lemon peel, grass, nectarine. Taste: pineapple, citrus, grass; backing is white grape and unripe pear. Tongue numbing but sticky sweet. Doesn't do it for me, but semi interesting. Oh, and seems Victory's still at it with their date codes. Call it """Hop Ranch""" and date it 6 months out. The Anti-Enjoy By."

"Sweet fruitiness up front, sweet candied fruit. Malt adds a faintly syrupy body, finishes explodes with fruity hop flavor, amazing bright, medium bodied, absolutely no alcohol detection, bitterness is mild, just enough to balance the brew. Leaves the mouth watering. Didn't know it was possible to top dirt wolf but this beer is simply fantastic"

"O: Strangely for a beer that I describe as having a light cat piss smell and taste, this is actually a pretty enjoyable beer that really grows on you. Nice amounts of complexity and the alcohol is pretty well hidden considering the strength."
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer is really a tossup between its aroma and its flavoring. The nose is fresh and full of that glorious mosaic fruitiness, but it mixes with this down-to-earth grit that makes it memorable. The sip, on the other hand, gives you this explosive yet tamable flavoring that again, showcases the uniqueness of the hops, but also shows how interesting you can make the base of the beer as well. Having tried both the R and the S tester batches of this beer over the past couple years it has been interesting watching and being present for this final product’s genesis. While they are each different recipes, they demonstrate the type of heartiness that can go into a DIPA without making it overly dark, overly caramel, or overly heavy. Although they went with the mosaic hop, something that might be a bit unconventional, they still execute a highly commercial beer with wide appeal. They also keep it juicy and tough enough for someone looking for something a bit more complex to dissect. This is a fantastic beer across all categories, except for maybe feel which is a bit ambiguous at times. Either way, this beer, especially since it is following Dirtwolf, is further evidence of the great things that Victory is doing with hops these day."
""
""
""
""
"O- Between this and Dirtwolf, Victory is nailing IIPAs. Lots of great tropical fruit flavors from the hops."
"Bottle from Tipples. Can't see the date but I assume relatively fresh. Pours clear and golden with a giant fluffy white head. Sweet aroma of lemon peel, dankness, honey, pale malts, funky grass. This almost has a farmhouse/brett aroma but then the hops really take over. Flavor is sweet lemony hops with some light pine and lots of grassiness, very light sweetness from the malts in the background. Very smooth and low to medium bitter for the style. Medium mouthfeel, resinous, but surprisingly light for a double IPA! Hard to believe this is 9%. Could be dangerous. Very nice brew."
"I learn, for me, this needs to come up in temperature to fully appreciate the complexity this quaff has to offer. Also noting that the higher abv is undetectable yet fully felt. One of the more stranger brews for me, pretty darn close to Le Terroir which also had the same intriguing power. Smells like a fine sour yet tastes in the form of sparkling wine with IPA features. This four pack will knock you on your ass. Would I buy more?-why yes I would! Definitely worth a go!"
"Victory's DirtWolf double IPA was respectable, but this beer truly brakes new ground in the world of double IPAs. The combination of Mosaic and Azacca hops gave this beer a color, an aroma and a flavor profile that was like no other I have come across. Kudos to the folks at Victory for not merely resting on their laurels. I really look forward to their future experimental releases, as well as to the Azacca hop variety being utilized by Victory and other breweries as well."
""
""
"I was very surprised when I saw that this was a 9% abv. I could not detect any alcohol or boozy taste. Instead, crisp, clean , dry and waiting for the next one."
""
""
"Overall - Sorry fellas but this one left me a bit dissapointed. I loved hop wallop and I'm sad I never reviewed one, but that beer turned me on to victory. Having hop ranch and it being such a hyped up beer I thought I would have gotten more flavor!!! Make your own choices, but I don't know that I will seek this out again."

""
""

"O: I really enjoy this beer, not a touch of alcohol on the tongue and enjoyed the sweetness of it but not overwhelming. Really wish this was a year-round offering."

""
""
"Overall a tasty and very quaffable DIPA."
"God Bless America."
"O: Easy to drink and smells lovely. Quite the sipper, not something I’m drinking quickly – Seems great for apps at a cocktail/family party. Another delicious offering from Victory, although I want to take a spin to D-Town and sample some that’s freshly squeezed at the brewery. A go to brew for a quiet/low-key affair."

"O: Dangerously easy to drink, especially with the lighter mouthfeel. Extremely well balanced and too easy to put down. Definitely another winner from Victory"

"Never looked to Victory for IPA's but between this and Dirtwolf I am."
"12oz bottle, think I paid $2.99. Color was yellow, clear, sticky lacing. Aroma was ammonia and cat pee, super hoppy bits of pine and earth, still not my favorite hop profile but not bad and certainly extra hoppy. Flavor was mostly hops, earthy, but if pine, lots of hops. This actually his the alcohol quite well for 9%."

"O- An equisite culmination to a bunch of research. This Imperial IPA delivers a well-needed and absolutely unique flavor to the world of Imperial IPA's. You cannot equate this with any other DIPA on the market and it deserves top honors. Since it reminds me so much of a Brett-infused beer (see above), it is amazing to see how hops can mimmick that flavor profile. Furthermore, the price (~$10.50 4-Pack) is an absolute bargain which makes it all-the-more attractive. I know Victory is not available to everyone, but those who get Victory beers and love a great DIPA with caracteristics which you have yet to experience, do yourself a favor and grab yourself a 4-Pack"

"Overall, this is the best IPA-class (double or single) beer I've had from Victory, and I don't think it's really close. Amazing balance and uniqueness and certainly (imho) belongs in the top 250 over DirtWolf. Heck, it might be one of my favorite IPAs now. It's a shame it's not easier for me to get my hands on this one, because I have a feeling I'd be buying it with some frequency."

""

"O- Not the everyday IIPA. It looks different (not 'amber'), smells different (not a hop bomb), and the 9.0 abv is drinkable w/o the booziness or sugary sweets."

"First DirtWolf and then this. Those folks at Victory are killing it right now! While I think I like the sheer, kick-you-in-the-balls-of-your-tongue citrusy glory of DirtWolf, this one is awfully good too. Cheers to Victory!"

"UPDATE 1/20/14: Having that one now, in a Harpoon IPA glass, and immediately got some white grape juice flavor. Nice. Easy drinking and very smooth. Still getting a hint of vinegar but that is not uncommon for DIPAs in my experience. And still not exceptional enough to raise my ratings. But it is damn good, seems like I just opened the bottle and it's almost all gone already!"

"o - great beer, not sure if I like better then Dirt Wolf but will have to save that comparison for when I get my hand on their next batch."

"O. Wonderful beer, well balanced, not over the top hop. Great on a hot day"
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is really nice. Light hue, large foamy head, lots of effervescence, thick lacing. Nose is bready and piney, with plenty of citrus and bit of sweet buttery tone. Hops, yeast, and strong citrus notes. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The first bottle I had of this I wasn't sure of. By the second, third, and fourth bottle, I was very sure. The cattiness and lemon is hard to appreciate at first, but the more you drink, the more the other flavors (grapefruit and pineapple) show their stuff. The beer is very dry, with almost no malt- therefore leaving it unbalanced. If you like hop juice style IPAs, this one's for you. For fans of more balanced IPAs with interesting malt bills, I wouldn't suggest it.I personally like both, so this works for me!"
"O: Love this beer!"
""
"The mosaic hops are a treat and this has a nice bite to it. Hop Ranch may be too acidic for some, but it is certainly worth checking out, this is a great IIPA and a sign of good things to come from Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty, easy drinking beer. The aroma is a bit off but the flavor makes up for it."
""
"O: I would drink a 4-pack of this every day if the circumstances allowed for that. Such a well-executed beer by Victory. With this and DirtWolf, they're back on my radar!"
""
""
"Overall impression: If I was to be served a DIPA in Munchen, this would be it. Tastes like a sweet, salty pretzel which passes my great beer taste. Much better than Dirt Wolf. If you were to mix this and Limbo 50/50 you would have Heady Topper. Thank you Victory."

"With this and Dirt Wolf on the market, Victory's decision to retire Hop Wallop seems like a no-brainer. It just would not compete with two far superior (in my opinion) double IPAs cannibalizing sales. The brewing world really needs to give Victory it's due now. This is a brewery that has totally reinvented its approach to its IPAs after its existing IPA skus stopped being truly relevant in the market years ago. Hop Devil and Hop Wallop are fine beers, but they just don't get the beer geeks going like they used to. Now Victory has released two top-notch, hype-worthy double IPAs in the past few months. Hop Ranch and Dirt Wolf are on par with the best double IPAs in the country. In my opinion they can stack up with the likes of Pliny or Heady Topper. And the beauty of it is that they should have a much broader reach in the national market. Very impressive."
""
"O - Excellent Imperial IPA that proves more isnt always better, this is by far an extreme IPA, sure it has a high alcohol content, (THAT YOU CANNOT DETECT AT ALL!!!!) but its not overwhelming with bitterness or sweet boozey malt, it has a great flavor, good aroma, and goes down ohh so easy. Get yourself some."
"Overall: Good, even great beer, and a real treat for those who want to taste every possible hop flavor (so, true to its name and conceit). Not my favorite, but I'll enjoy the rest of this 4pack."
""
""
"Overall its a solid addition to the Victory line up at a good price point. Mosaic hops are one of my favorites and they shine in this beers aroma. A must try for any hophead."
""
""
""
"Overall even though the aroma could be a bit more pungent this is one great DIPA. Very balanced with sweeter, fruitier hop notes and a well hidden ABV. My only complaint is being a PA resident and not finding any of this or Dirt wolf. Shame."
"overall: Surprise, surprise, this beer is not as good as dirtwolf...but its still a GREAT ipa, and its different enough from dirtwolf to merit it a try (or 4!). Its one that comes off more on the fruity and sweet side, and I appreciate that! Its fruit flavors are amazing, and its smell (tho subtle) adds a lot to each drink. A great buy (even if you already have dirtwolf), and a great new hoppy brew from victory. Lets hope that their next hoppy brew is just as good! 4.5\5"

""
"As good as Victory's DirtWolf is, this is even a notch above that. Only two hops used: Mosaic and the relatively new Azacca. Destined to be one of the best widely-available DIPAs in the east US."
""
"O: This beer seemed to initially have strange aromas and flavors compared to other IPAs—cat urine immediate came to mind—but the smell and taste seem to grow upon you and become interesting, especially as the beer warms up a bit. I think this might have had something to do with this beer having a completely different hop profile that I wasn't accustomed to. Overall, it is very drinkable considering its strength because the alcohol is very well hidden from the taste."
""
""
"O: I had high expectations after trying dirt wolf, but I think this one is even better. This is a hop head's delight. Pretty much one dimensional with the hops stealing the show, but wow it's a great showing. Hopefully I can find more, because I'd love to house a case of this stuff."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 5/24/14. Pours a light yellow, with a half inch of white head that leaves behind traces of lace. Smell is loads of of citrus, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, pine tree, and grapefruit. Taste is very tropical, with a nice grapefruit finish that doesn't over do it. Body is thin for its abv, nice amount of life, a touch dry, and so drinkable it is scary. This is top notch from Victory."

"O- The jury is out on this one. I can't decide how I feel about it. I definitely can't say I don't like it. It is just very unlike the majority of IPAs I have had... And I've had a lot.

"Overall (4.25): This is another really, really good DIPA from Victory. Hop Wallop (R.I.P.), Dirt Wolf, and now this all have something in common: each one is (was) a technically very well-crafted brew with excellent flavors, aroma, appearance, and feel, but all feel like they err on the side of caution (if you call scores above 4.0 erring in any way). They do everything very, very well, but nothing quite comes off as brilliant. That said, I can’t overstate the fact that Victory did everything—every single aspect of this beer—very, very well. And $10-11/sixer for a DIPA of this quality? Yes please."

"One of the cleanest DIPAs I’ve had in recently memory. It’s deceptive so remember to sip, not chug. I should have taken my own advice. Heh."

"12oz bottle with a Best By date of May 24 2014 on the neck. Pours a translucent light golden color with a 1/4 inch of head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is light citrus peel and pineapple. Some floral hops notes as well. The taste is more of that tropical fruit flavor. Pineapple, sweet orange and grapefruit, peach and some floral hops. More flowery towards the end. Fair amount of an alcohol presence, but drinks easily. Light mouthfeel that is somewhat dry. Overall, solid Imperial IPA. Not as good as Dirt Wolf but a welcome addition for sure."

Taste is citrusy with a slight pine finish coupled with subtle malt on the back of the palate. Creamy and full bodied, this brew glides over the tongue. I think I'll have another! Kudos to Victory, who's new brews continue to impress!"

"Overall - I prefer Dirt Wolf and even Hop Wallop to this, but I'll enjoy a few more of these!"

"Pours out an attractive golden color with a moderate white head. Aroma is of dank, sticky pine resin, lots of citrus zest, light malty bready notes, light malt, more bitter hop punch. Taste is complex, a nice punch of hops citrus zest, sticky, almost sappy pine, lots of resin, enamel ruining bitterness, and that is not a bad thing. Light lingering alcohol, some more citrus rind bitterness."
""

"A stellar brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"A few thoughts on Hop Ranch. Pours lighter than expected, more the color of a Pale Ale or dare I say a Pilsner? Moderate lacing coats my Ithaca pint glass. Wafting from the bottle is a touch of fruit cocktail. Nice popping carbo delivers white grape/lemony zest hop flavors followed by a very faint pale malt, ending with a slight tart dryness. No lingering bitterness at all. Just slightly tart and dry which induces my next swig. Drinkability is off the charts. Previous to having this I knocked down a Rogue Yellow Snow IPA ironically being more the heavy sipper. Hop Ranch is light and thirst quenching for a DIPA. Very dangerous, I recommend especially if your a hop fan. So glad I don't have to search far from home for quality IPAs/DIPAs thanks Victory for Hop Ranch/Dirt Wolf and Troegs for IPA and Nugget Nectar..."

First Dirt Wolf and now Hop Ranch, no doubt in my mind they are going to be killing it for years to come at this rate. If you can get your hands on this one, you buy it."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very clean, smooth drinking DIPA. Almost thin and sessionable as crazy as that sounds for a 9%er. Probably has to do with the huge tropical fruit forward profile. Aside from the negative smell, it's a well rounded, balanced DIPA."
"O - Overall, I am pretty disappointed. I didn't get any fruity notes from the hops at all. There was very low malt and lower bitterness, both positives but I didn't particularly care for the hops used."
"Very lightly hazy gold colored beer and nice white half inch head. Lace is stringy and shifting. After the head fades there remains a broken, thin white layer over the beer and a ring around the edge. Aroma is very clean with an uplifting mix of tropical and citrus fruit. Sweet red grapefruit, candy lime, mango, passionfruit, a little bit of zesty spicy hop, a touch of pine, and a soft caramel-dough malt profile. Flavor is equally loaded with tropical fruity varieties and citrus with more pronounced pine, tea, and earthiness. Dry, powdery, acidic, mouthwatering bitterness throughout the finish. I wonder if there's honey in this... The alcohol or high ABV is completely hidden to me. This is a pretty excellent, friendly double IPA. Very amiable."
"Overall - This is a very tropical, juicy, west coast style hop bomb of an ipa. Its a double ipa so I'm pretty sure this beer is around 9% but it is so smooth you would think your drinking a six percent ipa. I gave this beer a 4 (which is rare to even come above 3.75 for me I'm pretty harsh with ratings and reviews ) But the fact of how easy this drinks for a DIPA....I couldn't help but hit 4. So drinkable, juicy and unbelievable. This beer deserves every good rating it gets. Great job victory, holy SHIT."
"o - yet another impressive offering in the IPA realm for victory. and dat pricepoint doe...pick it up, check it out...it will be your new fridge beer - and they date the bottles!!!"
""
"O - A very unique take on a big IPA. Instead of going for a big tropical hop explosion like so many DIPAs, or upping the malts and balancing things out like the East Coast is known for, Victory has created a bold yet delicate brew with elements of US, English and even Belgian beers. But despite it's complexity, it drinks super easy and would be welcome at a meal or hanging with friends. Probably an excellent companion to Dirtwolfas well, as each showcase American hops without sacrificing balance and drinkability, and bring a very different profile to the table."
""
"O - Quite simply, this is among the best IPAs I have ever had. I am a sucker for big tropical and citrus hops and this has them in droves. You would be hard pressed to find a more drinkable 9% beer. If this were brewed year round, it would probably hold a monopoly on my fridge space."
""
"Served in a tulip glass, a pristine, clear, golden-yellow color, with a small, retaining, white head, that dotted the glass with lacing; tiny Champagne-like bubbles perpetually popped from the bottom. Nice aroma, full of lemony hops and ripe tropical fruits. After the aroma, the taste was a bit of a let-down. Lemon pith, neutral alcohol, and a lasting graininess, ushering in a wave of bitterness that, though appropriate for the style, seemed to wash away much of the fruity/citrusy goodness that I was expecting from the nose. Slightly metallic in the aftertaste, but within tolerance. Medium body, decently drinkable. Solid overall, but probably not something I'd revisit too often."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd like to do a side-by-side with DirtWolf sometime, but seeing as I got probably the last 4-pack in the Twin Tiers area, I'll have to wait til next year. Comparing this to my DirtWolf review, they seem to have similar flavor profiles, although each is unique. Regardless, I'm just happy to have two stellar fruit-forward DIPAs that I don't have to drive to Vermont to get. Outstanding!"

"Bright golden yellow color with a slight haze covered by a small, tightly bubbled head that shrinks to large groups of soapy bubbles at the edges. Peppery, pungent hop aroma featuring pink grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerine coated in an aromatic herbal marijuana-like dankness. The dank, resinous, sticky-icky-ness continues into the flavor before transitioning immediately to a more sweet, festive fruit profile. Citrus, mango, grape, melon, and pear all contribute a solid sweetness to counter the initial blast of peppery, herbal weed. Lingering oily, resinous, almost acidic notes left behind. Drinks maybe more like 8%, but you can tell you're drinking a serious beer, even if the alcohol never really shows itself. Medium-plus, creamy body with a fairly hefty bitterness. A big, pungently hoppy DIPA. Victory keeps on kicking ass."

"Overall impression: One of the most unique Double IPA's I've ever had. I loved it. Seems very dry and thin for a double IPA but the unique aroma and flavor are lovely. Glad to try it."
""
""
"Anyway, it pours very light yellow in color. Smells great. Citrusy and fruity in general. Bursting with the same when tasted. Others have said there's an earthy taste to. I'd have to agree. I've been a little negative after all the Dirtwolf hype, but I have to say that both of these are really tasty new DIPAs with comparatively low prices. Thank you, Victory!"
"I will need to try this again and from a different glass - maybe my mug is giving me a false reading on aromas."

"Overall – A very easy drinking and very fruity and flavorful IPA. After introducing their Dirtwolf (which is fantastic), Victory is really nailing the strong IPA’s and hit it again with Hop Ranch as it is truly an enjoyable brew to drink."

"This beer is drinkable any time of year. It has the light fruity notes of summer balanced by hops and bitterness that would satisfy you any time of year. It's a wonderful all around beer with great complexity and approachability. The finish is just long enough to leave a pleasant taste and make you want another sip."
""

"Overall: With Dirt Wolf and this beer, Victory has really lifted its IPA game"
""
""

"Huge hoppiness with a moderately low bitterness. Peach, tropical fruits and dank florals. Easily the best beer I've had from Victory."

"O - I really like this one Victory is brewing up some great new beers"
""
""
"Taste: Tastes just like it smells. It's a very easy and smooth drinking beer. Surprised at the alcohol content to be honest. It might become a go-to for a summer day beer choice."

"O- No joke, one of my new top 5 IPAs. This has the smoothness and flavor of some of the best single IPAs with the strength of a DIPA. I'm kicking myself for only getting a single of this. Forget DirtWolf, this is the one you need to get your hands on."

"This is an excellent IIPA. The alcohol is not evident at all, and this will tickle your hop fancy for sure. Would certainly buy again."

"Poured into an Odell tulip. Hazy yellow with some floaties and a small one finger (or less)head. Smell of massive citrus and topical fruits, with a hint of breadiness. The mouthfeel is medium; closer to an IPA, but the taste is just incredible, with tart lemon and grapefruit and tropical fruits up front, followed by a malty, bready backbone that is tempered by hop bitterness. It doesn't have the perfect balance of Dirtwolf, but the taste is just incredible."
"Poured from bottle into a chilled pint glass. Nice thick white head which did not dissipate much at all. Good even lacing all the way. The nose was outstanding, with strong piney, lemon/pineapple/grapefruit scents and an obviously strong hop presence. On the palate, the taste was not quite as compelling as the nose, with an almost grassy dank on the tip, although the finish was very smooth and citrusy pleasant. Mouthfeel was average, nothing extraordinary. Overall, a very good example of the style. I like this much better than DirtWolf, even if it did not live up to all the hype and expectations I had based upon same. Will gladly hoard this while I can, but there are other IPAs and DIPAs I would reach for over this. Not a lot of them, but enough. In any event, another strong effort by Victory, which seems to be kickin' A these days. Kudos!"
""
"O: I was expecting something a little bit more here - I'd say I enjoyed DirtWolf more - this is lighter and brighter and more citric with less malt presence. A good beer, but I'm undercutting the average here. Take it for what you will. Maybe I just need a couple more to change my mind. For now, this is this."
""
"This tastes way better than average for the beer style since it just has so much hop flavor without a bunch of sweet malt to cover. The taste of hops is drenched in the beer with slight pepper and mild lime zest but mainly I get a more orange rind sweet and tangy taste which indicates some Mosaic however I have not heard of the other hop so I will just say sweetened grapefruit in its raw form with very low astringency or any acidic bite. I love how easy this is to enjoy until you consumed three and want to try to transcribe the review, haha. I do think this is a nice compliment to the Dirt Wolf that was just released as it is a stronger IPA, but seems a little less bitter to my tastebuds"
"Overall: I originally commented that DirtWolf was the best beer Victory created in years. It only took them two months to top it. I will enjoy my case immensely and will definitely buy it again next year."

"Felt a need to re-review this one. About halfway thru my second case and none of the bottles stood up to the first one had. Could it have fallen off that quickly? Anyway, still a good brew but not blowing me away like the first one did."

"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Hazy gold with lots of floaters, sticky, plus sized head. Ton of tropics fruit on the nose. Taste mimics aroma, lots of pineapple, not overly bitter. Surprising drinkable, well carbonated, resinous mouthfeel. Loved it! Best dipa I have had in a while."
"Pours a crisp, clear light golden color with a thick, creamy white head that settles to a thin film with clumpy streaks of lacing. Juicy, sweaty nose of pineapple, mango, and general tropical goodness with a light grassy earthiness. Very easy drinking with a light, crisp body that drinks like it's 7% and not the listed 9%. Flavor starts initially with an overload of tropical juice and fruit before transitioning to a piney and slightly grassy finish. No distinct malt presence anywhere in the body and not overly bitter in the finish. Drinks like a bright West Coast IPA or a lesser Double Sunshine. For what this is, (a hopefully) year round-ish """shelf""" IPA that will see distro in multiple states, I can't think of anything better. Not in the class of the best VT or CA IPAs but damn good enough."

"O-very nice DIPA from Victory, great range of flavors, liked Dirt Wolf slightly more"
""
""

"This is another great DIPA from Victory. It stands out compared to Victory's original take on hoppy beers. It's almost on the same level as DirtWolf, but it just comes down to preference. There's a west-coast vibe to this one. Well crafted and recommended."

"Medium body with a blast of dank, sticky hops providing the perfect amount of dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt backbone into a dry finish. The hop profile is very complex with resinous oils, earthy, grassy pine, tropical/citrus fruit sweetness and scallion/onion-y, summit-like flavors. Really well balanced with a stronger tropical/citrus fruit character than the nose hinted at and delicate pale malts countering the earthy bitterness. Hints of grapefruit, mango, pineapple and lemon peel followed by subtle biscuit and graham cracker flavor. The ABV is excellently masked with no heat to speak of. Dangerously drinkable which is surprising considering this beer's complexity. One of the better IPAs I've had in some time. This beer destroys DirtWolf in my opinion and is up there with some of the best batches of Stone Enjoy By. I haven't been a big fan of most of Victory's IPAs but I highly recommend seeking this beer out."
