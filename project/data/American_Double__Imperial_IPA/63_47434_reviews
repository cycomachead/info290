"Beautiful golden color with a little less than an inch of foam.  Tastes and smells citrusy and mildly hoppy.  Goes down easy.  A solid IPA from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
"O: This IPA is better than Heady Topper."
""
"Paid a lot to be disappointed.  Finishing it now just for the sheer abv and not waste the cash I spent on it."
"O: A DIPA featuring a balance between hop citrus, fruit and floral flavors and yeast driven fruit flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could have been a lot better with more flavor to balance out the high abv. still pretty good"
""
""
""
""
"As far as DIPAs go, this one is certainly not """in your face""" as far as hop intensity is concerned. Great focus on the middle tones of the hops, rather than the often overly-bitter takes on this style. My biggest beef with this brew would be the ABV... 9.3% and I definitely tasted it. Regardless, I am looking forward to next year's version!"

"Compelling DIPA. Not a blunderbuss of pine resins and other dank elements ... Artfully fruity and overall on the sweet side."
"Probably would not seek out and purchase again unless some changes are made."
"Pours a dull gold with very persistent head. Aroma is strong, balanced and inviting. Malt aroma is of sweet grains and hops are strongest with notes of spice, citrus and slight resin. Tastes strongly of floral and spicey hops with faint notes of citrus, also faint sweet toast from the malt. Well balanced. Feels slick in the mouth,  lighter bodied with close to lively,  spritzy, carbonation. Finishes long and strong with a good balance between sweet and bitter, however leaning towards bitter. Good beer, very fresh."

"Really nice."

"22oz bottle claims 9.5% ABV and best by 04/07/15.  Served in a tulip glass.  Golden orange color, lightly hazed, with an ample white head.  Yeasty aroma.  Orange peel, citrus.  Really big citrus hop flavor, with an almost grapefruit-like astringency.  This bottle conditioned XPA really is all about the hops.  There's very little malt backbone, and I think I detect a bit of wheat, perhaps used to deliberately subdue malt flavor.  Carbonation is on the high side in this bottle.  As previously reported, all-day IPA enthusiasts will probably love this, but otherwise it's just ok."

"Good beer. But the price point  is a tad high at 6 a bomber.  Overall taste has a touch more alcohol  burn then I like out of a beer. 9.5 % I expect  some  but a little  less  booze  would  be nicer.  Good notes  of tropical  fruit  and citrus  but the burning  booze  killed  it."
""
""
""
""
"Be careful with this one. It's uber-tasty, so you want to keep sipping on it, but it has the best hidden 9.5% ABV (according to the bottle) I have ever had."

"Quintessential Double IPA. Appearance is a decent size, slow to settle, thick, off-white head, lace, and a clear honey amber color. Aroma is hops, caramel malt, spice, grain. Flavor's like aroma, has a slight sweetness, good tartness, and the proper bitterness for this kind of beer. Has a nice mouth filling feeling yet with just the right buzz from good carbonation for excellent body. Also delivers some alcohol warmth. A hop monster for sure, but a good monster."
""
""
"It feels weird to me to rate an experimental beer that changes, as far as I know, every year. But this is one very drinkable DIPA. Almost creamy without being cloying. Perfect amount of bitterness. Not too fruity or citrusy. Really damn good IPA. Sure it could be prettier but who cares. Glad I snuck this into the grocery cart today."

"Top 5 all time favorite IPAs"
"O: Overall, this is an absolutely stellar beer. I consumed a whole bomber on my own, despite its heaviness. Deschutes continues to kill it!"
"Hoppy and sweet yet balanced. One of the best IPAs I've tasted. Excellent."
""
"On tap in a tulip glass. Appearance: poured a 1""" white head that dropped quickly with some nice lacing on the glass. Color is a cloudy golden-orange with moderate streaming carbonation. Aroma: hop forward with pine, citrus dominate and some white bread dough in the background. Mouthfeel: medium bodied and viscous, with a dry, bitter, warming finish. Flavor: strong grapefruit, tangerine, and pine hops are balanced with nice biscuit and malty sweetness. Overall: a nice sipper at 9.5% abv. It is not overly boozy (which is plus), but the alcohol is not entirely hidden either."

"Reviewed this Jan 12 2015 so bottle was very fresh. Nice grapefruit, orange and pineapple aroma, some pine as well. Not too strong or danky more of a well balanced easy drinking double IPA. Would rank higher but doesn't give you that """POW!""" like the guy fom stepbrothers says"

"Pours hazy golden color with 2 finger width foamy head. Head retention is decent. There is a good amount of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma really isn't that strong. Most of what I can make out is apple. On tasting, there is a slight malty taste, quickly followed by a hoppy explosion. I can taste a hint of apple at the end. Kind of a bitter, soapy aftertaste. The taste is good, but there is something a little off, and it may be the soapiness at the end. I will say that I drank this a little over a month after the date on the bottle, so my review may have been different if I drank it earlier."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 7/15/2014. Pours light hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, mango, peach, papaya, apricot, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, papaya, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, apricot, mango, light caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Final Word: Definitely a beer for hop lovers only, though the character of the hops used is unique enough to warrant at least a taste by any beer drinker, as it’s far from offensive. Though not as well balanced as it should be, it’s a far cry from your kick-in-the-teeth bitter IPAs out there. Try it if you love hops and are looking for something new, but don’t bother if you are still getting used to/learning to appreciate hops."

"Poured a golden, orangish body with rather large amount of head and lace. Aroma is textbook citric hops with touches of spice and caramel/sweet malt. Smooth, a rather flavorful hoppy beer as the hops are not one note. I get not only a strong citric vibe but also some tropical and grapefruit which, along with touches of caramel, give off a little sweetness. Beer is well balanced and also has a bread/cracker like edge just to make sure it isn't too hoppy and aids a rather dry finish."

"Hard to review this one thinking in the IIPA style - but I like the brew."

"Overall: With Deschutes on my """breweries to try""" list, I randomly ran across this bomber next to the regulars in my local gorcery store. I picked it up without hesitation and glad I did. I don't get the prominent malt bill that others mention. It was almost all hops with a sweet malt undertone which I prefer in an IPA/IIPA. This must be due to this bottle still having a few months before the expiration date. It reminds me a lot of Two Hearted actually. At first, the taste didn't quite match the smell with it's subtleties, but as it warmed, it became bolder. Also one of the smoothest IIPA's I've had in recent memory. Lastly, at $6.99 a bomber, it's reasonably priced. Really an excellent beer across the board and looking forward to trying their other stuff."

"The feel is nearly perfect for an IPA of any kind. Alcohol, which for its strength was virtually undetectable in the aroma and flavor, takes nothing away from the feel and makes for dangerous drinkability. One honestly could drink more than a bomber thinking nothing of it before getting hit with it. It's frothy and unbelievably creamy on the palate. A little dryness kicks in to give the balance many don't consider when thinking about mouthfeel, and a bright sort of crispness stays with it while letting the creaminess rule."
""
""
""
"A great overall brew. Very atypical of the style but in a good way."
""
""
""
""
"Was very excited to try this beer, the excitement fell off somewhat quickly. This beer over all is a good beer, not a great beer IMO. I appreciate the huge burst of floral, fragrant, and piney hops that come through, then disappear quickly. This is followed by a pleasant, medium hoppy bitterness that carries through the palate. I believe this along with the higher maltiness of the beer makes this beer very drinkable. I pick up some minimal dankiness along with some nice resinous notes. There are some regularly occurring citrus/grapefruit notes. There are faint hints of pineapple/tropical I perceive in this brew as well. I love the low carbonation and creamier mouthfeel of each sip. However, I am not too big on the residual sweetness left over from fermentation. The caramel and minimal grainy flavors near the end of the palate are welcomed. If you like your DIPA's on the sweeter side, this is a brew you should have, if available."

"This was bottled in 2013 for the Deschutes 25th anniversary. The hoppiness is mostly gone, but this has cellared well and become very like a barleywine without the overwhelming sweetness. I would recommend it if you are not too demanding about hoppiness."

"Overall - I've snagged this every year since the '12 release, and I have to say this is the best version yet! So juicy with a bitter edge that's balanced by that sweet caramel backbone. I usually only buy one bottle then wait for the next year, but this might be something I'll pick up quite a few times over the next few months."
""
"on tap into a 10 oz snifter. aromas mostly candied fruit. taste has more of the fresh juicy fruit. not too much dankness. little carbonation. went down pretty well, might've enjoyed the beer's characteristics with just a hint less alcohol involvement, less maltiness"
""
""
""
""
"Big fruity hops - all the sweetest parts of citrus from Amarillo, Cascade and Citra. No burn, light enough, and wears its IBUs easily. But too sugary to quaff."

"Just did a side by side comparison with the enjoy by. Very close to identical. Bought a growler fill so was pretty fresh. Very clear in appearance. The aroma was not as pronounced considering this was a dipa but the taste is spot on. Glad I picked this one up."

""

"Poured with a 2 finger head into a pint glass that turned to an off white froth and gave light lacing. The color is a slightly translucent orange. The smell is strong with citrus, notably orange, as well as hops. The taste has citrus and a strong hop flavor, and the hops taste slightly different from normal which explains why the bottle says experimental hops, and has a strong aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy with strong carbonation. Overall it is very good and I would recommend."
"O: A super, well balanced imperial iPa that just makes me think of summer sun and fresh delicious hops in a sweet nectar. This beer demands another try. On a warm day in particular. Hop heads will be pleased with this one!"

"Overall - This is good stuff. It really tastes like a west coast meets east coast ipa with its multiple hop flavors. Its actually balanced well since the bitter and sweet work together and nothing gets too overbearing. Drinks easy also. Its a little warm but not too much. Excellent beer, and very affordable, I paid 6.99$ at a more pricey bottle shop even, so I will be drinking this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall - much more aggressive hop character than I expected; enjoyed this offering from Deschutes!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Amazing aroma, good taste, but the mouthfeel is terrible."
""
""
"This is my first experience with Deschutes and I am quite excited. Had to travel out of state to pick up a few of their bottles. The appearance is a handsome golden amber color with a thick white head that gives way to a very substantial film and lacing. The nose is surprisingly subtle for this style of ale. There are alot of piney and floral hops with a substantial malt background. You can definitely tell the beer is super fresh but not of the traditional west coast California variety. The flavor follows suit beautifully. Not too bitter, not too malty; just super balanced. This reminds me more of some of the awesome ipas produced by dogfish head than the typical west coast ipas. If this is any sign of the quality of the other offerings from this brewery, I cant wait."

"Poured out of a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Dated 3/14/14, purchased from Binny's Beverage Depot for $5.99, great deal. Poured a moderately cloudy orange/copper color, head dissipated to leave a nice lacing. A nice mango, citrus and malt aroma. Nice hoppy taste, bitter to start but a great finish. Very good DIPA, high abv not really noticeable, will have to get me more of these. Prost!"
"Very floral and perfumey, hop dominant, with nice accents of citrus. Refreshing change of pace from the usual west coast varieties. The bitterness is a little much for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good DIPA, would be interested to know what the other hops used in this are, it tastes good and it smells amazing, glad I grabbed one to try!"
"This is a solid DIPA. It's not something that knocked my socks off, but it's well crafted and fun to drink."
"Poured out of a 22oz. bottle the beer had a clear copper color with a nice amount of off-white foam that left a nice layer of lace in its wake. The smell is very malt forward with a pungent alcohol presence, however there are some nice bready aromas and slight citrus characters mixed in at the back of the nose. The taste is interesting, not what I expected at all, bitter and fruity up front (fruity not necessarily citrus) with a nice sweet malt flavor and finish with a bitter/acidic aftertaste. For me what is missing is the hops smell and/or taste from what I would expect from this style, not necessarily a bad beer just not what I expect from the style. So overall this is a decent beer and is something worth trying, just did not seem to agree with my pallet as it was a bit bitter, lacked a real hop component, and left me with a bit of a acidic aftertaste (maybe due to the high ABV)"

"We toured the Deschutes Brewery in June of 2013. I was really impressed with the dedication to good beer and all the employes we met. It certainly is a medium sized brewery, with a craft beer heritage. I have always liked their Inversion IPA and most of their selections. Brewforia, one of the many great beer pubs in Boise, has the Henge on tap. I happened into Whole Foods to try a bottle of this """Experimental IPA""" before I fill a growler with this brew. Poured tall into a 12 oz glass, stunning head , creamy white and tall as the mountains in the near distance. Lacing lingers and stalls and falls slowly down the glass sides. Taste is smooth, very smoth, caresses the palette, citrus hints of grapefruit, not as much as other reviewers describe, orange, hints of lemons, finishes clean...At 9.3 ACL no whispers of the high alcohol, but after a 22 ouncer got a sweet buzz going on. Not as complex as some IPA's but still a great IPA! Keep the experiment going. Cheers."
""
""
""
"O - While still a good DIPA, I was a little let down by this one considering how much I've enjoyed the other beers in their lineup. Just not quite enough depth of hop character to hang with the best in the category."
""
"Overall: This is a damn fine DIPA. Absolutely fantastic! Any fan of sweet orange citrus DIPAs will love this."
"D - I enjoyed this brew. It has many of the characteristics I like in a DIPA but it isn't quite as fully-actualized as say a Bell's Hopslam or a Pliny the Elder."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer improves significantly as it warms. A great IPA. Seems quite a bit different than last years to me. Wonder if they used different experimental hops in this years batch? The minty flavors must be coming from some new variety of hops. This one is unique because of this. Think I preferred last years batch but maybe it is just different because my palate has shifted in the past year."
""
""
"Way better than a fine Port Wine. Oregon should be proud. Have not seen a Washington brewery go this bold."
""
""
""
"Hop Henge is the real deal. The hops are bold; the hops are tropical; the hops are decadent. They make me feel like a young-alpha-acid-palate-free-IPA-newbie experiencing Two-Hearted for the first time. Thanks for making a DIPA feel like new again Deschutes!"

"Hop Henge IPA poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Medium thick head that fades quickly but adheres well to the glass. Appearance is your classic IPA copper with surprisingly high transparency. A pleasant citrus hop IPA aroma wafts to the nose and upon first sip an overpowering bitterness hits the palate. Bitterness through and through that starts and finishes hard. Mouthfeel is soft and light. To me it seems the beer has the bitterness of a double IPA without much of the additional complexities or depth of flavor. On the other hand, the 9.3% alcohol is masked incredibly well. This is a strong and bitter IPA without much flavor and a thin mouth feel. Not bad, not great, this is another Deschutes beer that you can tell is high quality but makes you think the brewers played it safe. Someone will have to explain to me why this is an experimental IPA."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium to light body with moderate carbonation and tons of hop oils and sticky resin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer, definitely worth trying. I think the aroma is this beer's greatest strength."
""
"O- This is my 300th rating/review, and I couldn't have picked a better one to use! HUGE aromas and flavors! If I were forced to describe what I want an IPA to taste like, this is probably what would come out. I am impressed (and bummed I have to order from Cali to get). Awesome IPA!"
""
""
""
"I Like this IPA, and it was a nice one by a top brewery."
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Buy. Order it online or trade if you can't find it locally. Drink fresh, obviously. If you don't like IPAs I don't know why you'd be bothering with this, but it is pretty extreme in terms of alcohol to body."
""
"A very balanced beer for 10.6 ABV, that I could drink several of. Will buy and drink again. Very soon."
"Overall - Full and balanced flavor with good hop profile. A dangrously drinkable heavy beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a damn good brew. ABV is very well hidden, this one will definitely creep up on you if you aren't careful. The unique aroma and flavor qualities as well as the $5 price point makes this worth grabbing a few of."
""
"bright effervescent golden. thick foamy white head which leaves thicker foam on the sides as it trails down. lots of hop bitterness in the smell and the taste. wondering what the 'experomental' hops are but this one already has a major share of them in it. a little bready, a little chewy, a little oily and slick. i'm not partial to the hops but after the Chasin' Freshies I wanted to try another on from Deschutes. overall, this is decent and, like the other guy said, for the price it is a great brew with a nice abv. a little more bitter and dry than I prefer, also, but still very good."

"Bought this out of respect for Fresh Squeezed. Drinks like an imperial, and the 9.3% alcohol hints that it should be. Great hop notes - floral, piney and citrus. Not overly bitter and surprisingly drinkable. Great beer for the price too, not a $15 bomber like others have tried to make their beers be that are nowhere near worth it."
"Yeah, my children, I am feeling this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all this is a nice double IPA that i personally think kicks loads of ass and has a hop bill that makes it a must try. Get it as fresh as you can, the better it is. Recommended to any fan of hops or big beers in general"

"From my tasting notes: It poured an orange gold with a decent head and loads of citrusy hops in the aroma. The taste began with a grapefruit hop profile with sweet vanilla malt tones and a slightly piney finish that lingered on the palate. There malty spine kept the Hop Henge from becoming completely overwhelming and gave it the perfect balance to make this a fantastic IIPA. There was a medium to full body on that made the brew satisfying and well rounded."

"O: Honestly, not my cup of tea. Overall this was overly bitter and acidic, not very palatable and certainly not sessionable. I'm generally a fan of IPAs and Deschutes brews, but I'm a bit disappointed with this one. Then again, at 10.9% ABV you won't care by the time you finish the bottle."

"O: This is a heavy weight like the masonry at Stonehenge. It tastes smells and feels like Deschutes used 50 lbs of ingredients for each bottle. The hops and bitterness were very subdued. Can we rename it Malt-Henge? If waiting 37 days past the best by date created what I had, I would recommend it, and if you plan on sharing this with a friend, buy two bottles."

"The Hop Henge is a good IPA and is a big beer! It poured a hazy copperis orange with thick head that is lacing nicely. The scent has a great pine and citrus base with sweet malt. The taste from start to finish is very well balanced the sweet malt and bitter citrus/pine flavors carry through and the after taste turns slightly bitter....all covering the 10% ABV. The mouthfeel is a full body with smooth carbonation. Overall...very good."

"O) This is just a really, really nice DIPA. I would call it slightly less floral/citrusy than California DIPAs, but great balance with good flavor. Drink this if you can find one."
""
"This rendition of Hop Henge is reminiscent of a supper-hopped version of a Belgian Pale Ale, perhaps owing to the character of the yeast, though this one is not bottle-conditioned. Tart, chewy yellow and orange fruits play with your taste buds as bitter evergreen American hop cones ruin them almost unnoticeably. For an American lover of Belgian beer and hops, this is heaven. This review is from memory and I've certainly neglected some flavor components, but sell you soul for a bottle of this experimental IPA batch if need be; it's worth it to experience for yourself."

"To paraphrase: """This is Hop Henge. I hope you relish it as much as I.""""
"There is only one other Imperial that I can personally compare to this beer and that would be the Firestone Walker Double Jack and it actually finishes in your mouth giving you that feeling of wanting more right away. So why wait."
""
""
"O: would definitely recommend this to anyone IPA lovers. It is a double IPA that is still very hoppy / citrus flavored. The malt doesn't take over."
"O- wow, fantastic double IPA. Not sure what hops are used, but never had this taste off them before. Like fresh squeezed oranges. Wheres the pulp?! No hint of the alcohol in the smell or the taste. Really incredible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- hoppy and ruthless, yet it has a nice malty sweetness to it. The flavors are pronounced on both ends of the flavor spectrum, making this one a slow sipper. 22oz May be too much for one sitting, but very good overall."
""
""
"Verdict: A fine DIPA from Deschutes. It does a good job of straddling the line of too sweet and just right and does at times cross into the territory of a boozy, sweet beer. This is definitely a beer worth seeking out for any hop head."

""
""

"Beer pours a nice amber color with about 3 fingers of off-white head. Nice head retention and sticky lacing. Rich scent of sugar and tangerine. Simple, clean and hoppy. Full-bodied and very sweet. A nice flavor. The sweetness is accompanied by a good dose of hops. Pretty nice balance, but I think a little too heavy on the sugary caramel flavor. Hits every part of the palate. Strong carbonation, full-bodied, and pretty thick. Very good imperial ipa. I love the hops (which don't overpower at the front or end), but would tone down the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very strange. I'm glad I tried it, but the malt bill with the choice of hops really through me off. My favorite part was the appearance and aroma. When it came to actually drinking the beer, I don't think I'll come back to this one. I really like everything I've had from Deschutte's, and this one just simply isn't for me."
""
""
"O- This big, hardy double IPA has nice a full hop bill and a nice alcohol heat that cuts some of the bitterness in the aftertaste. There is a nice sweetness for support aswell. This beer is a bit of a punch in the tongue, but that is a good thing. Just not a session beer."

"O - This is a great DIPA that I would glady buy again, especially given it's cheaper bomber price, 5.50, as compared to other DIPAs in bomber only format."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid and interesting """experimental""" IPA that borders on barleywine territory to me, but with less of the earthiness. Not surprising, given the 10.5% abv on this bad boy. Unfortunately I never had it before they changed the recipe, but this one is worth buying again, especially to enjoy with food. This bottle paired well with my spicy BBQ chicken wings."
"Hop Henge. The """Experimental""" IPA. I don't know what is so experimental about it...It doesn't really *taste*out of the ordinary. A medium hoppy DIPA, light on bittering hops. It's got a nice mellow hop profile, nothing like the usual super floralness of something like Pliny the Elder, or the super bitterness of anything made by Green Flash. High ABV at 10.6%...I should have written this review after a few sips instead of 20 oz. deep into the bomber. Nice color and lacing on this with a lingering head. Some citrus smelling hops and some yeast in the smell. Well rounded with the mouthfeel, doesn't go to one extreme or the other. Well balanced dry/sweet character. Really tasty if not basic/classic example of the style. If one were to come across a DIPA kit in a brewing shop, this is the beer that kit would produce. Not to say it isn't great. I like it. My favorite Deschutes brew thus far."
""
""
""
"O- This ale really grew on me as I enjoyed the first pour as it seemed to grow in the glass as the flavors opened with a rise in its temperature. I can't believe it has taken me this long to taste this ale and feel a bit foolish I haven't been selling this like crazy. At $4.99 for a bomber, I will most definitely be buying this again. Cheers!"

"Really enjoyed this beer. Smell on the beer is great, of hops and tropical fruit/ citrus. The alcohol on this is hard to notice and is hidden well, the beer is very drinkable. Taste is great and while hoppy the tropical notes really shine through, for me I got a lot of mango flavor. This is the first ipa that I've really picked up up the fruity/tropical flavors and I really enjoyed it. Great beer that I wish made its way out to NJ."
""
"Overall - A stellar DIPA by Deschutes. This brewery has yet to disappoint and this brew is a great treat for hopheads. Excellent balance of bitterness and malty sweetness."
""
""

""
"O: This beer never fails to impress me. This is the first time I've rated it, but I've had it in a number of blind tastings and it ends being my favorite because it's the complete package."

"O: Hell of a brew."
"Great DIPA from Deschutes, a nice showing of the """Northwest""" style, malt complexity with traditional west coast hop-barraging"

"O - This is a fantastic DIPA. Deschutes never disappoints. The alcohol is deceptively hidden, and the balance in this is great: not too bitter, not too sweet, not very boozy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a darn good IPA and I wish I lived closer to where this is available. Bad thing is is't only brewed between Jan. and April."
"This is good stuff. I really enjoy a malty sweet DIPA and this sure fits the bill. Don't get me wrong, there are still hops-a-plenty but it sure is thick and rich. I highly recommend it to fans of DIPAs on the malty side."
""
"O: Really enjoyable Sunday afternoon DIPA. On the DIPA spectrum, this one is a bit too sweet for me. However, I really did appreciate all the effort that went into making this delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid solid IPA esp for the price point. Had trouble finishing the bottle as it was pretty sweet."
"O - A solid """experimental""" DIPA, but not ready to play with the big boys of the style. It is a little too over-the-top, and needs to scale itself back a bit and find a balance. It brings some unique flavors to the table in what is a pretty over-produced style. Very good, but still flawed."
"o- unique because it has pure hop taste, but lacks the well rounded ipa flavor, it's like drinking unsweetened soymilk."
"Overall: A very good Imperial IPA from Deschutes. Great bitter citrus flavors with a nice balancing sweetness."
""
"O- If you described Hop Henge to me I wouldnt be too excited to try it. But this is well done and I enjoy drnking it"
""
""
""
"O - At 10.6%, it's a quality DIPA. A little expensive to toss in my repertoire, but I can see me drinking this more than once in my lifetime."
""
""
""
"O - Very Good. Every flavor combines superbly. Head lasts the entire time of sipping this beer. Very impressive. Only knock maybe that its a bit too mellow. IIPA i expect huge flavor that pops. This reminded me of something aged in which flavors started to blend together. Regardless, very very good."
""

"Pours a bright, opaque, orange, apricot color with a finger length white head that goes away slowly and leaves a blanket of thick lacing. Good amount of carbonation coming off the glass. Smells of wonderful, juicy tropical fruits like mango, papaya, guava, pineapple, orange, some pine, floral, grass, small amount of grain. Resinous, yet sweet smelling. Taste starts with lots of hop qualities as expected: resinous pine, orange, mango, papaya. Sweet even in the beginning. May of added some dextrose sugar. The the middle brings a modest malt backbone. More than I detected in the taste. A light biscuity note, as well as some sweet carmel and grain. The finish does an excellent job of showing off the hop qualities, yet still staying pretty balanced. Lots of tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, papaya, as well as resinous grass, pine, floral notes. Tastes a lot like different flavored gummi worms. Little hint of alcohol. Full body with a creamy and sticky mouthfeel. The sweetness throughout really helps to cut the bitterness and balance the beer. A really solid double ipa."

"M: Sweet, full bodied and huge. A lot of the sweetness is coming from the hops, but its a big sticky beer."

"I could drink another but for nearly 12$ for 650ml it's not cheap, I suppose I just should be happy that I have another great DIPA I can add to my rotation"

"Pours a dark amber. Thin cream head with little lacing. Smells hoppy enough but also faint fruit and alcohol. The alcohol taste is surprisingly mild for being 10.6 ABV. I am tasting a nice blend of hops with some faint fruit notes, perhaps apricot. The mouthfeel is a little too thin, needs more bubbles. Overall not a bad beer, definitely worth having but not my favorite IPA. I still prefer the other West Coast Hop Bombs like those offered by Stone Brewing."
""
""
""
"Had this from a Bomber poured into a pint glass. Good head, about a finger thick, and it clung to the glass pretty well. It had a beautiful orange hue. the taste wasn't too aggressively hoppy, but had good flavor, definitely still an IPA. overall, great beer, ill be bringing some of this back to GA with me."
""
""
""
"You think if the city is ever closed or destroyed for some reason, a local-ish headline might read """Bend, Oregon, over"""? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises pine needle, pine resin, grapefruit rind, mild toffee, and fresh grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything buttressed by a foundation of sweet caramel that blends very nicely with the various citrus fruits. (Wait, can a foundation buttress? Oh, well...) The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky-ish finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA, indeed, one that includes a lot of hop flavor without overwhelming the tongue with it and without losing a sense of balance. Good times."
""
"O/D-Really would like to go back to this one again some day. Definitely an 'experimental' IPA. I loved it then hated it then loved it again…then was confused and decided that I sorta liked it in the end. This one threw me for a loop."
""
"Overall: I appreciate the complexity of the beer, using a lot of experimental hops and achieving a very cool hop profile. I just can't help but feel that the abv is to high for the amount of hop character in this beer. The booze seems to cut the hoppy aftertaste short. Other than that, it is an awesome hoppy beer, I am digging the mosaic hops."
""
""
""
""
"10.6% alcohol (street cred)"
""
"Poured a light amber/orange colour with a 1-1.5 finger head that vanished quickly and left little to no tracing. Has a slightly fruity smell with traces of pine resin and caramel. The body is on the medium side, not too heavy but not too light. Taste is heavy on the hops with a medium to heavy bitterness on the aftertaste. A great beer for those hop heads like myself. Goes well with roasted garlic hummus. Recommend any ale enthusiasts try at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really glad I got to try this, thanks to my trading partner in Bend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good DIPA overall. Nice and citrusy with lots of tropical notes instead of being brutally bitter."
""
"Overall: I've been very impressed with Deschutes, but I do not think I would buy this brew again. The high abv had me curious and just dominated too much. But I will continue to advocate for Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A fantastic imperial IPA. Not much that I would change here - definitely a top 20 IPA for me, pushing for the top 10. I will drink it whenever available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap. Hog's Apothecary, Oakland, CA. Solid beer all around from Deschutes up in old Bend Oregon. Listed as an experimental imperial pale but seems rather tame from a hops profile. Pours very clear with a frothy head. I was expecting a punch in the hop face, none came. An above average pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Give this one a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great DIPA! Pungent tropical fruits, dominating and complex hop bitterness, sweet bready malts and the wheat/Belgian tripel notes make this a really interesting and enjoyable take of an Imperial IPA. This one is a stand out to me and I’m definitely going out to get another bottle!"
""
"O: A really spectacular DIPA with no hype whatsoever. Pick it up at your Safeway and marvel!"
""
""
"O – Good beer again this year. I like the malt complexities in this beer, but the hop complexities take some time to show through. When the beer warms up a bit the hop profile really makes a statement."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark gold with a finger and a half of foam. A few chunks of yeast floating around, whatever, not too big a deal. Moderate retention, good lacing, and low carbonation- not too bad looking. Smells of hops with a strong citrus undertone. Grapefruit, passion fruit, apricot, and some lemon. Sweet malt and a hint of alcohol make a rigid backbone bringing it all together; fruits are really what sticks out here. Taste follows the nose well, strong fruity hop first and foremost. A ton of citrus accompanied with a mild malt mask the alcohol well. Very juicy with a wet finish- nothing special besides that going on here in the mouth. Overall this beer isn't very bad, the balance is way too tilted towards the fruit for me though. I have another bottle I was going to drink tomorrow, I'm not sure I'll pick up any others though. Glad I got to try this"
"Pours deep golden with abundant amber and orangish hues. Two finger fluffy bright white head, above average retention wispy lacing here and there. Big citrus blossom notes, pineapple, sweet malt with a touch of caramel and solvent alcohol on the nose. Mandarin orange, pineapple, continued flora, bready, but lightly sweet malt midpalate. Finishes smooth with some citrus rind bitterness, a touch of spruce, and warming alcohol. Very impressive mouthfeel, creamy, smooth, carbonation is abundant but not intrusive; full bodied. An extremely balanced DIPA that is right in my wheelhouse. Hop Henge is bitter enough to satisfy even the most die-hard hophead, yet is not too overpowering that it would turn off those that prefer less intense DIPA's. Exceptional brew! Count me among those that are very happy it is now available in Illinois."
""
""
"O: What a winner!! The bottle isn't fresh at all, but it's still very nice. I can't wait to try a fresh bottle."

"O: Where are the hops?"

"O - grab one. Fast."

"O: Well, tough to say as this is obviously an old bottle. Very little hoppiness and the rest is pretty generic. I will have to seek out a fresher bottle sometime, wish they distributed here. Having said that, I have previously """Had""" this beer and I rated it a 3.5 (couple of years ago) so I'm guessing that it's nothing to write home about even when fresh."

"Moderately heavy bitterness reliant on notes of grapefruit and pine. The malt bill seems to be tilted towards toffee notes rather than caramel. Decent drinkability. Not necessarily my favorite flavors in a DIPA, but overall a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Good hop profile and bitterness with enough malt flavor to balance things out."
"O- Im impressed by this one, considering that this is an IPA that is past its best by date, I am impressed and optimistic that the fresh version is quite the masterpiece. Wish I didn't find this 5 hours outside of where I live because I want more, and when I find it, I hope its not a single outdated bottle. For those who can get a fresh bottle, I envy you."
""
"Pours a medium amber colour with nice off-white head and respectable lacing. Smells quite floral, quite complex but I can't put a name on any of it. The taste is phenomenal, beautifully balanced malt and hops, despite its bitterness. There's some pine in the taste that wasn't present in the smell. Very dry finish. Overall, this is an excellent example of a double IPA. Good stuff!"
"Pours out a darker (yet clear) orange color with a single finger of stable off-white head, minimal lacing. Smells of candied orange peel, hibiscus, pineapple, and overripe papaya with just a hint of mango. The tropical fruits carry the majority of the flavor, with plenty of caramel / toffee malt to compensate and orange peel coming in third place on the tongue, kicking in about mid-sip alongside a mild sort of peach and nectarine sweetness. Like drinking a fruit basket, but amazingly smooth and creamy in texture, and with a snappy carbonation to boot. Really well done and definitely worth trying."

"O-a solid DIPA, with a nice blend of flavors"

"Thanks Sparky."
"O - Experimental, indeed. This has to have one of the most diverse hop profiles I’ve ever experienced. There are lots hop aromas and flavors to identify. Very tasty and drinkable. I’d say that the spiciness and big earthiness that borders on mustiness cuts down on the drinkability a little, but it’s so intriguing that it makes me want to drink more. Nice offering from Deschutes, and I’d like to try more from them."
""
""
"O: Wow this is a great IIPA. Another A+ by Deschutes."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with an orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is pretty much the same and has a medium amount of bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid IPA with some nice hop aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Huge malt backing to it with barleywine-like flavors, but light enough to stay at DIPA. Still makes it a bit too sweet for my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Ultimately falls a little short of grand. Sweeter than I would like with a hop profile that ends up distracting rather than enhancing. Showcases the Deschutes ability to balance flavors, but the balancing act isn't enough. I had the pleasure of drinking this on tap at one point, it really shines in that format."
""
""
""
"Good beer all around. Lots of nice hoppy flavors with a pretty good balance for what it is. I definitely recommend."
"I've encountered similar takes on this style - very aggressive and very malty. This is well-done for what it is, but it's not my favorite approach to the DIPA style."
""
""
""
"A pretty stand-up DIPA, the bitterness maybe a tad on the waning side, as the BB date is approaching next month, and I'm drinking this an insanely long distance from that lovely Bond Street brewpub I visited last summer. At any rate, this is a pretty damned fine brew, precariously balanced, another of its numerous selling points."
"O: Not a bad double IPA, though nothing about it really stands out too much. Decent balance, decent flavor, a bit too much of an aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - What a solid offering from Deschutes! I love an IPA that's not overly malty and this fits the bill."
"Overall - It definitely got better as it warmed in my glass. Probably the best beer I've had from Deschutes and a lot more west coast in style than their IPA/APA. I'd drink it again for sure, but I'd drink a Sculpin/Pliny/Idiot instead if I could."
""
""
""
""
"T so good! Orange and bitter hops. So refreshing I need to drink this on a hot summer day. Very smooth and refreshing. Although! The alcohol stands out to me. Not a bad thing. My opinion but I know other people would disagree"
""
""
"a very nice big ipa, unique too. only 8 bucks for a bomber at a restaurant, great bargain! pours a sticky bright amber orange color with a delicate but lasting lace white head. smells enormous on the hop front. citrusy, tropical, resinous. flavor is almost backwards experientially, which i really adore in this one. starts off bitter and dry, really powerful, then moves to that pineapple/tangerine sappy sugary hops vibe at the end. this is reverse order from most big india pales, that show their sweet side up front and finish bitter. this is quite the opposite. the alcohol became very prominent as it warmed a bit. feel was nice, big bodied and well carbonated, but filling and strong, not sessionable really. a nice bomber to share over gourmet pizza and mussels. another hit from deschutes."
""
"Maybe I should try it more fresh, but the alcohol was not well hidden. Shame on you Deschutes,"
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange copper color you can tell there are gonna be some nice ibu's in this one just looking at it. The smell is of a nice hop aroma, fruity and piney. Hop bitterness on the back of the tongue leaves a sticky feeling on the mouth this beer really sticks with you and leaves you wanting more and more. Great bitterness and piney flavor. Would easily buy this IPA again and again"
""
""
"It pours out a nice, hazy orange with two fingers of persistent, sticky head. The aroma is full of full, sticky, piney hops with some strong, yet watery grapefruit. The taste is very well balanced, with sticky pine hops and nice caramel malts. The aftertaste is the beer's strongest suit, with a late hit of tropical fruits and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is on the fuller side with an appropriate level of carbonation. It coats the mouth very well. The drinkability is very good. A great first brew from Deschutes. That late hit of tropical fruits gets me every time, and makes this something unique in the DIPA game. It's enough to get a man excited about opening his Abyss in a few months."
""
"O: Amazing on draft just as it is in a bottle. Can Deschutes make a bad beer? I think not."
""
"This was really good. Balanced with hop flavors but not overbearing."
"O: I just love this brew. Drank 3 pints without hesitation. Its a nice take on the hop bomb that is just nicely complex. It does knock me out but i love the fall."

""
""

"I haven’t had a lot of their beers while in Texas only because they were regular go-tos during the better part of a decade that I spent in California. Deschutes, I missed ya. This brew reminded me what I’ve been missing. Fantastic."
""
"O- this is a different kind of beer. Never had an IPA this malty or thick. Pretty tasty."
""
""
"D - Not bad, the hop character is very sweet and matches the malt nicely. The finish is too sugary for my taste and it seems like it would help both drinkability and the hop flavor if it finishes a touch dryer."
"Overall: I actually had this one right after a Pliny the Elder. It is a nice example of how different IPAs can be based on the malt profile. In its own right this is a nice brew."
""

"O-Another good beer from Deschutes. A great all round DIPA, not any glaring holes just a good beer."

"It tastes uniformly great, though. Sweet citrus bounces against more bitter alpha acid nodes, moving into a middle that's more malty with nodes of caramel and dough, ending on sweetly citrusy hop finish that completely belies the beer's high ABV. No thickness issues, no malt syrupyness, and--perhaps most impressive--although it's very hoppy, the hop profile is artfully crafted and so this is not a pallet wrecker."
"Overall: An experiment gone beautifully well!"
""
"O - Great IPA. A nice experiment."
""
"Pours an amberish golden with a thumbs width white head. Great lacing. A sweet and hoppy aroma; some peach, and mango, and a touch of bread from the malt. Not super complex aroma but very enjoyable and that's the name of the game. Flavor has more depth to it. A touch of caramel malt as a base, some fruity sweetness that becomes more present as it warms, some piney bitterness that climaxes into the finish alongside some alcohol. A little sticky but still somewhat silky, medium bodied mouthfeel to this. Another enjoyable brew from Deschutes."

"O: Worth a shot, balanced but with enough going on to make hop heads swoon at the purchase."

"O- a great beer from Deschutes! I love the name and it has a nice bitterness and full flavor."
""
""
""
"Great IPA. Really surprised me, might be my favorite so far that I've tried! Not as different as Sierra Nevada's Torpedo, but not as aggressive as Stone Ruination, or generic.. as say Redhook Longhammer. Just enough bitter, while masking the alcohol content."

""

"More like a barleywine than what I expect from a DIPA, especially one from the west coast. But even as a barleywine, it is a bit heavy and one-noted on the caramel malt."
""
""
""
"Overall I would recommend this. A solid DIPA. Deschutes has made a good one. Hope they keep them coming."
"Overall this is another great brew from a one of my favorite breweries. At $5 a bomber you can't beat the price. While not a complete standout in the now expansive DIPA style, it has few flaws. I will being picking up another one of these. Recommended to all hop heads. Cheers!"
"Medium body with solid carbonation giving it some life while still retaining a bit of stickiness. Semi-dry finish. Overall a very well made DIPA but not exactly a standout in a very crowded field."

"I tasted this beer first at the SLO Xtreme Beerfest. It pours a clear golden color with a white foamy head. It demonstrates good head retention. Lovely grapefruit and candied fruit bouquet. Grapefruit and pine flavors balanced nicely with malt. A very smooth, drinkable IPA with a slick mouthfeel that completes this excellent beer."
""

"An excellent DIPA which I hope will become more available on the East Coast. Very enjoyable, well balanced and easy to drink: a high recommendation, this beer is a winner."

"O - A nice smooth and fairly light hitting double IPA."
""
""
""
"Coppery and clear, nice big, lasting head, good lacing. Citrus and floral notes come up first, followed by some pine. Taste is oily with hops, plenty of citrus, pine, and earthy malts. Body is medium and oily with a slightly sweet finish. Very tasty stuff!"

""
""
""

"Resinous mouthfeel, dry finish. A very nice imperial IPA, would like to see a little more bitter and a little less sweet."

"DOA"
"overall i would rate this as definitely one of the better DIPA's i've ever had the pleasure of tasting. incredibly balanced and delightfully tasty. highly recommended. i'll be sure to revisit this one!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's really tough to tell that this beer has 8.5 abv and 100+ibus. Very understated for such a big ipa. Nice and mellow yet hoppy and bitter. definitely worth a try. Had this a few weeks ago on tap at toronado, hops were definitely juicier and made for a more enjoyable experience, excellent ipa nonetheless."
"This was one that wore on me. Some open up with multiple sips, but I felt like this one's shelf life expired the more I drank it. What started out as interesting and inviting became stale and syrupy. Don't know if I'd get a pint of this again."
"MF- An almost full bodied body, with carbonation that bites at the tongue."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden-orange color with a two finger tall off-white head in my perfect pint glass. Head sticks around fr a bit, but eventually recedes to a film with some islands of foam. Smell is of pineapple, grapefruit, pine, alcohol. In the taste I get a lot of grapefruit. I also get a subtle taste of malt. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin, but that seems to increase drinkability. Alcohol is pretty high, but you wouldn't know it by the taste. This beer was actually a little dissapointing, the hop taste seems off."
""
""
"Overall, I think this is too hop-forward for me to enjoy it too much. I'm all for a double IPA, but the extra hops have to be balanced by some sort of other flavor. To its credit, it does feel lighter than other DIPAs I've had, which can be a plus in some situations. Good beer, could be great with more balance."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine DIPA on the lighter/drier side of the style. It's a good deal drier than their other hoppy seasonals, Hop Trip and Red Chair. I wish Inversion followed this sort of structure."
"Overall; a rock solid ipa, with a good amount of complexity, I feel like this is one that anyone can enjoy and as such I recommend it to everyone!!"
""
"Easy to drink with plenty to enjoy. Solid."
""
"O: This is yet another top flight beer from Deschutes. Love those guys. On a grading scale, probably an A- for me. Delicious. Definitely check it out."
""
"Absolutely, positively, without a doubt recommended!"
""
""
""
"B-"
"A goblet of beer arrived, from the tap, demonstrating an orange amber color with a small amount of foam. A have hop aroma with citrus rind and pine. The hop assault continues on the palate with more citrus and pine. A little raw, a little oily, a fine beer, but not the best I have had of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, slight floral hops, strong sweet malt, slight alcohol, and citrus. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, floral hops, slight sweet malt, hint of alcohol, and slight citrus (kiwi?). Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
""
""
"O- Big fan of this beer. I've had it on tap too. Very good in both servings. My fsvorite IPA from Deschutes. Well done."
"O - Damn this beer is delicious. Deschutes never fails to impress me. Highly recommended."
"Feels mildly carbonated, oily slick, dry to the palate in the end with only a mild amount of alcohol warmth."
""
"This is a very good DIPA...maybe Deschutes will release this bad boy in a 4 pack some day."
""
"This is good! I think I'm going to have to get at least another bottle to enjoy before we move on to the next bond street beer. I almost wish they would put this in a 6-pack instead of Hop Trip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fruit skins, creaminess, lemon custard, blood orange, bitter dandelion stems, woody leafy hop greenery. Alternate flashes of tropical and citrus fruit, making for a complex hoppy brew that lives up to its name. Ends up with a fairly creamy feel, slightly sticky on the lips with a dry whisper of a finish. Pretty fucking nice."
"Over all a pretty good DIPA. Didn't blow me away, but was a nice middle of the pack DIPA with very good balance. The off aroma wasn't enough to really be a damper; seemed to come and go but wasn't overly present."
"Notes: From Deschute's 'Bond-Street Series.' (wondering when I'll find the Bond-Street Brown...what a beer that is...does anyone have access?!)...Ok back to the beer at hand...An absolutely marvelous beer for all the hop-heads out there, albeit very daunting for those who are not into hops to the extreme. For what it is, it's crafted to near perfection. A """Wow!""" beer for sure. 8.5 % abv."
"Reviewed on: 01-28-2011 21:54:14"

"Straight into a pint glass from the bottle. Pours a dark copper color with about two fingers of bubbly, off-white head. Tons of carbonation bubbles in the body, and gives off a very crisp and clean smell that is hoppy but nothing too distinguishable for me. Strong malty taste up front, but goes down smooth as silk. Leaves thick lacing on the glass, and carbonation bubbles stay around for quite a while, making the experience of the appearance very delightful. Very good bang for the buck."
""
""
"O: This beer is very good. It has so many great qualities and wish this was in 4 or 6 packs. Just amazing and I don't know how else to explain it."
""
""
""
"O: Its definitely a solid DIPA and an easy drinker. Not as grand as I remember last years version being, but this is still aces."
"O-This is my second Deschutes offering after Mirror Pond and I was more than impressed by this one"
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass, best by 4/24/12. This pours a nice amber color with a nice foamy white head. The smells are of floral hops, caramel and toffee malts and a little alcohol. The feel is medium. The taste is excellent lots of mouth coating hop resin, lots of bitterness, grapefruit, caramel good stuff."
"overall: good"
"Pretty good offering in the DIPA category. It's not amazing but a solid offering."
""
"O - A great DIPA that has no hint of alcohol, which is pretty remarkable for 8.5%! If this beer were brewed year round, it easily be my go to IPA. Another great brew Deschutes"
""
"Overall a very drinkable brew but nothing groundbreaking in this experiment, the 95IBUs were underwhelming but the hops brought in a unique pattern of flavor. The malt profile could be tightened up some, interesting but I'll stick with Deshutes inversion."
"A terrific IPA from Deschutes that will always have a place in my fridge."
"22oz. bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a reddish gold with a finger of off white head. Big citrus/pine hop aroma also some malt sweetness. Hits you right up front with hop bitterness. Carmel maltiness. Lighter side of medium bodied. More citrus. Drying hop finish. Pretty easy drinking at 8.5%. Lots of fresh hop flavor, good stuff."
"O: A good IPA. A bit earthy for me. Like more citrus in my IPA's."
""
"O: I can never get enough of the bitter hops so this was right up my alley. Great IPA offering, nice bitter bite, will be getting again... very well priced. Keep it up Deschutes."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. Pours a nice light golden hay color. White head, good couple of inches, fades quickly. Clear, fully transparent with descent amout of carbonation. Smell is sugary and sweet. Light, barely any malt back to the aroma. Citrus, and flowers. Very sweet. The taste is crisp. I keep falling back to an apple, and pear flavor. Very drinkable. For almost 9% it's amazingly drinkable. This is by far the best brew I've had from deschutes. Looking forward to seeing what else they have to offer. Did not like inversion too much, this is a huge improvement."
"O: Solid, but a bit too sweet and sticky for me. I prefer a dryer, more bitter IPA/DIPA, but this is still refreshing."
""
"One of the more balanced, less hop bomb incarnations of a west coast double/imperial IPA. Previous versions seemed to have more a boozyness to them but I don't get that as much with the current year's batch. It's an affordable offering (usually $4.50-6 for a bomber) and one of Deschutes' better beers, in my opinion."
""
""
"O - A very enjoyable DIPA. The taste didn't quite back up the nose, but it was smooth and easy to drink. Another plus was the reasonable price for the bomber."
""
"Really good beer, which probably would have been better if my pour wasn’t so bad. Pretty flat when I got it."
"Pours clear, deep golden color with a finger of off-white, fluffy foam. So-so retention and some lacing. Smell is pineapple and caramel, pine, grass, floral citrus, pretty mild but well integrated. Taste is unusual: very earthy pine, moderate caramel malt backbone, with moderate-high bitterness which persists on the palate. Medium body and carbonation. Overall, an above average, interesting IPA that's a little on the bitter side."
"O: An extremely good beer. Get it before it's gone."
"Overall - This is a good hoppy beer for hop heads. Sharp and grabs your attention. Lost track of what my girlfriend was saying every time I took a swig from the glass..."
""
"Overall: While I enjoyed this, I would say that nothing really stuck out to me while drinking it. I expected a more complex beer that was more about the hops, not the malty sweetness. In any case, still a good offering from Deschutes and worth a try if you enjoy higher abv IPAs."
"O: This is a well-made IPA, with great balance and character. The malts and hops work very well together, making for an easy bomber to take down."
"Overall: This is a must try DIPA if you can get it fresh. I'm glad this one is a seasonal release. I'm also glad this is a rotating beer for them in that its a different recipe each year just like BBXX series. Good job Deschutes."
"O: Very impressive """experiment""". I think this should evolve into a permanent offering. Keep it up Deschutes."
"Not the same hop profile I remember. Do they use different hops each time? This one seems slightly oniony. Thick, creamy,"
""
"Overall- Decent IIPA. A little on the sweet side for me. I would like the hops to shine a bit more. A little too heavy for me as well. 3.5/5"
""
""
""
"O. Very good beer. The smell preaches high and it comes through with the promise of sovereignty. I highly recommend this beer to anyone. Fresh is great, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
""
"Overall; seemingly the best of the 3 annual releases I have tasted, but then again I only have this beer once or twice a year. If it's available, Hop Henge is a no-brainer and worth a try especially for the average price-point of 5 bucks or less..."
""
"Overall a good balance between plentiful malt and hops - but everything doubled. Maybe a little on the sweet/malt-forward side for my taste, but a solid DIPA nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Deschutes has brewed up another great beer. This is a very drinkable DIPA. It's well balanced but still gives you plenty of hoppy bitterness. Seek this one out."
""
"I'm really happy with this years offering, the best I've had in line of the series. Really hope to see this in sixers (as I had heard a rumor). If you can get your hands on a fresh bottle, do it. While there is a hint of potential esterification in here, overall it's really a nice offering."

"A very balanced IPA. Nice enough to drink but it lacks the massive hop kick of something like Pliny."
"O: An easy drinking Double IPA for those who enjoy their IPAs with doses of malt and citrus hops. Luckily, I am one of those people!"
"O: Another great beer that I hope to have again fresh (my bad) even though it was still great, if not different, several months old."
"a nice IPA, not mind blowing but better then average. I got this bottle In San Fran months after the release so that could skew my review"
"O: Awesome Imperial IPA. It's a month past the """best by""" date, but still incredible. I am sad that I'll have to wait until next January for more."
"O - Would love to try a fresh bottle, but even well past the best by date I really enjoyed this one."
"O- Excellent display of brewing innovation and mastery. Extremely drinkable for an unabashed high-octane hop-bomb."
"D- Very tasty, but watch out for the alcohol. Probably won't pick it up again, but it is worth it at least once."
"O- Good DIPA. Very easy to drink and refreshing."
"Not a bad beer but not one I would buy a case of."
"O: This one really drinks quite well. I would say all in all the sessionability is hurt a bit by the lack of intensity. There's a lot of delicate fruitiness that is intriguing in the first few sips, but after a half-glass you wish the volume was turned up a bit. Other than that, I think this one is pretty yummy. Despite my slight gripe with the flavor, I don't think anyone can deny how refreshing this beer is. I smack my lips together after every sip. Deschutes wins with an experimental IPA worth savoring."
"O: I like this beer! I've been really curious to try this out of Deschutes and I wasn't disappointed. Everything about it is worthy, and if you're searching for a new kind of IPA that doesn't suck, then this is one to pick up."
"O - Not a bad DIPA, but not top notch either. I bit more bitter/malty, and less crisp than I'd prefer it to be."
"Amber color, rather hazy and almost no head. Very nice aroma of woody hops, caramel malt, some alcohol and more floral hops. Quite a nice flavor as well. Plenty of sweet caramel malt, followed by the piney hops and a nice, dry finish that manages to stay away from harshness. Pretty full body, but slickly smooth and clean at the finish. A very nice experimental IPA."
"Decent, beer, could have upped the early hopping and malt and I wouldn't be complaining. I'm not actually complaining though."
"Overall: Pretty good, but I expect more from Deschutes."
"Overall I seemed to be the only one that actually liked this. These more common Deschutes bottles seem to be a good value as well."
"A decent brew, but with some odd twists. I'll put it down to the """Experimental""" in the name, and be content with that."
"PP (Price Point) --- $6 for a 22 oz bomber thats 9% to me is a great deal, especially when its a damn good beer like this one!"
"I am really glad I got to try this... on tap in Minnesota no less! Pours a nice copper-amber color with moderate white head... very fine bubbles in the head with decent lacing. Nose is pretty freshly hoppy, with citrus zest and some fresh citrus leaves (does that make sense?) coming to the front. Flavor is pretty good, though I suspect it has mellowed a bit during its trip from Deschutes to Minnesota. It kind of reminds me of my homebrewed Furious clone, which is good for me, but potentially not so good for Deschutes. A bit on the sweet side, not as bracing as I might expect. Overall a pretty good beer, though, one that I was glad to try!"
"O- Really great beer, very drinkable and really great hop bill chosen for this beer. Right now it is the best DIPA I've had to date. Gonna have to trade for a lot more next year."
"O - what think and IIPA should be like."
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. Not excellent. I would drink it again but maybe would have my expectations a little lower."
"O- a delightful beer that would be a good drink at any time. I would always like to have a few of these in my fridge."
"O: Wish I could get more of this beer. Would buy regularly"
"Quite a mouthful, but everything works. Nicely balanced. Not sure why this is dubbed 'experimental' other than the floral and earthy tones, but it's tasty nonetheless."
"This is a nice IPA. You get the full good flavor of an entire hop cone. It is smooth going down as well."
"Overall done really well. A true tasty west coast 2X IPA."
"O - This is a very good double IPA. Like all IPAs I'd imagine that this would be incredible when it's super fresh. It's a little aggressive on the hop side of the flavor profile. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, though you really expect it to be a bomb with such a strong hop and malt presence. I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"O: Good not great but Its nice to drink a bit IPA which isn't malt dominated."
"Drinkability: A delight for hop lovers. This is right up there with Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA as a great example of the style. For a beer with 98 IBU's, this one is not overly bitter at all thanks to the great balance of sweet malts. A very good beer than is very easy to session with. Another winner from Deschutes!"
"Overall impression - it's pretty decent but the hop profile seems odd."
"Clear amber-orange pour with big two finger head with great retention and crazy lacing. Fruity, candy sweet, malty nose with hints of orange rind and pineapple. The taste is much the same. It has a unique something about it that I can't really put my finger on. It's extremely rich and sweet, almost to the point of being a bit syrupy. Lots of pineapple with hints of caramel and an odd soapiness. Piney, bitter hops attempt to balance out the sweet malt, but come up short. Very thick and chewy mouthfeel that I typically love, but the sweetness coupled with the soapy aftertaste really kill the drinkability for me. This isn't a bad beer, but there's something about it that just rubs me the wrong way. It's got a lot of good qualities, but enough little issues that I really can't give it more than an average review. Really had high hopes for this beer and it really let me down..."
"Overall, a great DIPA. Not as insanely hoppy as some, which I appreciate. The hops are always kept in balance, making this a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Dangerous at 9%. Like Hop in the Dark before it, I wish this was a year-round beer; but it's not, So I'll take it when I can get it."
"deschutes brewery hop henge IPA the appearance is a dark brown with a honey amber hue. the head is light and almost pure cream. which dissipates after a few moments. the Aroma is sweet and powerful (as with all IPAs) which becomes slightly intoxicating to the nostrils. the taste is bitter and hoppy at first but quickly becomes a fusion of sweet bubbly caramel and smoke. which finishes with the traditional IPA lingering that leave you craving for more.. if you can find this limited treat I recommend you don't hesitate to indulge in its enjoyable aura. and with an ABV of 9.0% it has a bite to go with its bark. I recommend enjoying this bad boy with your favorite starch or cheese. described by the brewery as experimental India pale ale!"
"Overall - Well, I gave it a 4 on everything, and that's probably descriptive. It's good, but sweet. That's really the only off-putting characteristic about it."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one and could easily drink a couple bombers. It's not my favorite Double IPA...but if you are craving a DIPA with really fresh hops, a pleasing bitter finish, doesn't dry out your palate, and can hide 9% ABV, then you should give this a try. Cheers!"
"O - Much maltier than most IPA's and a little too sweet for my personal preference. Pretty darn good overall though."
"The pour was very nice with a rich light golden amber. Smooth and very cloudy, this thing looked like it was about to kick my ass, and as I was about to find out, it was defintley going to. Lots of ripe grapefruit and pineapple hops that just tore through the air as soon as I leaned in to it. Huge notes of hops dominated the entire flavor as well. Sharp flavor here as the resin like hops took all the moisture out of my mouth and left me parched, dry and looking for more. One of the best finishes I have had in a big IPA in a very, very long time. I would love to try this one again and will defitely be on the lookout to try it again."
"O: Must re-review a fresher sample to know for sure."
"Pours a dark orange with a thin white head. Nice aroma of citrus, oranges, hops and some sweeter fruit. Taste is very good, more orange and now some pineapple as well. This is a much sweeter DIPA then I have had, but for my taste I like it. Its still got a nice little bitter bite to remind you its an IPA, but the overall beer is a sweeter more citrusy DIPA. I like it a lot, as it prooves not all DIPA's need to be giant hop bombs."
"Pours a reddish-orange with a nice whitish head that leaves lacing all over the place. The nose is a soapy, candy-orange-vanilla hop-malt combo. Don't like the soap, love the rest. Never really smelled an IIPA like this before. A low-key hop flavor with just a touch of citrus balances well with a low-key malt flavor. Finishes a lot dryer than expected. Pretty mild in flavor, with just a touch of that soapiness. There is something else in there I am having trouble identifying. Gum is the best I can come up with. I can't seem to describe the flavor legitimately in a positive way, yet I don't think it is bad. Definitely interesting and a bit different than most IIPAs. The mouthfeel is right on, good carbonation and a reasonable amount of residual sweetness. I'm giving it an overall bump because I like it more than the taste rating impies. Certainly not amazing, but not poor by any means, and kind of interesting."
"Overall-- the beer would be fine if it didn't have these wierd off flavors... I'm not a fan of this at allright now."
"I thought it was a little too well balanced between the malts and hops. It's a tad sweeter than most imperial IPAs. Despite this it's still a very well crafted brew that is worth the price of admission."
"3.5 D: Pretty good beer. A solid, maltier DIPA. This would be pretty fabulous if the sugary sweetness was knocked down a notch or two."
"DELICIOUS, GET SOME!"
"A good DIPA, but not one that does anything overtly special. It's certainly a good beer, it's just that the DIPA arena is now so full of world class entries, this one just doesn't quite find its way in."
"I need four more letters, I wish I was made of feathers."
"D: A decent and not-boozy DIPA; another great offering from the folks at Deschutes"
"O: Overall, this is a very nice beer. Great hops flavor with mild sweetness to balance the bitterness. Easy to drink, but not too thin feeling. I will buy more."
"D-Good Stuff! Would definitely like to try this fresh, but I'm not complaining about this bottle."
"Overall: I would drink this all year if I could. The only thing slowing me down on this one is the 9% ABV, but hey, every once in a while, you've gotta let it fly."
"Poured a dark honey color with a thick white head that floats atop the beer for a good while. Carbonation bubbles race to the top as the head diminishes. A great lacing is left around the rim and sides of the glass. This beer is the standard on how a DIPA should look. The beer smells of citrus, tropical fruit, and bitter hops. You can definitely smell the 95 IBUs. I taste bitter hops, grapefruit, and a hint of caramel on the back end. Well balanced carbonation and great texture on the pallet. Overall this beer is a great example of the DIPA style. I think Deschutes hit a home run with this """experimental""" beer and this should become one of their regular offerings."
"Poured an amber color from a 22oz bomber into the trusty shaker. Nice sticky head and lacing that stays a long time. Caramel, malt, and citrus on the nose; I could also tell by the smell that it would be """kinda""" hoppy. Taste is definitely what it's all about: sweeter malt up front, caramel and some citrus (grapefruit?) with a nice bittering end without the """I need to scrape it off the back of my tongue""" that some hoppy brews give ya. I'd had this one a couple or more years ago and got another bottle just to see if I liked it more now since palate has grown. Answer is a resounding Yes."
"O: this is an excellent offering from Deschutes."
"Drinkability - outstanding stuff. A great sipper to have on hand while I sit through some online training. Thanks to BGThang for the awesome hookup!!"
"Overall I expected more from Deschutes. I personally thought it felt a little over carbonated. I was not as bitter as what I had hoped. I would take a Stone Ruination over the hop henge any day. Not a bad beer at all, just not a good as I had expected it to be."
"A big and well done double IPA. However, hop-wise, it feels a bit like a one-trick pony. I could have enjoyed some hop spice (Simcoe?) to counter all that floral/perfumey hops and malt sweets. So, one full glass is plenty for me."
"As with lots of big beers, drinkability suffers a bit from being so much to take in. Still enjoyable as any Deschutes beer would be and glad to have tried it."
"Unusual, but pretty good. It drinks very easily. There is no sign of that 9% abv."
"(22 oz. bottle). pours an orange hue with a nice chunky head. Citrus aroma is strong. The hoppy mouthfeel is expected, but after I swallowed the beer a sweetness came to the forefront to balance out the hop punch. A really nice beer! Deschutes make some great beer."
"Huge, highly agitated and delicate head, mostly larger bubbles with noticeable thin skins as it were, retention is okay given this observation, the lacing is more like big splotches here and there than streaks. Crystal clear light amber to redwood color, hue drops off enough at the rims to evoke more of a metallic rust orange, only a few bubbles floating around. While the nose does present a pinch of white pepper as well as moss, tar and something like volcanic ash, truly it's about being as sweet as possible, caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate team up with orange and grapefruit pulp to fill up your nostrils, the apricot, peach, pear fruit verges on syrupy with a touch of honey, given all this curious lack of staying power. Full-bodied with a sticky, clingy mouth feel, as if it wants to glue itself to your mouth pores. The carbonation is weak, if remaining at a consistent low drone. More bread, pie crust accents here, some custard as well in addition to the base of butterscotch, caramel, coconut and molasses. The tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus wet, juicy and equally sticky itself. Touch of golden raisin and fig to the pear, peach, yellow apple, mango fruit, lacks the tang to get more tropical. The pine element is mostly resin and sap. Its density starts to fatigue the palate once you're halfway through the bomber. Tempted to say it's one for the real hopheads among us but the sweetness factor flies in the face of such a statement."
"O: Pretty good, even though it's a bit past its prime."
"Hop Henge is definitely one of the sweeter West Coast DIPAs, which I like. A bit more complexity would bump this one into the next level."
"as usual, even for an IPA, these kind of Imperial/Doubles really open up as the beer warms."
"Hell of a solid brew and a great price too! $4.98 a bomber is a excellent deal for this Deschutes beauty."
"O: We thought it was an excellent double IPA, especially for the cost."
" ~ This is a good beer and one that I would recommend to ny friend that enjoys a good imperial IPA."
"Overall. Really nice west coast dipa. Smell is amazing, tastes pretty damn good too."
"bomber from the Liquor Store in Jackson"
"Overall this is an extremely well balanced and pretty drinkable DIPA. Very surprised to see that the ABV is 9% as it is very well hidden. Definitely an enjoyable beer."
"O: Excellent taste, exceptional mouthfeel and just an overall amazing experience. The only thing I'd change is the intensity of the aroma. Everything else is top notch, I just want to smell how amazing this beer is more than I am."
"This isn't a bitter-bomb but the hops provide alot of juicu fruit flavor. Alcohol is heavy in the nose but doesn't come through when drinking it. Very good."
"o - deschutes is rapidly becoming my favorite brewery as i explore their catalog. another really impressive beer. this is kind of like hop in the dark without the dark. has a nice vanilla almost oaky quality to the hop flavor. i really enjoyed this beer."
"Hard to drink a lot of as an IIPA; split among friends. Very well crafted. Decrease the abv to around 7.8% to let the hops shine a bit more."
"The CPJ"
"M/D: medium mouth feel with a crisp carbonation that helps cut the bitterness. Alcohol is only mildly apparent. This beer is well balanced. An awesome representation of a NW IPA."
"Great tasting American double imperial pale ale here, super easy drinking too. Really like it."
"D - At 9% this stuff is incredible! The ABV is very well hidden, the flavours are bold yet nicely balanced. The sweetness makes this one unique, and the hops would be well appreciated by any hop head. If you can find a bottle, be sure to grab one!"
"D: A decent double IPA. Nothing worth seeking out but if you have a buddy who has a bottle. Ask him to share."
"M/D: Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Overall it was solid, have had better, but have also had a lot worse. Liked the flavor with the apple."
"T: Sweetness upfront and a peppery hit of hops followed by some biscuity malt flavors. Finish is pure hop bitterness. Good but not great."
"Drinkability: It's been awhile since I've had a Deschutes beer and even longer (1 year?) since I've had Hop Henge. I guess the tried and true beers get overlooked sometimes. Deschutes, I'm sorry I've neglected you for some time...it won't happen again. If you haven't guessed, I like it and you should try one when you get a chance."
"D - A nice Imperial IPA. Somewhat on the heavy side, so 1-2 would be my limit with this one during a session, but the quality is apparent."
"D - 'experimental' is a nice qualifier for this brew, while having a pleasant hop character, the black licorice flavour is very unique and dominating, even if a little out of place, props for taking a chance, and very drinkable at 9%"
"A florescent orange with a an almost pale peach foamy head. The nose is fantastic and pronomintly pine scented. There is some citrus in the background and a bit of vanilla. The taste has a nice mildly bitter, boozyness about it. A little bitter and then a sweetness on the finish. Creamy and fairly dry there is a nice change from nose to taste to finish. This is a superior brew and at 9% sneaks up on you quickly. Deschutes does it again."
"A clear copper color with a fair off-white head and very good lacing. The aroma offers mild citrus grass biscuit. Nice but slightly mysterious. The flavor says honey grass and a touch of pine peanut. Grass dominates with a scintillating carbonation in a medium bodied brew. There is a slight alcohol note with lemon biscuit. The feel is slightly viscous with very subtle carbonation. Fair drinkability. Not in my wheelhouse for an IPA but a decent version worth a try."
"This is quite an amazing IPA; high on the experimental scale for sure; would love to have it again. A real find!"
"For a high hopped beer with 9% alcohol, this one sure is a wolf in sheep's clothing, it could sneak up on the best of us. It's very easy to drink, the flavor isn't so strong to steel the taste buds of the tongue, but more than enough to hide demons."
"D: Good show for a hop forward DIPA. Very tasty and drinkable for this style. Lots of hop oils and higher abv make this an occasional one for me."
"D - a flavorful beer, 9% ABV is not readily apparent"
"Big thanks goes out to futura123 for this brew in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured red-orange/amber with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and grapefruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The alcohol flavor cuts out the nice flavors on this one unfortunately. Had a great aroma going on here. Good flavor as well (minus the alcohol aspect). If the alcohol aspect was covered up a little more with some sweetness this one would have been awesome. Still pretty good and really glad that I got to try it. I suggest you do the same..."
"Pours a clear golden-amber color with a large white head (with a hint of orange). Scent is very hoppy with citrus and melon aromas. I also get a bit of strawberry in the nose as well, which is interesting and inviting. Taste is VERY sweet. Maybe a little too sweet. I get citrus flavors (grapefruit and orange) as well as some melon and strawberry. I could see why this is known as """experimental""" as it is different than most DIPAs I've had. There is less bittering hop flavor than expected. In fact the hops and malt seem to balance each other somewhat. Mouthfeel is nice, but a bit on the syrupy side. Drinkability is sort of high as this is a tasty beer, just some things are different. Definitely not one of the best attempts at a DIPA though."
"Drink is decent, fairly bitter but not too much, it doesn't dry like I expected it to and it stays sticky a bit on the finish, the hop and malt character are balanced well, especially with that vanilla and oaky-like rounding character, but being 9% if def drinks better than that."
"D- Remarkably drinkable for 9% ABV. Glad I traded for this one."
"Pours a deep gold with orange tint, frothy head that clings nicely. Aromas are muted, nice piney hops but a cardboardy smell. Flavor is nice, but the malt profile seems stale, hops are present and has a nice level of bitterness, but the cardboard comes back in the finish. A solid Deschutes offering but not my favorite."
"ABV is really well hidden on this one. There is a bit of a sting on the finish, but it is flavor more than booze."
"D- Very solid beer, super smooth for the 9% abv can't taste the alcohol at all, also very refreshing."
"D - Despite this beer's non-ideal taste, it still tastes pretty good, and is pretty good for drinking, therefore."
"Drinkability: Only one bomber of these in an evening for me, thanks. It's a beer that doesn't sneak up on you, the thickness of the body and the sweet malt on the palate makes it a beer that would be hard to have many of. However, this was a great tasting, and if Deschutes starts distributing in my neck of the woods it would end up in my crate again."
"i had no idea this was a DIPA until i went to review it, however it makes sense. my only complaint is on the flavor, it seems like its lacking some depth. for a DIPA, it comes off as a bit older."
"D: I was expecting a typical over hoped American IPA when I picked this out, boy am I glad I was wrong, this is an increadable IPA."
"And, as it turns out, an excellent companion to a mid-winter game of disc golf in the great NW."
"D - High! What an awesome beer. Considering this managed to make it from Oregon to New Jersey and through the frigid Midwest and might (?) have frozen along the way this is great. Definitely a bit of alcohol taste that lingers but an overall great DIPA."
"D: Quite refreshing. As I've said many times, it tastes like a sweet orange. On a nice warm day like today, this is hitting the spot and is very drinkable."
"Bottle stamped with Best Before 3/29/11. Red tinted amber. Slowly rising bubbles are constantly surfacing. I didn't have a good pour so the head is a little small, but that was my fault. Aroma is as balanced as one can get. Citrus hops, pine, honey, zesty peel and even some sweet sugar tickle the nostrils. Flavor-wise, there is a bite from the hops but a sweetness from the honey. The 9% ABV is masked by all the great character going on here. A slight amount of acidity rests in the stomach and gives this a heavy punch, which it should since it's a DIPA. 9%, can't tell from taste and hasn't hit me yet. Another great job by Deschutes."
"The nose explodes into citrus fruit, a little grass note and some sweet malt. The taste is strong hops, more citrus that continues from the nose and a malt sweetness. There is a little too much carbonation for my taste, but does little to distract from this great beer. All in all, this is a great beer that I would recommended seeking out, as fresh as possible of course."
"D- I was excited to try this beer and it didn't disappoint. I love the orange presence which you don't find much in a lot of IPA's."
"Overall this is a great DIPA. The bitterness is never overpowering but the ABV creeps up on you if you consume too rapidly. The beer itself is very complex and interesting; highly recommended."
"This is a medium bodied offering with modest to light carbonation. It is lightly prickly on the tongue. Very drinkable and well balanced. The alcohol was not hidden in this brew but it was well incorporated. Worth a try for sure."
"Pours a reddish orange with lots of nice head. Great head retention and nice lacing. Smells very hoppy... Lots of grapefruit and citrus on the nose. Tastes strongly of grapefruit. Is a really well balanced beer, hops and malts couple nicely. Good mouthfeel and solid carbonation. A good beer"
"D-wouldnt guess the abv on this at all."
"Poured into my Dfh snifter, about 3 fingers of head that receeds, leaving crazy lacing on the glass. Smell- deep pine, grapefruit, citrus, and some alcohol notes. Taste- bitter hops, followed by a sweet tropical fruit flavor, mixed with some nice alcohol burn. This isn't as well balanced as I would hope, and the alcohol isn't masked well, but its a massive hop bomb and I do enjoy it."
"D: I would say that this is now my second favorite Deschutes beer... right behind """The Abyss.""""
"Mouthfeel is pretty thick and sticky with just the right amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable for the style and I'd happily try it again so long as it's fresh."
"Mouthfeel is very good, with the lemon citrus leading to a dry finish, but the stickiness being very pleasant as well throughout the drink. Drinkability is excellent for the abv of 9%; you never want to stop drinking this. Very, VERY good offering from Deschutes."
"D-Another fine seasonal in Deschutes Bond Street Series. I wish they would do this in 12 oz. six packs."
"The beer pours a deep amber color and has a great grassy sweet hop smell with a hint of lemon. I was a bit disappointed at first sip when the huge hop profile I was expecting wasn't there. It was malty and sweet with a subdued hop profile. Now, after drinking more the genius of the beer shines. The hops appear to take over and dominate throughout. Now don't think i am saying this is all hops and nothing else. What I am saying is the hops are on the front of the taste and remain through the finish. Bitterness appears non existent considering it claims 90 or 95 IBUs. Very balanced drinkable beer for 9 % abv. Panty dropper for sure. All in all this isn't my favorite IPA by any means but nonetheless delicious."
"Well, tonight was our home brew night. we sipped on a few good ones. I already was a fan of deschutes black But Porter. This IPA was impressive. Poor orange/dark red copper full body. Head falls pretty quickly to live a nice lacing on the glass. great aromas on pine resin and some delicate citrus notes that make very refreshing to drink.Invites you right up front with the bright and rich hop flavors that lingers to the back with a great bitterness. Again, rich and luscious on the palate. No problem getting this one down. A overall extremely well crafted DIPA that has left me with a wish for more. I just got to get myself up to Oregon one of these days for a super fresh one of the brewery's tap. Enjoy."
"D - Moderately drinkability, good for a DIPA. Is becoming a little bit filling as I go through the bomber. The assertive bitterness is becoming a bit tough on my tongue. The beer itself is very complex and interesting for one."
"I would give this a pretty high drinkabilty. I could see myself easily knocking a few of these out in one night. I would definitely buy this again."
"D: I really enjoyed this DIPA a lot! My only regret with this beer is that I am not in Deschutes' distribution to go out and get some more!!"
"Poured from 22oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a crystal clear orange body with a medium-thick, off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma of bright citrus and floral hops. Light amount of sweet caramels and hops. Flavor is quite piney up front. Surprised me, but not in a bad way. The big but sweet pine taste lasts throughout and well into the finish, but a good amount of balancing light caramels even this out. Very floral, sharp, and astringent. Palate is medium bodied and oily before an extremely dry finish with a spicy, sticky, strong hop taste that lasts for a very long time. Overall, a very interesting IPA. Lots of sharp hop taste, but surprisingly nice balance throughout. Powerful and """immense""" is an understatement."
"D: A version of the DIPA that was a little too much on the malty side for the sytle. Still, a well make drink that I'm glad I hoisted."
"Overall: Experimental is appropriate for the name on this. Heavy body and high carbonation, along with a complex flavor development, make this a brew to try once and you can decide for yourself. I liked it!"
"Drink- I thought this was a new beer, got all excited, had it the fridge for a couple days, get it cold, pour and notice the best by date. Still tasted pretty good but would like to get this fresher. I am sure the flavors would be very good."
"d - I enjoyed this DIPA and liked the caramel malts in the taste. I think the malts helped smooth out the mouthfeel as well. Would like to have again."
"My impression is this is a double red-IPA crossover. Very interesting and quite flavorful. I could see this as a polarizing brew due to an abnormal flavor profile for an IPA. There really was no taste of alcohol despite the ABV, it was either well blended into the flavor or just drowned out by the robustness of the profile. Certainly not the easiest to drink but definitely a worthwhile beer to pick up."
"Deschutes Brewery--Hop Henge Experimental IPA--Bond Street Series--Experimental India Pale Ale--2011 22 oz. Bottle. 9.00% ABV. 95 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) IPA--Imperial. Dense mild lacy light orange head. Clear rich bright amber color. Malty smooth sweet hop mild grapefruit pine front. Smooth cloying mellow sweet rich malty caramel earthy hop resin hint breadfruit body. Smooth balanced mild bitter hop citrus lingering malt end. Sampled 1/23/2011. Purchased for $5.59 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 12/9/2010."
"D - Drinkability is very good but it would be nice to experience less alcohol presence and more body. Overall, I really am enjoying this beer from Deschutes."
"(2011 vintage)"
"Other then the sugary sweetness this is really easy to drink, it's not that it's incredibly malty or unbalanced it's just that the malts themselves have a flavor that makes me think of refined sugar, it's not grainy or bready like I would prefer."
"D: I'm never one to walk away from a beer and I certainly didn't with this one, but really had to power through to finish it. I won't be drinkin this one again."
"D- Overall a pretty decent brew with a nice hoppy flavor. A bit boozy but fairly well balanced."
"D - Easy to drink and lovely. Goes down easy and it disappeared fast. No hints of alcohol, which it hidden well for the ABV. This almost feels like an Imperial Hop Trip"
"D - Decent drinkability. ABV isn't noticeable at all. The only thing I find wrong is the carbonation."
"I like DIPAs so tried Deschutes version. I like it, pretty nice balance for a DIPA in that it has a little malt sweetness come through. A nice beer, I'm more likely to have it again on draft since it only comes in 22oz bottles though."
"D: The balance of hop and malt gives this beer a very drinkable taste, however the hops are not as present as I was thinking they would be. I do love the flavors and aroma here and would definitely seek this one out if I had the chance again."
"Drinkabilty: The brew has a nice combination of flavors but runs short in its drinkability and ability to desire much more."
"Verdict: Well worth the price and a pretty good beer, but shy of great or elite. Worth trying if you see it."
"Pretty solid, very juicy, aroma a little better than taste, but very drinkable."
"As an Oregonian, I'm puzzled why I never got around to our locals-done-good sooner. Better late than never! A must try for any hophead, and even non-hopheads may be surprised by the drinkability. Another superb effort from Deschutes."
"D- Fairly high. While not in the upper echelon of WC IPAs, it holds its own and is a damn good beer. If you can, give it a spin. Another good deschutes beer."
"Overall: I was expecting more. But honestly, while it's not bad. It's not that exciting either."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle(thanks brewnic) into a snifter. The pour is red/orange with a sticky 2""" white head. It leaves a ton of lacing. The aroma is typical DIPA, sweet pine/ grapefruit. Upfront lots of sweet pine with grapefruit pithe and light tropical fruit. It finishes with lingering grapefruit and hints of alcohol. The beer is medium/full in body average carbonation and has the slightest hint of alcohol. A solid DIPA, not quite at the next level."
"Very dry, medium mouthfeel. Not much carbonation detected. Though this is a nice, balanced beverage, I feel like its a sipper, to be enjoyed over a long period of time."
"Overall I'm very pleased with this beer like I am with most beers from Deschutes, especially for the reasonable prices that they charge. I will buy this beer again."
"D - Drinks super easy for a DIPA and reminded me of a normal IPA, that being said it left me wanting a more hopped up brew, this was super balanced though. I could drink these easy, but I like more of a hop bite or alcohol taste in there for a DIPA."
"This beer pours a nice, medium copper colour with very slightly off white rocky head. Very good lacing. The smell is pine forest with citrus (grapefruit, lemon). You can smell some caramel malt in the background. This is one unique and DELICIOUS beer. It is a hop bomb that knocks your tastebuds down but not out. Chewy citrus of grapefruit, orange and clementine meets up with the piney bitterness and are well balanced together. In the back you get the caramel malty sweetness coming through. Mouthfeel is a bit tacky but not bad. I could drink this beer easy every day. A fantastic beer, up there with Dreadnaught for me as one of the best. Highly recommended."
"This is one of the most balanced DIPA's ive ever tried. Similar to avery's maharaja in many ways as far as balance and big ipas go. so damn good..."
"Decent DIPA, but not great; could've used more sweetness to help balance things out."
"drinkability - the hops and malts add a nice complexity, i prefer west coast hop dominating ipas but this one is nice and i can appreciate it"
"D- Really easy to drink. I wouldn't turn this one down if it ever pops back up."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is between light and medium with great feeling carbonation. Drinkability is very good. This beer is 9% ABV and it doesn't feel like it at all. Another good one by Deschutes."
"Drinkability: No evidence of the 9% ABV. Very nicely balanced. Excellent and way too easy to gulp down."
"Glad to get a fresh bottle.Poured into an imperial nonic a brilliant burtn orange with a large sticky white crown that settled slowly leaving broken globs of lace behind.Big fruity hop,overripe pineapple,grapefruit,and tangerine aromas abound overtop of a healthy caramel malt base,no alcohol really detected.Citric fruit flavor with not a real bitter edge to the hop profile,not as sweet as way to many of the style are, although there is a caramel sweetness to it,the alcohol stays pretty well hidden for the style but is noticeable.Big and fruity with not really any stinging alcohol,Deschutes kicks ass."
"Overall, a very nicely done DIPA and at 4-5$ a bomber you cant go wrong. It's not up there with the best, but certainly worth trying."
"Outstanding balance of flavors, completely disguised ABV, and a real treat to drink. Another winner from Deschutes!"
"Overall: A great beer that drinks like a one in the 5% range.  A delicious hoppy beer and the best I've had on this short trip. This destroys Green Mammoth."
"D: Pretty good drinkability. Its a strong DIPA with a lot of hop oils. You can tell its 9%abv."
"Drinkabiility-Lots of flavor make it great to drink. 8.75% ABV limit drinkability somewhat. A great beer."
"Not top shelf. Keep experimenting, Deschutes."
"Very pretty orange-amber with an off-white 1""" head that quickly recedes to a thin cap. Smell is mostly piney, zesty hops; pale malt shines through more as it warms. Taste follows smell, with more of a creamy, biscuity malt undercurrent. Insanely drinkable for a double IPA; I would put this somewhere in the hazy middle ground between single and double. I had the pleasure of trying this baby on tap the day after release and it was divine. Bottled version doesn't quite hold up, even fresh."
"It's not Pliny, but an excellent, refreshing west coast DIPA. Thanks, Jason!"
"D: it drank really good and was quite light in flavor leaving me to believe that it could easily become a session beer; still tasty though."
"Pours a deep orange colour with a couple fingers of foamy white head and nice lacing. Smells hoppier than it should for a bottle past its prime, with a lot of caramel malt coming through. Flavour still has a bitterness punch you'd expect from a double IPA. I'd love to try this one fresh, but still really enjoyed this."
"Golden yellow, 3 months past expiration but only received it in last few months. Carbonation bubbles. Almost a half inch of white foam bubbly head. Lacey, hop aromas are hard to distinguish. Taste held together, initially good hoppiness taste for 95 IBU, palate filler not a shredder. Creamy above average mouthfeel, creamy but also oily. Booziness builds up, so the drinkability is good but not great."
"D- The next morning my buddy and I did mention that we remember this beer and at the time we really liked it. I remember it was nothing to over the top but a good solid beer. Good beer to share with good friends!"
"D. Drinkable. Drank within the best by date but the hops seemed to have faded away. Still has the bitter finish though. Not exactly what I look for in a DIPA, but still good."
"D- I can't find anything wrong with this, but I am not in love. A little on the rich side for the alcohol content and style. Good beer, cool label."
"Overall, a very good DIPA that I wish I could try fresh. I'd expect it to be one of the best."
"Pours a dark orange amber with a thick vanilla colored head. Smells like a hop bomb, taste is more complex, quite a bit of malt discernable, this is surprisingly sweet, the pine and citrus hops are predominant but not overwhelmingly so. While some DIPAs with strong malt/hops balance don't work, this does for me, the sweetness and bitterness integrate well with the hops playing first violin as they should. This beer is heavy yet smooth, something to savor."
"D - Drinks very well with alcohol definitely in the background."
"D: Would drink again for sure"
"It's an imperial all right. I liked it and I would recommend it to complement a dessert or any kind of spicy food. Random, but this beer will pair well these foods since it is sweet, but not overpowering. Enjoy."
"has the proper color of an imperial... lipton lemon tea color. with a small white head. nice lemony malt bit o honey nose. a thinner palate than expected of with a nice sweet ester quality. this would be a fantastic beer if it has more malt to sit on. it lack the frothy body and yeasty earth and for some could seem syrupy."
"Drinkability: The biggest fault in this beer is that it has trouble hiding it's alcohol. Other than that, this brew is a great example of a super hopped up west coast DIPA, overall excellent."
"Drinkability: Very solid beer that I would drink again if Deschutes ends up coming out to Philly full time. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Relatively so, though there is a somewhat noticeable alcohol bit that is not really boding well with me right now. To think PtE is less than a percent lower than this and there is zero noticeable alcohol, whereas this is currently warming my throat and stomach. Not a bad beer by Deschutes, but not something I would pick up again."
"D Probably one of the most drinkable 2xIPAs I've had. four of us finished a growler before we went to dinner and would have probably had another with dinner if I had sent more back. Although I liked the other two Deschutes offerings that I shipped back I wish i would have sent more of this home."
"D - An insanely drinkable DIPA that I was available to me on a regular basis... Perfect balance... Perfect feel... Oh so good..."
"One finger white head, relatively quick dissipation with above average lacing. Clear orange amber body, multiple streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Big hop hit upfront in the nose, citrus and piney resins, caramel malt sweetness for balance. Huge hop attack on the tastebuds, grapefruit and some tropical fruits guava, caramel malts in the middle, and a quite bitter noble pine finish. Mouthfeel is medium not sticky, above average effervescence. This is a quite tasty and drinkable DIPA."
"Poured bomber into my DFH snifter glass. Deep dark amber color with 1 finger head. Nice pine smell, caramel/toffee, and a bit of grapefruit/citrus. Taste has a nice bit of pine, maltiness and a hint of grapefruit. It's a hoppy beer but not a hop bomb by any means, well balanced. Really nice mouth feel and great carbonation. Its a big dipa abv wise but drinks like a much lighter beer. No hint of alcohol and very enjoyable. Drinking 2 bombers of this would be an easy task. Very well done by Deschutes."
"I definitely enjoyed this one. I consumed it about 2 months after the best by date so I'm certain some of the fresh hoppy characteristics have vanished, but what remained was a very enjoyable beer. I'd love to try a fresh bottle. Go get this if you have access."
"HV"
"Very strange IPA, that I'm sorry to say, I just don't like. It smells good by itself, looks good (has great head actually), but the taste... Starts out with some malty goodness, then comes the hops, which ain't that bad either. It's mainly floral tasting, which I'm not a big fan of, but not overwhelming. Then comes the final aftertaste. I don't know what it tastes like but it doesn't taste good and as I'm smelling the beer while taking a sip, the taste worsens."
"Wow. This beer was on tap at Sea Salt Eatery and it went along fantastic with my calamari tacos and tilapia tacos. The pour is almost a copper color and the hops aromas hit hard. I couldn't stop smelling this beer, let alone drinking it. The aroma is strong and citrusy and very hoppy. The taste is a bit fruity, very hoppy, and surprisingly does not kill your taste buds. I really, really loved this beer. The ABV creeps on this one. I was well aware of the 8.75% in this one, but it still crept up on me. Deschutes really did well on this one. One of the best IPA's I have tried and possibly the best double I've had. Great beer."
"The hops impart a true bitterness that the malted biscuits (from the small) can't cope with and the beer just becomes 'yet another hoppy beer', one of too many I came across during my road trip to the US. The alcohol comes through towards the end of the taste, but otherwise it could have been almost any IPA based beer I came apon."
"Overall I would have it again especially for the price. Not a crazy hoppy as other beers of the style, and because of the maltiness it comes out much more balanced the other DIPAs while retaining a lot of hops and a high IBU. Good beer and an interesting take on the DIPA style."
"Libation: What an impressive beer! Aggressively flavorful, bitter, and the best balanced DIPA I can remember. A great offering from Deschutes."
"Bomber poured a dark amber into a Duvel tulip with a two-finger head which quickly dissaped. Lacing was ample and lasting. Nose was biscuity and sweet malts and some citrus and floral hops, though subdued for what I expected. Not a lot of carbonation is visible nor affects mouthfeel or taste. Mouthfeel was medium, not terribly oily and almost chewy. Taste was well balanced, some citrus (pineapple, lemon, orange), some hoppy bitterness giving way ultimately to a syrupy sweetness. It's maybe a bit to cloying and sticky for my liking but all-in-all a decent, well-balanced brew."
"Good drinkability, a fine example of the style from Deschutes."
"Great head. incredibly solid head with epic long lasting lacing. Dark golden tinged orange in color reminiscent of a good level of malting. Smell is hoppy as to be expected with a taste slightly more complex than the nose. The beer is good but nothing that is making me rush back for more at this time. A solid brew but not my favorite of this type."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing I want very much of or something I would get again. Nothing seems to work for this beer. I was expecting more hops, considering it is from the west coast."
"Goes down quite easy and is an all around enjoyable DIPA. For under $6/bomber, a good bargain as well."
"D: Easy sipping beer that i feel i could enjoy a bomber of without a problem."
"D- would have this again./"
"I can describe the taste and mouth in two words: smooth, and luscious. The hop and malt bill seem very well balanced, and well integrated, oodles of flavor but never overbearing. The session man's DIPA? If that seems like an insult, it isn't. It is remarkably easy to drink, malts sweet and covered in caramel, juicy grapefruits and hop oils all rolling together. It warms, but the higher alcohol does not sting or burn. It coats the mouth, oozes into every awaiting cranny, very smooth and velvety. In sum, its lovely."
"So close to perfect it's stupid."
"Medium-full body, with moderate-to-high carbonation. A little thick, and slightly heavy on the palate. Alcohol hidden well. Overall, a slightly different take on a big IPA...more malt presence than expected but gives it an interesting character. Certainly one I'll have again."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip. This bottle says best by 6/24/10. Nice head formation, lacing, and retention. Deep amber color. Bright, fresh hops with sweet, malty notes on the nose. Full bodied and almost syrupy with a fairly prominent malt profile whose sweetness compliments the hop bitterness by making them seem lighter (fresher,sweeter) on the tongue. This is how I like my double IPAs. Big and bold hops balanced with malty sweetness. The only drawback with this is it can take away from the drinkability. I've had a few that drink more like a barley wine than an IPA but this one walks the line pretty damn well. I think Hop Henge has just cracked the top 5 of my favorite imperial IPAs."
"Shimmering copper body with a bubbly ivory white head. Teh beer drops sporadic rings of lace as I drink. Aroma is nice and fresh. Bright citrus with lemon and lime leading the way. Mango, pineapple and papaya as well. Love the aroma. This is my kind of DIPA. Great hop flavor. Bright citrus with grapefruit pulp and tangerine and lemon and mango. Bitterness is fairly clean. A little rough around the edges, but not much. Moderate body and a little prickly carbonation adds a little scrubbing action. Alcohol is ghostly. This is quite drinkable. Similar to Dreadnaught. Right up there. Very close to, but not quite... Damn fine beer though."
"D - A nice sipping DIPA but I was expecting something different knowing the style and region."
"Drinkability: I'd have another!"
"Nice beer with a unique and tasty non-hop-bomb take on the IIPA style. Really like it; wish I could find it closer to home!"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink for a DIPA, with a fairly strong flavor profile. A too sweet body and light aroma prevent this from being as great as many other Deschutes beers."
"D - Pretty harsh for an extended session, but great for those times when you just need 95 IBU's."
"overall: its a real good beer I would like to try it more fresh and re review this and I will do that asap still its a good beer and very enjoyable I am a big fan of Deschutes they make good beer that is for sure."
"The Hop Henge IPA pours a brilliant orange color with a nice frothy head that bubbles over the edge of the snifter glass. Very nice lacing along the glass. Nose is semi sweet with a nice hop presences. Characteristics include orange, pines, and some toffee. Taste is amazingly good. This isn't an in your face DIPA like some can be but the taste is extremely smooth for the moderately high ABV. Plenty of citrus fruits followed by pines and a bitter hop finish that leaves the palate craving more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the hop presence dances on the palate. I really wish I could stock my fridge full of this DIPA for the summer months. Wonderful IPA from a great brewery."
"SkÅL!"
"Taste: Really well balanced and distinctive due to its rich, ripe fruit flavor. Sweet, ripe prunes up front that mix with a unique citrus/herbal bitterness and brown sugar. Highly carbonated. Kinda like a sweet, herbal syrup."
"Medium bodied, low carbonation, Has a moderately bitter aftertaste. Definitely worth buying again."
"Just an additional note. This year's offering is just a bit sweeter but still a top notch brew."
"Poured from a fancy growler, I'm sure the handle makes a difference. Anyways, this is a great example of """balanced""" DIPA that you can enjoy without having your tongue shredded by bitterness. Not this brew still has close to 100 IBU's, but it's a smoother bitterness that lends to the delicate fruit flavors. In fact, this beer is almost a little juicy, thanks to the pineapple and citrus punch hops. Check this beer out, it's a great DIPA to have around."
"D - This is an exceptional DIPA. The balance makes this one easy to drink. Before I realized it half my glass was gone! I will jump on any chance to have this again in the future. This is definitely near the top if not at the top of my favorite DIPA's. The things I would do to be able to get Deschutes in SC!"
"D: ABV is completely hidden, and as much as any DIPA is drinkable, so is Hop Henge."
"Without a doubt my favorite IPA ever. The smell is piney without masking all of the malty goodness that signifies balance to me. There is some grapefruit citrus, florals, and the pour is just silky looking. I could smell this one all night but I'd rather drink it. SO well balanced. If you haven't tried this one go out and get a bottle. I did, and then I got 3 more."
"D= A good drinking IPA. The only problem is that I'm drinking it in the land of Furious. I may go back to this one from time to time because it is very good. If I wasn't in Minnesota I would drink this whenever avalible. Very fresh and crisp IPA."
"pours a a very nice peach/ orange color with a 1 finger fresh head and lots of sticky lacing on the glass..the smell is tropical fruit,, pine citrus, and malts,,the taste is great it hits you with mango and hop/grapefruit upfront and other citrus tastes then the pine /hops hit you with citrus and bread tastes..malts round this dipa out with a sweet finish..this is a solid dipa and if this is an experiment then you passed..it has a full mouth feel with oily hops and well balanced malts this is a highly drinkable iipa and one of my favorites from the brewery that just came to MN..highly recommended"
"I didn't expect this from a brewery of the reputation of Deschutes. This """Experimental IPA""" recipe needs major tweaks if it wants to be anything other than a flawed experiment."
"Notes: I was excited to try this one, and while not quite blown away, I wasn't let down. This is a tasty and remarkably distinctive DIPA, with an admirable balance of equally assertive malt and hops. As a fan of flavor in general, I'm a fan of this beer - I'd really love to get my hands on a super-fresh bottle. Thanks to Phoenix2443, and cheers to all!"
"Drinkability- About as high as I could give a DIPA and that is because it does not punish the palate while giving the full hop experience."
"D: I could have quite a few of these, the big hop flavor my get in the way of making it a session beer, but it is a quality IPA."
"Tastes great, I will be buying more. Priced here in MN at only $5 for a bomber, to me thats a hell of a bargain for the amount of flavor and aroma delivered."
"Drinkability is good. Solid IPA."
"Deschutes has finally made it's way to Minnesota and this is the first one I picked up. Pours a clear orange color, bordering on amber, two finger white head and sticky rings of lacing all the way down the glass. Great aroma on this brew, plenty of orange and citrus notes dominate, not much in the way of malts. Flavor follows suit. Big time hop flavor, citrus and pine dominate, but there is a nice sweetness in the background. Bitterness never becomes too much. Honestly, I've gotten out of hoppy beers as of late and don't care for them as much as I used to, but this beer reminded me of my initial love affair with Two Hearted and Unearthly. Great Stuff here, alcohol becomes a little too noticeable as it warms up however. Medium full body, but the sweetness starts get cloying and sticky as get to the bottom of this bomber. Great beer, and this one shouldn't be experimental anymore. Keep this recipe, Deschutes, because it's delicious."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin white head; a thin cap leaves sticky lacing down the glass. The smell is marigold, violet, slight orange peel twist. The taste is very floral, with some savory notes and a mildly bitter finish. It's thick, mildly carbonated; very nice. A sipper, but a good one."
"In the end I would say give it a go its good, not the best but well worth the money and in no way will it disappoint."
"D: The beer is rich and delicious, it begs to be consumed and savored--but the high abv (while not inappropriate for the style) is a limiting factor. All of the attributes of this beer combine together to provide an extremely rich and satisfying double IPA. It reminds me of the Shipyard XXXX IPA, which I tasted for the first time recently. It is not as overtly piney as a special brewery-only version of Hop Henge that I tasted at the Deschutes pub in Portland last summer."
"D - Not bad...though there are better IPAs."
"Experimental? Well I think this experiment is conclusively a good one and should be brewed again!"
"22oz bottle. Deep bronze, almost orange color, with a thick, creamy off-white head. The nose if full of huge hops, citrus, grapefruit and pine. On the palate I notice some sweetness, but again mostly hops--orange and grapefruit. Nice mouthfeel. The alcohol in this one is well hidden, making this one dangerously drinkable."
"D= Highly drinkable despite the huge ABV. I would drink this regularly if I could."
"I had put off buying this for one reason or another for awhile and I must say I regret it, because although it is no """take-all""" beer I am very happy with it and hope to have it again, and I'm glad the ABV isn't any higher because it is an incredibly drinkable beer."
"Pretty drinkable, but a little bitter, even for a DIPA. The best DIPA's exhibit their hops as tropical fruits, not so much as bitterness. Hop Henge definitely gets the tropical fruits across, but it is a bit excessively resiny. It is still a must try for fans of the DIPA style."
"Poured into a Bernardus chalice, this is a nice orange-tinted amber beer with a small head. The nose is pleasant, full of resinous hop notes, but it's not particularly big for a DIPA. Excellent flavor, though, with very high bitterness, a lot of citrusy hop flavor, sticky sweet malt, and a nice fruitiness at the close, along with a lignering dryness. Alcohol is detectable but does not detract. Big bodied--I assume it's all-malt."
"Overall this a very nice beer that I would like to have again."
"Taste, the alcohol is muted moreso, very bitter, very citrus, good bite, tastes like more of everything compared to the original Hop Henge. Great mouthfeel, citrus hop gives way to more immense bitterness. Drinkable, good price curve on this stuff."
"This is a good DIPA. Nothing all that special, but solid (like pretty much everything from this brewery). Worth a try, especially for the hop heads."
"The abv does show up slightly with a light alcoholic burn. Other than that, I loved this one to the last drop."
"I am pleased with this beer and hope Deschutes continues with their great beers in the coming years."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable--the alcohol presence is very low for the ABV, and this one's good enough to make you want to finish the bottle pretty quickly. The one thing that inhibits this is the heavy aftertaste, but it's still extremely drinkable. While I probably wouldn't try to trade for it a second time, I think that if I were somewhere it were available locally I would definitely have it again without hesitation."
"Drinkability: A reminder of why my favorite style is and likely always shall be the DIPA. The hop profile on this one is pretty thorough, hitting all the highlights - citrus, flowers, herbs, leafyness, pine - and then some. I wouldn't have guessed a simple combination of Centennial and Cascade (from the Deschutes website) would produce this robust a hop flavor, so I'm pleasantly surprised - it's good to know simplicity can still produce such complex results. A very solid DIPA at a stylistically-reasonable 8.75% abv, Hop Henge is a beer worth seeking out, particularly for fans of the style."
"D: Deschutes makes some of the most drinkable beers with the most intense flavors. This is another fine example of what they are capable of."
"The taste is more of the same, sweet hoppiness up front, fading to a more bitter feel as it rolls across the palate. A very nice DIPA, but not the best I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel delivers and slightly redeems. Hop bitterness is all over this puppy to the point where your teeth feel gritty and you get a twinge of acid reflux quenched by silky smooth liquid with a medium body and sizzley carbonation. All in all a decent beer slightly lacking in the nose and flavor departments. There is a best by date of 04/16/10 which I'm well within. A shift of some bittering hops to the flavor and aroma side of the boil would make this one a lot more satisfying."
"Impression: Deschutes needs to start shipping all their fantastic beers to NY pronto!"
"Sorry this is long, but I really liked this one..."
"D: a bit too harsh on the back end and too little character for the style on the front end"
"D - This is a nice drink to be sure... well done."
"Body is crisp and firm, but there is a light oily feel on the back end. This isn't as hoppy and bitter as I would expect, but it is delicious. Bittersweet grapefruit right away, with a light graham cracker in the middle. Mild bittering finish. This isn't anything that'll knock your socks off, but it is what it is: A well-made DIPA that I could have most any day."
"Overall: Good, very similar to other Deschutes IPA/PA's. Don't remember the rye-like spicy presence from last year, but it's still good."
"Creamy and mouth enveloping feel. Medium carbonated and a medium body from the residual sugars. Very sip-able for a high ABV beer, but lack of hop flavor makes this brew less crave-able."
"Great IPA/DIPA that doesn't seem to get as much press as the others. Recommended if you are a fan of big hoppy beers."
"This is a monster IPA, but sometimes bigger is not better. The hops are overwhelming of the delicate citrus flavors. Good flavor and well balanced on the finish, but a little restraint could go a long way. Inversion and Fresh Squeezed IPA came out the two winners with this a close third in our tasting."
"Golden honey amber color, quick fading fluffy white head. Smells like a bag of citrusy hops, with hints of tropical fruit, like pineapple. Delicious bitter hop bite, with adequate malty backbone to back it up. some caramel, biscuit, and citrus. alcohol makes itself well known, but not overwhelming. Once again, another solid offering from deschutes!"
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy dark amber color with a decent, frothy off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet malts, caramel, grass, grapefruit, pine, and citrus (tons o' hops). Flavor is caramel malts, sweet and fruity, oranges, grapefruit, and some pine. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, sweet (almost cloying), but balanced out with a hefty amount of bitterness. Good IPA, one of the sweeter ones I've had."
"This delicious medium bodied brew rolls hops and malt so well together you would never guess it was packing 95 IBU's. It seems so well balanced. Only towards the end do the hops seem to separate from the malt and leave you with bitterness. Tasty candied citrus and fruit flavors appear, disappear and reappear throughout. The high alcohol is noticeable but not to the point where it detracts from the overall experience. A restrained bitterness lingers in the finish but does not overpower."
"Thanks Toby for one hell of a box! First class."
"The beer pours an orange color with a nice sized white head. The aroma is pine, resin and some grass. There are definitely tons of hops in this one. The flavor is resin and pine with a lot of spices. Medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I might be spoiled with Founder's, Short's and Bell's right in my own backyard, but I want this brewery here too! I've only had a few of their brews but they've all been solid examples of the styles. Thanks again, Toby, you have just become my official Deschutes hookup!"
"This poured a slightly hazy light copper, with some light tan head. It smelled like herbal and pine hops, with sweet honey malt and orange zest and grapefruit. It tasted like herbal and pine hops, with some grapefruit and sweet honey. It was fairly thick with light carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very bold and clean hop scent and taste, and great body too. It didn't quite have the tropical taste that I personally love in IPAs, but it was still quite enjoyable. I didn't even realize this was a double IPA until seeing the listing online, so the alcohol was definitely well hidden. Very nice for the hop heads."
"another sold offering from deschutes...havent been let down by any of their beers yet...thanks again to james for another great package...cant wait to finish this trade out."
"D: average drinkability, not sure i'd want more than a bomber or two pints of this."
"Pours a vibrant copper pour. Strong hops, spicy notes, pine and citrus in the aroma. Some caramel as well. Taste is spicy and citrusy hops, orange peel, pine, caramel, sweet malts, and hops resins. Bits of toffee also. Body is chewy and resinous. Strongly carbonated with a medium-full overall feel. Ends with more citrus notes, hop resins, pine, caramel, sweet malt and toffee. More spicy hop notes here too."
"Drinkability: dangerously drinkable. My first exposure to this beer was having three pints at my local pub, not realizing the beer's imperial strength. Great stuff."
"D: This is one of the more fulfilling, more satisfying DIPA's I've had in a while and I've been drinking some of the best of the season. I hope they continue to brew this one and hope even more that Deschutes distribution is expanded to PA. Incredible brew already, no need to twerk the recipe."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a smootha mount of carbonation and a crisp, dry finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer, but I really love all the sweet fruity hoppy beers. I wouldn't really call it balanced but it leans in the direction that I really like. I love this style IPA's that seem to be so common out west and so few out east. Would definitely buy again if it was distributed here."
"D: okay, not bad, but not my favorite"
"Overall this was very nice DIPA and my first ever beer from Deschutes. Thanks again Seth for the opportunity to try this beer and for throwing it into our trade as an extra!"
"Overall, this is on the heavier side of IIPA, not a """crisp""" beer. But it is a must for any true hop head. particularly enjoy the mix of hops used as it doesn't dominate in any particular strain but the overall flavor is great."
"D: I'm not a huge hop head, but I found myself liking this beer quite a bit. The high ABV is almost completely masked, which really enhanced the speed with which I ended up drinking this. Another solid effort from Deschutes."
"Great IPA, quite enjoyable balance. Despite being almost too sweet, this brew grows on you."
"Highly recommend."
"Was so excited when I put this on tap. I was able to score a pint near my sister's house in bend during my last visit and fell in love with this brew. Nice dark rich look with heavier fruit notes than a normal dipa. All the guys at the bar love this beer but the 8.75% sneaks up on you if you're not careful. Overall, I would keep this on tap year round if I could."
"D- if you like fresh hops, give it a check-plus on this grade"
"I had some quarters left and a craving for something strong, so I went to Fred Meyer to see what they had. I found this for 3.89 a bottle. Took it home and slammed down a gulp. There's just enough bitterness to make it hard to slam down, but then it settles in with a nice friendly hop aftertaste. Then a minute later the active ingredient kicks in with a nice glow. Normally it takes me a couple hours to do a bottle of Arrogant Bastard or Lenny's RIPA, but this one has gone down fast. Be careful. As with the recently superseded Hop Stoopid, you should buy cases and cases of this to get you through the current economic downturn."
"Super drinkable. Juicy, bitter, refreshing. If you are a hophead: Take a ride on the Hop Henge's Merry-Go-Round of Hops! You won't be disappointed."
"This beer is why Deschutes and most of the other above premium West Coasters micros, in it for awhile breweries can hold their heads high and feel like they started this thing, the big hop, big bodied beers that everybody east of here is trying to be. This is big hops with the perfect balance of malts, making this bomber at 8%+ go down smooth like candy. What seperates this is the balance of the beer, hops, malts, then a nice dry hop finish that lingers. Not to boozy, but also there to punch you in the nuts to let you know what's up. Good stuff, kinda pissed I left it in my fridge so long to be possibly stolen from my drunk friends."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Deep golden appearance with light head that lingered perfectly. Aroma was sweet, floral, with subtle citrus backgrounds. Taste was perfectly balanced between bitter hops and sweetness. A hop-forward beer, but smooth and refreshing in finish. Body was medium, carbonation was prominent and fresh. A refreshing IIPA that leaves that perfect light bitter aftertaste."
"d- this is a must try for the IPA fan, and stands as an excellent example of the style."
"Amazing I found it at Santa Monica Liquor for $3 a 22 oz Bottle today, 11/6. One of my favorite Deschutes Brews, next to dissident!!!"
"Doesn't tastes all that hoppy for an IPA, but it is very spicy in mouthfeel and has lots of nice bitterness. I'm not sure what is experimental about it... it's just another pretty good IPA."
"From notes. Clear, active, deep copper with fluffy white head with a bit of retention. Very attactive. SMELL huge bouquet of citrusy, spicy and floral hops blend and balance enticingly with an assertive maltyness. Some booze too. TASTE citrusy and floral hops, sharp bitterness overpowers strong malty sweetness that balances fairly effectively. Bitterness lingers, and some dryness in the finish. FEEL med carb and fiz, rich, full body, warming and a drying bitter finish. OVERALL an honest attempt is made to balance this classic example of the Great NorthWest Hop Bomb. It was a staple over the summer when it was here. Also very reasonable at $5.50 a bomber, even all the way up in the northern most reaches of southeast Alaska. A worthy brew."
"Overall, I was impressed with this beer. For the ABV, I don't get any hints of the alcohol. The hop character covers all of that up pretty well. If I could find it out my way regularly I would definitely buy this one again."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a creamy white head that is long lasting before creating a nice crown of foam atop the glass and leaves nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is citrus hops and citrus hops in their freshest form. Wow. The flavor is more of that citrus goodness and is zesty and bitter with a semi-dry finish. The body is full and mildly carbonated. This is some potent stuff. I really feel that their should be separate ratings for each of the versions since the hop characters of each are different and meld differently with the malts and have highly variable ABV's. This is certainly my favorite version and is highly drinkable."
"Ps - every time I put """bready""" in my iPhone it says """breast""" LOL"
"drinkability: goes down very easy and doesnt have any heat. a must for all hop heads or just fans of ipas in general. hopefully this one comes around again."
"D- very good. have bought many times."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is smooth, astringent, and rich. The body of the beer is medium to medium full. This is a wonderful experiment by Deschutes. Its flavors are uniformed the malt gives this beer a very good backbone. Enjoyed drinking it."
"Bond series out of 22oz. bomber. Pours a dark amber with a head the size of the liquid. Excellent aromas and flavor profile. Malt backbone props this up, and some nice bitterness on the finish. I didn't know what to expect on this one but was pleasantly surprised. Similar to Smutty Big A. Much better than some of the west coast hyped up IPAs as well."
"M/D - not an over the top DIPA, but nicely balanced, lots of flavor and just the right about of bitterness"
"D- This is only a one beer at a time beer. I enjoyed it a lot but it's a little too much to drink more than one of. I would love to drink it again if I had the chance."
"Verdict: Hop Henge is a tasty and quite serviceable Double IPA, though I might stop short of calling it """experimental.""" A definite pickup for the hopheads."
"Would recommend any hop head try. Not one of my favorite IIPA's but still a very good beer."
"medium body, with faint resins throughout, peaking towards the finish. lightly prickly, moderate carbonation."
"Notes: This is a pretty darned delicious brew! Fresh hops taste clean and spicy, while they deliver an acidic bitterness that would jolt a dead tongue back to life! The malt barely manages to poke its head through the wall of hops in the middle of the mouthful, and that's about it. If you like sweet, easy-going, well-balanced DIPA's then this is not the one for you. As for me, I really liked this one!"
"Overall: Good drinkability despite strong alcohol presence. The bitterness is a bit harsh and the spiciness doesn't work very well with the other flavors, but comes close. The aroma is pretty harsh and takes away from the beer for me."
"This is a pretty good Double IPA. Not the biggest or hoppiest but still very good."
"A solid and delicious beer, for sure. Again, I'm kicking myself for not drinking this sooner, but it still maintains several layers of complexity even this late. At 8.75% ABV, you could probably sit on this guy for several months, but I wouldn't recommend it. Drink it fresh if you can. Another hop-head's love affair."
"Nice clear tawney reddish amber. Two finger head just doesn't want to lay down and when it finally does it leaves a nice firm sheet of lace in its wake. Herbal tea like hop aromas and a kick of phenol aromas. A nice battle of citrus, pine, and herbal hops fend off a toasted bread and caramel malt backbone. There are some rye like spicy notes. Not sure if rye was used in the malt bill. Finishes with a nice lingering herbal tea leafyness. Somewhat bitter finish, but not over the top. Surprising for a beer approaching 90 Ibu's. Nice full and creamy body. Alcohol is present in a warming spicy manner, but certainly not overstepping it's bounds. Yeah, this one really kicks! Glad I finally got a chance at this one."
"Well crafted beer, retaining their signature without going overboard on the hop astringency or bitterness. Not quite mind blowing but very good."
"Part of our shipment from Liquid Gratitude. Overall a very nice beer, amber in color with a nice head. Aroma was spicy with some malt. Flavor was malty up front with hop bitterness in the finish. Body and carbonation were both medium. It was a drinkable beer and I would definitely drink it again."
"Overall a good DIPA, but not up there with the best of them. Too much alcohol and the sweetness was a bit cloying at the end. Shame, I really wanted to love this beer."
"D - This is another fine Imperial IPA. It certainly is a hop forward one."
"M + D: The carbonation is rather prickly, but it doesn't have a big sparkling sensation or foaminess to really make it stab at the tongue. Rather, it's a tingle, and it suits the rich body well... it's nice and full, a little thick, even. Even with a little heft in the body, I find myself sipping away quite quickly... the flavour is divine and it is rightfully among the top DIPAs I have had the opportunity to taste. Excellent beer."
"M- not quite full-bodied, and lots of carbonation."
"D - Pretty drinkable overall, although i definitely wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting. Not bad at all, just not mindblowing in any aspect besides the smell, which was quite nice."
"Overall a very interesting brew from Deschutes. While many DIPA's focus on florals, citrus, pine, or even booze, this one takes it in a slightly different direction and does it well. A welcome change of pace. If this were a year round offering it would almost certainly crack my top ten DIPA's and get a semi-regular rotation in my fridge. If you see this one, try it."
"By the time I got to the bottom of this glass I was frankly bored with it. Somewhere between nose and mouth this beer gets lost."
"Drinks well enough...gets a little heavy after a while, but that's OK. After a while the rind and creamy malt give the palate a boozy little beatdown that leaves it staggering a bit, but it comes up from the standing 8-count and hangs in to finish the fight. This overall seems like a successful collaboration. There's balance in abundance; maybe not an incredible amount of synergy or new ideas but it works well enough. Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts? Who knows...but sometimes...who cares? It's good."
"Drinkability: Nice IPA. Will drink again!"
"I love the blending of flavors, and the great balance here. This IPA exceeds expectations, and honestly - it reminds and resembles the upper echelon of IPA's. This is a damn fine brew, with really no faults. Amazing all around!"
"Drinkability: This is one powerful I2PA. A hop-head's dream. As for me, I dig it, but it's not nearly as complex as I'd like it to be. A couple months of aging might do this one some good. EDIT: It does smooth out toward the end of the sesh. +0.5"
"Mouthfeel was smooth and rounded. Medium in body."
"Drinkability is good. This is a pretty bitter IPA, but very fresh, with nice hop flavors. I really enjoy Deschutes offerings, but I have always thought that their IPAs weren't quite as good as the rest of their beers. But this one is a keeper. I wouldn't mind seeing this as a year round and in six packs."
"D--Very good DIPA that I would buy again if I had better access to it. Drinks very easy without much bitterness, but doesn't have that WOW factor to make it stand out among the absolute best of the best"
"*see code of 021 09 now that I look. If that's Jan '09.... then perhaps this faded a bit."
"D) Yum. Hard core beer, you've got to love the hops to break into this. I can predict some hop withdrawal symptoms in my future, better stock up on some more."
"WOW-what a hop bomb. Pours a dark copper red with a rocky off white head. Pine resin hit me as I went in for my first sip. Initial malt sweetness, but then finishes with a silky smooth piney, hop bitterness, that lingers long after the beer is swallowed. The hops dominate this beer, which is fine by me-and I also appreciate that this beer is also a malt bomb. Drinkability is very good in part because the mouthfeel is slick from the hop oils which fill the mouth with lusciousness."
"I felt it was quite balanced all around and easily drinkable. I'd return for another without hesitation"
"Taste is loaded with hop flavor and bitterness. Resinous tropical flavors assault the palate and finish off dry and bitter with a mild alcohol bite that feels nowhere near the 8.75%. Full body nears the point of syrupy, and there is a decent dose of balancing malt that adds a touch of honey-like sweetness in mid-palate. This brew is pretty drinkable and does not seem as bitter as the 95 IBUs the label claims. Im not the biggest IIPA fan around, but this beer is one of the tastier versions I have had. Very smooth and has a flow to it rarely found in hop bombs, it does not have the rough edges found in many versions of the style. Another winner from Deschutes!"
"Hop Henge is not the standard West Coast, overly-hopped, in-your-face IPA I'm used to drinking. But it is quite an extensive, easy-to-enjoy brew. Its aromas and flavors are not going to get in the way of simply enjoying this brew on a hot summer's day (or a relatively cool, almost-summer's-day such as today). Definitely something I'd look for again!"
"A worthy double IPA from Deschutes."
"I have found my DIPA... for now... in a 22oz seasonal available January through April... Well, maybe I'll enjoy the other Bond Series IPAs"
"D - The drinkability is incredible, but you have to be careful with these. They are awfully strong."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - Highly drinkable. The first one went down quickly and could have easily had another."
"D) This is the palate equivalent of a Metallica Concert. Don't be expecting to taste anything else afterwards. It's a great beer, but I'm not gonna drink six of em."
"Overall this is a good DIPA, but it seems to have too much going on to be very good. Still, it's worth a shot to decide for yourself."
"D - Deschutes has done well with this DIPA. An impressive array of hop flavors in a very palatable brew. I picked up a bomber and will have no trouble finishing it all. Were I at the bar, I'd be glad to order a second or third pint. Alcohol is well-masked but creeps up on you as the session endures."
"D: pretty good,"
"Pours beautiful clear amber with thick good-looking head. Pretty too look at. The best part about this beer though is its aroma. Just plain hoppy goodness. Citrus with some pineapple, maybe a touch grassy. Screams hops for me. The taste is kind of peel-the-roof-of-your-mouth hoppy. Wonderful if you're a hophead. Good hops, but there is quality malty base there too. My glass is a probably a touch too warm, but it is still very drinkable and with a pleasant mouthfeel (for an imperial IPA). Alcohol is not obvious. Medium body. Excellent if you want some quality hops."
"D: Dangerous. And considering that the bomber was under 5 bucks I'm tempted to go back and buy as much as I can get ahold of! If your a fan of I2PA's you have to get your hands on this!"
"Beer poured into my Kapittel Watou chalice is translucent and forms a 2 finger off-white head. Beer is a lovely burnt orange color and leaves rings of lacing as you suck it down. Nose is pungeant with a pure floral hops aroma. Taste is well balanced through the start and middle with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and the beer is quite easy to drink. I really enjoyed this one and I'm not a huge IPA or DIPA fan. Another worthy effort from Deschutes."
"nice"
"Pours a reddish brownish color body. Small white head, diminishing, clearish. Bitter dry hoppy aroma, pine and citrus. Extrmemely strong aroma. Nice taste, nott too bitter, some maltiness and nuttiness too. Some piney taste. Dry aftertaste. Pretty tasty, but too sweet an IPA for me."
"Poured out of a 22oz bottle into my Duvel glass. Beautiful burnt orange color with a nice looking one inch head. Lots of hops in the aroma. Grapefruit dominates with some other citrus in there. Not enough hops initially but it creeps up to you and ends beautifully with perfect hop bitterness. I think that's why I love this beer because of the way the hop flavor creeps up. Enough malts in there to keep it well balanced. Another good beer from Deschutes. They never dissapoint me. Glad we are getting this in texas now. Still my two favorite DIPAs are FFF Dreadnaught and Southern Tier Unearthly."
"D: it's good but almost too sweet for this boy. i'd like to see the carbonation clean the tongue and the bitterness to sink in more"
"on a side note: I dominated a windsor knot while drinking this, so if you cant tie a tie, drink this and you will be able to."
"D: I think the well balanced factor of the hops and malt make this a super drinkable DIPA, maybe even moreso than some of the hop bombs that I love. There is a little alcohol flavor in there though, which takes this down just a notch on being able to session this."
"95 IBUs and 8.5 % ABV could spell over the top but no; this is one of the most balanced, smooth and luscious Impy IPA's I have had. Pours quite dark with a massive head. The nose is pure hops but with a lovely refined presence. The beer is very smooth with lots of hops backed with lots of malt. I loved the way the beer melded together into one mouthfeel that showed the brewers art. One of the best Imperial IPA's I have tasted"
"D: It's a good IPA, but not great. I prefer my IPAs to lean toward a crisp citrus flavor, so part of my reaction is just bias talking. I liked the beer but I don't feel compelled to seek out a second bomber of it."
"Great Beer!"
"D - I normally prefer citrusy hops over piney hops but this brew is still very impressive. A very complex and rewarding beer."
"D - Our thoughts: Somewhere a beer deity thought up the perfect IPA, and it was Hop Henge, the people saw it was good and there was much rejoicing."
"In a word, this one's outstanding. Hop Henge is proof that Deschutes loves us and wants us to be happy."
"Pretty, hazy, brownish orange in the class--deeper color than most IPAs--almost a barleywine color. Head disappears very quickly to a small ring around the edge. Smell is clean with subtle hops. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy and soft--really great mouthfeel! Taste is nicely balanced with toasted malt and hops. I'm not sure what is supposed to be """experimental""" about this IPA, but the experiment seems plenty successful to me--nice beer."
"Great IIPA. Just lacking some of clean, bright hop character found in the best IIPA's."
"While I tend to enjoy the sweeter DIPAs, I don't like that sweetness in the finish. That's the only downside to an absolutely stellar brew."
"This is a nice beer. A good balance, some nice flavors, a good pepperiness. However, it's not totally lighting my world on fire."
"Fantastic beer. Long live Hop Henge! I'm only sad that this is the only bottle I had in my possession, now I need to go get more."
"The smell was sweet condensed hop goodness. The malt profile shows up right away on the first sip. Good malt backbone. Grapefruit hoppiness makes its presence known. Bitterness lingers on the tongue with a slight burn. Ibu's are 87 according to the menu and at 8.7 it is no slouch. It was very balanced with a tinge of aggressiveness."
"Not quite sure what happened here, as I really enjoyed this more in the bottle. Much more heat came out here on draft, which really inhibited the body and drinkibility for me. I'm still glad to have given it a shot, as Deschutes on tap is a rare find in my world."
"The mouthfeel of the body is decent, but the chalky finish knocks this down, as well as drinkability."
"D: I think this beer is right down the middle of the road as far as drinkability goes. Not as drinkable as less hoppy brews, but more drinkable than a lot of IPA's & DIPA's that I've had."
"D: The great presence of malts make me think of barleywine rather than DIPA. This is definitely a sipper, and a darn good one. Deschutes, you never cease to amaze me."
"beer, a first experience you'll always remember."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable for the alcohol level, and the bitterness level. I paired the second half with a bourbon white cheddar, and the pairing was sploogetastic. I'm not sure if this is better than batch #2 or not, but it's damn good. That's for sure. Show me a better 22oz DIPA for the price. I dare you!"
"M/D - Medium bodied with a sharp, mouth dominanting bitterness. The bitterness stays with you. Alcohol is strong enough to knock the drinkability down a notch."
"Color is amber with a small white head. Decent Belgian lacing. Aroma was mostly citrus with some herbal notes. Well balanced with a toasted malt background. Overall though I thought it was closer to an IPA than a double IPA. Seemed to be lacking the big malt and hop character of a double IPA."
"Drinkability is excellent. I would love to try this one on tap. I could get really wasted on this beer if I didn't know its strength. A really nice blend of hops and drinkability."
"Thanks Toby!!!"
"D: Would recommend this to anyone that has a taste for hops. 95 IBUs, and seems so complex that I am lost. The smells tells me that there is an amazing door, somewhere in this flavor maze, but my tongue can't read a map, so I will have to wait until he finishes his hooked-on-phonics. My apologies to Deschutes, and all others for not being as in depth as I like to be with my reviews, I think that my sinus infection might have hindered me way too much on this one. Or I'm just making excuses for being a neophyte. Highly recommend, and am very thankful that I got to try it."
"D: Good taste, remarkable balance. Uni-bomber at best (one and done...at least for tonight)"
"Another great brew from Deschutes Brewery. Poured a dark orange color with a thin white head, and plenty of lacing on the glass. Highly citrus and slightly floral aroma. Rich, largely citrus and slightly herbal flavor with decent amount of malt to balance all the hop goodness. Do I detect a note of mint in there. Really smooth, drinkable brew."
"Overall: This beer is not as """experimental""" as the label would suggest. This is a good thing, though. Hop Henge is an extremely solid IPA. In fact, it's perhaps one of the best I've had; my score is definitely proof of that. It just does about everything right. This one was also an especially nice treat because it was driven back from Denver for me. I will definitely be on the lookout for more Deschutes beers in the future. A replacement for this is also going on my wish list."
"Certainly glad I tried it. I won't be getting this again as there are better, but as I said before, I'd highly recommend this to someone looking for a well-balanced DIPA."
"IPA fans will probably enjoy this one, although there are better brews of that style around."
"Pours a golden orange with large off-white head and some good lacing. Hop aroma is lacking big time. What is there is citrus and pine. A bready/toasty character malt aroma. Flavor displays a bit more hop character than the nose, but still not outstanding. Orange and pine. Bitterness is through the roof. Almost harsh. Some caramel notes and sweet. Alcoholic/warming. Medium-full in body. Bitterness is a bit out of hand, and the hop aroma/flavor are holding this back from being a great IIPA."
"The 8.75% is pretty well masked but the bomber was enough for me in this particular setting. I wasn't craving another one after."
"One bomber will be plenty for me tonight. Tasty beer, but in my opinion not the brewery's best effort."
"In regards to mouthfeel the beer is very effervescent. It has a nice amount of carbonation and it tickles the tongue. It is a little heavier than medium bodied but is certainly easy to drink because of how tasty it is. I recommend it."
"Overall a great brew. One of the top IPA's. I'm gunna buy it whenever I can get some fresh ones."
"D: Drinkable for a DIPA, but it gets a bit alcoholic after awhile."
"Drinkability is effortless from the moment you sample the first few sips to the second your swirling the last dregs from the bottle, you simply want more. Thanks for the sample, I know 22 ounces should be enough for anybody. In this case a bomber just induces cravings much like the Nugget Nectar that made me purchase back to back cases, this would be my go to hop fix if readily available."
"this is a good beer very smooth and very drinkable. It is also very aesthetic. It has a beautiful color nice lacing and good head retention. The taste is very nice with a good hop bitterness. I expected more of a big hop aroma than this bottle produced"
"Well, this was a great brew all the way around... It put me on my keister quick too... Highly recommended!"
"NOTE: This was a bottle of Batch #2."
"Drinkability is fine even with the fairly high ABV. More than 1 of these bombers is, likely, too much for me. Plus the bitterness deadens the palate pretty quickly so I don't see any reason to have more than 2 glasses, 1 glass would provide the maximum enjoyment."
"D - Would have more than one..."
"The taste is aggressively and un-remorsefully bitter, with sticky, resinous hops laying a hurt to nearly every part of the palate--front of the tongue, roof of the mouth, back of the throat. It's a literal hop explosion, but I could use a bit more balance from the malts and/or flavor complexity to the hoppiness, as the bitterness nearly wipes out the taste buds after half a glass. Still, it's one helluva ride! Body is big and chewy, with a moderate carbonation level that adds some pep to the long lingering of bitter hop resins. All in all, a solid IIPA from Deschutes, but I think I like their more restrained Inversion IPA better."
"Nice value for the $4.99 I paid. Will have again."
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op (the only one, oddly...perhaps it was just the last of their first round of shelving). Pours a rich red amber with a beautiful creamy head that laces like a thin white fleece and sticks all over the glass. Aroma is clean with lots of floral citrus hops...i get mostly grapefruit with some tangerine/peach in there too. Flavor is a right-on balance of malt body with tangerine and grapefruit and a strong, but not overwhelming, bitterness. Bitterness lingers in a satisfying manner. Creamy mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Drinks very well, a nice, extremely well crafted treat."
"Beer pours a mahogany with a nice white head. Smell is very piney, with some really nice floral and some citrus (grapefruit). Some sweet malt. Taste is really intense. Really attacks the taste buds. Quite a lot of malt to balance out the hops and give the beer a bit more sweetness than ideal. The aftertaste if very bitter and fairly intense. The nearly 9 % abv is very evident. Definitely one to try. For me, the nose really stands out, but not necessarily the beer itself. Good, but not in the upper echelon of the style."
"Great looking beer. Reddish amber with a chunky off white head. Complex aroma-- ripe citrus and herbal notes with some toasty malt in the background. Initially has a little bite of pungent, bitter hops. Recognizable Deschutes malt bill comes through mid-palate, with toasty/spicy flavors and vague hints of fruitiness, almost woody-- similar to the Inversion. Hops are bitter throughout, mostly a white grapefruit pith bitterness that lingers well beyond the clean, dry finish. Sort of an old school hoppiness: rough, bracingly bitter and completely lacking the trendy tropical fruit juiciness that is showing up in so many IPAs lately. Not a quaffer; this is a good one to sip and ponder, as it is tough to nail down and it improves as it warms. This is well done, complex, and hits the spot for a hearty double IPA."
"I am editing my review to include some on-tap Hop Henge I recently had. The draft version semed to be more copper-colored my review indicates. The floral hop notes were more up-front in both the aroma and flavor. I found the draft to very smooth and drinkable for an ImpIPA. An excellent beer."
"Overall impression: Not my favorite DIPA. A little thin and watery without a lot of the character I've come to expect from really good DIPAs. I probably held onto this one for too long."
"D - Not bad, but would like to see something with more oomph."
"Batch #2. Poured with vigor into a tulip glass. Hop Henge is orange/amber in color and pours out with a two-finger head which readily dissipates, leaving behind just a wisp of foam and spotty, sticky lacing. Smell is of candied citrus hops: the caramel malt backbone adds the sweetness to the tangerine-like, slightly piney hop profile. One whiff reminds me of juicy fruit gum. This a seriously hoppy brew, as the taste betrays. There is a significant malty backbone, however Hop Henge is all about citrusy, spicy hops with a dash of pine. It's damn tasty, and the tangy finish lingers for quite some time. Mouthfeel is near perfect IMO, medium thick with an oily, resiny texture wrapped around lively carbonation. At this point - not quite halfway through the bomber - i'm also finding highly drinkable and hard to put down."
"The nose is great on this one and the rest of it is very good. Another very good IPA from the west coast."
"Batch #1 pours a nice amber/copper color with a thin head and minimal lacing. Smells super fruity with heavy citrus notes and an overall sweet finish. Has an initial sweet, syrupy taste that ends in a bitter, tongue snapping way. Very well balanced for the amount of hops that in this brew. While high in alcohol, definitely not overbearing while still maintaining a strong malty character. A memorable ale from an amazing brewery. Way excited to try batch #2 for any discrepancies/surprises."
"Poured a medium and very slightly hazy amber color with a larger sized off white head. Some lacing was left on the glass as the head diminished. Aromas of fruitiness, citrus, floral, caramel, and pine. Tastes of pine, citrus, lighter fruitiness (vs. the aromas), floral, and caramel. The floralness came out more and more as I drank and enjoyed this one. I was pleasantly surprised by this one."
"D - Very tasty and you can't taste the alcohol. Could be disastrous."
"This is a fantastic beer and a must for all of those hopheads who cannot gain access to Deschutes. For Oregonians - appreciate, love, and cherish this beer; it's special."
"I'm drinking it now and it's 8.75%...this review might be a little impaired. Never-the-less, this is a very good IPA...caramely and bitter -- best of both worlds. More bitter than caramel. Medium to dark in color. Nice sticky foam head. Somewhat like Deschutes Inversion IPA but with more caramel in my opinion. This comes only in 20oz bottles. No six packs. Good stuff."
"I found this better than the previous version of Hop Henge. It is at a good price point ($4.99), but for my money I would probably go with something from a different West Coast brewer."
"D- Very pleasant, a lovely all around beer."
"All in all, a great beer. If Deschutes is available in your state, get the Hop Henge. I think it might even be better than the Abyss."
"Nice IPA from Deschutes. Well balanced with a tasty hop structure. Pours a medium brown with a tan head. The nose has a flowery bouquet of hops over sweet malts. Taste is on the English IPA side as it strays from the huge hop hit. Medium body well carbonated."
"Pours clear amber with a one finger off white head. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma is floral, piney hops. Taste is piney grapefruit orange bitter hops with a firm malt component. Mouthfeel is good with perfect carbonation. Some alcohol is evident and also the effect of same. Drinkability is good if you don't mind the 8.75%abv."
"D - Mostly enjoyable and mostly easy to drink"
"Flavor is hugely piney with some herbal notes and an undercurrent of unsweet citrus. Malt profile is very subdued, with maybe a little caramel malt sweetness but not much. Bitterness is between medium and high, and there's some slightly metallic astringency. Definitely a hophead's IPA. Could use more bitterness and maybe a bit more complexity. Mouthfeel is dry with nice carbonation and medium body. Pretty good."
" What can I say?....I'm not really hoppy with it. Someone will have to buy the next one for me or maybe I'll drink it again if I find it on tap."
"D- Easy to drink, the hop bite isn't too over powering."
"Hops up front on the tongue, followed by a moderate maltiness. Notes of citrus on the nose and tongue lessen through the beer, becoming more pine and earthy. Lighter in malt body than I expected given the ABV, not overly sweet or cloying by any means. ABV is cloaked well nonetheless. Does deliver a bitter and chalky close as a result of the relative dryness that lingers on the throat after the swallow. Feel is good as the finish is more to my liking than a sweet viscous close for a DIPA. Bitterness does limit the drinkability a bit however. Drinks lighter than its weight, that's for sure."
"A little more time eating the sugars, and sh!tt!n' out the burn.. this would be a barley wine. A tad sweet for my taste. Between this, and a ruination.. I'd go w/ the ruination. Imagine hop trip set out in the sun like a sun-tea... after a few kegs settled down to a jar... you've got this. It is great!"
"The only real problem I can find with this beer is that at 8.75% ABV I can't drink as much of it as I want to. Bottom line: if you see this, buy it and enjoy one of the best of the best."
"Spot on for the style, what ever they tweaked it still stands comparable to the previous version. Love the beer ... make it year round please."
"Very nice job on the hops in this one, a pleasure to drink and then some."
"Once this brew hits the tongue, it's all over but the spielin'. The pounds of Centennial and Cascade hops are perfectly balanced to make this one of the smoothest-drinking hop bombs I've yet tried. Now, where's my Oregon map?"
"Overall impression: Great stuff from Deschutes here. Incredible DIPA."
"Very very good.. I would love to find out the story on the changes."
"Other comments: Interesting. This is definitely a """monument to hops""" in so much as it's loaded down with them. There's also a strange background flavor that I cannot describe, but it's not necessarily a good flavor. I wonder how this beer would do with 6-12 months on it."
"Drinkability is incredibly high for the style. I could easily have a few of these. I'm not feeling overwhelmed with hops, despite the 95 IBUs. Deliciously incredible. A truly beautiful orchestration of hops. I feel an addiction coming on."
"I'm torn with this beer. I want to like it fresh because the aroma is great and the hops are huge but it almost seems to need a few weeks to mellow out."
"I am a UK native living in the USA. We English invent things but some other country always picks up the ball and runs with it, god bless Bend Oregan USA :)"
"D: I can hit this sucker all night. Another great brew from Deschutes! Good things from this brewery and an all around solid drinker, a good hoppy showing"
"Very good brew to share with a freind."
"Sweetness there from the malt needed to bring up the abv, but it grasps on to hold the balance together. THis one is for the true hophead, anyone else will shudder in bitter bitter agony. Finish on this one is kind of smokey, which is interesting."
"Rather easy drinking for a DIPA."
"Sample at Tenaya Creek in Las Vegas. The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a wispy white head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Earthy malt, fruit and hops in the nose. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with fresh fruity hops, malt and caramel flavors. The finish is hoppy with lingering citrus and earthy malt aftertaste. Above average overall."
"This is a well balanced and intensely hoppy beer that relies on it's flavorful balance of hops and malts instead of trying to wow you with IBU's, thickness, or alcohol content- simply well done in recipe formulation and brewing execution!"
"Amber colored with a white head that had decent retention. Some sulfur in the aroma and floral; hops were a bit catty. Watery, but sweet malt eventually comes in, as well as sap, lemon, and some grainy flavors. Medium body and medium carbonation. Fairly drinkable, though I don't think I'd order another."
"Massive IIPA. Pours orange-gold with a pillowy whyite head and thick lacing. Fresh, floral hops with a lot of mango and pineapple. Somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Hop-bomb of pineapple, grapefruit, more mango, and resin. Definite biscuit back with more sugar flavor than caramel. Loved it."
"Sticky, and alcoholic, so can drink the bomber easily."
"Fairly big body with a spicy end. I prefer my IPA's to be more in the California style, but this is a nice break that seems to fit into the (fall) season a bit more. Thanks, Toby."
"Have not had this beer in some time and have to wonder if Deschutes has tweaked the recipe. Granted I've only had it out of the bottle prior to this, but I do not recall this beer previously tasting this good. The current version is exceptional."
"I bought a bottle for ~$4.50 at Lee's in Vegas. This beer was clear and colored copper like a used penny. The smell is strong with loads of malt along with the hops, making this more of an American barleywine than a DIPA. Tastes a lot like Bigfoot, very very hoppy but thickly sweet with malts. It was OK but honestly I prefer DIPA's that have less of a malt presence than this."
"Overall its a good Imperial IPA. Not the best i've had but it is a nice change from the citrus dominated IPA's."
"Check out http://beeradvocate.com/cookbook/recipe/8"
"D: Extremely easy drinking DIPA. I would recommend this for someone who is not a huge fan of the style or new to it. I love trying this style of beer and all the unique approaches. This is one that I will continue to pick up in the future and it couples nicely with Sleep's sixty plus minute magnum opus."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, there are better 2IPA's out there but this is still a good hop bomb to drink for a long time."
"Deschutes is a really great brewery and anything I've ever had from their 'Bond Street Series' has been especially good. 650ml is a nice sized portion for a beer like this. The Hop Henge DIPA isn't anything that'll throw your head back, but it certainly will satisfy your taste buds."
"Overall this is a solid beer, very representative of the style. One of the better ones from this solid brewery! 4.5."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and I will say it paired well with a peppered bacon & swiss grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread at 12:35am!!!"
"I got this beer on a special trip to Denver since I can't get it at home. So that being said, I will probably not pick up another when I am up next time, but yet I am intriqued to try this on draft at the brewery! We'll see...a nice effort nonetheless!"
"D- drinks like a friend's decent home brew."
"Although I really don't like sweet DIPA's this one just goes down pretty easy. The extra sweetness combines with the fairly soft hoppiness enough to make it mesh pretty well together. Only Deschutes could do that."
"Pours a clean amber with a very lively head. The aroma has a slight bitter soapiness to it that put me off at first, but it comes together as it warms, with a delicate malt and a slight whiff of floral hops. The flavor is amazing - floral, well balanced, delicate. It has hints of apricot. There is a small bite of alcohol, but nothing offensive. The hop character suggests a full, ripe flower. The mouth feel is clingy, leaving a beautiful, delicate bitterness on the finish. If you want a hop bomb, this is not your beer. If you want a subtle, balanced, floral double IPA, like a fine strong cup of expensive tea, this is for you."
"Pours a fairly clear light honey colored amber with a stiff inch deep off white head that resists fading in the 'perfect pint'. Light amount of lacing observed. The smell is nice orange and grassy hoppy with a balanced sweet malty character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth has a tangy hop feel. Medium bodied, the sweet malty piece lingers nicely. Full flavored, there is a fruity orange tangerine grassy taste that indicates tons of quality ingredients went into this product. A real nice drinker...the 8.75% ABV is well integrated. Really glad to have the opportunity to consider this one! A great 20th anniversary effort from Deschutes."
"D- It's a solid DIPA with a lot of orange and grass notes to it just nothing really to separate it from the crowd."
"Interestingly some of the posters have stated this to be a DIPA, and it's labeled as an Imperial IPA. Imop it's every bit of an Imperial and then some. A good find and being a hophead I truly recommend this one you will not be disappointed. This was a really enjoyable drink very cold, still enjoyable as it came to room temp. Enjoy!"
"The mouthfeel is between moderate and full with a sweet finish. Not under attenuated just sweet. Overall would have liked to see more hops in the nose and finish, but you can't win them all."
"Pours a crisp copper with a nice frothy off-white head. Aroma is a plethora of citrus hops with a hint of pine, slight caramel malts linger in the back. The taste is a nice amount of citrus with the malt right behind providing a decent balance. The beer is medium bodied with some sticky alcohol. This is an enjoyable IIPA, but there are better ones that I can get in my area."
"Prosit, MK"
"Overall, I'd recommend it, but for those die hard tear your heart out hops lovers, this one will fall slightly short. For those like me who enjoy hops enough, but not enough to sacrifice the heart, a very good dIPA."
"Pours a nice red/orange color with a fluffy head, but still diminished fairly quickly. nose is pure cascade and malts. Taste is similar, Cascade to the max and a nice malt presence. A very smooth brew here, but it really doesnt excite me all that much. A good beer, and one I would certainly drink if offered, but I can think of numerous DIPAs I would rather purchase. However, if you are a big cascade lover, this is probably the one for you. Mouthfeel is nice and viscous, could be slightly thinner I think. Drinkability is excellent, very smooth. Another solid beer from deschuttes, but nothing really mindblowing. A staple like DIPA, that I would probably purchase every so often if it was regularly available. Sweet label art. Good beer. Give it a try."
"D- great flavor and amazing balance, complex, recommended, best when fresh"
"Many thanks go out to PIMPP for the opportunity to try this one!"
"D: I would buy this one again. I would like to try some more from Deschutes."
"Another very solid brew from Deschutes. If you like bitter and hoppy IPAs, give it a shot."
"d: Not what I expected. Hop Henge is quite a beer. An excellent flavor, quite unlike other DIPAs. Love the strawberry notes. Another great brew from Deschutes."
"Pretty good drinkability, and a real pleasure to share with a friend."
"Pours a dark copper in color. Slight hoppy smell in the nose. This has a huge malt backbone to support the hops. Quite possibly the maltiest IIPA that I've had. Very bready and bittering in the flavor. Decent, but I prefer more Citrusy and juicy flavors."
"Good, but not great. Cool looking bottle and name."
"served from a bomber, this is on the darker side for the style-a brownish, hazy copper with a just off-white head and good lacing. aromas of caramel, toffee, grapefruit, nuts, pine, and resin come on strong. taste is a moderate malt sweetness appropriately overpowered by the significant hop bitterness. nicely carbonated, creamy and prickly, almost full-bodied. long finish, althought the hop bitterness is a bit rough."
"this one is big on hops, and a real nice ipa, it pours a slightley orange color with minimal head, this ine is not to thick or cloudy, this is a great repersintation of how an ipa should be, i espechaly like the aftertaste that stickes with you for awile, i wish that i had more than one of theese. if you can find this, buy it."
"22oz bottle. Pours an orangish amber with a nice white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet malt with a touch of caramel, citrusy hops and some alcohol is present in the nose as well. The taste is malt and a good dose of citrusy hops. A lot of grapefruit in the nose and taste. Overall, Hop henge Imperial IPA is a pretty good DIPA and another solid brew from Deschutes, I don't think they can make a bad beer. Hell, I don't think they can make an average beer if they wanted, outstanding brewery."
"I actually like this one a fair amount. The alcohol burn is a tad strong, but that's the only thing I really don't care for."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a copper to amber with a moderate white head and light lacing. Nose is mostly of citrus and floral hops. Mouthfeel is fizzy and the flavor is caramel malts and citrus hops. Alcohol burn kind of present in the finish. Decent IIPA."
"The beer is silky smooth with not too much carbonation. Hop Henge reminds me a lot of the SN Harvest Ales as far as mouthfeel and hop profile, thats some good company. I can drink this for hours. Beautiful beer. Highly recommended."
"D-There are to many IPS's out there for me to grab this one on my own but i wouldn't turn one down and would love to try it on tap."
"Drinkability - I'm kind of undecided on this one. I was expecting a hop explosion of some sort, and instead I've been greeted with other flavors, none of which are bad. I'm not sure if this is my idea of an Imperial/Double IPA, but I have to say I am enjoying it a lot."
"Drinkability is pretty good. A nice DIPA and very enjoyable."
"Chewy piney flavor on the first take. Hop bitterness slowly entering every corner of my mouth. I get a chewy, chalky hop resin flavor that I often get with Sierra beers, and I like it! Hop flavor, bitterness and alcohol sing together wonderfully. Super solid DIPA."
"Pours a clear amber with 3 fingers of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves nice sticky lacing. Smells of caramel, citrus, biscuits, and pine. Tastes of caramel and biscuit up front followed by citrus fruits like lemon, tangerine, orange, and grapefruit. Finishes with a touch of pine and a slight hint of the alcohol. Medium to medium full in body with a nice oiliness and well balanced between sweet malts and citrus. An excellent balanced IIPA that isn't too high in abv but packs in the flavors."
"Thanks again, Bill! And thanks to skourtis for sending two more bottles to me in '09!"
"This is a very drinkable double IPA, with a smooth (not harsh) bitterness."
"Poured from 22 oz. bottle to a sam perfect pint. Pours nicely with a huge fluffy white head which leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Nice orange color associated with west coast IPA's. Aromas of piney hops, but also of some sweetness- maybe a caramel type malt in the backround. Smell is not over the top hops, like I would think for a imperial IPA. Taste is similar- I get the hop bitter blast up front, but then it smoothes rather nicely, then leaves the bitter aftertaste on the sides of the tongue. Good version of a DIPA. Pretty drinkable as well. Somewhat thick for a hot night, though."
"d: Thanks to JohnGalt1 for this treat. This was good, but sweeter than I like my IPAs."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs Pharmacy, Imperial Beach CA"
"Overall great beer, I really really enjoy Desschutes brews, quickly becoming one of my favorites."
"Hop Henge is a pretty good DIPA, but I can't help but feel it's a little disappointing. It's hoppy and bitter, but not enough for my taste. I'd almost characterize this as an English DIPA if such a thing were to exist. It's just a little too malty in character and lacks the bruising hop punch it needs. It's still pretty good and definitely worth checking out. But, it's not quite an elite DIPA."
"Always willing to try a new Deschutes beer, especially an IPA, this was part of the same Bond Street Series as Hop Trip so I had pretty high expectations and they were met for the most part, did not have to go through much trouble to purchase it this time either, will drink again especially for its low price, recommended"
"Just a pleasant, all-round brew. Nothing to memorable about it, but I'd revisit it (particularly at that price-point)."
"This one is a monster at 8.75% but you would never know it, very, very well hidden. this one would be one easy to get in trouble with as it goes down fast, smooth, and all too easy, and at 4.99 a bomber a good value as well."
"The mouthfeel is thick and massaging. Carbonation on the lower side. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that i will be purchasing more of. An IIPA with individual character."
"D: An interesting beer from Deschutes, love the label. Wasn't blown away, just a good Double IPA for me."
"D- Pretty easy drinking but for the very bitter finish"
"Thanks Patrick!!"
"Wow, first sip is like a giant wave of juicy hop goodness. As immense as the first sip is, the finish is suprisingly smooth, with while not exactly low levels of bitterness, a level that is balanced and smooth unlike many over the top hop bombs. This is a major plus in my book, as I never got the point of making a beer so bitter you can't even enjoy all the hops in it after the first three sips. Some candy like sweetness present, slight warming from the ABV, clean finish, juicy aroma from start to finish. Just tasty tasty stuff. Missed out at a brewfest, and glad I picked up half a case."
"Overall, extremely drinkable. A very balanced beer. Not quite as much hops as I would expect for an imperial IPA, but a very good beer nonetheless"
"Thus, I would say the mouthfeel is just about right, medium for style, with carbonation definitely on the lower side of average. The finish showcases the hops nicely, and there's a concomitant bump in the score. Alcohol is only mildly noted, especially when chilled. Nicely hidden, and a good brew overall. Would have liked to have tried l'Henge originale, as it's been highly touted to me personally as well as on the internets. Que c'era, as they say. This one should satisfy the hop head set."
"Highly recommend this beer for the hop heads out there, it should spark a lively debate about it's taste"
"I really appreciate Deschutes beers and this is no exception. The deeper I dive into this one the more I like the uniqueness. Hop Henge is brewed with Centennial, Cascade, and a yet to be named variety that I'm guessing adds the spiciness. Hopefully this unnamed hop gets used in other brews along the way because it's out of the ordinary and I'd like to get to know it a little better."
"Drinkability is moderate, the alcohol presence is mixed into the front of the taste and is mostly gone in the finish, a very bitter DIPA with low hop taste profile, nice malt balance, wished this had a bit more body and texture, okay but nothing great for this style"
"D: The only way the alcohol shows is in your BAC"
"Overall this is I beer I really enjoy, and have gone back to a couple times. It is way too easy drinking for it's strength as I could down several in a row. It is just complex enough to keep you yearning for more, and at around 4 bucks a bomber it's deal."
"D: This beer is just way too freaking sweet. It overwhelms the palate and dominates the other flavors. Not my favorite DIPA by a long shot."
"D - Outstanding. I was done after two glasses, but I was craving more. Came back to have another a few days later, and the keg had blown. The bartender said it was their second one and were not likely to get another, what a shame. If you find this baby, don't hesitate."
"a very smooth IPA with a finish that lingers long after the sip, but the beer is never too aggressive or upfront."
"Pours a deep orange copper color, with a bit of a white head that leaves a small amount of lacing. Smells of citrus, and tastes of grapefruit and orange with a mild bitter aspirin aftertaste. There's a lot of citrus tingle on the palette. Not the most intense DIPA I've had; in fact, it's on the mild side for a DIPA. More like a good solid IPA. At any rate, while it's not the most powerful DIPA I've had, it's a solid entry from Deschutes and very drinkable. Too bad they don't make this one all year, as Inversion is not that big of a deal."
"D: Very drinkable for an IIPA. I would consider it a heavier IPA, but it's a stretch to call it a double."
"D: Very drinkable. Tastes like it is around 6%."
"D: Very odd but still tasty. The more controlled alcohol in the taste helps drinkability. I probably won't seek this out again but that's because it's terrible.. there are just so many equally good, and even more better DIPAs that are much easier to find. Thanks for the opportunity to try this brew, Sam."
"Drinks a little slow, due to the complexity of this ale. The taste draws you in, I believe this beer would sneak up & whoop your ass if you choose to session on this! Super DIPA IMO, won't get hyped too widely available, more for me!"
"Solid 4's for me, a good beer but nothing really stood out as """great.""" Pours a nice copper color with thick rocky head, good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is a blast of hops, very nice fresh hops. I personally didnt really notice too much of a citrus smell, just good ol bitter hops. Taste is on par with smell. It wasnt as bitter as I expected (or maybe I'm just getting used to IPA's). Dominating hops, a touch of sweetness too it, but a very small touch. Bitter, somewhat oily feeling left on the back of the tounge. Moderately carbonated which seemed perfect, somewhat full bodied."
"Drink ability: This a great summer beer. Easy drinking. I'm having to no problems with polishing of the bottle. I would definitely recommend this beer. I look forward to heading down to Bitter Creek and having a draft. I am big Dechutes fan and Hop Henge is no exception."
"Nice one. Maintains a bitter hop edge, but cool, calm, & collected. Delicious."
"Overall: Another great brew by Deschutes. One of the best DIPA's I have had in quite sometime, and by far one of the most drinkable."
"Drinkablity: Very enjoyable and drinkable brew. Plenty of hop power."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This bottle has been in the cellar for almost a year and a little bit of time has been very good to it. It pours a deep amber, smells of ruby grapefuit and flowers. The taste is mellow and comforting. For 8.1% ABV this IPA is pretty soft on the palette. Mouthfeel is full and drinkability is (in my opinion) far greater than many imp. IPA's. I love this beer. Another fine limited release from Deschutes."
"Pours a dark copper hue with a nice two finger fluffy white head that qucikly dies down to a thin layer leaving a very impressive lacing. Let's just say I can smell this one from across the room. Powerful creamy hops of mostly pine mixed well with a very noticable caramel malt that created a very unique DIPA scent. Taste is a very earthy hop flavor of dirt, woody pine, and grass. A tiny bit of alcohol on the tongue towards the end, but doesn't over-power at all. Aftertaste is a bit dry, but a nice mild citrus hop flavor with a creamy malt balance. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and thick with a great combination of just enough carbonation. Pretty solid DIPA, definitely can't complain. Good one to enjoy for sure."
"A very good beer, which seemed to show off the hops more as it warmed. My general experience has been that malt is what usually comes forward with increasing temperature, so this was a nice surprise. Not a """top shelf""" DIPA for me (like 'em a little less sweet), but one I would certainly drink again."
"Amber in color with a decent white head that laces my pint glass and leaves that lovely sticky film. Aroma is hoppy but not at all piney or grassy. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer in that this doesn't quite fit the bill of """West Coast IPA""". Sure, it is hoppy (with a nice fruity flavor) but there is no citrus or pine flavor that always jumps out of the San Diego IPA's. This is closer to an Inversion style IPA. Either way, this is an excellent value for $3.50 per bottle."
"Update: Newer batches of this beer are pretty good. Bumping score from 3.3 to 4.0."
"Highly drinkable double IPA. Almost too drinkable. Glad I'm at home with only one bottle to finsh, if I was at the brewery, I'd be in trouble."
"D: The abv is not conducive to pounding, but I think that some age on this beer would serve well, mellowing out the hops a bit for added balance."
"Had a nice lookin pour, amber orange with a small but commanding lace generator. Plenty of citrusy orange to go around, and a bit of woody vine to balance it out. Fine hop bomb, glad to have had the chance to try it."
"Grab one and stretch it out to get the most from the evolving flavors."
"Recommended, but don't expect a hop mutilation, expect a friendly malt and hops get-together. Cheers!"
"I'm sorry that I never got a chance to try the original Hop Henge IPA because I've heard so many good things about it. This Imperial version is pretty good in its own right, but can't quite get over the hump to join my favorites of the style. Hopheads shouldn't hesitate to buy a bomber. Non-hopheads might want to spend their money elsewhere."
"Drinkability- Really impressed with this one. A nice change to have a DIPA with a bit of malt attitude. Well balanced with a best of both worlds. Excellent as usual from Deschutes."
". Excellent flavor, though, with very high bitterness, a lot of citrusy hop flavor, sticky sweet malt, and a nice fruitiness at the close, along with a lignering dryness. Alcohol is detectable but does not detract. Big bodied--I assume it's all-malt"
"Overall: A bit of a malt backbone than I prefer in my IPAs, but the balance is nice"
"D - While this DIPA comes through in a big way on a kind of lopsided balance, its hop flavor is not as fruity and flowery as I generally prefer. I would still recommend that you give it a try, but I doubt it will be among your favorite DIPAs."
"D: I was craving a good hoppy beer and this satisfied for sure. Hopheads will most likely dig this beer. Would get this again for sure."
"Appearance is a nice clear orange/amber color with a huge head that doesn't really stick around...moderate lacing. The is a smell of sweet brown sugar and a touch of spiciness. Thefirst flavor that smacks you is a super sweet malty molassas flavor, but is quickly smashed by an abundance of hoppy bittereness. There's a nice melding of sweet and bitter on the back end that gives way to a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and thickly sweet. Drinks mighty easy for a 95ibu 8% beer..."
"Very tasty beer. Definitely one I would drink again. This will probably not appeal to non-hopheads, however, whou would probably be better off with someting more mild. Me, I could drink this all night, but if I did the abv would kick my ass come the next day, so maybe it's not quite sessionable."
"Just enough bitterness from the hops to make you want another sip...then another."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, gritty, lip smacking of bitterness."
"Pours a light brownish/orange with a 1""" head. Highly carbonated with very small bubbles running throughout. Good lacing. A bit lighter color than normal for the style. Strong northwest hops and citrus in the nose. Palate hits strong of hops up front, but mild on the back end. Very subtle in the aftertaste. Very pleasing. Very light sugary sweetness rounds out the flavors. Medium-bodied, thanks to big malt presence. Very likeable as it permeates the mouth. Drinkability was low for some reason, not sure why considering how much i enjoyed the beer."
"Just when I'd started to lose interest in sharply flavored beers, Deschutes brings me back :)"
"It is served quite cold and with a thick yellow-tan and bubbly head. The color is light golden-brown with some reddish hints. The smell is good - complex floral and citrus hops. The taste was a little disappointing, though the higher alcohol content is very well masked. The taste was mainly just of bitter hops, with a strong bitter hops aftertaste. It's a good IPA, but a little heavy on the harder hops and not a ton of complexity."
"I'm now liking the flavours I'm getting with this brew. Big hoppy grapefruit along with some nice caramel malt and some fruitiness that are all tasting just fine...good balance too. Maybe my other sample wasn't up to snuff or my tastebuds that day were """damaged""" or what ever. This is a good, solid Impy IPA."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark orange color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white head, nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is hoppy, malty, citrusy, and some caramel. The taste is mostly hoppy, but the malts do come in the middle, the finish is dry, slightly malty and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice/tasty DIPA from Deschutes."
"Not real drinkable beer. The hop bitterness is overdone, and the alcohol makes it less than sessionable. It wouldn't be much of a thirst quencher either. I'll probably pass this one up if I see it again."
"Pours a beautiful deep gold color. Respectable head that settles into a sizeable amount of foam floating on top and clinging to the side of the glass. From the moment you begin pouring, the """ginormous""" amount of hops used in this brew produces an aroma that hopheads live for. Tastes very grassy and hoppy. The hops overwhelms any malt that might be in the beer. It tastes absolutely wonderful. Very very smooth and very drinkable. The hop bitterness hits the entire mouth and slowly evaporates to the back of the throat. The 8% abv is hardly noticeable at all.... A very highly recommended oregon beer...."
"22 oz bomber. This one pours a nice deep golden color with a small head that falls to a slight coat over top. This one is very clear with a few sparse bubbles working up. The aroma brings a dose of chunky caramel malt with an earthy hop under it. There is a mild citrusy sweetness and an apparent alcohol. The flavor is a little rough to me. It has a little solventy character from the combination of the alcohol and bitterness. The caramel comes through as a nice sweetness along with the citrusy hop. The bitterness clings on the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick with a very fine carbonation. Overall this one is okay. The flavor isn't as melded as I would like but it drinks well."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable, although I thought the hop profile would have been a bit bigger. A very spicy hop profile to this made me think it was a barleywine at time. Definitely a nice one if you can find it."
"A good release from Deschutes!"
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, the Hop Henge is bronze colored with a thick tan head, which rescinded to a small, lingering top coat that left a pretty, sticky lace. The aroma is really nice and bright, lot of cascade and piney NW hops, a little brown sugar, but also really stong fusel alcohol. The taste is not nearly so pleasant. Initially there's a nice sweet, bready malt flavor, but it's quickly overrun by exxxtreme bittering hops and omnipresent fusels. Whoa, thats harsh, the aftertaste feels like I just took a shot of rubbing alcohol. And at only 8.1% ABV, pretty amerteurish...maybe their ferm. temps ran away from them or something, what ever it was, I'm far from impressed. The mouthfeel is really pretty nice, creamy and not to thick, with a light carbonation that is easily roused. The drinkablilty was very low for me because I just didn't like it at all. It was so bitter and boozy though that it managed to numb my senses, and by the second half of the bomber I was able to pick up some steam, though I was really just to get it over with."
"Drinkability- Pretty tasty overall and would definitely drink again. Went quite well with the cheese pizza I was enjoying. Worth a try!"
"I was expecting this to be nigh-impossible to drink the whole thing -- but no, I quickly quaffed the entire bottle, and it was nice the whole way through, indeed, better as it warmed a bit. Get some if you can."
"D: Compared to most of the Imperial IPA offerings this beer is easy drinking. Lower ABV and refreshingly clean. Nothing over the top but a nice beer none the less."
"D -- Pretty good as far as huge Imperial IPA's go, WTF do you want? Damn the torpedoes, session any brew you want! *whimper*, but I'm a pansy so i can't session this brew *whine*"
"From the look and smell I knew this was a hop forwards beer. What else would you expect from an Imperial IPA? Mouth twitching excitement as soon as it hit. Hops and bitterness all the way through with citrus tinges and a few hints of honeysuckle and sunflower. It takes some time to enjoy and hides its 8.1% no where. The bottle rings this in with 95IBU's and you know it has it. It is a bundle of hops slammed into a bottle. Love it. One Night Stand of Long Term Relationship."
"D: After a few sips, my palate is already tired from this one. This one is drinkable, but it needs some work, or at least a long period in the cellar."
"Monster hops on the palate. Not for those who don't like ipa's """because they're too bitter.""" But there is a finishing sweetness trying to battle through. Perhaps the citrus esters. It leaves the mouth so happy! I'm off to yodle now! Cheers!"
"Thank you Deschutes...once again damn that's a tasty beer."
"Feel is nice, yet it isn't as crisp as it could be. I could probably finish the bomber, but the lack of a clean finish hinders this."
"Mouth is very nice. I rated the drinkability a 5 because this is a world class double IPA that brewers like Great Divide, Avery, Three Floyds or Oskar Blues would charge us at least $8 dollars for. If Deschutes keeps this up they'll be right there with Stone, producing the best beers possible for an insanely low price. Word up Deschutes."
"22 oz bomber. Clear amber beer, wth a great looking creamy/frothy light tan head, nice carbonation strings visible. Wow very hoppy aroma, more on the pine side of things, but certainlly spicy and fresh Nice bitterness, it is also semi-sweet malty undernesth. Loads of hops, and a touch of alcohol, though its pleasing rather than distracting.Long bitter after taste. Sweet and semi-dry finish, good on the palate. I liked this one, not quite as good as last years IPA version, but I did enjoy it. It wasnt too sweet which spoils an IIPA for me."
"Certainly a drinkable DIPA from Deschutes. The 8%abv seems like more but this beer has a nice malt/hop ratio in the flavor department that promotes easy drinking."
"Pours an orange-amber color topped by a half-inch of creamy off-white head that diminishes to near nothing pretty quickly. Nice aroma of sweet, fruity hops and a touch of grapefruit mixed in with a decent amount of sweet caramel malt. The hops really come through on the palate - right up front, huge, citrusy, assertively bitter hops that yield just a bit to some moderately sweet malt by mid-palate. Towards the swallow the hops take over again, with a bracing bitterness that yields a pleasant finish. Body is substantial enough to hold the flavor well, without being too sticky. A very drinkable IPA, especially for one in the 8+% ABV range."
"Drinkability: This beer is so easy to spend time with. I'm glad that I have more in the cellar to see how it changes over time. Highly recommended."
