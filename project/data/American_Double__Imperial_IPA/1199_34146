I’m amazed at how much I like it actually!  It has to be because this bottle has a year’s age on it, which must have really toned down the hops.  It actually tastes much more like an American barleywine rather than a double IPA.  It’s fucking delicious!","Jeffreysan","Jan 26, 2015"

4.12,-2.1,2.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,"Had this immediately after Founders Centennial IPA and it really is in a lot ways very similar, but in other ways very different. Instead of centennials bright reddish amber, double trouble is a more subtle hazy orangeish straw color with a subdued head. Smell is mild but good, sweet pineapple, mild hoppy punch, bready malts, hint of vanilla. Taste is much smoother and maltier than I was expecting very creamy. Ruby red grapefruit. Fresh bright hops finish it off. Feel is slick and creamy, I bet this would be amazing on nitro. Mild carbonation. Overall, I really enjoyed it. Very malty, delicious hops.","Samuel906","Jan 22, 2015"

A very in your face beer and one that had to be sipped away at slowly rather than quaffed, perhaps the only thing that prevented me from rating it that little bit higher.","flyingpig","Jan 19, 2015"

Likewise, beers aren't superior the stronger they are or the more loudly they're hopped.

Taste is sweet caramel malt followed by some citrus fruity notes, grapefruit and earthy hops. Palate is a medium to full body, smooth goes down easy, good carbonation. Finish is a combination of sweet bitter caramel malt, fruity and some lingering earthy grapefruit pungent, tangy hops. Alcohol seems well behaved.

A small, thin disk of head quickly dissipates into decent lace on the glass. The nose shows citrus and hops, and when I take a sip, that's the first thing that hits - immediately followed by a bitterness that I find unpleasant, and that clings to the tongue long after I swallowed and overshadows any other flavours that might have been present... I had high hopes for this one and was a bit disappointed in the taste. The alcohol is well-hidden, only becoming noticeable at the very end. The mouthfeel is of a nice, creamy brew with just enough carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer, but the bitterness turns me off of this one.","slym","Aug 08, 2014"

4.56,8.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"My aggro pour not only caused a pseudo-cascade which settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention, but it released a lot of esters. So much so that my eyes watered briefly and I even sneezed! In the interim, the head began to fall, leaving sticky acing in its wake. I would need a jackhammer later to remove all of it. Color was reminiscent of the old television show, Solid Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity! This, of course, brought forth the Unholy Trio of Mammon, Croesus and Midas, all clamoring for some of my gelt. I went for a deeper sniff instead and found the nose to be a combination of pine tar and caramel, but in a very nice way. Mouthfeel was dense and heavy, like a dollop on the tongue. It came with a boxer's one-two punch with the fusel alcohol heat softening up my poor, bruised tongue and then the intense pine hops hitting right behind. Holy ...! I was rendered at a loss for words for a moment and it caused me to wonder what kind of havoc its brother, Devil Dancer, might be like. Phew. 86 IBUs and 9.4% ABV, just the way I like to start every day. I know that fresher is better, especially when it comes to hops and this read "Bottled 06/17/2014" and I began to wonder what it might be like aged. Phew. Did I say that already? My eyes were watering, my nose was running and I was beginning to doubt my self-proclaimed hophead status. Finish hit like a belt to the solar plexus and if you have never had the pleasure, try this. It was literally breathtaking. Dry and hot and suddenly, the Zephyr winds could be heard blowing across the Sahara! OMFG. I had better stick to AIPAs in the future.","woodychandler","Aug 06, 2014"

4.37,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Overall: This is one of those IPAs (and beers in general) that has different aromas and flavors when cold than closer to room temperature. The toasted malt is more prominent when chilled, resulting in a more balanced beer per se, but as it warms, the citrus is where i like it to be with malts becoming sweeter and playing more in the background. My ratings are based on this beer being closer to room temperature which i enjoy more than straight out the fridge. However, this is not up there with my absolute favorites in the style, but close! Founders is my favorite brewery for a reason: They make great representations in any style! I highly recommend it for someone who enjoys a well balanced IPA. LET IT WARM UP!

The hop profile is nice but just gets strongly overpowered by the alcohol character which overpowers the malt which could provide a much nicer counterbalance.

The initial aroma is pure Cascade: deep and piney, but developing some malt depth as it warms and open up. The taste is equally big, with deep malts balance off of huge citrus and floral hops. It has nice solid weight to the body and is an excellent Imperial IPA.","delta490","Jul 25, 2014"

So I tasted the beer and was impressed by its tart and biter features. It was a perfect thing to drink after a long day at work.","Polycarp55","Jul 23, 2014"

The beer itself is a clear bright orange with a very light brown note. The beer smell has strong grapefruit and resin notes. The overall smell is also fairly crisp. The grapefruit notes dominate the nose but the resin seems to dull it a little bit and make it floral. Also, there seems to be a slight black peppery smell. The taste is fairly surprising and different from the smell. The grapefruit notes are much stronger in the taste than it is in the smell but there also appears to be a more citrus and floral flavors appearing with a tiny hint of sweetness but overshadowed by the hops. The taste also has a slight note of black pepper and the pine flavors are also there. The mouthfeel is crisp and surprisingly light for a Double IPA but still heavy bodied. Overall, a fantastic Double IPA and one worth getting if you can. This is definitely the easiest and most complex DIPA that I have had to date.","HattedClassic","Jul 22, 2014"

After being duped a few weeks ago with buying a bottle that was from 2013 and throwing my tastebuds for a twist, this redeemed that experience. Its a huge beer at 9.4%, but the tast is just out of this world. After that year old, I took a sip of this, and was expecting just a mouthful of bitter hops (which would have been fine!), but then there was the more complex aspect. There was something else in there to cut that biterness a little, but didnt take away from the double IPA flavor. There was a fruity aspect in it, after the initial bitter hop taste. Not fruity like a belgian IPA, but fruity like a cross between a peach and a grapefruit that had sex with a hop plant and brought forth a forbidden fruit - a fruit/hop hybrid that we have all grown to love.","plutoniumpete","Jul 11, 2014"

Beautiful aroma of citrus and grapefruit. Taste is of strong grapefruit and warm burn from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is peppery and a little carbonation as well.

From my reading this is not typical, so its possible I got a got a bum batch. It smells fantastic, and the aroma might be its best quality about it. Very citrusy; lots of grapefruit and not overly piney. The taste is sharp and seems to try to do too much. The citrus holds throughout, but the beer seems very malty, almost like homebrew extract. Not nearly as smooth as many other IIPAs. Overall, this beer is overrated. I am a big Founders fan, but this beer underdelivers.

4.39,4.3,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"An excellent example of a great DIPA. The appearance was dark yellow with a thin head. The nose was bursting with floral and pine from the hops, although there was a bit of sweetness on the back end from the roasted malt. The flavor was amazing with full force of hops coming in the beginning while leaving the sweetness from the malt in the finish to make a very refreshing beer that doesn't attack your senses. Overall I thought it was an amazing beer.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 30, 2014"

Generally, "balanced" is a throwaway term when it comes to beer, but this one manages to maintain a strong, fresh hop flavor without sacrificing a clean, lemony-crisp smoothness. About as close to perfect as it can get. Very reasonably priced, but tough to find in the northeast.","bleggs","Oct 19, 2013"

The aroma was full of tropical fruits, floral hops and citrusy grapefruit notes. The initial taste was a huge grapefruit rind bitterness that deftly slid into a lingering floral hop bitterness and dry finish. The bready malt backbone helped hide alcohol that was undetectable. As the beer warmed the flavors became more intense and well balanced taking you through it’s robust hop flavor profile with every sip. A troublingly tasty and tippable brew despite it’s high ABV and bold hop flavors.","brurevu","Aug 21, 2013"

With a few months in the bottle, they have calmed down and started to come into their own. Very complex and enjoyable even to a novice just getting into beer.

Unlike many DIPAs that are big on hop flavor, this one also packs a helluva bitterness punch. Malts are pretty non-existent on actual flavor, but it does have a very smooth and creamy body...typical of Founders with a very fine-bubbled carbonation. I like it well enough, but there are a couple local DIPAs that I am surprised to say I would probably buy over this, freshness being equal of course. I like that it is available in 4-packs though as opposed to the bomber format.","twiggamortis420","May 28, 2013"

Feel and body are appropriate for the style. This is my third of the night and it's just as good as the first. Pretty easy drinking for the strength and flavor profile. Not overly hoppy but just not what I expected. A pretty standard, boozy DIPA that doesn't leave me craving more. Still a great beer, nonetheless.","Gatch","May 18, 2013"

Nice mouth feel, good amount of carbonation. Dry, but not overly dry. Overall, a really incredible beer. As long as it is available it will be my go to beer. I also like that its available in 12 oz 4 packs as opposed to the 22 bombers. Better price and it make is easier to drink on a random weeknight.","msween21","May 16, 2013"

Hopslam is extremely sweet (but not in a way that's cloying), and this is rather dry and bitter -- it's all about your personal preference.

I can't say this beer is very pretty but it certainty is not ugly. The first smell is pine with citrus and grapefruit and hints of mango. This IPA is more on the piny side but there is a nice complexity to keep it from being one dimensional. The taste is earthy, sweet, piny, and fruity. One of the more complex tasting DIPAs I've had recently. I think a lot of DIPAs try to be hop bombs and pallet strippers rather then assertive and complex. The mouthfeel is a little thicker and sweeter then I prefer but it's still drinkable. Overall, this is one of the best DIPA buys out there. Its hard to turn it down when its fresh.","jamescain","May 08, 2013"

Thank god for Founders because the quality beers they put out makes it easier for us who miss out on Russian River, Three Floyds and such. This beer is why you have to drink craft beer because when you drink a beer like this you really want to thank the people who make them. This beer is extremely easy to drink and you will not notice the ABV so be warned ... go slowly and enjoy.","erialbill","Apr 25, 2013"

The grapefruit is very noticeable as well as the pine. It just doesn't come together for me. The feel is great, full bodied with a dry bitter finish. The price point is also way too high for what you get. To me this is the worst value in DIPA land.","screamking","Apr 24, 2013"

It’s not ground-breaking in any way, either, but it’s still damn good. It’s got a full and varied hop flavor with solid but never overwhelming bitterness, with an understated malt body that has a character of its own—but still knows to stay out of the way. Definitely a very good DIPA, and proof that Founders knows what they’re doing with this style of beer.","fmccormi","Apr 20, 2013"

Even thought I love intense hopiness it can mask the bad in a beer very well, I would think. The higher alcohal level in this one pulls more malltiness out of it and lets you feel alot more of the nice flavors underneath the hops. Great beer, great taste, definitely something I will return too.","skullforest","Dec 14, 2012"

4.3,2.1,3.5,3.5,5,4.5,4,"Well this is another winner in my book. It pours a hazy straw color eventually becoming clear. The head is minimal, but there is plenty of observable lacing. Smell is pine, resin, maybe even (maybe I'm crazy) mint. Mouthfeel is excellent. It is full and satisfying. Taste is a beautiful sweet fruit upfront and a pronounced bitterness on the finish followed by the warmth you might expect from a higher ABV volume beer. But it is amazing just how well this beer is balanced. The alcohol is well masked with the only real hint taste wise being the warm feeling at the very end. This beer is just pretty awesome!!!","Mojo","Sep 21, 2012"

Not that bitter is a terrible thing, it's just that usually when I'm wanting to enjoy an IPA I actually want to enjoy the flavors and not just the ridiculous boozyness. BUT, for it being 9.4%, I guess I can't complain. However, for $4 a bottle, I will definitely pass in the future.","SometimesIfart","Sep 20, 2012"

Those who aren’t fond of particularly rindy tastes need not apply. Personally, this reviewer prefers Bells Hopslam to this offering from Founders, but there is no question this is an excellent (and slightly cheaper) way to experience a delicious DIPA. The best thing Double Trouble has going for it is the way it keeps you coming back for another swig, and once there, it does not disappoint as it seems to get better and better towards the bottom of the glass. 16.5/20","THANAT0PSIS","Jun 14, 2012"

4.33,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy, yellowish, lemony, cloudy pils-ish, with extensive, sedimentary like lacing forming after each drink. The color surprising for a DIPA, I think. Nose is hoppy, coniferous, citrus-iferous, delightful. Taste is rich, clean malt up front, little roasted notes (which is good too), sweetish on the first taste, moderating subsequently. Hop follows cheifly with citrus assertiveness first, then some O-chemistry following. Mouthfeel is on the slightly thick-ish side, marginally syrupy, but overall, a super interesting approach to a DIPA and one I'll buy again. This is less alchol forward, and although all hopped up at 86 IBU's, you'd never know it given the great balance of this beer.","Bitter_Echo","Jun 03, 2012"

Pungent citrus hop aromas, grapefruit, ripe pineapple, with an underlying malt sweetness and pine hop aromas at the back end. Aroma gets boozy as this warms. Medium bodied with rich carbonation. Slightly resinous up front and creamier through the middle. Pine hop flavors up front that allow a citrus hop blast thru the middle the rides all the way to the end as the pine hop flavor returns. Pine hop bookends with citrus in between. Finishes with tongue clenching hop bitterness that lingers. Easily one of my favorite doubles.","IronLover","May 20, 2012"

While malt never really gains much purchase in the flavor of this beer, the malt component of the smell reminds of the wonderful Founder's Harvest Ale. Flavors are more reminiscent of Devil Dancer, although that other beer is more like a distilled and syrup-ified version this product. The hue is inspiring, indicative of a deep understanding by the brewers of how an IPA is supposed to look, although the conspicuous lack of head development detracts. It is a decent DIPA, although it could benefit from a shift of hop additions more toward the back-end.","beagle75","Apr 06, 2012"

It finishes with some lingering tartness, and you start ot feel the alcohol about 1/2 way through the glass.

Grapefruit flavors stand out as well in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is ok, could be a bit smoother, but still a nice medium mouthfeel, giving you a "chewing on hops" feel.

Aroma is wonderful - on the surface - a bouquet of lime, pineapple and grapefruit, while there is a hint of pine resin lurking beneath. A detect a wisp of something slightly powdery or soapy as well. The beer seems surprisingly light for a DIPA - especially given the ABV. This is actually a huge plus. As for the flavor, it is quite dry and straightforward. Pleasantly bitter. It's very good, but not bursting with citrus flavor or teeming with hop resin as the aroma suggests it might be. I am certain this is fresh as well. Solid, but not my fav.

Aroma is mostly citrusy hops (tropical fruit, orange peel, grapefruit), with some pine hops and some sweet malt noticeable too. The taste is similar to the aroma, the citrusy hops are strongest (grapefruit, orange peel and tropical fruit), and some pine hops and sweet malt flavors are also in there. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish, no surprise there. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's sticky and creamy with moderate carbonation.

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"First time trying this. Poured to a big pint glass. Color is light orange. Amazing nose of citrus, hops, and lots of melon. Lacing all the way down the glass and the head lasts the entire time I'm drinking. Tons of melon on the flavor. Lots of citrus and hops, with a bitter back end, but it's the melon that really stands out. Mouthfeel is medium and the bitter finish hangs on the tongue for quite a while. Very smooth and went down entirely too fast. 9.4 is very well hidden. Overall, this was really tasty. I've definitely had hoppier DIPA's, however the flavor stood out, and the melon was really nice. Yet another stud beer from Founders.","1Adam12","Jan 19, 2012"

Pours slightly hazy bright amber color with a huge 3 finger off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick lacing cap that lasts for the remainder of the glass. Some decent lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big grapefruit, floral, grass, pineapple, lemon, pine, and some herbal spiciness. Damn nice and fruity aromas here with good strength. Taste of strong grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, pine, and floral notes; with a bit of spice as well. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, grapefruit, pine, and spiciness on the finish for a while. Good balance of bitterness and sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel that drinks very smoothly for being over 9%. No alcohol noticed other than a small warming after the finish. Overall this is definitely a fantastic DIPA. Tons of fruity flavor, with great balance, and smooth drinking for the level of alcohol.","superspak","Jan 13, 2012"

I think it's lacking in some of the aromatic citrus notes I prefer in the nose of a hearty DIPA, but I understand that a lot of hops fade after a year of aging. Considering the IPAs I've had from Founders already, I'd say this one is pretty much on par with tho other ones I've had.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 05, 2012"

4.13,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall Impression- While enjoying the Centennial IPA weekly this past year, I was happy to come back to this 2X IPA from Founders again! I definitely recommend this one with its strong citrus hop flavors and punch to the mouth. A hop heads dream! I definitely didn't know this one was over 9% though! I had this for the first time @ the Founders Beer Dinner @ The Stable in Benton Park. Love coming back to good beers!","DCon","Nov 13, 2011"

3.78,-10.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A good DIPA, plenty of flavor, perhaps too sweet for my tastes, and the ethanol burn and obviousness is a bit of a let down. I'd look for slightly more balance between the alcohol, sweetness, and hops, though still expecting extremes in all of those. For me, the combination here just isn't the right one.","falloutsnow","Nov 09, 2011"

4.02,-4.5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Overall: This was one of the first DIPAs I ever had, so I love revisiting it. It still is a great no-coast IPA that provides that crazy burst of grapefruit that we Midwesterner hop-heads love!","JohnnyChicago","Oct 09, 2011"
4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This was my first DT. Impressed, but not blown away like i was with my first sixes of Hopslam. But they are different beasts.

4.69,11.4,4,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow. I can't believe just how light, fresh, aromatic and drinkable this is for 9.4% ABV.

3.75,-10.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O: This is a decent brew. I dig the matchmaking of the malts with the hops. This is not balanced, and rightfully so. As a DIPA, I would expect the beer to be dry, hoppy and crisp; kinda like a high quality czech pilsner on roids.","harrymel","Sep 16, 2011"
4.15,-1.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Well it's Founders so yeah it's good. Very solid brew, but not their absolute best and the bitterness and alcohol would prevent me from drinking more than 1-2 of these per sitting. Solid DIPA.","jmarsh123","Sep 14, 2011"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours crystal clear and scary yellow with a white head. Unadulterated grapefruity hop nose with super sharp grapefruit/citrus hop eyeopeners. Dry, bitter, grapefruity hop flavors..different hop variety than I’m used to out west, but nonetheless, i like the flavor profile generated from them regardless...pretty dry and hop forward for midwest, too...bitter, dry, grapefruity...tasty as all get up, really.","CushyGig","Sep 14, 2011"
4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Full-bodied, rich and not nearly as hoppy as I expected it would be. Fairly heavt coating of the palate, downright sticky. Fortunately, this is not a hop monster IPA like so many currently produced American, just a seriously good Imperial IPA","PorterLambic","Sep 12, 2011"

4.17,-1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy light orange-yellow with a 1 inch off-white head that settles to a small cap. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, pine, and some malt aromas. Taste is of sweet malt up front, followed by citrus zest and pine hops, and some pineapple/tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA with some nice hop and fruit flavors. I am glad I got to try one of these.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 09, 2011"
3.97,-5.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O- I've had this before (in the winter) and was a bigger fan of it then. Of course, this all boils down to preference, but I do prefer my IIPAs to be hop bombs and almost overwhelmingly so. As it stands, it's a great beer.","jm1229","Sep 07, 2011"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"(O) One thing I really like about this beer is it's a pretty straight forward brew. There's not a lot of complexity and it's a solid DIPA. You want a good hoppy beer but with the balance of a great malt foundation, this is a really good beer to reach for.","cjacobsen","Sep 02, 2011"
4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste is incredible. Like drinking a slightly foamy grapefruit juice. For a high alcohol beer there was very little alcohol impact. I felt a bit of dryness, but the mouth feel was full, creamy and lasting. I drank this with a bit of cheddar and nut thins for a nice complement.","Badbobx","Aug 25, 2011"
4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Nice. Very rich in flavor. More complex than the average Imperial IPA. Nice mix of malt and hops. A bit on the piney side, but still very pleasant. Everything stands out, nothing is completely overpowered.","soulfly1492","Aug 22, 2011"
3.95,-6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Pretty solid Imperial/Double IPA. This beer vaguely reminds me of what an amped up Two Hearted would be like. I enjoyed it.","jifigz","Aug 20, 2011"
3.65,-13.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall not to bad, especially if you're in to big hop flavor. It's just not my favorite DIPA. I think there are some others that are a bit better balanced. Certainly wouldn't turn this down, but probably won't pick up again.","jmshulk","Aug 19, 2011"
4.03,-4.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the soft nose. It had robust and present hops, but still seemed to keep a lighter edge, with subdued fruit and a milder grain. These acted to acutely balance out the big hop components, making for a well-balanced brew, but with a nice fresh bite.","TheBrewo","Aug 18, 2011"
4.07,-3.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured out as a nice golden yellow with some orange colors in there. The head was thick and white. The lacing looked really nice too after each sip. The smell of this beer is floral and citrusy, the nose is very fresh smelling and has a very inviting aroma to it. The taste of this beer is really nice also. I was really impressed with the flavors in the brew. The mouthfeel is a little thin but still pretty decent. Overall It's a really nice DIPA and worth getting if you see it.","Knapp85","Aug 17, 2011"
4.37,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall: Another very nice beer by Founders. One could have a few of these by flavor and drinkability alone, but the 9.4% ABV makes it a tough sell for a sessioner.","rhenning","Aug 14, 2011"
4.04,-4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: Very different DIPA and interesting. I think this is a brew I need to be in the right mood for but I won't knock it for this. Would try this again, but I'm not sure what I'd be looking for out of the next experience.","Klym","Aug 12, 2011"

4.15,-1.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"T: The malts hit first with some light caramel and a very slight breadiness. Then the hops come in with some notes of pepper, pine and grapefruit. The finish is on the grapefruit note and ends on both a sweet and bitter note. Pretty tasty.","notchucknorris","Jul 29, 2011"
3.97,-5.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A pretty decent DIPA, the hops definitely represented, in a non-left-coast manner, and balanced well enough. 86 IBUs? Sure. 9.4% ABV? Could have fooled me - oh, wait, it did.","biboergosum","Jul 28, 2011"
4.33,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"First Founders beer. Was super excited. Poured a medium amber with a small amount of head. Lacing was medium. Great nose. Grapefruit and citrus. Taste is well balanced.

3.93,-6.7,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"O: Pretty surprising for me. Very drinkable for a 9 percent. I think it drank more like a 6.5 or 7. All around a really really good option and good tasting DIPA. Not quite at the top of my list my really good.","lbower860","Jul 24, 2011"

4.27,1.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"a bit of honey a bit of pilsner hint and actually quite light and robust at the same time. pours a bit lighter then most... yellow a bit of murk. great protein with a sticky head and good hopping. nice is pine lemon with a pilsner hint in the back. palate is a nice tight floral first and foremost. sweet of honey malt hints. wouldn't say it drops off but it feel rather crisp. nice tingle. reminds me of the long trail for some reason... just as textbook feel but interesting accents.","rtepiak","Jul 22, 2011"
4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A very robust, flavorful and boozy DIPA at 9.4%, Double Trouble is just that indeed -- trouble. You likely won't go beyond a second one over the course of an evening session, and the big time hops and alcohol tinge might only play with a spicy Mexican dish.

4.09,-2.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours out of the keg golden in color with a thin head and some nice lacing. The look is appetizing, but doesn't do the beer justice on first inspection. Not to sell the taste/drink of this beer short, but the aroma off this beer is outstanding! Off the nose you get all kinds of citrus fruits - tangerines, oranges, grapefruits - which really showcase the high IBU levels of the beer. Despite the large nose, this beer is very well balanced by malts. While balanced, this is still a bruiser of an IPA. You're going to get resin and citrusy hops throughout the drink and finish of this beer. Overall, this is a great beer for all manner of beer lovers.","jmvecchio1","Jul 16, 2011"
3.94,-6.4,4.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Not a whole lot of clear flavors but well-crafted and interesting display of ingredients. Strong but never overbearing, it’s particularly interesting without a big malt backbone. It may be as much as 6 months old (the dates were smudged) but it still has an interesting quality, possibly because of the yeast strain. At any rate, I easily downed 2 and would hope to try on tap at some point.","Bfarr","Jul 15, 2011"

Chalk that up to personal preference. I would still encourage anyone who comes across this brew and likes IPAs/DIPAs of some fashion to give it a try. For me, just above average.

It smells of delicious grapefruit and has a light resinous hoppy aroma. God, this beer smells delicious! The flavor too is of fresh grapefruit and is wonderfully right in between sweet and bitter. The fruit is just downright superb. It drank light and very crisp. It has a nice bite and the alcohol is barely present at all. Overall this is a top notch beer and one of my favorites.

Taste is bitter resinous with apricots, grapefruit, hints of tropical fruit and a faint pale malt somewhere underneath all of this. Long lingering mild hop bitterness after every sip. Hop sap sticky resinous mouthfeel, medium level of bubbles and body. Great Dipa here.

I wish you could see my glass right now, I've got about 10 well defined lace rings on my glass, some of the best lacing I've ever seen. This perfect blend of pineapple malty sweetness followed by a very sharp, but pleasant resinous hops, followed by a wonderful alcohol warmth and satisfied smile means that I'll be purchasing lots of Double Trouble in the future.

As to the appearance it was hard to judge but taste and smell wise this thing was hoppy like a m-f****er as Samuel Jackson would say.

There was small moments of citrus hop flavor peeking through the bitterness and I would have liked the chance to experience them a little bit more. Overall all though this beer brings what the style promises - assertive hop bitterness and a smooth clean aftertaste. Surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer and it never gets boring - but still would like to see a bit more complex flavor come through the bitterness.","neophilus","Apr 18, 2011"

There was a lot of claims that this could go head to head with Hopslam, and after trying it I fully agree and would love to try the two side by side. Everything was on par for its style, a really well done DIPA that had great drinkablity, this one could sneak up on you if you aren't carefull . Even though it is 9.40% it never feels hot, just a little warming as it goes down, as it should be. I can't say enough good things about this beer, one of the best DIPA's I have had, its right up there with Hopslam. It is nice to know that if I miss out on hopslam next year I can still get my fix with this great brew. I am glad I bought this and will buy some more next time it is released. If you love the style or consider yourself a hop head you need to try this beer, it will cure what ails ya. Founders puts a 100% into all their brews and it really shows with this brew, and thats what makes them one of my favorite brewery's.","StoutHunter","Apr 17, 2011"

Strong grapefruit and fresh floral smells. The mouthfeel is just about perfect for a double IPA in my opinion. It's got that punch expected from the style, however theres a certain smoothness that really bring it together nicley.

4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy bright citrus golden with pure white foamy half inch head. Lacing hangs on down the tulip glass. Strong nose was picked up before the cap was fully off; so much hops in the auroma! All citrus and grapefruit. First sip reveals this to be a very hop-forward and dominate DIPA. Still mostly citrus hop taste, the faintest malt touch, and bitter/dry into the finish. Great mouthfeel, medium to heavy on the palate, still well carbonated. Almost no alcohol presence all the way down, amazing for a 9.4% beer. Overall, this is one of my all time favourite beers I've ever gotten to try! Great example of the American hop-bomb Imperial IPA. Wow, I really hope Founder's future expansion plans bring them permanently into Ontario. They are quickly becoming a favourite brewery.","heebes","Mar 20, 2011"
3.65,-13.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Both smell and taste contain an overabundance of hops. With the smell you get the strong scent of piney hoppiness and with taste you get a punch of hoppiness with a slight sense of sweetness that passes quickly and leaves the robust flavor of bitter hops in your mouth. And that flavor sticks for a while. The feeling it leaves is of a crisp, powerful IPA: A big bite with a hoppy aftertaste. Personally this is a strong IPA for me. I like an IPA with a little more balance to it, this beer seems to give too much hops. If you love hops and just hops in your beer than this beer is a winner. As for me I did enjoy it but just a hint too much bitter with only a little malt or sweetness to balance it out.","danielsonc","Mar 19, 2011"

It's three months old, and while age certainly accounts for the hops fading I'm having a tough time rationalizing this much fade. What flavor I can pick up is good, so I really want to try this brew when it's fresh. So, with that said...Founder's has not yet disappointed me with any of their brews, so I will absolutely seek this one out again to get me some fresh hoppy goodness.

Clean malt snaps its way in the middle and a slight spice makes a peek towards the finish. Lingering bitterness ensures you won't forget what style slowly depletes from your glass.

4.01,-4.8,3.5,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Notes - A truly great beer for me. Its not the hoppiest Ive had but the combination of citrus, hops and pine are favorites of mine. I like double IPAs and this is one of the best Ive had.","BeerForMuscle","Mar 07, 2011"
4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D- Not very hard to drink but overall I feel this is a very average IIPA. Yes, it is hop and bitter and that is good, but that seems to be the only thing going on here. I would try it again, but I would not go out of my way to try it.","larryi86","Mar 07, 2011"
3.85,-8.6,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Decent DIPA, one worth checking out. Many people enjoy this beer but I have a couple issues with it. The hop flavor does not come off clean and that really effects the beer all the way through. The way the flavor just digs into and lays on the tongue really hurts the beer. One in my limit, after that I need to move to something a bit cleaner.","kzoobrew","Mar 07, 2011"
4.07,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Overall, a decent DIPA and a solid effort from Founders. This isn't the greatest DIPA by any means, but it is still quite good. This is only the fourth beer I've had by Founders and I'm already finding them to be one of my favorite breweries and it is starting to seem like they can pull anything off that they set their minds to. This one is certainly worth a try. Cheers!","SkunkWorks","Mar 07, 2011"

Poured from a keg tapped just 4 days prior, it looked very promising with it's staying head, and deep body. The nose brought a strong hop smell but a predominant smell of body odor. The taste is the same with some sweet malt flavors and hop bitterness and pine resinous feelings/flavors. I say this from a very objective standpoint as I was looking forward to trying this beer for the first time, but I must say, a disappointment.","wcintula","Mar 06, 2011"

On the nose it's a hop attack of citrus with some wet straw, orange, and especially grapefruit all there in a really pungent head. In the mouth there is a buzzsaw of hop bitterness, a very citrusy IPA, mostly grapefruit. The medium body keeps the bitterness hanging around for a long finish with maybe just a touch of alcohol, which is pleasing.

Big white frothy head, faded and left a large amount of lace on the top that stayed till the bottom. Glass was lined with lots of gooey lace that dripped down the glass, very nice looking. Smell was very strong, lots of fresh hops, pine resin the biggest factor here with hints of alcohol, which at nearly 10%abv is not a surprise. The flavor was un real, and very strong. Big alcohol and pine resin hit me first. Huge DIPA flavor and right up my alley. After it warmed some more subtle citrus tones started to come through. Some pineapple and grapefruit flavors fought with the unrelenting pine resin taste. Awesome strong bitter finish,Great full and crisp mouth feel, and very dry at the end. Have to be careful with the ABV which can sneak up on you.","mikesgroove","Feb 26, 2011"

Aroma is very strong pine and grapefruit. The taste starts off malty, then immediately followed by a burst of intense, but nice bitter hops with a strong pine flavor to it. A malty and citrusy sweetness lingers throughout the session. The ABV is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Decent carbonation. I really enjoyed this DIPA especially on tap.","CuriousMonk","Feb 24, 2011"
4.27,1.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D-- West Coast meet Midwest. Or something like that. To me more of a very good take on a West Coast DIPA but with twists.

Well hidden ABV and can or want to drink two in a sitting.","mulder1010","Feb 24, 2011"

4.6,9.3,4.5,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy gold with one finger of off-white head that sticks and clings to whatever it touches. Complex aromas that are hop-forward (floral, resinous, citrusy) but packed with sweet malty notes of honey. The taste is nothing short of amazing. The hops are aggressive but extremely well-balanced.

It also reminds me of the Ballast Point with that almost off putting smell with the ridiculous amount of hops and probably the hop variety they use mixing together to create a huge unusual aroma you normally aren't used to smelling in a beer. You can also taste the grapefruit hops. I've found with these types of higher alcohol IPA's they are best to warm a bit and the bitterness and mouthfeel really come out to play.

The nose comprises grapefruit, melon, leeks, light caramel, and light honey. The taste holds notes of pine, yellow grapefruit, light leek, and very light caramel. The body straddles the border between heavy light and light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a fine DIPA, but it's very one-sided in favor of dry hops.

Not overly potent, I would like to hope that this which is as new as I could have reasonably gotten it isn't already past it's prime. The mouthfeel is the standard bitterness, but not nearly as frustratingly acidic as many other beers that I've had. I can't believe this is a DIPA, it has the lightness of a regular IPA.

Toast and fresh bread in the nose, with lots of piney, citric and tropical hops, and a breath of alcohol. The malts smell great and are well-integrated with the strong dose of hops. It has a delicious malt flavor as well, lightly sweet, with orange, pine, pineapple and tobacco-flavored hops that impart loads of bitterness. Medium body, with low carbonation and a nice long bitter finish. It's great to finally have a double IPA that isn't overloaded with crystal malts.

I found myself captured by the intense lime and malt smell, with a little corn , wheat, malt, and grapefruit. Creamy and zippy as the brew washed over my tongue, upper palate and rear upper palette. I will get more of this beer. I was sorry when I found myself looking at the bottom of my glass and there was no more of the exotic brew left.

The aroma is of citrus, floral hops and some caramelized malts. The taste starts out a strong burst of fruity citrus sweetness and another strong burst of hops bitterness that complement each other well. The malt character is on the thin side for the style and it allows the hoppy and sweet flavors to be more intense. Likewise the after-taste is sweet and hoppy.

Solid malt backbone, and a hint of alcohol in here as well. I wanna get into this now. Hint of the malt and the hops lead the assault here, chased on its heels with a significant bitterness and a light wave of alcohol. Mostly pineapple and orange in the hops here. Wow this is solid. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-high carbonation and the drinkability is through the roof. The alcohol pops its head through at the end of every gorgeous sip, teasing me.

Complex with hints of grapefruit, tangerine, tea, orange, and pine. Just enough sweetness to keep it honest. Slightly medicinal as the alcohol warms from start to finish. Nice, crisp, dry finish that's a bit resiny at the same time. And even though the alcohol isn't totally hidden, it's still quite drinkable. I'm three for three with Founders beers.

It does not have the hop intensity or as rich and complex flavors as some DIPAs, but that's not all bad. The balance of the fruit and hops makes this a worthy DIPA.

4.32,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours more like a wheat beer than a IPA, cloudy with a sun-kissed hue vs the amber rust of a traditional IPA. There is a slight creamy head that sticks to the edge of your glass. The alluring aroma has a fairly standard sweet pine vapor, maybe a little sweeter than most IPA's but it definitely draws you in. When first you touch glass to lips visions of the mad scientists at Founders pureeing whole hops and stuffing them into bottles dance through your cranium. A very powerful pungent spice hits you like a ton of bricks. Either you raise your glass in triumph or recoil in horror. This beer is not for those who enjoy a pale, but for those who wish hops to become one with their soul. A sweet piney bitterness surrounds the experience. A dominant sweet taste rushes the palette at first with a strong bitter backside. After a few deep pulls at 9.4 A.B.UV. a warmth rushes the body. The lines are drawn either you praise the hop gods or you cruse spending 9 bucks on a 4 pack!

I get lots of honey from this (similar to Bell's Hop Slam IMO). The high abv is present but is balanced well with the honey, fruits, malts, and hops. The mouthfeel is awesome and not too thin, not to thick. Drinkability is scary considering the abv. I could get myself into some trouble if I could get this beer where I live.

Tasted citrusy, also strong pine. Had a nice bitter aftertaste. Aftertaste hung around your mouth for a while. Felt a little thick in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. After three swallows, I could feel the effect of the alcohol. My stomach got warm. It felt like I had a shot of booze. Ill buy these again. I just think you would have to be very carefull.

I realize that double IPA is a bit a of a daredevil beer by definition, but this beer misses the mark on hop character by a wide margin. It is not done artfully or well, just brash and decadent. The intensity is not fresh or floral, but resiny and overpoweringly grapefruit. I think even the most extreme beers need just a modicum of balance. There was none.

Taste was very good and the hops blended well with the fruity bite of citrus present. I could detect some alchohol after the finish but not unpleasant. This beer reminded me of hopslam a lot but with a more pronounced hop dominance probably due to the lack of honey. Mouthfeel was a medium- sharp sensation with the right amount of carbonation.

I think its worth mentioning that the 9.4 % abv is incognito, little to no alcohol burn to the nose or mouth. As usual with the Founders brews this beer is thick with ideal carbonation for my palate.

The citrus taste is much more subdued than I was expecting. The pine come to the fore front on this beer and in a great way. The bitterness doesn't linger too long which leaves a nice finish. Overall this is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have had. I am curious to see how I have ranked it compared to others I have had, but it should be up there if not at the top.

Not that Founders needs any of the praise since it almost seems that they float above the ground. Mind you, it is an extraordinary brewery but nobody should scape from some critical analysis and Founders, good as they are, seems to get away with things others don´t. This is not necessarily their fault but is surely due in part the cultural vibe that is building around them, at least in the region from where I´m writing. Double Trouble is well above an average offering, and the nose is rather close to that of Hopslam, but the appearance is nowhere near it.

There is a ton of ABV on the back end of this beer and it has a throaty burn for sure. The sweet ABV is there long after the finish.

Its one that I'd recommend, and I'll enjoy the rest of the four-pack. But for me there still is nothing quite like Hopslam. $9.99 for a four pack is fair, and worth it.

It does smell hoppy, but there is much more going on. The taste is slightly hoppier than the aroma, and there is a firm bitterness in the sip and more so in the aftertaste. The lemon and cream soda are still there, but they are much less prominent. This beer has a nice , but it doesn't intrigue me the way the aroma does. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture, and a lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good DIPA.

Overall the look and smell of this was a let down but the exlosive hop profile on the finish was a nice touch, more sweet on the front end. I want to be fair, I am not sure how old this bottle was and this could be better if it was fresh.","gunnerman","Jul 22, 2009"

The mouth feel is adequately carbonated, tangy and smooth...a gateway to the full sweet and citrus flavors. This is one classic Double IPA...and a very easy drinker. Oh!

Solid murk lends translucency to the light orange to yellow colored liquid, traps the light to increase luminescence. Somewhat high-toned nose, zips through there without much thought on sitting for a spell, pine needle and grass sourness and then more slightly bitter tea leaf scents hit you first, honestly the first few sniffs you miss the caramel and butterscotch notes, mandarin orange to white grapefruit citrus also has your nostrils on edge, as it starts to dissolve the peach, apricot scents almost an afterthought. Full-bodied, dense and doesn't get more than an inch or so into the mouth before sinking in fully. The carbonation may be too fine to cajole things back into motion. Some bitters but mostly grass, green hay and pine bark next to sour grapefruit pith. As in the nose, the caramel and malts in general too little, too late. Sweetest part is the apricot, peach, guava fruit, adds some residual sugar. More scone or muffin baked good qualities than breadiness. Very dry finish, overall the flavor intensity and weight last until the very end.","farrago","Jul 15, 2009"

The head and lacing was white and minimal. The aroma was mainly dominated by hops. There was a pleasant hop-candy note and the typical citrus. Higher alcohol was also present in the aroma but not overly assertive. The flavor was dominated by an extremely assertive hop bitterness, which I expected. What I did not expect was the beer to be "hot", an out-of-balance alcohol flavor. This high phenolic character distracts from any subtle hop or yeast notes that are most likely there. Overall, this is a big beer in every department. Unfortunately, a possible oversight during fermentation caused it to be a little too big.","RiekerStarBrew","Jul 13, 2009"

A mix of sappy and citrusy hops enter the mouth and are thick on the tongue. Very marmalade like with more of an edge to rind on the citrus profile. Really silky and mineral based, maybe a bit oily on the back of the tongue. Bitterness turns more piney and thick as you continue to drink. Mouthfeel falls right in line with this.

I quickly scooped it up because I love Founders and anything Michigan I can find now that I'm stuck in central IL aka the beer void of America. Cool looking label also. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep cloudy yellow color with a slight orange tinge and a HUGE frothy head that sticks around all day. The smell is a huge hit of hops; spicey, citrusy, piney and resinous. There is also a sweet malty backdrop that complements the hops nicely. No solventy alcohol smells. That is one excellent smelling DIPA. The taste only confirms what I thought about the smell, hop bomb but not in an overly bitter, mouth puckering way. All the flavor is there but it lacks that sharp bitterness that turns some people off from huge hoppy beers like this one. The citrusy, piney hops are nicely balanced with a solid backing of slightly sweet maltiness. There is only a hint of alcohol in the finish in a warming characteristic but I would never guess this rings in at 9.4%. The mouthfeel is full bodied and has a velvety smooth carbonation, almost like a nitro tap. Drinkability, considering the high ABV and IBUs is huge. I would drink this all the time if that was an option. I really like Founders in general, but I think this may be my new favorite.

Smell is of floral citrusy notes and a bit of malt. Taste is very citrusy hops coming threw with it's partner being floral flavors.

It is very drinkable yet there is a decided alcohol warmth that announces itself en route southward. Otherwise, this is a friendly, pleasant DIPA that does not pack as obvious a punch as many DIPA's yet satisfies the serious hop head palate.

I've tasted it cold and I've had it at the proper temperature, and it's really not fair to the beer to drink it cold. When it's warm, it's very easy to appreciate pine sap, tropical fruits, apricots, fresh tart apples and floral notes. All of these are very nice, but the candied pineapples are amazing. Caramel and toffee gain in prominence as it warms. The finish is nice and bitter; everything I was hoping for. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with perfect carbonation.

This beer pours a nectarine orange with a nice white fluffy head that leaves a decent amount of lace as it disappears from my glass. The aroma is a hop smack to the olfactory nerve. Huge notes of apricot and pink grapefruit. Just a slight hint of a malty sweetness. The flavor is just about the same. If you're looking for a DIPA that's malt bill lives up to the hop bill, this is not it. Huge notes of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest with a blast of alcohol at the finish. There is also a almost medicinal bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is light with very little malt body. Also the hop flavor doesn't coat the mouth like it does in many DIPA's. To me this is more like boozy hop water then a DIPA. Give this beer some body and mellow out the alcohol burn and this beer could be fantastic.","hwwty4","Mar 26, 2009"

Th aroma is a bitter orange zesty nectar with some gummi bear sweetness. The coarse, bitter hop citrus nectar hits the palate upfront. Some dry pilsner malts mix to cut some of the hop bitterness that evolves into somthing a little more resiny and smooth for the finish. This a a hop bomb sipper in my opinion. Well integrated 9.4% alcohol too.","scruffwhor","Mar 25, 2009"

Overall, medium-bodied and slightly smooth with some chewey, malty breadiness in there for a slightly sweet sensation. Finishes dry thanks to some herbal hop bitterness.

Drinks more like a juiced up bitter IPA, if fact it kinda reminds me of Smuttynose, but obviously a little more boozy. Decent finish. Overall a pretty good Double, but I really like my citrus monsters, and I don't get even a hint of Grapefruit with this one which knocks the taste back a notch. I can appreciate an earthy piney brew, and this one is more so than I remember.

Remarkably, no real bitterness along with this very citrus and hoppy taste. I was looking and hoping for some bitterness in the finish from a DIPA, but the citrus kick up front stays put.

Waves of pine resin and grapefruit citrus rise from the glass to the nose. The beer strikes the mouth thick with an alcohol warmth. While the hops attack in a floral pine bite, they are backed equally by a toasty malty backbone of sweet balance. The hops never subside, the tongue tingles from their spice, but the malt continues to deliver sweet burnt caramel. Grapefruit citrus swirls around the mouth. After it's gone, the tingle of hops and the warm glow of 9.4% abv are the obvious remains. this is a huge beer that brings a massive balance between a mountain of hops and an ocean of malt. The alcohol takes a flavor back seat but punches harder than some 11%s I've had (unearthly for one). To steal from Shaefer: this is the one beer to have when you're having only one! Afterwards, the mouth is corrupted and the mind is fogged. Founders has balanced it's no-prisoners hop attack with a huge malt presence that warms the mouth.

As expected, it was a lot like Dogfish 90 minute.. strong hop presence but balanced with a strong malt backbone as well.. The aroma is all hop, but a bit mroe earthy than the typical citrusy, pine-like hop aroma.. Flavor is also, obviously, very hoppy yet with that malty sweetness lurking just behind the floral front.

Pour gives off a light, clear golden color, which seems a bit unorthodox for this style. Usually you get darker tinges of orange and even red, but anyway, large white heading comes through. Complex nose, one that you should take your time with. I get honeysuckle, alcohol, pineapple, mango, bit of bees wax. Hops show themselves a lot more in the taste, with the hops beginning with a spicy edge, and then some tiny amount of fruit, and ending on a dry bitter note. Mouthfeel is light to medium, which is another oddball quality of this beer; still love it. Alcohol is very well hidden, although there were times when vodka popped in to my mind upon tasting.

Sweet, sugary citrus hop oils stick to the tongue...that's about it, but it's done so damn well. Like biting into an orange. Medum-full body, creamy and yet almost crisp in the finish.

After the head fades a bit, you get a bit more of the alcohol smell. The taste is far less hoppy. You get this resinous, sticky feel, with a kind of piny taste, and there's quite an alcohol taste. There's kind of a fake fruity taste in there, like candy fruit flavors without the sweetness. Very dry. The mouthfeel is actually very nice. It kind of warms you inside, and is quite smooth.

I can tell this will be a hop bomb...Taste starts off with those big citrus hops but with a good amount of bitter flavor mixed in as well. Midway a touch of caramel malt and a hefty dose of spruce and earth. For some reason the aftertaste is pretty weak which is odd for such a hop monster.

The head is a solid two fingers deep and off-white in color. Smells of grass, stinky citrus and piney hops with very little malt presence. Did they dry hop this with skunk weed? Upon my first sip, a huge flood of bitterness attacks my taste buds. Notes of white grapefruit, lemon peel, and pine needles, more bitterness, and an almost non-existent malt backbone. Finish is dry and a little boozy. Medium in both body and carbonation. I'd drink it again.","ClockworkOrange","Feb 04, 2009"

When I finally brought the glass close to my nose I got alot of lemon, a little pine and more citrus smells. Hops are very prevelant but do not dominate at all. Very easy drinker for having almost 10% abv. I could put a few of these down but I would certainyl be rocked. Feeling buzzed already from just one. Excellent example of a double ipa.

There's also a hint of "malt rot", that's probably not as accurate as it could be but it's what I get out of some DIPA's (such as this one in a small way and Double Crooked Tree in a big way). The taste is a strong suit, all the citrus elements from that aroma with some abrasiveness on the tongue, bitter but not too much in the aftertaste, good malt balance, very nice.

Further on, the sweet citrus becaomes more dominant with some grapefruit and sweet tropical fruit notes. Taste is the sweet citrus flavor riding a medium body with a nice malt backbone. There is a sprite like sweetness as well that blends into a peppery bitterness and finishes with a nice dryness and some evergreen flavor. A highly drinkable beer for me, one of those beers where every sip makes you crave another.
