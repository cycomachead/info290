3.72,-4.9,4.5,3.75,3.75,3,3.75,"Final Word: A take it or leave it IPA, unless you are a true hop lover. While the higher ABV came through a bit too much in the flavor profile, that was really my only complaint with this beer, and my neutral opinion of it is due to the fact that it didn’t present anything unique or out of the ordinary for the style. The hop flavor was exceptionally pure and fresh on the tongue, but didn’t have quite enough malt character throughout to keep the piney bitterness in check. Hop lovers will adore this beer, due to the aforementioned freshness and purity, which really is the strength of this brew, but other drinkers will likely find it a bit unbalanced and strong, seeking more well rounded IPAs instead. I’ll never tell you not to order this one, but I’ll most likely always recommend another.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jul 24, 2014"

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, peach, citrus rind, floral, grass, caramel, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, orange peel, floral, grass, citrus rind, caramel, bread, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a crisp and moderately slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around great complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 28, 2014"

3.94,0.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"This ale pours a very cloudy Orange brown color with a lot of sediment in the pour. It gives a small white head that gives way to a thin white film and very little lacing. The nose is extremely malty and rich but at the same time one note. The flavor on the other hand is much deeper and more complex than I expected. There is an abundance of malt up front (and some of it seems roasted giving a slight coffee bite to the beer). But behind that there is the bitter bite of a great double ipa. This is no west coast ipa but it still gives that pleasant bitter tingle on the tongue. There is also a slight alcohol bite that is pleasant and a great reminder of what this beer is. Id love to try another bottle of this, a little fresher next time to see if the hops take the foreground or if it meant to be malt forward. All in all a great pour from an unfamiliar brewery.","lochef81","Feb 14, 2014"

It had a very nice hop profile that was bitter and flavorful with the dank hoppiness that always pulls me in. The Small Batch IPA had a slightly sweet finish but left a nice lingering bitterness.

Not thick and goes down pretty clean. Average light penetration. Tastes like an IPA should, hoppy with notes of pine, citrus and maybe something more grassy. Hoppy, but not so much for a """double hopped""" IPA. Overall, a good IPA. Would definitely drink again, but I can't say this one in any way tops or distinguishes itself from the bulk of IPAs.","JeffBrenner","Aug 17, 2013"

Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the glass after the pour. Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid hop aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 30, 2013"

Smell is big juicy citrus fruits, I'm getting grapefruit and mandarin oranges. There is also some alcohol in the nose. Taste is just like the smell, but in reverse order; alcohol bathes the tongue in heat before thick, sweet malt takes over followed by the sweet fruit. Finish is very bitter hops destroying everything until just a lingering bitterness and malt stickiness remain.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 18, 2013"

Usual American hop suspects - Simcoe, Chinook, and Centennial listed. Pine with some orange zest and fresh thyme. Hops aren't aggressive but are vibrant and juicy. Malt lends a biscuit and light caramel flavor. A lingering sweetness softens however many IBUs are present. A solid DIPA with a nice hop oil texture. Not close to the best in the style but certainly enjoyable.","bump8628","Jan 08, 2013"

Smells of sweet, somewhat roasted malt with floral and fruit hops, and not much pine on the nose. Taste is very good and balance, rising sweet malt at first, and then hops and bitterness that runs and runs...great sustain here. Mouthfeel is right there, and alcohol is contained with the profile, and carbonation is fuzzy and fussy and lovely and everything. I really like this brew.","Bitter_Echo","Nov 27, 2012"

A great sweet, citric aroma of some grapefruit, lemon, and orange on top of a bready underbelly. Flavor matches the aroma quite well. Some definite sweetness to this, some great citric fruitiness, a nice malt underbelly, and then in the end some bitterness shows itself. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice active mouthfeel to this, around medium modied and crisp. Overall, probably the best Breckenridge beer I have tried. I was really surprised by this one in the best of ways.","denver10","May 17, 2012"

It had a pretty nice mouthfeel, but the taste was only average to me. I think the kicker was a lingering bitterness that I haven't really encountered with other DIPAs.

3.94,0.8,3,4,4,4,4,"O: The combination of the visual and the taste of this beer really makes me feel like this is a fresh JW Lees Harvest Ale. The flavors seemed so familiar, and it once I made that connection I really have been unable to separate these beers. Obviously there's a difference in gravity, and in the intention of consumption, but this has a strikingly similar (but much much lighter) flavor profile. With all that in mind, I have to admit I liked this beer. The lightly chewy leathers with the slow release of juicy flavors from dried fruits made this an unexpected pleasure. The dried fruit flavors are intensely bright, but still have that unmistakably muskiness that reeks of dried fruits. Unexpected ones too: Pineapples, persimmons, tangelos. This was unusual to drink, and hid the alcohol amazingly well. I'd really like to try this fresh from the source to give me an idea as to how old this was. I suspect this was quite old, as there wasn't even the slightest bit of hops present.","Cavery","Sep 02, 2011"

Thanks to Jonathan for this hard earned sample. Even though I received this for free I must rate on price. This is a $16 six pack or an $8 bomber.

The little later left some great lacings on the side of the glass. Aroma was slighty fruity that intermingled with a bitter hops. Also picked up slighty traces of a spicy vanilla. Taste was remarkably balanced. Started off hoppy with just a taste of lactose, became more malty, and then finishing up with hops again. Felt nice and solid in the mouth. Slightly creamy with a tad of tingle on the tongue at the end. Overall a great beer. Not my normal cup of tea, but very drinkable and well balanced, reasonable for the cost as well.","mountdew1","Aug 13, 2011"

4.05,3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Breckenridge 471 IPA pours a mildly opaque orange. The dirty white head comes up to about three fingers in height. The lacing left behind is very nice, but retention is a little bit brief. The nose is fairly balanced, with some caramel sweetness laying a base for a note of grapefruit with a more tropical edge that has suggestions of mango. The flavor doesn't have as much of a malt base as the aroma would have suggested, but the caramel is still definitely there. I was a bit worried when I read that this beer has both Centennial and Simcoe hops, as I'm not usually a fan of either of those hops. Together though, they seem to work, as the fruitiness of the Simcoe blunts the usual aggressive edge of the Centennial's grapefruit flavor, and the pungent Centennial takes the harshness away from the Simcoe hops. The body is more than solid, it's impressively light for a 9%+ beer, and helps let the hops shine through. The carbonation is fine, enough to elevate the hop flavors and aromas, but it stops short of being bubbly. I was a little let down by my first Breckenridge beer (Vanilla Porter), but this one has made a much better impression.","axeman9182","Beers"

The taste leans more toward the caramel and honey, but finishes with some prominent orange peel, grapefruit peel, pine, and cantaloupe. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally dry finish. Overall, a nice DIPA, with an enjoyable balance between the malts and the hops.

The citrus floral marriage continues on the palate and tongue with a full on frontal assault with brutal hop savagery and little detectable malt. This is typically not exactly my favourite style, but occasionally I really enjoy a super hoppy, American style IPA, and I really enjoyed this beer. I must say, too, that it drinks miles below its proclaimed 9,2%. I personally wouldn't drink a whole lot of these simply because I'm not a big hop guy.

I feel as if my allergies are going to be activated. It's heavy on the hops (of course), very pine cone-like, and sour citrusy like old grapefruit. I like it. Heavy oily texture with a bitter bite. Tastes like pine tree sap that has been thinned out with grapefruit juice and a regular stregnth IPA. Wow. You really have to like this style to appreciate the complexities of this beer. The foam is stuck to the side of the glass as I sip it down. I have to say that I really like this beer but only one or two of them at a time.

A nice, rich honey color sitting lazily in the glass. Good lacing; it says I was here and left my mark proudly. The aroma is remarkably subduded for a heavy-hitting DIPA. Smells like hops, but not pungent hops. It is sort of a distant, echoed growl that warns you of the dangers should you enter this dragon's lair. Mmmm. I like the wyrm. Rich, full sweeter malt flavors with rigid hop backing. I would call it 'malt-centric' without caring if that is a real word or not. Reminds me of Stoudts DIPA in a good way.

The piney hops never quit, but it is a little sweet which hinders its drinkability. I am enjoying the mouthfeel as the hops are giving my mouth a bit of a sting with moderate carbonation.

Tastes like a standard (good) DIPA, with a lighter medium-body that passes easily and smooth and leaves a citric hop taste throughout your mouth and is balanced with those sweet malts, for a dry but satisfying backbite.

3.54,-9.5,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint with a glowing amber cloudiness. A thin white head was persistant and generated a clinging lace throughout. My sense of smell is poor so I like the punch in the nose of a pine/grapefruit hop-bomb of a DIPA. On that score, this disappoints. It smelled crisp with a hint of citrus. It flowed into my mouth with a thick rich feel. The warmth of the alcohol strikes first, followed by the sting of hops in a soft blanket of malt. The initial promise of a citrus balance goes unfulfilled. It finishes with a hot alcohol burn again mitigated by the sweetness of the malt. While the hops are clearly present, they lack the clear distinction of pine resin, instead imparting a sharp tingle. The welcome warmth of the alcohol becomes the defining (and not unpleasant) characteristic of this DIPA. Nothing wrong with this one, but other, bolder DIPAs will draw me away.","biker30x","Jan 06, 2009"

Apparent hops aroma with some pine and citrus hints. Caramel background offsets the heavy amount of hops a DIPA requires. Definitely a nice balanced taste, which can be troublesome with a brew of this level of alcohol. That effervescence takes a little bit away from it in the mouth, but it is to be expected with DIPA, I guess. Guess down easy for the ABV, and definitely something I'd like to have again.

This just doesn't seem right or balanced to me. This seems like it has champagne attributes, but I don't think it is intentional. Overall I have to say this was not as good as I hoped it would be.

It's 9.2ABV but you can't taste it which is a pleasant surprise. If not for the ABV, it's almost a session IPA. Overall, another good outing from Breckenridge and definitely worth trying.

Solid bitterness with plenty of sweet malt for balance. Lots of fruity character, grapefruit and pine resin linger in the finish. The hops have a spiciness to them as well and there's a bit of alcohol warmth. Medium/full bodied with crisp carbonation up front that mellows quickly.

But then there's that ABV that is not only cloaked, but so well incorporated that it could very well knock you silly before you realize you've been smacked.

The flavor was very grassy and wheaty, with an upfront maltiness, followed by a quick bitter finish. Not exactly the hop bomb I was expecting.

While people have claimed that the heat shouldnt have affected it, I beg to differ. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer pours a medium orange, forming no head or lacing, and barely any carbonation (I think this is what the heat did to it.) The aroma is intensely strong hops, in a very good way. The taste is strong hops, citrus, and maybe a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. A highly drinkable double IPA. Overall, aside from the fact that the appearance was weak, this was a good beer. It didnt have the harsh swallow that alot of hoppy beers have. The flavor was good and full. I enjoyed it.

I thought I might've been crazy at first picking up some buttery notes, but, sure enough, this is made with an English yeast strain. Fruity esters, caramel, toasted malts, stone fruits, grass, and earthy, herbal hops all play very well together. Not too sweet and, with only 70 IBUS, this doesn't try to strip your tongue off.

Heavily understated nose, with just a hint of caramelly grapefruit pith and a chemical smell bordering on sulfuric. A bit more pronounced flavor, with sugared grapefruit sections leading the way. In the middle there is a brief flash of a crystal malt sweetness, but this disappears quickly under a slightly ferrous mineral quality that weaves in between phases of finishing hop bitterness. Overall, however, this is a very muted taste for an IPA. The consistency of this beer is indeed syrupy, as the 9.2% abv would indicate. Its dextrinous quality is not unpleasant, but for a beer with such girth, I usually expect a severe blast of flavor. This one doesn't deliver, unfortunately.

Definitely a sweet IPA in comparison to some hop monsters, maybe just a slight bit too sweet for my palate. Mild citrus mixed with lots of caramel. Fruitcake is in evidence as is some comforting bready taste. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, very thick and chewy with that big, big malt presence. The palate dries as the beer slides down the throat. This is a sessionable IPA, alcohol is very well hidden, and the combination of a creamy mouthfeel and the great balancing act it maintains between bitter/sweet is very well done.

Then the citrus hops come barreling 'round the corner and hit you again like a grapefruit to the forehead-beautiful. This IPA flat out rules and is a serious delight to my senses. The hops are intense, yet meld with the malt to give just enough body to please. Aroma is still pungent to the last drop. This is hands down one of the best IPA's I've had all year.

I don't _quite_ want to say it's not hoppy enough ... okay, it's not hoppy enough ... but it IS pleasantly hoppy. It's almost as if they tried to tone down the bitterness part of the hoppiness, if that makes sense. Anyway, ripe grapefruit, herbal hints, perhaps a bit of clove. Very nice. Mouthfeel was nice and carbonated, like an IPA should be, IMHO. Phenols coat the tongue nicely. This ale is extraordinarily drinkable - so drinkable that I wish I'd gotten more.

Aroma was typical of an American IPA with pine, grapefruit, and grass notes imparted by the hops, and malt sweetness I was not anticipating. Tasted like it smelled, and Id have been surprised if it didnt. The taste exhibited a harmonious interplay between the grapefruit citric notes and the snappy spicy bitterness of the hop varieties. Sweetness of the malt was there in a sufficient strength the keep the hops from getting too out of hand. Mouthfeel was somewhat gritty and sticky for an IPA, and the aftertaste supplied a lingering dry bitterness. Alcohol seemed a bit too present and warming for an IPA, until I looked up the strength. And I was surprised to see a 9.2% up there. At that strength it is at the upper end of the DIPA scale, and for that style this is quite a subtle alcohol presence. This was, much easier to drink than most DIPAs. Didnt quite match the ease of gulping down of a regular American IPA, but it came too close to be a very dangerous beer.","rajendra82","Aug 24, 2005"

In my opinion all of the flavors here are dead on, the hops are very fresh and have an excellent flavor, while the malt body is almost perfect for an IPA.

As for the taste, theres no question that the hops are the key players here. There is a bit of sweet orange and citrus fruitiness along with a good deal of fresh pine and cedar up front followed by raw hop oils and tannins that leave a strong bitterness on the back of the tongue in a lasting sticky aftertaste that remains until the next sip.

Held up to the nose, this beer is fantastic. Hops to the extreme. It is bold and fresh. Almost impossible to remove the glass from my nostrils. Grapefruit and a nice floral, piney aroma help complete a memorable and well balanced smell. 471 tastes sharp, and hopped up. The initial quaff is followed by a distinct citrus bitterness. It reminds me a bit of grapefruit without any sugar. Bold and tasty to me, but could easily offend anyone who prizes smoothness over sharpness. Alcohol is definitely noticeable in the aftertaste. In the mouth the main sensations are fullness and bitterness. Just how I like it. This beer's flavor holds throughout, both during and after its presence on the tongue. Overall one 22 oz. is enough, and perhaps best enjoyed splitting with a friend. Packed with flavor and a high alcohol content, definitely a good sipper.

After much thought and searching they also have a piney character and also a pink cotton candy flavor. Just as delicious hop profile with a nice hop bitter to counter. Also a potent rough co-humulone grassy to keep things honest. Malt flavor is quite minimal, a chalky munich malt and maybe some caramel from crystal malt. Fruity esters may be present, but they're either buried beneath or blended into the hop flavors. Now that the beer has warmed, I get a gentle alcohol sting in the nose and alcohol burn late in the taste. The aftertaste is quite floral hoppy with a strong tangerine taste.

4.6,17.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: very smooth and nicely balanced, very hoppy but the bitterness doesn't affect the overall drinkability; even better on tap","gimmehead","May 21, 2005"
3.91,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours an oranged coppery color with a small head that falls to ring the top. The nose is slightly bready, caramel, with a slightly citrusy and earthy hop. The flavor is better than the nose. A nice caramel base, thick and chewy, with a bright citrusy hop over top. The flavors meld well together. The feel is on the thick end of moderate, with a light carbonation. Overall, I find it to be very drinkable. Its smooth and tasty. No lingering hop, just a nice crisp and clean brew.","kmpitz2","May 14, 2005"

3.87,-1,3.5,4,4,3,4,"A pretty good DIPA - tends more towards IPA than DIPA I think. Not best in class, but the best Breck beer I've ever had. I usually like grapefruity notes in IPAs rather than the apricot - personal preference that docked it a little in my book. It reminded me somewhat of Great Divide's Titan IPA , but not quite as good from what I remember.","Beaver13","Apr 20, 2005"
3.5,-10.5,4,4,3.5,3,3,"The beer pours a nice dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an earthy pale and crystal malt scent with a nice citrus hop aroma. It is bitter with a musty odor. The taste is decent. It has a tame pale and light crystal malt flavor that goes down slow and finishes musty and slightly warm. It is sweet with an earthy, bitter edge. I don't really care for the flavor that much. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an average double IPA at best. It needs new yeast and better conditioning. Also, the malt bill could use a tuneup.","WesWes","Beers"
4.05,3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"22 oz bottle pours a clear orange amber with a nice creamy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass.Typical hoppy citrus and pine aromas, fresh pineapple, grapefruit and caramel flavors. Full bodied with a soft and thick mouthfeel, not syrupy like some of this style, finishes dry and bitter, It is hard to believe this is 9.2%. I will say this is the best I have had from this brewery thus far.","maxpower","0"
