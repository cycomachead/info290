"I had 4.20.15 for this one"
""
"had the Pie 3/14/15 and 4/20/15. both excellent beers. very fresh"
"It's a beautiful tasty beverage! Get it while you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber, smells boozy with notes of grapefruit, citrus, sweet malts and hops.  Tastes of dank bitter hops, and an aftertaste that hints back at the sweet citrus and bread.  The hops are the defining characteristic.  This is a bold IPA to be sure.  Really an awesome imperial that lives up to the hype.  I'll be looking for another sixer of this at the next release."
""
""
"O (4.5) - I'd never had this one, and wasn't necessarily going to buy it.  But I got a bomber of it . . . Wow!  I'm really glad I did.  I really don't have many complaints.  Good drinkable beer with great flavor.  I will buy more."
""
"Overall- Keyword here is fresh! The flavor profile goes through fast, from malt tones to bitter finish. Freshness definitely adds to the smoothness of this beer. Easy drinking, and the abv is well hidden. Great concept by Stone, and the quality is more than there. Excellent 2x!"

"Absolutely amazing. Hop forward is an understatement. Amazing mouthfeel. Like a little citrus fairy couple dancing on my tongue!"

"*not ferment, but yes, foment.  This beer makes me salty."
""
""

"2x IPA lover here -- this beer OVERRATED.  After just having enjoyed a KBS and the pure enjoyment and understanding of such a finely crafted brew, I don't have any idea why folks are doing backflips over Enjoy By.  Average all the way around... where's the taste distinction, brewmaster character, special note/feel/taste?!"
""
"Overall – I like this dank IPA, but that is what I go for in IPAs. It is a hit it and quit it release."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of hype and expensive, so you would expect the very best.  Well its not the very best but its darn good.  Enjoyable would be an understatement.  This is a very fresh beer and I like it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Also, this is way better than their old DIPA, Ruination."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I always enjoy an Enjoy By.  4.25 paws."

"In my opinion, this is about as good as an IPA can be (among the very best I've had to date). If you don't love strong and fresh hoppiness, don't get this.  It is perfectly balanced hoppy deliciousness!  I recently acquired a case of the 4-20-15 and I can't wipe the smile off my face.  This beer is a grand slam!"
""
"What a delight to find on tap.  This is a great example of what an IPA can be."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer makes me happy"
""
"Potent aroma of citric, floral and grassy hops. Taste is so fresh like the hops are still floating in the beer. Bitter but not lingering bitterness on the tongue. This beer is smooth as it it but especially for a beer over 9%abv. Loved it and so did the people who shared it with me!"
""
""
"I don't know how to feel about this beer. I really like the smell, nice floral notes and a little bit of sweet stone fruit. I like the taste but I expected a little bit more punch from something that says devastatingly dank on the bottle. That being said it is very drinkable and has strong citrus flavors which build up as you drink. Another solid offering from Stone."
"4.20.15 version. One of the best double IPAs out there."
"This is the 4/20/15 enjoy by!"
"Enjoy By 4.20.15 expensive but very good."
""
"4/20 this one is so good"
"Freshness really does make a difference ! There is a vibrancy to this beer that the freshness brings.  And the 9.4 ABV ? Oh Yeah ! These folks at Stone Brewing are a bunch of mad scientists that """get it """ .  If you are looking for the living embodiment of the phrase """respect beer, look at this one."
""
"Love the flavor, aroma and feel.  Outstanding!"
"About 2 weeks after bottling and it's amazing.  Smell is fantastic - floral and citrusy.  Very smooth and clean.  Surprised it's such a high alcohol content.  Best DIPA I've had so far."

"It's a pretty good West Coast IPA, very Danky and has a nice clear look with a good head of foam. The citrus flavor is really there. Bottled 3-15-15 about 2 weeks out from today."
"This has to be my favorite IPA!!!!!  Tried 2.14.15 for the first time when my friend shipped it to me from San Diego to Chicago (we like to trade beers).  Picked up 4.20.15, and this IPA didn't let me down at all.  After pouring into my glass, I noticed many good floral notes right away.  Had a really nice, thick head on the beer, with a really nice amber color.  The taste was really great as well.  Pick up a really nice hoppy taste, as well as a nice citus grapefruit taste.  Wasn't very bitter at all.  With it being 9.4% alcohol, was very surprised at how smooth this beer is.  Myself and my friends are now huge fans of this beer!!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've truly never tasted a beer this fresh and flavorful. Incredible"
""
""
"Amazingly beautiful gold color with a solid grapefruit nose. Obviously dry hopped with motueka, one of my favorite hops. It was more resinous out of a bottle but on tap it was silky. You don't get the bitter until 3 seconds after your sip. What a solid beer. Wish this was on tap all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer! So tasty! This is """Enjoy by 4/30/15""". I know they vary a little but this particular one was NICE!"

""
"I am not enjoying this beer, but I don't know why"
""
""
""
"Delicious but has a strong alcohol taste. Probably the best smelling beer I've ever had. Thick, highly carbonated mouth feel."
""
"This beer was very smooth for an IPA... Can really taste the hops but definitely isn't over powering and taste fresh as all of Stone """Enjoy By""" beers."
""
""
""
"Had the enjoy by 4.20.15 at Salty Pig.  Love this concept.  Beer is a typical big California IPA, but it is the freshness that stands out.  Such a great beer.  However if I had this on April 21st, I would never drink beer again, and curse Stone"
""
"On tap, at The Blue Monkey"
""
""
""
""
"I had the Enjoy By 4.20.15 about 2 weeks after it was bottled - WOW...what an amazing beer. Amazing west coast IPA smell: danky, piney and fruity. A very pungent aroma that leaps out of the glass. The taste lives up to the smell- a perfect balance of dank, tropical fruit and pine needles. There is a gumminess on the aftertaste that, along with the grapefruit, pushes the bitterness away. The only knock I had was that it's just a little boozy on the back end. I can't wait to try the next Enjoy By."
"Great IPA for an IPA hater."
""
"Wow.. Just pored a stone enjoy by 4.20.15. and it was world class.  Nice color and lace and small head.. But enjoyed it throughly.. Gona get me some more!!!"
"This is fantastic.  It smells and tastes spectacular.  I can't wait for the next release and hope it's dist'd to Illinois."
"Honey colored with light head. Truly dank hoppiness with a little sweetness at the end of the nose. Well balanced and easy drinking for a DIPA . Didn't punch me in the palate like I had expected"
""
""
""
""
"4.20.15. Very good. Right on point with its price equivalents/ peers, sculpin and 90 min. I enjoyed it from a 6 and looking forward to the rest by 4/20."
"4.20.15 great hop aroma with very smooth finish"
""
""
"Clear straw with an orange hue and a huge white head. Pine resin, some citrus and a smack of mango in the aroma, which also carry over to the taste.  Decently bitter -- but not as devastatingly dank as one might hope.  A slight creaminess to the mouthfeel, and a small but noticeable alcohol punch.  This is a good beer, but the bar for great DIPAs is so high these days, it just doesn't measure up."
""
""
"O-  Good DIPA, definitely some good shit!"
""
""
""
"F: The mouthfeel is fuller than it looks.  There is a sticky feel to the beer as well as a little burn."
""
""
""
""
""
"Seriously bitter hop head delight.  Great floral  aroma.  West coast, hop centric piney flavor with no sweetness to get in the way of the hops.  Lingering citrus-rind bitterness."
""
""
"Enjoy By 4.20.15.  This thing smells as close to perfection as I'm allowed to believe is possible."
""
"Super dank on the nose. Bitter on the back. Overall great for hop heads."
""
""
""
""
"haven't rated any of the previous ones, but I love this beer every time. mmmm."
"Real bitter, dank and great, if you enjoy big in your face IPA's you will probably love it.  Arguably the best beer I've ever had."
"There is great hop bombadiering on the taste. By far , flavor is the best characteristics of this beer.  A lot of pellety flavor though. My take is enjoy by 420 would have been even better fresh.  ENJOY since sister beer would be what I'd want to try."
"4:20 version.  I can tolerate the dank, onion, garlic, sweaty feet aroma.  I just felt it was overly bitter and the hop profile was unable to effectively balance this monster imho."
"Not worth all the hype"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an exceptional beer. When it comes to Stone's best, this is on par with Ruination, perhaps better. Without going too in-depth, I love the mix of tropical fruits and oniony, peppery, spicy characteristics. It did wonders to the palate, and it had me hoping for a limited edition bottle that includes a tongue scraper. Dank, delectable, and overall delicious. Like Daniel LaRusso and Ally with an """I", Stone and hops are a winning combination. Enjoy."
""
""
"Cmon the only thing that's going to be devastated is your dad when you tell him you're gay for IPA"
""
"Enjoy by 4.20.15 in 12oz. bottles. Delicious!"
""
"Great beer!"
"Awesome!  My review is I just enjoyed this at Bigbys Pour House in Rolling Meadows, IL on tap and it was better than in the bottle."
""
"4/20 edition...Man, so good. They've all been good...to me, they take a couple weeks to hit peak flavor, but this one is great out of the gate. 6 packs?!?! One happy dude."
"Aroma is amazing. Very Hoppy, fresh, and straight up dank.  Mouth follows with even fresher tasting hops and crisp delicious bomb. One of my favorite beers ever."
""
""
""
""
"I have had too many bad ones of the enjoy by's to give them any better of a rating."
""

""
""
"First sip 2/13/15 at home with John. Purchased at Whole Foods February 2015. Enjoy by 2/14/15."
"Great looking beer and the smell is like a bunch of IPA's rolled into one. I'm getting tropical fruits, berries, flowery a bit of that onion and grassy smell.  NIce bite up front evolving into a slightly boozy, big hop bomb. Every smell is in the flavor leaving that tongue scrubbing bitterness and some warmth from the 9.4. I love how Stone has no reservations and just serves up a huge double IPA with a take no prisoners attitude. Not for a person that just wants to have session beers. This ones huge!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.14.15 very hoppy yet well rounded and refreshing even"
"Hop heads delight, as it says on the bottle it is devistingly dank. Almost a palette wrecker"
""
"12 oz bottle, 420 enjoy by. Not as good as previous enjoy by's. Lacking a little in taste and a bit boozier than I remember. Still, a very good beer."
""
""
""
"The initial smell is great, hoppy, floral, etc. I was so excited after smelling the bottle that I was severely disappointed by the taste. There are some good hop flavors but nothing to impressive compared to other Enjoy By. Then again, every enjoy by is different so I understand that it is hard to compare. This IPA was very boozy in my opinion and lacked the flavor of other IPAs with less alcohol and less price. Maybe my bottle was exposed to light/sun light or left in a heated area for a while. Overall, still a good beer just not worth $7.99...."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this IPA, it has a real smooth taste even though it has a 9.4% alc/vol it is the 4/20 version. Will definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great fresh ipa! Stone is the bomb!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a really nice IPA. It was very well balanced with a nice floral nose and good bitterness on the backend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will definitely try the next one a little sooner.  Drinking the Enjoy By 3/14/15 on 3/12... Still a great beer but could be better. bit of an aftertaste that I can't quite put my finger on. great feel and aroma."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"This one was an Enjoy by Pi Day.  It i s an brilliantly clear golden color with a tremendous, towering white head.  Aroma is of fresh hops.  Flowers...pine, citrus peel.  Wet earth and woods.  The taste is intense.  Alcohol warmth...sweet malt, and lots...lots... of hop flavor and bitterness.  Spicy, peppery, resiny, citric, piney hops.  Full in body.  Intense and in your face.  Excellent."
""
"can not believe this has such high ratings! This was GROSS! I would have to be wasted to drink any more! Bitter strong, horrible after taste. Not smooth!!"
""
""
""
"Outstanding. One of my favorite IPA's. Usually get when available"
""
""
"Well balanced throughout, not bitter, nice floral notes."

"O: if you like grapefruit, this is your beer;"
""
"Overall, a very good IPA."
""
"Awesome idea, fresh delicious ipa with plenty of fruits and pine."
""
""
"The 4 .20.15 is better than the 3.14.15 smell citrus light floral taste like citrus but not over powerful this batch is great"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle, Enjoy by date 3.14.15, pour golden amber with 2in head. Nice lacing while drinking.  Smell of citrusy, grapefruit, pineapple and slight banana.  Taste was grassy, citrus, slight banana some sweetness very quickly then long hop bitter finish.  Medium body.  Overall very easy and smooth, covers alcohol well for 9.4%."

"Had the 3-14-15 version and very much enjoyed it"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had to revise from a previous enjoy by date. I feel that every batch of this is different. This batch """pi""" was terrific. Well balanced. Juicy, little resin, grapefruit taste. I really enjoyed this batch."
"Can't wait for the 4/20/15 version!"
""
""
"Not my favorite of the series"
""
""
"Had the 3.14.15 batch after searching for it for months (happened to be right under my nose). Excellent brew."
""
"Enjoy By 3.14.15. Hops done right. I almost never go out of my way for any variant of an IPA, but the Enjoy By Series has become something of an exception. It's not the ultra-bitter kind of (D)IPA that you get elsewhere. Excellent citrus/floral notes come through the whole way and keeps you coming back for another one."
""
"While it varies a little from batch to batch, I always try to grab a bottle if it's on the shelf!  MMM"
"I had this beer around 1/26.  Very interesting and very enjoyable!  Although, the aroma and finish have a grassy, almost bandaid-like undertone.  It smells like Mosaic or Azzaca hops which have a hint of that aroma profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet and bitter citrus up front with some mango and grapefruit detected. It has a sticky sweet malt middle with a touch of caramel quickly giving way to resinous pine and thick herbal dankness. This is an excellent double IPA."
""
""
""
"Slightly peppery nose. Grassy like all good rogue beers. Very cloudy. Love'n it"
"Stone enjoy by 3/14/15. Haven't had an enjoy by yet, but have had other stone beers. As usual, an excellent brew from them!"
""
""
""
""
""

""

"This is a world class beer, nectar from the gods. Very smooth down the hatch with a very nice citrus after taste. I will buy as many as possible untill 3.14.15"
"Great overall IPA. Good every time I have it."
""
"3.14.15 is not very memorable. The 2.14.15 was better. Mediocrity at its best."
""
"(Updated: I had this beer again 8 days before the drink by date, the booziness was much more evident than the first two bottles I had. It was also much sweeter than my prior two sittings. I guess there is something to that freshness dating.)"
""
""
""
""
"A+ liked this beer, smooth"
""
"Had this beer on 2/15/15.  One day overdue and it showed.  Great but not spectacular.  I'll try again next year"
""
"I would really like to see a return to a more floral/tropical kind of thing that they had going on more in the early bottlings, and seem to have less of now, but that might just be my bias talking."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clean flavours too, with a focus on piny, resinous and more petrol-like hop notes. Some slightly solvent-like booze notes."
""
"Picked up the enjoy by 2/14/15 on the 12th while up in mass....great tasting beer...hopefully I can get my hands on pi"
""
"deli after hockey game really good!"
""
"So I'm having this a day late (2/15, not 2/15). The day doesn't seem to have ruined it. It pours a slightly cloudy orangey gold with a nice white head that leaves some small sticky lacing. It has lovely rich tropical fruit, citrus and floral hops aroma. The taste is restrained for a Stone IPA, but it is still a delicious and well-made beer. The hops flavors are not overwhelming, but blend together well and are supported by a sturdy and subtle malt backbone. Not too heavy on the palate and with just a little bitter bite on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the 02.14.15. Clear with a nice layer of head. Smell of juicy citrus with a taste to match. Unlike other citrusy/juicy ipas, this has a nice bite of hops towards the end. Great beer all around...always excited to try the enjoy by variety's."
"O - A nice pleasant taste.  Not extremely bitter and very refreshing."

"This one kills it every time.  And I ALWAYS make the deadline...If only I were so committed in my personal/academic/professional life."
""
""
""
""
"Very good, sttrong, pungent, sticky, floral, citra, roasted tobacco hidden alcohol brew."
""
""
""
"I've heard that it's always the same formula, but I have no knowledge of my own on this. Good beer, though I wasn't as crazy about it as some people were."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This review is based on the 2/15/15 bottle. Poured a two finger off white head in a snifter. A clear amber color with decent lacing. The smell of citrus lasted from smell to taste. I throughly enjoyed this beer, up there with DF 90 minute. I could easily drink several, thankfully the 9.4% ABV will remind me how many I can drink. Truly a delight."

"If my wife ordered this as a perfume, I would bang her clothes 2/14/15 appropriate"
"Maybe it me, but all Stone beers have a similar """tinge""" to them."
""
"Best. My favorite. Amazing. Punch u in the face hops!"
""

"Overall a nice double IPA, pineapple taste, dry finish, one of the best DIPA;s I have had."

"2-14-15- awesome! Loved it."
""
""
""
"Smell is pure pink grapefruit. Sweet, citrus, light, maybe a little saline. Taste is what I expect... Pink grapefruit. A touch of grain, and sugar. Sugar. Sugar. I taste pith, a bit of spice... Not as bitter as I expected or wanted... But that sweetness is wonderful."
""
""
"Extremely well made solid IPA. Surprisingly easy drinking. Awesome on tap.  Amazing marketing strategy but easily accomplished with such a great beer."
"T-is it Citra? Mosaic? Simcoe? One of those three comes out to play, I think it's Citra, but I am far from a connaisure. Great IIPA, very drinkable too bad it 'expires'! Highly recommend."
"Fantastic brew! Top of the line in terms of Double IPAs i have had."
"Hard to review a brew who's shelf life is so short. This review is for the 2/14/15 enjoy by date. Light golden color which is unusual for a double IPA, smelled a little bitter and piney, taste was quite good, less hoppy and lighter feel than expected for a double. Didn't linger long on the tongue. Deceptively light for a double, easy to drink."
"Enjoy By 02.14.15. It was excellent. I am not generally a fan of their IPA (or the Delicious IPA) but this was fantastic and would drink again and again."
"Not my style, too much bitterness"
"Yum tasty delish awesome aromatic fresh nice fulfilling  an absolute treat"
""
"This was pretty darn good and fresh tasting.  If I'm being honest with myself I like the Ruination better as crazy as that sounds."

"This review is for the 02-14-15 batch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was a bit past the date so got it cheaply.  Solid anyway.  I will be visiting this beer again."
""
""
"Another excellent batch by Stone, this one being the 2.14.15.  I'd have to agree with another reviewer, the 12.26.14 and a couple others were better, the first one I tasted being so good I described it in terms that I wont repeat in public.  This one looks great, clear gold, white head, beautiful herbal and citrus aroma, strong herbal taste with citrus undertones, and near palate wrecker carbonation and flavor."
""
""
""
""
"3.14.15 Pi edition.  Excellent as always.  This version seemed a bit more harsh, more piney than the last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Draft of EB 2/14/15 @ The Office on 1/23/15.  Pours straw yellow with 1 finger of white head with good retention and lacing.  Aroma is strongly citrus with subtle tropical fruits.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit sticky.  Palate is robustly citrus and resinous hops balanced nicely against the malt backbone and alcohol.  Nicely balanced DIPA.  Probably the best Enjoy By since the 4/20/14."
""
""
"Great look. Great head with very good lacing. The nose on it was a little under par for me, but that's only because everything else about this beer was done well. Very good hoppy flavor. A very solid IPA."
"02.14.15 version. Outstanding as always. I live in Pa so bought a case. This is the 4th bottle and by far the best."
""
"Not the biggest fan of IPA's but hot DAAAMN this was solid.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again."

"I am a bit confused as to why I didn't like this one more."

"Stone Enjoy By 02.14.15 IPA.  My first time seeing Enjoy Boy in a bottle (22oz).  Served cold in a curved """porter/stout""" glass.  Beer is crystal clear and medium pale amber in color.  Surprisingly tropical aroma, and fresh, of course.  Courtesy of Citra, perhaps?  Flavor is moderately juicy, builds pine, resiny flavors on top of the tropical fruit/passion/mango notes promised in the nose.  Surprisingly well balanced for a Stone double IPA, too.  I would even say the finish is not totally dry.  The headiness of this brew, along with the corresponding amount of residual sugar, are the only things holding back this otherwise supremely drinkable IPA."
""
""
"This is always fantastic. Nose and taste are very hop forward with a strong piney, flowery presence. Body is light, carbonation is active. I always grab two or three of these when they become available, totally worth it."
""
""
""
""
"O – When I think of the quintessential American Double IPA, this is basically what I’m thinking of.  Huge hop bouquet and flavor with strong hop bitterness, and the malt body to hold it all up.  Excellent."
""
""
""
"Enjoy by 2/15/15 release. Pours straw crystal clear yellow. Slight carbonation. Thick head with lots of foam. Excellent lacing retention. Aromas of pine trees and musk. Lemongrass. Good mouthfeel. Lots of citrus tastes. Nose is all pine and grapefruit. Astringent bitter notes. Mid-palate it breaks to lemons, grapefruit, and some coriander spice. Back palate is a slight cinnamon bread malt and some bitter lemon notes. Lots of grapefruit and a slight alcohol bite. Excellent. Crisp, clean aftertaste. Some more bitter grapefruit and lemongrass. A hint of pepper and spice. 4.5 out of 5. Excellent."
"Enjoyed 12-26-14 immensely.  It was odd to drink a hoppy IPA that smooth and without bite.   2-20-15 is also good but I unfortunately agree with the onion comments."
""
"(Enjoy by 2/14/15) 22oz bottle poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a clear golden color (lighter than I would have expected), two finger head, noticeable carbonation bubbles. Resilient lacing. Inviting classic citrus IPA scent. Crisp, medium-bodied feel with a little bite from the carbonation.  Wonderful hoppy taste but not overly bitter, has some malt backbone that gives some balance. But still very hop-centric. Overall, fantastic. (9.5)"
""
"Yet another amazing enjoy by IPA by Stone"
""
"I like what they did with this beer. The marketing on this beer is different but awesome! It really brings people to by this beer just because of just the label itself! Good buy."
""
""
"Overall - An incredible beer. You can really taste the freshness. I love beers that taste pure (no chemical wank, etc.). This is probably the one of the most """pure""" tasting beers I have ever had. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Everytime one comes out I am Buying!  Great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
"Amazing IPA. Pair with pungent foods"
"Pours a beautifully, deep golden hue with extremely good clarity.  White, fluffy head with excellent lacing.  First thing you notice about this DIPA is it's wonderful fruity, floral aroma.  Very interesting flavor that transitions from malt to hop bittering with the PERFECT balance leaving no unwanted aftertaste; it even provides a deep earthy note toward the end that is very nice.  The carbonation is just so so to provide a great mouthfeel.  Interest lay enough, it is 9.2 ABV without tasting boozy.  Drinks like a session, so be careful. Nothing bad I can say, except with I would've bought more!"
""
"has shifted the bar on how i rate Imperial IPA's!"

"Insanely drinkable, with a very fresh taste and aroma. Wish I could hold onto some until summer, it would be a perfect afternoon porch sipper. Can't wait to sample future batches!"
"Freshness is key with this series.  Everything is extremely clean and distinct, no harsh transitions or unwanted lingering.  A bit too much onion for me (score dropped a bit) but otherwise excellent."
""
"Would love this in a growler."

"The freshness certainly brings out the best qualities of the style but the flavor profile doesn't stand out from most IPAs, you get your normal grapefruit and pine and other hop-forward flavors but nothing special."

"Very good IPA right here. Poured vigorously into a Palm tulip with a 3 finger head bursting with the aroma of grapefruit and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very full and filled with complexities reminiscent of grapefruit and florals. The alcohol isn't hidden but is subtle enough to be quite enjoyable. The lacing remains for the entirety of the glass and remains until completion. I will be purchasing another bottle of this before the 'expiration' date."
"A very good beer from Stone. I hope the future Enjoy By beers live up to this one."
"Enjoy by 2/14/15. Excellent. One of the best I've had in this series. Dank, a bit tropical, and oh-so-drinkable."
""
"Had the 2/14/15 last night and it tasted great! it had been a year or more since I last had it and it was better than I remember!"
"My favorite. Always clean, fresh, crisp and delicious. Well this or Hop Stoopid. Either will do. 2/14/15 batch. Excellent. $7.99 in Las Vegas."
"I love this beer but something is wrong with the 2/14/15 batch.  Finish is like cat pee mixed with overly astringent booze finish.  I never thought I would have to pour out the second half of an Enjoy By bomber, but that's what just happened.  Currently drinking a dank imperial stout, but even that isn't killing the taste of this funk.  Hopefully this is just a bad batch.  I am going to have to return these other two bombers."

I got strong guava flavors which is unique along other tropical flavors like pineapple and mango with fantastic bitter grapefruit citrus flavors to compliment. Nicely balanced with the malt but definitely hop heavy (which is my preference) I just don't want to stop drinking this beer. Better than Pliney in my opinion in smell taste and mouthfeel. If you see this beer, get it, and drink it fresh!"

"Ok, drinking this Enjoy By 12/26/14 on 12/26/14. This bottle was found at a Trader Joes in VA. This beer pours creamy golden, mostly clear with a very nice thick head and decent lacing clinging to the sides for dear life. Aroma is amazing with pineapple hitting the nose first, followed by hoppy, piney resin and other tropical and domestic citrus. Flavor hits sweet at first just for a second and then lets loose with all of the varieties of hops in an explosion !!. Pineapple and orangesicle dominates the citrus flavors and the hops provide a surprisingly balanced beer( There are many, many different varieties of hops in this one). Beer feels good and sticky going down and bitterness lingers on, but not too much. Carbonation is right and you can definitely tell this is a fresh beer. Good Job, Stone !!"

"Enjoy by 12. 26.14.   Been sought after for a few months now after trying most of stones regular releases and reading more and more about this one. Finally found one available in my home town (without an expired date! Chill bumps upon noticing in the cooler!) although if I find another tomorrow( as today on Christmas the store is closed) ,  I will buy another and drink right before i CANT enjoy by!! have very high hopes and I can say..... This beer is magnificent! Beer is an understatement.  From the smell to the Taste this fills all the gaps that other iPas lack, and I didn't even know they were lacking until I endured this HOP /FLAVOR  explosion.I wouldn't even say it is bitter like most iPas as the bitterness is full flavor until it completely fades from your taste buds. It has completely ruined my palate as I have read from others.. This beer sets the bar for all iPas for me at this point. And with an abv in the 9's I'm blown away more like 6's by taste. If u drink iPas regularly do not pass this up you will not regret it!! Can't wait to find another!! Cheers, Kevin."
"O: Just snuck this one before it's enjoy by date, but still a very potent and very tasty brew."
"The 12-26-14 seems more piney and less bready than the 4-20-14, which was the last Enjoy By I had. Was not crazy about the 4-20, but this one--the 12/26--is a flat-out solid DIPA."

"Dam before I even went to smell this beer the citrus popped me in the nose.  Beer pours a lite copper in color the head quickly disappears and is off white in color. The beer smells delicious, one of the best smelling IPA's my nose has had the pleasure of meeting. IT reminds me of frolicking, through the citrus grooves of California. I have never done that but that's probably what frolicking is like. The flavor comes off as a caramel sweet orange with some tropical fruit flavors. The beer isn't a display of hoppy bitterness tearing at your enamel as much as it is a display of the softer more  sensitive floral flavor and aroma of the hop."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma of green fresh hoppy notes with light sweet notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by floral green hoppy notes with grassy notes and residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Glad to finally try this and it is indeed very enjoyable."

"This is an impressive brew. Golden orange liquid topped by a clean white head that is large and slow to leave. When it does it leaves quite a bit of evidence of its presence. Nose has an abundance of tropical fruits and light sweet malty goodness. The two pair to create an olfactory delight . Taste builds from there. Hops hops everywhere and just enough malt to ride. While big and pervasive they are not a grapefruit bomb. Multilayered and multifaceted they display an attention to the smallest detail. The tropical side is dominant when colder with the lovely citrus showing its yellow skinned dry and puckering edge as it warms. In all cases the abv is a """Say What?""". You can pound this brew and not know it until you wake up on the floor. Feel is medium heavy with a full creamy carbonation the enhances the overall quenching quality. It just drinks like a session ale. A superb beer in all aspects. I love the attention to the hop construct that drives a brewers vision to create something like this."
"Overall: this is quite a good beer.  Something about the composition of the hops isn't my favorite, but the freshness and craft quality cannot be disputed.  Kudos on that."

"An interesting IPA for the holidays"
"Slightly thick off white head. Light gold in color.  Floral and citrus dominates the nose with great pine notes. Tastes just as good as it smells. Lots of fruity hops and pine. Definitely one of my favorite IPAs that I have tasted."
"One of, if not my favorite double IPA right now."
"This 3/14/15 is as good as the 2/14/15 Enjoy By IPA. At 9.2% doesn't feel heavy and overly malty at all! The citrus is still well pronounced and balanced ! Love the Enjoy Bys :) freshness is the key with these IPAs and Stone does an incredible job keeping it fresh :) cheers"
"Overall: Fantastic beer, and a must try for anyone who likes hops that impart flavors like apricot, tangerine, and tropical fruits along with just a touch of vegetal dankness. Awesome."
"Bomber poured into a tulip. Bottle best consumed before Boxing Day. No obstacles there. Dark yellow amber with a finger and a half of creamy, slightly frothy off-white head. On the light side visually speaking. Aroma dominated by tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit), tangerine, lemon, and peaches, with a subtle pine undercurrent. There is more pine on the palate (along with a decent blast of booze), with the nose skewing fruitier, although I am still getting copious quantities of tropical nectar and peach. Slight hint of onion. Very light malts, just a tinge of toffee. Comes off as well-attenuated, with little to conceal the generous hop bill. Somewhat woody and herbal on the back end but lacks the potent green notes one can get in less refined fresh hop ales. Less body than expected for such a """big""" beer, dare I say on the light side, with just the right amount of mid-range fizz. I am temped to deem this Go To IPA's big brother, although that comparison does not quite capture the nuances. Suffice to say, this is a powerful brew yet somehow sophisticated in its lack of coarse bitter notes or green off-flavors. Nothing but tropical muskiness, citrus rind, and pleasant floral alcohols to nourish the beer geek soul."

"No gimmicks here, drink by the posted date and your taste buds will be rewarded."

"Overall, this was a better version of the Enjoy by. I have had this before previously, but this batch had a much greater emphasis on the tropical fruits, which I enjoyed. The only downside is that the beer wasn’t all that balanced. It definitely hit with the hop bitterness, but it didn’t have enough malt backbone to make it more well-balanced. I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be an IPA, but it needs a tad bit more malt to up the complexity and overall balance. I would rate this a 90/100."

"Overall: A great beer.  I finished the second half of the bottle during the second half of the 1 PM games and into the 4 PM games...  Definitely felt the alcohol at that point.  Great beer."
"Pours slightly hazy golden color with 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention is good.  Lacing is quite good.  Deep fresh, citrus aroma.  Very appealing.  Nice hop forward bitterness, piney, with a slight citrus maltiness and great fresh, bitter, resin aftertaste.  Slightly soapy and astringent.  Very good and fresh beer."
"Overall: What I dream for in a Double IPA. The citrus comes through from the aroma all the way to the finish. i look forward to the next chapter in the enjoy by series."

"Enjoy By 12.26.14, Clear golden-amber pour with a foamy white two finger head with good retention and great lacing.  Sticky, resiny hops dominate the nose along with hints of grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, orange peel, and subtle green onion.  The taste mirrors the nose with dank, resiny, earthy, fresh picked hops along with hints of pine, orange peel, grapefruit, tropical fruit, green onions, and just enough sweet caramel malt to keep it honest.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, subtly chewy, and extremely oily with a mouth-puckering crisp, dry, bitter finish.  Overall, I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for quite a while, and it did not disappoint.  Incredibly fresh and bold and every bit as good as Heady or Pliny!  Highly recommended!"
"Overall: Plenty of good hop notes with balancing malt sweetness, but some off key vegetal tones detract a bit."
""
""
"O: My best advice I can give on this beer is fuck the reviews and just buy it. I've had roughly 6-7 different batches of this, the first time I had it the beer was a citrus explosion juicy and delicious, the next 5 times it had an over powering onion taste that really turned me off. I had about given up on it but then I decided why not. Now it's herbally which is much more pleasant than the onion but I can't seem to get any consistency out of this beer which in my opinion makes for an average beer. However as you can see just buy the damn thing and form your own opinion on this one."

"Fortunately for me it's not a heavy, bitter, and alcoholic double IPA. It's actually golden in color, and it's got a medium-full body with a moderate carbonation (kind of English in character). The malt is pleasantly straightforward and just lightly sweet and subtly biscuity and caramelish. Nor is it overtly bitter. Don't get me wrong, it's got bitterness to it, but it's not that harsh and raspy bitterness you sometimes get. What I was in the mood for, and probably what really swayed me towards opening it tonight, was hops - and it's got 'em, but again, I was surprised, I thought I'd find it drenched in resinous, piney, and citrusy hops but it's actually quite smooth and refined. All of those attributes are present but they're not """in your face", even in the aroma. It's also a bit minty, softly grassy, earthy, and gently leafy or tea-like, but the mildly citrus pith and gentle tropical fruit are what really define it in the flavor. It's really rounded and supple, leaving it remarkably drinkable for the style. The one thing that reminds you that it is a double IPA is the alcohol which peeks out here and there, especially as you progress through the serving. Still, this is one dangerously drinkable beast."
""
""
"Very good looking beer when poured into the glass but the aroma was a bit weak considering this is a Stone IPA.  Decent hops taste but nothing overly special, but what really turned me off was the soapy like aftertaste this beer leaves behind. Looking back for an extra dollar I could have bought a six pack of some other IPA that's better or at least just as good.  I personally am getting a bit tired of companies thinking that just cause they put their beer in bombers makes it priceless when they don't make the beer itself worthy."
"A DIPA that absolutely gets it right.  Too many just don't have strong enough hop flavors and the malt ends up taking over, making them more like a hoppy barleywine.   Enjoy By brings the huge, dank hop smells and flavors that unmistakably put this in IPA territory.   Also appreciate the novel way to focus unavoidably on freshness through the prominent date on the bottle."
"O: Try this beer if you love fresh hopped ales I thought it was delicious and I don't usually go for high % beers."

"Color clear gold with a thick white head.   Nice sticky lacing.  Nose is grapefruit, pine, and herbal hops.  Just a touch of sweet malt.  Flavor is very hop forward on the palate.  Lots of resinous hops and tropical fruit.  Finish is long and bitter hops.  Medium body with a lot of hop oiliness.  A very delicious DIPA that I've had before and will definitely be having again."

"12.26.14 WTF???????????????????? This version was awful. What did you guys do here? Grapefruit notes completely missing in the taste. No balance, just bitter. Totally off flavors. Would have gotten a zero if I had not liked the other versions. This current iteration was a miss."

"The obvious point about Enjoy By is that freshness matters. The more important thing to take away from this fantastic Double IPA, however, is that Stone cares about how their products are consumed - not just how they sell. No wonder everyone is """California Dreaming""" - they've tried the IPAs like this one and, most astonishingly, they don't have to pay too dearly for the experience."

"This is ranks up with the best DIPA's I have ever had. This is my second bottle, and I plan to get another couple if I can find them in the next week. The price is also quite reasonable, and for an ale that I would probably take over Permanent Funeral. It is well worth the price. This beer could not be made any better."

"First time trying an enjoy by. Poured into a pint glass. Very clear golden amber with about an inch of head. Smell is largley a strong pine with some subtle notes of citrus like grapefruit, lemon, and orange. The taste follows the nose very closely and has a more balanced taste between cirtusy and pine than the smell does. There is a pretty large malty backbone in it as well. Medium mouthfeel with a good hop smooth hop bite on the back end. This beer reminds me a lot of a more hoppy hopslam. Solid brew by stone once again, but a slightly above middle of the road IPA."

"Overall:  I hate giving a beer a perfect 5, and don't think I have ever done so thus far, but this could possibly be the best tasting beer I have ever tasted.  This is my first time trying this beer and I always thought of it as kind of gimmicky or more of a sarcastic marketing response to the beer nerd community.  More than anything though, this is a fantastically crafted, amazingly tasting Double IPA.  It has a huge burst of tropical hop flavor and is not overly bitter.  I could drink this all day!"

"Poured from 22oz boomer into tulip glass. 1finger fluffy head dissipates quickly. Golden, almost cloudy color. Smell: not much cold. A little alcohol and grapefruit as it warms.  Taste: apricot, peach, grapefruit at the end strong grapefruit finishing into bitter hops. Mouthfeel: smooth and fresh, not syrupy or sticky. Light crisp carbonation. Overall: terrific IPA, very we'll balanced and full of flavor.  wish there was a bit more complexity, but very enjoyable!"

"solid ipa, I overlook it bc its always available at my liquor stor (MAX BEV in weha) very bitter and delicious"
""

"The beer has a nice hazy orange appearance.  The carbonation bubbles are effervescent. It has a modest, but solid head and leaves a spotty lacing.  It has a very fresh aroma and nice earthy hop smell, with a sort of garlicky characteristic. The beer is interestingly complex with a ton of hop flavors: predominately resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange rind.  There is also a slight malt sweetness.  A terrific DIPA; one of the best examples out there."

"This brew struck the balance between a hefty, complex, flavor profile and an extremely refreshing and clean finishing experience. Both the aroma and flavor was, obviously, hoppy - citrus, floral, pine. It was all there. A very delicious beer. An adventure that I will seek to replicate for the rest of my life and most likely never will."

"I had a batch with the sell by date of 7/4/14, and consumed on June 22. Growler from keg at local beer-specific retailer. Good dense gold color, a little hazy, but normal for a DIPA. Good healthy one finger head which left slowly. Aroma is almost pure hops, with a backing of malty sweetness. A bit grassy in its hoppiness, along with pine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Taste is wonderful, full in your face hoppy bitter resinousness, backed by enough sweet malt to make it really drinkable. Again, a bit of green freshness in the hops, I'd compare it most to nopalitos or green agave, which accents the pine and grapefruit excellently. Finishes dry, hoppy, and leaving you wanting more. Great beer. My first in this series, but definitely not my last."

"A- pours a clear light copper hue. Small foamy head. S- mainly citrus with alcohol detectable at the end. T- floral sweetness that hits side of the tongues and lingers a tang of grapefruit. Malt slightly present at finish but is over whelmed by those beautiful bitter hops whilst being layered with a resinous sweetness. M- bright with medium body. O- though alcohol is evident in the aroma it's presence is hidden by the glorious hops. Quite enjoyable considering the decent ABV. Paired perfectly well with a baked macaroni and cheese casserole."

"Had one 6 weeks ago and saved one for 07-04-14. Used a Troegs HopBack glass because I couldn't find my Sam Adams or Dogfish glasses. Best beer I have had in a long time. Amazing nose... hoppy, citrus, resinous, other stuff going on. Bursting with flavor from the first sip BUT not so hoppy that it isn't balanced and refreshing. Would not think it was 9.4% ABV if it didn't say so on the bottle. Wish I had bought more than 2 bottles...."

"On tap at Sonka's Irish Pub, Terre Haute, IN. Poured a wonderfully deep burnished gold with a bit of decent head and some nice lacing. Huge deep malt sweetness in the nose with a wonderfully piney-citrusness. Same with the flavor, a huge malt sweetness with great caramel tones and a nice citrus start and pine end to the hop flavors. A bit thick and rough, but not bad for a 9+% brew. Excellent stuff."

If you want a hoppy double IPA that wont disappoint pick this one up soon. Only downfall with this brew is the relatively high price at over 8 dollars, so I had to reduce the overall score from 4.25. Keep making great beer Stone, cheers!"

"I can't say anything negative about this beer, so I had to give it a perfect rating. It's clean and crisp on the nose and the palate. Perfect IPA taste and smell. A beautiful golden, slightly orange color to it. I poured it into an IPA glass very slowly so there wasn't much head but it bubbled around the edges nicely and stayed the whole time I drank it. For a 9.4%, there's no alcohol taste so it really creeps up on you. Fantastic beer. Hoping to get another pint before 7/14/14"

""

""
""
""
"pours crystal clear, bright dark golden in color, bright white head. good head retention, and a bit of lacing. aroma has got to be the most intense hop aroma I've smelled from an IPA before. like opening up a package of vacuum sealed package of hops. citrus, pine, a bit dank. clean simple base malt and all hop flavor. highlights the hops well, but I personally prefer a bit more malt flavor in a DIPA. medium body, higher carbonation."

"Enjoyed in a 20 oz Beer Club Member glass at Mellow Mushroom in Southlake, TX. Pours a cloudy amber color with two finger head that slowly dissipates and 20 minutes later remains to create lacing. Lots of floral notes in the nose. The taste is surprisingly balanced - I was expecting my taste buds to get knocked around by the hops, but they survived. The alcohol is well hidden so be careful!"

"In fairness I never was much of a hops fan and this follows the Stone model of catering to that taste. Pine was the flavor of note but the lack of depth was striking. I applaud the effort, but no cigar."

"This is a killer IPA, stone really nailed it. One can argue that more citrus hops could amp up the complexity, but there is some citrus, and I prefer the resinous hop flavors. Light body, high, clean ABV, what's not to love?"
""
""
"I'm getting a lot of booze and onion in the taste. It reminds me of FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf and a better version of the regular Stone IPA. While very good, it just seems overrated and overpriced. I can find local IPA's that are more satisfying."

"Opened the bottle served with some nice chicken in a red pepper jelly over vermicelli. The golden color looks great. The aroma as I poured was intensely crisp with an abundance of pine. Once I dug into dinner and swallowed this lightly crisp, but very complex IPA I was blown away. This beer was promised as a fresh, but date driven determinator and it more than delivered an enjoyable experience. It's complexity isn't like the usual offerings in the IPA category. It offers something refreshingly different and makes me want to go get some more before July 4th."

"Pours a clear light amber with nice finger and a half of loosely bubbled head that is persistent and leaves a great lacing. Nose is grapefruit and most notable, tons of tropical fruit especially mango/papaya, maybe even some peach mixed in. Extremely fruity. Taste, unfortunately for me, follows the nose pretty close. I don't know the type of hops off hand but there's a hit of hoppy, piney bitterness and then another assault of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is what it should be, nothing to brag or gripe about. Overall, there's waaay too much of the tropical fruit sweetness for me. I just don't """enjoy""" it. I'll still buy the next one though because this series from Stone is generally one I enjoy."

"Enjoy by 9/20/14 is ridiculously floral. Nose, taste, such a clean and delicious offering from Stone. Solid IPA. Even the wife thought it was really good, and she hates IPAs. Update: The 12/26/14 was just a delicious mango explosion. 3/14/15 Pi was enjoyed with my pal Jens4212, I got the tulip. Beautiful golden amber pour with sticky-icky lacing. Hop explosion: orange, grapefruit, mango, bit of a savory/earthy hop. Not much alcohol noticeable in the mix of citrus, bitterness, and deliciousness. Clean finish. Enjoy by rocks."

"Just cracked the 7/4/14. Poured a nice pale yellow with a fizzy head that left trails down the side of the glass. The smell was amazing with a lot of hop scents of pine and citrus. The taste was great, exploding with a lot of pine and grapefruit notes that mingled in the mouth and left a very crisp finish that was very refreshing. Loved it and would definitely recommend grabbing a bottle while there is still time."

"O- A solid IPA. Well balanced and a decent hop bill. Will probably buy a bottle of each release as long as it is under $10"
""
"O- Another favorite DIPA of mine that can party with the top guys. Very drinkable and refreshing. The flavor of this really reminds me of Pliny, but with a stronger bite and bitterness. Wish this was a little more available, as this is the first time I've noticed in the area and there were purchasing restrictions. Highly recommended and kudos to Stone."
""
""
""
""
"O: I can feel the alcoholic warmth, was confused until I looked it up and saw that it is 9.4%... Hides the alcohol really well, hidden by the bitter pine finish. I was expecting this to be more in the 6-7% range, the value is much better as a high ABV beer. Not as in your face flavor as most IPAs that are this strong... Man this is a good beer. If you see it, grab it. There's a reason Stone is legendary for making IPAs."

"For my taste buds, this is a perfect DIPA and probably one of my favorites of all time. Super fresh and hoppy, very citrus forward, masks alcohol surprisingly (dangerously) well, very smooth. Importantly, no maltiness / sweetness which is sometimes a drawback of this style for my taste. If you're looking for a fresh, hoppy, big west coast IPA I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one."
""

""
""
""

"Cheers!"
"I'll keep this brief. A couple days ago had an 07.04.14...first thing i noticed was the (fantastic) sweet citrus smell. then I tried a taste...simply outstanding."
""
""
""
"Never had enjoy by until today 07 04 14. Impressed with the complexity of this beer. Will definitely seek this out again. Haven't tried in a bomber yet but on tap its amazing. Thank you Stone for all that you do and please continue to do it. peace out homies"
"One of my all time favorite Double IPAs! The first batch I bought was 04.20.14 and I absolutely loved it. Currently, I am drinking the 07.04.14 for this review. It pours wonderfully with a light bronze color and thick foamy head. My first inhale hit me with a dank citrus, pine scent with undertones of an earthy, fruity base. The beer itself is smooth and round with a crisp bite of citrus. Its fresh, bold and I love it!"

"This is one of God's own prototypes. Some kind of high powered mutant never even considered for mass production."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, a fantastic DIPA, but those """tongue turning""" flavors are a bit of a detractor. Still a fresh hoppy well crafted brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another winner from Stone. I poured this one (22 oz bottle) into a wine glass and let it warm to bring out the flavors. While I enjoy other IIPAs a bit more (e.g., Hopslam and Hoptimum) you simply cannot go wrong with this one as this one is rock solid. I will certainly be picking up another one in the next couple of days."
""
""
"Living by one of Stone's tap houses makes for very fresh Stone. The pour was crystal clear with a nice 1 inch head. Lacing was awesome as it stuck to the beer glass all the way down. Has a distinct piney flavor and scent. Overall an excellent brew, I drink it every time it's available."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice yellow beer. Nice head, tall and foamy. Smell varies depending on release, but mostly strong and hoppy. Taste is the same, bitter, strong, hoppy. Mouth feel is good, light beer. I can drink a few of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer. I think I enjoy the concept and push for fresh beer more than the beer itself. That said, it is very good, yet not something I would hord or seek out."
""
""
"Overall: I have yet to try PtE, the """big""" three Vermont beers, or some other highly rated IPAs/IIPAs, but this is certainly the best representation of the style I've had thus far. I had both the bomber and tap and although both were amazing, it was even that much better on tap. Stone beers tend to be past their prime by the time they get to my area, where the hops fade, leaving a malt and onion mess. But with this, I know each batch will be fresh. At just over a week since bottling, this is one of the freshest bottles I've ever had, and it shows. Enormous vibrant hop presence that I enjoy in an IPA without being too aggressive. We have a real winner here! Worth the $9 (with tax) price tag for a guaranteed fresh bomber of this quality brew. Can't recommend this one enough, and absolutely worth the hype. Enjoy!"
"Must be something wrong with my palate (some reaction to the type of hops they use), so don't judge the beer by my review."
""
"O- Kudos to Stone delivering this beer into the market as distant as VT within 1 week of its bottling. That is an immense testament to their commitment, enthusiasm and influence in the market to prove their point. I have now tasted various iterations of this beer at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and post 90 days...although it is a delicious offering at any time, I am now a convert of enjoying this as fresh as possible since the tropical fruit notes sing the loudest and blend the best with the herbal notes. Time will accentuate the garlic/onion qualities that are only muted as a young beer. (5.0)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: bravo stone. I always look forward to these. At first I thought this beer was lacking to its predecessors but as it opened up it became a clean citrus bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: How have I never had this beer before? I'm a hop head that lives walking distance from Stone Brewery and am ashamed to say I skipped over this beer for almost a year before finally deciding to try a bottle. This is without a doubt the best double IPA I've had and is sure to please any that consider themselves hop heads. STOP READING AND GO GET SOME"

"Absolutely delicious. I don't believe that an overall """perfect""" beer exists. But this is pretty close. Holds up to the Pliny the Elder everyone is so high on. In my opinion I'd take Enjoy By over the Pliny any day. The fact that it's dated makes it easy to know you're getting a freshly made batch. If you haven't tried Enjoy By you're missing out."

"It's a big beer, no doubt, and yet it manages to be so surprisingly drinkable at the same time. After a while, I can feel the 9.4% ABV, but to be honest until I'd drunk most of the bottle, I didn't really notice it. That's the sign of a really good (or at least really distracting) beer."
""
""
"I have had two versions of Enjoy By this year and they seem better than year's past. I had to go back and up my rating this year. Bold Citrus and fresh taste and is at the top of my IPA list. Definitely think it is better in growler/tap form if you can find it. Seeing more bottle this year here so it seems easier to get than in the past. I try to get it a least a couple times a year."
""

"Damn near the perfect IPA. I love the hoppy, citrus notes in this beer. It has a nice piney start and grapefruit finish. It is really a role model for IPAs.

"Overall: It was a big deal for Puerto Rico's craft beer scene getting this. Believe the hype, it's simply incredible in every aspect. Hophead or not, you need to give this beer a try. It should be noted that in order for this beer to be enjoyed fully it should be had slowly. The taste and texture both change the warmer it gets."
"An excellent and we'll balanced DIPA. A fresh and pleasant scent, hinting at fruit. It does not disappoint at first taste, exploding with heavy fruit, especially grapefruit, and plenty of upfront hops. A bit of maltiness helps balance the brew, and masks the alchohol. The perfect amount of bitterness on the finish. Very impressive, reminiscent of Bells HopSlam. My second bomber, and not my last."

"I poured this into a ipa glass, it has a golden color body with a small sticky head. The aroma has a pine and citrus coming from it. The taste has a bitter hop of pine up that's hits the tongue. I get a little citrus also. The mouthfeel is sticky and leaves a sticky hop taste on the tongue. Overall this is excellent dipa."

"As I brew more from home, I buy less and less beer - and appreciate more those beers that I am unlikely to be able to reproduce. The complexity and expense of the recipe used to create this ale, along with the assuredness of craft on display make me willing to part with $8 for a bomber without complaint. Far superior to Double Bastard in my opinion - one of Stone's best efforts to date - a pure and uncompromising example, in rare company in the style."
"O - """Devastatingly Dank""". Yes. Basically delivers on what is expected, and does so very well. I feel it is more hop-focused/forward/centric than other DIPAs, much to its own benefit."

"The Stone Enjoy by Series is, for me, becoming one of the best beer series ever. The most recent addition is the Enjoy by 4.20.14 and I think that it's the best one so far. It's very smooth and crisp IPA. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday in a growler and as soon as we were done 64oz he was asking me to go get him another one! My Dad is not a huge IPA guy so the fact that he liked this so much showed me how good this brew was/is, I was unable to operate a vehicle after a few of these due to the 9+ ABV. He said he'd try and go the next day."

"Taste: This is bitter, but smooth, hoppy as hell, but just wonderful. I detect pine, grapefruit and other citrus fruits. This is what an IPA should taste like people! I know I am using a lot of punctuation to describe this beer, but what have I been missing out on? I have drank a lot of IPA's and DIPA's as of late and this one is the best I have had. I have never given a perfect score on a beer and I don't know if there is such an animal but this one is about as close as I have ever given. I just hope it doesn't become as hard to find as some of those others, which by the way I have never been able to get my hands on. So, maybe those are 100 beers. This one, is really really close to being my all time favorite IPA though. One complaint, at 9.4% you can't drink but one."

"Medium amber color, aroma heavy with floral hops. The taste is just divine. The hops hit hard up front but then the side notes of citrus come in, a hint of lemon on top of peaches. The malt base is actually present and brings a nice balance. The aftertaste is pleasantly tart with returning hop features. Would I get this one again, absolutely!"

"The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than medium bodied, with good active carbonation, and a slightly sticky finish. This goes down just like a DIPA should, but maybe a touch too heavy for me. Overall, this is an excellent DIPA that I look to get every time it comes in the distribution area. I love the concept of the naming / labeling, and wish more dates were clear like this. The citrus and pine work together beautifully, and the nose is an absolute hop bomb. Definitely worth the hype."

"O - I haven't had an Enjoy By in a while, but damn this is good."

"O: As I mentioned with respect to the taste, this beer was not spectacular. Stone beers are overrated, but this one in particular is overrated. It is a good beer and there is no doubt about that. However, it probably is not worth the $8 since there are other IIPAs out there for less that are pretty much the same. The aroma was """fresh," but that was about the only attribute that sets this brew apart from others in the field."
"Finally decided to review this beer after many many bottles and a few on-tap. This stuff is good, like REALLY good. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher than it is really. This is a serious Imperial IPA. It tastes like one, smells like one, etc. Its probably a little sweeter and malty'er than any other double I have had, and I personally attribute that to the freshness. This months bottle, 04-20-2014 is probably the best one I've had. I'm sure that's just a coincidence... If you have not tried this offering from Stone, try it out ASAP. You probably are not going to find anything better anytime soon. There are few others out there that compete, but are not nearly as READILY AVAILABLE as Stone Enjoy By. Tastes absolutely fantastic straight from a bottle, but if you must, pour it into a glass and do all that looking and sniffing, then gulp it down all the same. Enjoy!"

"(Enjoy By 4/20/2014) Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Semi-cloudy copper-orange with frothy 1/2” head on the first pour. 2nd pour was clearer and head was thicker, about 1”. Smell is intense, pungent grapefruit citrus, pine resin. The alcohol scent is apparent behind these as well. Taste mostly follows nose; citrus and pine, with an earthy undertone. Malt is understated. Not as tongue-coating as I expected, although the hops are definitely front and center; finishes fairly clean, considering the style and ABV. Medium-to-full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall a very tasty, fresh DIPA."
""
"I have now enjoyed both the 4/20 and the 2/14 versions of the """Enjoy By""". I've like every Stone offering that I've tried, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy these. This is an imminently drinkable ale for this amount of alcohol. This had well rounded flavor and seemed to have less of the sweetness than the Lagunitas Undercover. (Which was also amazing) This featured a nice head, pleasant aroma, and smooth mouthfeel."

"Overall a terrific expansion on what Stone normally does with their regular IPA and definitely has a slightly more diverse bouquet.

"Enjoy by 4/20/14. Clear light amber, golden, pour with a very nice head and long retention lacing. Nose of sweet citrus (mango, orange) over a light grapefruit and earthy dankness background. Light medium bodied with a slick texture. Normally carbonated with no effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavors over a slight biscuit sweetness with a low level of bitterness. It begins with the sweet citrus flavors which are soon overpowered by the dank earthy hop components. While complex, the flavor is heavily """dankcentric""" - lol. On the smooth finish, you get a bit of biscuit sweetness flowing into the dankcentric vortex coupled with a nice residual alcohol tingle at the back of the throat. An exceptional beer that those which wonder what dank means should try."
"o: Really good for sure, but I've had quite a few DIPAs I like more in the last 6months or so."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a fantastic beer. Have had 3 or 4 of the Enjoy By series, and they all impress me. A perfect example of what an IPA should be, at least to me. I love them like this, big tropical fruit, with enough bitterness to know it's there."
""
"[I am copying these notes over from RateBeer ... it does not require as long of review. I tasted this some time ago so I can't add anything.]"
""
""
""
"A very exceptional IPA with a supremely fresh aroma and flavor. Not the best IPA ever, but in the higher class of IPAs for sure and provides a unique character beyond just the freshness. Drinks very easy for its strength."
""
"Overall this is one of of the best IPAs I have ever had, and the best Stone Enjoy By I have ever tried to date."
""

"Cheers all!"

"Overall, this is a big, in your face DIPA with nothing to hide. It may be the most savory IPA I've ever had. This is the first time that all those descriptors like onion, garlic and cat piss really resounded with me. There is some tropical sweetness to balance things out, but I think this is not quite my cup of tea. A great beer, but they could tone back the CTZ, Summit, or whatever's bringing the onion."
""
"The re-dankulous 4-20 batch. Pours a lovely, hazy golden orange. Smells fantastic: citrus rind, sweet tropical fruit, and heavy pine. Taste is so dank and bitter, you guys; hoppy with a light malty sweetness. Aftertaste is dry, crisp, and bitter. Chewy and smooth. Doesn't get much better than this."
""
""
""
"t - I have not had all the """trophy""" beers but I've had a bunch of them. and I would put this up at the very top. what enjoy does (similar to what makes heady different from all the rest of the IIPA's) is it throws in a healthy amount of dankness to add some depth to the usual pine and citrus thing. comes on bitter and dank on the front end, with citrus and pine notes behind it. has a floral and dry finish. enjoy does not """hide""" it's alcohol as well as a lot of beers which gives it a spicy alcohol burn that you may like or hate. finishes very dry. the only problem with enjoy is I feel obligated to drink as much of it as possible when you can get it around here. which can quickly lead to trouble :("
""
""
""
"O - Stone really does this beer right. Although I think it is best enjoyed on-tap, the bottle is one of the best to be had at the local package store. It does age quickly, so heed the advice on the label."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" One and done for me, I prefer my DIPAs to hide the alcohol better, Pliny the Elder, Lagunitas Sucks and Boneyard Hop Venom do it better. All that said It's a very good beer and if the other ones are not available I'd never turn this down"
""
""
"O: Really great DIPA. I can't find much of a flaw with it at all. If it was around all the time it would be a regular in my lineup. Highly recommended if you can find it. Stone does another great highly hopped beer."
""
""
""
""
"12-24-14 - Christmas Day"
""
""
""
"ENJOY!!!!"
""
"O: Solid. I had prepared myself to be disappointed given the hype but this is definitely worthy of the praise."
"O - When I picked up this offering for the first time, I'd never had a true blue IPA or DIPA. This opened my eyes, and so wins major points for its role. But the beer holds up to the high initial rating I gave it because it delivers on its promise. A big, bold hop celebration, to be drunk quickly but not forgotten. Well worth the price."
"O: Overall a good DIPA but seemed one dimensional with little malt presence. Also the green onion seemed like an off-flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am so disappointed I only bought one bottle. I actually looked at real estate in Escondido today in an effort to live closer to this brewery. Thanks Stone; this beer is awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This years offerings so far have taken a serious nose dive! Had the release for Feb and now the March. Bittering is much milder and seems to be off balance now. Flavor is still solid but it is missing the 'grapey' (nelson sauvin?)finish I thought made this beer so unique. Dank hops are much more noticeable in this version. Not sure what has happened to the recipe or if hops used are no longer cost effective but it is not the awesome hop head offering it once was in 2013. Too bad this was definitely one of my favorite readily available IPA's in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this tonight on-tap side-by-side with lunch from Maine. The lunch was sooo much better that it may influence my relatively low rating. This beer had a somewhat soapy taste and while there was a lot of hop bitterness up front, there wasn't too much balance. Also the smell was pretty run of the mill with some mediocre pine and citrus but nothing that really stood out. Maybe Stone advertising the freshness has led to this one being though of more highly than it should otherwise be. I will revisit in bottle form though."
""
""
"Pours a brass color with a foamy head. Looks good. Hop stink: resin, green onion, over-ripe fruit, guava BO. What a taste! DIPA with sweetness in check (I love that). Lots of oily hops on the palate. Citrus, tropical fruit, garlic chives, sap, resin. Bitterness is fully present, but very well-balanced. Well-hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, full, and a bit chewy. Not too heavy. This is about as close to perfect as a DIPA gets."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; unbelievable hoppy experience, and very drinkable."
""
"Fresh, and yet dank, in the same physical space - wow! A five-week enjoy-by window, is ballsy, is what it is, but it does make its point about freshness and point of origin and Stone's hubris just fine. I wonder what it would be like to be able to try each successive release of this - probably, like anything, one would just get bored of it. Or not - this is one tasty, tasty DIPA, the hops large and in charge, and the near 19 proof booze significantly less 'fresh' and in your face."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most unique beers I've ever had. First time writing a review because I wanted to make note to myself in the future that this was for the 04.20.14 variety of the Enjoy By series. Smell and appearance are both excellent. Taste is very unique and like no other IPA I've had before. They mean it when they say Devastatingly Dank."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""
""
"If you've had a west coast IPA, this one has everything you would expect, simply done to the highest level of quality. Without mincing words, this is the best west coast IPA I have ever had in a bottle. Nuff said."
""
""
""
""
""
"enjoy by 4-20-15- lot of tropical fruit aromas and great flavors."
"Enjoy by 4.20.14,  poured from a 750.  Pours a translucent light gold with one finger foam.  Highly floral aroma with bites of grapefruit.  Hop forward crispness with good balance and bitter hoppy finish finish, mild sweetness creates a hop/malt equilibrium.  I will eagerly await the next enjoy bye.... Note that I think this 4.20 back surpassed the 2.14 batch."
""
"I've been slacking on the previous releases of Enjoy By, and haven't had a chance to Enjoy since October 2013. Just got a hold of (4) 4.20.2014 and damn was it good! More than I expected from the last time I had it. I'd say my pallet is more accustom to IPA's now and this is why I rate this beer so high."

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, sweet malt, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hops oils, slight floral hops, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of grass. Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, good body, and decent complexity."
""
"Abv at 9.4% is well balanced. Perhaps a touch of bite on the initial taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: The best way to sum up this beer is that it is simply a well put together Double IPA. Also, I love the short shelf life, ensuring that if I can find one it will be fresh with 100% certainty. Hope Colorado gets more in the next round."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is super fresh and super hoppy. It's what most hop heads dream about every night as their perfect beer. It's actually not too expensive considering the amount of work that goes into getting a 1 month old or fresher beer from the brewery to the store shelves. I won't talk the beer up too much, so you can have your mind blown too."

"O: A good offering for the style."
"O- Very good, and certainly and upgrade over ruination."
"Super floral - even more so than the 4/20 release. Still delicious, but a little dryer than I remember."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well done DIPA, though not quite in my personal top tier."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is admittedly my first experience with a Stone Enjoy By xx/xx/xx IPA and it has absolutely changed the way I look at life. I've had good IPAs in the past, but never anything this fresh, this complex, this perfectly crafted. Stone Enjoy By, I feel, has ruined me... because now as soon as the next release is mentioned, I'm going to be flailing like a madman trying to get my hands on a bottle or two. I hate to sound too much like a fanboy, but this has honestly been an experience like no other."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer for a hop fan. Not the best DIPA, but definitely worth grabbing a bottle or two before the enjoy by date (after which, I assume, Stone's fairy god mother spell expires and the beer magically transforms into skunk Natty Light)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer guru at the Woodbridge, VA Wegmans recommended this and I'm not disappointed. Very fresh, very tasty. I drank the 4.20.14 on 3.22.14. They were near out. Pick it up if you can."
""
"O - I never thought a dIPA could be so refreshing, especially from Stone. Great beer, and feel that much luckier living so close to Escondido."
""
""
""
"O - Well played by Stone both on the Beer and the concept and marketing. I guess I was expecting something a little different it being so fresh but I don't even know what. Either way it's a very good beer. Drink up, Beerites."
""
""
"O: More pine and bright citrus raises this up above the bottled version."
""
""
"Overall - worth the hype, a great DIPA."
"Overall, again I'm blown away. Stone has raised the bar."
""
"Batch# - 02-14-15 (definitely tasted different - less malty sweet)"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll preface this with the fact that 4.20.14 is slightly different than other Enjoy Bys, but that said, it still stays true to the original recipe. It's more dank than usual, yet you're still looking at the same overwhelming hop aroma and flavors bombarding you throughout (in a great way)."
""
""
"O - This offering by Stone is unbelievable. It's almost good enough to curb my mourning for the lack of Pliny here in WA."
""
""
"Overall just a fantastic beer. When fresh it is borderline sensory overload. Love this stuff. It probably helps that Nelson and Galaxy are two of my favorite hops."
""
"O- Very impressive from the full sensory overload to the nose, to the crisp bitter taste."
"I am looking forward to another one of these."

"O- As usual, an extremely well crafted beer by Stone. The aroma was an incredible blast of sweet citrus that didn't hint, in the least, the hop bitterness that was about to punch you in the face. Very nice."
""
""
"O - Excellent DIPA. I'm glad I was able to find this one while out and about at my local beer store. This one is definitely for beer lovers who enjoy the bitterness that hops bring to the table. I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next installment."

"Enjoy by 2/14/14. Honey yellow in color with the slightest haze. Started with a shirt white foam that left ladder of sticky lacings down the glass. Pungent, earthy, citrus hop aromas with a hint of malty sweetness beneath. Smooth, incredibly delicate feel with gentle, lazy carbonation and an oily feel toward the finish. Flavor was similar to aroma. Pungent citrus, pineapple, and rioe grapefruit flavors uo front with a tangy hop bite through the middle. Caramel malt flavors peek through toward the end. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Into IPAs or IIPAs? Once the next installment is announced, mark your calendar."
""
"Overall, I will buy this any chance I get as it was relatively cheap at $9 for the bottle."
""
"Overall, I base my opinion on whether or not I would buy the beer again, so I take into account the price, taste, and availability. A bomber for $10 that is hard to find, to me, is a steal for this type of beer. Phenomenal!"

"O: Fantastic DIPA. I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these in a sitting, but would probably pay for it shortly thereafter...But it's that good, and that smooth. Another west coast beaut!"

"2/14/14 Delicious with a excellent balance between hops and malts. The nose is great super floral with hints of pine and citrus, excellent flavor notes of citrus, pine, slight tropical fruit with a light malt backbone finishes super clean the """enjoy by""" just keeps getting better and better every release!"
""
""

"O - Really really really liked it. The average score might be dinged by the appearance but do you really care about that if it smells/tastes delicious? Easily one of my new favorite beers. Just a shame it isn't a common 12 pack :-)"

"Great beer. I tasted it only once before in December. Fresh A+ IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy By 2.14.14 from Volante Farms (grabbed the last one!). Beautiful with a nice frothy head, golden. My favorite Stone IPA by far. Juicy grapefruit, little bit of spice and resin. A little creamy. Lingering bitterness tastes like orange and pomelo pith. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer, I had the 4.20 last year and was just blown away, what really grabs my attention is the after taste and the over all freshness behind this beer. This year's 2.14 is amazing too, not quite the 4.20 to me though, but that might just be my palette changing over a year. Stone brewery does it again."
"Overall: certainly one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. The freshness of it definitely contributed to that, so props to Stone for putting an emphasis on it. The smell and taste are pure hop joy"
""
""
"O: An outstanding DIPA. Citrusy, piney, bitter, dry, and oozes freshness."
""
"Overall - Good beer. Punch in the nose and to the palate. It's a nice blend of citrus and slight spiciness that will surely leave you wanting next times batch. Got to try Enjoy by 11.12.13 as we'll (sad I didn't review) but I will be looking for this again next time."
""
""
""
"Enjoy By IPA 02.14.14, enjoyed on 01.31.14 in my DT tulip. Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white cap that dissipates into a froth and then an oily slick that coalesces into a thin band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing and a random swath present during the tasting. Great nose - tropical fruit, citrus rind, grapefruit, spiciness and an herbal/piney character. Taste is less fruity than suggested by the nose. Much more of a malty backbone as well as a spicy character and rind towards the finish. An oniony character is also revealed as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a bright, prickly carbonation and a light acidity that stimulates that tongue and salivary glands. Overall, quite interesting, but I have to say that I wish the flavor profile was a closer match for the nose - a bit too much malt and spice and not enough tropical fruit for my sensibilities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This second sampling proved to have a stronger citrus flavor which was accompanied by a notable spiciness. Also, the alcohol was much better in check this time. All around - a tastier iteration than the first."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very unique and fresh IPA! I can't remember having another quite like it, with the focus towards dank and peppery flavor. A pleasant change from the citrus forward fare of the day, but with enough grapefruit to remind you it's an American IPA. In my opinion, an outstanding beer."
""
"Overall, this is a beautifully crafted beer that absolutely lives up to the hype. Crisp, clean and tropical with a quick bitter punch. Highly recommended."

"Twas a great night. Started with the Stone so from what I remember. Was exceptional. Had a fridge just stocked for a good night of decent beers. Between the Dogfish Head and the local IPA from shipyard (Black and Monkey Fist), This was a spectacular night of great beer. 02.14.14 from Stone was highlight and also the 2nd to last trip to local packy. She sent me for smokes one more time, damn. But came home with a nice lil 5 spot for the night. The Stone was the star but you cant beat 90 min. from Dogfish Head. It's epic and we all know it. The fact i had a Sixer of the the local Shipyard IPA was a bonus and that Black IPA is real damn good. Stone continues to deliver and to be fair I live out in nowhere ME so the fact I'm getting this beer is just plane awesome. Wow I got min of 84 to go and all I can think about is that damn meatloaf i just microwaved. I shall go now and chow. drink well my friends Ü"
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent IPA and one that I will be trying to get again in coming versions for sure."
""
""
""
"This is my first experience with the Enjoy By series from Stone but if it is anything like the rest of their ipas, I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Lets get to it. This one pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a generous white head that gives way to a gentle and lasting Frothy film and decent lacing. The aroma of this is slightly disappointing. At first it seems perfect with a nice sweetness followed by a ton of citrus and floral hops. Alot of grapefruit and mangos, some pine and definitely some skunky grass aromas. As I smell deeper im finding notes of garlic and scallions. Not sure if it fits in this super fresh dipa profile. The flavor is delicious...at first. Super fresh and hoppy, bitter and sweet. Very balanced. A lot of citrus, pine, grass, and some nice malt and yeasty bread notes. But in the aftertaste is still those damn garlic and scallion notes. Its not bad by any means just seems to negatively affect the freshness that this ipa is known for. The body on this beer is wonderful. Medium and a little sticky. Coats the mouth with hoppy goodness for a long while. This is a great beer and I cant wait to try the next date in the series, however I do not believe it is anywhere near Stones finest offerings. But for an allocated beer how can one go wrong at just $7.99 a bomber."
" The taste is very hop drenched, lots of tangy citrus and zesty mango with some grapefruit and tropical flavors from the blend with slight catty tinge hinting there is some simcoe near the finish. Overall this is as good as expected based on the track record -lots of hop flavor which is helped by the freshness which shows..almost chalky from the raw vegetal matter jammed in- this is a quality Imperial IPA, one of the best I have had in recent memory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit 2015, over a year later I got to try Enjoy by 4/20/15, this is much better than the first Enjoy by I had, while it still has some green onion aspects to it, the fruity hops stick out the most and I enjoy it.  I bumped up the score to reflect this batch, while still keeping other batch in mind."
""
"I had the 2.14 bottle and more recently on tap. From the tap this beer was great. Pour amber orange with white head. The smell was outstanding with a good balanced pine and orange, grapefruit. The taste on this pour was wonderful with hoppy citrus forward and the bitter back end but the malt shined through and finished with some orange. I will say the bottle I had was not even close to this on draft. It was much more bitter and the taste just not as good. On draft this was great overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The dominance of the onion/garlic hop aroma and flavor are not what I appreciate in a good beer. This was very disappointing for me as I've heard so many positive reviews for this beer."
""
"Poured a rich light amber color with a creamy thick head of 3/4 inch. Significant lacing. Smell is making my mouth water. Taste - wow! Nice IPA, one of THE BEST I've ever had - Pure hoppy beautifulness! A truly great beer - enjoyed every last drop and want more!"
"Stone did this one really right. Awesome DIPA."
"O - Superfresh hopbomb...expected nothing less from Stone. Always delivers."
"O-Beer was very fun and definitely looking forward to what comes next in the series."
"O - I purchased two bottles from Copper Vine and shared the first with a couple of buddies. I'm now drinking the second and savoring every sip and I'm going to go back to get as much as I can tomorrow. This is one of the best beers I've had and it has it all for what you want and expect in a DIPA."
"Overall: very piney, good amount of bitterness as expected for style, but not harsh"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Stone has been one of my favorite brewers for quite some time. Good to see a brewer willing to put an expiration date right in the name rather a cryptic bottle code. Having it available in a growler was a bonus."

"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle picked up at Sprouts in Poway CA. Apperance is light golden with a pretty thin head upon pouring. Smells really fruity and hoppy. Very sweet smelling beer along with citrus notes and pine. Mouthfeel is thin. Taste…wow. Much sweeter then I was expecting! Not really any malt balance on this brew, very hop forward, but what else what you expect from a Stone IPA? I've been drinking lots of brown ales and stouts lately and this was my first IPA back from my malty phase, I enjoyed this brew but its almost a little TOO sweet for me personally. Hop heads should love this one."

"D - A truly excellent beer, but one that is a bit over hyped in the opinion... I personally would opt for a Ruinten any day of the week... With that slight disclosure out of the way, this is still a craft beer and especially a hop heads dream... The aroma is the star of the show... Overall, it seems to be a bit less than the sum of its parts..."
""
"Despite this being bottled two weeks ago, it seems to just be missing some freshness. The flavor profile isn't what I prefer with the style, but it kind of works. But, it's still pretty drinkable. I will have no problem polishing off the bomber myself."

"O: I must say, this being my first Enjoy By experience, I was a bit disappointed. I had only heard good things from friends and BAs, but it's not quite as marvelous as I had expected. Perhaps it's because I'm inevitably comparing it to Abner or Heady, but it strikes me as a slightly better, more alcoholic version of Long Trail Limbo that cost me $7 a bomber rather than $10 a sixes. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it, I enjoyed it, and I will probably get another one at some point. Try it for yourself, because fresh IPA is hard to come by."

"I first had Enjoy By at Poe's Tavern on Sullivan Island SC, and it was an almost religious experience.  Enjoy By is good from the bottle, but I think draft is superior."

"Enjoy by 02.14.14 IPA is a prisitine clear orange liquid topped with foamy light brown head that leave behind a nice foaming coating on the glass. The excellent appearance gives way to a strong sweet apricot hoppy nose that is simply delicious. On the tongue is it presents a strong hoppy bite. Behind that lies a fruity citrus that gives way to a wonderfully balanced lingering hop. In the mouth this beer is smooth, refreshing, clean and crisp. Quite simply this is a fantastic IPA. Certainly worth a night for the IPA lover. I don't advise is for a new drinker or non IPA person."

"I had the 12/2013 version. I've never really been blown away by a beer like this. Color and appearance was good (orange-gold), smell was nice (floral? it was a while ago)... but the flavor! The sheer ecstasy of this brew's first greeting to my taste buds seared itself into my mind and to this day has yet to let go. An incredibly balanced blend of citrus (orange, tangerine), warm bread, spices and hops... every flavor in perfect proportion, bold and up front and yet somehow sharing the stage equally with all the other elements going on - absolutely divine! If you ever see this, buy as much as you can and share it with good friends quickly."
"Notes 2: Mouthfeel is fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Wow, I was surprised by this """Enjoy by 02/14/14 IPA""" the look was typical of an IPA, a solid golden yellow/brown color with a good head. The smell was amazing; it might be the best part of the beer, an insane combo of floraly hops with a soft piney caramel to it. The mouth feel, sort of gummy, chewy, beer with a smooth finish. These taste is the only part that levels off the beer. A very solid pine cone cinnamon flowery finish that is classical of a solid IPA. Overall a great IPA. I'd have another."
"O - Overall, I am very pleased to have gotten to try it. It's one of the nicest DIPAs I've seen and the smell is really nice. I wish they could tone the bitter aftertaste a touch but other than that, it's a rock solid DIPA."
""
""
"Overall, this is just an incredible beer. Probably my favorite-ever IPA. So happy it made it to Georgia again, and I already can't wait until next time it comes here!"
"Poured from a 22oz. bottled about 12 days ago. Smell is beautiful and everything I want in a double IPA. Pine, grass, citrus, lemon, very small hints of alcohol. Taste is similar to how it smells. Opens with the piney/grassy taste, citrus fruit hits and finishes with a slight pear flavor. Very minimal alcohol flavor here. Very well hidden. This is my favorite beer and is my #1 recommended. Find it. It's worth it"
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer a has a nice fullness that feels like it surrounds the pallet but does not engulf the entire mouth. This feels like a big IPA but does not hit hard either but slips into a push into hops here, there, and everywhere."
"O: A great hop experience, and a beer that I would highly recommend. If you like DIPAs for their heavy malt character, this beer may not be for you but if you like hoppy beers then look no further. Believe the hype."
""
""
"Overall: This is my first IPA from Stone and am quite impressed. It's not the tropical citrus bomb that I like in a DIPA, but it's damn tasty hoppy brew that I will be more than happy to pick up any time I see one. Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
"Taste is hops, both leafy and fresh and bittering aftertaste. Juicy without being overly resinous and tastes like wet hops to me. The malt is light and pretty much gets the fuck out of the way and the alcohol is very well integrated. This is an outstanding beer...not going to compete with the best of DIPAs...but right there at the top of the second tier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I will go buy more of this tomorrow while it's still available."
"O - 4 - It's great, but not the best. It's been a while since I've had Pliny but I think this may be similar. A little bit more earthy/spicy/garlic notes than most of the other double IPAs, but it's still good."

"A: Pours a golden orange with an almost gray ring of head.\r\n\r\nS: Nose is utterly dominated by tangerine, fresh orange and other similar fruits, with just a touch of simcoey garlic.\r\n\r\nT: Fresh orange juice, citrus peel, onion, tangerine, tropical fruit, papaya. Delicious.\r\n\r\nM: Full bodied and smoother than your average IPA.\r\n\r\nO: By far my favorite beer from Stone. Uncharacteristic of them, hop-profile-wise, and that is a massive plus for me.\r\n\r\nNote: My version was best by 2.15.13, and I had it a couple days after this particular batch\'s release (It wasn\'t even on the shelf yet)."

"Enjoying a fresh 2.14.14. Glad to get this again in georgia. The last we got of this was 4.20 and i did not stock up enough. Once you crack this bottle you know you got something special. The aroma is funky is all the best ways. Great appearance and nice fluffy bit of head. Flavors are citrus, pine and ripe tropical fruit. Bitterness dominates the party in the best way. Mouth is just the slightest bit thin for a double ipa, but it wont detract from the overall experience. Alcohol is there for sure but not at all in the way. One of the best beers i have had since the last Enjoy By. Cant believe my local package store only got one case (!). Great representation of a west coast ipa and i will be buying each and every botle i see of this stuff."
"pours a crystal orange color nice head. Smells amazing hops citrus pine mmmm mmmm taste is of pine, orange, just enough bitterness on the tongue without killing the palate... abv is well hidden no booze no burn just a great balanced dipa... Will enjoy by any time I can get it..."
"A DIPA does not get much better than this. The top tier beers of the style come to mind when you taste and smell this beer. Citrus, pine, are all present in both taste and smell. You cannot taste the ABV at all. The appearance is unbelievable. If you can get this beer, buy it."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Despite displaying a ridiculous amount of hop flavor, it is not overly bitter. For being more than 9% abv, the alcohol is hidden really, really well. I would most certainly drink this again."

I want to try them all from the beginning but I don't know how realistic attaining all would be. And more important how fresh the tastings would be. Enjoy By will be enjoyed by most. It has a vegetable quality that works. Who knew I would like onion in my beer."

"A difficult beer to find but well worth picking up when you can."
"Bright orange/gold colour with a sticky, dense, eggshell cap. Good head retention and lasting lacing. Crazy hop aroma. Tons of grapefruit and orange, juicy, slightly tropical, bright and fresh. Nicely balanced flavour too. Lots of bitterness, sweetness, citrus, and alcohol. Lingering bitterness, earthy and citrus, with mild alcohol spiciness and some higher alcohol character. Mild warmth, medium plus body with smooth carbonation, excellent texture. This was really good -- balanced, bold and fresh."

"O: When very fresh its equal to any of the other big IIPA's. Aroma is the best of all of them IMO. Taste and mouthfeel maybe not as good as others but its close."
"I'm reviewing 12-13-13: Stone is the brand here in SD. Having said that, I'm typically a Green Flash guy. So it was with a little trepidation that I believed the hype on this beer. From the minute you pop the cap the hop fragrance takes hold of you. Smelled of weed and citrus, with a dash of pine. The first sip socks your jaw with hop pungency and light caramel tones. Then you notice the nice head and great color this brew displays. The alcohol is up there, being a DIPA, but doesn't overpower or take your buds off of the taste. Just enough kick on the back end. Very drinkable, and the mouthfeel is full, but not cottony. Overall one of my top 3 brews HANDS DOWN. Can't wait for 2-14-14...Get you some!"

"Last night's tasting showed a lot of bright fruit, tangerine, odd citrus like calamansi or yuzu, really great stuff. Much more hop complexity and vibrant nose than my first experience with Enjoy By 04.02.13. I'll look for this again and hopefully rate higher if there's consistency with recent taste. Glad I got to try this again, I see what the fuss is about now."

"09.13.13 version. Pours a two finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Light hazy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit hop nose and flavor is nearly sweet grapefruit and some pineapple, lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"Overall, I feel that this beer series is amazing. I have now had two different of the Enjoy By brews. One was in a bottle and the other was on tap. Both times they were still good. They are definitely worth trying and I don't feel someone would be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –This was a very enjoyable IPA. Rather balanced for a stone brew in my opinion and not quite what I was anticipating. It blended a sweeter and thicker base with a nice hop profile, making for one very enjoyable sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a stellar beer. I've had several different batches (7.4.13, 9.13.13, 10.25.13 and now 12.13.13) and I must admit it's hard to resist the temptation to buy a new bottle from each release. A quality double IPA that certainly stands up to the marketing efforts that surround it. One of my favorites from Stone."

"O: Really well done. Nice and balanced considering the nose and i love how it has that quenching wet sort of feel too it. Makes this one super drinkable and sets it apart not only form stones other IPAs but most others i have had. I would put it up there with Pliny for sure. Stone does it again!"
"Overall: Amazing. I was shocked to see this in stock at my little liquor store in IL, and couldn't be happier I grabbed it. I'll be going back shortly to buy them out. A great, fresh IPA that's refreshing, citrusy and not ridiculously bitter. Try it if you have the chance!"
"Overall, one of Stone's best and a favorite of mine."
""
"Enjoy by 12.13.13 bomber. Lots of resiny smell, fresh thick hops, dry intense grapefruit aromas, colour is a bright clear gold, plenty of carbonation but the smoothest mouthfeel and no hint of alcohol, this is really awesome, smooth balanced profile, tons of hop character. Really well constructed IIPA and just an amazingly fresh tasty beer. Pleasant dry finish and a quenching juicy drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - stupendous and delicious."
""
""
"Pours a transparent golden sunset color with about a finger of white head that retains well. The smell is that of dank, oily, earthy hops, a bit of onion, lemon, grapefruit, and orange peel. The smell is amazingly fresh, so I would say Stone succeeded in what they set out to do. The taste follows the nose, delivering a resinous, mouth-coating blast of bitterness right up front along with grapefruit and orange notes. There is also a weird onion taste that detracts from the quality of the beer, but it's not overwhelming. The finish is dry and unapologetically bitter, leaving a tingling in the back of my throat."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing IPA. Extremely fresh and full of citrus hops. As fresh as you can get out a bottle. Initial taste is full of fresh grapefruit, pineapple, and a bit of orange hops. Carbonation is absolutely perfect. The beer is so fresh tasting that it gives you quenching like taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Grapefruit dominates, along with pine. Not as tropical as you might expect from a SoCal IPA. A little bit of skunkiness. In the finish, that oily sensation from too much hops, medium finish. Bitterness lingers. It's a good beer, and fresh, but it's a bit too harsh for me. I might try this again though if I can get it under 2 weeks old."

"O: Easily one of the top 5 IPAs I've had (and I've had a lot of the """best""" IPAs available.) Lots of depth, fairly easy to acquire, great price, and a perfect indicator of when to drink this amazing beer!"
""
"O - An excellent DIPA, I can't believe I've waited this long to have one. It is well balanced, you have no idea it is 9+ abv."
""
"I went to a craft beer market, ask a staff for the best IPS he ever had, the guy didn't even blink and grab me this Stone IPA Enjoy By 12-12-13, pour with a nice inch foam, light orange color, floral aroma that I really enjoy it, first it had bitter taste, but in a good way, smooth finished."
"Maybe the prettiest IPA I've ever seen: absolutely transparent, beautiful golden color, small head that dissipates but I'm still pretty psyched about the color and clarity of this beer. Smell is massive grapefruit hops, some citrus, random hints of random fruits. Insane hop flavor right away! Heavy floral hops, then grapefruit, then citrus, then the massive bittering kicks in. Absolutely coats the mouth. The bitterness is a little higher than I usually like but the fresh hop character is astounding. Aside from the lingering bitterness, the finish is really crisp and dry on this - I just realized this is 9.4% abv and now I'm even more impressed. Way too easy to drink considering its strength. It's easy to love stronger ales but this one really deserves it."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent, and a little different than you typical Stone brew. Focuses on the aromatic side of hops, instead of cramming bitterness down your throat. Very enjoyable, and I think they are targeting Pliny the Elder with this one. Can't say which I would rather have, but they are both world class."
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is potently hop but once it touches your tongue, the feel gives you a slight bite, finishing with a smoothness. This is very well balanced. The taste seems subdued compared to the aroma."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. One of the best beers I've ever had; it really is quite amazing. Tried the 12/13/13 and it was 10/10 honestly. Ingeniously fresh with an amazing hoppy flavor, bitter but not overly bitter at all. Perfect. Not a single hint of the 9.4 ABV. Not quite sure on the IBU's but either way, it is everything you could ask for in a beer. Good job Stone, good job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I get the enjoy by every time I see it. This is in my top 5 DIPA's ever and I like the fact it is very easy to get throughout the year. I put the enjoy by up there with Dogfish Head Burton Baton and Coast breweries Boyking. A phenomenal beer."

"One of my new favorite series, a big, bold and fresh IPA. Citrus plays second fiddle to strong earthy Flavors. A well hidden 9.4% ABV makes this a must seek and buy~"
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: This was so good I went out and bought another.. Second one wasn't cold when i bought it but at $6 a bottle it seemed like a steal. Tasted like soapy shit. Moral of the story this thing spoils quick way before the enjoy by date if its not cold. Plus, when this brew goes bad it goes really really fucking bad! Had the second one on 11-18-13 and it had already spoiled (12-13-13 IPA)."

"Reviewing the 12/13/13. Aroma: Very herby, slightly metallic, resinous and skunky. Appearance: clear gold, little carbonation and nearly any foam. Very dry, off bitterness. notes of cinnamon, spice, herbs, resin and biscuit are available. Not too much citrus available. Overall, one of the more basic/standard Enjoy By's I have experienced. Not bad. Bitter, alcohol filled, dry."

""

"Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs out there and for the price point there are really few, if any, which are better options. Drink this as fresh as possible, the hop flavor is beautiful and balances the bitterness, which is necessary given the heavy malt backbone. This is Stone's best beer, for sure."
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Compared to other IPAs I have had, this one is a bit heavy handed with the amount of bitterness present. I would have preferred some malt characteristics and tropical fruit. Probably wont seek this one out again."
""
"O - Great beer nose-wise. The smell really pops and makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I also really like the hop combinations. Had the last version on tap at the brewery and thought it was more malty and boozy."
""
"I bought 6 bottles of this and I'm glad I did."
""
""
""
""
""
"I waited until the last day this beer was """fresh""" and it still tastes great, though I'm sure it would have been even better two weeks ago. I'd absolutely love it if it were a tad less sweet on the front and had more of a biscuit-not-caramel malt character. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
"An okay DIPA under some circumstances but does not really do anything for me. Maybe I'll have to drink one of these earlier than the expiration date. Some people might like the Enjoy be a certain date DIPA gimmick but I'm not one of them."
""
""
"Beautiful pour from 22oz into pub glass. Golden Color nice lacing and decent head. Complex hops on the nose citrus and some onion dank like pleasant fresh smell. Heavy alcohol mouthfeel. No real carbonation. A sweaty strong too bitter unbalanced finish which is the only part of this I didn't love. Really don't understand the devotion to this series as its not Stone's best. Stone Ruination IPA even thought higher in IBU finishes so much cleaner than this."

"What an awesome beer. Had this twice. Last one was the 11/12/13 batch. Crisp, clean, tropical and just outstanding. From memory, appearance was clear as you expect from stone. Aroma and taste all tropical hop goodness, just what I look for in an IPA. As of today this beer tops my list."
""
"Overall, I did not like this at all. There is an overwhelming taste of onions, and I find it offensive on the palate and nose. I will try the next Enjoy By and hope for more pine and no onion."

"Strong, this was but this certainly did not feel it. Downing a whole bottle will make you woozy but with the appeal and bitterness of a Troegs Nugget Nectar combined with a rich array of sensual aspects and a chocolate-chili type aftertaste, there's a ton to like here. This was so clean and crisp that it misled me into thinking that it was an American Amber but alas, it's just an IPA that lives up to the """Imperial""" moniker. Loads to love here, even without the date on the bottle. This was one beer that you'll want to drink as soon as you get your hands on it!"

"edit - After the last 2 batches available in NJ were just nowhere near as good as the first 3 I had I felt it necessary to alter my scores from the perfect 5s across the board that I had given it.

"I don't want to call this a complete disappointment. But it's a beer that doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's dry, yet finishes sticky and a little sweet. The hop profile is slightly all over the place- some may call this """complex," but out of a world class IPA, I expect an identity. This is a nicely-made, well-rounded, strong-flavored, yet ultimately boring IPA."

"Final Thoughts: I was lucky enough to try an earlier batch of Enjoy By on-tap in Colorado in a flight next to PtE a couple months ago and Enjoy By was the better of the two (albeit by a narrow margin). The lack of malt flavor makes this beer even more impressive because there are no detectable flaws in the flavor and it seems to be consistent from one batch to the next. The Enjoy By series proves that Stone gets it. They understand that the consumer wants a fresh product, which means a lot coming from such a large brewery that doesn't need to be doing this kind of thing to survive in the vastly expanding craft beer industry. I have the utmost respect for Stone because they have respect for the consumer. The fact that Enjoy By is such a fantastic IPA is just the icing on the cake in this situation. Would I drink it again? Yes, anytime I can get my hands on it."

If you're reading this and you stumble upon one of these past the date, don't hesitate to try it, It's definitely worth the money. It goes without saying this has to be marvelous if you are lucky to score a bottle right away too."
"Although being the same beer everytime (just new batches) just like evrything else at Stone, its consistent. I enjoyed the Hoppiness without the distraction of so much bitterness, which was a bit wierd for a stone beer. I was expecting a booze bomb but its actually very balanced. A very smooth 9.4% abv."

"Bottle. Opened 2 days before """drink by""" date. Clear dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Initially upon opening, there is a nice hop aroma, but it attenuates slight soon thereafter. Big malt profile that overpowers the hops. No doubt that this is a double. Some apricot in the nose, but mostly hops and malt. The flavor is good, but the bitterness is a little harsh. Palate is perfect for a double. Medium carbonation that rapidly dissipates. It's a big beer. Well done, but a little heavy-handed. I like what Stone is trying to do here. I just prefer an IPA with a bit more balance."

"Post Initial Review Note: 09.13.13 was close to a perfect 5! 11.13.13 not as good, recommendation is to try many releases as possible and often! 2.14.14 closer to 9.13.13 release, great stuff Stone! 4.20.14 release was superb, really not digging the 12.26.14 release, maybe next time! 02.14.14 was excellent!"

"Enjoy yet another quality IPA from Stone. Cheers!"

"Overall fantastic hops! The standard year round IPAs from Stone are pretty good, but these Enjoy By beers are world class."
""
""
""
"D: This was a fantastic punch in the mouth! The scent was phenomenal, and the taste was great. The body was good, and the alcohol was well hidden. The finish was powerful, so it was easier to sip. This one lives up to the hype. Impressive brew, and top tier IPA."

"does not drink like a 9% beer. very easy to quaff. way too easy to quaff! I look forward to more beers in this series."
"I've had a few of these Enjoy By beers and they've all been lovely. I hope Stone keeps up the trend."

"Very appealing, pours nice with amber color. It smells floral with piney notes in the end, some citrus hints... Refreshing taste, the fruity notes hids the alcohol very well. Smooth! Overall...me like it so much...I will definitely buy a couple of more bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a medium off-white head. Aromas of grapefruit rind and vanilla. Taste begins with some massive apricot, followed by some candied dates, then some resinous, pine Forrest finish. Mouthfeel is super rich. Overall an excellent DIPA. The expiration date being clearly marked is a HUGE plus, I wish all hoppy beers were labeled this way."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a goblet. This was the newest version of the best by series (by 11.12.13). I thought this beer was outstanding. Very mellow for a double. It poured like most IPAs with the golden hue with average head. Smell was good, but not anything special. Overall, it was outstanding. I was mightily impressed by Stone with this one."

"O- Everything about this double IPA is intense, distinct, and full flavored. The amount of concentrated hop aromas, flavors, and acids that are packed into this beer is quite impressive. Yet it isn't so domineering, because I wish I had another bottle to drink right now. However, I think this beer is making me realize that I'm not a huge fan of double IPA's at this point in my drinking career, which is reflected in my overall score of only 4. With that being said, I can certainly still appreciate the skilled craftsmanship involved in the creation of this fine brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow... wow. Big-time west-coast hop-bomb! The hops explode in this beer, and while that is getting more and more common, this one does it with incredible complexity and subtlety. You can pull out a huge array of hop flavors, and they all stand distinct, without a messy overall character. The balance is extraordinary, and that is an accomplishment in the West-Coast IPA style. The concept of this beer is awesome, get it to the customer as fast as possible and teach distributors about the importance of fresh IPAs. But, the execution was even better, Mitch Steele nailed this one."

"O: So fresh and so flavorful. I attribute this mostly to the freshness which really brings the hop flavors out. A must grab and enjoy it now ."
"Copper yellow in color. Nice full creamy head with solid lacing. Sharp and dry in the mouth. Huge citrus hops with nice bitter after taste. Some herb notes. Not much malt flavors but what would think with DIPA. A nice brew that goes well with most foods. Had beef tacos with my taste."

"Pours a bright copper color. Aroma of citrus, pine and dank herb. In the taste, pine and mango like tropical fruityness. Bright citrus and tropical fruit profile with some strong bitterness. Little hint of alcohol but quite bitter with a honey like malt profile. Medium bodied, with a moderate carbonation and smooth overall feel. This is a great imperial IPA, but much too exclusive."

"O - it is everything it says it is. An extremely fresh double ipa with the quality to back up all the hype. It's something ill always look for from now on. Easily one of the best DIPA's on the planet and one of my new favorites. It has it all the right pieces perfectly in place for a truly special release. I sure hope we get the next batch! A must try"
""
"Citrus redux. Bright and fresh, with Lagunitas-like tastiness. Roughs up a bit at the end to let you know it's for real but absolutely no heat, making it one of the most smooth and easy DIPAs around."
""
""
""
"O - Consuming the second glass at a cooler temperature allows more citrusy flavors to shine through the spice i was initially getting from the first glass. fringe 4.5 overall gets the bump up"

"Overall - At a bottle share, this DIPA was consumed in succession with Pipeworks Unicorn's Revenge. While this one is good, Unicorn's Revenge was the consensus winner."

"1700th review! 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, peach, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of tropical and citrus hops with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, and light caramel on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity of big citrus/tropical hop flavors with surprisingly light pine presence; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA as expected. All around awesome complexity of tropical/citrus hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering."
""
""
"Enjoy by on the day. A day of both sadness and joy as we say goodbye to a grandma and celebrate the b-day of my son. A big 4. A memorable day capped by a memorable beer. Stone lives up to their rep and the hype. Great beer living up to a day to remember for a life, capped by 9/13/13 . Truly enjoyed as we celebrate a life well lived for 93 years and the exhuberence of a 4 year old. A great lasting Hops enfused beer memory."
""
"O= This is a great beer. I grabbed it on the last day and it's still drinking like a champ. I would drink this tomorrow even if Stone doesn't recommend it."
""
"O - Just an excellent Imperial IPA. One of the better I've had in awhile. It kind of gets everything right, but the tad bit of harshness before it mellows out stops it from being exceptional. But, truthfully, that's nit picking as this is a tremendous beer when compared to others in its style."

"Just opened a bottle of 09.13.13 and this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It tastes like I got it straight from the brewery. Smooth, hoppy without being over-bearing and a finish as smooth as silk. It's everything that I wish Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA would have been without the mouth-destroying feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It poured a nice golden hue with a subdued white head. The aroma of hops jumped out of the bottle with fruity citrus notes, a bit of pine and even the dank hops I know and love. There are obviously a lot of hops which is to be expected from a Stone IPA, but they were handled very well. Loads and loads, but balanced so as not to give you the bitter beer face or palate wrecking experience of some IPAs. There were tropical fruits and citrus on the front end with the pine bitterness coming through on the back leaving a nice bitter coating on your palate. All of these great hop flavors were riding a danky hoppiness that held it all together. The Enjoy By IPA really handled the hops with a more delicate balance. One of my all time favorite IPAs."

"O - If I had a choice between this 17th Anniversary, or RuinTen, I would take this beer without hesitation. I enjoy it more than the 17th anniversary... and even more than the 16th Anniversary. I would put this up with the best-of-the-best double IPAs out there. Double Jack, Pliny the Elder, Cafe Racer 15 - Enjoy By is definitely in the big leagues. One of my favorite IPAs. Easily."
"O:These """Enjoy By""" brews are wonderful. Also tried a Enjoy By 4.21.13 on tap in prior experience and was very impressed. 9.3 abv and you can hardly tell. A very smooth DIPA that is great to sip on. I would definitely go out of my way for one of these."
"I had the opportunity to consume three bottles of Stone's Enjoy By (9.21.12) which was the first run of this special release the brewery made available to the greater tri-state area, being New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York."

"Unbelievably fresh, aromatic, and deliciously balanced IPA befitting the ratings it's received here. I'm looking forward to trying it on draft soon. The notes of fruit are apparent immediately and the finish is undeniably smooth. Up there with Heady Topper with my favorite IPA so far."
""
"Overall, just what a DIPA should be. It's a high octane beer that drinks easy. This one is focused intensely on hop flavor and aroma with just enough bitterness and malt to balance the beer out and hide the alcohol content. One of the best DIPAs I've had."
""
"Fantastic IPA! Great aroma and color as soon as you tap it! Had the privilege of enjoying it on tap at the Craft Ale House in Limerick, PA. This beer rivals Pliny The Elder or Firestone Double Jack IPA. Great citrus from the first sip and great hops throughout with a good malty finish. This is a top flight beer!"

"I was so excited to see a local bottle shop, Vino Rosso in Idaho Falls got a keg of Enjoy by 9-13-13! They had it posted on a sandwich board out side the shop that said """Get it while you can!!!!""". I was actually off the day I had it and was just swinging by the office to pick up my paycheck and take it to the bank,which is right by the bottle shop,how convenient! It was heaven in a glass!!! Nice and stinky,looked just perfect,color,carb,lacing... and it was a taste explosion. Hop bomb delight!!!! This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 to. I swore I didn't think there was a 5 out there,there is,this is it!!! Went back the next night with my built in designated driver(my wife) and enjoyed a few more! If this beer has and equal or one is ever brewed I hope the good lord sees it fit to have it find it's way to my lips...It is the holy grail of beers as far as I am concerned!!!"

"Clear pale orange colored with a low white head that leaves legs of lace rising up the dudes of the glass. Low aroma of honied mslt and orange rind. Rich flavor bursting with hop flavors - grapefruit, tangerine and orange rind pith. Subtle malt balance, but this is a showcase of hops. Mild bitterness, understated alcohol strength. Slightly slick mouthfeel. Overall a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Consistently impressive west coast DIPA. Has that prototypical yellow-gold color I associate with wcipas. Nose is super piney with a hint of citrus. This is 7.4.14 and I think it's less citrusy than previous ones. Mouthfeel is light but creamy, yet it still carries a bite. Aftertaste is really dry. This is a liquid pine cone that nearly bites your face off."
""
""
"Overall: My 150th unique beer according to my personal list, and certainly one worthy of the milestone. This is an incredible beer, and I would highly recommend it if its distro'd out to your area. Would by again without thinking twice. ENJOY BY 09.13.13!"
""
""
""
"I had this one back to back with the ever outstanding Alchemist Heady Topper and I actually liked this one better. Must be those west coast hops rather than Vermont hops."
""
""

"It feels perfect in the mouth, just the right bitterness with a bitter/sweet aftertaste that just keeps wanting to be tried again and again. and I will try again, my store had 4 left and I will be going back to buy the rest hopefully before someone else figures it out. keep it coming Stone, beer is good!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Stone crushed it once again. I have had two of the previous batches, and the consistency has been outstanding. This series is easily top tier among double ipas, and at an amazing value as well. It has quickly become a benchmark of the style. Any hophead should enjoy this beer."
""

""

"This beer is the reason you drink an IPA. It's bountiful in it's hop character. It's decadent in it's fruit sweetness. It's malt is superb and flows underneath it all to lead you to a spectacular bitter. It's pronounced but it's not egregious. It's not heavy, it's light. the mouthfeel is something you don't even think about until you are lost in the aftertaste. So glad I tired this. One of the best beers I have had this year."

"I'm not sure if the balance and blend of perfect malts with perfect hops happens here. It just misses on the most elite of elite ipa's but I'm splitting hairs here."

"O: Crisp bold hops that engulfs your palate and sweeten it with a toasted malt base. I have been waiting to get this as fresh as I could. This is a huge statement for freshness. I love this beer and I can't wait till the next one."
"O - A shock goes through me every time I see the """Enjoy By""" label appear on the shelves. I then proceed to clear the rack. This has everything I want in a big IPA; deep bassy malts, intense bitters, and a strong abv."

"I've heard others descripe this as 'juicy'...now I know what they meant. Beautiful aroma of citrus and pear. Perfectly balanced. A nice smooth mouth feel that only accentuates the malty sweetness on the back of the palate. A 'must have' in these waning days of summer."

""
" O- I really like this beer. I'd buy it again. If I could improve one thing it would be making the grain bill more pronounced but hey, its an IPA."

"UPDATE 2/5/14 for ENJOY BY 2.14.14: Gotta improve my appearance score for this one, to 4.5, two inch tall white head receded slowly to rocky surface foam and dense patterned lacing. There have been so many great new DIPAS out since my last Enjoy By in November, some of which I'd rate close to or even higher than Enjoy By, and it's still so expensive at $8+ a bomber, that I may well stop at buying one bottle per issue from now on. Consider Lagunitas Sucks (not new but the new issue is out, plentiful and relatively cheap), Green Flash Palate Wrecker, Sixpoint Hi-Res, Long Trail Limbo, Smuttynose Durty, Victory Dirt Wolf and Hop Ranch and Otter Creek/Lawson Double Dose, etc. Enjoy By is great, but new competition, some of which is at a lower to much lower price point, is making it less of a must-have IMO."

"Review of 9-13-13. Pours a glorious crystal-clear amber color with a pure white foam that dissipates a bit quickly. The nose gives a powerful blend of pine and citrus hops, with a hint of nectarine underneath. The first sip is wonderfully rich and complex, with an assertive (but not over-the-top) hoppiness evenly balanced with a subtly sweet caramel malt and an odd twinge around the edges that I just can't put my finger on -- maybe a weird blend of mango and onion? Very nice smooth texture, relatively full-bodied, dry on the upper palate. The finish is kind of short, but leaves a nice lingering bitterness. Overall, an excellent example of the DIPA style. Well done, gentlemen."
""

"9-13:"""Enjoyed""" from a bottle purchased from Pinocchio's in Media and served in a snifter. Poured a light golden orange with a one-finger head which dissipated almost immediately to a thin coating. While there was light lacing, it marked the glass throughout. The nose was oranges, lemon, grapefruit, mango, and pine. The taste was wonderfully hop-centric, with oranges and lemon predominating but the malts in the background ALMOST come forward for balance. The finish was only slightly bitter, moderately dry and slick. Beer was medium in body and somewhat oily with nice carbonation. None of these descriptors would necessarily suggest my conclusion that this was a GREAT DIPA. I wasn't prepared for HOW good, given my previous experiences with Stone's other Enjoy By offerings. If you like hoppy beers, you MUST try this!"
""
""
""
"It's been a long time since I've had an ipa this good and is making me fall in love with hops all over again. I will look for this beer again!"
"As an edit I had the 12.26.14. The nose was extremely oniony which was a big time turn off. Couldn't get past that. It was fresh but I wouldn't give it a 99. Maybe a b*. What happened?"
"Overall- Really good beer. The onion character is actually a good accent for both the taste and smell. Not an overly dry beer and very drinkable."

"O - Overall, a solid beer from stone. Gotta love a good, fresh DIPA."
"Overall: This is a great IPA, and a perfect example of the style. It takes bitter to the next level. My girlfriend describes it as an """alcohol waterfall," and that somehow seems appropriate."
"Overall I can drink it but its too bitter and medicinal for me. Wish it had more balance."
""
""
"O: A damn fine beer, not quite worthy of the hype only because of how very much hype every release seems to generate. Strip the fervor that its rotating geographical release causes away, and the beer itself is easily among the best examples of the DIPA category that I've enjoyed. Would have again in a heartbeat."
""
"Okay so the only and I mean the only reason I do not give this beer a blanket 5.0 is that only God is perfect. I mean there is no such thing as a perfect woman so I guess beer would have to fall in that category, please beer take no offense. I usually do not get excited about the color of a beer this one though has a nice peach looking color to it great eye appeal, just something a little different from other IPA's and their copper-orange color. Great hit of citrus when I stuck my nose in my glass, holy crud the alcohol content is hitting me already, WOW, and lingered well after the head fizzled down. The same with the first intake of the beer, real good citrus flavor followed by a smooth and mellow wheat flavor. For being an Imperial (double IPA) this is unusually mellow yet like I said holy crud the alcohol is hard hitting. This is definately not a swilling IPA, take the time to really enjoy this IPA, you will be pleased each pull on this beer is just as good as the first. The good thing is that the after taste of the beer does not hang around leaving you with that """I just licked a leather boot heal""" taste in your mouth that some shoddier IPA's will have the tendency to do. This is an excellent IPA, I look forward to the next batch of Enjoy By, Stone Brewing be darn proud of this beer, darn proud. Now if you all will excuse me I have a girlfriend to go drink."
""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a quickly dissipating, two finger head that settles into a spotty cap that lasts throughout. Decent lacing. Great floral aroma up front with nice sweet malt notes in the background. Hoppy bitterness hits the front of the tongue followed by a torrent of pine resin and grapefruit rind. Sweet malt backbone balances the hops nicely. Mouthfeel is where this ale shines; smooth and easy drinking for the ABV. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding example of an Imperial IPA, extremely well crafted and balanced. Kudos Stone."

"Finally tried this. On tap at Bottle Revolution in Raleigh. Looks great. Fantastic aroma with lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Flavor heavy on the bitterness over the more subtle hop flavors. Great stuff. I hate that it's hard to find but like the emphasis on freshness."
"A beer, I have been wanting to try...that doesn't come along so much anymore. I'm not saying it's hyped up but I love fresh IPA. The concept was something I fell in love with the date is 8/24/13 the bottle says to drink by 9/13/13. Look it's expressive in appearance, copper bright body almost an orange layered hue to the beer with cream almost white head forms thick. Fine speckled lacing I'm again in love, why does this have to be the beer, one which sells out quicker than stores can get it in. Aroma has bright grapefruit, citrus notes that expel any notion of less than fresh hops. It's actually an explosion of hops withheld in a room of fresh hops, earthy qualities are dumbed down by bright citrus. Each gulp goes down smoother than the next, beautiful beer I'm drinking each sip thinking where is the next drink coming from that's a strong hook that radio DJs look for in every overproduced song on the market. This is not overproduced it's just the best quality beer of every quality IPA you have ever tried. Slick oily mouthfeel leads to expressive carbonation levels soft and excellent between every twist and turn get me a case and I will drink it."
"no real difference in taste or appearance, this is a very solid double ipa, and i reccommend it to any fan of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty ale but not quite as good as the smell promises."
"Medium thickness in the mouthfeel, with very little notice of the alcohol. This might be the best Stone beer I've ever had. RuinTen is close, but both are exceptional DIPAs."
""
"Tremendously satisfying. Absolutley love it. I wish I could drink this year round."
"Overall- Love it. This is an amazing taste that hits all my happy places for an IPA. SOOO glad I was able to get my hands on these. Definitely worth the hype. Wish I had been able to get more than two!"
"update: the 2.14.14 seems to be a different brew with different hops. more tangy and juicy with fruit flavors. a bit thinner, too, it seems, but it's an even better brew. is it my imagination?"

"The palate is quite bitter, with a blend of dank weed, pine resin and grapefruit pith lending plenty of bitterness. Alcohol is noticeable, emphasizing the brashness of the pungent hops. Faintly soapy as well. A little sweetness is present, mildly sugary with a burnt sugar effect(especially in conjunction with the hop bitterness). medium light in body, this beer is moderately carbonated and has a long, pungent finish that's a touch soapy. This is more of a bitter , dank west coast dipa than the more recent hugely aromatic dipas that are all the rage. Recommended."

"This is the best beer I have had since I started to get into craft beers. I have always loved skunky beers and this beer has tremendous hoppy flavor, but it also has a piney slightly skunky flavor. I've had Pliny the Elder and I think this beer has an edge on it."
"9/13/13 version. Pours a translucent, golden orange color with a finger length head that dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is amazing. Tons of of overly ripe pineapple, some grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach, more tropical fruit notes, pine, tiny bit of breadiness and sweetness from the malts. Taste starts with some bitterness, but more tropical and citrus fruits like pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, mangos, some floral qualities as well. Was already smooth on the front end, but then gets even smoother and creamier in the middle from the malts that somewhat balance it. Then finishes dry with more tropical and citrus fruits, as well as some pine qualities. Very smooth and crisp finish that cleans the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Has a slight sweetness throughout, which complements the hop characters and gives the hop flavors almost a gummy bear-like taste. High medium, oily body. No alcohol detected at all. From what I read, this beer is made with mostly flavoring hops and not many bittering hops. I agree with this, as there are just massive amounts of juicy fruits in this. Better than Ruination in my opinion. Well done!"

"O: I always get so excited for this to hit my state and for a good reason. It never lets down. This IPA is fresh as hell but freshness wouldn't mean a thing if it wasn't an unbelievable IPA to begin with. Pretty far up on my list!"
""
""
"4.75, 3.5, 3.25, 3, 3.25; 3.33."
"Overall: The Enjoy By concept is a very appealing idea as super fresh IPAs aren't always easy to find, but this does make them available for a known, limited time (depending on the markets to which its distributed). However when it does make its way around, it's quite easy to find and priced about reasonably at around $6.99 per bottle (in this area at least). This beer is really quite a treat and highly recommended to try."
""
""

"Ultimately, the flavors and aromas remind me alot of the stellar IPA/DIPAs out there. There's not much to complain about. This is a very enjoyable DIPA."

"Based on the 08.02.13 batch. Poured a gorgeous clear amber, with a half finger white head. It looks fantastic poured into a tulip. Scents of pine, citrus, especially grapefruit, pineapple, slight tropical fruit and a bit of malt. The scent is fantastic and entices you to drink. Each sniff made me want to take the first sip more and more. Flavor begins with a burst of bitter citrus and grapefruit pith moving into a blend of grapefruit and bitter pine and finishing with a nice resiny pine flavor and aftertaste. A hint of malt sweetness in the middle blends wonderfully with the hop flavors and a noticeable alcohol presence hits at the end. An amazing double IPA flavor profile, comparing favorably with the best of the others of it's style I've tasted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's standard, but not bad. A sublime double IPA. Full of hop flavor, with an extreme bitterness and citrus flavors. It slams your palette with it's assertive flavor and doesn't relent. Well worth getting, a fantastic beer and a great showing from Stone."

"I had the pleasure to have this in bottle and on tap. For a beer with a abv of around 9 it sure doesn't taste like it. It was a nice aroma and an excellent hoppy taste. The only bad thing about this beer is its avalibility. Unless you live on the left coast its gonna be hard to get some here in mass, but if you are fortunite to get your hands on it enjoy every ounce of this wonderfull beer."

"Highly enjoyed. Highly recommended."

"I've been told that """Enjoy By IPA""" varies from batch to batch. In that case, I've had a taste from an amazing batch, because this was as exceptional as an IPA gets. The nose was fruity, floral, not too herbal or piney; I won't bore anyone with talk of lacing or head retention, lets cut right to the flavor. Oh my god. The marriage of fruity and citrusy hops is mind blowingly delicious and so different from the herbal, piney IPAs that Stone is known for. If you are a fan of IPAs, you must try this and see for yourself. I dream about this beer at night and think about it when I'm thirsty. I'm hooked!"

"Golden colored and pristine clarity. Moderate head retention. Beautiful. Lots of of busy carbonation bubble business. Intensely pine aroma, very freshly picked and it shows in the nose. Taste is intensely hop oriented. Did I just bite into a hop straight off of the vine? Wow! This is truly a unique and wonderful experience. Must try."

"651mL Enjoy By 12.21.12 bottled on 11/16/12 and consumed 11/27/12. Hot tamale. Big thanks to peteinsd for this one! Pours still near chardonnay white to brilliant gold. Full clarity, not bottle conditioned like it should be. Medium, buttermilk head. Spotty lace. Nose is soft orange fruits, nectar fruits, peach, white grapes, Alpine style butterscotch, salted caramel. Yumm. Taste is oily, lightly bitter, not too aggressive, actually very soft with white grape juice, white peach, some white pepper. Very nice. Reminds me of Alpine Duet. Palate is oily, spicy. 8/4/8/5/16=4.1"

"The beer pours a dark amber color with a few centimeters of nice foam. Super fresh hops emerge from the aroma: pine, orange, and grapefruit. Alcohol clears the sinuses along with a wee bit of caramel in the background. Medium bodied and smooth, almost creamy, but for the carbonation Lots of hops in the flavor, as expected. Piney resin and citrus both contribute, but pine is the biggest contributor. A hint of malt brings it all together. Very enjoyable."

"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, pineapple, and small orange citrus hops. In the taste, big fresh hops, with orange citrus and a mix of pine hops, and a small minty like burn. A nice hop bitterness and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer fresh pine hop like aftertaste. Big and fresh hops, the only flaw, it is almost too fresh, but really nice."

"What can I say? Perfect Pilsner-like color* For those who would argue that it should be more appropriately copper colored... *The first officially designated American craft brewed IPA was Grant’s, and it contained Pilsener malts of this golden hue. The nose is an exquisite melange of grapefruit, Mandarin orange, tangerine, pinapple, mango, kiwi, and lemon/lime. The flavors follow suit, and the body is medium to full with just the right amount of malt backbone which is more of a textural thing, in this case, than a flavor enhancer. The hops are given free reign to truly shine here. The balance is nearly flawless, right through the long, dry finish which is crisp, and remarkably refreshing. Wow!"

"Newest batch: 07-04-13. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that goes down quickly. Scent is immediately floral, but quickly fades to DANK hops. I can't help but be reminded of the hoppy beers from Alpine when I smell this special offering from Stone. The hop scent on this is just so damn inviting, it's ridiculous. Sweet, but not malty...it's a sweet, hoppy resin aroma. Some pine and a ton of citrus fruit with a hint of pineapple and mango. Taste is just as it smells. It is so hard to explain this beer, because it is so delicious and everything an imperial IPA should be. So fresh and so clean...as Outkast would say. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. Drinkability is VERY high! This is a top notch IPA that reminds me of the quality that Alpine produces. Definitely my favorite hoppy Stone beer."

"Overall-Excellent example of the type. For me, this would be a constant in my fridge if it was always available. Great alone, but stands up very well to strong food flavors. Seems to hold it's carbonation better than most others of the style. I had a pint sit for a couple of hours and still taste great, where others seem to go flat very quickly. Now I need to find out if Stone has it on Nitro at their tasting room..."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with ample carbonation. Very nice. Overall, I thought this was an outstanding IPA. The hop character is very resinous and very pronounced, but all in all the beer has a nice balance. Super."
""
""
""
"O: This is a bitter, in your face beer--I like it--but I wish it had a bit more of a malty sweetness underneath; but like I said, it is still a darn good beer"
""
""
"Golden with a loose soapy white foam sheet. Smells nice: mango, pineapple, resin, biscuit, dextrose, bit of mint. Bitter, sweet, sugar sweetness, some onion, some body odor, some grapefruit. Medium bodied with moderately sharp carb and an off dry finish. This was better the first time I tried it, but I feel there are a couple characteristics here I'm growing tired of: onion and body odor in the IPAs - seems to be a palate trend for me lately unfortunately."
"Overall: 4.5-5"

"This beer was amazing. It had a really fresh grapefruit aroma that exploded out of the glass. I was amazed at the tasty freshness. I can't really put into words the actual taste of freshness, but it was such a clean IPA. The malt backed up the massive hops pretty well, although lets be honest with ourselves, this IPA is not so much about the malt. I would love to get my hands on more of this stuff. If I were to compare to Pliny, I would say they are actually quite similar, but more grapefruit on the Enjoy By and more tropical flavors in Pliny. Enjoy by July 4th is truly a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Move over Pliny, there's a new Sheriff in town. This is the freshest beer I have ever tasted. It is exactly what an IPA should be. It has a massive hop smell that hits you right in the face and does not let up one bit in the mouth. This tastes like liquid heaven for a fan of hops. The alcohol is very present, but that is no reason to apologize. This beer is not for the weak of mouth. The appearance is also amazing. This is probably the best looking beer I have ever seen in my glass. Get some!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"A great IPA but not quite as complex as I'd like. However, you can't really go wrong with a 9.4% abv beer that is this drinkable and delicious. While I prefer most of Alpine's IPAs, Sculpin, Yulesmith Summer, and even Stone's own Ruination to this, the availability of Enjoy By makes it a strong choice."
""
""
"OV: A very solid offering from Stone. Don't know if my opening this 21 days past the 'enjoy by' date had any effect on the quality of the beer. The tastes that were there were quality, but I was expecting a bit more from the aromas this gave off. And the body was lighter than I prefer."
"O: Tastes like Stone's interpretation of a by-the-book IPA (which means they said """let's make it a double.""") Imagine that Stone had a Pliny the Elder recipe in their hands and said """let's do this, but let's do it our way.""" It is a very well balanced brew that doesn't rely on extreme hops to define itself. It's a little different for Stone, and I'm glad I had it."

The alcohol is undetectable in the nose and palette. Any IPA lover will be in heaven with Enjoy By. Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA @ 9.4% ABV. Consumed 4/25/2013."

"Pours a very clear, straw color, decent head. The smell is strong and nice. All hops, with a touch of that oniony smell/flavor. This one leans away from the citrus side and goes more for the dankness. Taste is good, just like the smell. They did a really nice job of infusing the hop flavors into this beer. The hops are strong, but the beer is by no means bitter. Mouthfeel was good. Well carbonated, a bit of body. All in all, it's a very solid DIPA with great hop flavor, even though it's not quite the hop profile I would have gone for."

Really great DIPA....cant wait for the next edition!"

"Served in a tulip glass and enjoyed on 5/15/13. The appeared a nice deep amber color with a thick, rocky white head that was really well retained. The beer gave off an intense pine hop aroma with maybe a slight hint of citrus. The taste was very good...the hops, while very very upfront were not so overpowering that I was turned off by them, as happens occasionally with some DIPAs. This might be one of the best DIPAs that I have enjoyed. The beer felt good and the beer was smooth, but drinkability does suffer given the ABV. Overall, an excellent brew."

"Notes: Enjoy By 05/17/13. I really like the idea of a somewhat limited, very hoppy beer with a very clear date. Not something I will get all the time, but not something that will just sit around and take up space. This was well executed with the hops shining and the malt really just helping to showcase the hops. I really enjoy fruity, slightly sweet DIPAs and this hit the spot. Surprisingly light and easy to drink really paired well with the flavors. Lived up to the hype I was reading and definitely worth a try. Great treat for every now and then with no concerns about freshness."
" the carbonation is perfect, the taste is indescribable and the after taste just leaves me craving my next gulp! the most pleasant thing about this beer is that despite the alchohol % and i.b.u. this beer is sooo BALANCED.... its unbelievable. perfectly balanced. i had the 7th batch (enjoy by 5-17-13) keep more comming to MN stone!"

"A 5.17.13 edition thoroughly enjoyed on 5/3/13. (Also got some 10/25/13 with another great experience). Pours golden with a fluffy one finger head and perfect clarity. Beautiful aroma of floral grapefruit, pine, lemon zest, grass, wow. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Flavor is grassy pine and sweet citurs. Lighter flavor and mouthfeel than I expect from a top double, but incredibly easy drinking and makes this even better than I expected. Nice beer for sure, and so fresh!"
""
""
""
"Pours a slight amber/straw-like hue with a fluffy white head that lingers, giving way to a good amount of lacing. Distinct yeast smell right off the bat, followed up with the expected hop bomb aroma - dried grass, grapefruit rind, earthy and herbal. Taste is similar to the nose but even greater amounts of white grapefruit and black peppercorn that seamlessly lead into a sweet grainy, lightly boozy (not in a bad way) finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied (how one does this with a Double IPA clocking in at 9.4% ABV is beyond me ???). Carbonation is light, the finish is clean and smooth. Insanely well done IIPA - once again proving that Stone is the king of hoppy beers!"
""
"M: medium, lighter than expected, crisp, dry, bitter finish."
""
""
"It poured with a big frothy head that quickly dissipates. It has low retention and very little lacing. It has a bready aroma with big grapefruit notes. It tastes almost like it smells. Bready upfront and then turns to a grapefruit taste with a great finish. It has a decent body but I hoped it would be a little bigger and good carbonation that still tingles your tongue after you swallow. The fact that they hidnthe 9.5% abv makes this a great mouthfeel. This is a good beer and the one that had was from the 7th batch. It is the Enjoy By 5.17.13 and I enjoyed it on 5.11.13 so I was close to the expiration date. Good beer and I would like to try other batches."

"O - My first crack at an Enjoy By beer. It is a high quality IPA and worth a try for any hophead. If this is the new standard in fresh IPA's I'd say Stone has set a benchmark for others to reach."

"A very good and fresh Imperial/Double IPA from Stone. I had high hopes for this beer and it actually exceeded them. Would I drink it again? That's a stupid question! Of course I would! I hope I don't have to tell you this. Don't sit on this beer. Drink it fresh like the label says. You won't be sorry."

"Pungent hoppy aroma, not without some pale malts bleeding through. Flavor is big on bitter citrus rind, grapefruit pith and orange zest, vague traces of cantaloupe. Smooth with a hint of pale malt or wheat. Bitter hop resin sticks to the teeth a little. Medium bodied but fairly light for a DIPA. Overall very solid and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is clear golden orange with a fairly tight white head. Nose is hop forward with a light grain malt balance. Herbal and citrus hops with a touch of sticky resin behind. Taste is a huge hop punch and quite syrupy and resinous. Sticky feel, assertive carbonation balances, tons of citrus and grapefruit. Some bitterness in the finish that lingers a bit. Overall not bad, very syrupy and hop forward."

"O - Enjoy By is one of my favorite IPAs. It isn't the hop symphony that a beer like Heady Topper is, but Enjoy By really hits the hop appetite. I'm more of a bitter, dry tasting IPA guy, and Enjoy By certainly falls under this category. For me, it hits all the spots."

"Overall, if you like Sorachi Ace hops, you'll dig this beer. If not, you should probably pass. Personally I find it flavorful, unique and enjoyable. It is definitely different than many other stone offerings, and I'm interest to try my second bomber."
"Wow this beer is fresh! Lots of grapefruit and slight tropical fruits on.the nose. Taste matches the smell alot of grapefruit comes thru with some pine followed by a slghtly spicy finsh. Body is just a little thinner then other dipas. This is what a dipa should.taste like."

"Pours a clear gold with two finger thick dense creamy head. Thick rings down the glass. Smell: quick melon note, floral, grapefruit, pine, dried apricot, alcohol. Taste: fleeting biscuit and melon then big hop blast - pine, grapefruit peel, grassy. Oily into drying into sticky. Really good SD style DIPA. Thanks for sending this our way - probably the freshest Stone to hit FL."

"O Extremes all around. From the powerful aroma to the bitterness and warmth of the taste and aftertaste. I do not get much complexity in the taste. However that may not be the intended vision behind this beer. Good powerful West Coast slap in the face! I did enjoy this."
""
""
""
"D - Very nice, lots and lots of hop character in the aroma, the flavor is nice as well, but doesn't quite live up to the aroma. If there is any room for improvement it is that it is a touch too dry."
"Half finger bright white head on a slightly hazy golden with slight amber hue. Aroma is as good as it gets with full nose and all hop character varieties including citrus, herbal, earthy. Flavor is nicely complex and near perfectly hopped with pine, tart citrus, earthy hops. Only knock is just a little less malt presence but those that are there are musty and semisweet. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one is a little too dry but the aroma is excellent. Flavor doesn't quite live up to it being less complex and malty than I wanted but still very good."

"Appears to be an orange gold, clean beer, with a white pooofy top. Lace is gluey. Aroma is clean, orange soaked pulpy juicy layers, sweet deep spice, tea and nutmeg. Taste has a massive pile of orange, spice, and pine. Bursting with juiciness and flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy, dank, bitter. Body is big. Deceptively very delicately carbonated. Overall this beer is essentially a hop flavorfest and to no surprise another treat from Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly hazed golden orange colour, one finger of white head, good amount of lace on the glass. Huge citrus upfront, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango and a faint lemon, a bit of sweet honey dew like malt but certainly not shortage of hops in this. Taste is citrusy, grapefruit and pineapple, a bit of dank piney flavours, solid bitterness throughout , starts off dry and hoppy with a touch of sweet malts toward the end. Light dry carbonation, medium bodied and fairly oily as well. Just incredible stuff, cartainly something I would love to have again and again."

"Stone Enjoy By (batch 5/17/13) pours out a hazy golden color with a smaller head that retains very well. The nose is crazy hoppy. Tons of tropical and grapefruit hop flavors with an undertone of piney bitterness. The taste presents a literal ton of tropical fruit and grapefruit hops, with a strong hop resin aftertaste. One-note, but tasty as hell. The mouthfeel is on the light side and fairly carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Stone Enjoy By is an extremely tasty and enjoyable IPA. A little more depth to the hop blend would make it absolutely best in class, but as it is it's one of the best IPAs on the shelf for sure."
""
""
"Saw this in the store today and had to pick it up, given all the talk about this beer on BA. I must agree that it is most definitely an enjoyable IPA. However, I think it may be lacking some of the malt character that would balance this out a bit more. I would definitely drink this beer again, but I'm not going to replace all my DFH 90-min with this one."
"O: Great beer, love the freshness and the hoppiness. I will search and destroy all of the future releases of this. 4.5"
""
""
"I had the Enjoy By 05.17.13 and to be honest it was just good. I'd heard a ton about this beer and was really looking forward to this brew. Poured a bomber into a tulip, and the head dissipated rather quickly. The color was a perfect pale gold, and the head was a nice white/pale straw. The aroma didn't do much for me, a touch of spice, and sweet and earthy/flowery smell. The taste isn't as sweet as I was expecting and, although I appreciate west coast IPAs, this one didn't really have the malt character to balance out the appreciable hops. After all of that being said, I did enjoy this Enjoy By, and will probably pic up one of them again, but likely in late fall if they put one out around then."
"O - very good beer that I will seek out in future <FRESH> releases."
""
""
"With a robust addition of hops across a wide range of flavors, this is a great addition to the Stone family. I also appreciate their effort to encourage hoppy beers to be labeled fresh for immediate consumption."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My favorite IPA to date. Just an amazing beer."
""
""
"Poured into a large snifter glass. The beer pours clear orange golden with a thick, slowly retreating white head and lots of tiny streaming bubbles. The beer has a bright aroma of grapefruit, mango, and peach, but also hints of pine and sweet malt. Flavors of grapefruit, peach, mango hit the mouth up front with the piney bitterness hitting in the back. Further sips bring in more piney bitterness, though this is milder than some of the West Coast hop bombs, and more of that malt backbone. Make no mistake about this one. This is geared towards hop heads, so you're not going to find an extremely balanced IPA here. Still, the malt profile is bready and has light caramel sweetness. Because of the lack of malt balance, this is a bit thinner than many DIPAs. The body is medium and the carbonation is moderate. The finish is slightly dry and the hops provide plenty of aftertaste. The drinkability is very high since the alcohol can't be tasted. This is an excellent beer for what it is. I can admire what Stone is doing for the marketing gimmick, reminding people that beer should be enjoyed fresh."
"MUST HAVE; TREAT YOURSELF! (HOP HEADS SEEK THIS OUT!!)"
""
""
""
"O: Perhaps the beer that brings the issue of IPA freshness to the mainstream. Also a beautifully executed West Coast-style DIPA that's heavy on citrus aromas and light on malty sweetness. Not a terrible value at $7.49 and still very much around New Orleans in its second week since dropping."
""
""
"Not much head but a powerful smell. Like a weird cheese. Tastes like pungent cheese. You really can't drink other beer after this. Tried to have the Avery IPA as a second shift drink after this one and that excellent beer tasted like water. I must say I love this beer. Very powerful. Believe the hype?"
""
""
""
"O - Perhaps not my favorite hop profile, but there is a nice freshness to this one."
""
"O- Hard to imagine IPAs can get much better than this, though it's possible and I've witnessed it. Not the best of its kind, but it ranks up there with the other heavy hitters. Certainly the best DIPA Stone has ever made though, IMO."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber, 5/17/13, into a tulip. It pours a hazy gold with a 2 inch head, nice lacing. Lots of pine on the nose, notes of tropical fruit. The brew is full of bitter pine, notes of tropical fruit, lingering bitter finish. The beer is surprisingly easy drinking for such a big beer, good carbonation, full bodied. A good DIPA. Love the obvious freshness dating, but I think the beer is a bit overhyped."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is simply amazing, it is not only one of my favorite IPA's but a favorite beer period.... If you haven't had it you need to this beer is well deserving of the hype it has gotten."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm very impressed with this fresh DIPA offering from Stone. It's appetizing, rich, tasty, sweet and hoppy yet very easy to drink. This is a beer where the malt and hops are both present, making for rich complex flavours yet still crisp and refreshing (as opposed to a RIS or barleywine). I'm impressed and going to have to give Stone the due they deserve here. Tasty as heck. (4)"
"O: I'm quite impressed. The hop profile isn't my first choice, but the elements work in harmony. My first Enjoy By iteration, but hopefully it won't be the last. Excellent beer."
"O: I am not a huge IPA fan, though a double is better. I do have to say this is one of the better representations of the style. Stone always provides a quality product and this is no different. What really impresses me is the ability to weigh in at 9.4% without getting wacked up side the head with the alcohol taste. I will be back to hunt down the next batch."
""
""
"Overall - glad to have tried it and worth chasing down having missed it the last few go-rounds. but not one I would continue to pursue, unless of course they vary up the recipe each time, then it would be interesting to compare the different batches."
"Overall: This was an impressive beer from Stone. I thought it would be more bitter, like Ruination, but it had a nice sweetness to it that gave it balance. It was really easy to drink, more like an IPA than a double. Good stuff!"
""
"D/O: This is a solid DIPA with a modern hops profile. At almost 10% abv, this one is a sleeper that threatens to punish the overindulgent later. It masterfully keeps the hops qualities laser-focused on just the most appealing, never veering into the """kitchen-sink""" territory indicative of many over-the-top members of the style. Beers like this are going to eventually demand that all brewers of fine experimental pale ales update their recipes. A Centennial-heavy IPA just can't measure up to the apparently Simcoe/Galaxy/Citra foundation that is faithfully transmitted here. This is indistinguishable from Lagunitas Sucks, which actually puts this beer in a position to apologize for being stronger by almost 2%."
"O: Horribly enjoyable. So refreshing that you might mistake it for a session beer, but drink at your peril. I really liked this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Impressed... Props to Stone. I can't figure out if I like this or the Ruination 10th Anni better."
""
"Poured a clearish golden body body with orange tint with a two-finger head and lace thanks to extreme carbonation. Classic Stone IPA aroma of hops, hops and hops. Wet, soapy, lots of sharp citric with touches of grape and floral notes with minimal malt smells. Malts are more noticeable in the taste of this beer as it has a slight sweet edge, and in fact I notice that it seems to sweeten up a little more as it warms. Enjoyable beer (no pun intended), very crisp, dry finish, good balance, overall a hop lovers delight as it has a very strong hop presence with lots of citric and grapefruit flavors and even touches of sweeter fruits."
""
""
"Overall: The ABV in this hidden well and it will bite you in the ass if you aren't careful. To date this is the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, providing you don't let it warm too much. I will go back to Stone for this line again if they continue it."

"O: I've had this before on tap (the 4/1/13). It is an excellent DIPA, but I think I prefer it on tap. I actually shared a little less of half of this one for a friend's birthday. This beer really is just as I remember it, but that first time on tap seems to be a bit better. However, that could have been anything: a few days fresher, the physics of being on tap, the company/atmosphere, and even the nostalgia of it being my first time having it. I will say that this is one killer IPA that deserves its status, and is only like this because of the mandated freshness. It reminds me a lot of Burley Oak's Aboriginal Gangster, which is just a super local IPA that is always really fresh."
"O- A tremendous IIPA and different enough to be memorable in a crowded category."
"Pour is a yellow orange but look a bit light. An ok amount of head and lace, maybe a bit avg. The smell is phenomenal. Great hoppy smell that is not quite like any other double IPA. Maybe based on the the smell my expectations were extremely high. The taste was a very slight let down from the smell. Hoppy yet, not nearly what you would expect from the smell. The feel was a bit thin too. I felt like for this double IPA, the hoppy presence peeks very quick then fades into more of a watery mouthful. Overall, I do like this beer but was expecting more from it. It did fall short of being a world class beer but I still enjoyed it. I do have another bottle that I will try as the first beer of the evening to see if I've been thrown off by the other beers."

"Terrific stuff. Here I come, Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook."
"This is a general review. I don't want to get into the exact details. This beer is not jaw dropping. It is not a Pliny, Hopslam, or even a Nugget Nectur. But, this beer sends a message to IPA beer lovers. That message is freshness. While it is not anywhere near the best IPA I have ever tasted, it is one of the freshest and I think that this concept is missing. As a IPA drinker I have been feeling that sometimes I'm cheated. Nugget Nectur ( I consider this an IPA even though it is an IAPA) is one of my favorites, but I always feel like I have to buy it when it first comes out. If I don't, I run the risk of buying an old batch in which the hops are gone and it taste not the way it is intended. Ever wondered about the """create your own 6 pack""" special at some beer stores. Yea.. don't do it with IPAs because the single beers they sell in that form is always three months old. So... while it is not the best IPA, it is an IPA that I would rather drink than a 3 months old Hopslam. You have to respect a company that takes the quality of their beer seriously and that is why I will probably continue to wait and stalk a beer store for when they receive an """enjoy by.""""
""
"Overall: This was my first sample of the Enjoy By series and it blew my mind. This was just an incredibly beer by Stone, something I've come to expect from one of the best damn breweries in the country."
"Overall: While I enjoy IPAs, they're generally not one of my favorite styles. This beer could make me reconsider that stance. I had previously had the 12.21.12 and it seems as though the tropical fruit notes in this batch are not as prevalent. So while that does detract a little from its overall score, this is one of the best IPAs I've had and is definitely worth seeking out."
""

""
""
""

"Overall, a really tasty imperial IPA with a big, bitter hop bite. I like how it maintains the drier character of a lower ABV beer. Tons of flavor, but the sweetness and complexity of the hops are a bit overwhelmed by bitterness. I really appreciate the idea behind this beer and the beer itself is also very good."
""
"OOHFAH!!! this is where it is at man!!!"

"Absolutely delicious. And I love the concept of promoting fresh beer; most beers do not need to sit in your 55 degree closet. So happy to find this release here in VA. Thanks to Bon Vivant in Smithfield for stocking this."
"Edit: Had this on tap in Asheville and it was fantastic. Might have been a different bottling, might have been me."
""
""
"I'm not overly impressed with this IIPA. At $16/4-pack it's not at all worth it IMHO. I'll take Resin or Big A over this anyday of the week! Not bad, but not at all worth it either. Get on the hype train."
""

"The beer pours a beautiful golden orange with almost amber highlights. It pours with a half of a finger’s with head of pristine white, small bubbles that all sit as uniform in size, and stay the same height on the glass, but fad to a scrim in the middle of the beer. The head leaves a lacing of thick, creamy bubbles on the glass, forming fat waves on the sides. In body the beer is clean with a slight chill haze and lots of little bubbles gently working their way to the top of the beer. On the nose, the beer is pungent from the minute the bottle is cracked. This smell is everything I expect from Stone, with big sticky resin on the nose blending beautiful into tropical and stone fruit notes of mango, papaya, slight grapefruit, and a kiss of boozy malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly bitter with a nice kiss of sweet hops, a touch of sweet alcohol, and some slight acidity coming off the hops as well. The flavors begin as sweet mango and papaya, which are quickly blasted away by dank, resinous pine notes that smother the bitters gently across the palate and give the tongue a nice shiver. Pinecone flavors meld and overpower a slight sweet caramel touch, while stone fruit flavors and a touch of pineapple gel in the background of the flavor. The finish is long, smooth, and bitter with medicinal and pine flavoring that works into the aftertaste of bitter resin, though the finish does showcase a hiccup of sweet and almost cloying caramel malt. In the mouth, the beer feels surprisingly fat and syrupy, coming in on the heavier side in body with a smooth and sticky carbonation that oozes the beer over the tastes buds. The mouth is left wet on the sides with a light dryness traveling up the middle of the tongue. Overall, this is good DIPA, and I didn’t expect anything else from Stone. It could use a touch more dryness to it, as the alcohol and sweet hops do provide hiccups of cloying sugar on the tongue and stomach, but overall, this is a beautiful expression of hops. The hop character is deeply complex and nuanced, revealing new flavors to the palate with every sip. It does sit a little thick in the stomach, though, and is definitely more of a sipper, but all in all this is a damn good DIPA with a great message about the life of hoppy flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really great IPA and a great concept. Tons and tons of hop juicyness without any intense bitterness. I hope they continue producing this and keep it relatively easy to get."

"O: absolutely happy with Stone with this one. A very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA, especially on a warm spring day. Nothing too unique compared to heady or Lawson's (i know, I know...) but would absolutely recommend to a fan of sticky, citrusy DIPAs."
""
""
""
"Overall - buy this, drink it, enjoy it. A MUST have for hop enthusiasts"
"A truly outstanding DIPA, head and shoulders above Ruination. Stone reasserts their cred when it comes to IPAs."
"Overall an awesome beer. Super fresh and super delicious. My only """complaint""" (not really a complaint just a comment) is that for a beer that advertises itself as super fresh and hoppy, it could be a bit more of a hop bomb. Compared to something like heady, the hop profile is not that insane. Still and amazing beer though."
""

""
""
"This is more than a beer; it is a work of art. Such aggressive flavors yet such perfect balance and light, crisp, refreshing feel. I could drink this all day if it wasn't 9.4% abv. I love the combination of Midwest and West coast hop flavors. I also love the fresh IPA concept and if the name hadn't caught my eye, I probably wouldn't have bought it. Well-done."
""
"The appearance was a transparent amber haze, and the smell was pure hops- very forest like. The taste was good like I said refreshing, tingling the taste buds wanting more. The mouthfeel did have an odd but refining quality, but the after taste was lingering one that wouldn't go away even after popcorn. All and all, decent, get it if you can, I'd give it a 93/100"

"look is a light golden yellow-orange, clear, with a wonderful pillowey head. smell is piney, musty, """green""" smelling, with a kick of citrus at the end. malt and grain taste musty, with a honey-like sweetness. hops are a little flat - crushingly bitter musty pine, with a lemon pledge kick."

"Gotta love the concept of deliberately ensuring a DIPA be enjoyed fresh, and this freshness is devilishly evident. Poured from a bomber bottle of Enjoy By 5-17-13 into a tulip. Inviting amber appearance with a sizable white head. Big hoppy and citrusy aroma. Taste follows the nose and is hop forward, leaving a syrupy bitter resin stickiness lingering on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, clean mouthfeel. Great carbonation really drives the flavor in this one. A wallop of fresh citrus washes over the palate. Grapefruit, passionfruit, orange - with a really sweet finish. Bitterness is there, but this is so fresh and flavorful, that the bitterness is tamed down in a way. This is dangerously drinkable. One of the best DIPAs I've had the pleasure of having. Keep sending these to NC!!"

"Stone should keep doing this with limited batches of beer. It might make more sense and cut back on the beer that lingers on shelves for months. They have the beer dating thing down pat and detailed info on the batches."
"Had this rated close to a 5 until I tried the 12.26.14 version... really didn't hit the spot for me. Don't know why it wasn't so bright and vibrant like the other versions I've had. Maybe this was a fluke and didn't turn out the way they intended."

"Overall this is a fantastic DIPA, prob in my top 5. I need to get my hands on another bottle this week if I can--absolutely a great fresh brew."
"O - This beer laces the glass like no other. Very bitter, but not quite as hoppy as expected. It's bitterness is at 88 IBUs, which is pretty high, but I've definitely had bitter-er (is that a word?) beers. Overall a great IPA, but I feel a little disappointed considering the amount of effort it took to hunt it down (in Chicago, the place where rare beers can easily be found if you look in the right places). Either way, if I ever see it again, I'd pick it up, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find. Cheers."

"Amazingly fresh, Stone Enjoy By 4-20-13 pours a beautiful honey-golden color with a touch of amber in there as well. An inch or so of white head caps the brew, and it slowly dissipates while leaving a ton of sticky lacing. Hops aromas burst from the glass. Citrus, pine resin, and freshly mowed grass provide a dominate hop presence in the nose, with just a touch of burnt toast providing any malty hints. Fruity citrus flavors, as well as caramel malt sweetness open up on the palate as floral hop flavors, and a bit of pine resin pull through the finish. The sweet malt flavors provide excellent balance. This amazingly fresh and tasty brew is medium in both body and carbonation. The next batch out is 5-17-13, get your hands on this amazing Imperial IPA!!"
"This one, for me, is better than the sum of the parts. Not a """well blow me down""" experience, but a very enjoyable beer. I really like the decreased intensity and it crosses into a complex big beer that drinks nicely."

"Enjoy By 05-17-13: What a nice IPA, crisp, perfect for a Spring day evening. Not technical, but just a note to say I enjoyed the beer. I'm surprised to find it in the local wine store, but they had a couple of cases that came in yesterday (unannounced, of course), so I grabbed a case and will finish it by the date. High ABV, so my score may be skewed."
"Some 30 minutes after the initial pour, the added warmth has given the nose some sticky sweetness. At the outset, this DIPA was quite jagged and the pine resin quite pronounced. With some warmth, sweetness is more evident and things are more balanced overall. This really is quite good."

"Medium bodied, above average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Finishes somewhat dry, and the 9.40 % abv is hidden very well. This is an excellent Imperial IPA, well worth waiting for."
""
""
"O: HOPS dominate, malt takes a back seat, it is delicious though"
""
""
"Overall: Little doubt at this point that these Best By IPAs by Stone are the real deal, no gimmicks here. Having this beer reminded me of my first experience with IPAs when I was getting into craft beer (the Stone IPA), felt like firecrackers going on in my mouth. So many things going here, just oustanding. Credit to Stone for continuing to be innovators in the field and just another example of their masterful craftsmanship."
""
""
""
""

"Must try if you call yourself a hophead."

"O - Great job Stone Brewing. I'll be seeking this beer out with each release date. Its a very easy sipping double IPA. Doesnt get much better!"

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: This beer masks its 9.4% ABV very well. Dangerously drinkable for a double IPA. And for a 10 day old bottled beer? That's a great win for fresh beer as time is usually not the friend of IPA's. This beer is quite delicious and I had the foresight to purchase 2 more bottles. The aroma of this Stone beer is just phenomenal."

"Enjoy By was enjoyable, wish I could of had it fresher. Good hop profile with a nice light malt base."
""
""
"The taste is really complex , not too bitter , starts off with a hoppy flavor with the malty sweetness hitting in the middle with the booze finishing off at the end , not too sweet , not too hoppy and the booze isn't too over powering. This is a really great beer and I will be buying more of it"

"O - The last batch (and first) I had of this was back in December and it really surprised me. This batch did exactly the same. This beer is amazing. Fresh, easy to drink and well balanced. Well done Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Another good IPA from Stone. This is a fun series and I ask myself whether any of the collectors are putting together verticals of this bad boy. I would like to see a little more malt presence here so as to add another dimension to the beer, but the hop profile is quite lovely as the centerpiece anyways. High quality and would gladly drink again. Cheers vissai."

""
""
""

"Stone has really outdid themselves with this beer. In my opinion, they're really competing with RR for the best west coast DIPA - this beer deserves a spot at the top. The hop presence is bold and intense, but not cloying. They work intricately to create a balanced and tasty beer. If you can't get your hands on Pliny or Heady, try this one. A notch above PtE and a hair below Heady Topper. Must try."
""
"O: This version is different from the others and have to say i prefer the citrus juicy hops but this beer is very good. The most impressive aspect is definitely how clean it looks, tastes, and feels it is competitive with the big boys like pliny but not as good for sure. It is however a very solid DIPA if you enjoy palate wrecking hop bitterness definitely try this but if IPAs aren't your thing stay away and drink it fresh as this is gonna be a malt bomb fast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Honestly to see all the hype I am disappointed in this beer. Don't get me wrong this is def a good beer, but I'm not buying into this brewed to be extra fresh crap. The beer pours average, no exciting appearance, nothing special with the head. The aroma is quite unique though. It has the basics of a West Coast IPA but more, there seems to be tons of varieties of hops, very complex. This strong hop flavor makes you forget it's over 9% abv. Although I appreciate all these hops, I feel like they could have been chosen differently to better compliment each other. All in all my opinion breaks down to this. Every other type of IPA I have had from Stone Brewing has been better than this beer, and they are all half the price. I was super excited to try this been and unfortunately I was disappointed. Save your money and buy the original Stone IPA, it is the better way to go."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A pretty awesome IPA. If you like hops and lots of 'em, this beer doesn't disappoint."
""
""
"Overall – This beer packs a punch in both booze and hops. It's missing just a bit of the limp smacking sweetness that I find in Sculpin/pliny, but it's still a world class beer for sure. There is no reason to buy ruination if this is sitting on the shelf as well."
""
""
""
"Taste-Fruity peach and apricot, piney, resinous hops abound. Grapefruit, fresh-squeezed hops. High ABV not evident. Full-on hops, big character and bigger flavor. A powerfull, full-flavored Double IPA."
""
""
"O- Overall this is one of the best imperial IPA's I have ever had. I bought an 8 oz. snifter of the 04/20/13 on tap at a restaurant earlier this year on a whim and I loved it. This is the first time I had it since then and perhaps the first IIPA I have had since then as well. This beer is surprisingly refreshing and the alcohol is hidden very well. It CAN NOT BE TASTED AT ALL! For a brew approaching 10% that is very impressive. I have had some really HOT brews at 9-10%. Not this beer. I strongly recommend this to hop heads and anyone who is a craft beer aficionado in general as this is not a harsh IIPA. Bold, vivid in flavor-yes, but not harsh in alcohol or hops whatsoever-a WORLD CLASS BEER!"
""
""
"This poured very nicely, with good head retention, and a nice coppery color. from there I got a floral hop aroma and some caramel notes. Flavor was fine. Standard high-hopped American IPA. This was an OK beer for me, but I'm not sure what the fuss is. I wonder if some of the oooh and ahhh might be because in general Stone makes great beer. This is not a great beer. It's a good beer, in the current tradition of """more hops = better beer.""" I went from this one to a Bear Republic Racer 5, which I love."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a pretty kick ass beer. Gives Pliny a run for it's money, and might even be better."
""
""
""
""

"I like the idea of this beer suggesting a 'fresh by' date. I just made it with the bottle I had."

""

""
""
""
""
"Edit #2 - Revisiting my original review a year later with the 04.20.14 bottling. More dank and herbs and just fabulous melding of flavors. Upticking a few points."
"Overall, this is one of the best double IPA's on the market. And the fact it's label alone keeps it fresh is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is just a perfect tone of liquid gold in tone. Head is a thick fluffy two fingers of off white rocky foam. It has nice retention and fades leaving random waves of lace. Nose is bright and invigorating with notes of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine resin. The pineapple plays big time with the first sip yielding a big juicy citrus based profile. This really is a beer that I could drink all night, so easy its scary for 9.4% alcohol. Just the right amount of bitter, flavor and balance makes this a wonderful IPA. I really cant wait to get more of this next time it comes around."
""
""
"O: I am definitely not a hop-head but I had to try this beer after hearing so much about it. Overall, I'm happy with it. What impresses me the most is the complicated hop flavor of this beer. Most DIPA's are strongly bitter....and that's it. This beer, while definitely bitter, is not nearly as harshly bitter as most DIPAs. The hop characteristic in particular is more complex than expected - fruity and floral with a nice resin base. I find DIPAs disappointingly one-note - I think this is the first that I would buy again. Nice job Stone."
""
""
"O: Excellent stuff - this is a true hop-lover's dream. Dank and tasty."
""
""
""
"Overall, really good. Glad I got to try this one."
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): I really love this beer and would gladly buy 10 more bottles of it if I could. It's what fresh IPA is all about–the bitterness, the citric bite, the dry finish, the drinkability and refreshing qualities...they're all here in spades. I would love to have this beer even earlier in its life. Maybe next time a batch comes to Illinois or Massachusetts. Until next time, remember friends: drink it fresh."

"batch 5- Enjoy by 4/1/13. What a delightful beer- I really love the whole idea of the lengths they've gone to encourage freshness in an IPA. Nothing like a fresh IPA! Wonderful delicate floral aroma with some citrus blossom and a touch of floral honey. The taste is beautifully balanced with citrus, floral, herbal, and a touch of pine in the finish. Vibrant and fresh tasting with just enough sweetness to keep things zippy. A touch soft, but just a great beer all around."

"O/D - A very worthy beer. Hides its strong nature very well. Certainly accentuates the fresh hops. Not sure it brings out anything new for me however."
""
"Prost!"
"Overall this stuff wasn't quite what I was expecting, but pretty good anyway, as are all of Stone's brews. Working in shipping, I can appreciate the logistics of the beers concept, but wouldn't advise ordering one for 10$ (and then $20 for shipping) online like I did. I'm not sure it will ever come to my region, so I'll probably have to start trading if I want another, in which case I'd recommend it. Really glad I finally got to try this"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it seems that every batch just gets better and better I have not gotten my hands on the latest 4-20-13 batch but I have one bottle of the 4-1-13 batch that I'm saving for the day before the enjoy by date to really wait to the last minute to see how much it changes. If u haven't had it yet what are u waiting for? Amazing!"
""
""
"An outstanding beer and what I expect from Stone!"
"O - An excellent beer, and a worthy experiment by Stone."
""
""
""
"Too cold today, need to tone down the fridge. Big pretty head anyway. Smell is muted (but I'm blaming temperature). Still delicious. Fruity. Resinous."
""
""
"Overall an excellent double ipa. Worth seeking out."
"Overall- Very well balanced. The freshness is so apparent. All the flavors are so vibrant and pronounced. It feels like the flavors are wrestling in your mouth for your attention. Your mouth tingles with hoppy bitterness after. Dare I say my favorite IPA. . . so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am as surprised as anyone when I say this is rather muted. Certainly a good citrus, piny hop kick. Though not near what I was expecting from Stone. Which to me is a good thing. That, or Stone is responsible for dulling even the stingiest of non hop heads tastes. Joking aside, this is a good beer."
"O: Another tasty brew from Stone. Well made, focused, and definitely drinkable."
""
"O – Great IIPA, seriously, freshness matters and drinking this just five days after bottling is awesome. This one has no cloying malt sweetness, it has a nice, juicy, clean hop profile, and is highly drinkable."
"My only disappointment was that the liquor store limited sales to just one bottle per customer. My bottle was gone in a flash."
""
""
""
""
""
" Appearance is very nice in this double IPA at 9.4 abv.Pours somewhat cloudy body, with a thick lacing 2 finger head; shiny penny tone(new copper).Smells of """sour-diesel"""/piney scent. Nice fresh aroma of hops bitter notes. Skunky in flavor up front, with cherry and white grapes on the stringent finish. Pine-tar like consistency on the palate, and a lingering hoppy dry,almost rubber essenece on the finish. Overall, I like this hop bomb, from one of the Masters in the game. Green is written all over this one!"
""
"pretty close to the bud--liquid style--THANKS---mike---"
"O: Great beer. I'll pick up a bottle again if I see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad that I purchased two of these and looking forward to having it again. This, for me, was really a stand out of all the Stone beers that I have had over the years. Well done, and cheers to Stone. Keep sending them to Texas."
"M&D&O - Yes! More please! A fantastic DIPA. Hop bombs like this rarely have this kind of balance. Try this if you can."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I had this on tap about a week ago and enjoyed it much more than I'm feeling this bottle at the moment- I'm thinking it's just a bit undercarbonated. As it sits it's a better-than-average DIPA and it's well marketed, but it's just not capturing my attention. High price point, not quite as good as the Nugget leaves me wishing for more. Worth trying, nice to see a national release like this. I'd probably buy it again."
""
""
"Poured on tap as well as bottle. Pours clean gold with a healthy white head along with beautiful fresh lacing that lasts well throughout. Aroma is a nice grapefruit, citrus and floral scent. Flavor is a complete hop explosion, citrus, grapefruit, really nice floral bittering hops also, very subtle malt backbone. Definitely a nice and fresh hoppy IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- definitely one of the fresher hop flavors I've had, quite fitting for this beer. All hops take center stage, just a bit of nutty malt noticeable. Pleasing finish with a refreshing, lingering grassy bitterness. Very solid DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a perfect example of a West Coast style IPA. The tropical hop notes combined with the pine and resin make this one an excellent offering. It's probably the best hoppy beer from Stone and one I hope they decide to make year-round, mainly because its a great value at $5.99. It's so close to the other great IPAs (Alpine, Pliny, Heady etc) but just not quite there. 4.5"
"Overall: here at the bar enjoying one of the best """new""" imperial IPAs I have had in a long time. Little expensive but honestly I have had so many DIPAs that this seems priceless. Salud!"

"First review: t'was (currently tipsy, felling pretentious) an excellent demonstration of flavor 'complexity'... Swish it in your mouth and taste the changes! This is one of those that changes with temperature, and has an evolving aftertaste. 6th batch was indeedly a treat; smelled and tasted herbal... Basil/rosemary/other garden thangs. I'm wondering if there is any legitimacy to the drink by date-or just newly minted marketing majors making a stamp on the craftbeer scene. I'm visiting the northeast this weekend, but wish it were available back in Lousiana where I'm working. Strong work Stone."

"This beer makes me want to go back to San Diego. Each sip reminds me of the great time and IPAs I had there. Impressive hidden ABV, feels so smooth like it could be 4%."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A great DIPA from Stone, arguably of their best hoppy beers to date. It's a very boozy, but has a great hop profile. So happy to see this beer as a regular brew, if only they would bring back Ruination 10th Anniversary. A hop heads dream beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is easily one of the best IPAs on the market, though it should be made clear that it’s definitely not for the faint of heart: there’s more hop goodness in one bottle of this stuff than in a truckload of anything Anheuser-Busch produces, and the sheer intensity of the flavors will probably be unpalatable for anyone who can’t even stand a more friendly IPA. But if you’re a hophead, this must be on your must-try list. Excellent fare."

"GROUPIE ROUND: Enjoy By 07.04.14 bomber; after trying this for the past year I can conclude that this is one of the best beers ever made. Need to try Pliney The Younger and Double Sunshine IPA in hopes of having something better, but besides Heady Topper I've never had a fresher tasting DIPA that was smooth and ridiculously easy to drink with great balance, fresh complicated hop/citrus flavors and a nose so wonderful. This always delivers, one of the all time greats."
"O-Solid and balanced IPA that is extremely drinkable, although the abv will keep you from having more than one"
""
""
"O: Not too shabby, although I'll be honest... I was expecting something more along the lines of Ruination. That being said, this is still a really nice DIPA. It's not super bitter or dry, which helps its drinkability. Would love to have it again, if it comes around!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, wow. An excellent beer, on par or better than their IPA specialty neighbors Alpine which is high praise. Well done Stone."
""
""
""
"Overall - Easily the best IPA I've had. Pick some up if you get a chance. The local liquor store limits these to 1 per customer due to scarcity--now I understand why."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. Dry, complex, hop-centric profile with excellent drinkability. One of Stone's best offerings. I sure hope they continue to make these for upcoming summer nights."
""
"Third: 09-13-13 edition, 22oz bomber, not as tasty as the """straight from the brewery""" taste I enjoyed in August, but still an the best IPA I've had!"
""
"Overall, another great IIPA from stone. I love the drinkablity and the unique hop combination of this brew and am really glad I picked it up."
""
""
"I can appreciate this for all the character it possesses even if it is not necessarily my cup of beer."
""
""
"O: I really thought this was going to be a world-class DIPA, but instead I find it kind of harsh and meh. I hate to say it, but this has nothing on some of the local DIPAs I can get fairly readily (Evolution Lot 6 DIPA and Troegs Perpetual IPA); and let's not talk about how badly Lagunitas Sucks pounds this one into submission. Absolutely worth trying, though - hell, I seem to be only one who doesn't love this. But Stone, unless the second bottle I drink manages to make me shit out rainbows and sunshine the way I expected this one to, you are back on my naughty list again."
""
""
""
"O – This is not the first Enjoy By I’ve had as its come around my area twice now. I regret not reviewing it the first time as I thought that batch was significantly better. Part of me is really disappointed by the inconsistency I perceive from batch to batch, but the other part of me is loving the brilliance and the quality of this beer. The idea of dating the beers like this is brilliant and I will continue to buy them every chance get because I will always know how old they are without digging for the date. Well done Stone!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one got much better as it warmed up and more flavors started to pull through. I was however slightly let down by this one especially with all the hype around it. I thought it was an excellent beer, but (and I hate to make comparisons) I prefer a DIPA like Sucks for the immense drinability and tropical flavors to the more resinous/dank that Enjoy By has. That being said, brilliant idea by Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice IPA...I will enjoy by 4-1.13 as often as I can."
"O - I had this on tap and noticed a lot more grapefruit. The bottle seems to have more bitterness, especially on the finish. It has a lot of flavor and is good, but not necessarily my favorite of all time."
""
"O – This is an awesome DIPA from Stone. It is not only delicious, but is also dangerously drinkable given the ABV. I’m so glad I finally got to try a beer from this series. It was worth the wait."
""
""
"4/20/15: bottle says """devastatingly DANK""". light in color.  head dissipates quickly.   the typical pine on the nose.  nice maltiness, not a ton of pine in flavor.  sweetness gives way to very little on the end.  not much bitterness."
""
"On tap at 2 Bros in Salem Ct. Enjoy by 4-01-13. Pours a murky burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is hoppy with some sweet citrus and tropical fruits. The taste is more of the same sweet citrus and tropical fruits but some pine as well. Good amount of bitterness. Some malt flavor but this one if hop forward for sure. Creamy ,heavy mouthfeel. A bit reminiscent of Ruination. Overall, this is a damn fine Imperial with that typical Stone taste. Glad I got a chance to try it."
""
"Enjoy By 04.01.13"
""
""
"O- Will wait until closer to the enjoy by date for the next one feel like the beer was perhaps still a little disjointed would love to get a rounder feel from the malt bill which felt a bit obtuse and not yet fully settled in the bottle (is bottle shock possible in beer like wine- this is what i feel may have been going on here). Very Good, about on par with a Green Flash Imperial..."
""
"O - I love the gimmick, I think it's got a good message. Some of the fruitier tones are somewhat diminished by the rubbery tones. I like the strong booze presence, but it doesn't benefit the taste in any significant way. Enjoy By is good, definitely worth <$8 /bomber, but not any more than that."
"O - Great IIPA, one of my favorites. Love the concept of """Enjoy By""""
""
""

"O - I've never been a huge fan of Stone's stuff because the taste of the majority of their beers are very overpowering to the point where I can't drink it comfortably. This one, however, is completely different. Very easy to drink yet still maintaining that strengthness thats become a hallmark of Stone. A complex mixture of flavors going back and forth with each sip. Excellent beer and very well balanced. I really love this beer. I had it on tap in Waterbury, VT and it was just as delicious and refreshing as the bottle. Complete success with this beer."
"Fifth batch, 4.1.13. Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-orange coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a thin, filmy, bright white head that recedes into a surface coat that clings to everything it touches. Aromas of resiny and piney hops fill your nose on every sniff. Tropical fruit and grapefruit sweet and tart ribbon through the aromas, also. Smells green and tasty. Flavors are amazingly balanced. Green, resiny, hoppy punch initially, with a dose of bitterness that quickly washes into a tropical fruit blend of mango and grapefruit. Resiny and bitter at the end of the palate, with a slightly roasty and tangy sweet caramel backbone coming through. Hoppy and peppery spiced aftertaste, with a bitter feel that leads to the clean, dry finish. Smooth and clean in mouth. This beer is tremendous."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great DIPA by stone. Better than 10th anni Ruination? Not a chance. A very good beer none the less. Also, a very cool concept for beers that need to be consumed fresh. If it ever stayed on the shelves long enough, it would drive stores to dispose of old IPAs"
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clear yellow color with a white head on top. The retention was good as well as the lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is loaded with fresh hop aromas, big floral and citrus notes with a subtle malt sweetness in there as well. The taste of the beer is very good as well. The malt balances the bitter hops quite well giving this more of a sessionable flavor in my opinion. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth with a bit of oiliness to it. Overall I wasn't thinking this was an Imperial IPA, I was thinking it was just an amped up standard IPA. All in all it's a good brew and I'm glad to have tried it. Worth checking out if you want a quality brew."

"Had this on draft a few months ago and wasn't overly impressed. Picked up the bottle version for a second try and was a bit more impressed, though not blown away. Pours a beautiful copper color with a moderate head. smell is HOPPY. to be expected from a 10 day old beer. Taste is the normal west coast DIPA taste...very bitter and very hoppy. Enjoyable. Moderately carbonated. Overall not a world class brew as others would have you believe, but worth picking up and trying if you see it. I prefer Stone's regular IPA, Cali-Belgique and Ruination to this one."
"Stone's best hoppy beer, in my opinion."

"This beer exudes nuanced, well balanced flavors that just ride on and on. It is very tasty and the ABV at 9.4 is hardly noticeable, so it could pull you under quicker than a rip tide. I definitely want some more, but this is a beer that is best consumed in moderation with food and friends."
""
""
"Taste actually starts out with cookie-ish, fruity malts. Light toasted edge. Herbal, numbing hop bitterness quickly ekes in, but then big tropical fruit hop notes take over. Pineapple, mango, and mandarin orange stick out. Undercurrents of grapefruit and citrus peel. All this hoppy goodness sits over a solid bedrock of fruity sweet malt. Still, this is definitely a hop-forward beer. Finish dries out some, with lingering notes of tropical fruits, pine, and spicy alcohol. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Very drinkable; I just wish I had more :)."
""
"O: Overall this is a nice beer, but I'd rather drink a regular Ruination. It's certainly not up to the standards of Ruination 10th Anniversiary. Good, but not worth the hunt IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Hop heaven. Lots of citrus. Lots of sweet and salty pine. Superb balance between all. Lasting flavor. The only indicator that this is a iipa is the mild burn I get on the back of my palate. This defines what an excellent beer is and should be. Big time kudos to Stone for this one. Worth a drive or a trip to get to try."

"Enjoy By 09.13.13: I was afraid I was going to rehype this too much for myself, and set myself up for disappointment, but it was just as good as I remember it. Amazing beer, and the smell is simply exquisite. Freshest hops of any brew I can think of."
"O: This beer is WAY too easy to drink for a DIPA, and it will always be fresh. Props to Stone for really making it clear when to drink this beer, aka RIGHT NOW! Don't hesitate buying this beer whenever you see it, as you won't be let down"
"But however it compares, I love it."

"O: a delicious IPA overall. Lots of juicy and dank hop notes."
"Very clean, golden color with a great head on top at first. sticky and gummy lacing on down the glass. Big and fat hop aroma right in your face. Grassy as all get out. Massive flavor assault in both malt and hops. Freshly mown grass, papaya, citrus with a touch of sugary sweetness. Really could not get any fresher. Excellent mouthfeel-just a huge body that is very well balanced against the enormous flavor. WOW! what a great beer all in. Reminds me of Moylan's Hopsickle just picked off the bine. Just killer all in. Had no idea about this beer until the guy in my local turned me on to it. Well worth finding, having and enjoying over and over and over...."
"Overall: Glad to have snagged a bottle from the release (4/1/13) that made it to NC; really tasty and avoids the stickiness that I have encountered with some other beers brewed by Stone"

"O- damn this is good stuff, it's very drinkable for the style, not syrupy, not bitter, just refreshing. I hesitate opening beers so its nice to have one that demands I pop it open. If you're lucky enough to get one, buy as many as you can.... And then plaster it all over social media."

"O: Overall, this is a great DIPA. Im so glad the guys at my local bottle shop made me aware that there were a couple of these in the back! Just another beer to add to the list of great hoppy offerings from Stone. Im really not sure if anyone does hoppy beers better than these guys. Consistently pumping out great beers like Stone does is impressive. Looking forward to drinking this again in the future."
""
""
"A very good beer and devastatingly fresh. Very tasty, but falls far short of the hype it gets. Fresh Ruination is better than this (and the Ruination 10th Anniversary Ale Stone released completely blows this stuff away)."
""
""
""
"Very nice, but I'll probably stick with Ruination and Sublimely Self Righteous due to cost and availability. Great hop-forward DIPA though."
"It's about time a craft brewer really focused on the freshness of hops and really pushed the process of keeping ipas fresh to their distributors. Enjoy by is a top notch hop bomb, aroma is stellar, the taste is very dank and pine heavy, terrific DIPA. The best I've had from them thus far."
""
" Just another outstanding effort by Stone. These guys are world class for a reason folks."
"O- I completely applaud stones enjoy by concept. While this was not my preferred hoppy presentation of a DIPA, it was still enjoyable. Thankful for the opportunity to try this"
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grass, grass hop, citrus hop, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grass hop, grass, onion hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one had a pretty big explosion of hops going on here while still managing to be refreshing. There was quite a nice balance here as well. The aroma is quite inviting and the flavor has just enough hoppy resin in it to remind you of the style it falls under. A really well done brew that I would definitely have again."
""
"22 ounce bottle, Enjoy By 04.01.13. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit) and pine hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some lemon peel, floral hops and a bit of onion. There's an enjoyable bitter hoppy finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and sticky with moderate carbonation. It's also easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew overall, I hope Stone keeps making it (and Ohio keeps getting some). $6.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
"O- Way too much onion, I won't be coming back for more. Bring back Stone Ruination 10th Anniversary :(."
""
"O- Love the Enjoy By series. Always fresh, and never ceases to impress the masses. I always look forward to grabbing a few bottles of this when it comes around."
""
"This is an excellent beer overall and a top tier DIPA. It's extremely hop forward with enough malt to make it relatively balanced. Definitely a beer I'd like to see much more often, if not regularly."
""
""
""
"O - This beer starts fantastic and gets better as you go. Great flavor and incredible mouthfeel. Well worth the hype."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great IIPA. It is one of the most hoppy and bitter beers I've tried. I was expecting it to be more tropical, similar to Hopslam and Sucks but it was not very much like them at all. This is a hop lovers dream as it is in your face. This is a great beer, don't get me wrong, but given the price at about $8.60 a bomber, I think I will stick to Lagunitas Sucks at around $10 a sixer."
"Overall - BOOM. Stone's best brew to date."
"Possibly the best beer Stone had come up with. Someone told me this was a Pliny clone, as Stone distributed for Russian river in ca, but its got its own groove. Same West Coast style, but definitely unique."
""
"Update: 9/13/13 on draft...awesome! Massively bitter, huge hop aroma and flavor, dry, not much of an alcohol presence...everything a hop bomb should be."
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a well-above-average DIPA, no question there. And it definitely delivers what it promises: the short shelf-life flavor and aroma hopping is here in spades, but I’m surprised at how little bitterness there is. Compare this to Ruination, for example, and the difference is clear as day. But this beer is very, very good, and I’m glad to have tried it. And super kudos to Stone for latching onto an idea (with the freshness initiative, as it were) and running with it to its logical extreme—who else would do that so well?"
"The beer pours a clear, slightly coppery golden yellow with sticky white inch of head. The nose is potent citrus hops with a hint of grain sweetness and booze. The beer drinks very easily, like sugar dusted citrusy hops and has a mild, lingering grapefruit rind bitterness. It's certainly not drinking like a heavy IPA...as I'd expected with a 9.4% abv beer. The beer has near perfect balance, which is also surprising, as the intense hops and booze tame the sweet maltiness...or vice versa. Great IPA that drinks very easily and definitely hits the spot."
"Overall-One thing stone does right, their beer is bold and feels bold. It might not be the tastiest double out their but it holds it own. Where this beer really leads the pack is in the mouthfeel, its thick, hoppy, and bitter, the three things I want in a double. DIPA's are supposed to be juggernauts and this one is. 4.5"

"this is an enjoy before 04.01.13. this is the first time i have had an """enjoy by""" ipa from stone. i like it. the color is a crisp clear golden. smells super hoppy. the taste is super crisp and really hoppy, a lot of citrus and pine. there are times when i crave an ipa... this one hits it out of the park. i wish it was more available."
""
"Overall: Phenomenal. The best way to describe it is Hopslam with more bittering hops."
""
"Excellent IPA. Gotta go get some more."
""
"Enjoy by 04/01/13.Pours a clear medium golden with a large blooming white crown that is just billowing and never really comes down,it sticks like glue to the sides of the impy nonic I poured it in.Hop complexity to the hilt,resiny,piney,and the sweet onion notes abound,mild biscuit malts are noticable.Leafy and real minty hops stand out up front on the palate,again Iam getting some thin slice red onion in there,Iam guessing Summit hops used?It's fresh tasting and has your not so typical hop flavors,interesting and damn good."

"Very juicy, spicy hop aroma with some sticky pine sap and a subtle biscuit note. Super citrusy hop bomb flavor. Fructose sweetness and some resin. Light on carbonation, dry, and warming deep down."

"Enjoy by 4/1/13 is one of the easiest drinking double IPA i've had the privilege of encountering. Appearance is a golden/brassy blond, with smallish bubbles and little head. This might be due to the fact i bought a second growler to enjoy today following my first liter on the release day. The aroma is outstanding; floral, herbal hops with hints of tropical fruit lingering in the back. This is a fresh IPA to be sure. More tropical notes and some citrus across the palate, and a fine balance between bitterness and maltiness. The 9.4% is completely hidden until you've had a few pours! I love the fact you can detect the potent hop aromas before the glass is in your face. Solid, solid piece of brewing."
""
""
"O - I have never been disappointed in a Stone product, even those that have been backed by incredible hype. This beer follows that same trend. Overall, this is one of the better IPAs I have had. Hoping to receive another shipment to VA!"
""
"O- this beer isnt a palatte ruiner like its older brother ruination. this beer is a palette assassin. your palate is gonna be finished before it even knew what hit it. having just had tried the younger 8 days ago i have to say, at this point, i think i prefer this beer over PtY."
"O: Big hop bomb, exactly what I was expecting from stone. A bit unbalanced and a bit boozy but is played off well. If you're a fan of DIPAs, give this a shot."
""
""
""
"T: A great blend of tropical and piney hop notes and caramel malt flavors. A smooth, almost buttery mouthfeel without becoming syrupy. Finish brings a boatload of pine hop resin. Really, really good."
""
""
""
"Overall: Sometimes the bitter is a little overpowering, that's one comment I will make about the overall balance. However, this beer is filled with complexity as well as a crisp, clean finish."
""
""
"Fresh, wet juicy hop aromas and flavors that are very assaulting, even for a Stone beer. I have the feeling that this beer was refrigerated from when it was bottled all the way to in my stomach. Very, very sweet and fresh hops reminiscent of a lot of Lagunitas beers with none of the bitterness typically associated with Stone. Maybe my favorite Stone beer, along with Sublimely Self-Righteous."

"Overall I must say this is fantastic IIPA. Stone has made a statement with this brew and that is to get an IPA out to distro and into my belly as quick as possible.

"The body was good, even and clean, but was a bit thin for my preferences. Drinkability was good, if you're in the mood for a nice IPA, you won't go wrong with a couple of these. Overall, a nice example of the style, but one that's not particularly special or notable. I suspect the high ratings here are partially the result of hype over the marketing gimmick. Worth trying if you see a batch."

"O-Delicious hoppy beer. I love Stone brews and I think this is my favorite yet. It's really fresh and hoppy with a good balance between the bitter, citrus and malt."

""
""
""

"The hop bitterness is now lingering excellently. This is a fantastic west coast IPA, and being so fresh is imperative. I've felt like Stone needed to keep up with some of the amazing IPA's from the likes of Alpine or Russian River, and this beer can do that. Hopefully this will be available from time to time as I will be sure to pick it up whenever I see it. Highly recommended."

"There seems to be some variation from edition to edition (which one would expect). Just tried the Enjoy by 9/13 version, and while good, I thought it paled in comparison to the version I tried back in 1/13. So glad I just ordered a half pint of it at 16 tons."

"Lightly hazed golden amber, moderate cap of sticky white froth. Scent brings strong notes of grapefruit, tropical notes, pine needles and alcohol. Taste is obviously big on the hops - grapefruit and pine up front, ctirus, floral and grassy in the rear - malt backbone lightly crackery but covered up by the dry bitterness and alcohol notes. Fuller side of medium bodied - heavy on the palate but no too sticky or chewey. Solid all around fresh IPA, not quite in the league of the top dIPAs."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice fresh IPA. One of the better Stone beers I've had in awhile."
""
""
""
"The beer is crystal clear and appears a radiant golden hue. The head measures in at approximately a half inch, leaving sparse lacing on the pint glass. The aroma brings tangy citrus and tropical fruit. Smells awesome. The flavor is also exquisite. A hop bomb with notes of pine and a bouquet of tropical fruit. Pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and bit sticky on the palate. Highly drinkable with alcohol presence dangerously well hidden. Not only the best IPA I have had from Stone, but the best beer I have had from them overall. A world class IPA. Delicious."

"Served up in an elysian goblet - bright clear-orange body, fresh white foam. An extraordinarily clean hop profile with low residual bitterness - bright and fresh with an abundance of mango, tangerine, blood orange and lemon zest. Awesome stuff."

"O: Overall I did enjoy the beer. I was especially satisfied by the fresh hop aroma and fresh flavor. I would have liked a bit more complexity and more body to the beer, but that is always a personal preference. It was great to experience an extremely fresh beer from Stone, shipped this quickly to the East Coast. It gives a greater perspective on what changes take place in their beers during shipment and storage. I would drink it again, given the chance to. It was not my favorite DIPA, but but it was still very good."

"2.15.13 version. Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head that slowly dissipated to a thin film with a thick ring around the glass and light lacing. Aroma dominated by herbal, earthy and almost dank hops, a bit of sweet malt in the background. Taste follows aroma with very complex herbal and piney hops with a hint of citrus hops. Supported by solid sweet malt, orange and citrus rind, finishing with a moderate hop bitterness and residual herbal flavors from the fresh tasting hops. Does not overwhelm with hop bitterness, but delivers intense hop resins and esters. Medium bodied. Definitely delivers on what it promises: as fresh and intense a hop experience as possible without excessive bitterness. A hop lovers dream. I have to say the presentation of this really went over the hype boundary, even for Stone, but it does deliver. I was so intimidated by the instructions to drink quickly that I drank this the evening after it arrived in town. I do not regret that."
""
""
""
"An Enjoy By 2.15.13 poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a translucent red amber with a larger white head that dissipates to leave a nice thin foam layer and nice lacing. Smells of sweet piney hops and more hops, with a slight citrus hint. Tastes of citrus notes and nice piney notes with great hop bite. Medium bodied beer is carbonated perfectly and finishes very nice for a beer with a great hop bite that it has. Overall, a world class beer."

"o - overall, what would you expect? another solid ipa from stone. this time you don't have to worry about it being old though ;) i wish it was more like ruination 10th, that was a very special beer, but this is kinda like a lite version of that. softer and tamer and less dank. solid ipa, glad to have tried it...would definitely pick it up if i saw it on a shelf, but to trade for...might be happy with a one and done."

"Overall another solid DIPA from one of the masters of the craft. Well done, Stone."
""
"Overall: Wow, the closest beer that I have had to tasting like Pliny the Elder(gotta love the burnt plastic taste from the insane amount of drying hopping), while still maintaining it's own identity. It honestly reminds me of a more over the top Pliny with a stronger emphasis on the more tropical side of hops. The previous batch I had,"Enjoy By 2/15/13""" tasted a bit less convoluted hop wise, but Stone really, really impressed me with this one. Still no Pliny killer/contender, but this is damn close. I'm definitely going to try to snag this FRESH as much as I possibly can!"
""
""
"O : Excellent DIPA and that is terrific across the board. Definitely not just another hopped up west coast double."
"O: A great IPA. Very fresh and all the different flavors mix together really well and come through very prominently."
""
"This is my virgin voyage with the Enjoy By series, but hopefully not my last. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. Stone really knocked it out of the park with this one."
""
""
"O: overall, very drinkable and very fresh DIPA. More intense hop blast compared to Pliny. 9.4 ABV is well hidden behind fruits and oily hop notes. One of the top DIPAs for the style. Could use a slight fine tuning to make it great. Definately worthy."
""
"O: Pretty good and pretty cool. Not something I would need to seek out again, but quality stuff this fresh."
"Just released today, the freshest possible IPA. The freshness is obvious in the nose. Pine, mango, grassy notes, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, tangerine and just a hint of caramel malty backbone. The taste is the same, almost exactly. Mango, papaya, pine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, caramel, grassy, orange, cantaloupe and tangerine. Medium body, sticky, resinous mouthfeel and just the right amount of carbonation for an IPA. This is a great beer."
""
""
"Pours a bright yellow with little head (fizzy yellow bear, anyone?), BIG hoppy aromas. Dank, resinous and light citrus. All of the aromas come through as flavor. Sticky sweetly bitter. Expected bitter aftertaste, but not overly so. This could go up against any of the top DIPA's out there, and defeat many of them."
""
"Beer is medium in body, thins out on the finish leaving just hops, just bitterness, earthy strong, chewy hop presence in the midpalate, a strong beer throughout, an in your face Stone hop experience. I love it."
""
""
""
""
"Huge hop complexity, with flavorful malt profile that is just a bit too sweet."
" The taste overall was just as good as it always is with Stone, lots of flavor and hops. I would say try it out but since you can't take this review as a good reason to pick up Stone's next special release."

"Overall, the best thing about this brew was how everything was all about the hops. There was such a nice bite and grit to the opening act, with a beautifully balanced cleanliness of soap, pine, and massive citrus. Despite the variety, the depth of bitterness never really catches up with you, as the flavoring stays sweet, nectary, and insanely juicy throughout. This is one of the best Stone beers we’ve ever had."

"Is this brew all about freshness? - You bet it is!"

""

"O - I wish this was a year-round release. It's a solid, earthy DIPA.. I was lucky enough to grab 4 bottles while I was up in the Bay Area, this is the 4th and bottle (to be had right before the end of the world). It doesn't taste quite as """fresh""" as the first bottle I cracked, but it's still a fantastic beer. Yes, it's a little gimmicky, but I appreciate what Stone is trying to do with this beer. It's delicious."

"O: One of the best beers of 2012. A terrific IPA. Glad to get this from Des Moines. I'll definitely drink it when it gets to MI! A testament to the value of freshness in IPAs."
""
"I enjoyed this batch much more than the first. The initial batch seemed overly astringent and just had way too many varieties of hops lending a confusing assault on the palate. This batch is more more refined, and is akin to Ruination. A smooth DIPA with a big hop punch."
""
"very impressed."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was blown away by this beer. Arrogant Bastard finished my conversion to craft beer, Ruination led me down the path to hophead-hood, 10 Anniversary Ruination showed to me a hidden paradise, which was Enjoy By. If you at all have to opportunity to try this beer, do not hesitate. My last sip was a good 15 minutes ago and I can still taste those hops. I can leave you only with one word: Enjoy!"
"O: I am willing to become a fallen soldier, a casualty to the freshness this beer offers. This is really what matters when it comes to a great tasting IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O- i had this about 3 weeks ago and it was way better. When stone says drink it now, they mean it. This bottle is 4 weeks old, and it's already going south."
"Remarkable stuff from Stone - I haven't had too many other hoppy beers this fresh before. The price tag is a bit high, but it's definitely an unforgettable experience of sorts for hop and citrus fanatics in beer. Highly recommended!"
""
"O: I like this and I hope they keep this series going. I would buy this all the time if it was available year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The commitment to freshness inherent in this beer is quite charming. Oddly enough, perhaps the flaw here is that it's brewed by Stone... And I honestly prefer Stone's easy to get, year-round Ruination to this. On another note, I'm not sure if I believe the 9.4% ABV. This is absurdly easy to drink."
""
"Overall this is a good DIPA, too heavy on the sweet side for my preference."
""
"This beer is a sensory experience for sure. A must try, although if you dont have it already, you probably wont be trying it. I was lucky to get a share of this. Hope you get to try it too."
"Overall this is a delicious brew. Great balanced brew! The hops are intense and resinous; citrusy and bitter. Grassy and fresh but there is some nice malt backbones that allow the beer to not overwhelm. Maybe my palate is used to big IPAs but this is so smooth and drinkable the 9.5 ABV is not even a player. (4.5)"
""
""
"Second batch Enjoy By 11.09.12. Bright orange color, super head and lace. Super juicy citrus and hops in the aroma, definite west coast. More citrus, pine, bitterness, typical west coast and typical stone. This is a good DIPA and I would expect nothing less from Stone. I sure hope we get another batch of this in Colorado at some point. Winner."
""
""
""
"It's rare that I'm disappointed by Stone beers, and this one is no exception. Excellent IPA with a very complex profile - very tasty all around. In my opinion, probably the best Stone IPA I've tried. Too bad this one doesn't come to Michigan, because I'd always try to find the latest release."

"Overall: Awesome! One of the best brews I’ve had in a long, long time…the taste is very fresh, crisp, light, full and awesome…enough hops to satisfy any hop head out there…citrus and pine hops galore, the malt does add some balance, but this is for the lovers… there is so much fresh zest to this, it lives up to the “drink by” concept…definitely head of the class in this ever expanding “west coast/american” pale ale and IPA genre…if you see this, buy it…then drink it…"

"Very solid beer. Not sure it's all that much different than Ruination, but glad to see the freshness date stamped on the label and from a marketing angle, I love this beer. Taste is good if not excellent, but at only $5.49 a bomber, very good value."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer represents a lot in the fresh beer campaign, and even with that going for it, it still rocks. It reminded me of Ruination at nearly every sip, but hey – who said greatness had to be totally original? This is great beer."
""
""
"Tastes like an amped up stone ipa with a slicker body, more alcohol, more tannins, and less acidity. This beer is good but nowhere near out of the ordinary with the so called """freshness""" not playing a role to me, i've had plenty of brews that taste as fresh as this one well beyond the maturity of this brew. I think the high ratings of this beer really come from the marketing that stone did. On the distribution and retail end of things, stone doesn't do much in the way of out coded beer for the consumer so I guess this is their way of moving through beer quicker without complaints. If this enjoy by series ever gets stale i'm sure stone will never really come personally pull them off the shelves and eat the costs."
""
""
""
"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and sticky on the tongue. Stone makes some really tasty West coast style IPAs, but this one is easily the most expressive and flavorful without going completely off the rails. I'd drink this regularly if possible."
"Smells like a fresh, strong IPA with big nodes of flowers and pines. Tastes equally fresh and hoppily strong, but the flavor is tame and a near total lack of burn belays its elevated ABV. Lots of double IPAs attempt to back up intense hops with thick, syrupy malt. Other, better doubles balance out the hops with sweeter malts and interesting yeast complexities. Here, the hops don't get too out of hand, but they're still lush and variegated enough to balance themselves, making it so all the malt needs to do is provide a decent bready backend. and that's what this one does, gorgeously."
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic beer. Yea, end of the world!"
""
""
"This is easily one of the best Stone beers that I've had. Definitely better than the Ruination 10th Anniversary. Leaps and bounds beyond Lukcy 13asardt. Very tropical and balanced. This does not shred your taste buds like all that other garbage that they put out. Some booze is apparent but it's worth it. Seek this one out."
"O: I will be drinking this entire bottle and enjoying it all the way through. A complete beer. Has that very distinct Stone IPA quality about it (you'll know it when you taste it), but it's got some extra components. Get some."
"M: Medium bodied. Nice bitter mouth coat."
""
"3.4.12 - Tried the Enjoy by 4.01.13 tonight, which is a newer version. Body is heavier, more citrus in the smell and taste, taste is bigger. I think this one is better!"
""
"O- if you're a hop head and generally like Stone beers this is for you, a very solid DIPA with a really awesome concept, end of the world with an extremely short shelf life, I'll probably try to grab one more bottle if I get the opportunity"
"O-A wonder DIPA, great balance with nice bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great concept, great beer. Love it."
"O: Very well done. Bi IIPA all the way, No complaints from this guy and would love to have seen this on shelves in the PNW!"
""
"Note: Batch #3 – Enjoy by 12.21.12"
""
""
"A fantastic DIPA, this is worthy of the Mayan Apocalypse, I liked this one a lot. Through the roof drinkability"
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice hop profile with good bitterness throughout. Good overall balance."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked it. Maybe I'm spoiled by my proximity to Pliny, but this was just a likable (not loveable) beer to me. Nice take in the DIPA family, but probably the last time I'll purchase it. Plus I'll be dead in a couple weeks anyway. Onto my cellared Double Bastard."

""
""

"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation that is medium to high. This results in a mouthfeel that is prickly at first, eventually fading to a pleasantly tingling feeling across the palate that melds well with the attendant bitterness and ethanol burn. Aftertaste is expectedly dry, from the substantial hopping and ethanol presence. There is also some substantial stickiness around the corners of the lips."
""
""
""

"This is a clear copper brew, shiny beneath a dense white head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is not what I expected, but it may be because this was served colder than normal. To say the hop aroma is strong would be an understatement. The biggest aroma is pine, but there's some grapefruit, floral, and lemon notes in there too. If there's a malt aroma, it's buried deep beneath all the hops, as it should be in my opinion. After a swirl, I get a solid biscuit aroma. The taste starts off coppery with white bread crust. The hop flavor is dominant as well: very vinous, earthy, and somewhat grassy. Bitterness comes smoothly, but it's unmistakably oppressive. There is some spiciness in the bitterness too, perhaps from Amarillo. Beer finishes coppery, earthy, and vinous. The taste delivers what the aroma promises. After all that, I thought: """what about the malt?""" As in every good Triple IPA, this malt is just a stage for the hops. It's reminiscent of white bread and unseasoned oatmeal. The feel is balanced and finish dry. Although it's not malty, this is surprisingly balanced. This is a damn fine brew. Dare I say in line with Pliny!"
""
"Overall: a really well balanced DIPA that pushed the limits before breaking it. Easy to quaff despite the high alcohol content. Super fresh on draft and improved as it warmed. Great beer I hope they brew again."
""
""
""
"This is just a very well crafted, all-around solid IIPA. Great look, clean nose, balanced flavor profile and an excellent feel. I'm glad I got the chance to try this one."
"Enjoy by IPA looks pretty clean inside the bottle, no sediment. Once outside the liquid is an olympic gold medal color with much clarity. Surprisingly with a stealth pour I only mustered about a quarter inch of frothy foam up top that dissipated and left no cling, a rather lifeless looking beer. Enjoy by has a healthy musk to it. I get swarmed with citrus scents and some bitter pine backing. A nice malty backbone as well, the alcohol does not seep through. Smells more on the tropic fruit side with some bubblegum coming up with room temp. Taste is what you would expect with a IIPA, rich tropic fruit flavor, mango, orange, grapefruit, a smidgin of pine, a nice crystal malt presence. This tastes more like juice as it comes up to room temp. Not as bitter as most stone IPA'S go. Body is a healthy medium with a pleasant bitterness, but more of a juicy finish, No heat from the 9 plus percent. Carbonation is surprisingly low from the get go, so perhaps I had an off bottle. This was drinkable, but something that i have had a hundred times over in different forms."
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter, enjoy by 12.21.12 version. This pours a clear golden orange color with a small short lived white head. The smells are mostly pine and some alcohol, lighter than expected. The feel is medium, with a mouth coating resin. The taste is pretty good, plenty of hop bitterness, some floral hops, some caramel, good tasting stuff."
""
"Pretty awesome though that I'm able to enjoy this beer just inside of two weeks old when I've never even been able to try a local bottled beer that fresh!"
"O: It was better when it was colder, but as it warmed the onion-like qualities became more pronounced. The alcohol was really hidden though and I would have guessed it was 7% or so."

"O- This beer is genius! It shows off the potential of fresh beers. A unique flavor, especially unique to bottles. Get some!"
"Pours a crystal clear medium amber color with a decent sized white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Citrus and pine fill the air as soon as I pop the cap on this one. Upon closer inspection my nostrils are delighted by hints of bread and caramel that have been devastated by an onslaught of hoppy goodness. Pepper and green onions mixed with grapefruit pine and resin round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit sweeter than I imagined based on the smell. Solid shot of caramel sweetness up front followed by a hint of alcohol and a smattering of pine citrus and onion. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice IPA, but I found the body a bit thicker than I normally expect and a hint more sweetness than I prefer."
"Have had several of these in 22oz bottles then served in tulips. First and foremost it was most similar to Pliny the Elder. I sensed a lot of Cascade and Simcoe hops, with most of the aroma coming obviously from the Cascade. The beer is way hoppy and has a touch of sweet midway through, and finishes crisp. A great drink overall."
"There’s enough of a malt profile to hold up to the hoppy assault with a light toasted biscuit note that emerges as it warms. Holds up as a sipper but its also an easy drinker and hides the ABV well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer stands on it's own, but it's certainly as close to a RR style IPA that I've tasted from Stone. Great stuff."
"Color is a rich amber, with crystal clarity. Lacing leaves intricate rings and trails that cling and hold. Smell is powerful dank resiny pine. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp. Taste is really something. Big citrus, with a slight sweet-but-not-DIPA-syrup finish. Dangerously drinkable at 9.4%. A new favorite. I hope they continue to release it."
"The grain bill leaves a pretty clean slate upon which the hops can and do shine bright. To me it would be better if they had used some other hop varieties that don't impart the onion and cat piss. Still a pretty damned good dipa."
""
"Good beer. Though I'd have soon had one half its strength that I could get in a six back and down in abundance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This IPA showcases all of the character of hops like few can. What starts as pungent aromas bridge seamlessly into subtle fruit taste, then to spicy earthy notes, and then as sharp resinous bitterness late. The beer is simply a show unto itself and is a must try for anyone who dares to call themselves HopHeads."
""
""
"O- The big hop flavors have a nice complexity and good depth. I'm not a fan of cat pee hops but it subsides as other flavors/aromas outshine it. Very good at hiding the alcohol as this is very smooth to drink."
""
""
"Recently had the 9.13.13: Also fantastic double IPA with a wonderful grassy taste and caramel hops."
"O- I'm loving this brew! There's so much going on here and as it warms, i'm offered more and more aromas and flavors. Fresh out of the fridge, i'm adorned by floral, dank, earthy, spicy, hops. The taste is much the same with an added bonus of grapefruit bitterness and a slit alcohol twang that melds nicely. As it warms, citrus, fruit, and sweet malts become more apparent. Citrus and mango show up to the party with sweet bready malts as their entourage. All this comes together with an alcohol twang that melds perfectly with the rest of the flavors and leaves a tingling feeling at the back of the throat, spiciness lingers on my lips long after it's gone. If i had to compare it to anything i would say Drake's Aroma Coma. Both show light on a new evolution of west coast IPA's. A glorious future is yet to come."

"Enjoy By 12-21-12! A welcome new addition to Houston. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a transparent golden orange color- not much head. Smell- PINEY goodness. Some citrus elements as well. This aroma is world class- I get some buttery sweetness (honey?) behind the pine aroma. Guessing Simcoe was a key dry hop used here. The citrus aroma is orange rind. Smells terrific. Taste- the fresh piney hops pop off my tongue, followed by a mildly sweet (not syrupy) honey backbone, finished by a lasting and delicious bitter piney finish. In my book, this is an absolutely delicious and world class Imperial IPA. Up there with the best on them. For the ABV, there is absolutely no hint of it being 9.4%, esp because the backbone doesn't have that bruising sweetness that you normally expect to achieve that ABV. The piney hops are delicious. Really think this is wonderful, significantly better than Ruination 10 in my book."
""
""
"Another of Stone's interesting and worthy innovations/concepts. Great marketing. This one lives up to the hoppy hype. Glad I tracked down a few bottles and got to enjoy this obviously super fresh and quite tasty treat."
""
""
""
"Overall- Enjoy By is a great IPA. The flavors all hit the palate almost perfectly. And the combo of flavors make it easy to take another sip. Oh, and this beer is almost 10 percent ABV? Get out of here, because I can't taste it."
""
"Mouthfeel is fine. Pretty light and dry, but slightly undercarbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you'd have blind folded me, I'd have thought this was the new batch of Lagunitas Sucks. Honestly, almost identical in my palate's memory. A bit pricey, but high quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very clean crisp IPA, but I wont be buying it again. Very lemon/pine strong taste. If I was a big fan of the West Coast clean crisp style I would enjoy this beer more."
""
""
""
"12-21-12 version. 22 oz. bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Pours a brilliant gold with a finger of white head. Very fragrant hop aroma. Lots of citrus, esp. pineapple. Also a fair amount of caramel malt in the aroma. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest. Lighter side of medium bodied. Not a lot of malt backbone, but this is about hops. Drying hop bitterness in finish. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Great way to highlight the importance of drinking hoppy beers when they are fresh."
""
""
""
"Starts with a mild pale malt flavor. This is completely gone once I swallow--a complete hop bomb with an expected never-ending aftertaste. If you love your beer very bitter, you'll love this one. The body is relatively weak when compared to other DIPAs. The high carbonation adds to this effect."
""
""
""
"Another great IPA by Stone. It's up there with Ruination and Ruination 10th as one of my favorite IPAs from them."
"Ahhhh....a hoppy beer that constantly reminds you when to enjoy it best. Very tasty to say the least."
""
""
"The beer pours a clear yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of orange with some resin and a bit of pineapple thrown in. The flavor is similar. The orange and pineapple notes really come through nicely, adding a nice juicy flavor. There is also some biscuit malt to keep the bitterness from being too high. The alcohol is also a bit noticeable but the beer is still easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O - I loved it. I wish it was a year round release. I haven't drank the other 2 releases but this is easily one of my top 5 beers. My family doesn't drink craft beer and usually hates what I drink but my brother took a sip of mine and enjoyed this. Definitely buy a few bottles or trade for them."
"O: Pretty good DIPA but that garlic/onion overpowers the whole beer and really unbalances it. Extremely hoppy in general though it's not super bitter, just a nice strong and pleasant wave right after the middle of the taste. Tasty and drinkable enough to warrant a 4.5 here but not in the taste category."
""
""
"O: Of the two versions I have had (9/21/12 and 12/21/12) this one is the better of the two. If you like big West Coast DIPA’s I would say find (or trade for) it. Recommended."
""
""
"O: A SUPER DIPA in my opinion. Tastes better than Pliny and I hope Stone makes this a regular offering. Grab one while they last."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is beyond the upper echelon of beers for the style, it's elite. Seek this beer out and consume it fresh, don't sit on it. Thanks Stone, when you consistently push quality product at such high distribution and amounts, then you deserve to be Arrogant Bastards!"
""
"Overall - A well made trip to the land of fresh hops from stone. I was insanely impressed with this beer, and highly recommend you get your hands on some as soon as humanly possible! And, That being said, Enjoy it before the end of the world. HA!!!"
"Overall, this is unique special beer. A nice price as well. $6.29 for a 22 is not bad these days."
"Overall quite nice. Lots of great fresh hop additions, super fresh, resinous wet hop flavors, oily, just enough malt to prop it up. delicious."
"O: I saw some comments saying that this batch was more Nelson-dominated than the first one, and I'd have to agree -- the tropical fruit punch aroma and flavor has been dialed back a bit. Just the same, it's a great DIPA. Worth seeking out, though I'm surprised it has gotten quite the hubbub it has."
""
""
"This was review was done with the 2.14.14 batch. Enjoy By was clear and a copper/orange color. It had about an inch head that was off-white and frothy. Plenty of lacing was retained along the edges of the snifter. The aroma and taste was spectacular. Both citrus fruits and a resinous quality came through perfectly. Hints of grapefruit, orange, and pine flowed throughout. Overall, I have had an Enjoy By both fresh (a few days after bottling) and on the 30-day mark. As this was my second time enjoying on the 30-day mark, I think I may prefer this one with a bit of age on it (and by age, 30 days!)"
""
"Wow! One of the best double IPAs I've had. Certainly comes across as a big beer without smashing you in the face to let you know it."
""
"Pours a lager-clear golden color with a quickly attenuating off-white head. The nose is comprised of BIG citrus and pine. Once the beer settles, hop resin breaks through. The mouthfeel is peculiar and affected more than I like by the flavor. Mouthfeel should accentuate the flavor, the flavor shouldn't molest the mouthfeel. When first pulled into the mouth, there's a pleasing fullness that quickly is overtaken by the harsh hop burn and sting of carbonation for which Stone is so famous/infamous. Strong, resiny pine flavor that is, oddly enough, balanced with the grain bill. I'm not sure how much grain it would require to balance this hop assault, but they've figured it out. Another disappointment for me. Stone is just not in my wheelhouse."
""
"Never got old, booze was hidden really well. Complex."
""
"This one pours a light bodied, very clear bright orange gold in color with a soapy, off white one finger head. The clarity is great. The nose is very fresh, pungent. It has notes of light pine, slightly oniony Nelson, maybe some Simcoe, maybe some Centennial and has a light and clean malt bill. It's just really clean. The flavors too, very clean. The pine and onion are in proper ratios, favoring the light pine significantly. There is also a nice bitter citrus character. It drinks very, very light in body and is quite sessionable for both the style and abv because of this. This is a really nice DIPA. The price was certainly right on this. I like this idea, force feeding freshness is very effective. Well done Stone, well done."
"O/D-I have had some great hoppy beers by Stone. I have also had some subpar hoppy Stone brews. This one might be the best. It is reminiscent of Heady Topper and several Hill Farmstead brews I have tried. I swear that they have some Nelson Sauvin hops in there. Regardless of the applied hop varietals; this flavor is the in the same vein as my all time favorites. Hey Stone, GOOD JOB!"
"Drink- A tasty beer, but no where near what I was thinking. It was semi balanced and flavorful, but I thought this would be a 10th and 16th killer. The garlic and scallion just didnt work for me."
""
"Raul wasn't exactly feeling his first Enjoy By, but he is feeling it now. On all levels, like Megan Fox on an elliptical, Raul is feeling this."
"Enjoy by pours a crystal clear star color with a fingers worth of head. Tons of citrus notes on the nose up front with some spicy on the back end. There is a touch of malt up front that explodes into citrus and biting bitter finish. The beer is super easy to drink. I really hope stone decides to full time with this beer rather then just certain regions because I want to drink this all the time."
"O: By far one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Damn I wish they could make this fresh year round for me to get."
""
""
"O: A very good DIPA from Stone. It parades all of the lush resinous hops qualities unabashedly."
""
"Top notch double IPA! I hop (hahaha) they don't keep jacking up the price. Still, very worth trying if you love the hops!"
"O. Interesting beer. Not a lot of aroma or flavor, but extremely smooth. The drinkability of this almost makes up for the lack of depth in the aroma, and flavor."
"O- After trying this nobody should question whether or not Stone brews a solid IPA or DIPA. This is one solid beer. Crisp and refreshing, what more could one want out of a beer? Seek this one out."
""
"O: All in all, this is a good beer, but I have had plenty better DIPA's. Definitely try if you like Stone and find the concept interesting, but I find I will not be looking to hunt this one down again anytime soon."
"Stone's IPAs can be a bit too dry, pithy and bitter for my palate, but this beer was amazingly well balanced and ridiculously drinkable. All in all, Enjoy By IPA was one of the best double IPAs I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. This beer is so dank, hoppy and fruity that it left me begging for more. I would love to see Stone transition this into a regular offering."
"O - Hats off to Stone on this one. This a like a tropical party in your mouth with all the flavors of a world class IIPA. More of a dry finish than other IPA's but it just keeps you going back for the next sip. Worth seeking out."
""
"O: Much praise goes out to Stone for this one. It's a great concept, and quite genius really: market an IPA solely on its freshness date. Making the """Enjoy By""" date glaringly obvious not only ensures that the consumer gets the freshest possible beer off the shelf, but it also goads them into drinking it within that freshness date. Everyone gets the optimal drinking experience, and brewery and consumer alike are happy. The execution of this concept was no easy task either, but Stone seems to be handling it very well. Brewing different batches for different regions of the country and staggering the release dates seems to be the only logical way to go about it. Even a larger craft brewery like Stone has its limitations when it comes to brewing capacity, distribution, etc. Everything seems to be going off without a hitch though. I have yet to hear a complaint stemming from any of the previous releases. Of course all of this goes out the window if the beer itself sucks, but suck this beer does not. In fact, to top it all off, this may be the best new DIPA I've had all year. It's incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, and it drinks like a dream. I didn't believe that it was 9.4% abv until I felt it. I'm calling in a favor and getting a ride from someone when I find this on tap."
"Rocking the 12/21/12 batch. This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mango, light pineapple, light leek, dank-ish greens, sweet caramel in the background, and a touch of grapefruit peel. Were it not for everything else coming together so well, that leek would've damaged this stuff in my [nose's] eyes. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, pine resin, sweet caramel, orange rind, and a hint of greens. The fruits that are so fleshy and bright in the smell come through overtly rindy on the tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, fairly sticky finish. Overall, a damn solid IPA, one that seems to suffer from over-freshness (if you can believe that!): I think the hops might meld slightly better with a little bit of age on this stuff. Still, it's pretty tasty."
""
"O- really tasty and fresh oh so fresh! Hides the 9.4% ABV perfectly. So glad I have another! Great if you can get it. Good luck"
"Another solid DIPA from Stone. Aggressive, but never overbearing. A nice change of profile for them as well. Worth checking out and getting back again."
""
""
"O: this is a really delicious, really fresh beer, for a dipa of this much hoppage I'm glad they kept beer on the dryer side instead of sweeting in up to much... Really nice, Grab this while you can."
""
""
""
"O - Much better than I remember the first batch being. Very hop forward, but somehow nicely balanced at the same time."
""
"Added on March 15, 2013: Found more or the 4.1.13 in both NW Ohio and at Green's in Greenville, SC. Wow! Lucky me. California: the Midwest gives up."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was amazing. Probably one of the best, more floral and pungent DIPA's I've had. Would be nice to see this one year-round."
"Definitely highly drinkable for the 9% ABV which is great but the flavors don't really grab me or make this one memorable. This isn't a beer that will knock your socks off. It's a solid strong IPA but too similar to Stone's other releases to be anything special."
""
"O: very delicious beer and solid all the way around. I could definitely sip on this beer all day. Good Job!!!"
""
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel and clean. Lemon oil, resin and a pungent character of pine and grapefruit. Very easy to drink and the 9.4% is so well hidden that it's scary. Finishes dry with more pine an resin on the tongue. Stone did not let me down. Chewy biscuity character throughout with some grass and straw. Overall, a very solid DIPA."
""
""
"A good brew, but was not worthy of the hype it received.. Seemed to fall apart, perhaps it should have been called """enjoy by 10.09.12""". That way I would have had three days to have drank it. Ha. Not sure if it's worth the $8/22oz"
""
""
""
""
"I really like the idea behind Enjoy By IPA, and the beer itself is really good, too. I don’t have many complaints. The hop flavor is a tad danky and herbal for me, but it is still good. In the line of Stone’s recent DIPA releases, this one falls in the middle. It’s a little better than 16th Anniversary, but it’s not really close to the Ruination 10th Anniversary Release. Easy recommendation nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden amber with a finger of white head. Pungent hop nose on this. Very heavy on the pine and citrus peel, light herbal notes, grass, and a decent floral quality. The flavor is a touch on the sweet side with some toffee and caramel sweetness. Good amount of tangerine, some grapefruit, and a strong pine bitterness on the finish. Alcohol isn’t present on the flavor, but certainly noticeable in terms of sobriety altering effects. Good, but wasn’t as good as Ruination 10th."
""

"Overall, if you can get it TRY IT, but if you can’t you can always vote that they send their next batch to your area! I made sure to get mine as fresh as possible (bottled 5 days ago, hit my local beer store’s shelves 10 minutes before I got there) and drank it right away, if not for the novelty alone."
""
""
"Bitter as all hell with huge hop flavors similar to the nose. Dry, light malt profile makes a perfect platform for the hops. No alcohol presence for 9.4% abv. So incredibly fresh and powerful. Solid mouthfeel and caebonation. Just a wonderful beer tat I wish was available all the time. A heavy hitter, wow!"
""
"Where did this come from? And where was I in California when this was released? I was exteremly impressed with Stone on this creation. Time to set the clock when the next version will be released..."
"2.14.14"
""
"O- I really enjoyed this brew for sure. I hope it keeps coming. Outstanding job and very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty thin, but the mouthfeel is pretty creamy. Another great beer from Stone! I really like the idea behind this beer and pick it up if you still can!"
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is an amazing DIPA. Threw me for a loop, at the smell I was expecting that spicy resin hop, mid taste it evolves into this amazing bubblegum sweetness. I applaud Stone for this delicious brew and idea on drinking super fresh beer."
"My overall impression is that Enjoy By is pretty much a gimmick. Purposefully making a product that deteriorates rapidly and pushing distribution to get it across the country? Sounds like Stone has quit being arrogant and gone to being obnoxious. Nevertheless, sometimes gimmicks can turn out alright, which is the case here. At the very least, Stone should be commended for making a DIPA that isn't a complete sugary booze bomb."
""
"O-I am glad to have tried this but I guess I was expecting something a little better. The flavor was just nothing unique. If you are going to give a beer so much hype and it's own website it needs to deliver something unique. This reminded me of a slightly more piney weyerbacher double simcoe."
"Slainte!"
""
""
"Overall - Nice idea, great to know im drinking a very fresh beer. Loads of hops, nice balance of sweetness and bitter. From first drink along with the whole drink fresh as possible marketing that this beer has, makes me feel like this is a pliny clone. Its simular in flavor being so piney, though different still. Tasty and glad i scored a bottle, would like to try next batch to see if its the same beer or not. If you can locate this buy for sure."
"There's a lot going on with multiple different hops coming through. Certainly a simcoe tinge. Overall a nicely done IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a light golden with a yellow hue, slight white head and lots of effervescence. A pretty nice aroma; huge sweet and juicy citric hops on top of a slight malt underbelly. Slighlty dank. Similarly wonderful flavor. Huge citric hops that are so juicy and sweet, a touch of some hoppy resin, all on top of a thin malt underbelly. A nice crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I'd have to put this as the best Stone ipa offering I have yet to try."

"dont know how or why this beer has haters? it is amazing. the pour is an unassuming clear apple juice color with an average white head that leaves some thick lacing. the smell is incredible fresh hops. a little floral, but mostly citrus flavors here. grapefruit and sappy dankness. the flavor is just as potent. its nvery fresh beer, alive almost, light in the mouth, but uniquely hopped. theres some lighter malt that turns a bit sweet as it warms, and the alcohol comes out then too, but when ice cold from the fridge this is a special article. its it a wet hop beer? it sure seems like one. if this was an everyday beer on the shelf i would buy it regularly. one of the freshest and most complicatedly delicious ipas around right now. certainly stones best work to date in my opinion."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely the best fresh hop IPA I have tasted to date and its a double IPA taboot. More on the piney, herbal and grassy side than the typical tropical and grapefruity IPAs, a very good beer for the style with a delicious and unique flavor profile. Would have again!"
"O-I wouldn't call this my favorite IIPA because I would have preferred a little more balance in the flavor profile, but if you want a big, bold, brash (i.e., Stone-type) beer, look no further."

"EB 12-26-14: Bottle sampled 12-31-14 - Excellent IPA! Upped Look (from 3.5 to 4.25) and Feel (from 3.5 to 4.0)  and Overall (from 4.0 to 4.25) from original review."

"This is a really good DIPA. The notes are big and it is a big beer."
""
"O - I was really looking forward to this and it is a huge letdown. I still have half a glass and the other half of the bomber to drink and I dont really even want it. Maybe they use Summit hops and Im getting the """oniony""" thing that many people swear by? I dunno if that is the case because I really like Gubna, which supposedly is an """Onion bomb""". Or maybe Stone made a mistake and should have called it """Enjoy by 9/20/12 """...."
"To wrap-up this already long-winded review, Stone is of course one of the world's foremost brewers of IPAs across the board in any style, and this beer fulfills the promise of the freshest, most enjoyable DIPA you could hope for and then some. A truly phenomenal, world-class beer."

"All 4.25's."

"Wow....this is a great beer....9+%....WHAT!!! Hard to tell with such great flavor. The beer poured a hazy cream orange with thick foamy head that has settled into about a finger width thick. The lace is nice an sticky! The smell is fresh pine and subtle citrus hop. Some coriander but mostly pine and citrus. The taste has a very nice balance of bitterness and hops along with a touch of sweet malt. The mouthfeel is full body with smooth carbonation. Overall this a a very good beer."
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent hop bomb to drink for a long time."
""
""

"Hats off to Stone for a great beer and also for fighting the fight of freshness. Awesome marketing campaign. Other brewers , take note, your beer may be equal to or better than Stone, but I will reach for Stone every time because of the enjoy by date and the commitment for IPA lovers to get fresh beer."

"this is a fantastic ipa by stone. this, along with ruination 10 are their 2 top ipa's in my opinion. fascinating that they werre released pretty much back to back... puts the 16th ipa to shame."

"Pours a light, clear golden amber with a finger of white head that fades to a thin collar and dots of lace. Aroma smells like Stone beer with Nelson and floral hops, citrus and earthy bitterness, lingering herbal notes. Flavor is more bitter than expected, strong malty body, sugar and chewy with resiny citrus bitterness in the finish. Medium thick and chewy, well carbonated. A solid Stone IPA, so..."
""
""
""
"M - Light to medium body. full of sticky hop oils. Light carbonation."
""
""
"O: Excellent DIPA, but less hoppy and more caramelly than ideal. Maybe the hops are already on the downhill."
""
"04.01.13 on 3/5/13, which is four days after it came into local stores. Pours a nice bright medium honey tone. Looks pretty clear, maybe a touch of haze. Medium white head. Fine bubbles. Some lacing. Aroma is full of bright hoppiness. It's a mix of floral, sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Some things that come to mind: sweet grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple, papaya, kiwi, lavender. Very nice. Little to no malt contribution. Maybe just a bit of simple sweetness. The taste is chock full of hop flavor, and the bitterness is tuned just right for my palate. There's no bland bitterness to this beer. It's always complex and delicate hop flavor. Absolutely wonderful taste. Mouthfeel is light. Gentle carbonation. Long-lasting hop finish. No booziness. This is an excellent DIPA. I tried the first version and was less impressed, but perhaps, I didn't have a big enough pour or something. This beer is tasty. If you like hops, I can't recommend it highly enough. Kudos to Stone."
""
""
"I loved every minute of this beer and quite possibly Stone's best beer."
"O: A very nice beer. Full on West Coast style IIPA."
""
""
"Overall I really like this idea of offering freshly hopped beers with a drink by date and I really enjoyed this beer but the inflated price tag (due to the cost of bottling/shipping so fast, huge late hop bill and small hype due to limited distribution) make this a bit under-whelming. While no means a bad beer, it's actually a great beer, it's by no means the be all and end all of DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mild carbonation, very smooth feel in the mouth, medium body with lingering tingle of bitterness. The hops flavor is not as intensely fruity as it is on the nose; rather more spice and green flavors emerge with the bitterness. The beer has marvelous balance and perfect harmony of flavors. A nice peak of malty sweetness crests just as the hop bitterness begins to settle in, and they both exit smoothly and slowly, allowing each sip to be fully enjoyed for a full, happy moment."
""
""
""
"Considering this is 9.4% abv, the light to medium body and clean carbonation is really surprising. Alcohol is completely hidden, with your taste buds getting all of the nice hop flavors. Really happy to have a had a chance to grab a bottle of this to get sent up here to Northern California and hoping the next batch will officially get sent here."

"Overall: One great DIPA! The entire experience was enjoyable because no one aspect dominated and it is bitter and hoppy while being sweet and tropical at the same time. Simply one of the best, IMO."
"Suggested. It's a hope lover's unique experience of what can also be done with hops..."
""
""

"O- Good dipa. Lots of floral and herbal notes makes this beer different from most dipa's. Really enjoyed """Enjoyed By", pun intended."
""
""
"O - As a lover of IPA's, this is a phenominal beer that once again shows Stone is more than capable of brewing great IPA's. The entire concept of this project is a great idea and I hope they continue brewing this particular beer or other big IPA's with the same idea. great job, Stone!"
""

"O: A great IPA, very much West-Coast style. Love the concept of the enjoy-by thing."
"O: Overall a great aromatic appeal and equally well flavor shows a soothing complexity of tropcial, citrusy, and grassy nature that blends oh so well together. Kudos for Stone for getting this straight out from the bright tank to our watering palates here on the east coast. The abv of 9.0% is complimentary and never inteferes with the flavor or aroma like most bigger beers do. The aromatic hops and flavor is well refined and focused, which certainly earns high regards here."
""
""
"A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Stone never disappoints me. We have been selling out at work and have been very limited on this beer. I am very lucky and consider myself fortunate to try this fine crafted ale. GET YOUR HANDS ON IT IMMEDIATELY if you can. Price shouldn't be an issue here, just try it, you will not be disappointed."
"After rating this, I think I had to have either received a different beer or a tainted one. Will give it another go."
""
""
""
""
"D - Wow! After a disappointing 16th Anniversary beer, Stone really stepped up their game here. Great hop profile and extremely drinkable for the ABV. I hope they make this again in the future."
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This is probably the best beer that I have ever had from Stone and glad that I live in one of the three states getting this beer. Hope I get to have another one of these before the enjoy by date. Little bit of a palate wrecker"
"A very nice, obviously fresh IPA."
""
"Still, I gotta hand it to Stone for the concept here. The majors all tout bottle dating and such, but its high time attention is brought to skunky craft brews that have sat on store shelves too long..."
""
""
"O - I wish this beer was more widely distributed, but if you see it in your store... tackle it. Especially at $6.99 a bomber..."
"Being an ipa nut, I found this exceptional and can't wait for next iteration."
"Another terrific Stone IPA, and the freshness angle comes shining through. Grab a few of these if it comes to your area."
"Stone's Enjoy By IPA pours a translucent tangerine, with some goldenrod highlights. Two plus fingers of frothy white foam cap the beer and show some decent staying power. Lacing reveals the head to be fairly sticky, but it doesn't absolutely coat the glass like the best do. The nose is absolutely fantastic. Waves of mango, pineapple, and gooseberry come through, with just a little bit of grapefruit thrown in for good measure. If the aroma was just a bit more pungent, it would be perfect. Each sip greets my palate with just a little bit of malt, some light caramel and bready notes. The hops are a little more unbalanced here, with lots of mango and white wine grape here, and just a little bit of the more citrusy flavors. The Nelson Sauvin hops actually get just a little overbearing at times. Still though, the flavor here is one instance where I wish scoring was in quarter point increments so I could give this beer its full due. The mouthfeel is superb, highlighted by an unbelievably light and lean body. I've had 6-7%ABV IPAs with heavier/chewier bodies than the one I find here. The carbonation, while lively, could stand to pop a little more. I love the idea behind Stone's Enjoy By IIPA, and this super fresh hop bomb lives up to its promise and then some. I'm just glad NJ was one of the markets to receive it."
"For $6.99, I thought this was a great deal but maybe that was in light of my [unfortunate] trend towards buying more expensive bottles of beer lately. Bottom line, was easily one of the best beers I've ever tried and possibly my favorite."
""
""
"O - This is a fantastic DIPA. It just hits all the high notes for me. It might just be how fresh it is but this is going down as one of the best DIPAs i have ever drank."
""

""

"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some peach and apricot aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, earthy and herbal hops, and a malt finish. There is a medium hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and some solid herbal hop flavors."
"O: Really great DIPA. The aroma is fantastic (reminds me a bit of Lagunitas Sucks) and I like the concept behind the beer as well."
""
"Growler from the brewey for $15...Nelson on steroids! If you appreciate both Alpines Nelson and Stones Ruination then you will love this crazy beer. Never thought Stone would brew this but they continue to amaze me. Tastes like a small batch brew, but from a big ol' brewey. Keepin' it real....Amazing beer, buy it if you can get it before 9/21/12!"
"Flavor tends back towards the citric hops in the mix. Quite light in the malt substance yet the ABV is deceptive nonetheless. Good taste but not earth shattering by any means. Decent feel with a moderate linger of the light malts and a good spritzy carb. level. Overal a bit mixed. Good but not worth the media nor the price."
"Overall - The complexity of hops here is beyond description - huge citrus flavors, but not sweet at all - also alot of floral and herbal hop flavors here too. DON'T let my mention of lavender, onion, chive and basil throw you - you have to taste this to believe it - it's like a perfect symphony of super fresh pungent bright green hop nuances, especially citrus, floral and herbal - and there is a slight sweetness here, but its seems completely natural, the level you might get from a slightly under-ripe yellow grapefruit. This is what hopslam would taste like without the honey. Your mouth will be alive after each sip, I'm going to purchase alot more of this!"
""
"Chewy full body that's much heavier than anticipated.   Slightly hurts the drinkability.  Dry bitterness up front with dank, sticky hops that linger over sweeter notes and pale malt into a slightly dry finish.  Spicy hops, grass and earthy pine are slightly floral but countered by sweet fruit notes.  Not as tropical as nose suggests with some grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel.  Pale malt backbone is a bit stronger than I prefer with strong biscuit and graham cracker graininess toward the finish.  Also, there's a strong perfumy booziness that gives off some distracting sweetness toward finish.m ABV is decently masked for 9.4 but it's still a bit strong for me taking away from the hops.  Overall, this beer has some nice hop flavors but needs more tropical/citrus fruit sweetness, a  lighter body and less booze.  Decent but nothing out of the ordinary."

"Pours a deep gold with amber hues topped with a two finger bright white head. Significant splotchy lacing as the head recedes. Notes of tropical fruit on the nose, especially pineapple and mango and flora. Pineapple is the dominant flavor throughout with accents of papaya with a fairly sweet hefty malt presence. Finishes sweet with grapefruit rind bitterness. Heavy malt backbone, medium carbonation and silky, smooth on the palate. A solid DIPA from Stone, but certainly not heads or tails above others, and tends to be more of the same and is a bit overly sweet. Personally, I prefer a finish that is a bit drier, and the finish on this brew is about as sweet and fruity as one can find, with the usual grapefruit rind bitterness. Frankly this brew is a bit unbalanced, and those that prefer sweeter characteristics in their DIPA's will certainly be all over this one."
"O: Very tasty, easy to drink despite being the ABV. I'm interested to see what Stone does next with what I can only assume will become a regular thing."
""
""
"O: Quite an enjoyable DIPA; it didn't blow me away, though I was taken aback on the first sip. I haven't seen any bottles around here yet, hopefully they'll show up, so I have something to compare with the on-tap version."
""
""
""
"Overall, great beer, well worth the hunt. I'll be sad to see it disappear."
"O Wow, I will getting more of Enjoy by Date if there is any left.Awesome!"
"Overall: Best Stone beer ever? Probably. This is a great use of nelson."
""
""
"I like what Stone is doing with this branding... definitely educates the consumers and retailers about the necessity of freshness. Anyway... poured into glass, crystal clear brilliant gold appearance with soapy white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is pungent and fresh with tropical hoppy goodness along with some pine, sap, orange, apricot, and grass. Taste starts with moderate tropical fruits and caramel sweetness, followed by piny bitterness along with and herbal and syrupy component. No booziness here, nice balance. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy with medium carbonation. Overall, one of the better IPAs I have had from Stone. Super fresh and super delicious."
"(4.5) Overall, this experience seemed to be better than the last Enjoy By IPA, but if they're the same recipe, then who knows. My palate isn't perfect."

"O: Cool idea from Stone getting the beer out to markets so quick.. was very excited to try it and glad i did... would i go out of my way to get it again.. probably not.. enjoyed their 10th anniversary ruination a bunch more, still another quality release from Stone"
""

"Get it while it's fresh! Thanks Stone!"

"O: What a cool concept by Stone and great execution. This is my favorite Stone offering I have had to date by a landslide. As others have noted this beer reminds me a lot of Nelson. Which is perfectly fine by me as that is a stellar beer. Get this while you can if you can."

"Light golden color and you can easily see right through this well filtered beer. Hop aroma is present a good distance from the nose. Hops are strong on the spices - almost fresh cracked pepper and basil - with a small amount of citrus. Some malty sweetness on the backend but certainly not the star. Thank you Stone for enforcing freshness of this hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is nice. It's not only good but it also breaks away from the typical Stone house character, which I appreciate. Enjoyable and difficult to fault."
""

"Overall, I thought this would be more of a hop bomb like they advertised, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. Amazing beer by an amazing brewery. The novelty of the whole thing adds a great sexiness to the whole experience. I'm glad I could get more than one bottle of this, and look forward to sharing this with others. Good job, Stone. Keep this stuff coming!"
"Stone continues it's roll. This innovative release program rewards those who keep it fresh,and move it quick. After all the videos and how too's I finally get my hands on a fresh specimen today. Having enjoyed, very much I may add, the Ruination Anniversary as a youngster, and thought the 16th was OK I really had no idea what I was about to fall into. This pours a pale copper, the cap is dense, white and recedes rather quickly. My first inclination that I'm into something special is when I bring my tulip to my nose. Seriously, the most intensly aromatic nose I have ever enjoyed from Stone. Very Alpine Nelson meets KRBC Citra nose, totally intoxifying. It just gets better as the flavors fall in line with the nose delivering sweet mango, tangerine, lemon, orange and white pepper notes. There is a beautiful bitter blast from the enormous hop bill, just enough malt to keep it all in balance, remember this is totally a west coast variation, so were talking hops, dry and fruity. The mouth is dry, clean and utterly refreshing, there is absolutely no detection of the 9+ abv lurking underneath the entire package. Gains complexity as it warms and never is hot. This would be Stones biggest seller by a land slide if made available year round. If you can find a fresh bottle now do what you have to, it's that good."
""
""
""
""
"O - This doesn't disappoint. I wish Stone could've gotten Ruination 10 to me in less than over 2 months, because I can't really compare. This is definitely less malty IMO, with a great hop variety. They're the 2 best beers I've had from Stone. I don't think this can disappoint any hop head. I've had better IPAs, but this is definitely up there."
