"I did not like this beer. Sadly ended up drain pouring it. It was not what I excepted it to be at all."
""
""
"Best IPA ever! I waited one year for tasting this and it didn't disappoint!!"
"Bottled 2/17/14. Deep amber and sediment laden with off white pour. Licorice and alcohol fumes with caramel - spicy fruit as it warms. First sip tastes like cotton candy dissolved in rubbing alcohol. Hot alcohol exhale. Spicy apricot with caramel middle. Hoppy candy finish. Intense heavy alcohol laden mouthfeel. Big flavors, rich sherry like linger - very few beers compete at this level."

"I realize that this is going to be a """boozy""" beer, and my rdev is going to be off the charts here. Even World Wide Stout couldnt mask all of the alcohol. However, I am just not liking the flavors and I don't think they are well integrated. They are all over the place. This just seems like a mess. It reminds me a lot of Double Crooked Tree (which I didn't care for either) for reference, or a Molotove Cocktail on the more positive side. It is definitely along the American Barleywine lines more so than an Imperial IPA. I would be open to trying one with some age on it. It cant really be worse for me."

"I have a second bottle that's going in the cellar for a year or two.  There aren't many rough edges on this brew, and it's an IPA (and therefore best if it's fresh?), but the bottle does say that it ages well so I gotta see."
""
""
"So complex its defies logic. 11 month old bottle. Certainly hoppier fresh because now its almost a barley wine. Which is an awesome thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a sipping beer."
"Very malt forward with some sweet caramel and just a lingering of the hops bitterness.  Chewy, biscuit mouthfeel, but easy to drink."
""
""
"Alcohol fiendishly well hidden (in a good way). Molotav Cocktail without the extreme pine flavor and bitterness. A dangerously drinkable beer for the high abv. Bottle aged in my cellar 1.5 years."
"Deceiving mouthfeel; a smooth IPA with a big dry bite."

"Big double really malty  and hopped out"
"on draft at the Yard House"
""
""
"2oz pour at EBF. 2011 vintage"
"Thick consistency, pours nice. The hop smell is amazing. Alcohol is upper teens/low twenties. It's fresh, crisp, clean hop with a kick. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
"People expecting an IPA are sorely disappointed with this beer. """120 Minute Barleywine""" would be more descriptive. At over 19% ABV, this """beer""" packs a punch. Although this was my first time trying it and because I knew what to expect, I was actually pleasantly surprised by it. It's boozy, it's sweet and it aromatic. A solid sipper for sure."
"another great beer by a great brewery."

"2013 vintage, aged at 68 degrees in zero light. Bottle 3 of 2013 batch enjoyed 3/22/15. After two years this batch is finally starting to mellow out. The first bottle was tasted in 2013 and comparable to nitromethane race fuel. The second bottle, aged one year, was tolerable but still very Boozy. Today I enjoyed the third bottle of 2013 dfh 120 and found it much more pleasant, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very hoppy, foamy white head, still slightly boozy in taste, but at this point no more so than your average imperial ipa. 100% improved from one year ago. Will update next year with bottle number 4 of 2013, and later this year for bottle 2 of 2014."
"This beer punches you in the face.  It may be for others but not for me with an over abundance of hops which is the idea with this one"
""
""
""
"5oz draft pour into a snifter.  I was surprised by the initial foamy white head, but it quickly diminished, as did the lacing as I went. Very drinkable for 18%, but a bit of a mediciny booziness.  Worth a try, but at $1 an ounce, not the best bang for the buck in the double/triple ipa category."
""
""
"This beer is ridiculous. The definition of cloying."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Tried this on tap at Whole Foods. Wow, very well balanced, amazing aroma. Very strong brew, one glass will do. Eveything about this is amazing. Not always available, must get it when it is."
""
""
""
""
"I loved this beer, but for some people it may be too boozy. Considering its 18%abv you have to expect an alcohol kick. I personally enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"this beer is beyond beer it's just awesome"
"High- quality beer but too high octane. Once over 12%... it looses its definition as beer for me. This IPA feels more like a barely wine than an IPA... I think DFH should have quit at the 90- minute... which I would rate much higher. Not worth the premium price for all the other options for solid imperials out there. One-time-buy for me."
"I like this beer however it has a very strong alcohol taste and aftertaste"
""
"This review is for a beer that was aged 4 years.  It was excellent for a sipper.  I shared with friends and the non-beer drinkers also enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
"5's all around on this one. Incredibly high ABV without tasting like booze. Crisp clean and refreshing. Be careful with this one because it is very drinkable with 18% alchohol"
""
""
""
""
"I personally think this beer is best at under a year old. I understand how well it can age with ~18% alcohol, but with it being an IPA, and me being a bit of a hophead from time to time, I think the Hops cut the alcohol beautifully right out of the gates. I have had one fresh and one just over three years old, and I personally like it better fresh."
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer on draft at their brewery."
""
"AWESOME beer!!!!!  Nothing more needs to be said."
""
""
""
""
"Its was more or less Hop Liquor at this fucking point. I drank 9 ounces on an empty stomach and o boy...Great beer. Great experience. A bit of a let down? I expected 5 out of 5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle during a bottle share.  I only got about 3 ozs and poured into a pilsner glass.  Poured a burnt orange, amber color with a thin head that quickly disappeared.  Aromas of booze, booze and more booze with some malt and hops lying beneath.  Little scared what it might taste like.  Turned out to be pleasantly surprised.  Yes lots of booze with a little burn on the finish but a nice mix of malts, hops with fruit.  Caramelized sugars are in there as well.  Sweet taste that lingers on the aftertaste along with hops and booze.  Leaves a tangy taste in the mouth.  More West Coast IPA than East Coast pine tree.  Still sucks the spit out of your mouth like all IPAs.  But less than most.  However, I am guessing a full glass would dry you out due to the alcoholic content.  Probably the perfect beer for outdoor hockey season on a cold day or night.  However, I sure as heck wouldn't be driving and drinking more than 1 of these beers."
""
"Amazing must try this for sure"
""
""
"This definitely needs some age to it. I am going to review this one again after a year down in the cellar."
""
""
""
"Overall an amazing beer and well worth the $13 I paid for a 12oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good. I wad expecting huge things, so I think that's why I wad let down a bit. But still good!"
""
"Pours a light brown with thin white head which quickly dissapears. Definetly get a strong scent of alcohol.  Tastes of fruit, hops, slight orange tint. The alcohol is fairly present and noticeable on the back end. The strongest beer I have had to date. Is enjoyable but do prefer 90 minute out of the 3 main offerings in the series."
"I wish this beer was a person so I could be good friends with it."
"Overall- An easy decision every year to grab. Enjoying this while snowed in and its a perfect late winter beer on a night where you don't need to operate a vehicle or heavy machinery. 90 Minute is still a better IPA in my opinion, but this is a nice and decadent and rich flavored beer to treat yourself with when you can."
""
""
"Got it had it love it. Nnow to age it. I'll try my best"
""
""
""
"I can't do a fair review until I get the opportunity to have another one, but it was the best beer I've ever had. The distribution range is pretty limited, unfortunately. The 60-minute is also incredible if you can't spring for the alcohol content. But you can. I mean, come on."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely deserving of a high rating. One of my favorites from a brand that has a fair amount of stars."
""
""
""
""
"Very good for the ABV. 90 minute is better in my view"
"This is the best IPA I've ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Came across a couple bottles and snatched them up.  I cracked one open and decided to age the others.  Definitely in your face with the heat but I really enjoyed it.  Can't drink these that often but a nice treat once in a while."
""
""
""
"Wow DFH.WTF go."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer lives up to its reputation. The taste was surprisingly more mild then I expected a high content beer like this to be. If you can find it grab it immediately."
"Simply liquid art! A wonderfully balanced beer. Had on tap locally, thinking about moving in!!!"
""
""
""
""

"Smelt and tasted real boozy. Very good batch."

"Just as an afterthought I did not think the alcohol was too apparent but my GF said """It is good but I feel like the alcohol just punched me in the face.""" haha"
""
"Malty, boozy and hoppy. Kinda sticky/sweet. It had been a while since I've had this but much better than I was expecting."
"I can't add anything that hasn't already been said. Just a little bit boozy at the end. Just a little."
"Bought 2 , i guess late 2015/eRly 2015. Totally Lived up to the hype. I bought 2 with the idea of aging. Not going to happen. Cant wait for the next special occasion to break it open. Next friday will do."
""
""
"So tasty. Had this after a few drinks. The abv is higher than the taste."
"Very boozy finish.  Out of balance."
""
""
""
"Looks good smells good. Going to catch a lot of flak for this but tastes like straight alcohol. Might have tasted slight citrus before it burned my palate."
""
"Picked up one with a bottled date of June 2014, so nearly a year old.  It looked and smelled like orange soda.  It tasted almost like a sweet alcohol, almost brandy-like, with absolutely no burn.  I was at first just a little bit disappointed as I thought it would be overwhelmingly bitter, but that comes on the finish.  Not sure if it being aged changed  it a bit.  But wow, like nothing I've had before.  $13 bottle was pricey, but I'll be trying again soon."
""
""
"Overall this is a great beer fresh or aged. I am reviewing the newest batch from 2014. I would strongly suggest sharing this with at least one other person, its a lot for one person."

"It's nice when you realize that your palate may have been untrained the first time you experienced a certain beer. I recall submitting a post about the only beer I ever drain poured. DFH, forgive me. My best guess is that I didn't check a bottled on date when I danced with this devil more than 7 years ago. Despite claims that it ages well, I am digging the hoppy experience I'm getting from a super fresh bottle. One whiff and a bed of hop cones made their way up the nasal cavity. That intensified with the first sip, featuring multiple layers of citrus notes on steroids, tethered with a honey-like sweetness that conditioned the effervescence of the warming alcohol. Fresh baked bread, so doughy and sweet -- this brilliant mothereffer is one exceptional treat. Hats off to Sam and his entire crew. I am sorry that I revisited this world-class beverage with reservations. My palate just did a flawless rendition of Beethoven's unreleased symphony. This beer is larrrrrrrrge!!!"
""
""
""
""
"suggest you don't drink more then 1 and go with a session-able beer after this"
""
""
""
"A little too boozy for me."
""
"As others have stated, I do not understand how this is called an IPA.  It's more of a barleywine."
""
""
"Acknowledging this was a 9-month old bottle, so perhaps the more identifiable hop notes had disappeared by now, but otherwise I'm hard pressed to conceive how this can be called an IPA. Incredibly sweet, overwhelmingly so, the sweetness cut simply by the warming booze. Perhaps as it warmed some acidic hop notes emerge, but they're quiet at best and do nothing to stem the tide of sickeningly sweet malt and booze. I applaud the novelty of it all and the effort to experiment/expand our notion of beer...but this just falls incredibly flat."
""
"Too boozy for me brah"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best beer that I've ever had. Given the high alcohol content it's best to let this age 3+ years. If you find it, buy it."
"Nectar of the Gods. The reason I gave it a 4.75 overall is because I have to drive to the East Coast to get it. I live un KC. Worth every penny though."
""
"This is an awesome ipa"
""
"O: As I find myself getting boozed up off of one beer, I can't help but be amazed at what I'm drinking.  It's an experience like no other, and just because it's a 120 min IPA, don't expect it to be a hop bomb.  It's very complex, and is something everyone needs to be willing to throw the money at and try."

"2010 cellared bottle in a snifter.  Very barleywineish. Need to pick up a fresh bottle to compare."
"Overall:  if not for the major burn, this is a perfect sweet big beer.  A personal favorite of mine regardless, love to have one of these every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had one fresh bottled and one aged for a year. The dried fruit flavor of the fresh bottle was very prevalent. Much more rounded caramel flavor in the aged bottle. No difference in color between the two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this after a year of cellaring, and MAN was it delicious."
"V - Very expensive, almost 10 dollars for a single bottle."
""
""
""
"Brilliant. Caramel corn nose and initial taste. With a year or two on it this is a beautifully chewy barleywine-esque beer. Huge butter and toffee nose with a smooth and bitter finish. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled on 09/17/14. I drink few IPAs so I am by no means an expert, but this is an EXCELLENT beer. I really enjoy this one. Hoppiness is not overbearing, but it let's you know it is there. Quite a bit of heat on this one though. Fruity aromas, lemon, orange. These can be detected in the taste as well. I would buy this all the time if it wasn't so expensive, but I'll enjoy this one and the other one I have left."

"Too much alcohol to get a good taste, start with the 60 then move up."
""
""
""
"Very delicious and worth the wait."
"Tastes to me like a Hoppy Quad with a bite."
""
"8oz pour into a snifter.  It's a boozy IPA in the vein of Founders' Devil Dancer.  A ton of smooth alcohol with heat and hops, but not the slap-you-in-the-face hops a lot of IPA's strive for (and I distaste).  Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"A unique sipper that caught me off guard and left me feeling toasty.  Dig."
"For me, gets better with age.  Taste is sweet and smooth with a pleasant booze finish."
""
""
"Best IPA I've ever had"
"Kind of felt like this bordered on barleywine. Thoroughly enjoyed it"
""
""
"love this beer. probably my favorite IPA"

"Simply an awesome beer. Definitely a sipper, but incredible taste!"
"If you ever find yourself staring across from this beer... no matter the price point, it is something you must try as a beer nerd. Nuff Said."

""
"Interesting beer but not my cup of tea"
""
""
""
"Having never had this before and my first bottle being a '08 vintage, I'm truly impressed with how this held up. I would love to try this beast fresh but age works magic on this monster of a beer."
"I'll try another in 1 year to see how this develops. At 18% this could easily age for another decade. I've consumed a 4 year old DFH ale (not 120) that had no signs of oxidation or reduced carbonation so I trust this brewery."

"Poured 12 oz into a std pint glass.  Clear pale gold with nice head.  Great lacing.  Aroma is a bit understated.  Huge full malty mouthfeel.  Not real sure how to rate an 18% beer but this is awesome.  Sip it like a fine (yet malty) wine."
""
""
""
""
""
"World Class, must drink. Save a few bottles for the next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorites, but not something I could drink a ton of or regularly. For me, it's a good one to have a handful of times/year. 4.25-4.5 (though if you can get it on draft, you might be inclined to give this a full 5 stars, as I recently did on Untappd)."

"I had this draft at new local pub and enjoyed this beer... even at 18% it wasn't overpowering, pretty smooth for something this strong.  Very drinkable probably not as flavorful as a fresh Pliny or Sculpin, but really did like)"

""
""
""
"O - This is not an everyday beer, or even every month. This is a special beer for special occasions. Treat it as such. I enjoyed this over a 2 hour period and appreciated the changes as it warms. This is a great beer, but is difficult to find and expensive when you do.  For me, personally, that takes away from the beer. Definitely worth a try if you're curious. You won't find too many beers like it."
""
"Love this beer.  Especially when aged for years.  Just did a side by side tasting of an 08 vs 14.  Completely different beers. The 08 was a beautiful dark amber.  Time had done incredible things to it."
""
"The best. I'd drink it warm."

"So sweet! Truly surprised by this one. Had on tap at the brewery and boy was I surprised. As the yeast gorge themselves on the massive amount of sugar, they are unable to process it all and are thus left with not only a high alcohol content but also a powerful sweetness. But even this sweetness cannot outpace the bouquet of hops present in this extravagantly hopped beer. With an extremely high price tag, this is not one for the light of heart. If you love extreme IPAs then you will love this beer."

"O - Disappointing :( I wanted to like this beer, I really did - I looked for it for over a year, and was ecstatic when I finally found it, but it doesn't come anywhere close to living up to the hype... My wallet sheds a tear for my poor gut. Half a bottle down, 3 1/2 to go..."
""
""
""
"Overall very good. Actually tasted better than described to me by a friend. For some reason drinking this reminds me of the Simpsons when Bart and Milhouse drank that super-squishee (Milhouse takes the first sip and his glasses fly off)."

"O--I gotta be honest I was pretty disappointed here.  The booziness was a bit too strong and the malts overpowered the hops.  I don't know if they boiled away all the hops but they shouldn't have"

""
""
"My favourite beer, hands down"
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is heavy and hot.  It looks common and smells sweet.  It has a heavy, sweet, and hoppy taste.  The mouthfeel is almost syrupy.  Overall I gave it a 4.25 because it has a big bang with the 18% ABV.  Otherwise, I would have marked it down for being overly everything.  In the end, it was worth the try, but at $3.50 for 4 oz I wouldn't search it out.  It was nice to finally try."

"Bottled 9/17/14. Pours a well carbonated deep golden glass with very little head lingering as time passes. Nose is big time boozy. Some hop profile in the nose but it definitely takes a back seat to the boozy, malty caramel notes. Taste is enjoyable. No burn but some bite. Sweet malt character shines through. Some brief hop notes in the finish. More hops in the aftertaste than anything. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. Overall I really enjoyed this. Loved the fresh aspect of it. And while boozy, it was not at all overwhelming. Enjoyable in small quantities."

"Overall: This is one great DIPA and was well worth the wait, I can’t wait to taste this one again, definitely one of the best beers I’ve had in a while."
""

"Definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. I think a majority of it has to do with the fact that I enjoy the sweetness that hits you first from the malts on this one. Definitely a chance of pace from other IPAs"

"This pours a hazy copper color with a slight head. The aroma is good and bold with hops but nothing over the top like you might imagine with this beer. The taste is big and bold with decent amount of sweetness from the alcohol content and no where near as hoppy as I would have thought. Really flavorful and well made."

"O-really impressed with the age impression on this brew. I'd age a little less for more of the hop character to shine through. The age has certainly transformed this beer into a beer that transcends the normal expectations for a DIPA. Somewhere between a 4.0 and 4.25 overall. Cheers."
"This beer is ambitious and that is all it is. I like Dogfish Head as a brewery, and I am really glad they are in Bloomington and Indiana on the whole, but this beer frankly is just awful with no redeeming characteristics. I ended up drain pouring it. I have had enough beers like Founders Devil Dancer that I can appreciate an ambitious attempt at making a one-of-a-kind beer, however, this beer is just too much. There is fine line between a pleasant beer, which rather than attacking the palate attempts to work with it, and a beer that fights your palate every step of the way. I wouldn't recommend this beer to my worst enemy."

"I'm really not sure how to rate this within the parameters of the style. It's such a big beer the body and high alcohol drown out the hops somewhat. I'd give it a higher score if I could taste more hops than alcohol but it's just so boozy. It's a good beer and very interesting, not a great IIPA."

I enjoyed and shared this beer while watching a beautiful summer sunset. The beer's bright golden/orange color blended beautifully with the changing sky. As I said, I shared this beer and even half of it got me quite buzzed. This is because the alcohol content is so strong; if you are looking for a beautiful high this is the beer for you. The hops aroma and taste is intense yet it achieves for me a perfect balance with delicious syrupy and caramel like malt sweetness. One of the few beers I can give a 5 to. Quite possibly perfect. We're it not so expensive ($10+ per bottle) my fridge would be stacked with these beauties!"

"This was pitched to me as the holy grail of American IPAs. And, you know, it was good but the 18% ABV is a little unnecessary and influences the taste. The beernerd orgasms over the 120 minute didn't connect with me. Maybe it was just too much hype."

"O: A remarkable beer, and fantastic experience. I have two more aging for future enjoyment."

"It's possible that the bottle I tried wasn't very fresh and that resulted in less hop flavor and more booze - but from what I've heard 120 is pretty boozy regardless. I'm glad I got to knock it off my list, but I won't be seeking out 120 again."
"2011 Vintage. Poured into snifter, a honey gold amber with a razor thin off white head. Aroma upon pouring is sweet floral bouquet, honey and caramel malt notes, some brown sugar. Taste same as aroma, has a nice fruity, citrus orange alcohol flavor with a mild hops bite, which has undoubtedly been mellowed by the aging. Plate is a full creamy and smooth body, with good carbonation. The finish is a combination of all the aforementioned taste and flavor, although they intensify as it warms up, the ending is sweet with some light annotations of some vanilla and earthiness and actual bitterness intensifies a bit as well. alcohol seems to be well hidden. Almost barley wine style. Overall a very good, full flavored after dinner drink."

"Had this on tap for the first time after many years of drinking bottles. I love this beer no matter how it's served, but I do recommend aging it for about 3 years before drinking. When it's fresh it's all hops and booze. When it's aged all sorts of different flavors emerge, the boozyness goes away and it changes color from blonde to more of an amber.  It kind of tastes like bourbon when aged with a nice vanilla/raisin lingering finish. Be careful when drinking, this one will knock you flat on your ass."

"Haven’t really cared for Dogfish Head beer. Still felt the need to try this. Hazy copper color. Very little head. Malty alcohol aroma with a mild hop smell. Tastes pretty good actually. Not really an IPA flavor though. Much more like a barley wine. Lots of alcohol burn. Feels more like drinking liquor than beer. I’m glad I have someone to share with."

"You need to drink this beer knowing hat it's probably close to twice as high of an ABV as your typical imperial.  Knowing that, you go into it knowing that there will be an alcohol presence in every sip.  I drank this one over the course of about an hour or more and by the end as it warmed it mellowed quite a bit.  I enjoyed this one for sure."

"Overall: I thought maybe I'd need two to really appreciate, but man right out of thebottle was love at first drink. So smooth, rich and creamy. Props to Dogfish Head. They really produce a good beer. This 120 falls right in line, and probably to the top, with their other beers. I am a fan. They have a way of filling every gap that their water allows. Excellent flavor and I am happy to have made the trade (just one!) for a heady. Highly recommend for anyone, not just IPA fanatics like me."

"D:  Such a weird beer to produce and then call an IPA.  Even coined as a Barley wine this wouldn’t be a favorite.  Very low drinkability to this one.  Glad to have finally tried the 120 but not something I could touch often.  I am not sure if the aging has made any significant impact without comparison."

"It's already been said in several reviews. This is this best beer I have ever had. It's a big beer though, so sip and enjoy. Someone said they had three. I would love to, but one is my limit then I drop down to the 90 min. Pour in a nice glass, marvel at the color and aroma. Take a sip and relish. You're probably drinking the best beer you'll ever have."
"I was so excited when I finally got to try this brew, and my anticipation was matched only by my disappointment. I'm sorry, 120 is just...kinda...gross..."

"I was hoping for more from this beer, mainly hoping the alcohol were a little more hidden, and also that the sweetness would be cut a little more at some point in the taste.  There are some very interesting flavors in there, and I get different things at different times.  Have one of these to age as well, wonder if a """mellowed""" version of this will give me more if what I am seeking."

"This beer can be described with three B's: Big, Bold, and Boozie. The aroma is slammed with toffee, caramel, and vanillia. While the taste has those I also get some slight apricot bitterness with burnt orange peel hiding in there too. The alcohol content is very noticeable in this one, but that adds a lot to its character. Grab some and cellar for those cold rainy days."
""
""
""
""
"While not a fan of IPA's in general I am a real big fan of the 60 and 90 minute so I bit the bullet, put out the money and decided to give this one a try. Outstanding appearance but not as sweet a nose as the 60 and 90. Wow, now that is strong beer, you definitely notice the alcohol in the flavor but does not taste as strong as it is, but you do get the warmth as the beer goes down. As I drank the beer if continued to grow on me, I adjusted to the alcohol and then it became tastier and tastier as it warmed. A great beer and I have to say is worth the price."
""
"The aroma of thesis beer hits you as soon as you open the bottle.  Poured into a chilled glass it built a thick head.  Deep ambur in color. Slight cloud.  Very clean sip.  Start out mild but builds very quickly.  Strong caramel sweetness with a citrus note.  The scents and flavors compliment really well. Definitely use a food ipa glass.  The alcohol content is a bit high for my taste but the overall deliciousness of the beer overtakes any negative. If you're a hops fan this is a must try!!"

"Bottled in 2012. Poured with a deep garnet color with a slight chill haze. Started with a short off-white foam that reduced to a wispy cap. Caramel malt, toffee, and dark fruit aromas with citrussy ripe orange and lemon zest followed by an undeniable booziness. Medium bodied with a thick oily feel through the middle and hot, boozy finish. Caramel malt and toffee flavors up front with ripe citrus flavors in tow that are overwhelmed by heavy, boozy heat from the middle to the end. Finished with a very boozy sweet toffee aftertaste. The bottle says it ages well. Maybe 2 years was too long? This was a very boozy English Barleywine to me. I'd be interested to see what a fresh, unaged bottle tastes like in comparison to this. But, I'd rather put my $10 toward a 4-pack of Burton Baton."

"O: This was a well crafted IPA. You can tell how much time and effort went into this ale. The $11.99 price was completely justifiable. Sam and his Dogfish crew know what they're doing down there in Delaware, and this beer was further proof. It's a must try. Beware, though. At 18% it has a tremendous punch. I have a high tolerance, but this took me to the limit."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: After years of searching for the legendary 120 Minute IPA, I've finally gotten to try it. Since this is a beer that I never had incredibly high expectations for I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I will say it is much more akin to the barleywine style. Not outstanding but very good. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"Having had this on tap and out of a bottle and into a snifter, I just cannot dig it. I tried, really hard, but this beer to me is hype. Cool, 18% give or take, but I want flavors and there is just an overwhelming alcohol taste/nose burn from this that I cannot ignore. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy I tried it and also glad I have a bottle to cellar, but overall, the experience of sharing a glass on tap and sharing a glass out of the bottle was just unpleasant. I love dogfish head, but this one, is not something I would seek out. There are plenty of great high-teen ABV beers and great high ABV IPAs that I would enjoy splitting with someone, but this tasting (actually these two) was more unenjoyable than all of them.  Bottom line to me, is that there is a great deal of hype behind this beer. Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I don't have the palate. But both my girlfriend and I, who do almost nightly tastings of new/different brews could not dig this either of the  times we've had it. I would only recommend this if you want to say that you've tried it. But, check back in a few years after I've aged one ;) not that I expect my opinion to change much."

"Huge thanks to Dogfish Head for making one for the hardcore IPA fans. I think I can easily say that 120 Minute IPA has earned its way into one of my top 5 favorite beers of all time. If I’ve ever had anything close to a perfect beer, this is it. I’ve finally peaked. I guess that should make me sad because I don’t know if I’ll ever find anything more delicious, but it makes me happy, because I feel lucky to have been able to find, enjoy, and savor this exquisite brew over easily one of the best hours of my life. It is simply out of this world. It is everything that is craft beer. Bravo, Dogfish Head. Bravo."

"Where do I start, this beer completely took me by surprise. Its bold but you can tell that just by reading the outside label. Pouring it and taking in it's aromas, my taste buds started salivating immediately. It has a very potent citrus and pine scent with a very enveloping tone of vanilla and herbs giving it a sturdy weight. The actual taste itself lives up to it's aroma completely. It is very rich with a powerful hop flavor! I picked up on some of the finer notes of vanilla, spice, raisin, and a slight mineral flavor all wrapped up in tangy notes of orange and pine. I love this beer. It is truly complex and makes you think about what your drinking. In my opinion, enjoy this one like a fine scotch or bourbon. Just a few sips and I got a head buzz from all those hops! warm it up a little in your glass and your golden. I plan on buying a couple more bottles and letting them age."

"Pours a deep clouded amber with just a thin ring of head around the top. The aroma is interesting. The aclohol esters are strong and sweet, balancing against a floral note. The big 18% ABV comes up loud in the taste, as well, dominating initially and fading out quickly. The remainder of the flavor is hard to describe. The bad is full and thick and smooth. This is one to sip and enjoy, if for no other reason than it retails $10 or more a bottle."

"Here's the simple straight dope in terms of all i care about ...taste. This was basically the 90 minute turned into a boiler maker. That is my opinion in terms of both taste and alcohol content. You could taste the alcohol and it was not ggood.and my I'm ediate reaction was that it tastes like a boiler maker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Unique, and no doubt extreme. Very well built, the malts and sugars keep the hops from exploding in a bitter supernova, meaning you get a chance to actually taste the layers of malt and hop and appreciate the elements. I cannot say, with all the IIPAs in the world, that this is the one I'll reach for first, but I can respect the craft and effort without necessarily thinking this is my go-to brew."

"This beer has intense layers of flavors from sweet to citrus to malty bitterness. After a few sips the bitterness of the hops gives way to the more complex flavors. At 15% ABV it packs a punch: It hangs pretty heavy in the mouth and has more alcohol burn that I expected. It is something even an experienced beer drinker may want to work up to. And this is not to be taken lightly."

"A very angry beer. Pours dark amber with a very thin head. The smell had a lot of booze in it but also bits of hop and citrus escaped. The taste was very sweet from the booze but after the initial reaction you get a lot of subtle and amazing notes through the beer. A lot of toasted malt and even some lemon. Something everyone should try once, maybe even a couple more."

"O: I know that I scored the taste and mouthfeel really high, but I feel as though this beer is just a tad bit TOO much, and therefore the overall score suffers a little bit as a result. Let not that be an insult to the brewers: the folks down at Dogfish Head are absolute artists when it comes to beer and have crafted an absolute behemoth of a beverage here. The complexity in the flavor is off-the-charts, and the mouthfeel is absolutely a work of art for a beer of its stature. However, with that being said, DFH 120 Minute, in all of its over-the-top glory, strikes me as a strictly once in a blue moon treat. Something this intense needs to truly be savored and simply can not be enjoyed regularly. I will be purchasing another bottle to age for a few years, and may not find myself drinking it again until said bottle is sufficiently aged."

"Was not expecting this. It's really hard to put this in the class with other Imperial IPA's that I enjoy so much. At first smell, I knew that this was something very different. A boozy, almost bourbon smell - nice, but wow! The appearance was a very clear copper with good carbonation. Taste was nice at first, (by the end of the bottle, I had enough) with a real malty sweetness and a really subdued hop character - hard to believe that the IBU's on this are at 120. Very nice tasting - sweet, with a warmth like a distilled whiskey. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. I did, it took me around an hour to sip through 12 ounces. I'm glad I tried it. I don't need to try it again - especially at $13 per 12 oz. bottle."

"O:  Amazing beer, very drinkable despite the alcohol content, lives up to the hype, well worth the $12.50 I paid, exceeded my expectations"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Perhaps this would be better after sitting a while. Not my cup-o-tea. Reminds me very little of a typical IPA. Everything about this beer is too extreme, really just a novelty - but I already understood that prior to purchasing. Would likely be a drain-pour if I hadn't paid almost $10 for it. Overall - poor drinkability and a poor value."
"Pours nice, a little lacing. Clear amber with some cream colored head. Lots of hops on the nose along with some alcohol. Taste is the same, big alcohol burn on the finish. Thick and oily mouthfeel, a bit much with the high abv. A novelty beer but fun to collect. Have a couple from a few years back. Will have to re-review when I have one that has sat for a bit."
"Late note: and I see where this beer is usually sporting a 15-20% ABV (per Dogfish's web site - my bottle does not list the %). and the label states it ages well (no kidding, with this hop profile and ABV!). and this probably explains my slightly off-kilter frame of mind while typing, reviewing this beer, and grooving to a Blue Note Hank Mobley CD that just came in the mail from Europe...well, the point is, this is a powerhouse beer, done up nicely, and worth exploring in a myriad of ways..."

"O: As others have said, I have a hard time classifying this as an IPA. So the recipe and process are IPA, but the result is a barley wine (in my opinion). That said, this is a sipping beer, it simply cannot be quaffed. It is well balanced, and very restrained considering the claimed 18% ABV. It's young and raw, but I saved a few in the cellar...hopefully time will improve an incredibly great beer."

Very glad I tried this aged, and looking forward to a fresh one. Be careful, this is likely a one-and-done, do not drive after a glass of this BA's :)"

"O - An extraordinary beer from our friends at Dogfish. It really is remarkable just how much care and passion goes into this little bottle. Honestly, I would rate this in the top ten beers that I've ever had the pleasure of tasting and a world-class beer that truly stands on it's own. I'm still not sure if I'd call this an IPA or even a triple IPA. It's more of a cross between a double IPA and an american barley wine. I'm glad that I finally had the chance to try this fresh. I've been cellaring a couple of bottles for over a year. Looks like it's time for a vertical tasting!"

"I actually thought it had more in common with a heavily hopped barleywine than an IPA. It had a pretty sweet malty taste and a decent amount of hop flavor and aroma. I may seek out another bottle to age but with the hefty price tag, I would go out of my way to find it."
""
""
""
"Overall- great beer but cost to much money for 12oz. If I find it again ill age it and see what I think different."

"This beer does have an excellent taste, but man is it powerful for a beer. The alcohol content in this beer seems to over power the hops that are supposed to be present. This is the self proclaimed """holy grail for hopheads""" and I won't disagree with that necessarily, but I will say that the hops do get lost a bit in the high alcohol content. That being said, This is an excellent beer and I will definitely and gladly drink it again. Dogfish Head continues to do excellent stuff!"

"Sweeter nose than anticipated..almost throws me off for an IPA to smell this sweet. Start to smell the hops as you breathe in deeper. Booze smell is very prominent. Golden amber hue is ideal..slightly foamy head and surprisingly creamy - not thin at all. Taste is very boozy and hops are almost overpowered by the booze. Overall I'd say this beer packs quite the powerful punch and is not reminiscent to 60 or 90 min WHATSOVER imo..although you have to appreciate what it takes to make a beer like this one. Definitely a sipper."
"Pleasantly surprised here. Not exactly what expected, actually better! Absolute must try. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O: This is NOT an IPA, not at all. It's a barleywine, and a damn good one. Like a lot of DFH offerings, I expected little enjoyment. However, this is genuinely my favorite offering from them. Hey DFH, more beers like this and less beers with moon dust!"

"I heard the hype about this beer and had to give it a try. It's so good, sweet, malty, hoppy all at the right amounts IMO. This is a great beer and is one I will age and try years from now.. If you find it, get it. I would say Three Floyds Dreadnaught is the closest to this, but without the FFF signature crispness and taste. Love both beers, this is a must have I think."

"O: Overall, I am enjoying this beer very much. I purchased one bottle a few months ago to celebrate with after passing my comprehensive exams for my master's degree, and I am very glad I chose this beer. I've always loved DFH IPA's, and had always wanted to try the 120. This beer is extremely well balanced considering how much alcohol is in this beer. Any hop head (and non-hop head alike) would be pleased with a bottle (or two, but I wouldn't recommend in one night) of these."
"It got easier to drink or maybe we were just getting drunk on this one """beer.""" I am going with the latter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a big IPA guy, but Dogfish head makes my favorite IPA's, and they're my go to brewery for IPA's. This is easily my favorite IPA overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First time I have had a chance to get my hands on one and the expectations were high. This beer did not disappoint. It was very fresh and smooth. The alcohol was there but did not distract from the flavor. Everything about this beer worked for me, a joy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Dogfish brought me into the game of IPA's and after drinking them so heavily for the last 6 years I've wondered if there would be one that I could retire on saying that it's the """cream of the crop""". And while I haven't lost faith in the brand nor the beer, this years 120 minute was sup par for me."
"It pours a completely opaque muddy orange color with a thin white head. The nose has pine forest, mango, lemon candy, caramel, molasses, and a touch of char. There's a HUGE hop characteristic to the taste with grapefruit, apricot, orange juice, and orange peel notes. Pitted against that is a cloying sweet malt backbone with molasses and burnt sugar. A lot is going on here and it's overpowering on the palate. The body is full, rich, and boozy: it tastes like someone took a bag of those orange slice jelly candies, liquefied them, and added rum. I also get the taste of plums and raisins, so it has some flavors that are not typically found in double IPAs or other hoppy beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was lucky enough to have a bottle of 2012K given to me by a fellow BA. This was served chilled in wine glasses between 5 of us. Poured a much lighter color then I was expecting for being 18%. The nose was a little boozy, but I could smell the IPA behind it. The taste is not what I was expecting at all. It was DELICIOUS! The booze didn't come out in this one and the hops were still incredibly tasty. This was a white whale for me, having always wanted to try it. It was a real joy to try and this was the favorite of everyone out of the 5 rare's that we tried."
"It certainly, certainly did not hurt that the alcohol was quite recessed here; so much so that I don't think I've ever had a beer where what I felt and what the actual ABV% was were completely different from each other. I could have downed a few of these in a sitting but there's no way I'd still be sitting up straight at that point. This was brewed on 2/17 of this year and boy,did it still taste fresh. If it were possible to brew mead and toss in some floral and earthy hops and then add some Belgian sweetness in for good measure, this would be the end result. Nothing on the shelf is quite like this and this is one of those beers that has to be sensed to be believed. A really wonderful surprise here!"

"O- This beer should be a bucket list item for everyone. Not to be drank regularly, but enjoyed to celebrate an occasion or after a hard day's work. This thick mother F-er even sticks to your lips and you can taste the hops again after your sip! Just try it."

"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, like a hop bisque with honey and molasses in it, mild carbonation and a slick feel that trails off very sweet and hoppy. This beer is much better fresh and I’m glad I had a few fresh bottles this spring since the aged bottle I had in March did not impress me. This 3 month old bottle was great so my view is to drink this beer fresh. This review raised the overall scores across the board here on BA, as this is how I recall this beer being when I first had it years ago. Buy it fresh and drink it. Cheers!"

""
""
"This is borderline not even a beer...not sure what it is really. BUT, it is awesome. It's cloudy as hell and strong as hell. Almost no carbonation and extremely boozy. It really seems like more of a novelty to drink it as this point, which is probably due to it's limited release."
""

"This beer has a lot of hype about it, and it sure does live up to it ! As the thick aroma hits your nose, you know you are in for a treat. It is bold, has a lot of character and you can certainly taste the alcohol. However, unlike most beers, the strong alcohol flavor takes nothing away from the taste. If anything, it adds to it. This is a beer that you want to sip on and if possible, condition if for a while as it ages very well. Overall, this is one of the best beers around. My only complaint is the appearance is very plain. However, we all know that it doesn't make a bit of difference to the taste which is why this beer gets a perfect overall score in my book."
"O-Bottled on 7-8-2008, so it was aged and do not know if it had changed. I am looking forward to trying a fresher one"

"our 2nd highest average score of the 12 brews tasted at 4.69. At 18% this was a very smooth beer."
"O: OK I admit that i did not have the balls to try this fresh mainly because solventy alcohol booze is not my thing -- I will drink hard alcohol if that was what I was looking for. I might try this again at one year old and see -- this one is 2.5 years old and already is firmly in the American barleywine camp. A pretty big letdown but I might give it another try if I can find a younger bottle."

"One of my favorite beers. Hides the alcohol bite pretty well. Very sweet with a strong vanilla note. Currently aging a few bottles to do a side by side. Not as """hoppy as most IPA's surprisingly. The 90 is also very good, and a lot easier to find. This is more of a rare find/special occasion beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a novelty DIPA. It's good for what it tries to be. It's not supposed to be balanced or conventional in any way. Therefore, it's really, really hard to grade this one. This is a must try for any beer person...it's a right of passage into beer geek-dom."
""
""
""
""
"O - A sipper for sure, but an amazing one at that. Well done. Think of it like buying a nice bottle of wine. It costs the same and is definitely a sipper"

"O: it's a bit of a workout ... the massive sweetness, the super-thick syrupy mouthfeel, the slight alcohol burn -- I could see even an avid DIPA fan not going for this. at the same time, this brew is coming off like pretty much every other DIPA I've tried in that huge caramel/mango/vanilla sweetness both in the nose and taste, and while I can feel and detect the at-least 15% ABV, it's actually hiding it pretty well."

""
""
""

""
""

"O- overall it was okay, I enjoyed it a lot when it was fresh. But the hops really died out. Its almost not even an IPA anymore in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I can see how one who isn't a fan of ultra-hopped beers would prefer this brew aged to tone down the alcohol and bitter hoppy nature. However, 2 years on this has essentially turned this into an over-the-top barleywine. I'll take the fresh version every day of the week, this was a drain pour."

"As a hophead, this is my perfect pallet wrecking brew. The hops punch you in the face the moment this huge beer passes your lips. Be careful because the 18+ ABV will kick you in the face faster than a pissed off mule. Grab a few if you can drink half and store the rest. This year beer much better than your ex."

"Overall, there are so many different sensations to focus on while drinking 120 minute, that this beer stays interesting through every sip, and for every bad flavor it seems like there are two delicious ones, so it's not fair to knock this beer for some of its harshness."
""
""
"Bottle from 11-26-08. Poured a deep orange with some whitish head. Very little lacing. Aroma was mostly boozey nail polish. Taste was about the same; really boozey, some citrus, some vanilla, some medium malt sweetness. Ended up drain pouring this. Sad, because this beer is great fresh, and great with 2-3 years on it. I'll be cracking the rest of my old bottles soon to see how they're holding up."

"Overall: I would drink it again and again. Alcohol is king though. I would rather age for a while. Definitely drinks smooth for being 18% alcohol. Almost too smooth.. Would like to try this aged in oak barrels."

""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot more now than I did a few years ago. I don't think the beer is all that different, just my tastes. It doesn't taste like an IPA, more like a barelywine. The hops are there in the aroma but more subdued in the flavor. Definitely a world class brew."

"I've rated a ton, but I'm compelled to comment here. 120 may pass as decent for a barley wine, but as a DIPA it is terrible. Alcohol overpowers it and the hops are nowhere to be found. Maybe it's my fault for expecting a HT or PtE because of hype, but it's nowhere near the level of any of the great DIPAs."

"O- Can I say disappointed? WIth 60,75, and 90 being so very impressive I expected this to crush them all. I instead encountered a totally different beast. More Liqueur than beer, this beverage needs to come with a warning. A warning that it should only be consumed in small quantities after a hearty meal. Very much digestif-like. Give me Averna or Fernet any day..."

"O-I have had sips of this beer before and not been overwhelmed, but I thoroughly enjoyed my bottle this evening. Obviously, at anywhere from 15%-20% this is a huge beer, so if subtlety is your thing, look elsewhere. But if you've got some time to sip and big, balanced, digestif-like flavors are on your list, this is a fine example of how to do big beers right."

"Sweet orange and mango up front a little syrupy giving way to herbal, pine, earthy hop bitter punch. Mouthfeel is a little confused syrupy, chewy malt, thin a little thin and whispy reaching for a dryness that is only attained in an aftertaste. This is an extreme and interesting beer. It is excellent, and I am thoroughly enjoying it; still, I have nothing to gage it buy. It is in a class of its own."
""
"I know I'm a minority on this one - and I think Dogfish Head is usually brilliant, but this was just a trainwreck. Incredibly boozy and hard to drink and has no direction. I'm convinced that a load of hops and malts were tossed in and this was the end result. If I want a Dogfish Head brew, I'll stick to Burton Baton or 90 minute. Both of which are infinitely better and less expensive."

"Holy hoppy barleywines, Batman! Yeah, this used to be an Imperial India Pale Ale bordering on an American Barleywine, but the age has turned it into just the opposite. Nonetheless, still a great beer. If I want to get my hop and barleywine fix, I now know where to turn if I don't have any fresh SN Bigfoot on hand. Additionally, this beer is not for the faint of heart (read: lightweights). 12oz, roughly 18%. Tread wisely. Sharing recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I told myself I wasnt gonna like this one and I was absolutely wrong. Will pick up another bottle and maybe try aging it for a year or two if I'm feeling frisky. The beer is really well balenced between hops and malt, with the 15%+ alc. not playing a huge factor in enjoyment, at least in a negative respect. Would recommend for the avg. hophead to at least give it a shot, who knows?.... You might be pleasantly surprised."

"I know it isn't considered productive to just bash a beer, but this is not only bad, but also one of the worst beers I have ever had. It's an overly malty, syrupy, boozy mess of a beer. That said, I will stash one in the basement for some time to see how it mellows out. The 90 and 60 are both better (and cheaper)."
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Not as good as the 90 Minute. Perhaps a bit too sweet and boozy but still a classic from Dogfish Head"
"I expected a wildly spicy hopbomb, but this is a syrupy fortified, chewy wine--a dessert wine that I don't deserve! What happened to the 120 this year? It's truly awful."

"A very interesting beer. It's powerfully sweet, and powerfully alcoholic, but there's so much variety in the flavor that I barely (for 15% plus) notice the alcohol. Despite this bottle being relatively fresh at 3 months, I find this more like a barleywine than an IPA. If an IPA, it's certainly a malt-heavy one."

"a deep amber pour, no sign of carbonation but very clean pour for the amount of sediment in the bottle. smells of alcohol up front, lots of honey and sweet malt. the flavor is a malt bomb. much of the boozyness is faded, lots of sweet caramel, honey, and tons of barley. full body with very low amount of carbonation (shocked there's any at all after 10 years). i have to say, this held up VERY well. this was the first year i drank 120 minute, and it's nice to have gotten a vintage from that year 10 years later."

"Overall I consider this a very special beer, only to be consumed during special occasions. The taste kind reminds me of white wine (Chardonnay); however, It has a much more complex taste than wine. It's surprising how smooth this beer is for its alcohol content. It goes down very smooth for the 18% ABV contained in the beer. I would definitely buy this one again. My only advice is please drink responsibly because this beer is very smooth for the amount of alcohol that it contains, making it a really good beer."
"overall: I was expecting a not very drinkable alcohol bomb, and what I got was quite different. For the high ABV, this was way more balanced and drinkable than I would have ever expected. You can actually pick out hops and the malt backbone and not just the alcohol. Dogfish Head took it to the extreme with this one, and it came out amazingly balanced. For the curious, this is an easy choice, just buy it. Worth the $10, will buy again on special occasions. You feel great after just one..."

"Overall: This is truly an incredible beer, and one I'm glad I had the pleasure of trying. It was my 100th overall beer (based on my home computer database, rather than BA) and definitely one worth the honor. Everyone should try this beer. I want to pick up a bottle or two and cellar it for a few years to see how that sweet malt develops over time."

"All in all I thought this was a good beer and a very good and extreme example of the style, once you get past the intensity there some nice layers of flavors and aromas that make it a pretty complex beer that's nice to sip on. It didn't have the best drinkability, it's going to take me quite awhile to make it through the whole bottle and I really don't see a way that I could drink another one unless I wanted to get completely wasted, one is the perfect size and it would also be nice to split with someone. What I like the most about this beer was how complex it was, it seems like every time I smelled or sipped it I picked up a new aspect that I didn't get before. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I know beers this strong are always pretty sweet but this one was bordering on syrupy sweet. I would buy this beer again, If I see it again I would like to get a couple bottle for the cellar, I have no doubt that this will age well and hopefully it will get a little smoother with age, I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong and intense beers, just because you like a couple IPA's doesn't mean your ready to take on the hop and alcohol onslaught which is 120 Minute IPA. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it wasn't as harsh as I was expected but it was still a very intense beer that isn't for the faint of heart. Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer, I know when a brewing a beer that is this strong it can get to be pretty difficult and it shows how confident Dogfish Head is to regularly make a beer that's this intense and so difficult to brew, it takes balls to do something like that and you have to be a little crazy, but it all comes together as one hell of experience that everyone should have least once. So far this is the strongest beer I have ever had, I think it's about 18%. Good job Dogfish Head, it's nice to have a brewery like you guys that makes special beers like these that are great to have on special occasions, here's to 600 more reviews."

"Overall: A unique beer for sure. While this beer has characteristics of an IPA such as the bitter hop finish and citrus notes, it also takes notes from other styles such as the thickness and mouth-feel of an imperial stout, as well as flavor notes from several other different styles. This is definitely the sweetest IPA I have ever had, but all being said this was an extremely enjoyable drink experience and I can't recommend it enough. Obviously, this beer is one to tread carefully with, as it packs a punch."

"Poured into my tasting snifter. My second time drinking it, first review. First time was on tap and slightly different, if memory serves. Pretty reddish gold color. Medium to smallish head which dissipates quickly, yet laces nicely. Wonderful citrus fruity/produce market aroma. Oranges, pine, lemongrass, melon. Big sip... Sweet, full bodied. First thing to go through my mind is the word Barleywine. Citrus, dark fruit and big brown sugar. Far from tasting like an IPA, except for the hop bitterness across the very middle. The back end is surprisingly sweet. Good lingering aftertaste. I found this to be more carbonated than what I expected from reading other reviews. Alcohol is masked well by the ABUNDANCE of flavors, but is HIGHLY evident as soon as it hits the belly. Alcohol hits you similar to a warm red wine buzz. Body is slightly thick and sticky. A good beer to sip and swirl, and it warms very well. One word description of this beer: Relaxing."
"Overall dont expect this to taste or smell or BE anything like an IPA, because its definitely not like any other. This is a barleywine and thats what you should be expecting. Im very impressed at how balanced this beer is considering the extremely high ABV. You'd think this was 10 or 11%, not 18! Bonus points for that."
""
"Holy citrus bomb. all i smell is faint hops and a case of oranges. zero booze on the nose which is mind blowing for a 18% ipa. taste is pretty hoppy but again the orange cuts through it so well. this is incredibly a session beer.. if this was toned down alcohol wise i would drink a dozen in a row. probably the holy grail of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It has a slight flavor of a barleywine, but with the big malt and thick malt flavors. It's an extreme beer that you should try. It's a good sipper and worth the try."

""
""
""
""

"D- So incredibly smooth for the amount of alcohol. This bottle was less than a year old and most of the hops seem to have mellowed out. My previous bottle was ~5 years. I'd like to try a freshly bottled one in the near future. As far as sessionable, nope, after one I had a very nice buzz on."
""
""
""
""
""
"For an IPA, surprisingly not very hoppy, at least compared to the 60 and 90 minute brews. And for a beer with quite a punch at 18% ABV, does not taste too strong, until you feel the effects after the last drop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a stellar beer that any hophead needs to try. The complex, dark, sugary nose and flavor are delicious on a cold night with friends. If it wasn't for the rarity (at least in Texas) and the price this would be a weekly drink."
""
""
""
""
"I love me some hops, but if I wanted something this sweet I could drink soda. Still better than a AAL."

"O: this was one of the first brews i had when i got onto the craft beer scene and it was too strong. but this is simply amazing to me right now. i find this well balanced for 18% and i will definitely be grabbing more of these"

"O: certainly not for everybody, including myself....in the mood for an intense, rich, hoppy cordial of a beer? this is king....and when they nail it, they really nail it, and it's wonderful and an achievement in brewing to marvel at!...something to keep tuned in to batch-to-batch...."

"Overall: Actually not half bad. I'll be interested to see where 1 year of aging on the 2nd bottle I have takes this beer. 18% ABV, and the wholly sweet nature of this brew make it a slow sipper to enjoy and warm up on a cold night."
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow. Just wow. Flavor """play""" between the hops, malt, and alcohol is incredible. Warms like a whiskey. Malt sweet is almost belgian-like in character but not belgian-dark (strong dark stone fruits). Hops play back and forth with incredible delight and doesn't completely destroy your palate with bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is fine for samples, but a whole bottle is a lot to take in. I think I should have waited longer to let the alcohol die down. To be honest, I have no idea how they call this an DIPA. It is more like a strong ale or a barleywine. This beer really needs to be aged a while or drank superfresh on tap (like I had at DFH)."
""
"O: Lots and lots of flavor, alcohol burn stays with you without being overbearing, sweet"
""
""
"O: This IS a cocktail, letting it sit in a glass whilst doing other stuff is how to drink this. It develops before you open it, in the glass, and as you enjoy it. GREAT beer, in my opinion."

"Glad to get a whole bottle to try- the only other time I had this was only a couple ounces. Plenty of depth to enjoy over an extended sitting so I'm glad I took my time on this one. Also glad to have a 2011 to try soon to compare. Overall this is far from my favorite imperial IPA but it's a uniquely enjoyable experience that every hophead should have at some point."

"2012 vintage. 12 oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a hazy gold with a finger of white head that quickly dissipated. Big piney hop aroma. Flavor started off with a nice hit of hop bitterness. Finish was very sweet. Lots of malt and full bodied. Not as boozy as I would have expected. Glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."

""
""

"If you have one now wait. If you have two, drink one and wait for the other. It is not your everyday IPA. AT ALL! It is more like a superior Barleywine with a hop presence. Any way you slice it, it's awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy and light brown in appearance. Smell for me was not at all what I expected. I thought it be very hoppy, instead smelled boozy malty and a little fruity like fig. Taste was also very different and hard to detect much hops. Tastes much like it smelled for me, primary flavors were malty, caramel, figs etc. super high alcohol content not that noticeable. But beer is very sweet and different than I expected, (not hoppy at all). Glad I tried it but tastes more like a barley wine. Hated it at first, but grew on me as I got accustomed to the different taste. Definitely a unique brew that was a little misleading for me."
""
""
""
"Although the bottle clearly mandates that this could be aged for decades, as a self-pronounced """hop head""" I am disappointed that the citrus and tropical fruit tones have almost completely disappeared in the last year. Still an iconic beer on which I'm very glad to have splurged!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Bottom Line: Very good offering from DFH with a high price tag."
"O -Freaking amazing. Unique and complex. Too extreme? If your a wuss, maybe. If not, you can totally lose yourself in the depths of this powerful boozy beast. Yes, it's intense. Yes, the flavors can be jarring, and it might not be the most balanced beer available. That said...may I have another?"

"Have had this many times both on draft and by this bottle. THis is without a doubt an extreme brew. I think of it as the port of beers. Big Alcohol and Sugary hops up front, tropical and dark fruits as it warms. Very rich mouthfeel, similar to high end BW's. Taste is toffee, maple coated hops, figs, and booze. I feel it gets even better with age. Drink this bad boy over and evening and smell and taste the wonderful change as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like sugar water and alcohol. You definitely smell more booze as it warms up. I poured half and drank it, and then poured the other half and drank it. Color is similar to other DFH brews like the ninety minute. More carbonation than I had expected. It tastes like beer with a shot of gin. It is sweet, but not too sweet. I like the novelty of an 18% abv beer but it isn't something that I would pick up every year. I will cellar one to see how it changes. I feel like 120 has a fan base like Fantome beers do, but I do not care for those much either."

"I waited for about 4 years to try this beer. Because of living arrangements, I was never in a state that carries it. I found this in Texas, and was extremely happy. The 90 minute IPA is my beer of choice. After having this, that has not changed. The biggest surprise from this beer is the sweetness. It is sweet like the Three Philosophers is sweet, with an IPA finish. Very interesting beer. Very tasty. I drank an entire 12 oz bottle to myself over a two hour period. I have three more that I am keeping for enjoyment at different times. Going to hold one for at least couple of years."

"O - A nice treat for all the senses, at any time, holding in consideration that you don't have anything important to do, like operating heavy machinery, or taking care of a small human. And for the love of all that is holy, DON'T DRINK ONE AND DRIVE!!! Just by volume, this beer (This batch) is equal to a little over 4 Bud Lights in alcohol, or 2 shots of Jagermeister. It can do things to you, most of which are nice, if you (as previously mentioned) don't have anything pressing to do. Great with a Don Collins Rum-Dipped Cigarillo (From Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico.... Look them up online, order some of their cigars and RUM, and thank me later!), or some applewood smoked Jerk chicken. I love this beer. If you don't, you haven't had it yet. CHEERS!!!"

"Dogfish Head did a good job with this but I would describe this as more of a scotch ale/barleywine/IPA hybrid as opposed to an Imperial IPA. I have to deduct points for the high cost and misrepresentation of the style. Tasty nonetheless, and one I would revisit every couple years."

"2012. Pours an almost clear amber color with a very small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very sweet and malty. Good amount of hops. Floral, citrusy...and oddly enough, there is a good amount of dark fruits. I'm picking up some raisins and figs. Sweet vanilla as well. Taste is...oh so boozy! I guess I was expecting this though. Sweet and boozy vanilla flavors with pine and citrus. Figs and raisins with some sweet apricot flavor. Hop flavor, but not very bittering. Burning, stinging floral flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this beer is very interesting. I've been longing to try this beer, and didn't go into it with very high expectations. It exceeded my expectations. Great sipper beer."

"Split a 2009 bottle with my brother on Xmas Eve. Poured into Duvel glasses. Not a lot of carbonation left, but decent lacing. Smell was sweet and hoppy. Flavor was pretty potent still for a beer a few years old. Very malt and hop forward. We both thought it was edging towards becoming a barleywine in terms of characteristics. Quite easy going down, so mouthfeel was good. Extremely tasty beer, but it's a tad hard to justify the pricetag. Trying it once on a special occasion is good enough for me."

"It's much more of a B-wine than an IPA, per style claim. I could imagine if DFH tweaked it a bit they would have much more success marketing it as a B-wine... I would be very intrigued to see where this brew goes with 10 years in the cellar..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty and fairly easy to drink after the initial bitterness bomb."
""
"O: Overall I didn't find the beer to be all that pleasant to drink. I find it more of a novelty due to its high alcohol content. I found it remarkable that the alcohol hides so well in the flavor, but despite that the flavor and aroma were lacking. I also felt that there was too much sweetness to the beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a sipping beer, and it's something to enjoy over a period of time. Definitely not something you can pound at a bar. This definitely lived up to the expectations. My first try left me a bit disappointed and then I had it on tap and was floored. Had it two more times in the bottle and it was incredible because it was a little bit older."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm happy I picked it up, and it is definitely a well thought out and constructed beer. Hides the alcohol well and doesn't blow your tongue away with the hops, but I was a bit disappointed with what I felt was a bit one-dimensional. Worth a try (and I'd like to age one) but won't be dying to try it again."

"I was told to dink this beer not cold and that was my first tasting, The 2nd bottle I had was cold. Tasted much better, still like 90 minute IPA on steriods but not quite as concentrated easier to drink. 2nd bottle I would rate taste 5."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely a top-notch double IPA. The malt and hops are both big and bold, but, they balance each other and play-off each other well. And, the alcohol is well hidden for this level of ABV; so, it is also an easy drinking beer. It is well worth trying for hopheads and double IPA fans. This is a first class offering in the hyper competitive arena of big, hoppy beers."
"Overall, I really like this one. I had it a couple of years ago and liked it a lot but was curious what I would think the second time around. Still like it a lot. Rather unique and not surprising that it gets mixed reviews. I am in the positive camp!"
"Way too sweet with over a year of age on it. I prefer this beer fresh."

"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color, medium thin head of tiny white bubbles, seems to have decent legs and good lacing though. Aroma is a piney citrusy hoppy punch in the nose. Taste is quite sweet, almost to the point of cloying, with a syrupy heavy mouth feel. The aftertaste is still quite sweet with just a touch of pineapple to offset. The sweetness masks the alcohol incredibly well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not the """IPA""" I was expecting; a very heavy sweet, malt backbone, which compares more to a barleywine rather than other IPA. Very different from the 75, 90 MIPA."
"Overall - I've had an aged bottle previous to this and I can say that I much preferred it fresh. If you have a few bottles it's worth aging one to see how it changes but make sure you drink most of it fresh."

Even though this beer wasn't the greatest, it provided a nice experience and is something I would definitely have again, given the time."
""
""
"O: I have been waiting for years to try this bastard, but I always seemed to missed the boat. Now that I have had it I would have to say I am a little let down. To any IPA lover I say search it out but if you don’t find it, not a big loss, there are better IIPA’s out there."

"Got this bottle from HeB Plus in Kyle, Texas on shelf. Was surprised that it was right there on the shelf in beer area while I checked out if there is anything else special. I got two since it mentioned that it can be aged for a decade or so! I got an opportunity to taste the first bottle in my snifter glass. All I can summarize it is that it is holy grail of IPA world! It is so strong enough to drink the whole glass within an hour along with aged cheddar cheeses. Mouthfeel is wonderful and enjoying enough to know it is one of best double American ever made for IPA! God bless!"
"O- Few beers live up to the """hype", but I for one believe that 120 does. Will certainly get this again."

"With this high alcohol content you would think it would be to much, but oh how it's not. If I hear about this beer being on tap in Dallas, I'm there for the tapping. I love this beer. It pours with a small head but deep caramel color and it just tastes incredible. I also just bought a 4 pack and am aging them at different intervals. I hope everyone can try this beer."

"O – A beer I will not be revisiting. A challenging sipper, an over the top grain & hop bill that is reflected in the price and the taste, a novelty. An overwhelming brew, which is not a hop bomb but more barleywine. 1 bottle feels like I’ve been eating Halloween candy for hours. 2.5"
"O: Would drink again. I'd like to try it fresh. Expensive bottle, though."
""
""
""
""
"This is all about hop flavor which is still a rather blast of it and then the drying bitterness at the end but not too much at all. It still has such a great hop flavor that can't be described unless you taste it. Definitely worth the hype in my opinion. This beer is in another league compared to others."

"Big in every way! It's alot better than I thought it would be. Went down quicker than I thought as well. I was expecting this to be a mess but I applaud DFH for pulling this off so well. There was plenty of hops but I would drink this fresh due to the already sticky sweet malt."

"O - Not a beer to drink on your own. Share this with a few friends over a meal so the booze doesn't wear you down. Next time I think I would age a bottle for a few years to see if greater complexity can develop."

"O - What more can I say. I've never had anything like this in my relatively short beer drinking career. I can't compare it to the 60 or 90 minute because this beer is completely unlike them even while it is like them. I love this beer, it is a damn courageous undertaking for any brewer and it was created beautifully."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd put this in the category of a strong liquor, meant to be sipped in small quanities to sample the flavors, rather than enjoyed in any quantity. It really isn't worth $10 a bottle to consume all by yourself (even the 6-ounce half-pour I had splitting the bottle with a friend was wearing me down by the bottom of the glass) -- Get 5 buddies together and each of you can have 2 ounces, which will be enough to fully appreciate all the nuances without it getting old."

"(1 year aged) Unfair to label this a brew - it is much more... an after dinner drink, more like a port or Ice wine in how it should be savored. Drank slowly to enjoy all of the hoppy flavors we love coming at you larger than your normal hop experience. Pours with a nice mellow head and a deep shade of autumn color. Nose is sweet caramel and hops, with a definite presence of alcohol but to be expected. The taste is smoother than the aroma - while alcohol is present - it is not the first experience which is more sweet maybe a Belgian candy with floral to spicey hops present. Well done - nice to enjoy once in a while."
""
"This is an excellent beer, especially considering the amount of alcohol they tried to pack in to this bottle with a significant wallop. The alcohol presence is quite noticeable uopn first taste but it is a taste that grows on the drinker as the bottle descends into nothingness. Warning, not for the occasional drinker."
"I really don't care about a beer's appearance, color or feel. It's just about the taste. I'm a small town Texas boy with a love of a wide range of beer. I bought 3 of these to try out. Interestingly, the first I drank straight from the bottle - which, honestly, I prefer 90% of the time. But my first Dogfish Head 120 I hated. I thought it was horrible, and actually hard to even finish. I compared it at the time to how kerosene might taste. But a few nights later I poured it into a frozen glass. Wow. I have no idea what makes it different, but it was. It went from horrible to great, and after drinking the last one I just wish I had more. Truly one of my favorite beers I've ever had. I found it to indeed have a bitter taste, but a very smooth and not overly hoppy bitter taste. Hard to explain. Also - as the glass and beer got warmer, it got even better. Don't hesitate to try this one. But - give it a chance. I often find good beer takes a while to """come around""" and this was no exception. I don't know if this review will help you. I don't really speak beer talk, I just know what I like and I really liked Dogfish Head 120."

"120-Minute is the reason I stopped using the name """Double IPA""" for this category. Some people who use that name consider this beer more of an American Strong Ale or Barleywine. However, Imperial IPA is a perfect way to describe what 120-Minute does: extreme hops and extreme malt rolled into one fantastic brew."

"Incredibly unique beer. A monster. Borders on a Barleywine or even beyond. Is it the best IPA I’ve had? No, not even close. But I like it for how unique it is, for the experience. Sum is greater than the parts here."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Hard to be objective with a legend like 120. I've enjoyed many bottles over the years and have found that this is the only beer that actually becomes hoppy-er with age. All the sugars and alcohol seem to meld a bit with time and let some of the leaf show. Not with this fresh sample though, pure sugar and alcohol driven, smooth barleywine. Moonshine, rocket fuel, best shared."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass, bottled date 2012. This pours a small head slightly off white, color a nice copper. The smell are of strong hops, pine, obvious alcohol. The feel is medium to think, I can taste the alcohol right away. The taste is okay, a load of alcohol very noticeable, some burn, some hop bite but its overshadowed, a load of sweetness, this is different, pushes the boundaries of beer."

"Definitely not for everyone, but everyone needs to try it at least once. This is a beer that you can't judge immediately. You'll be set back by the abrasiveness at first, but as you develop your relationship you'll have your ups and your downs throughout. In the end you'll be left feeling perplexed yet enlightened and wanting (maybe needing) more. Definitely a starter drink and not to be tapped after 40 beers."

"Overall, what we enjoy most about this brew is the boldness of flavoring, and how fruity it is. We were a little disappointed that the hops didn’t hold up as well in either the nose or the taste, but the fruitiness really did surprise us. There are deep and syrupy notes which really help to cut the booze. Even with warmth the booze does not seem as strong as it actually is, which makes for a tasty, sippin’ treat."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with this one. For the polarizing reviews here and opinions in the forum, it was actually very good. I'll keep my other 2 in the cellar and test them with age in the future."
"Overall - Interesting that Dogfish Head calls this """the holy grail for hopheads""" if extreme bitterness is the measure of holiness. The hops come through, but they are so well balanced with the chocolately coffee malt I thought I was drinking a barley wine. The 18% ABV was warming and kicking my butt. Stood up well to a peppered ribeye steak. I'll enjoy this through the winter. A great find!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Yeah, it was good. Nothing to go crazy over, and if not for the limited availability, not really worth the price. I know, it's meant to be a bit one-dimensional when fresh, but I felt it was just a little too... one dimensional. Would be interesting in trying it aged."

"Dogfis Head knows how to market this thing. It is a beast and a costly beast indeed. Worth it to try once or twice, but in the end it'd be best to save the money for a pack of 90-minute."
"Lets get right to it people. This beer stands as one of the most unique brews I have ever had. A colossal 18-21%abv, an IPA that scares most away, but the ones that dare to try it are truly amazed. I would say it may not be something that a stereotypical """ hophead""" would potentially enjoy, because it does not possess the bite of hops that one would expect. Don't get me wrong, the hops are certainly present and ready to drop nuclear bombs on your palate, but it is a smooth, maple syrupy texture/taste that really makes this beer excel. Not a hint of alcohol, some mild heat going down, no burn in the throat whatsoever. It is not even overwhelming in any fashion, which of course is a positive considering the ABV and how easily this venture could have gone horribly wrong. Smooth, maple syrupy and full of hops, this beer is simply excellent."

"This was a hop monster through and through. I'm really quite amazed that they were able to pull off such a highly alcoholic beer that was even remotely balanced. Sure it was acidic, but it was palatable. Big props for that. The taste is something different, a little one note. To be expected for sure, since this is somewhat of a novelty. It's a good kind of novelty that I'll be trying again in the future."

"The dry hopping gives it such a rich aroma and fragrance that will stay with you. The high alcohol content needs to be monitored because it drinks very smooth for an Imperial IPA. It does have a nice back end bite with just enough bitterness to not be overwhelming. Definitely worth a try for any serious beer drinking."

"I've liked all of DFH's Minute series up until this point, but 120 Minute just seems too... unfinished and raw to be considered a viable beer at this point. I'd probably need to give this beer another five years before attempting to drink it again, and at that point it might as well be a barleywine. I love that you push the limits, Sam, but this is just something better stuck in a barrel for a while."

"It's a good thing for the sake of particular beers that folks tend to associate them with fond memories as opposed to legitimate quality."

"DFH 120 appears to be slightly hazy, with a golden brown/amber hue. It's head is only a thin sliver, but it is quite sticky and frothy. There seems to be some light carbonation, as I see bubbles rising from the bottom of my ordinary glass. Ultimately, the appearance is very good. The aroma is 'roasty,' and spicy, although I pick up a lot of pineapple and bitter citrus hop notes as well. Curiously, it seems the brew has a malt backbone to it, along the obvious truckload of hops. Now for the taste- wow! First and foremost, It really knocks you over with the alcohol presence, very full body, and thick, syrupy mouth feel. I was right about the malts... believe it or not, there is a good amount of malt sweetness ever-present in the flavor. For the hops... these are the more 'piney' hops that come right in with the malts. With the ABV and body, it bites so hard it's almost like taking a sip of hard liquor. I'd almost say there is some balance here, but once the finish kicks in and the beer is down the hatch, the very, very dry, bitter hops do take over completely. Not that I mind, you see. I knew exactly what I was in for when I bought this. A real treat for hop heads, American strong ale fans, and if you age this one, I'd imagine you'd come out with something similar to a Barley-wine. Buy Buy Buy!"
"Happy IPA Day!!"

"A sipper, but not reallyl difficult to drink. Very warming. This would be well suited to a frigid winter's night."

"Overall: Probably my first and last 120 Minute. Cool to try, way, WAY better bangs for my buck out there."

"Think of this almost more as a cordial in terms of how you would drink it. It's good, overall, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. I would drink it again, but won't be scouring as hard as I was to find this first bottle. Wonder what aging it would bring?"
""
""
""

"Curiosity got the best of me on this one. While it was a very great quality IPA, I have a hard time justifying buying a case of beer for over 40 dollars let alone 200, but I was given the opportunity to buy a bottle for 10 bones from a friend. One bottle had me feeling it. Very nice to sit with and sip on slowly. Should be served at a warmer temperature than most. Again, final regards are that this beer is very good but no where near worth what it is priced at. I'm pretty sure it's hand-bottled, which means that most of the money is just going to employees that haven't been replaced by machines yet. Good for the economy bad for my wallet."
""
"Overall: Very tasty and a rare treat here in California. Huge thanks to MykelJH for hooking me up with this bottle! Recommended to anybody who doesn't mind something different or a little bit of sweetness in their beers."

"Overall, I really enjoyed this offering from Dogfish Head. I'm a loyal follower of the brewery, and I expected nothing less. The complex flavors - while not as hoppy as I expected - were nonetheless satisfying and saturated the palate. Flavors were not TOO overwhelming, though. I'm looking forward to trying the 2nd bottle I bought in a year or two...depends on how long I can hold out...to see how the flavors develop and change with age!"
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, citrus fruit, and some mild nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with a definite alcohol kick with each sip. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but I am not really enjoying the nail polish remover aroma from this one."
"120 Minute IPA is thick too, sticky sweet. The carbonation is at a moderate level, allowing the beer to self clean itself off your palate. It's a great beer for sure, but one that I don't see myself buying too often because of the $1/oz price tag."

"Overall, I really liked this beer. It's exceptional and very unique. Like most of their stuff, it's bold as hell (I absolutely love the Dogfish philosophy). The price tag is a little rough at $9.00 for a 12 oz. bottle, but I know why that is--this thing has got to be very difficult to brew. This is definitely a once in a while treat, and a great one at that."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 D bottling(pretty fresh as my store got it in this week). Pours hazy golden orange color with a dense 1 finger off white head with very good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers, Pretty good lacing sticking to the glass, with plenty of alcohol legs as expected. Aromas of big pine, citrus rind, grass, lemon zest, grapefruit, honey, herbal, floral, earth, caramel, and a a bit of alcohol. Pretty nice aromas with some good balance and complexity. A lot less booze in the aromas than I expected; booziness seems to drop off a bit more as it reaches room temps. Taste of big citrus rind, lemon zest, pine, grapefruit, herbal, floral, honey, caramel, earth, and light herbal spiciness. Light amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus rind, grapefruit, pine, floral, caramel, honey, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor balance and complexity; with zero booze in the taste. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, oily, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Approaching syrup viscosity but it’s not a bad thing here; as the carbonation balances things out. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish. Goes down impressively smoothly. Overall this is a damn nice DIPA given what this actually is in terms of the style. I was quite impressed how smooth this was; with a nice hop flavor balance and absolutely no cloying sweetness at all. I am beginning to wonder why everyone cries that this one is horrible fresh. This is very well done considering all of the insanely over the top brewing and dry hopping it takes to create this one. Really enjoyable."
"Full bodied, low carbonation, with a bitter aftertaste. Definitely not as good as 60 minute or 90 minute IPA, but not that bad either."

"M: Definitely glad I split this bottle with my girlfriend because it's too big of a beer for me to have had alone on a weeknight! Very good though. Full-bodied, goes down smooth."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low for the style. Overall, I don't think it aged well at all and was approaching undrinkable. The lack of hoppiness just made it cloyingly sweet and boozy. It was kind of like a bad, really unbalanced, one dimensional barleywine. I've had it fresh and remember liking it better than this bottle. I'll make an effort to revisit a fresh bottle and update my review when I can find one."

"My review might not seem like it but I do enjoy 120 minute IPA, I'm just more aware of its flaws now. The last time I had this was sometime in 2009 when I was new to craft beers. My palate has changed alot since then. 120 is nice but I feel the alcohol overpowers everything else, making it a bit unbalanced. I would like more of the hops to shine through, especially with this being a fresh bottle."
""
"o- I give it a 4 overall because if it ages well I can see how it would be very good aged. I also think that considering how high powered this beer is, it's damn well balanced. I wish it we're a little less sweet and a bit more bitter, but alas."
"Its golden appearance entices you to take a wiff. The smell: sweet hops and booze. The taste is sweet, fruity, boozy, and of course HOPS! I love the mouthfeel; its low carbonation makes this feel more like a hop liquor than a beer. Overall, I recommend EVERY hop head taste this beer. But be warned, it's not for everyone. Cheers!"

"O: I've now had this aged and fresh, and I just really don't like this. I get it's an alcohol bomb, huge ABV...but it doesn't taste good. I'm giving it some points for creativity and pushing-the-limits-of-style panache...but again, it doesn't taste good. There are some other high gravity beers that are just far, far superior in the enjoyability department."

I wouldn't drink more that one but this is definitely a beer i would spend the money for. If you like the higher abv beers than this one is a dessert beer."
""
""
"Overall this beer does what it should do with an 18% ABV, but doesn't offer much flavor-wise. The bottle says that it is a hop heads' dream, but I am not tasting much hops. I have heard these get better with age, and I have a couple to put back for a later date, so we shall see..."
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, well, it smells of nail polish remover. In the taste, dry, pine like hops and alcohol, with notes of nail polish remover. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol and small hop presence in the aftertaste. It is like nail polish remover/ rubbing alcohol, with a touch of pine hops."

"O- For a 18% IPA this was very good, however I think I prefer sticking to the 90 + 75 minute. For it's abv, the beer was surprisingly easy to drink however the aroma and taste weren't anything that I thought was spectacular. A nice rarity to drink every once in awhile, but definitely not something I would drink regularly, especially considering it's price. For $7.25 for a 8oz serving though I can't complain (considering it's being sold for $12 at the stores)."
""

"O- This is rediculous and redonkulous!!! Bursts of caramel maltiness, tropical and citrusy fruitiness, and a shit ton of nasal passage cleansing booze!!! Glad I have some of these to put away to see how they develop over time. I had a 2007 in 2010 and it was really awesome! Really looking forward to reviewing another in a few years."

"Pours a dark golden amber with orange hues and a one finger slightly off white head. The aroma of grassy hops and booziness greets the nose. Grassy hops dominate upfront and transition into heavy sweet malt and then finishes with a piney bitterness and booze. Moderate carbonation is present with a heavy, syrupy body that coats the inside of the mouth. An extremely unique brew that is absolute alcohol bomb. Expect the heaviest malt backbone present in any IPA, which leads many to compare 120 Minute to barleywines rather than other IPA's. However the Dogfish Head IPA hop profile is plainly evident in this brew and this brew truly does remind me of an extreme version of 90 Minute IPA."

"If considering price and availability, I would grab a 4-pack of Olde School Barelywine (or better yet, a 4-pack of Burton Baton if taking beer style into consideration) for ~$13 than a single, 12oz bottle of 120 Minute IPA for $9. If nothing else, it was a nice birthday treat!"

"O- This is a very special beer and worth getting a 4 pack of to share with friends. It's obviously not something to drink frequently but great for special occasions. I can't give it super high ratings because the alcohol smell/flavor just is not possible to balance out with any amount of hops/malt and therefore I can't consider it as enjoyable as some of my favorite IPA/DIPA's. But like I said it's a special beer and very good."

Yes, IMO this beer is better AGED!"

"Overall, the beer is fantastic. The price is what it is for a reason; its amazing. Possibly the best IPA in the world. Dogfish has really set the bar with this beer."

"Pours a hazy amber color, a deep color for an IPA. The cream head stands a half inch tall in my DFH signature glass. It recedes to a thick ring and a couple rocky islands of foam. The aroma is hoppy: grassy, citric, piney. Not actually as hoppy as I expected. There is also a light sweetness in the aroma. The first taste is floral bitterness, with a touch of malt. Next I get pine and syrupey flavors. As it leaves the palate, I get a touch of citrus and a lot of alcohol warmth. There is a flavor in this that I dislike, it's about 2/3 the way through, it seems medicinal but that may not be a perfect description. The mouthfeel is one of the thickest I've tred for an IPA, no suprise there, but the body is slightly lightened by a ticklish carbonation. This isn't exactly what I expected it to be, but that seems to be how DFH works, they make delicious things that make you scratch your head a bit. Okay, time or a glass of water, this sucker is boozy."
"Overall considering this I would gladly pay the 8 bucks to try it in the bottle to see if it's close to this experience but its really nothing to seek out again strictly novelty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: It's definitely a big boy, but this is smooth as hell. Big and malty upfront with a firm and piny hoppy backbone. Alcohol is definitely there, but it's remarkably well hidden. Mouthfeel has just enough prickly carbonation to hold down the syrupy ness. Really well done."

"Additionally, this is a fresh keg and as such, will be more aggressive in the hop notes and weaker in the malt. Need to try it aged a few years or even months. Definitely a """must try""" beer, even for malt heads like me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to rate to style as this is a category-defying brew. It is what it is and works on its own terms. SO much better than the bottle I had several years ago."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is good beer but not for everyone, you want to talk about an acquired taste this is it. I love IPA's but this one is a little tough to put at the top of the food chain. Granted it is a blessing to have because rarely you can get a buzz like this out of one glass. Salud!"
""
""
"Overall this is an impressive brew given the ABV of ~ 18%. I honestly was expecting more of a one-track booziness. Instead there was some actual balance. I suspect cellaring for almost a year definitely helped to mellow out the alcohol."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Huge hop flavor and strong booze, but the body is able to hold it all and the overall beer feels well put together."
""
""
"Mouthfeel was tangy and very warming. Overall I prefer this beer fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll admit that the beer cost $10.50 a pour (which were into 12 oz. snifters, that were given for keeps to the customers), but overall it was well worth the cost. I admit that I enjoyed this beer after a hard day's work at the office and arrived 5 minutes before the keg was """tapped," so my taste could have hardly been experienced in a more favorable light. If on draft, I would strongly recommend this beer to anyone who loves the finer qualities of the beverage. I cannot speak for the bottled version, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the finer qualities of this beer were lost in the bottling process (as great as it still may be)."
""
"This was a decent beer, but I was a little disappointed. It notes that it is the holy grail for hop heads but I thought the hop presence was greatly lacking. Also, the beer becomes more and more out of balance as it goes on leaving basically just an alcohol taste toward the end."

"an interesting beer, and im very interested to see how this ages, but something im dying to buy more of. i thought the bottle/ batch i had years ago was better..."
""

"It's a reasonably drinkable beer, given the IBU and ABV. It's a sipper for a cold day. But it's something you've got to try. It's not the best beer on the planet, but more of a sideshow, but you'll be glad you tried it."
"O: I gave this a 5.0 because Dogfish Head obviously made a very quality beer that checks off a number of rare boxes. It's 18 percent alcohol, hoppy to a point of extremes and still tastes really good. If I was looking for a really great IPA, this wouldn't be what I'd grab. But I don't think that's what Dogfish Head was going for when they made this. This is a good, interesting beer that crosses beer styles to sit with overall quality beers, instead of reigning in a certain niche. Sure, it's challenging to drink, but I like that a lot. I want something to stick out in beers I drink. This is certainly no session beer. This is one that you're going to fight with a little at first. However, it'll soon have you singing its praises and wanting more -- if you like challenging beers. If you want a session beer, keep a movin'."

"18 f***ing percent. Take the sweetness of 90 min’s malt (which I love–brown sugar and currants but not even overwhelming) and go absolutely crazy so that the booze and residual sugar are so goddamn huge that the hops are rendered undetectable. IPA is a lie, in fact the whole thing is rediculous. Not very good, but interesting I guess. The final impression is medium bodied Maple sap fermented with brewers yeast."

"O: What an impressive specimen!  I applaud DFH for what it has accomplished here.  Getting a beer to 18% ABV while maintaining a very good aroma, flavor profile, and insane drinkability is an amazing task.  Does it fit the style?  No, but styles be damned.  This is a brewing work of art.  "

"18% etoh! 120 IBU's! This is a beer to be enjoyed, not chugged! This is a special beer to be shared and savored like Sam Adams Utopia. The 2 are very similar except 120 is carbonated. A very heavy beer. This beer is one of my favs to start the night out with! Every year I stay at the Crosswinds Motel, right next to the Dogfish brewery/flagship store in DE, just to get my Dogfish fill!"
""
"O - I find it hard to give this beer a rating because it is so very different from any other IPA out there. I shy away from really sweet beers (English BW, Quads, etc.) but I thought this wasn't too bad. I had it fresh in hopes that some of the hops would cut the sweetness, but I think the freshness mostly just kept the alcohol heat. I have a few in the cellar from the last couple of years, so I look forward to trying it aged for a few years to compare. It's definitely a sipper, but pretty good and unique."
""
"I love Dogfish Head and enjoyed the 120 minute overall. It's really too big to evaluate by comparing to other beers and is more of a hybrid beer/champagne/sipping spirit. Great smell of big ABV when poured along with notes of citrus remaining you it's an IPA. Lighter amber appearance is accompanied by noticeable carbonation, which is also evident when you first sip. Surprisingly smooth taste for such a big IPA and enjoyable finish. By no means a session beer, but a wonderful experience drinking this beer."

"Overall, I enjoy this beer, and it's great for the style, but there are too many alternatives that cost SO much less. If you are big on ABV and want to have a 1 drink night, this is PERFECT!"
""
"O: Given its cost, I probably wouldn't buy this often. The ABV is scary, especially when you consider how smooth of a drink it is. I'd say the ABV hits you more readily in the DFH Santo Palo Marron, which is only 2/3 of this brew's ABV. Taste-wise, probably not the best Imperial IPA, but very good nonetheless."

"Hit the shelves this morning, poured to pint glass the beer is a crystal clear golden amber with a small 1/2 finger white head, little retention and virtually no lacing. The nose is very muted, no hop character whatsoever, malty with clear caramel malt character. Bready. Hint of abv. The taste is a disappointment. Immediately upon the palete is a strong alcohol heat, no hiding it. Strong and aggressive. Mildly bitter with a lot of bready malt, again little hops. Way to strong and sweet, unbalanced. Medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, this is a boozy beer. Too expensive and not enjoyable. I will not be back."

"Dogfish Head never ceases to amaze. The first impression of this brew is as an imperial/double IPA. Fascinated, I swirled around in my glass then took a sip being overwhelmed by my taste buds. This brought about a surprising, yet heated, sensation not expected from the average beer. With an ABV of 18% this brew can catch you off guard, but if you are lucky enough to enjoy this selection then savor the moment!"

"Poured into a 13 OZ tulip, bottled in 2011u. Pours a clear orange red, with a two inch sticky white head, with plenty of lacing. Smell is huge apricot, tangerine, hard candy, grapefruit, and booze. Taste is wow Hardy candy, boiled grapefruit, and baked apricot. Body is medium large, with enough life considering the giant ABV, not overly dry, and a sipper for sure. This is a legend of a beer, that could use a few more years to mature."

"O- This is what an Imperial IPA should be judge against from now on."
""
""
"It pours out a nice, red-orange color with an expectantly small head that quickly drops to wisps. The aroma is very sweet and boozy, smelling more like a brandy then a beer. The taste, again, is closer to booze than beer. There's a little bit of hops, but it's really tastes a lot like brandy. I poured out some Remy VSOP to confirm my suspicions. Any way, it is still pretty good tasting, with just a bit of prickly hops on the backend, and plenty of sweetness and fruit on the front. The mouthfeel is thick with a decent level of carbonation. Overall, it's just too damn sweet without other dimensions to even it out."
""
""
""
""

"O A bit disappointed, best thing you can say about this is it hides the booze very well."
"A definite sipper at 20%! You may not notice a boozy burn, but the buzz will catch you fast."

"Took me a few years to track this one down, but I'm not disappointed in the slightest. Along with Red & White, the best beer I've tasted from Dogfish Head."
"O: This brew's a sipper. A bit to sweet. Hops are a bit undertone even if the fruity scent is definitely nice. Would probably age well."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was very decadent, very smooth, very strong (this and their WW Stout are tied for the strongest beer I've ever had); I really enjoyed it even though it wasn't what I expected - I've had a to come back to this after having had the 90 minute IPA, and later still even tasting them in succession, b/c I realize how much better the 90 minute IPA is than the 120 minute IPA."

"As one of the reviewers below said, Dogfish head's 60 minute was one of the beers that turned me toward craft brews, and later, forever forsaking the NASCAR fair. Somehow, I'd missed the 120 minute until now. Among my beer loving friends, it has not been loved. Liked, perhaps, but nothing of the fan-fair I'd expect from a beer with even more (!) hops. I have come to find that it is in fact possible to over hop a beer. The 120 Minute was accused of this, and I echo the sentiment. That is not to say, by any means, that I don't enjoy the beer. I really like it and certainly recommend it. I'd even say it's come to enjoy a certain celebrity status, and perhaps should be tried at least once for that reason. But, lacking much else in complexity, this is a pure hopper, and it is strong. I've given this a slightly higher overall mark than I did for it's other sub-catagories, and I'd have to admit I'm not sure why. I can tell you two things though. The first is that this isn't complex; the smell is hoppy, so is the appearance and the taste, not much more needs to be said. The second is that I haven't had a good beer in a while, so having some type of quality round out my evening is a major plus, even if the hops are a bit smothering."

"Overall, I thought this was a great brew. Dogfish Head knew what they were doing with this one. Sam knocked it out of the park. While this beer clocks in at a whopping 120 ibu's... I do wish that it was more of a hop bomb. It is on the sweeter side for sure. If I could critique it at all, it would be to let the hops shine through a little bit more. Other than that, a great beer and I will be seeking it out in the future."

"12oz bottle """Bottled in 2012""". Pours amber-orange with nice clarity, thin white head as expected that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are citric and floral hop, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, with caramel and grainy malts. Tastes are complex with notes of sweet fresh pineapple, citrus, mango, grapefruit, caramel, and honey. It's sweet with a large amount of booze that is noticeable. I was surprised at the lack of bitterness on the finish - the sweetness rides right on through the finish. It goes down too easy for the enormous ABV, while being creamy, smooth, and full bodied. Towards the end as the ale warms, the alcohol gets hot. Overall, this was a treat I've wanted to try for some time, but never was at the right place at the right time. At $10 a bottle I probably wouldn't get it again, but definitely glad I finally got to try it!"
"D: not sure if this is too young or what, but im getting almost an unpalatable amount of heat. however, some sips are a bit more tame and i can really get the balance between a shitload of hops and a shitload of malt. sort of torn here. looking forward to trying this again with a few years to tame out the heat."
""
""
"Overall: definitely a fantastic beer, certainly more of a barleywine than Imperial IPA, but very unique in its flavors and certainly an experience worth having. It would be very interesting to collect/age these for a few years and do a vertical tasting. DFH recommends trying it with some age on it, so whenever they have another release, I'll try to make that happen."
""
""
"O: I really enjoy this beer. It's more of an english-american fusion barleywine rather than an IPA. Threw a 4-pack of last years in the cellar definitely throwing a few in the cellar this year."
""
""
"A slow-drinking IPA for sure. I enjoyed it."
""
"Aged 1 bottle for about a year. It improves incredibly well with age. The sweetness calms down a bit, but is definitely still present. I recommend aging this beer to get the best results."
"overall not my favorite IPA but a good offering from dogfish. Won't go out of my way to track this down but if offered why not."
""
""
""

"Overall. I had to try it, despite the $9 price tag. No need to buy another one. It'll be a long evening sippy beer."

Its an experience, and I was glad I split the bottle, because I'm not sure I'd be able to finish it myself. A bit too boozy for me, but is interestingly balanced. We'll see if I ever get in the state of mind to buy another $9 12oz bottle."

"Not the traditional IPA by any means. It poured a deep amber, and gave off a smell of solid alcohol, a step away from the usual flowery wave that comes with IPA's. Inhalation though was the real factor which gives this beer all of the esteem that Dogfish places behind it. First taste, is that of a very light IPA, after which it puts your taste buds into a race, firing flavor after flavor at you. The flavor reaches a peak about 10 seconds after you swallow, when it enters the final wave of a citrus. Don't look to this for a session, because the near 18% when mixed with the overall show-stopper stature of this brew puts all subsequent beers in a lower light. If you consider yourself an IPA person, than this should become your pride and joy, after you experience the complexity of the flavor which honestly is in a league of its' own."

"Pours a light amber with a very slight white head. Nice aroma. Alcohol for sure, but pleasant booze. Big citrus notes as well, grapefruit, orange peel. Some honey too. Really complex flavor profile, as you'd expect. Really hoppy, really malty and really boozy all at the same time. Citrus dominates the hop profile with sweet and tangy grapefruit and orange hops, but a bit of pine as well. No bitterness. Really sweet sticky malt. Caramel and even a bit of toffee, but it fades and the hops take over more the further into the beer you get. Then there is an overlying presence of alcohol throughout the entire flavor profile. It's quite tasty tho and doesn't overpower. Very viscous and sticky. It's a very complex and unique brew and definitely worth a try or 3."

"Overall not as brutally hoppy as I had anticipated. Have had hoppier brews, but this one has a strong body that screams to be aged. Would consider it more of a barley wine than an imperial IPA."

"Served on-tap and poured in a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, hazy orange marmalade color with a frothy, dense, inch high head that is light tan in color and has very decent retention and cling. Aromas are a hophead's dream, with a blast of pine tassels and resiny, sticky, green fresh hops, balanced with a slight grapefruit citrus characteristic and subtle malt presence. Flavors are huge, and they explode the palate. Robust caramel malt backbone that is quickly surrounded by a roasted character that gives rise to the floral and resiny hops that abound. Wet, green, and heavy are the best descriptors I can give for the hops presence, with a slick, oily feel on the palate. The citrus from the aromas becomes much more subtle on the palate, being slightly absorbed into the malt presence and being somewhat overowered by the solid booze presence. Wow, this is a heavy hitter. The aftertaste is a rich tang of malt, with some peppery hops character making itself known. The finish is slick and rich, giving a slow recession off the palate. It really allows you to take it all in before the tongue recovers for another sip. This is a tasy brew!"
""
""
"Overall – This was a very nice beer, although I was a little disappointed in the hop level; it was less hoppy then I would have liked. It may have been the heavy malt backbone that hid some of the hop flavor, but to me this was no more hoppy then their 90 min IPA. Taking price into consideration I would take 90 min IPA over this any day. The 120 was well worth a try and one to have very sparingly on special occasions."
""
""
""
"O- I was expecting worse. I couldn't drink a lot of this but one glass is a good beer to have. I would recommend trying this one out but do t think you are going to get a normal ipa, when its not really one at all."
"O: Overall, not quite what I was expecting. All the different aspects of this beer are different score and create different feeling in me. I wanted to like this beer more than I do - wanted to rate it 5 however can't. Still is a decent beer and would tell friends to give it a try."
""
""
"The label calls this brew """The Imperial Indian Pale Ale", and it is intense. Pouring a hazy orange with some peach highlights, a 1/2 inch of ivory colored head leaves lots of lace. Piney and citrusy resin aromas burst from the tulip-shaped glass, with very noticeable hints of alcohol (nail polish) and a little earthiness. Super sweet brew, hints of honey, cherry, pinecone, citrus and alcohol. A chewy, big body with low amounts of carbonation becomes more complex and rewarding as it warms. Definitely approach this brew with caution, not even some of you hop heads will like the subtleties, but do approach with an open mind, and you will be rewarded!"
""
""
"Overall: If you're a huge fan of an IPA and are hoping for a significant hop flavor, you're in for a let down. It's worth a try, if you ask me, but not nearly what I was expecting and hoping for."

"Mouthfeel is exceptional considering the ABV- medium bodied with medium carbonation. Very interesting brew that should be tried if found."

"Seems like finding this beer is like finding the lost city of Atlantis. It ranks in my top 5 without a doubt. It pours a gorgeous deep amber and has a hoppy nose. A bit heavy on the mouthfeel and a bit of a heavy finish, albiet a plesant one. Very hoppy, in the tradition of true ipas"
""
"Pours a beautiful clear grapefruit red-orange. Smells of wet dog and slight citrus, booze, toffee. Alcohol is heavy here, but the hops are still present with a huge sweet grapefruit booze flavor. What a monster beer. Thick mouthfeel for an IPA, but what do you expect at 18%. Had fresh and aged 6 months. I had thought the aged was slightly better, but did not taste at the same time so tough to tell. Not sure, but would probably put this in the barleywine category. This one will getchya!"
""
"I really enjoyed this one this time. It was nothing like the cloying, syrupy sweet hop juice I remembered from my first experience. I will want to get some more. Not sure about aging this though, though the label suggests doing so? The booze might mellow, but so too would the hops, which could make it sweet like the first one I had?"

"O: Just too strong at 18% ABV to be easy to drink. I have enjoyed this beer the couple of times I have tried it but it just is not one of my favorites in the style - too sweet and not quite enough bitterness for me."
"This poured a dark and cloudy bronze orange with a one finger width off-white head.Man this is cloudy! Lots of floaters. Lacing is distributed randomly around the glass. Smells like an orange liqueur, although the alcohol has been muted a bit. OOOH! This is delicious. The alcohol is much more hidden than i remember. Now, the bitterness has been replaced with sweetness. The hops ARE this beer, but the hops as you know them have changed. This is an interesting and syrupy elixer. The extreme stupid beer that is 120 minutes fresh has butterflyed into a delicious barleywine. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear medium red orange amber. Thin fine off-white head with good retention (of what little is there!) and lacing. Aroma is very close to a barley wine, sweet and caramel hops and herbal hops. Flavor is as intense as I expected. Sweet malt and alcohol up front, very bitter. A malty finish with a hop kick. At this point, it is interesting to drink, but a bit over the top in bitterness and alcohol. I'm looking forward to tracking this through time as it mellows. Very different and interesting."
""
""
"Overall this is a surprisingly good beer, I was expecting something like hop infused paint thinner but instead I got a smooth tasty beer. While the abv definitely makes this one a sipper, I recommend trying this one."

""

""

""
""
"O- This is my second endeavor with this beer, but my friends 4th. We both believe it is way more drinkable now than ever before. This is probably due to our changing palettes. This is not a best in class, but really a touchstone. You can track your drinking prowess by revisiting this beer. This is the beer drinkers beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its tough to rate this one. It really isn't as harsh as it could be, and I'm guessing the softness of the tap may have something to do with that. However, I've tasted beers into the 15% range that were incredibly balanced. I know this is harder, but there is just about ZERO balance in this bomb. 'Hop vodka' is a little harsh, but don't attempt this one without a wingman."
""
"This bottle aged 21 months before serving and is far and away superior to the one I had fresh. The alcohol in the fresh bottle totally overwhelmed the experience. This one, however, did seem to assume qualities of a strong barleywine. I have left two other bottles to age for comparison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Shared with two others, the samples were poured into a snifter. Pouring a beautiful copper color, the ale gave a strong, pleasant, citrusy aroma. The initial taste is citrus, almost like a thick citrus fruit drink. To an extent, citric acid almost seems present. The hops do not become apparent until the back of the mouth. It makes for complex drink. Somewhat thick in its texture, the ale possesses a sweet strong alcohol flavor that permeates a pleasant experience. The flavor will please more than hop heads."

"7/22/11 bottle Poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Appearance is beautiful, little to no head, but an awesome copper color. Very strong alcohol presence, but extremely inviting. Not as much citrus and floral notes as 90 Minute, but this is a totally different beer. The taste is sweet, syrupy, hints of carmel. Tons of sugar, aging would tame it a bit. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, great carbonation in my opinion. Overall, this is my first 120, so anything was possible. The hype is there, try this one with caution."

"Overall I gave it a 4.5, but thats only because in a couple of years it will improve, there is literally nothing wrong with it now."
""
"Overall: I had a 4 year old version of this last year and was blown away, so I was curious to see what it tasted like fresh; I was not unhappy with the results. I have to say I really expected the alcohol taste to come through given what other people have written for reviews, but I think it was barely noticeable which is noteworthy given the huge potency. For a beer this strong, this is a great example of the complexity and craft that dogfish puts in its beer. while its a bit too sweet to give a perfect rating, I would definitely go out of my way to get this, especially to age."
"I think this easily stands up to Pliny the Elder or any other AIPA I've had. Not sessionable but extremely tasty and not as boozy as the ABV (and other reviews) suggest."

"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is about as drinkable as an 18% ABV DIPA can get. And while it is a sipper, it is surprisingly drinkable. The body is thick, full, sticky, and a bit syrupy. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but really has its hands full keeping the body a consumable product."

"Overall, it was a solid beer and very balanced. A great example of an extreme beer with great balance. Not as hoppy as I expected, but I had been warned before. Still quite nice. I'd be up to pick this up again to see how age treats it. Really great to try at least once."
"O: A memorable beer. I'm glad they serve it in 12 oz bottles because you couldn't drink too much of it--but this definitely warms you on a winter night similar to a heavy stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As far as super high octane beers go the alcohol is hidden quite well with it's 18% abv. Don't get me wrong, it's there and it's pretty apparent but I've had 15% beers that didn't hide the booze as well as 120 does. Sweet, sugary malts really showcase on the beer rather than the hops. I give it a 4/5 for giving me a really quick buzz."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not really sure what to make of this. It's definitely interesting. I feel like the hop flavor is nice but overpowered by the alcohol. I love aggressive beers but, for me, it's too boozy and isn't that much fun to drink, I split this with two friends and felt like I had enough. It's worth a try just for the experience though. Definitely some props to DFH for pushing the envelope of the style."

""
""
"O- an excellent beer. Extreme flavors that work together"
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, I was really surprised with how much I liked this one. I had heard about it being a sweet, boozy mess, but I think considering the amount of alcohol and hops, it is a very well balanced beer with lots of great flavors. I had this one fresh, and have some more to age. I really wish this was easier to get, because even fresh, this would be a nice occasional treat"
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's like the 90 minute on steroids. The malt character is intense and lends to a more barley wine-like flavor. The hops are more mild but noticeable. It's incredibly boozy, but in a good way in my opinion. I'm sure age would mellow this out big time. If I can ever come across it again, I will definitely be buying a few more."
""
"I truly enjoyed this beer. I am not sure if it had to do with the setting – Stowe Vt., snow falling, music playing, hanging with family - or the fact that this only cost me $3.50. Regardless, this is a beer that should be enjoyed, contemplated, and reflected upon. It is truly one of a kind and I will be looking forward to trying different vintages of it."
""
""
""
""
"Never had this on tap and it's been years since I had a bottle of it. It's a bit hot, but definitely hop dominant and a unique experience. Worth a try. Excellent beer...minus the burn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice. It can appeal to those that like a sipping liquer that want a hop forward brew. Pricey though at $12/10 oz. Yikes. Glad to enjoy this sipper once but not something I'd seek out often for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer definitely tastes strong, but a small fraction of the alcohol is masked from the taste and there is enough bitterness to counteract all of the malty sweetness. It’s not a bad sipping beer if you prefer IPAs over barleywines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- an excellent beer. Extreme flavors, and they work"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is just way out of balance right now. It shows signs of life hiding, but they don't stand a chance under the solvent overload. 2.5"
""
""
"O: I always heard great things about this brew, but then read recent threads with """polarized""" opinions. I definitely stand with those who think this beer is a great one. (I only wish it weren't so hard to find!) Get a bottle and see for your self!"
"O - Despite my interjection, my dad served it to me refrigerated. I wonder what it would have tasted like at a higher temperature. I will say this, I'm already feeling tipsy as I write this. Nevertheless, it was pretty good. Certainly not something I would fork over $10 to try again, especially when the 90 Minute is so much better. Glad I tried it, but that will be all for now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-It's good. It could never be a house beer for me, as in I would keep it on hand and crack one in the evenings, but I did enjoy tasting this beer very much. If you have never tried it and get the opportunity, try it for sure."
""
""
""
""
"O: Age has made this one awesome! I have 2 more from this vintage and 4 more from late 2011. I'll try one of the new ones in a year. Had an '08 in mid '09 and it was too hot, so hold on to these for as long as you can! I can't wait for EBF in Feb. for a draft !"
"Overall, this is a very well brew high abv craft. It is not an attempt to cram as much alcohol with zero concern for flavor, it is a very well balanced craft, done very well as expected from DFH"
""
"Fresh, this is way too strong and completely un-nuanced. Age at least a year to bring all the flavors together and get them to coalesce into a fine marriage."
""
""

"O - I have no clue what this will be like when aged, but hope it is better. I expected more from this beer considering all the hype. Sad that the little hops which are there now will fade with time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O - sip, sip, sip. I do not want to drink the 2011 version again anytime soon. That thing needs some age on it. Got a bottle a few months ago and plan to hold on to it for at least a couple of years. Hopefully the hops will mellow out and then other aromas and flavors will come out. Hope it becomes something more like the beer I had a couple of years ago."
""
"Poured into a snifter. A descent amount of head for the abv. 1""" of solid thick tan head with tight bubbles. Nice golden color to almost golden/amber. For the high alcohol content I got a nice mount of carbonation. Thick. Syrup. Hops. Hops. Malt. Caramel. Heavy citrus. Dark fruit. Coats the tongue. Over all a must try."
""
""
""
""
"I was a bit let down by this beer. I am a big fan of the brewer and 90 minute but was hoping for something alon the lines of a dreadnaught with massive complex aroma of pine, citrus and floral along with the taste. Maybe I should have let it age? 2nd bottle I've had"
""
""
"O-drank this out of a very small sniffer glass for New Years. Drank it at the pace I would enjoy a digestif. One of the best beers I have ever had, so complex, drinkable but I wanted to sip it to savor. I am cellaring a 2011 vintage for as long as possible to compare."
""
"Overall, it's a sipper for certain. Big, bold and aggressive. It's a bit green at this point, but I have a few bottles and I'm planning to sit on them and see how this one mellows with age."
""
""
"O: this is an extreme beer, very good and one every BA must try. It's very complex. While an IPA it's not exactly a hop bomb as expected by an IPA given the absurd amount of malt they must use to get their yeast to get this thing to 18%. A very interesting accomplishment of a beer."
""

""
""
""
""

"O – Crazy tasty brew here. Definitely a sipper. This one will knock you on your ass. Great all around."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of those beers you must drink before you die."
""
"120 pours a dark hazy cooper color with little head. This beer smells like a plant, very hoppy. The taste is very hoppy with a nice dogfish head like malty background. I thought it was easy to drink butthe alchool sneaks up. overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Another TIPA and another one where I fail to see this as a desirable beer. But I once felt this way about barleywines until I warmed up to them. This beer will be hard to finish as I think the one sip my wife took is all she'll want."
"Enjoy!"
""
"Low carbonation and thin head. Strong alcohol tastes as well as background hops. Good beer but not sure you can't get the same impacts, flavors, ABV by drinking barleywines. Hard to live up to the hype. Clearly a slow sipping beer important to serve at the proper temperature to allow the flavors to be released."
"Overall: A once in a lifetime experience with this beer. I am glad I tried it, but I would probably not drink this one again. It was great for what the beer was, but it just too big to call a traditional Imperial IPA. Maybe this would be along the line of a Quadruple IPA, not a double IPA if the style existed."
""
""
"O: This is an extremely unique DIPA, but I'm not sure I will rush to pick up a bottle next year. This is a very good beer, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it, but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed. When I think DIPA, I automatically think of big, resinous, citrusy hop flavors, of which this ale doesn't really display all that many. The malt dominates this one, and while I would expect that of a Belgian quad or a Belgian strong dark ale, I would not expect that of an American DIPA. Still, this is an interesting ale that is worth a try."
"O- From what I had heard about the sweetness of this beer I didn't think I would like it. However, I did assume I would be able to distinguish some redeeming qualities. I have failed to do so, other than its appearance."
"2008 :is much darker, more of an amber color. the aroma is maltier and boozier. taste is sweeter, the hops have faded a bit but still provide a lingering aftertaste. some brown sugar notes have moved in."
""
""
""
"O - A sipper. Too sweet and too boozy to drink particularly fast. It's okay, but for the price there's no way I'd buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very odd flavor profile for the style as the hops are hard to notice. Maybe my bottle was old but this one was much sweeter than I expected and a little off the style guidelines"
""
""
"I've had a lot of Dogfish ales and this is the best one yet! The taste doesn't like the 18% ABV that it is. Very impressed with the price compared to other beers in the ABV range. The hops taste is strong but not overwhelming. Overall great beer and very satisfying!"
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a completely different and interesting interpretation of an IPA. A bit too boozy at this age. I would love to see how this evolves over time."
""
"Loved it and would pick this off the shelf any time I found it. Not sure about drinking more than one or two, I don't think I would be sober enough to taste the third but who's counting."
""
""
""
""
"pours a hazy amber red with a paperthin head into my bruery tulip. Aroma of alcohol vanilla, bananas, and cherries. Taste follows nose but the alcohol isnt as present. Smoother than i expected, not a bad beer, i was expecting it to taste like an american barleywine but this is much better than any other barleywine i have ever had. very good"
""
"O: I loved it, more than I thought I would. It's definitely over the top for an IPA, but it really works for me. The hop profile is great and tue sweetness only seems to back it up. I would drink this regularly if I could afford to..."
""
""
""
"Overall: I probably would not buy this again as I prefer both 60 and 90 minute as they are true IPA's, however, this is definitely something to try at least once. I definitely like their World Wide Stout better in terms of their limited ageable offerings."
"Overall- I truly do not think DFH could make a bad beer. Do NOT drink this beer cold! Let it warm up and it completely changes."
""
"O – Slow sipping, but complex and delicious. Think whisky IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank 3/4 of the bottle and my girlfriend polished off the rest. After that much, I was pretty much half in the bag. This beer is no joke. It's like haymaker with brass knuckles. Dogfish Head 120 is definitely something to experience at least once if you can get your hands on it. However, consume this in moderation. One bottle is more than enough and this is definitely not for your average suds-sipper."
""
""
""
""
"No head or lacing to be found on any of the variations that I have tried. Generally dark amber in color, and a bit viscous in appearance and mouthfeel. This is a sipping beer when it's fresh, and almost a session beer (seriously) when it's aged. Recommended."
""
"Pours a clear orange honey golden with a low dense golden head. The initial cap liftoff unleashes a sharp, fragrant cloud of aroma, and my anticipation is heightened. Once in the glass, the aroma changes quite a bit however, with the resinous hops becoming more muted behind sweet fruit malts. The palate is thick and sticky, with intense hop character married to honey-sweet malts reminiscent of Madeira. As sweet as it is hoppy, this will not be to everyone’s taste, but there is almost no other way to support such a supersaturation of hops. This is a unique beer experience to be certain, one to be savoured and contemplated in an unhurried way. Quite remarkable really."
"O: Well this is all hype in my eyes. Overall the taste doesn't come together as the booze dominates and the hops all bitterness on the backend. Maybe an aged one that has turned into a quasi barleywine would be much better, but I can't say for sure. I have one in the cellar so we'll have to see."
""
""
""
"This beer is insane!! Poured nicely with a huge head in my snifter. Dark orange no clarity! As soon as I poured it I can smell the Alkyhol!! Can finish a bottle on my own but can't wait see what some age will do to this beer! The hops bite my palate with every sip! This beer is too boozy to figure it out!"
"O: The sweet malt flavor goes a long way in complementing the powerful, bitter alcohol and hops. Undeniably a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll be back in a month or so with a review of a fresh one. I'm kindof let down with this one right now."
"Mouthfeel: there is a burn from the high ABV. but it is sweet and flavorful feeling to compliment this ale. Which makes it a great brew to enjoy and share a sip with a loved one. Great Job DFH again 9 out 10. I would be interested in trying it barrel aged."

"Pours a clear deep copper color with little to no head what so ever, a thin lace of small tight knit bubbles created from the little visible carbonation rising from the bottle of the glass. Huge grapefruit hops slam the face, lemon citrus all over the place, a subtle but present dark fruit aroma also. Earthy, tobacco, piny wood characters follow as the beer warms up. A spice like scent is created from the bready sugary malt meeting with the bold alcohol scent. So complex, the nose on this beer is insane. Caramalized fruit explodes on the tongue. Bold sugar meet grapefruits, tobacco, sweet fruits and subtle alcohol. Gigantic on body and feel, through the roof. Subtle and sweet despite the 18%, you only really feel the booze through the heat not in taste or on the nose. Overall; this beer is insane, its aggressive with hops, malts , alcohol and sugar. Totally worth trying, this was an extremely intense experience."
"This obviously isn't an everyday sort of beer. It also isn't an everyday DIPA. For being an extreme version of an already """extreme beer""" style, this beer works surprisingly well. It is worth trying once, even if you aren't a hop head. I am very curious to see how it tastes with some age on it. I already have a bottle in my cellar that I've been aging for 2 years. I'll keep it down there for a bit longer before I open it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not bad but not sure it lives up to the hype. Was expecting alot more hops but I think the high alcohol content stomps some of the other flavor. Will definitely buy a bottle to see how it ages."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I took a wiff right out of the bottle and got a very strong citrus scent. It poured nicely into snifter with a small head which died down fairly quickly. From the moment this beer enters your mouth, your pallet is assailed with intense everything. Very bitter hoppiness, some subtle robust maltiness to it, and somewhat-strong ethanol taste/scent. Despite the intensiveness of the flavors, this beer was surprisingly well balanced. Will buy again next year."

"The feel of this beer is big all around. The force of this beer as it mahandles your pallet is something else. I had to take my time with this one.

"Have to give them credit for effort but because of the high alcohol content any semblence of balance is lost. Lots of people love the beer but I have to figure it is because of the rarity and the high alcohol, not really the flavor. Even with all the hops I think the beer is too sweet but that has to be expected with the high alcohol. I think the 90 minute is a much better beer."

"CHEERS"

"O - An interesting beer indeed. No doubt about it, it's a sipper. This drinks more like a brandy or liquer than a beer. As a DIPA, this doesn't hit the mark. But I don't think DFH's intention was to hit the mark. I really wished the hops played a bigger role in this beer. It was just a little sweet. However, as the beer warmed, I found it to be more enjoyable. I think some aging would do wonders for this beer. I'd say it's worth a try if you can get your hands on some."

"O- Very good 'extreme' beer. More balanced with the malt qualities than I would have thought. Hops are still very much alive though, and I couldn't be happier. Definite sipper although it goes down fairly smooth. The only thing I can compare it to is a DFH 90 but 'bigger' all the way around. I'll be looking to age a few of this batch to see how she rounds out."

"Seems at its best warm, say 55 + degrees. Everything that this ale has comes out then, and that is quite a lot. A huge ale. ABV is 18% or better depending on the keg, and it is very noticeable. That being said it’s OK by me as I am a “big beer” fan."
""
""
""
"It pours a murky orange-brown, with a thin head that leaves a sticky lace down the glass (impressive for 20% ABV). The smell is powerful, with tons of dark fruits, huge amounts of toffee, caramel, and just a hint of sticky malt. The flavors are so complex, reminds me more of an American take on a Barleywine than a Double IPA. Lots of caramel and toffee, mixed with a sweet cherry and Tropical Fruit Palate. Also noted are molasses and dark fruit resins, a rush of hops balanced it out nicely. A slight burn on the back of the throat from the ABV. Surprisingly drinkable for such a large ABV. The mouthfeel is rich and sweet, with a highly complex palate... albeit a smooth, oily texture to make for a nice end of the night brew. Excellent and VERY tasty! Love it!"
""
""
""
"O - An extreme beer at 18% but more of a barley wine than an imperial IPA. It is priced at the top tier and it is very good, considering it should last you an hour.Note: This ruins all other beers."

""
""
""

""

"O - This is a good beer. Out of all dogfish head's beers I preferred this one, except for the chicory stout. This lives up to it's expectations."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange brown, moderate amounts of retention and lace. Nose has loads of hops and citrus notes, mild pineapple among other things. Herbal notes, that I'm sure come as a result of the sheer amount of hops here. Some fusel alcohol. Massive malt base - caramel and toffee, some toasty malt notes as well. Taste has lots of resinous hop flavours, lightly toasty malts and sugary caramel and toffee notes. Chewy and sticky feel, but not extremely heavy. Ethanol and heat in the finish, fairly bitter but not palate shredding. Super sweet and rich overall, a sample of this was adequate. I wasn't terribly blown away with this, but this was certainly an experience."
"Overall: It's an interesting beer. I like its taste, but at the same time I don't because this isn't what I feel a Double IPA should taste like. I miss the hoppiness. Where's the citrusy hops? I don't particularly like sweet IPA's, but I can't deny that this is still a good beer. Not my favorite Double IPA, yet I can't stop sipping it. I have another one that I'll age for at least a year, which is something I look forward to."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A little bit of a burn after it lands in the belly. Had this in 2008 and 2009...I think. This is not as syrupy as in the past. Love it! Hard to describe. Want more! Cannot imagine having two of these at one sitting. Best of the three years mentioned."
""
""
"If for no other reason, this should get a ridiculously high rating for it's hidden alcohol. I had DFH Fort which has a comparable ABV, and that one seemed like it could've been hooked up to a flame thrower. This, in contrast, drinks pretty friggin smooth. Nice coppery orange coloration with just a bit o' wisp for a head. Amongst the many citrus smells, I'm actually catching a bit of bubble gum. Taste is strong, but again, the abv is hidden pretty well. Nice crisp bite at the end. A surprising creaminess is there on the mouthfeel. Nice beer, but at $10 bucks for a single...."

"If there was a beer hall of fame, this should be in it."

"Smells coming from the bottle are deep caramel and molasses. Pours a dark brown with a one finger head that quickly recedes into a very patchy lace. Beer appears to be mildly carbonatedas there are some bubbles steadily rising to the surface of the glass. Beer has a very potent aroma of brown sugar that can be detected at quite a distance from the glass. Beer goes down smoothly for such a high abv. Slight alcohol burn followed by heavy sweetness and a touch of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is full but not as creamy as I had hoped, but seems to be appropiate for a sipping beer of this strength. Every sip of this beer I take I grow to like the beer more. At this age of a bottle it has matured into a lovely very large barleywine and is would sit well with those looking for a very sweet and balanced barleywine that hides it's abv very well. If I hadn't known it was 18% I would have guessed it to be around 12%. Have not had this beer fresh, but would imagine it to be an animal of a beer. Looking forward to getting a fresh bottle and doing a side-by-side tasting. Overall I feel this beer is a well put together barlewine/IIPA that does what it says on the side of the bottle, (ages well.) Would give it a 4.5 out of 5 and will purchase again."

"Pours a lovely golden color, see through and clear. No retention to speak of and the head dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is boozy which resides to the large sweet malty body. Aggressive hopping also allows a large pineyness and earthy/resinous dominance on the aroma. The taste is a balance of three extremes. Those of hops, alcohol, and sweetness. For me these three meet a middleground which I found very complex and satisfying. Alcohol on the palette is detectable but the sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness mingle and make it not hot. Huge pine resinous type flavor with a little citrus. Honey and caramel-like flavors balance with the huge over the top hoppiness. The beer is full bodied and a little syrupy. Carbonation is good. The mouthfeel does not get in the way of enjoying this beer, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Overall, I love this beer. The balance of the extremes is very impressive. This beer is not for everyone, but for hopheads with a sense of adventure you will love this."

"O: Loved this beer. very different from any other IIPA I've had. almost a class of its own, as the bitterness is much less, the hop flavor is much more present and not masked by bitterness, and of course that ever present sweetness."
"O: glad to have finally tried this, not really my thing, I'm all for ipas and high gravity brews, but this one goes into the range of being too much"
"Hazy dark orange/red body. Small amount of off white head that leaves only a few small puddles. Nose is resinous pine hops. Earthy, deep woods. Rich toasted caramel malts and a large overlay of Booze. Pungent. The first couple sips very surprisingly smooth. Creamy caramel, toasted Portuguese bread. Hops aren't overly bitter. A dark fruity character upfront and a pine sap finish. As it warms up the booze really starts to come through. The malt flavors start to become syrupy medicine halfway through the glass. I look forward to reviewing this batch again in a couple of years. I have confidence it will gain complexity and balance out."
"Worth trying on tap at least once but I don't know whether I'd seek this out in the bottle. The alcohol was noticeable but better masked than I had expected. The hops are big, but again, I wouldn't peg this at 120+ IBUs. Fun to try, though."
"Note: This ruins all other beers."
"Well, tried this side by side with an '09 of the same time frame. They both poured crystal clearly amber with a finger of off white foam which fell quickly to an extreme clarity. Old smelled sweet. New smelled vegetal. Old tasted sweet. New tasted sweet and astringent with a weird soured grape and acetone flavor. Both were appropriately carbed with a thin, syrupy feel. Both were a disappointment."
"Overall- Rich, big and bold. Oddly drinkable despite such massive characteristics. This beer is so humongous it's like an """IPA concentrate""" of sorts. All other IPAs are made from diluted Dogfish Head 120. A bit pricey, but certainly worth the try."
"O - Definitely an unusual IPA and fits more into wine category. I would recommend it."
"Medium bodied, kind of oily like cough syrup, but still smooth. Medium carbonation. Good stuff."
"O: I get it. The biggest, baddest, IPA on the block! But what I don't get is why people like this. There isn't much flavor to it, absolutely no subtlety, and a huge boozy rubbing alcohol punch in the finish. No thanks, the astringent quality of this beer ruins it for me. I just wouldn't look forward to trying another glass."
"O: Would love to try again, next time an aged bottle."
"Overall: An experience for sure, but not something I could ever finish by myself. Even with 4 of us, we couldn't finish the bottle."
"Its probably one of the most desireable brews around and routinely sells out. While at least $15 a bottle seems avg, its deff pricy but well worth to try every year. I have had this a few times but never reviewed it...I'd like to purchase again and re visit this next year. You don't need to read this to know you should try it."
"O: Overall this is a very interesting beer, and I am very glad that I got to try it. While it may not be the best beer int he world, it is certainly one of the more interesting, and intriguing. This is certainly a beer that pushing the borders of what beer is, and what it can evolve into."
"holy moly! this is the hophead mecca as far as i am concerned. pours a heady cloudy golden bronze color with what surely must be the thickest head in the history of beer. textured like a bouncyball! smell is elemental hops, resins, oils, saps, lupulin, all of it. there is a noticable alcohol smell as well, which of course there must be at 18%. the flavor is hectic, evacuating all other flavors from the mouth in favor of the hops in this beer, its got a slight bready thing going on, but its more like a hop loaf. a novel idea brilliantly executed, but this could never be anyone's daily drink. its just a huge huge beer. mouthfeel is sticky and chewy and bogged down by the absurd hopping. i like to have a couple of these every year, and i find the on tap version to be even more pronounced than the bottled version. another classic from dogfish head"
"Overall - it was quite enjoyable, I was happy splitting the bottle with someone, it was just enough. It sort of falls under the category of a hoppy barleywine in my mind. A nice boozy, hoppy kick in the mouth."
"Overall: This is a powerful beer - much closer to a fine whiskey than a beer. This one is defines what a """sipper""" is - no sane person would drink a whole bottle in an evening. Fantastic!"
"Intense! That best describes this beer. Draft poured in a small snifter. Darker yellow with a nice inch of fairly dense foam. My color could be off a bit, the bar was dark. The smell is great. Like sticking your face in a bushel of hops. At first the taste is a little much. Extreme sweet hops with alcohol. Once your taste buds recover the sweet, juciy hoppiness takes the stage with some oak and citrus making an appearance. Mouthfeel is medium, not as heavy as you'd expect from something this big. Overall an enjoyable experience. Defiantly a one beer show. Not only due to the ABV by your taste buds are a little worn out when finished. Interesting ans unique beer. Highly recommended."
"Overall - I have been seeking this beer for years now but not enough to pay crazy prices for it. I walked into my local beer shop tonight and out of nowhere there were 3 bottles of this and i couldn't believe it, its not the type of store that would have it. It was also fresh i should mention. I bought three bottles in giddiness because DFH was the beer that got me into craft brews and ever since i have been looking for this. Well, 3 years down the line and with complete palate change i am still pretty impressed with this. Is it very sweet and malty? yes. Is it a hop heads dream? absolutely not. Is it a very good beer? in my opinion YES. i am very happy with this one."
"O - a lil overhyped for the taste. Solid, just not the best beer. Enjoyable, wont put it on my wants list, but will take it if I have the opportunity."
"EDIT (4-21-2012): Wiseman Justin reflects upon this beer and grossly disagree's with Wiseman Nick. Any number of variables could have polluted Wiseman Nick's 120 minute and therefore both Wisemen would and could be right without having to resort to """non-Wiseman""" behavior (such as name calling). See you in 9 months friend."
"I really don't know where to put this one. Definately complex and great but not really a daily drinker. I get why it is so famous but not sure I would have more than one of these a year at the most. This is not an imperial IPA, Ive had plenty of those and can not really compare those to this. So hard to rate."
"O: Strong alcohol presence overshadows IPA characteristics. Definitely worth having, but only one at a time for sure."
"The beer is an interesting experiment, but seems wildly off balance. The alcohol level seems forced and while a boat load of hops were used, they don't pair with the malt profile in a way that pleases this palate. Well, not for me, leaves more for the rest of you..."
"Overall I am a little disappointed with my first 120 experience. I would like to get a hold of a few more bottles for cellaring purposes. In the end i still take my hat off to the dogfish head brewery and commend them for their courageous exploration in the world of craft brewing."
"If this batch has been brewed consistently the same with no change to the recipe, then I can safely say: it take 8 years [minimum] for this beer to evolve to its perfect state."
"D/O: A fun, enjoyable beer that I would certainly repeat if I found it again. However, if for no other reason than for the sake of my sobriety, I'd probably not opt to have two back-to-back. An interesting brew from Dogfish, for sure."
"O- This is a pretty good novelty beer and something that I would only suggest to experienced drinkers of imperial craft brews. Not a practical every day beer. Im not a huge fan of these types of IPAs, as I gravitate toward the crisp West Coast style IPAs. However, considering its 18% ABV, its crafted pretty well. Very pricey though, only by a single. A case will likely run you over $100. I wouldnt suggest drinking any more than one of these at a time."
"Overall - nice slow sipper with age. I am good for one, once a year."
"Cheers!"
"Over all I can not wait for 10-24-12 so that we can have this once a year experience and will do so for the next 3 years."
"I'll pick 69/90 miniute IPA over this anytime."
"O= Overall, I remember not really enjoying it when I had it but now after I've been trying different styles for over a year now. I want to revisit this one again. Not really trying to seek it out that hard but if I stumble across a bottle again I will pick it up again just to see if I can appreciate it a little more my second time around."
"Cheers!"
"The label says this beer ages well; I'd be interested to see what a couple years does to this beast, but I'm really enjoying the fresh hop flavors."
"overall: Good, nothing I would seek out."
"This beer is overpoweringly sweet and way too hot. Got a bit better as it warmed and will be drinkable with age on it. Fresh though I'll pass. It took me 2 hours to polish this off and don't see myself craving another anytime soon."
"O: The availability and $10 price tag of this beer makes the drinkability very low making it a one at a time deal. However, this is a great beer. One of my favorites since it was one of the first craft beers I had when I started drinking decent brews. Although very sweet and syrupy for the style, DFH did a solid job with this one. If you have an extra one, definitely do a Heaven & Hell black and tan."
"When I drink one of these its usually split between two people. Its an interesting beer to sip on but I wouldn't want to drink 12oz by myself."
"Let me bask in this. Let me drown."
"O: What I expected for the most part. Obviously a sipper, and it has some very nice flavors asides from just booze. Probably the only beer I've had with over 100 IBU's that I wouldn't say is bitter. Gotta love extreme beers!"
"Bottle poured into a Chimay Goblet. The beer pours a copper color with a quickly dispersing head. Beer is slightly cloudy but enough only to barely notice. I am surprised honestly at how bitter this beer is but with only how lightly the scent of hops emanates from it. If I had smelled this not knowing what it was, it could be a normal pale ale. Taking a sip however immediately changes your taste buds. There is a lot of malt, backed by a generous hop flavors, and a sweet finish. This is a completely different style of DIPA from say a Stone Ruination. I would say there is almost an element of a Barleywine in this brew. The ABV of 18% is not too severe on the palate, and this bottle is a 2011 release. The beer gets more fragrant, complex, and flavorful as the beer warms into the low 60 degree F range. It will warm on you too, as the abv and the sheer style of the beer makes this a sipper, rather than a session beer. I had to keep readjusting the smell score as it kept changing as the beer warmed. My final thoughts: I like this beer, is it something I would pay to have on a regular basis? No, not even if I could, as in CT this is rather a PITA to find. But it is an enjoyable treat that is definitely different than many of the throw as many hops in as possible style DIPA's."
"O – Alcohol was overpowering for me. A decent beer but far from my favorite DIPA."
"O/D - Odd. A very boozy, sweet, and hoppy beer. Probably needs more hops. An extreme beer in every sense of the term. Nice. I was happy to try it but didn't exactly enjoy it as a DIPA. Extremely drinkable and smooth. A solid beer, but too boozy for me."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled In Date of 2011 106 3. Pours a murky dark brownish amber color with a thin head. Good amountbalance of lacing.Aroma is very boozy with some dark fruits and citrus hops. The taste is a big amount of hops and booze. Dark fruits as well as a similar taste to WWS and Olde School. More reminiscent of Olde School than WWS. Not alot of carbonation. Boozey and somewhat bitter near the end with a bit of a raisins. This is the freshest I have had this and I thought the aged ones tasted like someone dropped a shot of vodka into a 90min. Fresh, however, this beer has more of a different taste to it. Almost like a boozier, hoppier version of Olde School, but not as good. Overall, pricey for what it is, but worth having every so often."
"There are so many dimensions to this beer, you really have to be able to sit with this, sip it and let it warm to appreciate how much depth of flavor this has. It's certainly is going to be a polarizing beer due to its aggressive nature, but well crafted this one is. Nicely done, I'm stocking up on some to age."
"I like this one more than the sum of its parts. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one a night, but it would be a very enjoyable night."
"Cheers"
"O - I have been waiting to get my hands on this beer for a while now. It has lived up to expectations. While it isn't the best example of an IPA I have had, it does an amazing job to balance itself and the alcohol for the ABV it contains."
"M- The hoppy bitterness of this beer is downplayed by the sweetness which almost makes you pucker up when taking your first sip. There is a sharp alcoholic sensation in the front and back of each sip as it travels through your mouth and down your throat."
"Overall surprisingly impressive. Not that hoppy really but also not as sweet as I remember it. The salted caramel angle is real nice and I certainly don't remember that at all. And for a whopping eighteen abv, I honestly could hardly tell. I've had 13-11-10 percent barleywines that just flat out knocked me out, this... like drinking a charm. Fantastic. Perhaps a re-review of the bottle should be in the cards."
"O: A fun experiment for sure. Good dessert beer, it is as sweet as a huge imperial stout. It hits hard for sure, sip on this bad boy! Deceptive alcohol despite the huge ABV."
"Half bottle served into a lowball. Split the bottle with a buddy. Man, this most certainly must be an acquired taste. Pours a translucent gold with a thin head. This smells more like hard liquor than beer. The booze is so forward. It comes off more as brandy than beer. I don't smell hops at all. The taste is ultra sweet. Again, very boozy. This is like...a liqueur. The mouthfeel is very syrupy. This is thick as sin. Again, it's more like a cordial. Ironically, this has more burn to it than liquors of the same ABV. Craziness. I simply do NOT realize what the big deal is over this beer. I won't be seeking this out again."
"Very highly recommended."
"D: Definitely a once-in-a-while sipping beer. Enjoy this beer responsibly, as it will sneak up on you."
"o) overall, just a sweet, sugary beer. Brings under attenuation to a whole new level for me."
"120 is an interesting beer, but it is just too boozy for me. I have tried it quite a few times now, and I just cannot seem to get past all of the alcohol. With that said, I think I prefer not enjoying this beer on-tap, as I enjoy it even less out of the bottle."
"The 2011 I found to be much sweeter, yet much easier to drink. The 2008 was REALLY overwhelmingly hoppy; like it almost hurt on the first sip. Obviously the 2011 is hoppy enough that my taste buds are a bit destroyed for the next beer or two, but it was definitely easier to put down. I wish I could have bought another bottle to age and smooth it out. All in all this beer is more of an experience than it is a top 5 kind of thing."
"It's like the port wine of beers. Very desserty."
"Very intense beer, no surprise at 18%. An opaque/copper color with orange hue. Small, off-white head. Really sweet malt and honey smell with orange and floral mixed in. Definitely can smell the alcohol. Very sweet taste and thick mouthfeel with almost no carbonation. Alcoholic taste is strong at end but still drinkable. Lots of stuff going on in taste. Hop taste is dry and not bitter. Definitely a sippin beer, took us quite awhile to finish and nothing can follow this."
"What do I have to say about this big beer after all is said and done? I like it a lot. More than I thought I would. On the sweet side but better balance than you'd expect. I'd like to try and age some of these but I doubt they'll last that long. Also another plus about this beer is it's a quick and easy buzz in a bottle. I tried to identify more flavors half way through the bottle but i'm afraid my tastebuds already took the day off! enjoy!"
"This batch failed to be hoppy to me. I had a nice 2010 hoppy sample. HUGE beer that doesn't being hops this time. Too hot and sweet."
"Good to try once or twice a year, but this is really quite sweet. I don't really dig hoppy dessert beers. The alcohol is smooth and not to be feared, but the malty sweetness is just overbearing. The flavor needs to be worked on hard. In that regard, sometimes less is more. This is toooo over the top. Probably finishes close to 1.040 FG."
"Glad I got to try it, but I'm moving on. It was funny to see everyone at Toronado drinking the same thing."
"Purchased in October of 2011 and had just been delivered the second weekend of the month. Pours a Golden-Amber color and looks very clear with not head. Continued to bubble for a good ten minutes despite that fact that it was poured in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with no rough marks or chips to induce bubbling. First taste is a strong IPA, not my favorite style in general but it’s very hoppy and has a nice bitter taste to it. Defiantly some pine flavors and I can smell and taste the hops. Then the alcohol hits and burns the back of my mouth. While I’m glad I got to try this one, between the lasting alcohol flavor that lingers far longer than the actual IPA taste, and the price tag of 9.99 or so, it’s not something I would drink a lot or buy except to try maybe once a year if that."
"Overall: This is extreme beer. It is good but must be prepared for. When finished, where does one go? Wherever that is, you will find me there."
"Best way to describe this beer is the ultimate hop syrup. The mouth feel is maple syrup. Color is brown. Smell is floral with sweet malt undertones. Not as great a smell as the 90 minute. Palate is sweet yet hoppy. For the 20%, drink it slow. For the $20, drink it sparingly. A crazy IPA meant to be drank only on occasions."
"The first of a couple surprise bottles cracked at the latest Bliss tasting. It pours a slightly murky orange-straw-amber topped by a finger of bright cream foam. The nose comprises heavy pine resin, mentholated honeydew, rich caramel, and a hardy backbone of alcohol. The taste brings in much of the same, with everything taken to the nth degree. Honestly, it's all a bit much when put together like this. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy, syrupy feel. Overall, what could have been a decent DIPA is hindered by what I can only call too much girth and presence. There's just too much of everything here for anything good to come of it."
"Update: After trying this from a flute 8oz serving and sipping instead of going all out in a pint (thought this would be a Semi Strong IPA) I actually liked this brew. I still would go beyond a smaller serving but this isn't as bad as I thought."
"Overall: I'm a little disappointed, I love this beer aged a few years it reminds me of a big barleywine, but I was expecting a hop bomb.... not so much."
"O- I'm glad to have had the opportunity to snag a few of these just to see what the fuss was about, but I don't think this was the beer for me. A very interesting piece of work to sip on, but the flavors here were just too out of balance and overpoweringly sweet to be able to enjoy any more than 6oz or so of this at a time. I understand how difficult it must be to tame a beast of this high alcohol content while juggling the unusual technique of 120 minutes of hopping during a boil, but the impressiveness of the feat doesn't quite make up for the lack of finesse that the brew carries."
"Bottle to oversized tulip. Appearance is great; thick and burnt-orange in appearance. Smells excellent. A good prep for what's to come. Taste is BITTER - and bitter is better. Mouthfeel is good too - for a beer that's 18%. Overall, a very good sipper. People who complain about this beer should realize what they're walking into before they buy it. It's not your mother's IPA."
"I understand why this beer is brewed and why some might enjoy it, but I definitely did not. Found it to be virtually undrinkable."
"Age it or not, this beer is one in a million. Odd how the nose doesn't stand out...but it absolutely melts in your mouth. World class - and another pioneering brew from Sam and the good folks at DFH."
"This is my first time having fresh 120 minute, and it'll be my last. I think it's AMAZING with 2-3 years on it... But difficult to drink fresh.  Absolutely a sipper."
"O - The 120 Minute is a special and unique beer. It really tastes like an IPA/Barleywine hybrid. The extreme ABV is something to watch out for and causes a bit of boozy heat, but this beer still has great flavor and lives up to the hype. I would definitely have it again!"
"Lived under expectations.. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but this turned out to be an average beer at best. Perhaps I sat on it too long?"
"O: I'm not sure if this has gotten better my tastes have just changed, but this is a bit better than I remember it to be. However, I still don't think it's worth $10 per 12 oz. bottle."
"O - very good tasting. Very powerful. Glad I got it on tap"
"This batch of 120 Minute is the first released since Dogfish famously dumped an obscene number of gallons of the previous lot and tweaked the recipe. The adjustments paid off; this is way more drinkable and balanced than any previous iteration I’ve tried."
"The taste starts malt with an earthy bitter. The hops and alcohol come in and create a numbing feel mixed in as the carbonation subsides nice"
"M: Very thin mouthfeel due to the high alcohol content and low carbonation. A small sip went a long way to coat all of your taste buds."
"I had high expectations, and while this isn't by any means bad, I just feel like I don't get it. I'd rather have one out of their regular lineup."
"Overall Drinkability - Insane complexity and a lack of off-flavors make this what I consider a perfect beer."
"Overall: I opened this brew in celebration of my second Daughter Ella Monika! This brew was actually sweet which I was not expecting but loved. A very hyped and brew which went above and beyond my expectations. It's a celebration! Cheers!"
"Overall - Not at all a hop-lovers dream. The sweet, syrup-like consistency makes this much like a dessert beer. Meant to be sipped and shared. Glad I tried it, but not at all what I was looking forward to."
"While many others said it was just too sweet and overpowering, I happened to really enjoy it. Yes, it's intense but it's meant to be sipped. It was a treat. Plenty of sugar and hops blend very nicely for a smooth finish for such a huge beer."
"Very good.. Much better at room temp. I am speechless. Hop liquor... hop syrup... umm...Cheers Sam."
"Drink- Hot damn, this was really good for what it still is. It wasn't super hoppy but just a thicker, malty strong beer."
"O: This is the second time I've tried this beer, and both times (2 year old batch and 6 month old batch) have had almost no hop presence whatsoever. If this is what they consider their holy grail for hopheads, then they have seriously failed. It says it ages well, but I wouldn't recommend drinking one past 4 months old unless you wanna drink straight malt syrup, which is what it tasted like to me both times. Very disappointing, as I was expecting a ridiculously hoppy brew to satiate my hop withdrawals, but this has failed to deliver both as a fresh bottle and as an aged one."
"O - awesome this beer is really too drinkable for its abv"
"Tried a Dogfish Head 120 appx 2 years ago from a bottle this time from tap at Engine 15 in Jax Beach. There is a big difference in my two experiences. Much smoother taste and smell than from the bottle, nice small head with very fine Belgian lace, great color, and very drinkable."
"Now this beer does have its place. It's more of a liquor than a beer. At 18%abv it's something to be sipped. I actually prefer 6-8 ounces at a time as an after dinner beer. I have to say while it's hop infusion to the extreme, it's not as bitter as even some of the double ipas out there. It does have a reasonable balance."
"This beer is often seen as a gimmick and I thought this about the beer to a degree in the past. This version is simply not what I've had before or age does this beer terrible injustices. If you like a THICK malty double IPA or you want an english barely wine malt profile with american hops give this beer a try. A truly amazing effort that justifies the two dumped out batches. This review shouldn't go along side the older versions as this is simply a new beer!"
"Notes: On tap at Beer Revolution. Not sure the year. It was surprisingly not too boozy. Having had 90 Minute, I knew this would be sweet and it definitely was. Nice beer with plenty of sweet hopiness, but there is a touch of bitterness. Good, but I don't know if I'd pay the price for a bottle."
"Overall I'm quite pleased with this, is it worth the price, yes at $10, not at 18$ where I've seen it at other stores. Thank you Ian for this bottle. This bottle can easily be shared with a few friends. I was not blown away with this but none the less very pleased with it. I'd consider cellaring a few of these for future tastings."
"10/5/09 bottling date. Pours a light red amber, with burnt orange hues with the faintest trace of a foam cap leaving thin lacing. Barely any carbonation that works well with this beer. The nose hints you with warm port/sherry booze right off the bat. Baking spices along with spiced apple pastry, rich oloroso sherry, currant and booze soaked raisins and a touch of figs as well. Very nice complex nose definitely more fortified wine than beer. The taste brings sweet barleywine like malts with enough alcohol to wash it away - i might be able to tell the abv is this high but it is so well balanced it never comes across as hot. Hops really arent perceptible at this age, there is almost some caramel as well as light red fruit and raisins. Extremely drinkable and a rare treat in CA, would love to try this fresh."
"O: Liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, and glad I shared it; 6oz is plenty. A really well crafted ale, but definitely a sipper."
"D: 1 sip was enough ... in a lifetime of sipping ... i'm not sure I could have made it through my 3oz pour."
"Dogfish heads 120 minute is, like all of their IPA's nicely crafted and very flavorful. When poured it has a opaque golden color with a thick creamy and persistent head. The flavor is a blend of pine, hops, and citrus, there is a boozy undertone but thats to be expected with a dipa. The mouth feel is creamy and thick. Overall its a solid beer, not the best this brewer has to offer but a great IPA none the less."
"Overall, it's a great desert beer"
"Regardless of the style categorization definitely an experience, I prefer some other DIPAs to this one but definitely worth trying at lease once."
"Overall is ok but I probably should have aged this for a while. I think all the hype this year compelled me to go ahead and try it. This is my second attempt at drinking this beer and trying to enjoy it. This time didn't go much better than the first."
"I had heard so much about this beer prior to trying that I had figured it to be very alcohol tasting, with the high percentage. I was suprised that is was defintely drinkable although one was enough to provide a good feeling. The beer didnt smell 18% at all (thinking maybe liquor type smell) but it didnt smell that interesting either. The taste proved to be exceptional very powerful and lasted flavor in my mouth considerably longer than other beers that I have drank. It wasnt all the hype I expected but it did taste good. If I can sit down and drink this no problem with it being 18% I am happy."
"O: A great beer to try. Not only is a great tasting, but it a great conversation piece to sit and share with a friend."
"Not like anything I've ever tried before...not detestable, but just kind of bizarrely intense. I'd try it again, but definitely only sips of it."
"Overall: Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA is a truly unique beer. Often labelled a """sipper", I found it difficult to put my glass down. A must try for anyone that considers themselves a hop-head."
"Overall: This is the kind of power I look for in a DIPA. Delicious as well. I can see why some people will age this like a barleywine, but I will drink it fresh."
"O: My face was incredibly warm after drinking this, which is probably the most positive thing I have to say about the beer. There are flourishes of greatness hiding, but the alcohol really overpowers everything that is going on here. This is one whale that's not worth the effort to capture. I'm sure glad I didn't have to jump through any hoops to get my bottle other than walking into Whole Foods and finding it on the shelf. It's worth trying with a group of friends, but I feel that there is too much hype surrounding this at the moment. I can safely say that I never want to drink this ever again."
"Overall: It was a sweet, big beer that took a bit of time to drink 6 oz. As the beer warmed it reminded of a port wine, complex flavors, hoppy but with a honey, malt flavor and citrus on the back end. This is a beer I could drink every so often, a couple of year would be fine for me. I'll try aging a bottle and see how the flavors mellow."
"This is an exceptional beer, perhaps the best I have ever had. For a flavor-intense style, nothing matches it."
"Very pleasently surprised by this one. Sweet, but balanced."
"I was lucky to have it in a growler from the brewery and brought up to Philly for Philly Beer Week at $5 a glass (such a good price I had 2!), but I can't seem to get a hand on it anywhere else."
"I have 3 bottles left, and I am definitely going to age them and save them for a special occasion(s). I'm assuming the sweetness will balance out."
"My first and only time trying the highly anticipated 120 and a dense and cloudy peach orange nectar color filled the glass with little to no head. A vast aroma of caramel, deep roasted sugar and fruit fills the nose. On the palate, a solid earthy sweet peach and orange nectar citrus taste invades the palate with a remarkably smooth and deceptive abv. Alcohol is instantly warming. Dry and sticky herbal exotic fruit sweetness in the finish leaves you wanting a next sip...Five 8 oz. servings after my first sip, I left the bar realizing that I had just had my ass whooped by the smoothest, suavest, nuclear hop bomb of my beer drinking life..."
"absolutely an ender. if you could go there you can't return. i've had it before on an really hot day and had to share. the older the better. when young has a wafer yeasty quality in the malt. the older ones have a culmination of flavors. smells of rhubarb. and the palate is mildly citrus like a english barley. this is a barley most definitely. i would like to try it as fresh as it comes. has a long flavor that is suprisingly not as deep as i would have expected. quite drinkable when aged. smooth, caramel nougat, under ripen apple pie. a bit sour... a bit dense sugar laden. nicely carbonated."
"Overall, I’m very pleased I was able to this guy fresh, and forever grateful I was given a few extra to stock away for resampling down the road. Thanks again Bill, you’re awesome!"
"All around, a great beer. Well made and with purpose. Could do with some age but fresh it is still amazing."
"Well I had this beer on tap at the hipness throw down and I can honestly say I don't plan on trying it again. To start off I am not sure of the vintage. This beer poured an orange with a reddish tinge. The beer is visibly thick and had a small off white head a veery small head. The smell was dominated by sweetness that I knew was not going to make th beer taste good. There was also a hop presence but I took a back seat to the sweetbread and huge alcohol presence. The flavor follows the taste to a tee. Huge sweetness wiu minimal hops followed by a donkey punch of alcohol burning. The mouthfeel is so out of wack for an ipa it's more like q barley wine. Overall I would say if you want to try the beer buy one and try it but don't have high hopes. Avoid"
"To me this tastes/feels more like a dessert wine or liqueur than a beer. For what it is I actually kind of like it, but I wouldn't want to drink it very often even if I could. Still, this is a unique beer and I'm not surprised that Dogfish Head is behind it."
"Very sweet i get candied sugar right away super sweet and bitter very very nice!"
"O - I have had this stuff fresh, aged for a few years, and now aged for the maximum amount of time, and every time I leave it feeling let down. If you like over the top sweetness, this is your beer. If you like balance of flavors, avoid it at all costs."
"O: Needless to say, this thing is just too intense on the sweetness. I absolutely can't believe that some like this fresh. This kills the palate with some thick sugar crystals and bigger alcohols. Sweet potato fermented vodkas find an evil twin in tamarind infused tequilas. I can't even finish my overall review... passing...out...2....sweet.."
"O: Expectations were high, and they were met, and possibly exceeded. I tried to temper the expectations, but 2 years of waiting on this one will really whet your palate. It really really is a well constructed beer, DFH has done it again."
"All in all, this is an extremely well balanced and intense beer. I would love to have it again if it weren't sold out!"
"Overall: I recommend trying this but I really don't think this is worth buying. Again totally let down by yet another dogfish beer."
"Coppery amber pour with a thin but sticky white head. This is an big, big beer. Extremely pungent citrus hop aroma, complemented by hints of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, and vanilla. Taste is very sweet up front, probably less sweet than you might imagine. All the flavors you might expect in your favorite barleywine. The candyish sweetness is very nicely offset by the ridiculous accompanying hop flavor and bitterness."
"A final note for those interested (including dieters): according to the Dogfish Head website, this weighs in at a hefty 450 calories per 12 oz serving."
"O: Thought this was great. Better than WWS, not on the level of 120. 4.5"
"O: This was a drain pour for me, I couldn't get past 3 sips. Sickly sweet doesn't even come close, it's disgusting. I don't even know how someone calls this a DIPA. Think of the thickest, sweetest, hottest American Barleywine imaginable, it doesn't have anything on 120min IPA. I can't say this word enough: Disgusting. The only reason this doesn't get a complete fail is because it wasn't a stomach churning, make me puke nasty, just way way way too sweet."
"O: Clearly this beer is meant as a treat. No one sessions this! That said, it's pretty well balanced and way better than previous vintages have been fresh. I've got another that I plan on hanging on to for a year or so, so we'll see how that goes."
"Plus, it really does taste pretty good. I'm impressed."
"The beer reminds me a lot of Paulo Santo Marron, with much of the flavor coming from the alcohol. It wasn't as hoppy as I would've expected or liked, but it is what it is. A rare beer, but nothing exceptionally special."
"Worthy! Oh so Worthy!"
"O - Overall great brew. Hard to explain the 18%, but i guess its there. I am usually thinking of piny/grassy/floral hops flavor but this was different for a IPA of this kind. It came undone after it warmed up a little and I kinda liked it better when warmer. On a limited tap at Urge San Diego... and i took home the dogfish head super cool glasses!"
"O - WTF was that? I glad I bought 2 bottles, curious to see how it ages."
"That being said, thanks and kudos to Dogfish for continuing to make beers nobody else in the world would even dream of making."
"O: glad I got to experience this and want to age some to see how the flavor will develop. Definitely impressed with the high abv and still being able to maintain good flavors! Thank you DFH!"
"o - Overall a pretty good beer, but I was a bit disappointed. It is very strong and very very sweet, and does not have a ton of fresh hops going on with it, more fruity malts. While I enjoyed it, a 10 oz. pour was way too much. They offered 4 oz. samples of the beer which sounds about perfect to me; halfway through the glass it got kind of rough. I'd have it again, but would want to keep it to the 2 or 4 oz. pours. Pretty good, just not what I look for in a DIPA."
"Overall I must let you all know how great this is! I haven't had this for probably four years or so, but I don't think my palate was quite as refined as it is now. A must try.... every year. This was the 2011 vintage. Thanks to Jonathan for this sample."
"Ok for all intents and purposes, this is not a realistic beer to drink very often, but you have to appreciate the uniqueness and out of the box thinking that DFH is known for. I will be sure to try to pick up one from the next batch as I am extremely interested in how they compare. I have no doubt that the newer one will not be so smooth or port like. Thank you DFH!"
"I got this as an extra from roguegregm in a trade. Many thanks to him for the generosity."
"For the amount of hops, an oddly smooth finish. The hops are super tasty, they don't ruin the palate like with a Stone Ruination IPA. You can really taste the distinctiveness of the hop flowers."
"Also had the '05 bottle side by side. It's much smoother, with a strong oaky flavor, and settled hops."
"-Cheers"
"O: The beer is intense!"
"Mouthfeel is very creamy. Drinkability is not really there. Its a great beer to try for sure especially since its super hard to find outside of Delaware."
"If you've ever had 90 minute, this really is a VERY over the top exaggeration of that. Very heavy-bodied, nice creamy thick head, beautiful dark amber color with a sleight haze. This brew is way too sweet to be anything but an extremely high gravity, fruity-hoppy novelty you'll want to drink once annually, just to see if your initial reaction was consistent with your current one. Disappointing in the drinkability department, with a great hop profile. A real mixed bag to enjoy on the rare ocassions when it's available."
"Here’s to one hundred more!"
"O - I expected just a big hop punch which I got, but didn't expect that smooth silky backbone that made this very enjoyable to drink. I could see where aging would be interesting, but I prefer just that massive hop character. I would for sure seek this out again fresh."
"O: Very good beer. I can't rate it too highly as an IPA or Double IPA or anything as it was really something unique. Certainly worth the adventure to get it. Highly recommend everyone check this out as it really is something else."
"O - Wow! What a differeny beer. I've come to find that any beer that's this strong is very sweet, and this one is no exception. But even tho it's strong and sweet, the hops really try to shine thru on this one. Really great beer, but not """the holy grail for hopheads""" as it proclaims."
"Overall - Overall, I loved this beer. I was expecting a burning sensation like vodka and an overhopped unnecessarily bitter beer, but instead this beer is reminiscent of barleywine and very well balanced."
"100th review!"
"D- very hot and overly sweet low drinkability."
"This is my first review on BA, ever. I felt compelled to post about this, as it is probably the best beer I've had all year (beats out Nugget Nectar on Tap, which was also amazing). I had this on tap at Sunset in Allston, in a 10 oz glass. It's 18+% ABV, but couldn't taste it. Smells of grapefruit, aftertaste of something that I can quite put my finger on (ginger, maybe?). So good, had to to have a second glass, despite the price."
"So....where are the hops? I actually don't mind the sweetness, but by the end of the drink, it just starts to become too much. And I only had 6 ounces of it. I was a little let down, and I'd be really interested to see what age does to this."
"Reviewed from notes. Tasted on July 13th. Poured an '09 bottle into taster glass. Pours a hazy amber with no head at all, even with the aggressive pour. In my nose I find a bit of orange and grapefruit, lots of alcohol. . . LOTS, bread, small amount of hops. On the tongue the alcohol is a little less, but I was definitely overwhelmed by the warmth of it. Lots of caramel and malt with a small bit of citrus hops, but barely. Goes down the gullet with the burn, lack of carbonation brings that forth. I would much like to try it fresh. I will definitely acquire again. I hope for it to be more hoppy/citrus."
"O - I'll start by saying I'm glad I got to try this...I've always heard mixed feelings about this beer and now I can have my own opinion...I knew this was going to be a big beer...and it was...I feel the flavor of the hops got lost...there is too much honey/caramel flavors going on that it hides the hops...the alcohol presence is also big in this beer and it provides that warming sensation...I ordered this as my last beer knowing it would be big and it took me awhile to sip on it...I think I'll stick to the 60 or 90 Minute versions (75 when I'm back in Rehoboth!)"
"O - I guess I was expecting more of a super-duper IIPA and thats not what it is, its really sweet where I was looking for really bitter, its not a bad brew and its very interesting, I'm not looking for another though, at least not for a while..."
"O - This is a fantastic beer. Well worth the price and the wait. As far as what everyone says..."""it does not at all resemble 60 or 90 minute"""...pretty true. Surprsingly this beer is much less hop-forward than even the 60 minute, never mind the 90 minute, and it is also much sweeter and has way more of a noticeable alcohol character. I have also heard about as many positive reviews as I have negative. I have a feeling that many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that most expect it to be a hop-bomb that completely blows away 90 minute ipa...this is far from the case, but it is definitely a great beer that it worthy of the hype...I just wish it was easier to access. If I had to compare this to another beer in terms of similarities...none really come to mind, but this beer is more similar to a Belgian Tripel or even a Barleywine (sweeter styles)...definitely not comparable to any other DIPAs. This beer is closer to mead than a DIPA in my opinion."
"O-Been waiting for this beer for over a year and it did not dissapoint. Definately one of the more interesting beers DFH or anyone for that matter puts out. I actually ordered a variety 5 beer DFH flight while i sipped it so i could savor it longer. I have a bottle of it also which i think I will age, but definately happy to have had it fresh on tap at the Brewpub."
"I averaged together the two scores to achieve my actual rating."
"Overall, this was unlike nearly every other beer I’ve ever had. High alcohol but drinkable... Be careful."
"O- Interesting beer, I’ve been wanting to try this for a while and Im glad to have tried it, would love to try this one fresh to compare, really surprised by how easy drinking this is. I actually enjoyed it somewhat."
"O- I've been drinking one 12 oz for about...two hours now. Still not done. This is such an absolute sipper that it's a turnoff. Even three years of age didn't kill the booze"
"Although I will never adjust an overall score based on price, I will through this out there that at 10 bucks for a 10oz this is one of the worse Rating/Price beers out there. Black Ops is expensive but great, GI Rare was EXPENSIVE but a top beer in my book."
"Overall - This one's fresh and I have one to age. We'll see how it develops, but I'm not in a rush to drink any more of these fresh."
"Vry interesting..."
"O (D) - It's hot. It's big. A crazy beer that could still use more time. But I like it."
"A great brew, if you are lucky enough to find one. Bravo DFH!!"
"O- I am truly surprised how good this is fresh, I really thought it would be too boozy and a little bit of a mess. I have had it before with some age on it, and it is great aged. I am really glad that I was able to get ahold of a few bottles. I can't wait to have this again with some age on it."
"O--I'm glad I got the chance to try this. Since I have gotten into craft, this beer has not been available. Luckily, I snagged the last bottle of this before it was gone. Not something I will actively seek out and drop all the money on in the future--especially since DFH makes a lot more wallet-friendly, wonderful tasting IPAs."
":-) Thanks Bocktown beer and grill for having this one."
"O: More please. Alongside DFH's Olde School Barleywine, this is one great beer. Something to have on a special occasion or for during a equally great dinner."
"I can't deny this. It's my #1 and I'd cross the dessert for it. It's amazing and my heart grew fonder due to not having one for about 18 months. All hail 120!!!"
"Fun story: I went to the Dogfish Head Alehouse for my birthday, and halfway through my dinner they tapped a new keg of this. People actually cheered."
"This is an experience... and I reserve the right to re-review it on the next bottle."
"O: I really thought this beer was going to be too much. It was a surprise that it drank so well. The sweetness was a little overwhelming for us both but I can see past that to all the good this has to offer. I'm very interested to try this both fresh and much older now to see the drastic changes it can go through. This is a must-try."
"D – At $8.50 retail per 12-oz bottle, this is not a session beer. And even if it were less expensive, between the high ABV and the general heaviness of the beer, it would be tough to drink more than 2, 3 max, in a sitting"
"O - Strong, warming, sipper, great vintage!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is far from your standard Double IPA, but that shouldn't be a deterrent. Dogfish Head is known for pushing boundaries and this one definitely meets that objective. I plan on aging the other bottle for a while. I recommend picking up at least one bottle if you've never tried it before."
"O: Found it to be a wonderful interpretation, alcohol was not nearly as perceptive as I have seen in others with similar ABV, really loved the hopiness and how it wasn't pushed aside by the alcohol"
"D: Couldn't drink more than one in an evening. One that really should be savored and allowed to open to fully enjoy. I can really only recommend this to those looking for something completely unique or those that are die hard DFH fans. It will be interesting to see how this beer develops over time as Sam works on reigning this beast of a brew in."
" I don't really like sweet beer. This one goes way beyond Belgian sweetness. This is supposed to be a fantastic beer but I cut it to 3.0 overall. It's ok with food but tough to drink by itself."
"EDIT: Tried an '08 at DFH Brewing and Eats in Rehoboth Beach in Dec 2011. It was astringent, slightly herbal with hops that give way to honey, but not particularly sweet. Nose had mostly ethanol."
"Overall somewhat different than I expected. Very sweet. It's good but not one of my favorites. Like a super malted 90 minute."
"D - A novelty I suppose, but to me it seems like a waste of a lot of good hops. I guess it is one of those beers that everyone wants to try at least once, but I doubt I'll be drinking another anytime soon."
"QUITE GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"O - Overall, I was kinda disappointed with this beer. For all the hype that surrounds it I guess I was expecting a hell of alot more. I have 3 more bottles and look forward to seeing what happens over time with them all."
"Overall this is a beer for the hop heads of course. I'm glad that I was able to try it but I would't kill for another really. It smells amazing and the finish is great but the sweetness is just wooo"
"I can enjoy this, but I probably wouldn't just buy one any time. It reminds me too much of gin & tonic, which I can get much cheaper. Still, I'm glad I had the opportunity, and I may pick up another bottle, since I'm interested to see how well this ages."
"O- Fresh, this is a very good beer. Hoppy and balanced out by the sweetness (maybe even too much). Can't wait to see what it's like in a few years."
"interesting, but not sure I'd visit again."
"O: I was hoping for the holy grail for hopheads, but instead I get a barleywine that's been fortified with syrup and booze for 120 minutes. I'm sorry, but this is probably one of the worst beers I've had to drink, and I love other DFH stuff like 90 minute, WWS, Chateau Jiahu and others...but this just blows. Now I'm stuck with 5 bottles of this stuff. Anyone wanna trade?"
"Must be experience!"
"Poured a beautiful orange copper color with a light tan head. The aroma was a fruity with some pine notes and the alcohol smell was quite strong but was still disguised somewhat by the hoppiness. Taste is quite good. Pretty much follows the nose but I tasted less alcohol than I smelled. Much sweeter than I had expected but there is enough bitterness to help balance it out nicely. It is quite an experience on the palate. I expected for it to have more of an alcohol bite in the mouth but didn’t really feel like 18% ABV until the warmth was sliding down my throat. Can’t wait to see what a few years will do to the rest of the batch."
"BTW- this was from the batch in 2011 that ended the 20 month hiatus."
"02/28/2015 - Re-rate.  Drinking a vintage bottled on July, 2008 (almost 7 years old).  Tastes like an amazing barleywine.  4.5 overall."
"O: I was a bit skeptical about this beer at first, cramming so much alcohol into an """IIPA""" but after trying it, I will admit I am pretty impressed, this is truly extreme brewing. You can tell that this is a high ABV beer, but I wouldn't have guessed it was 20%. You really get a nice warming feel in your gut after each sip. Very unique creation."
"just finished the last sip.. ah !"
"O - Just an all around """interesting""" beer. Huge flavors meld together nicely, this bottle was 2yrs old and had mellowed into a great tasty beverage."
"What a purchase. By volume this may have been one of the most expensive beers I've ever purchased. I am sad that I had to pay so much, but understand that the product is truly superior to other beers I've had. I can't imagine drinking several of these in a sitting, or even one whole one for that matter, but have no reservations about the purchase."
"I've never had this beer fresh before so I've never thought it was fair to review it, it is an IPA at the end of the day. Dogfish Head has succeeded in making what is essentially a pure hop extract. The beer pours a perfectly filtered orange with a respectable head of about a half-pinky's height. Smells like big hop oils, with that signature DFH sweetness and the most uncanny Chinese Orange chicken sauce aroma (and I mean that in a good way). Taste is huge, perhaps too huge. Big bitterness from the hops that brings out a dirty, earthy orange rind character and heavily boiled hop essence followed by cloying molasses sweetness and a finish on the tongue that's somewhere between an evaporating shot of liquor and a light and fizzy cane sugar soda. This beer, especially if you plan to drink the whole bottle, is a big-time sipper, so don't expect to finish a glass within a matter of a mere few minutes. This, if anything, is an impressive achievement, as close to a downright oddity as I've experienced in the beer world."
"On-tap at Hoptomic. 2009 Vintage. Pours quite still and syrupy, with an appearance not too dissimilar form Polish Mead, which, incidentally, it resembles in more ways than one. The nose offers unmitigated sweetness in suggestions ranging from golden raisins to honey or mead, but despite the high ABV, alcohol is not strongly noted. The flavor carries the aroma's torch, with an addition of a modicum of actual piney hoppiness, which is impressive given the circumstances. Mouthfeel-wise, it is silky and slick; pretty good, again, given the 18%+ circumstance. Overall, it is enjoyable, and something I would consider should I have a Utopias craving and no Utopias."
"O: Despite its obvious deficiencies, 120 Minute Ale has some charm if it is compared to English Barleywines and high-octane doppelbocks. Perhaps more aging would iron out 120 Minute Ale's flaws and propel it to the upper echelon of big abv beers. At 3 years, almost all hops, both aromatic and bittering, are a distant memory, allowing sweetness to run rampant and booze to be unchecked. "
"O - I actually enjoyed this one. It has syrupy feel to it and the sweetness didn't completely overpower some of the more subtle fruit and hop flavours. I'd have it again, but would be splitting it again."
"Tastes are straight-up booze, bitter hops, shitty bourbon, flaked grains and not much else. Smells like a very powerful IPA mixed with a bourbon and a barrel. Not my """thing""". At all. Buy it if you must; costs a lot and tastes like you're being destroyed inside-out."
"O- Ive never had it fresh so I'm not sure what to compare it to, nor am I sure if it was cellared properly for 2 of the years. I would try it again for sure but I wasnt too crazy about this one."
"Overall, this was a decent brew. However, I much prefer beers like J.W. Lees if I want a beer of this ilk, i.e. strong and sweet."
"This is my unicorn, I was lucky to find it at Capone's in East Norriton PA last week on a business trip. 2008 bottle, bottled 7-8-08. Opened 5-29-11. Poured into my dfh snifter, shared with a good friend. Pours a MURKY dark dark orange, bordering on brown color. Completely opaque. Smell- buttery, sugary, some vinegar, spice, apple. Wow. A lot going on here. Taste- some astringency, a warm buttery flavor, sweet apple. Almost a tart type finish- This is very very complex. So much going on in this beer. Mouthfeel- it has lost a lot of its carbonation, but you don't even miss it here. Something about the crisp tart finish of the beer doesn't even make you think about the potential flatness of the beer. Drinkability- especially improves as it warms. Came out of my cellar at 55 degrees, and didn't really reveal itself fully until almost an hour passed. This is an epic beer....and truly demonstrates why you age beer and what it can do. My final thought is that this should be classified as an old ale after a few years...very hard to consider it part of the IPA family."
"Buy one. Age it for 5+ years. Enjoy!"
"Had the fresh batch on draft at the brewpub. Tasted a little less intense than some of the bottles I've had before. A little on the sweet side but not overwhelmingly malty. Mouthfeel is almost sticky. Golden color, a little bit lighter than the 90 minute. The alcohol sweetness overwhelms any hops. Thorougly enjoyed this one."
"overall this is not one of my favorites from DFH. at least aged. i've had it fresh(er) in the past, and recall enjoying it... this is average at best."
"I suppose that both versions are good but I prefer the fresh batch I think. Hopefully the people at DfH will be able to release this again one day so we can all enjoy or more this brew."
"O = I've had this beer a handful of times before. I recall most pleasurable experience to be fresh, on draft at Ebenezer's in Maine. I thoroughly enjoyed this tasting although I'm not certain age improves this beer. As well documented on BA, age fades hopes...if your a fan of big HOP flavors, drinking this fresh is your best bet. Still, it's rarity and limited aviability make it a treat and I will always say yes when offered."
"O - This has great drinkability. It is definitely a sipper, but great drinkability none the less. The aroma and flavor are just amazing, and it makes me not want to put my glass down. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I am very thankful that I found this bottle hanging around NYC. I definitely recommend picking this up, and giving it a shot. Great job DFH. Cheers."
"Overall I am very glad that I had the opportunity to get my hands on one of these rare breeds. It was worth it as I am a big fan of Dogfish Head 60 and 90 min IPAs as well. The 90 is by far my favorite. The rumor at the restaurant is that there are more in the back along with 2 Kegs of it as well, but who knows if its true or not. Now to get my hands on some Pliny"
"Cheers!"
"Overall, I just regret not having had the opportunity to try this back when it was fresh. I just got into cellaring and craft beer more recently than most, and don't know wha t crazy fresh beerness I'm reviewing this current incarnation against. Something to get excited about and something to seek out. I'm thoroughly impressed by what this beer has had to offer top to bottom."
"This beer by far is the most fascinating to me...bar the far the most drinkable high high alcohol beer made. It still has beer like qualities (hop flavor) but is more like a port wine..something you can drink on the rocks after a large meal. The residual sugars give it port like qualities and the body is thicker, but it is still light in color which is surprising. While expensive, it is still a better bargain than most wines and liquors... and a great conversation piece at parties."
"O: I am willing to try this again, but my memory is of a very difficult to finish beer. It was just too much for me. But hey, I got a darned good buzz off it!!"
"One would think after five years this would be past its point, I beg to differ. This beer was rock solid. I've been waiting awhile to try this and I certainly glad I did."
"The CPJ"
"D: For being 18% ABV, there isn't much of an alcohol presence, or not as much as you would expect, which is kind of scary. I think it aged well but I need to have another fresh one to compare more closely."
"Burnt orange color pour with with basically no head. Aroma was intensely sweet with wood notes. Taste has sweet like maple with a smooth hoppy underside. Mouthfeel was thick like a syrup with very little carbonation. This was a very drinkable ipa especially at the high abv %, but has a complexity that must be slowly enjoyed over time."
"D-not too bad. i split this with a bro, but i could easily get through 2 or 3, especially if paired with food. definitely worth a revisit."
"D - Well, It's obviously not that drinkable. I'm glad I split a bottle 3-ways, perhaps if I had an entire night to dedicate I could drink a bottle by myself."
"All in all, this is a great brew, but definitely not an IPA. More like a barleywine, or more closely, an old ale. If you are looking for a thick hoppy IPA bite, then you will be very disappointed. If you like sweet boozy malts brews, then you will enjoy this one."
"D- Easy to start off, but almost difficult to finish. Very strong, sweet, piney beer. Great, in small amounts."
"Worth trying once, but kind of feels gimmicky."
"Pours a bright slightly hazy orange color with a frothy two finger white head and okay lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweetness and citrus hops up front followed by grapes and a slight woodiness. The taste has a sweet caramel malt backbone and a citrus hop bite along with flavors of grapes, and liquor. The taste is very complex with flavors changing throughout the drink. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a touch of slickiness in the middle. The drinkability is high, it is actually an easy drink for the abv, also it is complex enough to make you want more expierences. It isn't a double ipa that hits you with a big hoppy character, its more of a thinking man's ipa."
"D - I was really expecting something else from this (loads of hops, tongue bruiser, etc) and was pleasantly surprised by the vinous characters. As others have said, I highly recommend splitting this guy with someone. Awesome beer, I would love to try again. Definitely not an everyday beer."
"A nice sipping beer to have by the fireplace. Although some people argue about this being a barleywine instead of an IPA I say it is really a hop liqueur."
"D = This was fun to try, but I could barely finish the bottle. The first few mouthfuls were enjoyable and interesting. But the excess sweetness after 1/2 the bottle turned me off. I would try this again and share with a friend for an after dinner drink served in a brandy snifter."
"Poured fairly nice with amber gold clarity and decent head. Smelled nice, hard presence of piney hops and malt. Taste was not balanced, too much of a malt and hop nuclear weapon with nothing in the brew to even it out. Smooth and soft, mouthfeel alone is not bad at all. Not very pleasing to imbibe on. This could be a great beer, but it stops short, unfinished. Strong alcohol and hops, but disjointed. Try it and judge for yourself."
"M/D: Thick and creamy. Much smoother than anticipated. Very fine bubbles give it a really nice mouthfeel. The alcohol was there a bit, but really not that bad. Its a sipper for sure, but I really didn't have trouble drinking it at all. Wouldn't have guessed it to be 18% if I didn't already know. Not an everyday beer, but a nice treat."
"This is a beer you drink on a dare. It's not drinkable. Maybe put a shot of it in some seltzer water."
"2008 bottle thanks to Chris. Caramel orange pour with a small white head. Nose is a hefty blast of caramel malt, sweet and earthy, musky almost. Huge, thick mouth, tons of sugar and pine sap. Bittering hops mostly overwhelmed by the sweet caramel malt. Sugars come across as orange candy, hops as pine sap. Huge beer, pretty good stuff at 3 years old."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter glass (I may had this on tap at DFH Alehouse a couple times as well). Pours hazy orange/amber with gold edges. Light head with a bit of lacing. Lots of grapefruit, sweet orange, and fresh bread, a bit of piney hops on the nose. Velvety mouthfeel. Just a bit of bite on the front of the tongue, quickly disappears into a very grapefruity, sweet citrus, and a bit of herbal hops. Very surprisingly, the hops are not obnoxiously overdone. The peppery alcohol is very dominant, but the 21% is VERY well hidden. Bitterness of cooked apple on the finish. This was one of my first extreme beers and one I had to shell out big bucks for. A classic craft beer for me."
"NOTES: The beer is rich, thick, flavorful, and the 18.0% ABV comes through quite obviously. This is a beer that you drink, more likely than not, as a special occasion beer. Like you would have a nice Scotch or Cognac. The 120 Min is definitely a beer that opens up as it nears room temperature, you need to let it warm to fully appreciate it."
"The mouthfeel was smooth but expanding carbonation gave it a liveliness. Even the mouthfeel was complex. This has turned into a world class beer. Finally a DFH beer I can love. Generally I'm not a big fan - I don't like the their 60 and 90 min. IPAs at all. Aged 120 is the beer for me!"
"D: Not something I could have more than one of and at that with a good distance between them, but still an unbelievably complex and deep beer meant for a cold night and a good snifter."
"Highly recommended. Aged or fresh, this one is a hit."
"D- It's 18%! god damn how drinkable could that be?! This thing goes down like a liqour its as drinkable as this high in abv comes."
"Like a beer liqueur."
"2007 vintage. 12 oz bottle split with a buddy. Pours a thick dark golden with the shimmer that tells you there is a lot of booze/sugar in there and with much more head than expected. Actually looks fantastic. Smell is almost fusel alcohol and intense sugary. The smell is essentially not good. The taste, however, is sublime. Sweet like an aged American Barleywine with faded hops in the middle the finishes with slight bitterness. There is an almost bready sweetness present throughout that I don't find cloying and somehow seems in balance with the rest of the beer. Great mouthfeel, with good carbonation and that thickness the beer essentially has to posses. Makes a wonderfully smooth sipper - very drinkable for the alcohol content."
"I enjoyed this better than I remember - maybe once I knew how sweet it was, my expectations were calibrate & I was just ready to embrace it. So much more like a barleywine than an IPA, this is a sweet mother with almost no bitterness. The alcohol isn't that apparent while drinking, but I definitely feel a little goofy after half of a glass. Enjoyable, but I'm happy with this one once a year, tops."
"D: I'd drink this like I would a brandy or a cognac. A bottle by myself would probably be enough for an evening. Sharing one with one or two friends is probably the best bet for this brew."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. More then I wanted to, actually (due to the price)... I thought it would be a one-time novelty, but I could easily see myself drinking it again. I did have a fresh batch and it was a WHOLE different animal. Hops and alcohol were much more ferocious. I prefer it aged (unless I'm in a particularly spicy/hoppy mood)."
"I always try to get a couple of these every year and try to let them age."
"A floraly front with a sweet caramel after-taste. I am certain aging has done this brew well. An excellent beer from dogfish. I would recommend anyone to seek this beer out (if they can find it!). I can't wait for them to re-release this one!"
"An aroma of dark fruit,raisins,plums a bit piney/citrusy too..pours opague orange color and white head that dissipates lacing good though..taste hits you with a winy fruity sweetness but counterbalanced by hop bittterness at the end. very drinkable and inviting so be careful. the abv will still catch up on you ..light tingly carbonation and lingering aftertaste,very satisfying in all respects. VERY GOOD."
"12 oz bottle. Pours copper with no head and lots of carbonation. Aroma is of citrus hops, caramel malt , ripe fruit and licorice. Palate is similar, nicely balanced. Full, sharp, body. Huge balanced finish, with lots of warming alcohol. Almost perfect after dinner beer."
"This is a ridiculous beer. Bottled on 11/05/08 it pours like a regular IPA which considering the abv is insane. A good head that stays forever and leaves lot of lace. Smell is lots of malt and a decent amount hops but not as much as you would expect. There is an alcohol/solvent/cleaning fluid facet as well. Lots of pine. Taste is not for the faint of heart. Super sweet malt and syrup. A large fruit flavor dominates. Orange really. Huge amount of hops to keep it in check and still it is more sweet than bitter. Having said that the finish is entirely owned by the buds. Super clean and dry with enough hop oil to hack through the high gravity sugars. Mostly pine in nature there is just enough grapefruit to cut and dry your mouth so you keep coming back. Feel is just short of thick and chewy. It is surprisingly close to your run of the mill DIPA. Carbonation is lively and right where you want it. Any more and the flavors get out of control any less and you are drinking syrup from the bottle. Drinkability is much better than it should be. Yes you sip it but I find myself sipping faster and faster. An awesome AND ridiculous beer."
"Pours an amber burnt orange with a thing head that dissipates quickly, leaving some great lacing along the side through the whole beer experience. Alot of fragrance in the nose, caught some hop oil as well as a sweet syrupy smell. Mouthfeel is sticky and full, coats the mouth and stays around. Taste is serious! alot of carmel and raisions maybe. I bought this beer over a year ago, and am very pleased with how it has changed. I have six more of these in my cellar and am looking forward to seeing how much better they get."
"My girlfriend treated me to this on my birthday at Beer Bistro in Toronto. Pours a light brown almost burgundy colour with a very thin head that didn't stick around too long. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells like caramel, slight hops and warm alcohol. Very thick mouthfeel that brought forth a sweet caramel and brown sugar taste. There is a faint hop presence that hags out in the cheeks and sides of the tongue. Very complex each sip gave way to new flavours. I have to say it was much sweeter than I thought it would be, but still one of the best I have tried. Would love to try one fresh to see how it differs from the 3 1/2 year old one I had."
"Overall this was a great choice for my after dinner dessert and I am really glad that I have been aging this for for three years now. I would recommend that if you come across this beer be sure to get a few bottles. I really think you will enjoy the experience of trying it over a several years. Considering this is 18% ABV it drinks very easily and one bottle can be shared by a few people if you don't feel like the huge head rush from the whole twelve ounces and for $8 it is a pretty cheap buy."
"D: another sipper, but is very easy to sip with not to much alcohol burn."
"Served from bottle into goblet at about 40F form a 2009 bottle. This is a interesting beer, no doubt. The initial aroma is of cider and whiskey- no doubt due to the ridiculous amount of malt present in the wort. The aroma is strong- much stronger than I'm used to from any other beer. The flavor is very sweet and syrupy- somewhat too sweet to be very drinkable. Surprisingly enough there is almost no taste of alcohol or hops- the sugary sweetness of this brew masks everything else. There is an obvious skill to making a beer this extreme but the results are less than wholly enjoyable on flavor alone. This would be best extremely cold or, perhaps, on tap."
"Special thanks to BeerMan1965 for his expertise and most importantly, the bottle of beer itself. Thank you!"
"Quite a nice sipper, but as I remember my first SA triple bock I wonder how far this has pushed the envelope on what is considered beer."
"D-surprisingly next to no alcohol note or burn. this is very impressive to me. this is definitely best shared with someone or else it might be your only beer of the night. it tastes great all the way through!!"
"Overall this is a great drink/beer. Its strength makes me not even want to call it a beer but it is definitely a nice sipper, it may not feel tremendously assertive early on but holds its own very enticingly as it progresses."
"Overall I was a little disappointed, to me this was much more like a barley wine than an imperial IPA. I drank it more for the novelty of drinking something that strong. I would drink it again, but the price prevents this from being a regular."
"M/D: Feel is slimy and overly thick, and this is as drinkable as fish eyes mixed with camel spew."
"A+"
"D: After a second drink to see if we could swallow it a second time, (we couldn't) spit and pour into the trees. I hope it doesn't kill my tree..."
"D- ? What drinkability? I liked this beer, the taste was well-rounded but damn, the overpowering alcohol will turn many off."
"It had a big-bodied but silky texture, and although it certainly tasted and felt boozy, it goes down just fine if treated like a fine liqueur. Overall, this one was so interesting and different, I wish NC allowed for its sale so that I could grab a couple more bottles."
"I think people look at this too much as a beer. I think we need to see this as more than beer. It's closer to ice wine in flavor. Sweet, syrupy with notes of grape and pure sugar cane. The hops are muted, but isnt that the point here. At 18%+, what do you expect? This is an after dinner drink, one you could sit down to with a cigar and relax with. Great job to Dogfish Head and they're forward thinking on beer. We need to look at beer as an art, not a bitter sparkling mess. Beer is the new wine, think of it in that fashion and then try this again. For me, this is what beer should be, art in a glass...Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability: sipper"
"D/O- Drinkability is near zero but loved every second of my 6 ounce glass...split a 12 ounce bottle of this 18% monster with a friend who then blew a .4 on my BAC device. Been looking forward to this day for awhile after having many 60 and 90 Minutes. Thanks PTMcB!"
"D-Ok, so much for the hype. I appreciate the uniqueness and can say I tried it. Bought two bottles and will give the other away as a novelty. I also ate a chocolate covered bug once, just to say I did. I think I enjoyed the bug much more than this."
"D - Hmm, how to describe the drinkability of an 18% beer. Well, it's not the best thing I've ever had, but it is unique and interesting. A sipper for sure, although I'm sure I'm plowing through this way too fast and it's gonna hurt. Can't say that I'm looking for another beer after this one is done. At this point I'd lean heavily towards calling this a barleywine instead of a DIPA. Maybe I should have waited another couple of months for some cooler weather, but I've been staring at this in my fridge for too long...it had to be done. This is almost liquor like and definitely more fitting as an after dinner drink than anything else. Got another one of these with about the same age on it...think I will share with a friend when the time is right...probably a good thing for both of us."
"Drinkability: I loved this one and it is now one of my favorites from DFH. I have had this before the aging and the hops are more pronounced, but I love the mellowness from the age. This one drinks more like a great barleywine. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
"Show me the man that drinks a six-pack of this, and I'll show you a man that needs to be hauled off to somewhere! Though that may hurt drinkability, this is such a neat, innovative beverage. Who would've thought to bomb a beer with so much hops it's strong enough to approach disgusting , yet market the beer like it's the holy grail for all we adore? DFH, that's who--well done. ;^)"
"Overall, this beer was nothing like I expected. The hops were not nearly as potent as I expected and it was bottled just under a year ago. The bottle says it can be aged for a decade or more, I would hate to taste a decade old version of this because the hops would be non-existent. This reminded me more of and old ale or barelywine than an double ipa. I don't think I'll drink this beer again, but beer enthusiasts should give it a shot just because its so extreme."
"D: Definitely something to have every once in awhile not something i would suggest but only for rare occasions. An acquired taste"
"Initial flavor is heavy sweet with a moderately sweet finish. Really coats teh tongue and a nice warming effect. Very syrupy. Ovbiously one couldn't drink more than two of these in a night, but really fantastic."
"I have four more bottles and I will lay down at least two of them for at least 2-3 years. I can't even begin to imagine how great they will be then."
"OVERALL: Certainly an extreme beer to say the least, even if I'd guess that this batch probably didn't get up to the 18% listed on the site. Nevertheless, this was an awesome brew to try and it was a lot of fun to do all three of the Minute series back to back to back. It was actually surprsingly drinkable for what it was. That said, this was my least favorite of the three, as it's simply too boozy and malty sweet for a DIPA. I am, however, forever grateful I had the chance to try it. Thanks a lot NewGeneric for making this one happen for me."
"I look forward to trying this beer as fresh as possible when the next batch comes out. This one was over a year old and although I did enjoy it, it didn't really wow me as I had hoped."
"I have to say after having a WWS and feeling sickened about how strong the alcohol came through in the nose and taste I was a little hesitant to try this. but I must say this really blew me away I enjoyed every sip of it and can't wait for August's batch to come my way to try one as fresh as possible."
"Won't shell out 10 bucks for this again. Laughing at the fact this this is supposed to be some kind of DIPA."
"Pours a hazy amber orange with a smallish head which dissolves into a thin coating. Lacing is probably good considering the ABV. Nose is alcohol, caramel and some citrus - mango, grapefruit, apricots, cherries, and dark fruit. Taste is VERY sweet and boozy. This is an IPA? Raisin, plum, sweet malts and the alcohol burn completely overpowered any hops for me. Mouthfeel is relatively heavy, creamy, and very syrupy. This is much too sweet and boozy for me. It certainly is a unique offering but I will take the 60 and 90 minute over this any day. Here's hoping the 2010 version makes a LOT of changes..."
"Not super easy to drink, but good considering the abv."
"...and it sure is more interesting than Yanjing or Tsingtao!"
"Surprisingly my usual pour leads to a decent sized parchment head that is quite creamy and has decent staying power. The beer itself is a fiery orange amber that looks dangerous. The aroma tells me this must be a pretty fresh bottle. It is malty for sure, but I am able to pick out a nice orange, grapefruit, apricot and sweet flowery hop bouquet as well. I've had this beer several times, and every time I seem to take something different away from the experience. It is extremely sweet with a very sugar cookie like pale malt profile. The hops are much less prominent than in the aroma, but I am still detecting the classic """minute""" hop profile that this shares with its smaller siblings. Candied orange, apricot, pine and cidery sweetness. If this was a hoppy barley wine, it would be great, but for a triple IPA, not quite enough punch. If the ABV was toned down a bit I think this would be a real winner through and through. The body is full and thick, fairly syrupy really, with a finish that is a bit on the sticky icky side, but could be much worse. I just realized that I keep having to remind myself that this thing has a near 20% ABV. It is hot without a doubt, but not as hot as one would expect. This is a sipper and not all that drinkable, but I always welcome the chance to share a bottle with a friend."
"This beer poured beautifully and smelled great. The smell was ultra hoppy with some appricot. The mouthfeel was about the same as the smell, but the drink was a bit too much for my liking, but everything that I heard the beer would be, so A for this brew!"
"Notes: Glad I saved this meal-in-itself for after dinner (there aren't many beers out there of which a single 12-oz bottle would concern me as regards calories, but this one certainly qualifies as such). I've read (on the internet and on the bottle itself) that this beer ages particularly well. Most IPAs I try to drink as fresh as possible, but this could be an exception. If there is a way to bring out the complexities of this brew, and a way to tame it a bit, then that's exactly what I want to do. Simpler than its ultra-strong DFH counterpart, World Wide Stout, it's not so elusive to me; it doesn't hide behind anything. And unlike World Wide Stout, which costs a great deal more, I WILL be buying this again, probably soon!"
"D: I don't know how this is categorized as an IPA and not straight vinegar. Sour from the nose to the mouth but the sad thing is, I can barely get the sourness in the taste because its covered by the immense alcohol. Don't waste your money. I'm glad this was shared because if I had it myself, I would've sipped about an ounce and drain-poured the rest. DFH makes a line of great IPAs with their 60, 75, and 90 minute beers. However, for me, this is definitely the odd man out. Its horrible."
"Fantastic. Buy a handful every year and cellar them. The verticals of these are so fun to drink, but be sure to share with friends. One of the baddest IPA's on the market. Huge floral hop that mellows over time. Give it a year and the powerful sweet malt begins to surface. Evolves in character and complexity creating an exciting experience every time I pull one out of the cellar."
"enjoyable in small portion for too much and you're through."
"This is certainly an extreme beer, and i applaud DFH for that, but it probably should be thought of as closer to a liquor than a beer. It is certainly not sessionable, and not something I'd care to have a lot, but an interesting and worthwhile experience nonetheless."
"Seems more like an English Barleywine to me. Certainly an interesting beer that is fun to try, but this will be a once a year thing at most."
"Taste is...shall we say, unique? Thick, rich sugar coated grapefruit juice, lots of hop flavor but not a whole lot of bitterness. Very sweet, port wine with a squeeze of lemon. Like grappa mixed with cognac, crazy brew. I would say this was worth the price for the experience alone, although I cant say for sure whether or not I would buy one again. Split between 3 people would be about right."
"I was really looking forward to this, after loving 60 and 90 minute IPA so much. This is not was I was expecting at all. This is nothing like those beers. I expected a stronger taste, but the hop character I loved in 60 and 90 is not present. This feels more like drinking a liquor than a DIPA."
"D. Wonderful sipper! Quite a treat- proceed with caution."
"D- enough said. Takes the cake. Be careful"
"Sipped this beer for a while and loved every drop of it."
"Served from bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Pours a nice yellow-copper color with a minimal white head. There was minimal lacing throughout. Aroma comprised of nice hop notes with alcohol. The flavor of this brew was a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness with an alcohol flavor that intensifies upon swallowing. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very strange IPA. The alcohol content is pretty high so drink in moderation. Trust me... I know."
"summary: Interesting beer. I might buy a few more to cellar and I hope to try it fresh on tap one day soon."
"Not sure how to review this one. Its certainly not an IPA. Oh well here we go. Pours a dark golden cloudy orange. Aroma is at first grapefruit, but quickly moves to candied figs and raisins. Its really the aroma of a Belgian Quad. Taste follows, more sweet fruitcake and warm toasty malts. Its very sweet, but in a good way. A great cold weather sipper. If blindfolded I never would have pegged this as an IPA. I am most surprised by the tameness of the booze. Of course this one has aged for over a year. I don't think I would want a fresh one, but after a year its a very tasty brew. Its just not an IPA."
"D-Definitely a sipper. Very warming. I'd love to sip this on a cold winter night. Very balanced with alot of big flavors. Very complex. A very enjoyable brew."
"Bottle aged exactly 1 year (5-1-09). Pours very dark amber, lots of carbonation bubbles, there's actually a 1-finger head! And it stays good the whole time while leaving nice lacing. Very surprising for the alcohol content. Color of the head is off-white, somewhat yellow almost. Some dusty sediment as well. Booze is quite up-front in the nose, also getting hops and grapefruit. Taste is better than I thought it would be, first thing I notice is the alcohol is very well-hidden (I think this batch was 21%). It's there, but I would've guessed 12 or 13%. Malts are definitely overpowering the hops. It is very sweet, but not overly so. The main tastes I can get are grapefruit, vanilla, it has a liquor-like presence, almost like thick scotch or rum. Bready and boozy in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good overall, but the syrupy-ness, sweetness and booze starts to get to you after a while. Drinkability is obviously low, for those reasons, who would drink 2 of these anyway? I've never had this fresh but I'd say age did this beer some good. I liked it much more than I thought it would. If I see an '08 around maybe I'll pick it up, I'd like to see what this beer is like after """a decade or so""" like on the label."
"D: This was worth it for the novelty alone, but even my small pour was a chore off this fresh bottle. This challenges drinkability. I would not have this beer again. Vile stuff."
"pours a copper orange color with spare pearl white head and spare lacing. lots of fizzy carbonation. floral hoppy aroma which is probably the most tranquil smell i have ever smelled before. a bit of a perfume like hoppy taste that reminds me of a feeling similiar to falling in love for the first time. the taste of alcohol is apparent but not as forward as i would've thought. long flavor duration that is very sweet and just a tad bit bitter. This is probably if not the best, the second best beer i have ever drank. simply amazing. you will certainly have a really good buzz going after your first one. would be my everyday beer of choice if it wasn't so pricey, and i didn't have work and other shit to do on a regular basis that takes up perfectly good drinking time. if you haven't tried it i suggest you do so now. if you are a lightweight i would take your time this beer will creep up behind you and punch you in the neck. one of the best experiences i've ever had drinking a beer."
"Nothing like it.... Has to be experienced... it's been described as a hop liqueur...yeah I can see that."
"I've waited quite a while to try this one and now that it's over I'm a little relieved, this is a extreme beer and everyone should try it at least once just for the novelty alone. I would like to try a 10 year old bottle and see if it mellows out a bit. thanks ritzkiss for knocking this one of my want list."
"D - not something I could drink often. Maybe like once a year is good for me but I'd really like to see how it ages."
"medium bodied,drinkable despite the abv.worth picking up a bottle.i'd like to try a fresh one."
"Overall, i was suprised at how hoppy this beer continued to be even with the high abv. I also expected the alcohol to have a stronger presence. quite good, but at halfway through, my face is already feeling quite warm."
"Pours golden amber, with a minimal amount of white head. A very sweet and boozy aroma, with maybe a touch of floral hoppiness. On the palate, I get sweet honey malt, apricots, a bit of citrus and alcohol. Very syrupy and sweet, the hops are nowhere near enough to balance this one out. A somewhat one dimensional beer, not for everyday drinking."
"D: While this is one rather good beer, and very drinkable, I'd probably not have another due to the high alcohol content."
"A rare find, this beer is definitely one of the best."
"D - Drank almost the entire bottle to myself and would not suggest anyone else do the same, tried to share it with a loved one but she was not into it at all, so i would suggest finding a friend or loved one interested in sharing it, as it would be a great beer to talk about while drinking. I would strongly recommend any hop-head or beer lover give this one a try, even though it was not my favorite but now i would like to try an aged bottle and see if some sweetness recedes."
"D-if your going into thinking it's 18% then your fine and oh yeah don't drink alone."
"D - fairly drinkable for an 18%; if anything the oddly strong sweet->bitter balance is harder to stomach. There are some beers out there (eg Russian river) that have really sold me on the taste (and expense!) of big IPAs; this one is a nice attempt but didn't fully win me over."
"Copper/amber color with no head. This thing is all sweet in the nose. Burnt sugar, molasses, and caramel. The hops are there but really covered by the sweet malts and the alcohol. Tastes about the same...uber sweet. It's just way to sweet for me. I know that's a product of the high ABV, but I'd like to see more hop presence. I've been sitting on this for a while, but a bit of a letdown."
"This beer pours a copper color with a thin white foamy head that quickly fizzles out. The nose is hoppy but not in the traditional IPA way, it is more like carmalized hops with a little heat from the high ABV. The palate come across as sweet with flavors of carmalized orages and baking spices. The high ABV starts to show through n the finish with some heat. Great beeer just not something you would drink everyday"
"Wow, this is the cognac of beer by far. This is an extreme beer!! Certainly should be shared with a friend and enjoyed as a sipper (no funnel here). This beer is best served as an after dinner treat."
"M/D- Great session beer for a few people to share. I had two buddies share a bottle that I purchased afterwards because I enjoyed it so much. It is a one and done type of beer but all should enjoy it atleast once."
"It took me an hour and a half to savour this ale and I really enjoyed the experience. 120 isn't a """proper""" DIPA but it's still a complex and pleasing drink in its own right. Cheers to DFH for constantly reshaping my perception of what beer can be."
"split four ways, i get the last pour. pours an impenetrable amber. mine (full of sediment) was the color of a dirty brown apple cider. no head, but a thin, swamp like film. the smell is strong strong strong. rubbing alcohol? elmers glue? paint thinner? strong toffee/caramel and sweet floral hops, all overpowered by the alcohol content. luckly, the taste isn't as jacked up. taste is good. caramel, hot booze, cider. some cognac like qualities, nice, but deadly. chewy and thick. strong toffee and caramel malt as it warms and much more drinkable at room temp. i could go without the smell, but all in all an interesting experience. at nine bucks a pop, i won't be getting another until a fresh batch comes out, but it was cool to try an aged one."
"I'm glad I got to try it, but at $9.75 for 12 ounces from the discount store I won't be returning to it often."
"Overall it was a great experience and I did not even blink at the $18 it cost me. I would probably enjoyed this a bit more if I had found it earlier in the evening!"
"D: This is akin to cognac or brandy or port. For what it is, it's drinkable (sippable), but splitting one of these is the way to go."
"It is a wonderful beer for the hop fans... i really enjoyed it, but it took me about an hour to sip it down. Even thought it has a hefty price tag it is well worth it!"
"The drinkability is probably better than expected for the abv, but obviously not great."
"Drinkability - I will have another this week! Very easy to drink, slight alcohol burn on back of throat that fades pretty quickly. I have one I've been aging since 2006, can't wait to try it!"
"I don't really know how to rate the drinkability of a beer like this. Would I want to drink more than 12oz. of this? No. But it was extremely smooth and enjoyable considering the high abv."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but it is not easy to drink, and its a lot sweeter than I would expect for an IPA. I may pick this up again, but I'm not really sure"
"M/D- very full bodied. a sipper for sure. I'm a huge fan of the 60 and 90 mins, but i think i'll pass on the 120 next time, especially at the price tag. I was expecting a huge hop profile on this but was dissapointed by that."
"The beer poured a clear, honey-amber with a thin, white head that dissipated quickly into a chalice. The smell was of clean, crisp, citrusy hops and alcohol. The initial flavor was an immediate hit of alcoholic esters, with malt sweetness in the middle, with more alcoholic warmness and hop bitterness at the finish - fantastic! A bit oily mouthfeel, with malt sweetness, hops, and alcohol flavors lingering long, long after the swallow. Wish it wasn't so expensive, but still a great, super-high octane brew."
"Libation: As I stated previously, this is a sippin' beer. I really, really like DIPAs, but this is just to much of an experiment for me. According to Sam Calagione, this beer is """dry hopped every day for a month""" but it still seems much more malty sweet than hoppy. I truly appreciate some aspects of the 120, but maybe I'm just not ready for this sort of punch in the mouth yet. I'm not sure I'll ever be ready for it."
"To enjoy this beer, you should know what you are getting yourself into. Beautiful color, very sweet and alchoholy nose, tastes much more like mead or honey. Almost no sign of bitterness you would expect from an imperial ipa. All that said, a very good beer for sipping and sharing, but dont think you'll be tossing a couple of these back on a hot summer day."
"I will tell you this... just sit back and enjoy, take your time and soak it all in.... Now I'm not a big IPA kind of guy but this one rang my bell.... A must try !!! I'm going to buy another a let it sit for 2 years or more and give it a try."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It had a nice smell of hops and a hint of orange. The texture really surprised me, it was thicker than I anticipated. There was a strong alcohol burn on each swallow. Definately a beer to drink in moderation. As the beer warmed more flavors released. Wonderful IPA, a must have!"
"Serving type: on-tap"
"D: Drinkable, yes, very, much like a port. But not something I would want all that much of and nothing I would NEED all that much of. Definitely something I am glad to have tried and something I would get again if I came across it at the right time, but not something I would seek out."
"Not a favorite of mine. It's simply too sweet for my tastes, and the alcohol overpowers the other flavors."
"Poured a clear honey amber with a nice white head. Very sweet, citrusy, with a hint of pine resin. Lots of caramel and alcohol as well. Lots of bitterness in the finish and maybe a hint of cognac too. Hops linger long after the finish. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is good for the amount of alcohol given."
"I love this beer. Not much to say about it. Not very complex. But it sure is dangerously delicious."
"Wow."
"This beer is intense. The pour is a hazy gold/orange, and it laces quite well. At first I couldn't even deal with the aroma. It was so intense that I really had to let this breathe and have an opportunity to really open up. Nose is all about the hops. Pure concentrated hop juice. Citrus oils and solvents are upfront, huge bread crust malts follow, with all I can describe as hop fuel. it is really just hops all the way, and not in a way I have encountered before. Upon first taste, I was unprepared for the experience, and let the beer sit for a while longer. I poured a 4 oz sample, and that was more than enough at first. Straight up hops, tonnes of citric pithy flavours, some fuesel components, orangey malts, very alcoholic. The hops here are an all out pine blast. Like eating pure pine needle extract. This is so intense that I had to drink it over 2 days, 3 servings. This is a boozey hop fest in the mouth. Not for the beginner or faint of heart. This is a sipper, and I think this one should be aged for a few years to really let the intensity become a bit more well rounded. Overall, it has huge alcoholic and pine notes in the finish, syrupy and sweet. An experience I will remember for sure. A good beer, but perhaps a little too intense for everyday enjoyment. Certainly a treat! Thanks again Eric!"
"D - The high alcohol content and extreme sweetness make this one I don't plan to pick up again. If you are a hophead, you'll probably really dig this beer, but this one is not for the faint of heart."
"This beer was quite complex and much better than I expected. It hides the 18% ABV beautifully. I've had English barleywines with little more than half as much alcohol that tasted way stronger than this. I thought the sweetness of the beer was more its downside than the alcohol heat."
"..."
"Cloudy, pumpkin amber with a creamy finger of eggshell foam that leaves rings of lace on the glass. Beer schnapps is how a German friend of mind described the nose on this one, and it's not a bad description. Floral hops and sweet malt with a touch of rum. Rich, hot buttered rum with enough hop bitterness to just stand up to the malt onslaught. A fabulously balanced sipper and way better than Utopias as far as extreme alcohol beers go in my opinion. Sticky and full bodied with perfect carbonation. A great beer for sipping slowly."
"Mouthfeel was thick & sweet but not as thick as I expected. Drinkability was not so overly high though. After a sip I was not craving another, though I was satisfied by the sip I just took."
"D: No, I will not drink more of these a day... more than one a week, or a month. But I'd love to try it again with a different age (I think this bottle was late 2008)... and after 1/3 of the snifter I was starting to talk a bit of gibberish. Lots of fun! Worth the try for the experimental experience alone."
"That being said I could drink the 60 minute IPA by the gallon. Don't want to give the impression that DFH is inferior. Great brewery I just cannot like this one."
"Drink: Definitely a sipping beer and can definitely warm you up on cold days like this. High alcohol content that can kick your ass may be able to finish one but not more than that in one sitting. This beer has received a lot of hype in which I cannot completely jump on board with...not saying that I would not have another one, but I would slightly prefer the 90 min IPA. Nonetheless, a great beer to share or to hog if you want to get messed up!!!"
"Huge thanks to ericwo for sending this growler of 2008 120 Minute IPA. Pours a rich amber color into the glass with a thick fluffy one finger white head that slowly recedes to lacing. The smell is mostly apricot and rich, sweet hops and lots of them. The taste is overwhelmingly hops, hops and more hops. They take on a sweet apricot flavor that I really like. The body is full and rich. Sweet like candy and subtly strong. Age has hidden the alcohol well and this beer has really smoothed out but not even halfway through the glass I already feel the effects. In theory I could drink this beer all night long but in reality I won't last past another glass. This might be my favorite beer."
"Absolutely amazing. This beer is a one of a kind. The masters at Dogfish certainly have some balls on them. I truely feel bad for those who think Miller Light and the like are good beers. More for me I guess; their loss. This beer is well worth the $8.50/12oz bottle price tag."
"Super sweet taste. A sipper for sure. Not hoppy at first sip...yet very boozy and a warm burn down the throat. Once you get past the first sip or 2...now the hops come into play. Very pleasant, yet still potent! As it wams up...now theres's a bitterness and sour flavor coming through. Still sipping...and still enjoying. Very nice IPA."
"I guess I need to try a fresh bottle to compare, but this aged one is really great if you are looking more for a barleywine type brew."
"they would have tasted better on spaghetti."
"this beer went a little too quick for me, this is definitely gonna be a tradition on 1/20 to drink this, i really need to get a case and try it on-tap"
"D - A sipper, of course. Very nice to linger over one all evening. Just one."
"I truly can not imagine anyone in their right mind actually enjoying this beer."
"I like how Dogfish Head push the boundaries and refuse to be constrained by anything, but this beer is a huge miss for me. The alcohol is too apparent, the hops don't shine as they should for a big imperial IPA, and everything is just too muddled and unbalanced. Add to that, its not the best beer to pair with pizza!"
"Cheers!"
"D- With the extremely high ABV this is one at a time there chief"
"Shared this with my brother and my cousin. It was their first Dogfish Head experience -- one that they enjoyed. They actually liked this more than Russian River Consecration (one of my favorites), with which I completely disagree. Never the less, good times and good drinks were had by all."
"OVERALL: Holy Crap! Now it's kicking in. It is the only beer I've had tonight and it is hitting me already. I guess that's what happens when you drink a beer that is really the equivalent of about three. I heard and read a lot about this beer before I tried it, but it really surprised me. In some ways I was surprised that others were right about it and in other ways I just didn't see it coming. If you're looking for super-intense hops (as I was) this is not your beer, but if you're looking for something unique, different and original than this is an excellent beer. Despite it not being what I was hoping it would be, I am still very happy with it and look forward to having another...but on another night, cause in the famous words of Dave Chappelle as Sam Jackson """It'll getcha drunk!""""
"Good beer from DFH. Glad to have tried it."
"D- This one bottle is very drinkable, but the alcohol and bottle price should keep consumption to a minimum."
"Slightly syrupy but I really do find this beer enjoyable to say the least. okay maybe not anytime drinker best at night but drinkability I still put reasonably high. I drank a Sam Adams Imperial stout before this and I really am ready for another."
"Can't get into the flavors, so disappointed expectation wise. This is like the port of beers. No thanks."
"Drinkability: Good for a few sips as a novelty, after that too much over-sweet liqueur and alcohol. I guess you need all the sugar and malt to bump the ABV so high, but it comes out disgusting."
"Drinkability is really not bad at all, even for a beer of half the ABV this has. This is one of the more dangerous brews out there as far as drunkenness power goes, as it definitely doesn't feel like 21% ABV."
"D: You probably shouldn't drink more than one of these. Not only for the high ABV, but ranging $9-10, you are getting your money's worth."
"overall i really do like this..its nowhere near the sweet mess i thought it would be...the hops do make an appearance..this is a unique beer"
"This beer is very good, it has a thick flavor, decent head, good lacing. This beer is almost boarder line hop bomb in my mouth. High in ABV, this beer will slam you, and fast, if you drink fast like me. I can't really explain further how good this beer is. It had me feeling pretty good after just one."
"All in all it's a pretty damn good beer, although I enjoy the 90 minute more. Not your traditional IPA, but what else can you expect from Dogfish Head?"
"Not sure if I would have one again, just thought I would try it. I was let down by the minimal to no appearance that the hops make. Why say """this is the holy grail for hop heads""" when the closest thing I can say the boozy syrup taste to is Black Tuesday."
"I have to add that I split one 12 oz bottle with someone and am feeling the alcohol in this stuff like a hammer on the head. This is what you're paying for with this one, it seems."
"I would definitely recommend. Will be picking up again when I see it available for sure."
"I am having this brew at home. I bought a case of it at the Forestville distributer here in PA. A bit pricey at $161. Not the first time I have had this beer. This is a beer I keep coming back to out of curiosity."
"Not for everyone. The alcohol in the bottle i had was quite pronounced and might be hard for some to put down. Perhaps the ABV really is a bit higher than it should be. This is a completely different experience then the 90 minute; I would have probably classified it as a barleywine if not for the label. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this. A serious brew for sure."
"Called the """holy grail""" of hopped beer. Probably not the greatest tasting beer out there but I must admit I appreciate the punch it packs and it grows on you. I drank this in a flute glass and followed up with a cigar afterwards. Definitely did not want to challenge the flavor with a cigar during consumption. One thing I would appreciate would be an increase in the IBUs. The beer is a little bit sweet and almost syrupy. There is not very much foam involved. As already mentioned in other reviews not necessarily a session brew but definitely worth a try."
""""Smells like vinegar and Easter Egg dye.""""
"really astounding beer, the only thing that hurts it is that it is a little bit to much at times, but the taste and smell are phenomenal, the kind of beer Jesus would drink (not being sacrilegious just attempting humor)."
"Served in my DFH chalice. Bottled on 12/18/2006 indicated on the bottle. Poured a semi-translucent plum color with a frothy, half inch, off-white/buttery-colored head that quickly dispersed into dense clusters of bubbles, with a dollop of foam in the center. Some spotty strands of lacing revealed on the tilt side of the glass. Huge, malty nose, definitely reminiscent of a barleywine. Lots of dark fruit (i.e. plums and prunes) and breadiness, with a suggestion of citrus acidity in the mix. Taste consistent with nose - wow, this is a total malt bomb; also getting some brown sugar and molasses in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a light, smooth background carbonation and a slightly oily quality. This is a pretty decadent treat. One will certainly do you; however, the alcohol is very well-hidden for an 18% brew. Not at all, what I expected in the way of a DIPA, but pleasant experience nonetheless. Definitely one of my DFH faves."
"I wish I had bought two, one to drink now and one to lay down, but I didn't and I didn't have enough control to save my single for later."
"Drinkability is good for such a strong beer. But logic dictates go easy, go slow, and don't session."
"D: Wow... this is 18%+? Really? Goes down very easy. About halfway through it is starting to kick in, i think two would have made this review much more interesting."
"This is one hell of a beer experience. Almost a combination of American barleywine and a fine single malt Scotch. It's most definitely a sipper, to say the least; In order to decipher all of the flavor components I downed a little more than anticipated and the alcohol certainly has a warming bite afterward. Time to sit back and enjoy the rest of this delight. One 12 ounce bottle is certainly enough to split between two people. I can only imagine the sleepy-headedness that the older, higher-alcohol variants displayed. I've one bottle laid down to age; can't wait to see how it changes with time."
"Drink ability was above average. Definitely a sipper, took over an hour to finish. Very complex beer, one of a kind. Would buy again, probably best to share the bottle though."
"Bottled on 02/02/09, poured into a Warsteiner flute glass. This brew pours an orange, cloudy body with a thick head, but not much lacing. Right off the bat my nose picks up dark fruits, and alcohol, lots of alcohol. My tastebuds follow my nose, where I get a strong boozy taste but a delicous fruity one too. This would be an amazing brew if the alcohol calmed down, maybe a year or two in the cellar will do the trick. The label states that it is the holy grail for hopheads. I find that misleading as I could not notice an abundance on hops. This shouldn't be classified as an IPA in my opinion. This one drinks as a barley-wine to me, and not a bad one at that."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into pint glass. Cloudy orange in appearance with decent head, minimal lacing. Lots of carbonation. Pronounced hop smell, sweet/caramel notes with some faint dark fruit notes. Alcohol is very apparent in the nose but not offensive. Very sweet, caramel and bready malt taste with a nice warming quality. Lacks any of the citrus flavors typical of an IPA. Silky almost syrupy."
"D: Slowly but surely this goes down. I am having dinner in between the first and last ten sips. Opening another of anything would be silly - or a sign of alcoholism. Still, it IS eminently drinkable, both at 45 degrees and room temp. This is a brew that I would happily down every so often."
"(reviewed by Daniel)"
"A very intriguing beer that does not come across as an Imperial IPA."
"Overall it was tasty, if not quite as delicious as I recall it being when I had it in the bottle (or especially when I aged it). Pours an amber with a medium head, some lacing. Aromas of strong Belgian candy, fruit, caramel. Flavor is likewise - strong Belgian sugar, caramel, light tartness. Syrupy and a little granular. Peach brandy. Overall, tasty and certainly unique, but not something I'd drink all night."
"D: A great beer to end a long, hard day of work with. Especially as it gets cold. Really enjoyable. I wish I could put it on some pancakes."
"Maybe for the style it's a bit regular? Idk... Imperial IPA's aren't something I have tons of past work with. Just seemed over-exaggerated on most accounts except, ironically, the hops; like I have a feeling that more bitterness would actually improve upon the syrupy sweetness that it has. Also, I hate to be a pussy, but... too much gd alcohol! If this was 12-14% it'd probably be much much more drinkable and, consequently, enjoyable for me. Dogfish Head makes stunning beer, and this is no exception... It's just that """stunning""" doesn't always mean """great""". I wish I could give it higher marks, but it almost disappointed me in a way, just cause of the f'ing strength."
"Overall: The mouthfeel is sticky, syrupy and thick. The body of the beer is thick and finish is medium. This beer is a sheer disappointment. I have never had a DFH that was this bad. It don't taste like a DIPA. I am so sad to rate this beer this way."
"The bottom line: Despite the fact that is part of the XXX Minute line, this is a beer that is recommended, first, for people who are used to pretty high gravity alcohol (whiskey fans would likely find some things to like here) and second for people who can appreciate beers that don't have all that much of a hop presence. I don't doubt that DFH threw a lot of hops into the kettle, but the sheer amount of malts present here drown most of them out. As a malt fan, I like this, but don't buy expecting a hop bomb...for that you're much better off going with something like a Founder's Devil Dancer or the like."
"Overall this beer was probably one of the best IPAs I have had thus far. I still have one bottle left I plan on aging, which I can expect to be even better than the one we had drank that day! I've never been disappointed by DFH. Raison D'Xtra will still be top on my list from their selection, but this is an excellent second!"
"It was worth trying but other than possibly giving a fresh bottle a try I won't be seeking this out anymore. Double Bastard is a similar kind of beer but actually tastes good."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, syrupy and sticky. But it goes well and I have to give the brewery kudos for being able to deliver such a beast that is still drinkable. Overall not a bad beer.. and I might even prefer it to the 90 min IPA.. especially now that my throat feels better!"
"Interesting IPA without an overpowering hops flavor. Subtle sweet flavor to the beer and because of the high alcohol content very warming. However I would say it hides the alcohol very well in that the alcohol taste is not overwhelming. Like others have said it is a sipping beer that will hit fast compared to most beers. Very smooth and flavorful and overall I very much recommend it."
"Overall, great beer. Amazing concoction. This is a good one to share with a group of friends."
"didn't age well although it was aged properly, i've heard the bottles are hit or miss but the tap is delicious. maybe next time."
"Excellent beer, however, at 20+% ABV, not for the faint of heart. Wonderful flavor, excellent feel. I typically buy this beer for special occasions, buying 2 - 3 bottles to share with a couple of friends who enjoy beer as much as I do. Last time bought was last week in Providence, RI - where I now live, took it down to Thomaston, GA, where I am from, and shared two bottles a piece with my brother, excellent time!"
"D - The drinkability of this beer is low, I can't see how this beer has a big following"
"D: This is definitely a sipper, to be enjoyed as you would enjoy a brandy or similar wine-type drink. Similar to a good Port or cognac."
"The brew is very smooth, sweet and has a huge alcohol warming effect and taste. A sipper indeed, this is a nice one to try. Very happy that I did. Drinks very much like a brandy or scotch - sit and enjoy."
"I love this company and their daring in various beer types. This particular type is a love it or leave it."
"Final Notes: A very impressive beer, and one that should be taken very seriously. although it is the strongest imperial IPA in the world it's sweetness is very high. the holy grail for hop heads"
"Overdone. Too full of booze, and too straight up with its roar of dominant power. If you're after insanity, maybe this is the beer for you. For me, while it is in all respects unique, it's so far beyond the realms of decency, and so confrontingly undrinkable. Maybe it mellows with age. Maybe we'll see. Right now, I can't abide it, even if I can respect it."
"For being such an alcohlic brew it's really masked well. The sugary aspect really helps with this. Still when i drink 120, it doesn't remind me of a big IPA, more booze and barley wine feel to it"
"If you like IPAs, this is a beer for you, if only to taste what something with this much hops really can taste like. My heat is off to DFH for making such a consistently excellent beer that is very complex. I hope to have many more in the future."
"After having the 90 Minute last week on draft, I was really surprised at the difference in the 120. This tasted much more like a barleywine to me as opposed to an IPA. Next time I have this I'll need to split it with a friend...maybe for dessert!"
"Damn 20% later and I'm feeling great! On tap at Sierra last november. Dark syrup heavy nose like your gonna have a cordial. The hops are crazy in this one, its a one time thing that if DFH made once a year I'd be happy with it. Tons of hop and flavor plus a great balance make this worthy of aging a long time."
"Deep orange with bubbly white head. Aroma of citrus, candied apples, pears, bubblegum. Citrus, apples, bubblegum, booze, slight hop echoes. Amazingly smooth and enjoyable. Syrupy mouthfeel and light carbonation. It's amazing what aging can do! The alcohol is tamed by tasty malt and becomes rather drinkable and enjoyable."
"D-Outstanding! But, the ABV will keep this one down to a snifter or two at best. If I wasn't told this was 120 Minute I don't think I would have believed it. So bright and fresh....tasty for sure!"
"D-I don't know what to say, I couldn't drink more than one, one is actually almost too much. This beer has so much alcohol, big hop taste; but it almost overpowers you. Definitely worth trying, I will age one or two for a few years to see how it mellows; but I wouldn't drink another of a fresh batch. Not that it is bad, definitely one to drink, it is an experience. One is enought."
"Not the best review from me...but still a huge fan of the Dogfish Head Brewery!!"
"A must try....just splurge one night, spend the ten bucks and experience this monster of a beer."
"Drinkability- Scary drinkable consider what this bad boy brings to the table, a sippers definition should be to try a 120 min, such a unique beer that I recommend every beer lover try it at least once even if you wind up thinking its to much for you, I found this to be thouroughly enjoyable and will definitely try again"
"Pours a clear golden amber color. Bold nose of citus and very earthy, spiced hops. Thin white head quick to dissolve. Smelling very sweet malt. Quite a bit of lace initially brought on by the head. Malt/sweet monster of a beer. Huge alcohol astringency and punch. Feel is very syrup-like. Warming finish. You can taste the carmalization of the sugar in this beer as well as smell it through the hops. The spice of the hops is very enjoyable in a very earthy way, not the usual hop bomb grapefruit attack of citrus. Much more sweet than I expected and the hops are not playing the bitterness roll that I thought they would. Very enjoyable. Can't wait to have my next one of these."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"But I will drink it again, but only with other people after a hefty meal. I think you need at least 3 people for one bottle do drink as a digestive."
"Notes: Well there you have it. One of the most infamous beers out there. I applaud Sam and everyone at DFH for being so extreme. Everyone should try this one at least once."
"horrible, horrible beer. smells like really good nail polish remover. imo it's not hoppy. it's extremely floral. lots of cascade used i guess. anyway i'm pissed off by the fact i just paid 6 bucks for this disaster of a beer, and ended up pouring most of it down the sink. i am going to stick with the 60 and 90 which are complete opposites of this beer."
"I never pour drinks down the sink unless it's a ruined batch - whether it be beer, wine, or a cocktail. I poured the last half of this down the sink. First, in the hopes of salvaging this beer, I experimented with a plethora of ways of drinking this. First, I warmed the beer in my hands, then I chilled it again in the glass, then poured a bit into another glass and added carbonated water to thin it out and see what flavors remained. I also returned some to the bottle and shook it gently to get more of a flavor release. None of these things brought out any balancing characteristics, but revealed to me that I'm just not a fan of a beer that has been hopped for 120 minutes."
"This beer is expensive and worth every penny!"
"Overall I find this beer to be a great example of extreme brewing at its best. Certainly not a beer to be enjoyed frequently, but certainly one that needs to be experienced at least once. Highly recommended."
"This is a well-made beer, and I certainly enjoy haivng one every now and then, but more a treat than a beer staple."
"D: You know, I'd like to see how this would have turned out if DFH had followed the logical progression and made this 12% ABV. As it is, it's probably the biggest beer the average beer geek will have access to. But don't be afraid. As long as you treat it with respect, it's a gentle giant. It certainly carries its weight more gracefully then WWS. It may not be a very good IPA, but it's an excellent after-dinner beer."
"This beer finishes bone dry with flavors revealing themselves along the way. Amazing beverage, but 12 ounces is a bit much. I would have rather enjoyed it in an 8-ounce snifter. This is truly a beer that should be experienced by any IPA or hophead enthusiast."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and complex. Drinkability is very good considerin its abv."
"Beer is very sweet and has a lot of bitterness at the back end. The sweetness is a mixture of alcohol / solvency and malt character. It is very interesting and the hop bitterness is well balanced. This is NOTHING like the 90 minute IPA. Let us be clear, they are different beasts. It is not as thin as I thought it would be and the mouthfeel is really great. This beer is surprisingly (dangerously) easy to drink. Drinkability very high. A well crafted fine DIPA, more like a QIPA. Overall a good drink, this is probably the third or forth time I've had it, still a good drink."
"I'm rating this against the fresher of the two, as I think it's better and a fairer thing to do. I rated the drinkablity of this one a four point five, not that I would ever session this monster, but it goes down amazingly easy considering it's abv."
"Dare I say, the best IIPA I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in. Big ups to Kevin's dad for bringing this to me from MD."
"What a beverage. That is all I have to say about that."
"No way I could drink this all night but this bottle went down like a dream and I had no problems finishing it at all ... more please, but maybe not tonight :o)"
"Very thick almost syrup like. Its quite balanced the sweetness/hops/alcohol wow!"
"Overall - A very unique beer, and definitely something I think every beer fan should try at least once, even if you're not a fan of traditional pale ales or IPA's."
"D - Man, good for what it is. Hard to maintain, though."
"Extreme."
"This one is obviously well-crafted; while some may have difficulty with the extremity of the sweetness, the complexity and balance in this one can't be denied, and it feels great. While this one's very good, drinkability's much lower than the quality might typically account for due to the extremely high alcohol content and the sweetness that forces this one to be a sipper. I'd certainly drink more than one in a sitting, but it might knock me out."
"Overall the major sweetness and booziness was a hindrance in my enjoyment and my ability to call this a """world class""" beer. Definitely happy I tried it though."
"I was excited to try this beer as the availability is very limited. I was expecting more of a head upon the pour but that's not very important to me. The aroma is complex and gives hints of cinnamon, raisins, and carmel. Upon initial taste I was surprised that a slight sweetness presented itself. Overall it's a medium body beer with plenty of character that changes sip after sip. Has a long finish that's not bitter which is surprising for a 120 minute IPA. Can only have 1 or 2 in a sitting as the ABV is very high. Cheers"
"Drinkability: Maybe palatable in a shot glass..."
"This problem doesn't seem to affect the taste or aroma, though, and I've always been impressed with Dogfish's ability to make this beer. True, it has tons of alcohol sweetness but that is balanced by almost unfathomable proportions of hop flavor and aroma. I'm constantly amazed that a beer this strong can still resemble beer."
"Overall: Impressive beer. Certainly not for the faint of heart. Worth trying, but forget having a few of this beer on the same evening. Very loading. Very challenging. Very DFH! Will age very well for MANY years."
"I don't want to drink a bomber of this in an evening, but this is a well put together beer and I'm glad I tried it. I can't say it will end up in my crate very often given the price tag, but I will mostly certainly pick this up again and keep it for a rainy (or quite special) day. I'm not a huge DFH fan, but hats off to Sam for this one."
"D - Not what I expected, cant say this is very drinkable. Very strong and harsh. I kind of developed a palette for it by the end. Different but not my normal cup of tea."
"Try it if you must, there isn't anything else out there like it, but its such a stretch of any preconceived boundary that I could not enjoy it."
"drinkability I found is very low. Too much of an alcohol taste. Doesnt go down easy."
"Drinkability - due to the high alcohol content and the unusual flavors I'd say that this is a beer to enjoy if you like cognacs. This beer reminded me more of a cognac, which is something you sit back and savor. I view it as a good experience and worth drinking, but not something that I would go out of my way for."
"Well, had to try it but don't think I'll buy it again."
"Mouthfeel: Very faint carbonation delivers a sweet, sticky, hop solution that actually rolls down easily but leaves enough bitterness behind that elicits a slight pucker. As it warms the sweetness comes to the front with a boozy edge that gets a little hot. A froth on the palate keeps it about the same. Definitely worth trying and I am glad that the hops lean towards the citrus and pine profiles. I was expecting more of a hop burn but I was pleasantly surprised. This has been on my radar to try for years. Very worthy!"
"I was quite surprise having been unimpressed with my prior expience with the 120. A very brandied nose and palate. I expected the hops to be over powering but this beer had incredible balance. The beer was exceptional though I don't know that I could drink a whole bottle."
"M-D: This is a beer that is for heavy beer drinkers. Once the beer is in your mouth, you are experiencing Dogfish head's 20% alcohol content. Very strong at the start and very strong to the finish. Wonderful IPA!"
"Heedless of Aristotle, this is an extreme beer at its most extreme. I'd long wanted to sample this brew, but its cloyingly sweet, leathery smell nearly changed my mind. The taste was better. Still too sweet, but not unpleasant. It tasted like molasses filtered through crushed flowers. It was not IPA-like. Not even beer-like. (It has a nice, amber color, but a scant head.) Though I haven't tasted Southern Comfort in decades, it reminded me of that. It's drinkable, and it masks its alcohol content quite well until the dwindling aftertaste. This beer lives in the twilight zone between the beer/wine abv's and the hard liquor abv's. Not many beverages go there, and none are as popular as their weaker and stronger cousins. I can't fault Dogfish for venturing into this realm. But, really, could this be anyone's favorite beer or even their drink of choice?"
"(D)- Just ridiculous, massive, and potent on every level imaginable. Great stuff, but is lost in the overly boozy mouthfeel. Give this 5 years and try it again, give it 10 years and try it again. I want to buy a bunch and drink one as each year goes by to see how it changes. Share with a friend or two cause this one bottle kicked me to the floor. 20%abv?!"
"D- Overall, this is definitely one of the most interesting brews that I have had. Way too sweet to be considered an IPA by me, but it certainly wasn't a bad brew. In fact I enjoyed it quite a bit. The alcohol, even though it is rather apparent, is exceptionally well hidden considering how strong it is. Certainly worth trying."
"Anybody who's had a colonoscopy knows how hard it is to drink the prep. You hold your nose and do anything possible to distract yourself from the thick sickenly sweet, perfumely, pungent, syrup that's about to enter your body. I find myself doing the same with this brew. The sweetness is too much to take. The smell is not pleasant, and the mouth feel, combined with the above conspires to make the whole experience unpleasant. I tried really hard to finish the bottle, but alas, it's down the drain."
"One of the legendary beers. Poured a very cloudy amber/brown with a tiny head that became embarrassed, and shrank to nothing, immediately. The aroma was ripe, dark fruits, and sweet alcohol. The taste was boozy, malty sweet, I didn't find the highly vaunted, super hop presence here. Feel is full bodied with light carbonation. The drinkability is fair to middling. Overall, this appears to be one of those love it or hate it beer, with me firmly ensconced in the middle. 120 Minute was tasty, and I know production costs must be high, but not worth the price. Although, ya gotta have just one in your lifetime."
"I can't believe I am saying this but it is relatively drinkable. I mean, it's not something to have two of, but it is great for sipping."
"D: Not the most drinkable beer by the standard measure, but not bad for what it is - a very high abv extreme beer."
"Living in Georgia, I always heard about it. Moving to new york i finally get to try it out. It was so strange that i tried it two nights in a row. it's like someone dumped turpentine into my brownies. smells great, looks good. tastes bad. big disappointment again from dogfish."
"This is not a recreational beer. It is meant for beer """sipping""". It pours with a sweet aroma and little head. It is a deep amber color and totally opaque. If you are a true IPA fan you will probably not enjoy the experience since what hoppiness it has is overpowered by the strength of the alcohol content. It will definitely make you feel good, but there are more satisfying ways to make that happen. NOT FOR IPA LOVERS!!"
"taste is crazy, obviously very strong, more like a desert wine han a beer. No hop to it at all, which is a bit sad because the alcohol covers it all up and just dominates. it's very sweet and syrupy. Drinkability is so low because it's so strong. One is plenty. I split mine with a friend. You should do the same."
"Good interesting beer, with surprising finesse."
"Overall, it's not really what you'd expect for the style, but I wouldn't disregard anything that is pushing the envelope."
"Notes: These eccentricity is a total favorite. Great as the final warming sipper after a meal or the final note for a group beer tasting dinner. I think a common misconception is that this is going to be a heavy DIPA very hoppy and bitter, whereas so many hops and malts make it very sweet, boozy and complex taking it to another range of flavors."
"Overall this is one bad motherfucker, I would recommend a half bottle for yourself, and the other half to share. Its a slow sipper with just enough hops on the palate to make it worthwhile. Just pure intensity."
"Will knock you on your ass. One of the sweetest yet highest alcohol content beers I've ever had. I don't like their 60 or 90 minute IPAs, but this is a beer to be respected. It goes down way too smooth to be so strong. I imagine a hangover from this will make you want to give up beer though."
"Notes: Wow, I think the thing to expect with this beer is not beer but instead, make sure you think of this as a mixed drink in a bottle. It's ok, nothing I'd recommend more than once for the experience."
"D: 21% ABV means that this is a one and done affair and should be paired with food. I like this one, but the 90 is better balanced for my taste."
"That said, this is a hard one to rate. My rating came out a B+, but I enjoyed this much more than other beers I've rated higher. Tasty stuff."
"More of an experience than just a beer. Try it at least once. If you like this sort of thing, you know who you are, and you will be back for more."
"D: As much as I'd like to be a tough guy on the subject, this beer is not very drinkable. I'm glad to say that I've tried it, but I don't think I will have it again any time soon."
" Overall not a good beer for it's classification but a well designed beer and extremely unique. a good one to share with your buddies. Not gonna be a regular pick up for me."
" desireable aged brew."
"Does it want to be loved or feared? I think feared."
"You should try the 120, simply because there's nothing quite like it. But, this does not make it great beer. I'm not even sure this is beer."
"I had a friend once take it out of my fridge. He saw """pale ale""" and didn't know much about beer. He was very surprised when he took a big gulp from the bottle."
"The ABV make the drinkability lower than alot of IIPAs. Very odd beer; a little too extreme for me."
"D- this beast is definitely a sipper. took me an hour to finish. everyone should try at least once for the experience. couldn't get paste the sugary sweet taste...kind of like those orange cough medicines I used to take as a kid."
"Wasn't sure what to expect with the high alcohol content, but wasn't impressed by the beer. It had good color and a good smell, but it tasted like liquid brown sugar. Surprisingly it wasn't an overpowering alcohol flavor I expected, though you felt it in the back of the throat after having one."
"D: Everyone should try this once, but thats about it. I'm still cringing at the thought of another full bottle... way to sweet. Took over an hour to finnish 12oz. The absurdley high ABV is hidden to some extent by the sweetness."
"Such a unique and excellent beer. Love it or hate it, this is just something that needs to be tried at least once. Personally, I love it."
"Overall- an interesting brew, but definitely not an everyday kind of beer."
"D - No no no... definately a sipper. Can't drink this fast. You feel the alcohol before you get halfway through."
"Drinkability was not that great but given the alcohol content, I have to give it ok."
"Drinkability- I was glad I split this with the GF. This really feels like an appartief."
"Drinkability - Its a big brew that is wonderful when sipped I cant imagine drinking more than one of these. Overall I am very happy I spent the 9$ on this bottle."
"D: Considering the abv it really isn't too hard to drink. Can't say I'll have more than one bottle in one sitting though, haha. I'll definitely buy this again."
"D- Real boozy, sticky and sweet, makes this one a sipper Ill probably not try again."
"D) I mean, what can you say here. I hurt all over. It beats you up a little. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't easy killing all 12 oz."
"Pours a nice and clear burnt golden orange, the last little bit of the pour provides a nice cloud of haze that falls through, and then clears up nicely. The head is moderate, but I mean, it's got to be hard to carbonate a beer this high in alcohol, leaves minimal lacing. But it actually looks nice. The smell is primarily peachy alcohol, some raw sugary smells, a bit of raisins and dates, a tiny bit of esters, maybe some tart cherries, a tiny bit of spice, and a sweet, syrupy maltiness. The taste is kind of interesting, like bread pudding, maybe french toast, soaked in rum, with raisins, dates, plums, cherries, etc., just like a syrupy, sweet, kind of malty, bready burst. Just huge on flavor, a bit of esters, some light tart cherry hoppiness, nice, but not as much hoppiness as you would expect from 120 minutes of hopping and 30 days of dry hopping. But the alcohol rules this one for the most part. Not my favorite thing in beer, but actually, for the ABV, this one seems like much less than it actually is. And surprising, a lot less syrupy than even some other DFH beers. It actually does a nice job finding the balance between dry and sweet. Very good. Light carbonation, and any burn provided is upstaged by alcohol burn. The drinkability, well it speaks for itself. It took me well over half and hour to finish 4-5 oz, and I can say that the last 5 or 6 sips will probably take me another 10-15 minutes. Very slow drinking. But overall, an interesting beer, though for the amount of stuff that goes into it, it has a few less dimensions that I would expect. Not an everyday drink, maybe not even possibly a once a year thing for me. But it's worth the experience I'd say."
"Eric"
"I gave this beer an A because due to its high level of craft and the fact that Dogfish was able to pull it off. Just because its an A don't run out and buy it thinking it will be excellent. This is an experience not a session."
"This beer pours a clear red-orange color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch of lacing. Due to the extremely high alcohol content I was expecting the head to be minimal at best, and am very pleasantly surprised. The aroma is very hoppy with lots of pine and citrus. There is a lot of malt too, but it is soft and easily takes a back seat to the hops. The alcohol is present in the terms of adding a slight cough syrup note. It is, however, a lot more subdued than I expected, and I like that. The taste has a bite...wow. There is more malt here with an almost mead like honey character. The citrus, and pine from the aroma are present, but the malt masks the bitterness which I'm sure is in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very interesting beer, and huge kudos go out to DFH for dreaming it up. I certainly couldn't drink this every day, or even every month. But I'm could picture myself sipping this down two or three times a year, and thoroughly enjoying it."
"Conclusion: GOOD to try this a coupla of times for the experience...this would be great for an aperitif or digestif...milder than I thought it'd be, quite honestly...had at near room temperature"
"I like a more balanced offering, but this is a well-crafted beer of high quality and I wish I had the ability to keep it for a couple years before imbibing. Alas, nothing in the house ever lasts that long."
"smells like warm floral hops. has some citrus, pine, and some spice. Taste is alot better then i expected. I thought this was going to be like eating straight hops. it was actually more floral sweet then hoppy bitter. you can taste the alcohol in the after taste. It is an amazing beer. I'd rather drink one of these then a six pack of something else, and its just as alcoholic! full bodied beer. wish i can get them a bit cheaper."
"D - Like I said not horrible but it will be a chore to even get through this 12 oz bottle. If you do buy one leave it in a closet for like years. It might mature into something else. Then again maybe not. A unique brew for sure but don't know if I will ever get another one. 90 minute and 60 minutes are pretty good drinkable IPAs. This is something else entirely. Enter at your own risk."
"Not a beer to be taken lightly..This is a sipper for sure. I'm not sure I'd really have this again even if it were less expensive. The 90min is the way to go for me."
"Interesting brew, sip slow and enjoy. Could not drink more than one and not too often."
"Heavy/Thick body, rich and it took me about 90 minutes to finish, very much a sippin' beer."
"D: Given how alcoholic it is, it drinks surprisingly well. Unfortunately given the price you can't drink often."
"I am having a hard time splitting a 12 oz. drinkability poor."
"Enjoy"
"Got this in a trade with Soulfly967 in Pennsylvania. Aroma is strong, hoppy, and surprisingly fruity - the orange and hop aromas battle for dominance, so one whiff is hoppy while the next is of orange. It pours a hazy orange-amber with a fairly thick and rather persistent white head. Flavor is richly orange and a little sweet with a firm hoppy but only slightly bitter hop undertone. This is quite unlike any IPA I have ever had - well worth the effort of setting up a trade! Texture is rich and silky smooth, yet fairly tingly and lively."
"After several years since first having this, I had to update.  The nose is full of incredible hop cone goodness.  Huge citrus and fruity hops.  The taste is like a Hopslam on steroids.  It has the honey sweetness like said beer with huge hop presence that lacks strong bitterness.  Their is a strong phenolic alcohol presence that could use some age to mellow it, but hey, this is 18%.  Overall, a great beer that I thoroughly enjoy."
"all around, a good. beats the hell out of 90 minute and 60 minute."
"J"
"Bottle I am rerating this one. It is one of my favorite beers. Pours a hazy copper orange with a deminishing light tan head. The lacing is great. The aroma is great pine, alcohol, caramel, and earthy. Has a great carbonation. Mouthfeel is excellent. The alcohol burn is very mild considering the %. Has good flavor. Not too bitter but well hopped. The balance is great. Has a resinlike texture. The finish is awesome with a perfect aftertaste. This beer is still the mecca."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Out of this world! I highly recommend!"
"Overall, this was quite the sipper. Glad I shared it with Russ. I don't know if I could have a lot of this. Not to bad for the abv, but definitely a beer to drink in moderation."
"D - The ultimate sipper... DFH is known for their extreme beers, and this is the poster child... This beer could last you hours... Some may consider this a """gimmick""" beer, but they would sorely be missing the point... This is a unique and intriguing offering that all BAs should experience for themselves at somepoint... Truly one of a kind..."
"Drinkability- Not much to say, here. It's a rare occasion when I buy these, and for a good reason. Never will I drink more than one in a session. Let alone, a good three months."
"Poured into snifter, a deep amber color, clear, with thick light tan head. Great retention and lacing. A very good looking beer. Smell is intense of piney hops, citrus, sweetness, and alcohol. It almost smells like some sort of sweet, hard candy. Taste is similar. Strong, sweet, intense malt. Some caramel, candi sugar, and just general sweetness. A little bit of pineapple and/or general citric hops as it hits the back of the palate. Alcohol and a very warming/burning sensation as it goes down. Thick and creamy mouthfeel that I really enjoyed, somewhat velvety. Overall a drinkable beer in the sense that it is possible to drink this and enjoy it. Not drinkable in the sense of, """lets get a 6'er and slam it.""" This beer is intense and I think if you can drink this in less than 2 hours then you need to drink less."
"Notes: Better than Old Schoole in terms of alcohol masking and balance. I really do not see how aging would help this,but I do not know for sure. It just was not what I thought of as a great beer. I will not buy this again,but it is worth a try."
"Unique and interesting but not your everyday beer."
"Moderate head, sinks down to a thin layer across the surface, the lacing very sticky, thicker than mere streaks. Equally thick, cloudy orange haze to the liquid, more yellow gold around the rims. Heavy nose of glazed apricots, peaches and pineapple, this even beats down the sweet pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus, finds room for pine sap and a light dusting of cocoa too, smells like a """dessert""" beer. Full-bodied, spicy, hot and boozy entering the mouth. Tiny fizz for carbonation, nowhere what's needed to cut through the abundant flesh of the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, mango fruit. Oodles of pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime pulp. Shovels in molasses, honey and pine sap, relentlessly homogeneous and exaggerated. Not a lot more to be additionally said after the first few sips."
"As for drinkability... Ummm... No? That's what I have for that answeram I don't know if there is a zero rating or not, but I hope there is so that I can justify using it. For me, this is a novelty. Try one and trade the rest of your stash."
"Over all grade is an A. The only downside is the price. It's really hard to justify spending $8 per beer on a regular basis, and it doesn't matter how good the beer is, that's just too much money. But for all beer lovers out there it's totally worth a try, you won't be disappointed."
"D - At 21% ABV, this is the epitome of a slow sipper. At $8.99 per 12 oz. bottle it is pretty hard on the wallet for most, including me, but I'm glad I gave it a try. A unique summertime nightcap."
"I like 'extreme' beers, but this falls into the class of big guns/big tits/big explosion American-style overkill that ruins what might have been a good thing. Nuance? Forget it."
"For those who dare to have another bottle of this, you sir just want to get drunk. For the taste and high alcohol and price tag, I will never, I repeat never drink this stuff again. I will stick to 60 and 90 minute IPA for sure."
"D: Goes down really well, but it IS really sugary. Not cloying, just feels like you're drinking dessert. That's the only thing stopping me from pounding this thing. Good for a dessert beer, but not to be served with a meal."
"A gimmicky beer that is good to try once or twice but not the best IPA by far. I think it is a show of what can be done if all the stops are taken out in the brewing process and someone is allowed to go nuts. The sweetness, ABV and the price tag make it too far out of the ordinary though to get used to."
"Drinks incredibly well for being wine strength, there is a noticeable alcohol bite, but this beer is an impressive feat."
"D - It killed the taste buds pretty quick."
"Poured a murky dark amber with a smallish head. Aroma of hops and alcohol. Accents of booze, hops, and cough syrup. Mouthfeel likewise similar to syrup. Drank it slow and tried to think of it not as a normal beer, but this did not help. Way too sweet and viscous for my taste. A shame, as I was really looking forward to trying this beer. My dropping $12 on a 12oz is testament to that. A big disappointment all around."
"It smells boozy, some vinegar, some sweetness. The taste is carbonated, molasses, sugar, hops, very thick. Mouthfeel seems to be a combination of a strong barleywine and a DIPA with an extra couple punches. This beer is serious, as you could easily see just be looking at the ABV. Drinkability was fine for one of these. I was glad that I finally had one, a very unique and good beer."
"Shared this earlier tonight with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. From all the reviews I'd read I was expecting something not quite my taste. Poured a beautiful golden/orange beer with very little head. Smelled of hops, alcohol, honey, and fruit. Tasted wonderful, almost like a cross between beer and port. Mouthfeel was exceptional, going down incredibly smooth with just enough carbonation. Incredibly enough, I drank my half pretty quickly and found myself wanting another, though had I had a whole one to myself it may have been a different story."
"I'm under the impression at this point that my review is unfair as I believe I got an outdated bottle. There is an overwhelming taste of vinegar in this beer inducing gag reflex in every sip. I simply can't finish this beer. Again, I may have gotten a bad bottle."
"D: This is one stellar brew, meant only to be sipped. At $10 a bottle, this was completely worth it."
"A very interesting beer. If I didn't dislike the aroma so much, I think I really would have liked it. Maybe next time I'll leave it in the bottle ;)"
"Sam Calagione is the devil. I mean that in a good way. I could see this beer being even better with some age because it sure kicked me in my ass, and I'd love to try it again after it mellows out a bit."
"D - Not my favorite. Its a nice experiment to have once but I prefer other IIPA's"
"Final thoughts: I buy 4-6 of these a year. Good for a special occasion, but more than 1 of these a month and you'll overdo it. Still, these store every well, I have put a couple in storage and have been satisfied with how well they sit. Dogfish hits the bullseye with this beer and show again how they are on the forefront of brewing. An extreme extreme beer on steroids, this beer is not for the weak. I suggest you develop a taste for some of the higher DIPAs before you try and crack this one."
"This beer is its own beast, Search it out and drink it just because it is what it is. 21% hardcore fun. While on a beer scale it is not number one, it should at leat be tried once!!"
"Yeah, it's good, but I'm surprised that it's not even better. Maybe, I just fell victim to the hype or I'm making untoward comparisons, but at 21% abv, this beer should be better. I'm not slamming 120 min. I thoroughly enjoyed my bottle. It was delicious and probably a testament to the skill of the brewery that the alcohol is felt so little. However, at 10% abv higher than the best DIPA in the world (Pliny the Younger, in my experience), I was expecting some sort of extreme flavor or something otherwise outlandish. The mouthfeel isn't even as thick as many a much lower proof barleywine. At any rate, the beer is a fairly thick golden liquid with a good head. The hops dominate with a citric-orange flavor, but the malt isn't terribly far behind with an excellent caramel sweetness. The beer is fairly sweet but, shockingly, never cloyingly so. I may not understand Sam Calagione and co., but they are very, very skilled brewers. This beer was very good, just not at all what I was expecting."
"little carbonation and syrupy body. Not my type of beer, but def wow factor."
"Just opened a beer from June 2009 and wow does this bad boy ever age well! The alcohol is very well hidden, alot of the same flavours come through, but highly drinkable and delicious. I recommend aging this!"
"Pours a dark deep copper/orange hue. Lots of head and lots of lacing. Simply looks super thick, sticky and syrupy. Piney, grassy, and grapefruity... all the hop culprits. Slight honey sweetness with an alcohol twinge. Basically a hug hop bomb followed by a HUGE alcohol burn. My tongue is immediately covered by the citrus hops. I'd like to thin we could handicap 20% beers but this thing is a sipper if ther ever was one! it took me 2.5 hrs to finish a 12oz'r"
"smells and tastes very sweet (almost too sweet) and very alcoholly. very syrupy and a sipper only. I had to try this due to the hype but honestly it's not worth it. I love beer and can drink a lot but I can't drink much of this 12oz bottle and will toss the 2nd half. I can't finish this and will have something else instead."
"Drinkability= dangerously drinkable for a >20% ABV beer- though the cognac-esque nature of the beer begs you to sip and enjoy slowly! increases in aroma and flavor as it warms. do yourself a favor with this one- take your time and soak it all in...Cheers!"
"i read the bottle it claims to be the """holy grail for hop heads""" all i tasted in this beer was SWEET and BOOZE a little hop after taste but i was truly unimpressed with this beer i really had to struggle to finish it and thats hard for me to do"
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a white head that fades to a persistant film. Smells like super sticky hops, very piny and sweet grapefruity. The taste has two aspects, sweetness and bitterness. It is dominated by the sweetness. I can't taste a single hint of alcohol which is surprising. Mouthfeel is great, very syrupy and smooth. Drinkability is huge."
"D. For 21% I have to say that its pretty drinkable. It is a sipper for sure. Might be a little too boozey for it to be a regular drinker for me. You can not deny the fact that this is a unique and interesting beer."
"I've had this out of the bottle before and never bothered to review it because it would have been a rip-fest. I hated it. Just had a chance to try it on tap though, and it is a completely different experience. The appearance was a bit bland but after that it got good in a hurry. Great smelling brew, like cutting open a apricot and taking a whiff. The taste was very sweet, but not too overbearing and there were plenty of complexities that wafted in and out of your perception. At 21%, obviously you aren't drinking a lot of these, but I enjoyed my 8 oz pour very much. Really impressive. Reminds me of Behemoth from 3f's, not in taste, but in how much better it is on tap as compared to out of the bottle."
"My first 120. Was really excited to give this a shot. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into goblet. A beautiful cloudy honey-caramel appearance with a tiny ring of head around the edges. I simply don't have the vocabulary to describe the smell. Very sweet, totally smell the alcohol, but really, really distinct. Very faint hops smell, but then the sweet alcohol fumes take over. The taste is a complex mix of mostly sweet alcohol - brown sugar and molasses - but then there is a surprisingly subtle underlying hop bitterness that holds it together and really keeps things interesting. The hops come through more as the beer warms. Medium body with very little carbonation and a nice oiliness. I would like to see what happens when drinking three of these things in a couple of hours or so. I only had one and it definitely made its presence known. I look forward to sharing this with friends; would probably be incredible with a smoked cheese or good moldy gorgonzola."
"Pours a syrupy, murky, orange color with minimal head. Smells of pine, oak, citrus, caramel, very sweet smelling...tons of things going on. Taste follows extremely sweet. Not bitter at all, just very very very sweet. Its definitely a sipper. I drank half and had to mix the other half with other beers in a span of 4 hours or so."
"overall - I'm probably going to go out next week and buy me a few more of these, and see just how well they age. This is one of the champions of the strong beer realm, and you'd do well to respect its power."
"As much as this is a sipper, the mouthfeel isn't as big as you'd think. It feels great and goes down just the same. This is a beer to make sweeeet love to (it'll treat you well in return, I swear to god)"
"As the beer warmed a bit it still enticed you to drink it up even though it was as strong tasting as it was sweet. Kinda neat."
"Re-tasted: 18% abv. This is 1 of 21 DFH beers tasted 6/13/09 in Los Angeles. Simply put, this is liquid lemon mirangue pie! This beer is huge and extreme in every respect. You either love it or hate. Huge lemon/lemon mousse nose. Medium/light carbonation. Big, full rich mouthfeel of creamy lemon and malt with orange and spice characteristics. Big sweet rich lemon and malt flavors and a thick almost lemon syrup finish. A beer for extreme flavors in foods, amost any dessert or just to sip. A treat! Drink or age."
"bottom line, another quality, bold, aggressive beer from DFH"
"Full-bodied ale mouthfeel, not watery, but not heavy in any way. I could drink a lot of these but I'd fall off my stool after two."
"Very glad I tried this. If this were available in my area, I'd buy for special occasions as a novelty for people to try."
"At the very least, you have to concede that this is one-of-a-kind. I don't know if I see myself coming back to it, but I'm glad I tried it."
"D- Tough drink. I don't think I'm ready for this."
"Note: 5/31/09 Had 5/02/09 bottle i recommend that you keep it for at least a year before drinking. Very mild stuff at first."
"D: The funky/ sour flavor gets to me a bit, plus the abv is so high. I could only have about one of these in any given night."
"drinkability: surprisingly smooth. another weird attempt to make beer different. Again I repsect DFH and what they do but this is not a beer I want to drink all the time."
"overall i think this will be a love hate beer - and put me down on the love side even though the first one i had was sour and i think it was infected and i am glad i did not review it because it was a hate. the consistency of dfh is not that great but when they are on the are on."
"Big thanks to BeerMan-lots-of-7's for the chance to try this one! Dark amber with a brilliant white, frothy head. Just popping the bottle I can smell the citrus hoppiness. A closer investigation reveals an apricot scent with a hint of bitter hops. Time to taste... Wow- this thing is crazy! Massive hops up front. It's not that bitter up front but not very bitter. Lots of sweet citrus, no pine at all. Slightly sticky though. This is followed by a huge caramel, syrup malt then a slight bitterness followed by a slightly strange chemical taste. This aftertaste would be my only criticism. I really liked this beer and look forward to another bottle."
"D= one only, for me. I'd love to let this go flat and serve it in 4-ounce snifters and see how that works."
"Poured a beautiful glowing amber color with a very small head and no lacing. Smell was dominated by a honey sweetness, taste followed suit and was sweet but surprisingly tame. The alcohol was noticeable but not as overpowering as I would have expected. Mouthfeel was oily and medium/full bodied with limited amounts of carbonation. Drinkability suffers some due to the gigantic level of sweetness, but overall this is a nice sipping beer."
"D: Pretty good when it was relatively fresh (currently adding notes from old handwritten review). I've got a couple of these in the cellar, and I'm looking forward to popping one every July for the next few years."
"Oh my, I don't want to take away from this, because the style it is in is appropriate, but I don't know if this is for me. I'd still say it is a solid Imperial IPA"
"D- I was sitting at the review page adjusting the ratings as I was drinking. The more I drank the further the drinkability dropped. The next time I buy this I will split one with a friend. It's more economical and 1 would be the absolute maximum for one sitting. This thing kills!! But in a good way :)"
"even before the very last sip there was a nice milky way haze left behind. hardly a bitter aftertaste (for high ibu's) due to the high alcohol content which made it more a sweet honey flavor. extremely dense towards the bottom of the snifter with a slight floral flavor. the smell clears the sinuses quite nicely. after 30 minutes, a swirl of the snifter leaves a lovely, thin glaze of head behind, and continues to annihilate my palate!"
"Way too strong for me, but from my perspective this isn't really a beer. I'd say if you drink with the knowledge that you're really drinking 4 beers at once, and take ¼ the swig you'd normally take, that'll be about right."
"Incredibly drinkable for a 21% beer"
"Jordan."
"Feels kind of slick and oily in the mouth carbonation is good though. I thought for a 21% brew this was fairly drinkable. This is brew to be savored every couple of years."
"A beer that is good, but in my mind is meant to be savored on occasion."
"After giving up beer for Lent, I had to sample a big gun to celebrate being back to the world of hops. Poured a copper-orange color, white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Hoppy, fruity aroma. Taste is, well, like nothing I've ever tasted before. I can tell that it's got a good amount of hops, but it has none of the bitterness or astringency I associate with traditional hop-bombs. The fruity-citrusy flavor predominates, with a complex mouthfeel that is smooth, sweet, rich and hoppy all at the same time. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden; if I had not read this beers reviews I would never have guessed the ABV. Unfortunately it's price puts it out of range for regular consumption, but definitely something worth sampling for the true beer fan."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, quite intense. One to try, but quite a different beer than the 60 and 90 minutes. Like some one else stated, the 90 minute is just a more intense 60 minute. However, the 120 minute is a different beer altogther (whether good or bad). I will say that I may have gotten a bad beer, as this one was rather dull and lifeless."
"Overall this beer is great. In my hazy mind I thought this was just a 10% beer and I thought it hid it well, but now I see it's 21% I'm just shocked at the lack of an alcohol note. Being that it is such a high abv brew, it will kick your butt."
"An entirely different beast from the 60 and 90 minute IPAs."
"I hold this one dear in my heart and seeing it is a hard-to-get baby i'm gonna be happy to be back in NYC one day. The mystique aura it deserves will make it a sure-thing next time in the big apple."
"All in all, I would have and should have sticked with the 90 minute and will next time. But, at least I can say that I've had it."
"Pours an opaque, deep-orange with a small off-white head. I can smell the floral and citrus aromas with the beer sitting on the desk next to me. The first smell is full of bright-orange aromas coupled with a sharp alcohol bite. A light floral note sneaks through the back, screaming of some crazy-hop infusion. I can tell it's bitter, but the smell isn't really letting that lose. It's more sweet, citrusy, and floral than it is outright bitter hoppy. I know those aromas are in fact derived from the hops, but it's different than I would have expected. The first sip is significantly less intense than I expected. The citrus bite hits right up front, mostly citrus zest, with a larger emphasis placed on orange than lemon. The ABV, all 21.00% of it hits the tongue at the same time as a slightly grassy hop note, burning just a little bit on the tongue before the swallow. A pronounced burning hits the throat, but it's by no means harsh, just a general sense of warm. A mild sweetness cuts under everything, brightening the beer up just a touch. After a few more sips, the citrus flavor becomes a little sweeter, more reminiscent of a real orange than the zest. The alcohol picks up a bit as well, warming and biting harder than it did earlier. After a little warming, this thing picks up some serious power. The hops still don't carry too much of a bitter taste, but they certainly make up for it with the insane amount of floral and citrus notes that come into play. The alcohol hits the same way, strong, intense, and delightful. There's a subtlety here that is lost in other DIPAs, Southern Tier Hoppe comes to mind. Somehow, with almost twice the alcohol, it tastes less like vodka and more like a damn fine beer. Quality all around. I'm looking forward to Black and Tanning this with World Wide Stout. It should be an exercise in ludicrousness. The overall profile is a little unbalanced for my taste, but not enough so to really hurt this thing. It's over-the-top, but deliberately so. Well-done and well-rounded...at least as far as it can be."
"D: A one and done, took awhile to drink it. If you enjoy extreme beer, this is a must try, maybe I am more of a wuss, but this was a tad too extreme for me."
"Dogfish Head never ceases to amaze me. Much like my roommate who after taking a couple sips doesn't want any more. And instead of letting me finish it for him just slammed it instead. Then wants to complain 5 minutes later that he feels warm...go figure."
"mouthfeel and drinkability were right in between what you would fell drinking a regular beer and a hard liquor. very interesting."
"D: This is a tough one. First of all, at $8 for a 12oz bottle, there is going to be a limit on my drinkability before I even open the bottle. This is a sipping beer. You need some time between each sip to truly appreciate this beer. But, at times, this beer can be overwhelming and intense. And, frankly, I don't see how it can be considered an IPA; sweet with a noticeable lack of hoppiness. Compared with the 60 and 90, this beer is in a class by itself, but its not the logical procession. The 90 minute is a more intense 60 minute, but the 120 is not a more intense 90 minute. Its just a different beer all to its own."
"D - Incredibly low on the drinkability scale. This guy could be consumed once a year in my opinion. And, each time I'd share it too."
"I'm glad I tried this beer. It's very creative and worth the price to try, but it's doubtful I ever buy it again unless I have a friend that wants to try it for the first time. I actually scored this beer significantly less then went back after thinking about it for a while, mainly because you have to understand going into this that DFH is trying to create something over the top and not for the every day consumer. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it definitely takes an open mind and palate to appreciate it."
"Drinkability: The high alcohol content is definetly subdued and it is easy to drink. It has a certain sweetness that keeps you coming back for more. I would like to have more of these but at the price? I would much rather have a Trappist 8 for cheaper."
"Overall... Something definitely worth trying, or tasting, but not something I will long for tomorrow."
"Drinkability: I would probably want to drink this on special occasions, but fear what it would do to my head if I drank a 6 pack of these... Very good, but not a session beer. Definitely a sipper"
"Welp, good for a try and I'm enjoying it, but I can't really see getting any more at the high dollar 12oz bottle price."
"Taste? Well, HOPS & ALCOHOL but with a twist...gotta try it to know what I'm talking about. Not a beer I'd be drinking on a daily basis but I really enjoy it for a change of pace."
"Overall, just a tad too extreme for me"
"This brew poured to a cloudy and murky yellow to bronze color with a slight head that had no real retention. The aroma, wow ... lots of hops, very sweet, caramel. Not to bad of a smelling brew. Well now for the taste, good god, alcohol is the first thing that comes to mind and then it breaks to hop resin and such a sweet flavor that after a while it is very difficult to get down. At first I just thought it was an odd ball but after a while this one was just grossly over the top for me. I did finish it, was not going to let a $7 draft go down the drain, but it was one of if not the most difficult beers for me to finish. Clearly this was a one time endeavor for me."
"Overall: We had a lot of fun drinking this beer and enjoyed the insane bitch slap we got from the hops. However, this is a beer that should not be taken seriously. What I mean by this is that there is no way anyone should want to drink this on a regular basis. It is extreme beyond belief. I will definitely search for another one to keep as a conversation piece the next time I get together with other hop lovers, but in no way see it as one of the better IPAs out there."
"D - While this has a nice flavor, the alcohol makes it tough to drink more than one."
"Yes has big body, and is not drinkable in the least. I could not have another without going in to some kind of diabetic coma."
"D- amazingly enough, this wasnt as hard to finish as i thought. i certainly wouldnt attempt another one right now, or anytime soon, but for 21% its alot easier to finish that i would have thought. i feel the hoppiness of this one to be embellished, and im not sure why everyone loves it like they do. it seems more of a novelty to me than anything else."
"Light hop finish. One for the ages."
"Yes, I conquored it. Will I drink it again? Only if I have the whole night to dedicate to it!"
"I could drink a bottle of this without much problems, pretty good drinkings for such a big brew. I love DFH"
"D: Definitely a BIG beer! Would have to say it's not a very drinkable brew, but who would expect anything else but a nice sipper at 21% ABV! Reminds me of a nice port, only 4-6oz. is really necessary, 12oz. is a little too much."
"D - This is not what I expected. That's not to say that I didn't like it, it's just weird... and although almost all of my top rated brews are high ABV, anything much over 12% is just a little ridiculous and begins to detract from the flavor. I ride a Yamaha Vino 125 scooter, and what makes a scooter a scooter is it's small size, low cost, and small but peppy engine. Some of those big Suzuki Burgman and Honda Silverwing scooters are 650ccs and cost close to 10 grand... then, what's the point? Why not just buy a motorcycle? If you want to pay upwards of $10 for 12 oz of something boozy, why not just pick up a good single malt or a good upscale bourbon? I understand that this is not distilled, but there comes a point when beer really isn't beer any more. Just like scooters are all about low cost, small size, and around town fun, beer is supposed to be all about fluffy heads spilling over liter sized mugs. Just ask any German."
"Not an easy drinker by my opinion.The Flavor is not bright enough to blend with the strong alcohol taste.Still made for good times.I'll probably get it again."
"Still totally overpowered by the alcohol. It's probably better than I rated it """overall""" last time, but I think this is more of a novelty beer than anything else. Well crafted, but gimmicky. Alcoholic to the point of ridiculousness."
"I was a little nervous about trying this but overall it's just a really great(but strong) hoppy beer."
"D: I think I liked it better on tap but damn as a brewer this beer is impressive. Almost dumb in that someone would want to brew this. It is definitely a must try beer though."
"This beer should take the Stone saying. There is no other beer like this with it being so strong but yet so drinkable."
"All in all, I'm really enjoying this beer, and it's definitely perfect for the rare special event."
"This is the single longest review I have ever written. It's fitting. This is the single most intense beer I have ever experienced."
"It is definitely a unique beer that doesn't align itself very much with other DIPAs. And it is delicious."
"D 2.0 - un-do-able, wouldn't do it again - I would grab a 90 min IPA instead! Too boozy and sweet."
"Drinkability: Well, for the ABV, you're obviously not having more than one. That being said, it's interested, and I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I'd seek it out again. It's more like a barleywine than an IIPA, and the main reason I'd spend the money on a bottle would be to age it, and see how it turns out. There was very little of a hop presence, and like I said, it becomes almost unbearably sweet after awhile. It was difficult to finish this one - and not because of the alcohol, but because of the overwhelming sweetness. Still, I'm glad I tried it."
"It pours a deep, deep amber color...maybe burnt orange mixed with a touch of brown. There isn't much if a head and I don't expect one because of the high alcohol. The smell is syrupy and not at all of hops and so is the taste. I like it for some reason even though I know no shouldn't. It's almost more of a barleywine...not really but it's thick enough and malty enough to be one. There is a definite alcohol hottness to it and you feel the deep alcohol burn down in your stomach long after you've taken a sip. It's not crisp at all, which is what I look for in a highly hopped beer. Anyway, as I said, for some weird reason I like it...maybe it's just for novelty reasons. I wouldn't consider it one of my go-to beers!"
"I'm glad that I tried this beer, but I don't think I'll be picking it up again, especially since it's so expensive."
"Lastly, this is NOT a bad beer. I just don't think it is and IPA as advertised. This would get knocked if being judged and essentially I am judging it. If they called it a barelywine and I expected a barleywine like beer I may have enjoyed it more."
"Drinkability: Is this a highly drinkable brew? Not by any means, this is a beer to be consumed solely by itself, anything after this is really just a regular beer. For what it is worth, I felt that this beer lays down the groundwork of what brewers can actually do to make a beer so extreme and out of the box. A wonderful concoction here by DFH, make sure your not driving after consuming this bad boy!"
"A pretty over the top beer, and definitely worth trying. I was shocked that it wasn't more bitter with all the hops, and impressed with how balanced it was."
"Overall this beer is very different from anything out there. I did enjoy it because it was such a different experience. I'm glad i was able to try it but at the price and extreme nature of this beer surpassing 20% abv i won't go out of my way to try it again but worth it at least once."
"I had no desire to take more than a couple sips. I understand this is an extreme beer, but a beer needs to have some drinkability."
"Oh and be sure to get a Heaven and Hell if they have World wide Stout on tap-one word-WOW!!"
"D= Not too bad. I thought this one was just gonna be a waste. I figured this might be my first drain pour actually, but I love it. It's huge and I prolly will never drink more than one but I like this one. Great special occasion beer."
"The first time I had this beer, I enjoyed it immensely, but I thought perhaps the novelty might wear off with another try. That was not the case. $9 a bottle might seem steep, but considering $9 would barely buy two crappy beers at a bar...and two beers which wouldn't taste nearly as good and wouldn't give you as intense a buzz, it's really not that bad a price."
"After the 90 and 60 minute version of this beer I was really looking forward to this one. It was a real nice pretty pour, with a nice almost orange juice crossed with muddy water appearance. Unfortunately, there was no head to speak of. The aroma was a mix of floral hops and citrus, but they were so overpowered by the alcohol smell that they might as well have not been there. The taste was what I would imagine a beer schnapps to be like, overt alcohol presence dimmed just slightly by lemon and hops. But if I had to place it in a realm of known tastes I would say it was like drinking a glass of gin with a touch of sugar and a drop or two of liquid hop extract. I guess what I am trying to say is that this one needs time to mellow out and finish its fermentation. I was so ready to love this one, but will have to wait until it calms down and finishes aging until I do so again."
"obviously an extreme beer, but better than expected. probably not worth the $10 you have to shell out for it though..."
"o: not my cup of tea"
"Bottle dated April 2008--9 months old at the time of review. Pours a thick orange/copper with a small eggshell head. The foam dissipates quickly to leave some wispy traces and a collar. Small amounts of sediment. Smells...big. Definite floral hops, but there's so much sweet, biscuity malt that it's hard to decide which is dominant. Apricot jelly/syrup mixed with a bit of apple cider vinegar. Incredibly boozy--I've never actually had a beer that burned my nose upon sniffing. Very loosely reminiscent of a brandy. It's all sweet malt and alcohol upon tasting. Some hop flavor and bitterness, but it's really quite masked. Warming (burning) finish. A syrupy, boozy mess."
"D: This beer is strong, and not that drinkable; you never really get used to the potent smell, and the more you sip the beer the sweeter it gets."
"D- I'd call this a novelty beer. I'm happy I got to try it but having even two of these in a night would incur roaring drunkenness!"
"D - the drink is really hampered by the overall texture of the beer; if it werent a chore to drink it, and were a bit lighter the sure I would have another, despite it not tasting amazing"
"An impressive murky gold/orange pour. Very large white head. Aroma is powerful hops with some underlying citrus, grass and some sugar. Flavor is completely dominated by that sweetness. Syrupy honey, molasses and raisin. Not much citrus. Sticky/chewy mouthfeel in the heavy medium body. The hops really struggle to balance this out and pretty much can not do it. Does not finish nearly as sticky as it starts, is fairly clean. I actually liked this because it was nothing like an IPA, but if that's what you're looking for, this will not be for you. Definetely closer to an English Barleywine."
"D - very strong at first but as you progress through the beer it becomes easier to drink, when you take a sip you kind of get the warm feeing you get when you take a shot of whiskey"
"d: way too sweet, but i've got three left from the same batch, i'm thinking one every two years to gauge the changes as it ages. this was my least favorite of the dogfish head 20 percenters."
"This beer is so over the top that I couldn't even finish an 8 0z glass. It looked great with a murky orange and big meringue like head. Down hill from there. Smelled overly sweet like maple syrup. Taste was even more ridiculous with its sweetness that was so unbalanced. Mouthfeel was thick and chewy. Drinkability is as low as it gets IMO. Put it all together with price and it's a joke...a very expensive joke."
"This is a perfect sipper, great for a treat, good to share. A little heavy on the body but as this beer ages I'm sure it goes through many subtle changes."
"No way to mask the alcohol, when you pop the top it screams at you. Pours a hazy amber with light head, and the nose jumps out as alcohol, maybe apricot or some fruit, and more alcohol. Taste is moonshine, not enough done to mask the booze, its almost like mixing expired cough syrup with vodka. Try it once, just to say you did, but I would not go back, especially at the price. Maybe just not my style, though."
"First, I love this """beer""". Had to have it sent Fedex to my house. Ohio has beer laws that prevent it's availability in the market. Thank You New Jersey!! It's a beautiful orange-ish, cloudy ale with a thick tan head, (kinda like me). The smell is citrus and malt. Lots and lots of malt. Taste is instant hops and alcohol. So much alcohol that I haven't been able to drink 2 in an evening, at home, of course. Great to split with a couple friends, but the drinkability is very tough. Every Hop Head should try it once...OK twice"
"D- a bitter disappointment pun intended."
"Absolutely, Positively, THE most hoppy beer I've ever had by far. This makes it an almost impossibly hard beer to get through, as the hop character overpowers every other characteristic. If you're looking to add a notch to your IPA belt, go for it. But if you just want a good beer, go elsewhere."
"D- After I poured this one into my snifter I added a few ounces of water to the bottle, swirled out the sediment, and drank that down- could've been a normal pale ale. This I think demonstrates the raw power of 120. But really while drinking it I didn't notice the power, not the alcohol, but the delicious caramel and orange flavors. I could very much enjoy this beer as a nightcap, if I was a richer man that is. But for this special occasion of my 200th review, and 2nd year BA anniversary, this beer is a delicious tribute indeed."
"Look, I love DF Head, hops, IPAs, and even DIPAs, but I'm not sure WHAT this was... other than truly UNIQUE."
"The exception already noted, this beer gets better and better further through the bottle. I get the impression on both the nose and palate that the hops used are a little scattered and unfocused. It creates an experience which is a bit all over the place and extremely unclean. I like my hoppy beers to be clean (thus my preference for West Coast IPAs). This beer is well balanced, even fresh; and it is easy to see how this beer would change with cellar time. I'd like to try that at some point, and I do wish this were more available for me."
"This beer pours a dark orange with a nice frothy white head that quickly disappears. Smells like a huge IPA with pine and a hoppy sweetness. Tastes incredibly strong with alcohol at the begining, middle and end with classic Piny, grapefruity tastes throughout. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Drinkability is decent considering the outrageous abv. I split this one and probably could of drank the bottle if I really took my time. Overall I am really glad I tried this."
"This is a standout beer and very good double IPA."
"Overall this takes hops to a new extreme. Definitely something unique that everyone should try once."
"I would have liked to see more hops added instead of this sugar/sweetness combination to mask the alcohol. Still impressive feat but for about $8 a bottle this isn't worth it to me. Still fun to try once."
"d: My second DFH 120.. Time to retire from this one.."
"Terrific beer, a DIPA liqueur really, and one I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Very unique and, though expensive, well worth enjoying one and cellaring a couple, if one can afford it."
"A tad too sweet for my taste buds. Still a happy experience. I stop at one. But, will definitely have it again."
"D= A very interesting beer here. Not something I will want to drink too often or in very high quantities (thus reducing its drinkability). It is a well crafted beer however and one that everyone should try from time to time and certainly a great candidate for aging a year (or three)."
"I would be a big liar if I said this was drinkable. Imagine drinking this everyday? and at $8.50 for a 12 oz. It's irrational to pay that much when for 54 cents more I could get a whole 6-pack of Sierra Torpedo or Hopdevil."
"I had this on draft at the brew pub and got a four pack to take with me from the brewery. It's an overwhelming beer. It's a stretch to call it an IPA, this beer is more of maybe a monster IPA. The beer looks good, has a nice golden color. It smells good, but with more maltiness. The taste is very multidimensional. It's more like a port in terms of the sweetness, but the flavors are all over the place with a nice focus in the hops, with a slightly bitter finishing bite that regresses back to sweetness. The hops flavor doesn't stay long though because of the extreme alcohol. The flavor endures for a good 30 seconds after swallowing this beast with all sorts of sweet fruity goodness. I'm excited to try the beers I've been aging this summer to see what happens. A great beer for a special occasion."
"Notes: Although this monster is super sweet, it hides the 20% abv pretty well. I think there's a lot of complexity on the palate, more than most critics want to admit to. Yes, it's unbalanced, but who ever thought they were going for balance with a 2 hour boil and 45-degree plato? I tried this beer two years ago and thought it was marginally """overpriced," but my opinion has changed. I dig it and I think it's worth the money."
"Certainly not an every day beer. I can only take down this amount of alcohol in one beer if I am at home surrounded by people who love me that i also trust. But on those occasions where you only want one, but want the effect of many, this is great. winter is the right time, with a fire roaring. the first taste may put you off, pretty alcohol filled. after that it is smooth as silk. it has a big thick mouth feel. one of my top 3 beers, under the right circumstances"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a deep clear orange with minimal head. The aroma is very sweet and medicinal. There are very strong alcohol notes as well. IMO the flavor is more of a strong Belgian than a DIPA. The flavor profile is of a sweet booze with a hint of grapefruit. The beer is full bodied with moderate carbonation. With a 21% ABV 120 is a definite sipper. This is a beer evry one should try, a high alcohol beer with a great flavor profile."
"A great beer for the hophead in you. I would certainly buy it again, but be weary of having more than one."
"Update: Drank the second bottle that same night!"
"D. The experience was just too complex for me. Too many flavors mixing with alcohol. I suppose I could develop a taste for this beer overtime, but found the experience overwhelming from a beer drinking perspective."
"Pours a light red body, clear, small white head. Dark fruit plummy aroma, sweet, some alcohol, no hops whatsoever. Strong sweet flavor, some flavors like roasted, dark fruit. Almost woodsy. Some alcohol. (bottled 5/10/07, aged in a cool fridge) Pours a darker red color, white head, small & not lasting. Very hoppy aroma, bitter. Very hoppy taste, non-sweet grapefruit aftertaste. Some alcohol, some dark fruit. More balanced."
"(p.s. I tried a Duck Rabbit 2008 Barley Wine just the other day that was hoppier than this.)"
"certainly not a very drinkable beer with such a high abv but worth having in the fridge for solo occasions to sip and ponder."
"D - You obviously shouldn't plan on driving anywhere. In fact, I'd schedule this as the first beer of the night or you're in for trouble. It will always be a novelty beer for me."
"D - A very nice sipper."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, I went into drinking this beer with an open mind. Like I stated above, this beer seemed to have many similar features of a barleywine and less of the IPA. To me this was a positive, but to others, I can see how this might be a negative."
"Wow... Absolutely overwhelming. I was very anxious to try this brew because I love the 60 and 90 minute IPA's but this cannot even be categorized with those beers. I guess I didn't know what to expect from a 21% beer, but I was at least expecting somewhat of an IPA taste. This tasted like a really strong, bitter, slightly carbonated wine. In my opinion, no resemblance whatsoever. I would probably have rated this beer higher if I knew what I was in for when I tried it for the first time. I would definitely say its worth picking up, but do not do so on the shear fact that you like 60 and 90 minutes as there is almost no similarities other than the name. If you like barley wines, definitely pick one up and try it. If you are a big IPA fan and are looking for a new imperial IPA to try, heads up, grab a bear republic, stone ruination, a 90 min, or something else. Only available in 12oz singles, my suggestion is that if you havn't had this yet, split it with one other person and/or pour it into a wine glass. The 25-27% ABV Sam Adams Utopias is normally poured in 2oz and this seems like beer that is best in small servings. I poured this into a pint glass and drank the whole thing and when I buy this again I am just pouring it into a small drink/wine glass and drinking a little at a time. This way, I may appreciate the taste more as opposed to trying to finish the whole 12oz bottle/"
"D - Slowly. This was worth trying and I appreciate the craft in attempting to make such a big beer, but this just was not my style."
"I love DFH. Their beers were really the driving force of me becoming a beer lover rather than a beer consumer. And I love the fact that they are pushing the envelope. However, the 120 is more of an experiment - and the results of the experiment are a crazy big beer, but not one that really tastes that good or is particularly enjoyable."
"Have heard about the 120 for a long time and had to try it. I am a big fan of the other Dogfish Head IPA's. But at $10.00 a bottle and 21% ABV not something I would indulge in very often. Had to hide the sales slip from my wife."
"We drank a bit of this when the local beer bar accidently was selling it half off on wednesdays for $4.25. What a dangerous steal."
"I have a 2005 version of this & will buy a fresh bottle to compare, but not until i have two people to help me with it."
"This is simply not my kind of beer, though I appreciate just how good this beer is. This was just way too strong and wine tasting for my likes. While it was extremely smooth, this simply is not how I want my IPAs to taste."
"The pour on this leaves a very cloudy thick body, it's intimidating from the get go. It looks thick and smells completely different than I imagened. I assumed this beer would beer unbelievably hoppy, and while there is plenty of hoppyness on the nose, there's a ton of malty smells of raisens and peaty sweetness. The tast is similar but with definate alcohol pinch. It's very smooth with consideration to the alcohol and it really does ride the malt notes as much as the flower hop flavors. A great beer that everyone should at least try but I do recommend you tell them that drinking one is the same as drinking four+ standard strength beers."
"Well, this is an extreme brew. Good to sip from the snifter, as the bouquet is important to this one. Atmosphere, good flavor (although not very complex), good feel. I definitely recommend this great over the top quaff."
"A: Golden copper color with a slight amber edge, thin layer of tightly packed head which dropped into patches on top - 4.00, S: Thick and aromatic, absolutely saturated with smells, reminds me of a brandy more than a beer, lots of candied sugars and signs of honey couple with a solid wallop of citrusy hops - 5.00, T: Like the nose this beer almost pushes one into sensory overload, heaps of overripe fruit flavors - primarily plums along with a solid infusion of honey which boosts the sugar level of this beer to astronomical levels, all of this is nicely balanced with a boatload of hops though I would not call that the dominate feature - 4.00, M: Slightly syrupy - 4.00, D: What a nice late night sipping beer, loaded to the gills with flavors and aromas, the price makes it a little prohibitive for routine drinking, but on special occasions it should be easy to justify - 4.25"
"Surprisingly sweet and easy to drink for something that's so massively full of alcohol. HUGE hop taste here too, and a pretty good hoppy aroma as well. This mother is going to straight up knock you on your ass but you're going to love every minute of it."
"Buy one to share. I have another and I'm going to age it for a couple of years."
"This beer cost me $9.57 at the local spirits store and it was worth every penny. The balance between the strength and smoothness of this beer is incredible and is deceptively drinkable. Highly recommended to anyone that has the 10 or so dollars to purchase it."
"Shared this with my brother which I would recommend doing. Pours a nice light brown shade with a big white head and a very sticky lace. The aroma is filled with a grapefruit hop aroma that dominates. The taste is actually almost the complete opposite as the hops are present at first but then the sweet malt takes over coupled with some notes of brown sugar. For such a potent beer this is dangerously drinkable since the alcohol is very well hidden. A sipper but a great beer."
"The aroma, and flavor was the best I've ever experienced, in the hop catagory. Very pungent citrus, and pine aromas and flavors. A little sweet from the massive amount of malts used. Very hot with alcohol (to be expected). At 21.0% ABV, it's not that drinkable."
"Notes: This one is like an Imperial Barleywine, if there was such a thing. . . ."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep orange/amber with a smallish off white head that leaves us much to soon. Smells of hops, no kidding huh? Resinous Piny Citrusy hops. Lots of malt in the nose as well, caramel, burnt sugar, biscuit. Taste follows the nose, first a hop assault of grapefruit, resin and pine then the caramel, molasses malts mixed in with a little alcohol. Desceptively easy to drink for such a strong brew. Mouthfeel is syrupy, Body is thick, carbonation is moderate. Wow that is one big beer! We both loved this brew."
"What a nice Christmas present! I poured it into a snifter and let it warm up a bit out of the fridge. The beer poured a very hazy, amber with a frothy white head. The nose is extremely malty with lots of dates, biscuit and brown sugar. The taste is phenomenal. This tastes like beer despite the ABV. I'm not sure how they did it, but this is quite dangerous. I notice a lot of fruity hops and lots of bready malts as I drink. The alcohol is warming and seems to keep you interested in the beer. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth and the drinkability is hard to believe. What a beer!"
"Pours a cloudy orange with a thin head, smell is very citrusy and hop filled. First taste I was not prepared for.. felt like a full on shot of booze.. didn't sit well with me. The next sip, and following sips for that matter, went down much smoother. Maybe I had to warm up to it? Either way, it was enjoyable after the initial sip of it. Was it simply amazing? I wouldn't say that.. but it was cool to have a beer that is 21% ABV and I would have it again in a heartbeat."
"Aromatic hop notes and a low carbonation level. The head within the bottle has a irreverence of multiple colors like blue and purple. The pour produced an red amber body and light white wispy head. The body was very thick and akin to cough syrup. The hop flavor was muted and overall produced a substantial disappointment. I was not expecting the camel flavor or lack there off. I was constantly reminded of cough syrup and to flavors which do not meld. The alcohol was very moderated and reduced to a warming after effect."
"Hats off for making a DIPA that is moderately drinkable and 21% ABV. Will I be buying again? Probably not, but I am surely glad I tried it."
"Overall: If you are complaining or rating this puppy low due to """ABV BURN""" or the intensity of it then you might as well skip this one and go back to drinking your Blue Moon or oh so flavorful Boston Lager. This thing was made for extremity not for the faint of heart. Confused? Did you expect for a 21% ABV to be light? Maybe you actually have balls and a tongue that exists outside of boring, maybe you should buy it and expect exactly what it is. All in all, one of the most creative IIPAs Ive had in while and definitely worth a try as well as a second buy. GET CRUNK! Thank you Sam."
"An unbelievable beer. I'm not sure if i should judge it by its uniqueness or compare it to any other beer. I think i'll take the middle road. A fantastic experimental brew, but way to cloyingly sweet to even think about having another one for quite a while. The hops are great, i love them. The bitterness is nice too, just not enough there to balance the sweetness. Can't wait to try an aged version."
"Drinkability - Overall an awesome beer, not sure if it's a beer I should enjoy all by myself (not sure if i should, but definitely will finish). I'd be interested in trying a again but after it's had a decent shot at aging."
"Truly excellent."
"This is one mind-altering brew. Had it on tap at the DFH alehouse in Falls Church, I was charged $10.50. Cloudy bronze appearance in the what I think was 12 oz sniffer glass with a reasonable head of foam. The flavor and mouthfeel are excellent. Great marriage of hops and alcohol, this beer will kick your ass if you take a big gulp of it."
"Big ups to JeffV for this trade, I feel like a tool for not hooking him up with any extras. Karma to you bro.."
"This beer is something to experience, an assault of concentrated beer flavors that needs to be sipped. I cant imagine the amount of malt and hops they use to make this. Try it."
"(rated Apr 11, 2007)"
"3.85 | 4.25 | 4.6 | 4.75 | 4.4"
"Had an oaked version of this on tap at Dogfish's Milton brewery. Nice orangey color and a suprisingly well maintained head. You can certainly smell the alcohol but it's not as overpowering as you'd expect from a 20% brew. There is a slight spiciness from the oak at the first taste. This did seem to abate after each sip, no doubt in due to the high abv. Very oily mouthfeel which I love in this beer. This was perilously easy to drink so it's a good thing this was only about a 6oz taste."
"My hat is off to those sensible folks 75 years ago who reinstated the law and the mindset that paved the way for a brewery like Dogfish Head to create such a sexy beast as this offering."
"I finally found this one. Light brown pour with a thick, short white head. Huge hoppy aroma, with resin, wood, pine, and earthiness. Massive, syrupy hop flavor, with more caramel and malt than expected (or wanted). Big resiny character, with little to no grapefruit/citrus. As good as this was, it was anticlimactic. Maybe I just built up the expectations to be too high. Great, but there are better IIPA's out there."
"D: This is a tasty beer, but not one I could drink all the time. Still, a well made beer."
"Reviewed on 4/26/08. Bottle. Poured an orange/amber with a surprising small white head and slight carbonation! Aroma of pine, acetone (aka nail polish remover), and slight grapefruit. Initial taste of super sweet malt, followed by slight bitter hops. A slow sipper for sure! The highest %abv brew that I've actually enjoyed somewhat! Still, it was a difficult beer to drink. An experience every beer geek should have, but I'm not sure I'd buy this one again. 6/4/7/3/15 (3.5/5)"
"WOW! pours a maple syrup color but not the consistency. Aroma is pure malt heaven with a touch of hops, and the alcohol. Taste is malt, malt, and malt (like syrup) OH! did I mention the alcohol...WOW!! Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy, alcohol warms your mouth and your body. Drinkability is average because you will be just shit faced!!"
"It was fine to drink once I cut my losses and said... well it's not what you were looking for. Just wasn't the IPA taste that I know and love."
"Pours a hazy amber color with thin white head. Aroma is dominated by hops of course but there is also a strong alcohol presence. This is an extremely hoppy beer that is to be sipped slowly. Although the flavor is dominated by bitter hoppiness, I feel that the 21% abv provides a strong alcohol taste and warmth that takes away from this flavor. I liked this beer very much but wished that the high abv was masked a bit more."
"What the hell was that?!? I don'r know what I was expecting but this was an interesting drink. I could taste the 21% from the first sip which is not a good thing since I was hoping the complexity of the beer could mask it a bit better. I would not call this beer an IPA so not sure how to rate it. It is very, very sweet and not at all bitter. I could not finish the whole bottle by myself but not from the strength of the beer bbut from the sweet, syrupy mouthfeel. I love the Dogfish and most of the brews I have had but this was a bit much for me."
"Poured this lighter amber coloration of cloudy honey beer into a pint glass. It was definately interesting in the aroma as it has a good spicy hoppy beer smell. However, the taste far exceeds the aroma in its hoppy citrus, robust flavor. It has hints of spice even in the taste and is wonderful on the palate! It is a sweet but spiced hop beer that has a great aftertaste finish compared to other high gravity beers."
"Cloudy honey color with some white head. The nose is super sweet, interesting. The flavor is a malty sweetness with some light hops in the background. While good it's very sweet. It's a nice beer but very sweet."
"This is a case where the grading criteria is seriously distorting my ability to tell you how I feel about this beer. Is is supposed to be drinkable? Could it smell or taste anything but boozy at 20%? It's an amazing substitute for a cordial but ..."
"Overall, very interesting beer. A little overboard on the sugary sweetness scale, which knocks it down a notch. But I'd enjoy one of these every once in awhile"
"I really loved this, however, after about 6 ounces I was satisfied, as she really is a doozey in terms of ABV and flavors."
"Very expensive beer (12 bones/bottle) but definitely one you have to try! Just make sure you stop at 1!"
"So the mystery question to all fellow brewers - how the heck do they get it down to 1.020 and maintain that sweetness?"
"Overall: Unique, unique, and unique. I think I got my point across. I was actually a lot more impressed with this beer then I thought I would be, but to be honest, the taste is more unique than good. Not bad at all in the flavor category, but something I won't be dying to get again. Worth a try, but make sure you enjoy a bottle with another person...I made the mistake of drinking this one all to myself. Good job Dogfish Head...you pulled this one off quite well. Cheers!"
"D- This is one of the biggest beers, yet it really goes down so easily. This is my favorite beer to share with people who have never tried it. I say, trust me, you won't expect this stuff. The problem is I'm never gonna age this stuff if I keep popping them. So expensive!"
"The color is a deep rich yellow, quarter inch of white head. Smells of citrus and citrus and citrus. Taste is over the top, so much citrus it's like having a glass of orange juice. I mean, Goddamn, I love an intense IIPA but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Halfway through the glass I was getting tired of the stuff. Carbonation is intense but in the ballpark, and the outrageous alcohol content is impressively well-hidden. But the fruit-juice flavor makes it hard to drink."
"if you can get it check it out, but the price and the crazy high abv really make it hard for me to drink this beer"
"D- For the ABV, this is obviously a sipper. But is so unique and tasty, you have to appreciate the work that went into this. It is a tasty treat and I am anxious to see how one of these ages."
"It's very unique brew, very balanced, warming and complex with very nice citrus notes. Alcohol is very well hidden there for 21% and it is not dry at all. Very nice."
"Overall a real unique beer that everyone should be lucky enough to try. It really is a testament to DFH that they actually make this beer, it is groundbreaking."
"At $8.99 for a 12 oz. bottle it was worth trying once."
"Slick, begining mouthfeel almost detects high abv, but by the way it goes down you would never know. more please"
"I probably would have appreciated this beer more, if I got any hop character out of it."
"An experience."
"Hops, hops and too much hops? Probably, but somehow Dogfish Head has found a way to balance this off-centered brew. Pours a dark amber color with a head that never seems to completely dissipate. The smell of this beer is extremely pungent and floral. Beyond huge hop taste with an incredibly sweet and sugary malt character. The mouth feel varies from person to person but if you enjoy an all out assault on your taste buds you have to try this beer at least once. This is the Holy Grail of huge Ipa's."
"2008 Poured a nice orange color with a small white head, little carbonation. Nose was a blast of alcohol, citrus notes, and maybe some wood and caramel malt. Taste was just obnoxious. ABV was to much, all I tasted minus the small notes of malts and slight citrus with no hop bitterness(ABV probably killed that too). Not balanced noMouthfeel was bad, could not stand to really swish it around. Going down it was not smooth. ABV is up there and the taste was just..not good.Not for me! C-"
"It has been a while since I have found a five but this is it. Pours with a three-finger, bubbly cream head that fades slowly and leaves a nice lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is sweet, gingery, malty. Starts with a perfect mix of malt and hops and finishes smooth and sweet NOT a session beer . . . savor this beer . . . their site has this at 20% ABV. Medium bodied. This is the best IPA brewed in the States. Worth $7.99 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, Me"
"D-NOT an everyday drinker"
"NC Beer monger loves this beer, too bad we can't get it in NC!"
"Nevertheless, I heartily recommend sharing this beer after a good dinner at least once. It is expertly crafted by the artists at DFH. Thanks for the opportunity! I hope to get my hands on some World Wide Stout in the future, after this."
"This. Beer. Has. Balls. 21% is no joke. Pours nice darkish amber w/ not a big head, but it lasts. Smells fantastic - really refreshing and extremely fruity and sweet. Taste is similar - kind of took me by surprise. Its thick and syrupy and really carbonated, all of which are a nice blend with the high alcohol volume. High alcohol makes this a very slow drinker, but each sip is so fulfilling that it works out nicely. Highly recommended - I'll be getting more of this to age for a few years."
"D: Beer took me 3 hours to drink.. maybe a bit longer. I had to sip it like I was sipping a glass of scotch. Couldn't ever drink more than one of these at a time.. ever. Highly recommend it, and I have one put away to try again in a year or two to try and see the difference. Recommend that everyone try this one at least once."
""""What just happened?""" I asked out loud as I took my first sip of this concoction and coughed. The aroma smells as if I'm homebrewing in my kitchen, but a full night of brewing was crammed into one bottle. I think I may have just smacked my mama. I have never had anything like this before. Not for the faint of heart or palate. If you don't like hops, stay the hell away fron anyone even drinking this, but if you're a big IPA fan, and I mean a fan of big IPAs not a big fan, take the plunge. You'll never forget it. Drinkability, however is a little down because I think I may have trouble getting through this one beer."
"I literally can't imagine a more hoppy beer. Fun to drink."
"It is easy on the palate, note aforementioned lack of alcohol burn. I would say that you can drink a few rounds of these but a single 12 oz bottle will be enough to make you pass out."
"I was shocked that the beer was as light as it was in color. My initial reaction was to the wondeful scent of this beer, it had a great array of fruity scents, a touch of sweetness and of course a sort of grain alcohol burn too. I didn't get a bunch but I had a good 5oz's and it was enough to see why it has a great reputation. It had an amazing taste that lingered for quite some time. The alcohol isn't nearly as present as I thought for a 21% beer, I would do this again in a heartbeat!"
"Finally got to try this monster and I'm glad I did. Hazy golden colour with a bubbling thick white head. It smells fantastic and invites the first sip. In the mouth there was an initial shock from the overdose of hops, but then there is a sweetness from the malt that balances it out. Not to say that this is a balanced beer! It's certainly not that, but it is still surprisingly drinkable. There is a warmth from the alcohol, but not a huge burn like I was expecting from such a big brew. Ace. I want more."
"Poured a bright copper into my Brooklyn stem. Whitesh frothy head. Aromas of sticky fruit punch...big alcohol notes. Taste of moonshine soaked peaches, grapefruit and lemon cocktail. Sweet molasses malt taste before the fruit moonshine onslaught. Sweet, huge hoppy bitter. Strange, but very drinkable for a 20+ percent crazy IPA."
"light amber color that is very hazy. one finger of head that maintains pretty well. the taste is ridiculously boozy, sweet and nauseating. the thick sweetness coats your mouth and before you can work your way around that the booze kicks in. mouthpuckering and makes you cringe. in no way drinkable. could not even come close to finishing this one."
"On tap at Moe's Tavern Anniverseray party in Lee, MA. Pours a cloudy orange color with a decent size head. Nice lacing also. This stuff tastes like you drink hard alcohol. At 21% i see why. This is a sipping beer. Rush this one to much and it will kick you in the caboose. Has an aroma of like a hoppy scotch practicly. A little to much. I was surprised how quickly i finished it. The drinkability is not that bad. Don't want to end a night on this one thats for sure."
"this is the king of ipa's. not my favorite but it is the most unique. The color is a cloudy, orangey color. The pour is kind of syrupy but not like the raison d'extra. The aroma is estery and hoppy. some malty notes are present. the taste is like a kick in the mouth. super hoppy and a decent alcohol taste. the mouthfeel is kind of syrupy. i couldnt drink more than 1 of these. a must try for beer afficienados."
"A 12oz bottle can be shared with 2-3 people. Even though I tackled the whole mamma jamma myself. Dogfish kicks ass. Raise the bar my brothas."
"D: I've been drinking this beer for well over a half hour and have barely gotten halfway though. For as big as this beer is, it hasn't turned into a giant boozy mess and this shows incredible skill on the part of the brewer. An amazing accomplishment to say the least, and certainly an adventure to drink. The taste and complexity of this beer make for an interesting drinking session, not to mention the size of this beast, whose size, though it lets you know it's bit, still stays remarkably well hidden."
"d. This is definitely a big brew, and it's pretty much in its own field. Definitely for sipping, this one was almost too over the top - and I love over the top brews. You have to try it if you have any interest at all... but whether or not you need another one in your life is up to you. Definitely an experience."
"D- I could easily sip on a couple of these. It tastes like nothing I've ever had before but in the good sense. Not your typical IPA but very interesting and good all around. I will hopefully have another one of these in the future."
"Overall: an experience"
"I love this beer, I didn't like IPA's that much until I had this one, it actually turned me on to several other IPA's"
"This stuff is a whopper. The real deal. Bought a single bottle from DFH Brewings and Eats in Rehoboth. Drank it one night on the porch in a standard pint glass. Open er up, get a whiff. Wow. Felt loaded just smelling it. Hops bitterness will hit you, but it's perfectly balanced with syrupy sweetness. Very big beer. Felt like I was burping raw hop flowers the whole night. This one worths the high price tag per bottle. Had a tough time getting up out of the chair after I finished it though, beware."
"I would not stock my fridge with this beer, but highly recommend trying it at least once. It's a very interesting beer."
"D- This goes down very easy for a 20+% ABV beer. It's smooth and well-rounded, and not nearly as astringent as I would have immagined. Overall, a really solid beer that dares to cross lines and push limits."
"D: Considering the ABV the beer is drinkable but I'm not sure I would see out again. Just a little too overwhelming but I'm glad i finally had it."
"I believe there was probably something wrong with my bottle leading me to believe that maybe the brewing process used for this beer is a little hit or miss and i got one of the misses. i plan on trying this beer again at another venue and finding out."
"I'm not a fan of the syrupy feel or the dry grainy finish.. This beer is a heavy sweater on a summer day. It's a novelty act that almost becomes undrinkable because of the high ABV. Definitely a sipper or a chugger if you want alcohol poisoning. I would recommend trying this one once and then aging it for a few years. Perhaps the negatives will mellow and accent the positives after some age."
"I had this out of the bottle once, and i dont think the bottle has that old and i did not enjoy at all, way to much alcohol and not a good hop balance, but on tap a totally different beast"
"D- For this one being so high on ABV its really easy to drink. For sure you can't drink a lot of this and a sipper for sure."
"The aroma was a noseful of hops. It poured farily thick without much head for me. I enjoyed it, and am glad I tried it, but would not go out of my way to buy it again. It was just too difficult to drink, because it was as thick as syrup. Splitting this with another person or several others is the way to go.."
"D- This is such an expensive beer I just want to curl up and die thinking I just drank 20 dollars away in 2 minutes! Due to the insane impossibility of a Californian getting this beer for anything short of a good trade on here, i have to give drinkability a 'four'."
"I think this is a very good beer. I feel if your thinking about it, don't hesitate, buy one. Yes I thought twice when I saw it was over 8 bucks for 12 oz. I can't wait to see how well the other 2 I bought age."
"I think anyone who goes for one of these pobably has an idea of what they are getting into.. I was pleasantly surprised, however, that a lot of what I was expecting turned out to be incorrect. For such a high ABV beer I was expecting a much, much thicker, sludgey, malt-bomb. Indeed, there is a ton of malt in the smell and flavor, but it is (somehow) balanced quite impressively, that is, while working on this scale, with hop. It doesn't look the way I thought it might look (its a very cark, cloudy copper/orange). It smells very strongly of both hop and malt, moreso than even the 60 min IPA's malt aroma. The taste has a lot of hoppy tree/forest-like essence right behind an upfront flavor of dark cherries and raisen sweetness. The mouth isn't nearly as heavy as I was expecting, aside from the somewhat-extreme taste, its ABV isn't so noticeable in the mouthfeel. It is a little syrupy, however.Drinkability is a hard one to determine... on one hand, it's pretty extreme in aroma, flavor, etc. And, of course, its over 20% alcohol (and, I believe, something like 500 calories according to the DFH website). However, it definetely gains points for not being really that difficult to get thru or swallow. Its really good. As long as you in the mood for some heavy taste and aroma, as well as to be pretty drunk, its a good one."
"Very smooth and creamy for the abv. Alcohol was hidden quite well. Suprisingly drinkable for 21%."
"I finally got my chance at The Holy Grail! I was expecting some sort of undrinkable wallop, but what I got was a delightful and delicious experience. Poured a dark, hazy copper with very creamy head that stuck around. Obviously the hops were apparent from the smell, to the mouth, to the finish, but what I found interesting was the slightly mild fruity finish which almost tasted of apricots. This beer was quite a delight and although one could tell the alcohol was there, it definitely didn't give the impression of being 21%. However, after even my 5.5oz pour, I could tell it was there."
"Drinkability: Had this one with some sharp cheddar cheese, and thank god. This is one biting bastard of a beer. It's spicy, fruity, sweet, bitter, astringent ... how do you even rate a beer like this? This beer improves slightly with warmth, peaks, and then goes precipitously declines in quality. The alcohol is high, but not high enough to make it too difficult for me to spell precipitously. However, that probably shouldn't be the the barometer on what constitutes """too high," and this is pretty high."
"Notes: This is one powerful IPA but it is most definitely one that I will revisit again and again. Just excellent."
"D: I wish that I had more, I would age any more that I had for at least a year or three so the sweetness could mellow out a bit, but a very god beer over all."
"D- Wow, this can creep up on you. Too easy to drink alot and get smashed. Crazy drinkable for the ABV%"
"Mouthfeel and ABV kill drinkabiity for this one for most people. After sipping the first one over an hour or so I could have handled another just fine without any problems but it was so heavy I really didn't want to."
"do it now before its gone!"
"Wonderful ale, I'll look into getting more in the future."
"D - This is an amazing beer. With its high ABV it was actually quite drinkable with great malt and hop flavors."
"It was far to strong to drink more than one of these in a sitting. This beer is just a good daily visit, it is not a session beer at all."
"D -- One is good for me. Two is a little much."
"D - This beer is meant to be enjoyed slowly and with the abv I'd say drink it slow I found it pretty easy to drink with an abv thats twice as strong as a lot of Belgians its almost less noticeable than those beers"
"D: Assaults the senses so this is a sipper. Massive 21% ABV could be dangerous. A monster IPA. You just gotta taste this for yourself."
"taste is creamy, alcohol is definately there, then comes the hops, apricote, and some orange peel in the back."
"D- considering the high ABV this bad boy is only good for one or two a day at most. Finish a sixer of this and you will bein a coma. Good flavor and easy to put down for the most part."
"In my opinion this beer defines extreme beer. Simply a must try for any beer geek, especially hop heads. To be honest I didn't really """like""" this beer but damn do I respect it."
"D: This is a beer to be a appreciated more than drank. It's heavy and the taste can be shocking to the unaccustomed. I've had this beer before and it always takes a gracious amount of time and a lot of little sips in order to retire it."
"overall: not what i was expecting. my initial impression was not good(mentioned that it was served cool). a unique experience indeed. dfh should think about re-categorizing this beer, so as not to have people expecting a typical dipa although i cant find a reason that it doesnt technically fit. one of my first questions was """would i recognize this as beer if i didnt know?""" would i pay 10$ for another? yes but just barely and i'd split it with at least one other person, because i need a nap."
"Surprisingly extensive creamy head covers a light bronze haze. A candied aroma of apricot, pineapple and ginger succeeds at masking the high abv. The taste is fruity and spicy, and there really is no apparent bitterness from the hops. The alcohol is concealed very well by the generously carbonated and full-bodied mouthfeel. 120 Minute IPA is more drinkable than expected, and the only factor keeping it down is the high price (lucky for me or I wouldn't be walking away from this one). All in all this is a great """beer""". Calling it a beer is a stretch. Calling it an IPA is comical. But calling it incredible is an understatement."
"Overall this is a reasonably drinkable beer, and at 21% abv, one or two of these and you're down anyway. I'd drink it again for sure."
"yum"
"It was worth the wait and the $10. Now I have to think about (1) when to drink the rest of them and (2) how to get some more to put up for later. And how the hell do you follow that act?"
"Overall I'm glad I finally got my hands on one of these. Very interesting, and worth a try."
"I will definately keep the other three I bought in storage for a while as these need some time to cure (probably 2 years plus). I loved it and I think in a few years I'll love it even more. I think trying a flight of these from five different years would be interesting. I would liken its current taste to a Samichlaus Helles. Enjoy this one slowly!"
"Drinakablity: A sipping beer that is to be enjoyed on a special occasion."
"The taste is syrupy. There is a hot spiciness from the hops and alcohol content, if you have one two days in a row, your throat will burn the second day. It is intense, but tasty and imaginative. Well deserving to be the choice special occasion beer for hop heads."
"My bottle is the latest batch to come out as it was bottle 7/7/08. Poured into a snifter because I was told this batch was maltier than the usual so I figured I would go with that instead of a winge glass or tulip. Poured a cloudy auburn with gold tints that gave one-finger head that stuck around forever and left a slight lace ring. A complex array of sweet malts like caramel, butterscotch and maybe honey or something. Also in the nose is a great hop presenece that brings both citric fruit notes (lemon) and some tart and dark fruits like sour apples, pear and a little black cherry. My first instinct when trying this is that it would be a """hopbomb", and it VERY hoppy, there is a thickness and stickiness to it from the sweet malts (mostly caramel in this regard). There is also tart and citric fruit tastes in this fuller-bodied beer that rolls across the tongue for the most part (like I said, a tad sticky at some points). The only drawback is a very minor alcohol burn on the backbite which stems from the immense ABV%. For that reason (the ABV, not the burn) and the cost (I'm not rich) prevent me from sessioning this bad boy. This reminded me a of Belgian Triple and maybe a heavy Dubbel, and is one of the best beers I've had in a long, long time. If you haven't tried the current batch I recommend so immediately."
"D: Could I have more than one? Yes. But this is something to share."
"obviously not something to drink everyday but you must at least once treat yourself to this delicious brew."
"Glad I split this bottle, but a worthy beer for certain. Well deserved reputation. A hop-head's hard alcohol."
"As far as drinkability, obviously you wouldn't want to have more than one. In fact, I had to wait till the next day to write the review. However, for the punch that this beer packs, it hides the alcohol taste well, and it is highly enjoyable and is a highly drinkable brew."
"You have to drink this slowly because of the high, high alcohol and the overt sweetness. Interesting experience; glad I tried one, but I probably won't go back for another."
"D: Amazing drinkability, hardly any detection of the massive 20% abv nature which could be dangerous. A monster ipa that was beautifully crafted and balanced. Needless to say one should be plenty enough for an evenings enjoyment. Comes highly recommended and worthy of its price per pound. You just gotta taste this for yourself."
"Being a huge fan of Imperial IPAs I have to say Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA is like the dessert to end all desserts of India Pale Ales. It has a sweetness comparable to an english style barleywine ale with a delicious hint of piney robust hops at the end."
"Much more drinkable than I thought. Some lingering hop resin on the tongue late, not as much as I expected but about as bad as I've had just the same. This was something I'd try once, maybe get halfway through, but I easily finished it, enjoyed the fruity and sweet nature, definitely worth another try."
"I thought I could only take my first 3 oz pour of it, since it was so sweet, but I've gone back for a 2nd pour. I really like this much better at fridge temp, cause when it warms up it gets way too sweet for me. But only wanting to drink about 6oz doesn't equate good drinkability to me, 21% ABV or not."
"D: This is a once in a while/once in a lifetime beer. It is ok, but nothing worth $10 a 12oz bottle. If I had two I'd drink one and age the other for about twenty years and compare, not follow up with another one. 3.0"
"I had this on several occasions now. First time I purchased it at Union Jacks while I was there for the Easter Hop Fest 2008. My next experience was at DFH Brewery Tour and again at the DFH Restaurant, 7/2008. I am now holding a 4 pack for future consumption. Overall I would have to say it is """The Great One""" of IPA's."
"this is an incredibly drinkable Dipa, this goes where none have dared venture, yet is the textbook explanation of a beer brewed to be an extreme ipa doubled. drink in small sips, straight to the back of the throat for your own safety. will anything ever taste hoopy again?"
"Not many."
"D= This would be a nice after-dinner bear in place of a port or brandy. Must be sipped slowly to be enjoyed"
"This beer reminds me alot of a liqour and has a peachy liquor(for lack of a better description) smell to it. The biggest draw back to this beer is the cost at $8.99 a bottle, but you do get your moneys worth. Don't plan on drinking other IPA's with this beer at the same time because it's in a whole other league."
"D- I should rate this lower since this stuff is not some much drinkable as an experience. Ive had bourbons at 40+% abv that were smoother."
"If you call yourself a hophead, give it a try - at least once."
"The infamous 120 minute IPA definitely holds its weight, kinda thick. I love the dogfish head brewery and IPA's, so this was a must try for me, at 21% abv, I was impressed with the taste. However that being said, for the average beer drinker it is semi too much, most non beer enthusiasts will make a face if you let them try or smell it, It is a must try for all IPA lovers but ill stick with the more drinkable 60, or 90."
"Leave it to Dogfish Head to not push but eviscerate the boundaries. 120 Minute IPA is unique, and a must try."
"This may not have ended up ranking as one of my favorites, but it was surely one of the most amazing experiences I have had drinking beer."
"I'm really glad I got a chance to try this one, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again, especially given the price. Perhaps I'll age the other bottle and see what that does, but as it stands I prefer the 90 and even the 60 minute varieties."
"This is a beautiful extreme beer from Dogfish Head. Poured a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Color is a deep rich orangish-copper with little head. Carbonation is present and sticks to the sides of the glass. Smell is in your face hops, pine and candy sweetness. This is a beer you have to sip. It's amazing how this beer can be so incredibly sweet, yet bitter hops shine through at the same time. Delicious."
"Drinkability - Even with the reviews I had read, I was still expecting a hop bomb. Once I get past the fact that this is more of a treat than a true DIPA... it becomes apparent how well made it is. The alcohol is so well masked that I am having trouble believing this is anywhere near 21%. I truly could sip on this to the end of eternity, it has a fantastic blend of everything I would look for in a great beer... I love Belgians and I love IPAs, and it really feels like the perfect blend of the 2. I was setting myself up for disappointment on this one... and its come out my favorite beer in the end."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, the alcohol does not affect the mouthfeel or the taste in any negative way. How do you rate drinkability on a 21 percent beer? I split the 12 oz bottle and had a satisfying amount. Compared to other DIPAs drinkability is average. I will probably get another one to taste so I don't have the fresh hops on my palate and tongue first."
"Normally I do the A,S,T,M,D thing but this beer can't be summed up like that. There is so much going on in the beer that it is tough to put a finger on it. I have had this three times now, every time I split a 12oz bottle with a friend. If you are a beer geek you have to try this one. I am a lowly homebrewer/beer geek. I don't make the stuff or write about the stuff for a living; I just really like it. This beer makes me excited about beer. I don't drink it frequently but I always have a bottle or two on hand """just in case""". This is one to appreciate/enjoy/share/celebrate. Thank you Dogfish head for pushing the limits on brewing and giving me an unobtainable goal of re-creating this in my garage..."
"Chris P"
"I was expecting more from DFH and the ultimate hoppy beer."
"A+++"
"Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA is anything but a typical DIPA. In truth, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. This is one of those cases in which extreme beer is also incredibly good beer. Even though I won't be drinking it often, I'm now a huge fan and will spring for a bottle or two on those rare occasions when I run across them. The bottom line is that this is delicious and surprisingly drinkable hop liqueur."
"I couldnt drink more then one of these in a session, but its a damn fine crafted beer. I will be purchasing more of these to cellar."
"The flavor pretty much backs up the aromas, but expands on them in every direction. In many ways, the flavors are similar to DFH's 60 or 90, but on overdrive. I swear, DFH has a house character which shows up (mostly) in their hoppy brews. Unfortunately (for me), it's a characteristic which I'm not all that excited about, but seems to be very popular with most other people. Whatever the case, I certainly respect DFH and all the envelope-pushing brews they make...including this brew. This is not one of my personal favorite uber-hoppy brews, but there's no denying that it's one of the most idiosyncratic hoppy brews ever brewed!"
"Holy crap in a pita. Poured this into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a decent head. Smell is incredibly hoppy with A LOT of alcohol tacked on. Taste is a hop bomb! Citrusy, hoppy, with an absurd amount of sweet alcohol. Despite the incredibly high ABV, this brew is dangerously drinkable. Definitely a sippper though."
"This is a big boy beer no dought. If you don't drink 10% + beers on a regular basis this will knock you out. I couldn't get enough and was disapointed only in how fast I was able to drink it and wonder if I would ever spend $10 on a 12oz. bottle of beer again."
"Overall drinkability I am rating low because this is really a special beer. I can see someone enjoying this after dinner *sipping SLOWLY* but other than that it's hard to imagine a situation where I'd be really enjoying this. I plan on trying it again sometime, but for my first tasting this was rather dissapointing."
"This is possibly the most inappropriately labeled beverage I've ever had. It's certainly not an imperial india pale ale by any definition in my book. However, it's still an enjoyable after-dinner drink and could be a perfect companion for a great movie. I would also be interested in aging a bottle for several years just to see how it improves or changes."
"pours cloudy and orange almost like an octoberfest, the sent is one of hops and rubbing alcohol, this one is no joke, the first sip shocks your system as to how much hop can be squesed into one glass, this one isent for the faint of hart, the start is hops the middle screams of hops and the finish is a freight train of hops and alcohol, the one i have is a bit green i will get one and maby crack it in about 10 or 12 years from now i think it will mello and sweeten in time, thank hevens for beers this good"
"This is the Château d'Yquem of beer and should be consumed in small doses. The finish is exquisite"
"D - Good for the first beer but a 21% is sneaky one. Maybe two in one sitting... Probably one."
"Pours amber with no lasting head. Smell is alcohol 1st and then some syrupy sweetness. Not even getting any hops out of it. Taste is warming sweet alcohol. Hops are noticeable but mild compared to the heat and intense sweetness. Too sweet for a DIPA, yet drinkable, I suppose, for how strong it is. I'll try it again someday but this didn't excite me, like most of their beers."
"Overall, it is good, not great. From the self proclaimed """Holy grail of hopheads""" I was pretty disappointed, the flavor of the hops was overwhelmed by the sweetness, and the hops flavor that came through just mixed into the alcohol taste. I like most DFH beers, but this was waaay too sweet for me; I suspect this was to help cover the alcohol. For an Imperial IPA, I would take a Bell's Hopslam, or 90 Minute over this any day. However, this is something different than most that I would still want to drink on occasion."
"No overlooking the alcohol here. Gotta go slow and easy and just sip away and enjoy. I love big beers, but couldn't imagine doing 2 in one night!!"
"D - Great beer, really strong at 18%."
"D- The beer is too wine-y o be a session beer, but it is excellent as a single glass, or one to decant and share."
"everything is worth a try at least once. Including this $12.99 bottle of Imperial IPA. Although it's odor is of a pungent rubbing alcohol, the mouthfeel is astonishingly smooth and satisfying. appearance is an impeccable cloudy orange with a thin dense head. taste is citrusy and expectedly alcoholic. A bit like fermented lemon juice. it's all good though, except for the ridiculous price."
"What a brew. This one was exactly as described - hop vodka with a hint of malt. Whereas the 90 minute is only 50% more exciting than the 60 minute, the 120 minute is about 10 times the beer the 90 is. Not you every day drinker, but if you like hops, you owe this one to yourself."
"M/D - Full bodied with good carbonation. It is a little hot with the alcohol, bit overall a very good feel. Doesnt taste like it is 21%. An excellent beer for ending the night."
"Creamy full body has good crisp yet delicate carbonation to keep it active. Amazingly drinkable for the strength. Another impressive creation from DFH. Makes me want to try more of their premium brews."
"Pretty drinkable for its bigness, obviously not a session beer, but I expected more hops. Good sipper, it's almost a sipping liqueur."
"Seems a little hoppier in the mouth than the bottle did, with a little less of the sweetness from the malt. It's still terribly difficult to drink, with a ton of booziness, but the 120 Minute is a truly incredible experience."
"I've wanted to try this for quite some time and last night I finally got my chance. I love the work that Dogfish Head does (especially the 90 Minute IPA) but this one was a bit over the top for me. I found the alcohol overwhelming. I love beer but I don't enjoy hard alcohol and this one felt like a big glass of the hard stuff so it wasn't my thing. I'll just go back to the 90 Minute and save Dogfish Head the extra time."
"Anyway between 60, 90 and 120 minute ipas, the 90 stands out as my favorite as it is more intense and flavorful then the 60 minute ipa, but the 120 minute ipa is almost too intense for everyday."
"Drinkability: A sipper, for sure, but a good one. Really holds itself together fairly well for being packed to the gills with malt, hops, and booze. Like it or not, it's hard not to be having a good time when you finish the bottle."
"D - Nice to have one possible two but this beer is the beer for hopheads and would be very hard to session."
"Dogfish head seems like it can do no wrong. I've loved 6 of the 7 beers I've had from them."
"I am a lover of hops and this was even a little tough for me. A definite nightcap."
"Overall not a bad beer and worth trying but I probably won't buy it again due to the extreme cost for the return."
"Nose on the beer is increadible. Smells like fresh hops! Thouroughly enjoyed kicking back and sipping out of a snifter. The taste was exceptional, very fresh with little after taste. Very well balanced, the high alcohol content does not effect the taste of the beer."
"D: This beer would be a whole lot better if the high alcohol content was not as evident in the taste. I understand that 21% is ridiculously high and that it would be a challenge to mask it, but the alcohol content needs to be hidden a little bit in order to truly enjoy the greatness of this beer. While it was smoother on tap than it was from a bottle, alcohol content is still way too evident."
"Like the World Wide Stout, this is an excellent dessert beer. It's unique and tastey, but in no means typical for the style of a dipa."
"Overall, an interesting beer. The alcohol is surprisingly not dominating, but it is cloyingly sweet and the hops are not that noticeable. The alcohol gets balanced well by the sweetness of the beer."
"The second time around on this beer since last summer and it is still amazing. Opened a 12 ounce bottle late one night and was totally blown away. It is a hazy beer from excessive dry-hopping and long term bottle conditioning. But it is that good, heavy type of haze, more intriguing than a poor chill haze turn-off. The smell is amazing: hops, hops, and plenty of booze hit the nose square as the beer is held. One can open a bottle of this in a wide room and everyone will smell it without putting it up to their nose. Slight vanilla undertones to the massive floral hop notes in the nose of this beer. Also, slightly sweet in the nose, I'm not sure how to describe it, but the beer is definitely not all hops. The taste is I feel described above: massively hoppy and boozy, yet strangely tempered into a hazy brew, easy to drink. Mouthfeel is actually a big thin; makes me wonder what they left out of this beer. Probably nothing; probably I'm a Russian Imperial Snob, but for such a heavy duty beer I was a bit dissapointed. Of course, drinkability is phenomenal. If this beer was produced """en masse," we'd be a community of drunks. Defintely one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability is low. Alcohol is ridiculously high and the flavor isn't really that great. Again, I'd like to see what it does with a few years on it. Don't judge my low rating too harshly. it just doesn't seem appropriate for the style. I kind of like it."
"Notes: My first experience with this near-legendary beer was a good one. If I can find it a couple more I'd really like to lay them down for a while to see how the flavors evolve over time. Unfortunately, as I previously mentioned, I don't think I'll be able to do that for a while. However, it was still quite the beer when fresh. Overall, this experience did not disappoint. Everything that I expected from such an intensely hopped beer, but also surprising in that I found sme balance and an underlying sweetness holding everything together. Truly, this was more than a drink... Rather a meditation on all things beer, an exercise for the tastebuds and a great opportunity for contemplating the good things in life. Definitely recommended"
"For what this beer is; something pushing the extremes of what beer can be, I think it's quite drinkable but at times cloying. I'd like to have a few more of these around for the occasional nightcap. Cheers."
"My favorite thing about this beer is the mouthfeel, and because of it's strength, if you hold it in your mouth, it takes over your senses. After a few seconds it starts to crawl through your sinuses and you pick up some more depth to the scent of this beer."
"Mouthfeel is full but not syrupy, strong drying alcohol, tingling on the tongue, but not much carbonation. Obviously, you won't drink a lot, but it is very pleasant and not at all cloying. Dogfish Head continues to redefine what beer is. Not a novelty, but a new category of beer altogether."
"notes: certainly an extreme beer, it's a really tasty beer and it's proof that American craft brewers are the pioneers in the alcoholic beverage department. This is ground breaking and there's nothing else I've ever tasted that can really compare."
"An extreme brew, no doubt about it."
"I think with the IBU's so much malt was needed, that it became physically impossible to present an true balance, let alone a definite hop presenece."
"Emptied bottle into oversized wine glass producing a fingers worth of light beige head that receded but never completely. Had a nice glowing orangish amber color to it with carbonation visible and left a fine lace all the way down the glass from the extremely tiny bubbles. Amazing sweet smell of white grape juice and figs. Sweet tastes of honey and maybe a little raisin or fig in there as well. This beer feels like it's just melting in you're mouth with all of the fine carbonation. I didn't even notice the hops at all until the end where I detected a mild hop bitterness. I don't know how they hide the huge amount of alcohol in this, maybe the sweetness masks some of it. Just as awesome as the first time I sampled this one, truly a great beer but not for the faint of heart and to be enjoyed single serving. Still don't understand how they can call this a double IPA it reminds me more of barleywine, I guess I don't care what they call it it's simply just an awesome brew."
"Worth a try, but probably not a regular in the refrigerator."
"Hop special beer. Open it and you can smell it from a mile away, short of a lime/lemon/orange taste right when it hits the pallet. Then the hops hit the mouth and that is all you taste. Think it might be better a bit aged. Interestingly hard to tell that it is a high alcohol beer when you first taste. Definitely worth buying a bottle if you can find it."
"A very nice extreme beer, I may be afraid to try fresh."
"This brew is exceptionally great! It pours thick...much thicker then I was expecting. The smell is of strong citrus smells. I was thinking that this was going to be a hoppy beer with the way it was hopped and the amount of hops uses. However, I was very wrong. This beer is very sweet, and smooth. I would have to say it reminded me of drinking a semi-concentrated grapefruit juice. This beer is definitely a sipping beer. Brandy snifter is a good way to take it all in."
"Very smooth. Very warm going down. The high alcohol content masks the the hoppiness. Wonderful. Most drinkable IPA I've had. As with a lot of Dogfish Head ales it has a wine quality to it. Tastes like fresh cut grass and chardonnay."
"If you ar a hop head, here is your beer from heaven. What an insane brew! I served this one chilled in my Duvel bubbler. Pour a murky burnt orange color that is super dense. Smells of sticky, icky, oily, and floral hops just pulverizing my nostrils. Tastes surprisingly drinkable from the obscene amount of hops with floral oily goodness. The 21% ABV kicks my taste buds and pleasently burned my throat the whole way down."
"D - This is a weird one. On one hand, it smells and tastes great, but it hits very hard. The immediate taste is very good, but the burn and lingering aftertaste make it difficult to finish. Have some water breaks!"
"Notes: Very interesting stuff, and pretty enjoyable. Not something I'd drink often, but I'd definitely try it again."
"D-An interesting experience. A great session brew for any raging alcoholic hophead with a sweet-tooth. Although I enjoyed sampling this one, it's a novelty item. I highly recommend trying it, but with friends, since you really don't want anymore once you're halfway down, and it's not cheap."
"Final thoughts - Very medicinal, like drinking cough syrup. The alcohol was way over the top. Although it was interesting I didn't enjoy this brew at all."
"Now I am a huge DFH fan, the 60 and 90 are two of my favorite brews. This is a once in a while, sipping brew, but could not be drank very often. Tends to kill your palate a bit, but I do enjoy it more than most people."
"D- Good to try once. Too strong for a session beer, and I wouldn't really consider it an IPA at all. Granted, I have tried strong IPAs, but this beer didnt give off a ton of hops to me. It tasted like a Barley wine crossed with Sherry wine. It really does smell like nail polish remover, that being said, MUCH too strong for me."
"This is an extremely sweet beer with a definite alcohol burn from the throat to the stomach, to me the hops were lost in the syrupy sweetness. Unfortunately this is one I doubt I'll hit again."
"How do you really score this? If by drinkability you mean easy to quaff then this is not because of the intensity. On the other hand, as a gustatory experience it is verging on unique."
"I'm a bit put off with how sweet and big the beer is and one is definitely enough (especially with the abv). If the sweetness was toned down a bit this could be a great beer, but my taste buds just took too long to recover from their immersion. It's a unique experience that everyone should try but I won't be purchasing another for quite awhile."
"D: It was a sipper beer that did a tremendous job of packing in a mountain of hops along with an equal volume of sweet malts. It is not a """session""" beer unless one bottle is the definition of a session. I would love to have a cellared bottle of this beer again in about 3-5 years."
"It's mouthfeel was very smooth and the carbonation was light. It's aroma was very overpowering and pungent but the taste and mouthfeel was much more relaxed. A boozy beer but very very good... sips only. I really like it but only once in a while."
"I personally expected a lot from the 120 IPA compared to the 60 and 90...and the more expensive price. The beer was very fruitful and had a very strong sugar tase. Overall i was impressed, but the 90 in my opinion is closer to the retail price to worth aspect."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Very rare and expensive ($10 for a 12 oz bottle), this poured a slightly hazy light auburn with moderate off-white head. It smelled like sugary hops and alcohol. It tasted like honey beer, with very sugary hops and not much else. The flavor was super sweet with a decent amount of bitterness and some alcohol warming in the aftertaste. All that combined makes this very unique, but pretty hard to drink. On the plus side, it did have a smooth texture with very little carbonation. Overall this was a ridiculous beer that would be delicious for those with a huge sweet tooth, but disgusting to anyone else. I'm not entirely sure which category I fall into."
"served at the rehoboth pub, appearance is like a 90 but even looks thicker and more viscous. head is also thicker and more persistent. aroma is also similar to the 90, just bigger. one difference in the bouqet was a vague band-aidy or buttery aspect,and boozy alcohol, which carry through in the taste. huge, sweet malts, huge body, and a sweeter finish than the 90. resiny citric flavors are there in the aroma and taste but overpowered by the huge malts in this one. semi-sweet finish could become cloying after a bit. drinkability? less so due to the huge abv...this is more like an after dinner sipper with dessert or a connecticut shade wrapper cigar."
"Medium body with low carbonation. Warming alcohol. Pretty nice to try."
"Bottom line, this is not what I'd call and Imperial IPA, but whatever it is I love it!"
"Drinkability: Definately a sipper.... but go for it!"
"Great beer, but certainly not an everyday go to."
"Overall a great beer. This is a type of beer that makes DFH the brewery it is. The biggest problem was the $10.99 price tag for one botttle."
"All is not lost though. Get yourself 2 bottles. The first one you can drink by itself and give it a fair chance. (It is good, but I'll stick to the 90). Next take that second bottle along with a bottle of World Wide Stout and mix up the ultimate and most extreme half & half. Enjoy."
"D - This just isn't a very drinkable beer."
"This beer pours an orange color with some brown tints. It has a tall and thick tan colored head that laces the glass really well the whole way down. The aroma is of sweet malts followed by a citrisy hoppy aroma. The taste is good for this kind of beer. It tastes of strong roasted malts followed by big piney and citrusy hop flavor. The alcohol is hidden really well in this beer which is surprising for how big it actually is. The mouthfeel is really good - crisp and smooth and not alot of carbonation which is nice for a beer this big. The drinkability is good and I would definately buy more, but I couldn't have more than one."
"Drinkability is obviously terrible."
"I have never had a whole bottle of this fine elixer to myself untill now. So here goes. A light tan head reaches its peak at about an inch but quickly fades to just a skim. Body is a golden honey amber in color. Nose is lovely and really reminds me of a barlywine. You get hints of phenol spices, fresh citrus, alchol soaked dark fruits and boozy hop character. On first sip you get a very up front spicey alchol induced fuzzy feel all over the mouth. Big notes of citrus rind, rum soaked pears and syrupy sweetness. At 21% alchol this is a bottle best shared but if you have it to yourself sip it all night long. The hop profile is very subdued by the alchol but it is there, mostly on the end of the palate. Bitter feel is mixed with a soft richness that balances nicely. A big beer that has a lot of hype behind it. Worth trying at least once."
"Everytime I have this bad boy, or every few batches at least, it changes. This batch from 1/17/08 is a bit harsher than I remember. Poured into a Bush Noel glass aggressively, very nice tall, 3 finger white head filled with strong hop aromas. Taste was sweet with lots of alcohol in it. I don't remember tasting the alcohol so much in previous batches, but I'm getting it here. Half way through the glass I'm getting the alc in the aroma heavily as the head is gone. Lacing is actually on the glass even with the high alcohol. Very slight 90 minute comparisons, the alcohol is really overpowering taste and smell. Almost done and I think my tongue is dead, I could drink another at this point (though, no need too.) Drinkability got better as I neared the end on this bottle. Maybe all the other ones I've had were aged a few months, this was really harsh starting out, I almost felt like I pushed through this one just cause I've liked it so much in the past, glad I did, got slightly smoother toward the last sip."
"Well, I had been looking forward to experiencing a 120 for some time and finally one came to town. I cleaned my favorite glass, sat down on my favorite chair and poured. The color was a dandy shade of gold with a thin head and little to no lacing. My first sniff reminded me of alcohol and honey. Then the taste, to me, the fine ingredients and brewing were overpowered by the alcohol and sweetness but how do you hide 21.00%. I am sure Dogfish head did their best. The mouth feel was a little thick for my taste. All and all I am glad I had the chance to experience the 120 but one will be plenty. The 60s and 90s are just fine for me."
"Drinkability: I should have mentioned, this is 07's. In my opinion a little better than 06. It goes down VERY slow. A good beer."
"D - A sipper for sure, but very tasty. A touch expensive to drink a lot of, but I would definitely try it again. A good deal more drinkable than many barleywines. Maybe its the hops, but the malt isn't overwhelming. This is hard to rate though as it doesn't really fit into any category including DIPA I think."
"whoa!!! this thing could cause a coma if you are not careful, good thing I only bought this bad boy in a 12 oz. bottle ($8.00) crazy beer, very extreme, took me a while to drink this sucker, very strong, very very high alc. good beer these guys really go all the way with these insane IPA's"
"Good beer to have on a special occasion. Found it a local beer store and took two home. Had one when got home. Not over powering, very drinkable. Waiting to have the other one, it ages well with time. Highly recommend this beer for those who enjoy a well crafted beer."
"I was looking forward to finally trying this beer, but I don't see what all the hype is about. The alcohol is way to strong for this to be an enjoyable beer. I would like to try this after it has been aged for a while and the alcohol mellows out. I would not bother with this beer otherwise."
"Drinkability/Overall: Not at all what I was expecting from this """mother of all IPAs""". Insanely sweet and syrupy like most of DFH's """Super Beers""" (WW Stout, Raison D'Extra). More of a super sweet barleywine or old ale. Where are all the hops?"
"Pours a decent head (about a finger and a half) considering the alcohol percentage. Body is fairly opaque and is orange to amber. Smells lightly of hops, plus some alcohol and malt. Flavor starts off really sweet, then finishes with hoppy notes and a bit of a wine-like quality. Definitely not as hoppy as I was expecting, but that's OK here; the flavors work together pretty well. It seems really smooth, especially given the amount of alcohol in it (there's definitely a nice warming note). Overall, it's not something I'd be likely to get again soon, especially given the price, but it's still decently tasty (though it verges on being too sweet at times)."
"I wound up pouring this out after a few sips... Very disappointed and at 8 bucks a pop, it sucks...."
"As for the drinkability; if you have a good dinner one or two should just be enough for you to enjoy it. Anymore would be over kill. You don't want to be known as the guy who fell asleep as the bar."
"I'm glad I experienced it, but for the price, I'm actually relieved I didn't enjoy it more."
"The flavor is really quite something. Where a level of bitterness was expected, there was the drippy sweetness of overripe fruits. It goes down smoothly, with residual bursts of intensity here and there. This is a very dense beer, in terms of both initial taste and how it sits on the stomach and palate afterward. Therefore, it's not one I'd drink often or in large quantities. This ends up working out just fine, because I can't afford to make a habit of it."
"This is probably one of the best IPAs I've ever had. For as high in alcohol as this beer is, it's drinks quite smoothly. Nothing crazy for an IPA in the color department, but the taste is truly unique. Sweet with a lot of hops. I normally don't like to much sweetness mixed with to much hops, but this beer to me is phenomonal. I have a have several bottles ranging from 2005 to 2007 aging in my cellar. Each time I crack one open it's like a special occasion."
"Serving type: bottle"
"But it is a really beautiful beer and would recommend it to anyone"
"...really a nice surprise all around...just missed this on tap at the map room a month ago - now I'm really sorry that I did."
"Approaching this """extreme""" beer with some respect. Have another bottle that I'm going to age for awhile, as instructed on the label, but couldn't wait any longer to try one. There are very few beers of this magnitude around, which doesn't necessarily make it a great beer, but it's hella fun nonetheless. Pours reddish-brown with a one-finger, thick off-white head. Spotty streaks of lacing are left behind. I'm very surprised that the aroma up front was big on the malts and caramel and not a hop attack. Oddly enough, the alcohol and hops are barely discernible to the nose. Taste of sweet raisins and malts in the beginning, then the hops and alcohol heat kick in toward the end. The caramel sweetness covers up the alcohol heat pretty well, but there is some true bitter complexity to the whole experience. Mouth-feel is rich, almost creamy at times. It's full-bodied and carbonation is decent with some bubbly activity throughout. I'll have say beers like this definitely have their place in the beer world, and it's awesome seeing people experimenting and pushing boundaries. Just think where we'd be if the craft-brew pioneers didn't take some chances along the way? Overall this is not what I expected, but expectations are made to be crushed."
"D: Drinks a lot more like a spirit than a beer, but even at 21% alc./vol., it is surprisingly easy to drink, an drinks of a beer at half that potency. Very interesting and complex."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. The color is that of golden honey, hazy, with about a half inch of head forming. The head quickly disappeared. Smells fruity, like pineapple or raison, also some hops. A little spicy maybe. There seems to be a lot going on. Tastes very sweet and fruity with a hop bite in the end with some alcohol. I can't taste much of the alcohol, but can feel it as it goes down. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and smooth. The carbonation is light. Would be difficult to drink more than one at a sitting. For all the hops in the brew I would expect more of a presence in aroma and taste. Not exactly what I expected, but still a very good beer."
"Obviously, this is not a session beer. Best enjoyed as a celebration or on a special occasion (I got a new job!)--and in that respect, it's great. It's a little over the top, but for what it is, I don't know if Dogfish Head could have done much better."
"I had no idea till I punched up Beeradvocate that this was a 21% abv. It's boozy, but doesn't taste that boozy."
"90 Min IPA on steroids very strong. Head retention was good left lace on the way down. Taste was malty with hops and lots of them a little grapefruit. After taste was plesent and lingered for a min or two. Mouthfeel was thick but carbonation seemed a little lite. Drinkability was good I would buy it again but you have to be carefull this beer is stronger than it tastes."
"The body was definitely heavy on this one. Heavy for a DIPA especially of this size. Would drink again but its pretty expensive."
"D: Too strong to have more than 1, but it's very good!"
"D- Definitely a slow sipper by absolute necessity due to the alcohol by volume and the complexity of the flavors, but this is not a bad thing. The worst thing about this beer is that its price point puts it out of reach as an everyday brew, but for special occasions this is well worth the money."
"Aside from beers that have been sweetened """artificially," this was definitely the sweetest brew I have tried to date. It's understandable why many people (especially hop heads) would dismiss this DIPA as cloying, yet I enjoyed it very much. With the 21% ABV being so incredibly well masked (I have tasted 12% beers that that were hotter than this one) this beer is perfect for enjoying slowly. In fact, if there ever was a hoppy beer made to sip as a wintertime nightcap, it would be this one."
"Very thick, sticky mouthfeel. Definitely full-bodied and actually somewhat reminiscent of schnapps....or maple syrup. In fact, I'm having to grab some water every couple sips. Frankly, this one is just going a little too far... try it for novelty if you get the chance, but don't go too far out of your way."
"D:Obviously a huge fricking beer. People will be suprised that it is not explosive with hops. Definitely a different brew. I love it."
"First off thanks to RickSawyer for the opportunity. Poured into a Tripel Karmeliet chalice. Bottled 10May07. The color is a hazed deep orange/amber topped with a minimal head. Smells of big sweet Belgianesque malts balanced with a hefty amount of spicy hops. First and foremost this beer is a sipper. I was expecting a big """syrup-like""" beer from some of the forum posts. Don't get me wrong the body was very big but very well balanced nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of spicy, piny, juicy hops. This is balanced with a nice malty sweetness and maybe some apricot fruitness too. A good boozey aftertaste tags along in the aftertaste. I will admit that I was hoping for a """hop-bomb""" but considering how much malt went into this beer I am quite pleased with the hop profile. I would certainly enjoy this beer again and would love to try it on-tap poured through a Randall."
"The lower than B ratings are confused - they need to take a second chance and really figure out what is going on with this beer. It is impressive."
"Pours clear red with 3/4""" off white head that leavs sparse lace. Somewhat subtle nose that is moderately malty with resinous pine to citrus hops on the grapefruit side of things. Hint of spice and a little sweet smelling. The taste is big, sweet malt with mildly bitter hops with a decent balance that is a sweet and almost medicinal. It transitions to an aftertaste that is sweet and very medicinal. The mouthfeel is full bodied and very syruppy with a soft carbonation and an alcoholic finish. The bottle says """enjoy now or age for a decade or so.""" The bottled on date was not entirely readable, but appeared to be in 06. My impression is that this is a beer that really needs to age to mellow. The flavor is nearly overpoweringly sweet . Almost like artificial sweetener mixed with cough syrup. I would definitely not buy this again, especially at its very high price. Not sure what everyone sees in this one, and I sort of wonder if I got a bad bottle, but I won't be trying it again to find out. There were no off smells, and it looks good, so I don't think this is the case. I give Dogfish head respect for this attempt. I like big beers, but this is more like a malt wine."
"I was expecting to struggle against this beer, but my palate won the battle. I'm really glad I tried it out. I have nothing else to say expect this: get yours hands on a bottle if you see it. That is unless you hate thick syrupy beers."
"D- This is extremely dangerous at upwards of 20%. Scary good."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber. Little to no head and very soupy on the pour. Nose is of strong hops, sugar, and alxxxohol. Wow!! Taste is very very very sugary. Not as much hop flavor as I was expecting. Very good sugary taste, the hop taste is there but it is not as bitter or obvious as I expected. Defenitely some pine and particularly citrus flavors here though. The most marvelous thing about this brew is that for 21% it goes down riotously smooth. Sugar is plastered on the lips. The mouthfeel is real thick, but not mud. Alcohol heat is present especially in the stomach after the finish, but still is hard to beleive this is 21%. The drinkability is life threatening. This is a good brew from DFH, and truly a unique experience. This is one beer you will not want to drive after. Good beer. Props to DFH. I think this will actually cellar quite nicely."
"Too strong, to sweet and too expensive! Here is a case of extreme brewing that has gone too far, IMO. They probably should have stopped at 90 minutes on the hopping. I just don't find this stuff that drinkable. At DFH pub, they serve it in a brandy snifter. So strong it is just not very refreshing and the hops ratio is so overpowering that it obliterates the palate so that every other IPA you try within the next few hours tastes like a pilsner! Looks fantastic though and smells like heaven. Strangely, I was getting faint vinegar notes in the times I have tasted this beer. I applaud DFH for taking this style to the limit though! Just not for me. 90 Minute through the Randall is my ultimate DFH choice."
"This is one powerful brew. The palate starts with a huge caramel maltiness, oily citric hops, black licorice and a warming alcohol. This is one of the best nightcaps I have ever had."
"Brilliant amber coloring, relatively thin head that dissipates after a short while. Smells of very sharp citrus and pineapple hops. Some honey and candy scents as well. Extremely sweet on the palate, huge alcohol hits immediately (think schnapps). Lots of honey and peach flavors at first, with caramel and candy, followed closely by the huge citrus hop kick. Not overwhelmingly hoppy as would have expected, much more dominant malt sweetness, but still the hops resonate. This beer is every flavor of a great IPA amplified by 10. Alcohol warms the throat and stomach. The mouthfeel is all syrup and slick. Drinkability? Considering the 21%, very. But one bottle is plenty, or better yet, to split with an appreciative (beer-worthy) drinking buddy. A nice, warming dessert beer."
"This is a wonderful beer. It would be hard to rate in terms of drinkability on this one. It is definitely a beer that should be sipped on."
"The hop finish is rich with pine. Not really that hoppy despite the toil of sir hops a lot. I'm brewing a double ipa as I write this review and am salivating at the thought of bathing in this delightful field of dreams."
"I picked up a 12 ounce bottle at Walnut Liquorette (for $13). The color is dark yellow to light orange as it pours into the glass and clear medium orange in the glass with a modest, fluffy head that sticks to the glass, leaving a dense lacing as the beer drains away. The smell is surprisingly sweet and suprisingly mildly hoppy with an earthy background. The mouthfeel is sticky (which I like) and the taste is sugary sweet with a much subtler hoppiness (at first) than I expected. As the beer warms a bit, more hoppiness comes out in the smell and the flavor. But still, this is definitely not in the mold of a CA-style IPA or DIPA (I don't mean that as a complaint, just a comparison). I suppose the hopping is more nuanced, but with my (non-super taster) palate and frame of reference, I'm afraid some of that nuance may be lost on me. For me, the sugary sweetness is most noticeable; and due to it, I couldn't drink a whole lot of this beer in one sitting."
"Bottle with just a bit of age on it -- almost a year (bottled January 2007, opened 1/1/08) -- that I'm comparing to a much newer bottle (two months) from the newest batch of 120. Pours with excellent clarity and a small, yellowish head that fades to a collar on top of a dark amber body with some nice darker-brown """highlights""". The nose is nicely balanced between the hops, which display a fine-grained, metallic grittiness (think 300 sandpaper) and the malts, which give off a honey graham note. On the palate, the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops are far more well-integrated than in younger bottles. Nice fruitiness that's hard to put a name to -- it's halfway between citrus, berry and tropical fruits -- comes out at the mid-palate. The finish sweetens significantly but somehow ends with hop dryness. Mouthfeel is improved with age, but still shows a lot of hotness throughout the palate. It's expected with a 21% ABV beer, but it's still distracting. Overall, 120 is much better with a year of age on it. The flavors play much better together, the sweetness is toned down a bit, and the hop astringency is gone. I would guess that 18 to 24 months would be the perfect age at which to drink this beer."
"D - Obviously with such a high ABV, it would never make for a regular selection...I'd say it fits well as a cocktail-hour beer, as a replacement for a liquor; a beer to be enjoyed over a long period of time."
"I enjoyed this one immensely as a late nightcap."
"D = This is a very good beer, which I look forward to having over time (since I have now stored some away), but with the strong flavors and high ABV, you don't want more than a glass or two at a time, but what a time!"
"On closing any of the people who gave this beer a bad review need to take their balls out of their mom's purse and man up ,this stuff is awesome don't fear it embrace, I will definetly be drinking more when I get back from St. Martin, VI next month ."
"D- Too much alcohol for a session, but a decent dessert beer."
"cheers and thank you lawyer3624"
"Drinkability- Sitting at 21% this brew isnt exactly sessionable, or really drinkable. Its definitely a sipping brew; a sipping brew that you should enjoy with a friend, or six. This isnt exactly my cup of tea but considering the extremes that this beer reaches, its really not that bad. Worth trying but dont expect a whole lot. Im going to try one more of these in my life and its going to be super fresh."
"This is an interesting beer, with extreme flavors all around. It is difficult to finish because of it overbearingness. I would say it is worthy of a one time try."
"The huge, caramel malt backbone really pushes through and navigates its way through a rambunctious hopfield to balance everything out. The bitter hops keep things interesting, as hints of fruits, citrus, and pine try their hardest to assault the palate. The alcohol is masked incredibly well, but you still feel like the beer has some weight behind it (and it does). Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, and not very carbonated. Obviously this is a sipping beer, one to be enjoyed with another (I was fine after splitting a 12oz bottle) and a perfect winter treat."
"D: Not bad tasting at all. I'd suggest sharing a single bottle with at least 1 other person. If I were blind tasting this without even a style given, I'd bet on it being a barleywine instead of a Triple IPA."
"Got this bottle for Christmas from a friend, but I've been cellaring a 4-pack bought in Rehoboth Beach this August. Now that I've got it out of my system, I can let that sit for 5-10 years, if I can contain myself. 90 Minute is smoother, but this brew truly embraces the slogan, """Feel the Burn ... That's the Sickness, AND the Cure.""""
"The drinkability of this batch is great, Prosit MK"
"Still more than I'm really into most of the time, but with a better bottle I see what they were trying to do."
"I would highly recommend any beer lover to try this at least once."
"You know you are drinking a high quality beer when the ABV is 21% and you cannot notice the alcohol. I guess that is why the bottle cap has a Yield sign on it."
"Tried about 1/2 of one of these. I just could not stomach it. It was way to strong for my taste. Thick and syrupy, with very little carbonation. The smell was both sour and sweet, but definitely very earthy and aged-like. The flavors were hard to pick out because the alcohol was so over-powering. I would recommend this beer just to say you've tried it, but not one that I would suggest on a regular basis."
"This is quite a unique beer in itself. It is by far the strongest I have ever tasted. The strength borders a liquor. The taste and color is exceptional, but this beer is definitely a sipping drink. Maybe 2 or 3 on any particular night is plenty for that night. The smell is very sweet, I like the smell of the beer. The mouthfeel is very sweet also. The drinkability is semi difficult because it is a lighter beer that is very strong. I recommend anyone to try this beer at least once."
"Several ounces is enough, especially if you have anything to do the rest of the dya (or the next day)"
"I would buy a six pack and age it 6-10 years before I tried it fresh again."
"D: Almost as if it's too big for it's own good. A noble effort that's just pretty hard to drink."
"Absolutely the best tasting beer I have ever had. It is absolutely the hoppiest beer I have ever had. It walks in at a delicious and deadly 18%+. 36 proof beer. I now see why it costs $10 a bottle. It has to be one of the best large extreme beers there are. Every time I can find 120 I will be grabbing some for the vintage closet."
"Overall I think is a bit too sweet for my tastebuds. I much prefer the 90 minute which i think is the quinnesential IPA."
"I find the 60 and 90 Minute by Dogfish Head to be better beers and more accessible."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a one finger white head. Very nice lacing. Nose is resiny pine, bready and slightly fruity. Taste is dominated by a very robust, sweet malt backbone. Floral hops, though less than I expected from this super-hopped brew. Taste hides the alcohol very well; there's no bite, but a pleasant warmth with each sip. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It's oily and viscous and stays on the palate. I had been dancing around buying this one for some time-- glad I finally did. This is a big beer in all aspects. Though it'd be tough to have more than one in a sitting, I'd gladly have another at a later time."
"Found this for $3 a bottle when I took a trip out to Indiana several months ago. I should have gotten more but already was packing a ton of beer in my checked bag. This is a unique experience and a definite special occasion beer. I remember it being different than this when I had it several years ago, but both times it was good."
"Surprisingly drinkable given the alcohol so BE CAREFUL!"
"Drinkability - Given its specs I was expecting an over the top DIPA but it much more subdued especially its hoppiness. Overall a good beer, not a great beer. Glad I tried it however."
"Nice dark copper to red coloration with a small white head that doesn't stick around too long but any head is worth getting excited about on a beer this potent. The smell is alcohol, hops and sweet malt, under-attenuated sweet malt anyway, in that order, it is more like a liquor than beer, without the hops I wouldn't call it a beer by smell. The taste is very much the same as the smell however I'd call it fairly mild in comparison to some of the other extreme beers that I've had. Sure the alcohol is very noticeable, but it isn't overpowering, the sweetness tends to build but doesn't become cloying and there is enough of a hop presence to keep things in check and balance the sweetness, which is one of the places that World Wide Stout by dogfish fails. Mouthfeel is good rich full warming, peppery due to the alcohol and it leaves a residual sweetness and wine like drying sensation that is quite pleasant. Drinkability is ok but not very good, come on this almost isn't beer, definitely a sipper make sure you have no where to go for a while after you order one of these but worth every penny when sampled on draft, if you've only had it in the bottle, seek it out on tap!"
"All in all an exquisite beer I was glad to procure and delighted to enjoy. The only way to do it justice is to grab one yourself and give it a shot."
"I enjoyed the novelty of trying this beer, but was barely able to finish even half a glass."
"Na Zdravje"
"An intense experience. Definitely one to savour and serve in small amounts. Cloudy golden coloured with a head that fades fast. Intense alcohol and hop aromas that are resinous. The flavour is huge bitter hops - oily and rich with a spike on the back palette. The alcoholic warmth starts deep within the pit of the stomach and travels all the way up to the cheeks. Next time I try it will be in front of a fire with a huge cheese platter."
"Overall a tad better than i expected. I had figured this to be a highly overrated, overhopped, out of balance mess of a beer. Its ot over hopped, it is out of balance but in a good way, I like it, and will probally will keep a couple bottles around to sip on in front of the fire after dinner."
"Drinkability - 100%."
"Mouth feel: A very nice even level of carbonation"
" I'm not sure about this one. It's extremely syrupy and sweet, and the hops kind of get lost in all that malt. Pretty good beer overall, and very well done considering it's strength, but probably not something I'll have again anytime soon."
"Recommended just to say you have tried, strongest IPA you will ever have, be will be able to tell that this boiled for two straight hours based on the strength of its taste"
"D-This is a night cap sipper, maybe even one to share a 12oz bottle. This is a very tasty brew but the alcohol prevents you from drinking more than one. It is basically like drinking a pint glass of liquer. While tasty, this is much more of a novelty than something I would seek out."
"I have vowed to try again. I will be trading for this again soon."
"D- a great beer, however at 9 a 12 oz bottle, not a regular purchase kind of beer, but definitely a great beer"
"Fine stuff, overall. Carry-on, Dogfish!!!!"
"Pours a murky copper color with a medium thin and frothy bone white head that burns off slowly. Spotty lacing. Aroma of piney hops and citrus with some sweet malt. Rich, full body with a thorough underlying malt and sherry sweetness that is somewhat surprising considering the increasing hoppyness of the 60 and 90. Hops are present to be sure, but are masked by the caramel malt and alcohol flavors. The finish is syrupy sweet as well, and by the end of the bottle you can definitely feel the 21% ABV. An enjoyable beer despite not being what was expected, still I doubt I would pay the premium price for another bottle any time soon."
"d: I didn't drop into the 1's because I didn't dump it, though I was tempted. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. There won't be a third time."
"I'm going to have to think twice about buying this again."
"Final Statement: A little too much for me. I wouldn't mind having a shot of this every once and a while to sip on, but not a whole bottle. That does not mean this isn't a fabulous beer and a great achievement."
"Overall, I would recommend this beer - in moderation. seriously."
"At first appearance it had a slightly cloudy amber to caramel color, with a nice head that quickly dispersed and left some lace. The aroma was heavy on caramel and slightly nutty, with a roasted hoppy overtone, tinged by the high alcohol content. The first taste was full, with a sweet caramelly taste and a slight nuttiness. The feel was smooth with a lingering dry touch and rounded sweet aftertaste. As far as overall drinkability, I'd have maybe one more. The alcohol content and full flavor (not to mention cost per bottle) of this beer render it a favorite beer for occasional consumption."
"Much of my opinion has already been discussed in other reviews. Poured nicely, the head not lasting very long. I was unaware of the ABV before diving in. The smell warned me this was dangerous, yet enticing. Overall, I don't know that this is a beer I will be drinking regularly. On the other hand, I definitely recommend it's given a try or two."
"This is a very unique IPA. It doesn't pack as big a hop wallop as many, and it doesn't come with a lot of very easy-to-like citrus flavors, but it is rather likeable nonetheless. Definitely recommended."
"Abosolutely outstanding! Another excursion across into Wisconsin and another great beer. Very malty and silky/syrupy on the palate. Not much head. You definitely notice the alcohol in the taste and even more so once youve finished! I was suprised to find that the hoppiness did not overwhelm this beer but that it was balanced very well."
"already reviewed this one once, but this time i had a one year old aged 120 minute. untill now, i wasn't sure that an iipa could age so well, but the malt profile and the hop profile had both remained outstanding, yet blended ever so sweetly and even become more distinct at the same time. the alcohol was barely noticeable, and the body was top top notch. i'll check back in on this one next year. a real treat."
"Peach/amber color with an off white head that reduces to a sticky lace ring and some surface lace. Very pungent alcohol esters, caramel, pine and pineapple from the nose. Dark roasted malts, prunes, a rich earthiness, and a big sugary sweetness. The hops is very piney with a juicy, tropical fruitiness. The alcohol is its biggest a second or two after swallowed...a nice warming effect and leaves your palate slightly numbed. Mouthfeel is full, somewhat syrupy, and the carbonation is good with a nice great creaminess. The finish is relatively tame, residual fruit flavor with some dry grains and sweetness. Overall rather sweet but I suspect that will adapt with age."
"Recommended"
"Drinkability is very good when your just drinking one every once in awhile, but considering the alcohol it packs I can't give it a higher score. Too bad, because this is a really good brew that I would have loved to be able to drink one after the other. I guess 90 minute will have to do. ( :"
"Drinkability....I liked it....as a special occasion beer....too strong for everyday drinking...but I enjoyed it nonetheless"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark, orange-amber. Sweet aroma. Was not prepared for the first sip, like said by others, WOW, I liked this right away ! Each sip thereafter it just got better and better. Sweet but not annoying sweet, hops dominate with fruity undertones. Alcohol is well hidden, creeps up on ya ! To quote Tommy Chong """It kinda grabs you by the boo-boo!""" Cant wait to try this one again."
"Edit (2008-02-05) - Still love this beer. Rich sweetness and alcohol is still somehow mellowed by the hops. An exceptional 21% beer. That said, I'd guess this is best fresh or with a number of years age on it - anywhere in the middle could become too sweet I would say. But hey, that's just my opinion - so take it as you will."
"M/D: Sticky, thick and full bodied. Drinkability is definately limited by the fullness and ABV. Little carbonation."
"The beer poured a rich caramel color, with a 2 finger head which laced all the way down. VERY hoppy aroma around the beer, and the taste was much the same. A great deal of warmth with the 20%+ ABV and the 100+ IBU's kicked me straight back in my chair. This beer is made for sipping, anyone who chugs this is missing the delecate balance of hoppiness and warmth."
"This beer poured a hazy brown color with a ½ creamy head  nice lacing. The aroma is initially of hops with a subtle sourness perceptible. The taste is definitely strong of hops. There is a balancing sweetness from the malt, but the hops definitely dominate. The finish is quite bitter, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is full and seems appropriate for the beer. I had a preconceived notion that this would be an intensely hoppy brew that was one dimensional. It has a nice amount of malt and is quite enjoyable. (Sometimes it is nice being wrong)."
"Mouthfeel has a creamy character. Very smooth with a boozy character. I really love this beer and want to get more, but I would never take on more than one at a time.. Still, anyone with extras please feel free to send them my way."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy brownish-orange color with a thick white head. Nice lacing. Aroma has more malt than I'd think with a nice citrusy hoppy beers. Excellent mouthfeel. Flavor is strong in alcohol with an orange hint to it. Nice, sweet, and hoppy, but not overpowering. A solid beer."
"It's not something I'll be drinking a lot of, but that's not because I don't like it. The price and availability will make this a specialty brew for me. Perhaps I'll put a few in my cellar and see what happens over time."
"Medium bodied, little carbonation, but creamy and full of texture. However, there is a slight burn from the alcohol. The taste is so amazing, but I couldn't drink this casually, too much to not sit down and savor."
"d - this is a smooth sipper and it makes you want to drink it fast even though it has some heat to it but it's not overwhelming. i like it a lot. i think this could be amazing with 5-10 years of cellaring instead of the 1 i put behind it."
"NOTE: I wish DFH dated their beers; I really think that this one's been sitting for quite a while, because it's nothing like the hot, sickly-sweet mess that other people have described and that I was expecting."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/08/120-minutes-of-pain.html"
"120 Minute IPA pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle that says it was bottled on 3/30/06. Hops and malt are both present in the aroma, as is a bit of fruitiness and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is downright thick. The flavor is very sweet, almost syrupy, followed by alcohol in the end. You can pick up hops and malt in the flavor, but this is not the hop bomb many might imagine. This is a sipper, the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but definitely worth a try."
"The first sip overwhelms with hop flavor then fades into a syrupy sweet malt taste. This is a heavy slow sipping drink. The hop flavor is resiny, piney, and vegetal. The malt is super sweet and smoky. The malt seems to outweigh the hop bitterness in my opinion, leaving this ale a little too sweet. Despite this perceived flaw this is still an excellent beer that any IPA lover should try at least once. The drinkability is low given the extreme flavor and alcohol percent. I would recommend sharing a 12 oz serving between two people. After half of this beer my taste buds felt numb and burnt out. In summary, if you love hops try this beer, if not forget it."
"D: Other than drink 2 of these and you may need a nap, smooth, sweet, tangy and absolutely delicious!!!!"
"Fantastic Pour but the head didn't last too long. Deep amber color and just slightly cloudy. Highly aromatic with hints of raisins, and a slight hint of ethanol. It's suprising how easily it is to drink. The taste is complex without aging and almost flowerful. It finishes with a slight taste of ethanol and alittle warmth when swallowed. Overall a great beer!"
"Considering this is a 21% motherload of a DIPA, it's quite drinkable. I shared my bottle with a friend and we both enjoyed it from the first sip to the last. Not something that I'll be drinking on a daily or even weekly basis. This is one to enjoy on a special occasion and I would also advise you to sip slowly."
"I am already starting to feel a buzz after drinking maybe only 1/8th of the 12ozer. That is 21% for ya..."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer but nothing I could drink on a regular basis. The alcohol wasn't overpowering which is good."
"When I finished up the DFH brewery tour I was ecstatic to be informed by our guide that they would be pouring the 120 Minute for samples. I have a few 12 oz. bottles of the stuff, but I have been reluctant to open them without cellaring for a while. The beer was a dark, tawny orange with a frothy tan head that subsided kind of quickly and smelled of amber and pale malts with a layered hop character. The taste was arresting and beautiful. Caramel-y and hoppy, this is the way a Double IPA should be. It wasn't a brutal and bitter hop slap in the face the way you'd expect something boiled with hops for 2 hours and then dry-hopped for a month to be, the malts came through excellently; it was amazingly well-balanced from the hops and malts to the different varieties of hops in there. Mouthfeel also was exceptional, it was thick and chewy, coating the mouth and smooth going down despite the alcohol content. I could drink so much of this despite how strong it is, it's just... wow"
"all that being said, this is probably just a bit too sweet (even with the dry finish), especially for the style."
"D - It is always hard to give a drinkability rateing to a beer this unreasonably strong, but overall this is a solid beer. Many """extreme""" beers are almost undrinkable in my opinion but this goes down relatively easy, the only fault is the mouthfeel which is syrupy and a bit unpleasant. The high alcohol is kept in check by other flavors and the smell is quite extraordinary. I have to say this is one of the best truely extreme beers that I have had, from Dogfish Head or anyone else."
"Definitely an extreme beer, but a balanced one."
"Final Thoughts: At $10 for a 12oz bottle, I would recommend a buy, but wouldn't make this a regular visitor to my fridge. Definitely prefer the 90 Minute, which has become one of my favorites. Other than price, this beer has nothing going against it."
"But damn it's tasty. This one has been on the shelf for a few months, and I'm sure this sucker ages quite nicely, seeing as its alcohol level could sustain it for years. But I actually prefer the 120 Minute as fresh as possible. I think the piney/citrus notes in the hops stand out more when the beer is fresh. But I highly recommend it either way to fans and self-declared afficiandos of IPAs everywhere. But be warned... this is a BIG beer."
"Drinks good for the abv, but I prefer a more restrained DIPA, at say 1/2 to 1/3rd the ABV. I would say based on my 2 tastings to age at least 3 years"
"Pours murky orange with a nice and tame finger of head. Smells very malty/sweet and alcoholic along with just a hint of hops which is weird for an IPA. VERY sweet tasting with dried fruit, alcohol and I think there might be a little hops but that might be from me expecting a heap of them present in a big bad IPA. Though the alcohol is recockulously high, its not obvious at all. Feels extremely syrupy and thick. Totally not what I was expecting but thats not necessarily bad. A nice treat but I cant imagine drinking more than one at a time. Definitely a must try."
"The appearance was burnt orange with a sticky lacing that hugged the glass leaving little room for a great head. 120 minute had a very sweet and tropical smell while the alcohol was surprisingly not too noticeable for a beer at 20% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The first taste brought a punch of caramel which flowed into a tropical fruit much like a pineapple then finishing quickly with hops. I expected this to be intensely hoppy but it yielded an overpoweringly sweet, thick and syrupy taste and mouthfeel with an astonishing hop balance. This DIPA (Double India Pale Ale) is definitely a sipper; very thick and heavy with little carbonation and high alcohol. Although the price seemed quite steep, one could justify it in ratio (ABV/price) to wine. The 120 minute term refers to the full two hour boil of high-alpha American hops. In addition to the full two hour boil, DFH radically dry-hops the fermenter daily for a month and then ages the brew for another month on whole-leaf hops! Pick one up if you see it."
"Overall, a good brew. Pushes the boundries of beer. A bit too sweet for me to enjoy all the time, but is good as a once in while beer. Paired it with some hot wings and the alcohol cut through the heat of the wings. Very good balance."
"I finally got my hands on this famous/infamous brew while visiting Northern Delaware. I found this beer and WWS at a liquor store across the street from my hotel and promptly releaved the store of their supply of both. The owner was more than happy to sell it all to me since no one else in this neighborhood was buying them. The beer poured a hazy amber/orange color with a rather large half inch head that receded quickly. The aroma was very malty and alcoholic, with the hops hidden in there somewhere. Where are the hops? Taste was hot alcohol, extremely sweet honeyish malts and citrusy hops. The longer I sipped on it though, the hops became overwhelmed by the massive sweetness. I was expecting a hopsmack in the face and instead got kicked in the balls with an un-Godly amount of malt. Mouthfeel was very thick and sticky in the palate. One 12 oz bottle is all I can handle. The combination of extreme sweetness and very hot alcohol makes this one a sipper. I'd be interested to see how this beer changes after several years of aging."
"It's pretty drinkable but I won't be having more than one and I don't know if I'll drink this again, with the exception of an aged bottle perhaps. I keep hoping that one of these 20% abv beers is going to blow me away and become one of my serious go-to beers but thus far they are all just sweet and while they do have redeeming qualities they're not all that great. This is still a very good beer though and it has to be tried."
"Drinkability for me has this as a one-off or occasional beer. I've actually been meaning to pick 2 more up so I can cellar them for a couple years and see how it tastes with age."
"This bottle was 1.75 years old and pretty tasty. The aroma was malty sweet with notes of alcohol and little to no hops. The color was a orange gold. It had a small, tight creamy head. The flavor was bitter for sure with a lot of sweetness. The alcohol is nestled nicely behind the sweetness. I wish it were less sweet so the bitterness and hop flavor could come out to play. I love this beer and its a great sipper after dinner but I want more out of it. I know I am asking a lot since DFH puts so much into it but a man can dream. The most impressive thing about this beer is its smoothness. The mouthfeel is velvety and viscous while the lack of perceived alcohol allows for it to be pretty easy to drink."
"d- With a mouth-dropping abv, it would be hard to drink multiple servings in one session; 120minute reminds me more of a hoppy strong ale than the DIPAs I am used to on the west coast, $30 for a 4pack is quite a pricetag and there isn't much uniqueness here for a return visit; DFH makes some great ales, however, with 60minute and Raison (not reviewed) being big hits on this visit; i would be surprised to see how the 90minute compares to its 60- and 120-minute brethren."
"Overall it's a mighty fine beer, I'll have to pick some bottles up to stash in my cellar."
"Poured gently into a tulip glass. A nice hazy amber, burnt orange color with minimal head and lacing. Very sweet smell, apricot, fig, molasses, earthy hops. I was expecting more hop aroma, but this one leans toward the sweet malt end of the spectrum. Taste is bold, very sweet at first with cherries, hard candy, pineapple, brandy. The hops come in at the finish, with some citrus flavors and just a slight presence of alcohol. Feel is slick and heavy. Viscosity reminiscent of liquor. This is a sipper for sure. The alcohol is well hidden behind the huge sweet malt and heavy hop addition. This is worth a try for its uniqueness and extreme nature."
"--Thanks Sondra!!!"
"Poured into an Imperial IPA glass, pours a dark orange brown with a bit of apple amber red with a serious two finger head that leaves some serious thick heavy lace on the glass. Smell is a very fruity yeasty bread combination with some sweet mollasses in the mix as well and some figs, it has a Belgian type of smell to it. Taste is pretty sweet and impressive not a lot of hop bitterness just sweet raison and clove and also just a hint of alcohol burn, I was actually impressed on how well the alcohol was hidden being it 21%. This is a very different offering and one that I truly enjoyed drinking for it being so strong it actually went down pretty damn smooth and I sure felt smooth after drinking this beast."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for a beer that seems so unbalanced at first taste. The hops and malt balance each other almost perfectly, and it goes down quite nicely."
"Thanks Mike (MDS)."
"Personally I'd rather pay for the 60 or 90 min, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"D: Like most Dogfish beers, this is a very interesting beer and I am glad I tried it but, I don't think I will pick up another of these. In the end, this is just too over the top for me. I like most/all double IPAs but this has too much of a malt backbone."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Good medium bodied mouthfeel with lower carbonation levels give this beer a good mouthfeel. Warms a bit as it goes down. This beer also ends with a bitter taste and feel, making the mouth water, making one want more. The beer is great, I'd definitely drink it again, though at about $8.50 a bottle its a little steep. Sure its good, but I don't think one could drink this all night, if you can and you have the dollars to roll like that more power to you. However, once a person has had two to three of these I think that drinking such an expensive and high class beer would be a waste. I wouldn't want to waste this beer by drinking it when I am drunk, or getting there."
"This is my 500th review. Thank you craft brewers, BA and the rest of the beer community! It has been a pleasure so far! Many more reviews to come on my transfer to the West coast. Hooray beer!!!"
"After first taking on the 120 as a young hop novice years ago, I recently dared to take on the beast at the dogfish head brewery itself. after partaking of randalized 90 min all evening, the 120 was still like that first hit of crack on a cold February morning. The 120 has a tremendous syrupy mouthfeel, backed up by a surprisingly smooth mega-hoppy aroma and flavor."
"Pours a nice clear/clean golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger creamy off-white head, nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet, malty, hoppy, some dark fruit, maybe some caramel. The taste is pretty sweet, malty, nice hoppy effect, some kinda dark fruit going on. Nice sweet after taste with a nice alcohol warming effect in the body. Medium body. Very drinkable, definitely a sipper, I like this one, way to go DFH. I'm glad I have another bottle that I bought."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a laser bottled on date on the label. This one is 6 months old. Poured a copper orange color. Was very hazy with a ton of yeast floating around. It had a good head that slowly settled into a constant film. Good lacing. The aroma was very hoppy as expected but shared the limelight with a heavy sweet syrupy smell. Could tell from the smell that it was gonna be too sweet and I was right. Expected an insanely hopped ADIPA and instead get a overly sweet syrup with some hops in the back. It's a mess and not very enjoyable. Love ADIPA's lately but hated this one. (2, NA, ML, N)"
"Dangerously drinkable! This one was bottled just over a month ago, and is much hoppier than I remember the last one I had, which must have been quite aged. This one is quite hoppy, but very balanced with the sweetness and the alcohol. I am stocking up on this batch!"
"**note, i finished this beer in about 45 mins, and feel fine. more a point that (in my opinion) you can enjoy without worry of getting hammered"
"O - worth trying at least once just to say you did."
"Pours a cloudy blood-orange color a smallish off-white head, not much lacing detected. The smell is wonderful, a clean citrus/grapefruite scent. Big, bold, and juicy. The taste is of citrus, grapefruit hop, sugary sweet like orange soda concentrate. I prefer my IPAs to be a bit on the bitter side. The feel is well carbonated and slickly sweet. Definitely a BIG BEER, but goes overboard. Too much sweetness kills the hop flavors."
"12 ounce bottle with a bottled on date of 3/30/2006. Served in a Dogfish Head snifter, the 120 Minute IPA pours an amber/red color with a very small white head. It smells like citrus and pine hops, caramel and a bit of brandy. The taste starts off very sweet and finishes slightly bitter. I can taste hops (both pine and citrus), caramel, apricots, brandy, and some spices. The alcohol is very well hidden considering it's 21% ABV, and it does pack a punch later. Mouthfeel is full, syrupy and oily. Drinkability is good, although this is definitely a sipping beer. It's nice and smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think this is a well balanced brew. It wasn't quite what I was expecting but in this case it's a good thing. If you get the chance to try one, you should. It's a very good beer."
"One month later and I had another bottle from the same 4 pack. It is already much smoother. The malt is actually more prominent than the hops. Candied fruits, sugars are up front now. This reminds me of a barley wine much more than it does a DIPA."
"D: Very easy to drink for such a huge beer. However, it's a sipper for sure. Something to have on a special occasion. Great on a cold, rainy day. If I had the money I'd buy a bunch of these and age them for a few years."
"Drinkability - this is good, but it's definitely not sessionable owing to the very high abv."
"Good sipping drinkability, definitely not a session beer."
"Definitely a beer to sip and savor. And savor it you will. One on my all time favorites. A must try."
"DFH, please get California distribution!!"
"As for drinkabilty, what can I possibly compare this to?? It's a +20% ABV IPA, so of course it's a really slow sipper. Nevertheless, the 120min IPA is a beer drinking experience like no other. Over all it's really nice, although it gets a little rough on the belly by then end."
"This beer is a hell of an experience. Perhaps the most accessible high ABV brews out there - definitely not for the faint of heart. It still takes me an hour and a half to finish one, but I appreciate every sip."
"for a beer with such a reputation I was thinking this wouldn't live up to the hype but it did! The hops were very tasty and it went down nice and smooth. I had a bottle from 2005, got it in 2006 and opened in 2007. Definitely worth the wait. Considering the thickness of it I was surprised at how sweet it tasted and how smooth it was overall. Check it out!"
"Don't drink and review."
"If you like strong beers, you need to have 120 Minute IPA."
"Bottled 12/18/06. It pours with authority, a hefty sound and reasonable head that quickly dissipates to an even, thin blanket of white. The aroma starts strong with a bitterness suggesting grapefruit, very crisp. Give it a little longer and there's a hint of sweetness, cherry perhaps. The appearance is a beautiful golden brown with plenty of floating goodies suspended evenly throughout. The first roll onto the tongue is startlingly thick and sweet. Tangy at the tip of the tongue and a heavy apricot rolls to the back of your mouth. This is strong stuff and proves itself quickly as it warms its way to your belly. By the third or fourth swallow you feel like your mouth has been converted to a new level of thinking and the dark cherry bitter-sweetness reveals itself with authority. This is obviously quality stuff but probably a bit too much ale for my palate. It stays tasteful at the front but overwhelms me a bit at the finish. I added a little mild cheddar cheese to this taste experience which was a nice pairing, but for me this definitely demands thoughtful sipping. It definitely holds its carbonation as ten minutes into this glass the head looks as good as it did a minute after the pour and the bubles still sizzle on the tongue. There is some degree of an oak overtone here as the flavor matures over the long haul. But this is still some strong stuff, I imagine somewhat an acquired taste for most. Taking it slowly I found that as it went closer to room temperature it seemed a bit tamer to the tongue, more manageable so to speak. I will need to try this again, hard for me to rate as a relative neophyte. But it is quite a taste sensation and a heavy brew to ponder! This won't be my favorite Dogfish brew but I have good faith that it is another quality offering for those fans of this variety. However you shake it, it is impressive. Thanks to DH for the experience!"
"Bottle into pint glass. A: Very hazy amber/copper, moderate amount of head that retains well. S: After sampling the 90 minute IPA, I was expecting a more aggresive smell. Very sweet, a lot of hops but nothing overly aggressive. Pine, some citrus. T: Very, very, very sweet up front with the hops kicking in shortly after. Pretty well balanced for something this strong. A lot going on here: pine, citrus, dark fruit, earth. M: Thick, moderate carbonation. D: I've kept my eye out for this beer for a while now, I was expecting something very bitter and I got something very sweet. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, so good that I didn't mind paying $9.99 for a single 12oz bottle at Marty's Liquors in Allston (is it normally this expensive?). For obvious reasons, I think the 90 minute IPA is much more drinkable, but with a 21% abv it doesn't get much more drinkable than this."
"This ones an orange-hued liquid, with a puffy head. It doesnt look like a beverage of its strengthits somewhat unassuming from the outside. The aroma is reminiscent of fresh hops. Theres a little fruit as well, and lots of pine, grapefruit, flowers, and herbs. Its a heady smell for sure. Surprisingly, the smell doesnt broadcast the alcohol as Id expect. The taste is sweet, yet balanced. Theres a lot of everything, but nothing is truly overwhelming. Theres a bit of warming, and you do feel the alcohol after a bit, but its taste is folded into the flavor of the beer. Fairly smooth, the beer is moderately heavy. There is no doubt that this beer is well made. Its too strong for regular consumption, but its a great beer."
"Overall, I enjoy it. It beats out the DIPA that I've tried from Magic Hat, which is the only other DIPA I've had anyway."
"The abv. is certainly still noticeable, and there's no way you can drink a lot of this (who'd want to) or drink it too quickly. Definitely a sipper... and a beer where the abv. becomes increasingly noticeable as it warms and sits in the glass. Still, an excellent beer. Very, very impressive..."
"wonderfull bring, when the 240min IPA"
"D: This is a ginormous beer. Theyve avoided it being too syrupy, which is surprising for the alcohol content. Definitely worth checking out. I wish I had a guaranteed fresh bottle to sample."
"I would not want to drink two or three of these, the high ABV would hurt anyone, but overall a great beer. One of those sipping on Sunday, cooking out beers to enjoy slowly. Being the hophead I am, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of over the top hops, which is what I have come to expect from American IPAs and IIPAs. Having not tried a fresher vintage, I have nothing to compare the 2003 vintage to, but this is an amazing beer....well done, Sam!"
"I am aging some 2005 vintage in my fridge still. I'll start opening one a year in a year or so. Counting the days..."
"poured from bottle to tulip pint. murky red-orange color with a significant amount of head that dissipates with some lacing. the smell is a highlight-- floral hop edge and a lot of grapefruit. to say the taste is intense is quite an understatement. the hops so proudly boasted by the bottle (up front) are almost overshadowed by the taste of citrus juice concentrate. the sweetness is definitely overdone. ends in nice warming of alcohol. feels like syrup on the mouth and leaves a formidable after-taste. with the heavy sweetness paired with the alcohol content, one was quite enough for me. worth the experience, but not the cost."
"Received two bottles of the 120 in a trade with zutmin. Cellared one and tried the other out tonight. Expectations were met, if not exceeded. Nice orange hue with a half inch head. Smells of fresh hops, fruit, candy. Taste the same, with a nice grape-citrus finish. Though alcohol was apparent, the hops balanced it out. Definitely can tell this is the highest gravity beer I tried after the first half of glass. Easy enough to finish and really enjoyed every ounce. Not for everyone, but my palate is finally to the point to appreciate this. Another hit by Dogfish head."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and smooth, easy down the throat and taking the obligatory back seat to a phenomenal flavor profile. This beer has provided an unforgettable tasting that I'm extremely thankful for, and I must give Andy's Corner Bar in Bogota another round of applause for having this on tap three years ago where I made the decision to grab one for the road. And DFH, way to go... this one certainly stood the test of time."
"Wow, the drinkability really surprised me here. It was a sipper, but a fine one for the alcohol. I guess its had some time to mellow, but still. The boozey flavors were very low with estery malts and and fruit punch hops flavor. I remarked to a friend that it tasted like """hops candy.""" Its not the richest or most complex beer, but its good and its different."
"I know that a lot of people say that this beer is overkill, but i wish that they would make a 150 min IPA because I think that it was a little bit too easy to drink!"
""
"For a 21% alcohol beer it's not that hard to drink, but the extreme thickness and sweetness of the malt make drinking more than a couple of these a chore."
"D: For its strength this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. Given the ABV I was expecting something closer to a scotch or whiskey, but the balance of alcohol to the rest of the drink was about on par with wine. Although this is a quite bitter beer I would probably serve this with a dessert because the fruity sweet flavor seems to strike me more. Not something I would drink regularly, but certainly worthwhile to pull out for a special occasion, or if I can find a good food match."
"I can't imagine going to a bar and ordering this and enjoying it. Perhaps if global warming were actually real and I needed to hide from the impending ice age I would drink this to warm me up. Since global warming isn't real, I guess I will never have to drink another one again."
"Drinkability? Well... one and done for sure with this beast. But this is a special beer, and I am really glad I got to try it. I was skeptical about aging this at first... (I prefer double IPAs fresh) But this isn't really a double IPA. It's really more like a super alcohol hop charged barleywine. I think the other bottle is going to sit for a while. I also think this will stay on my wants list. Well done Dogfish Head!"
"The color was an orange/amber with a big fluffy white head. color: mango,pinapple,oranges. The taste: big fruity,high acidity,strong alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel was thick and silky. This brew drinks like a well aged barley wine. My freind gave me this one sample I wish I had one more to try. This beer is very complex and I need more time to pick out more flavors. I'ts huge pollen season down here in GA. and it's kinda hard to breathe!"
"The beer is quite complex and rather drinkable considering the ABV."
"A definite sipper. Flavors are intensely sweet tropical candy and alcohol with a lot of pine oils that sort of stick to your tongue."
"Drinkability for a beer like this should be considered relative to similar beers. I doubt another 21% beer with such insane hoppiness could be made to be as luscious and enjoyable as this. And no significant weaknesses either. In a league of its own...one of the best freakin' beers in the world."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is pretty heavy and syrupy. I'm sipping it. Due to the 21% abv, I'd be extremely hard pressed to drink more than one. Drinkability is extremely limited. Overall, it's a good beer. Definitely extreme and pushing the envelope. Recommended."
"D: An amazingly smooth and tasty sipping beer. In a blind tasting, there is no way I would pick this as having an ABV of 21%. I need more."
"Waaallll smack me down, this here is one serious beer. Poured with a small head and some lace. Has a clear orangish amber color. Nose is hoppy, fruity, honey, malty, and sweet. Flavor is all of that and more of the very ripe fruit, yeasty, and big honey. Alcohol is definitely there, but not as noticeable as the actual strength would suggest. Looong sweet finish. Big beer."
"Pours out quite clear with a golden hue. Not much head to speak of- lacing was decent but thats about it. The nose is sweet with minor hops in the background. Taste is in a nut shell- lapping up lquid malt extract. Holy shit that's sweet! Boozy, huge caramel malts with some breadiness with a hint o' hops in the background trying to sneak through. Given that this is four years old, I think I would prefer a fresher version that has more hop presence. The sweet malts are just too much in the aged bottle. There is some bitterness on the tail end which helps the finish of this beer immensely. The hops that are there lend more of a resiny quality than anything else, but given the age I was expecting a hop aroma bomb. I am very happy I had a chance to try this monster and if given the chance would love to try a fresh bottle."
"Thick, syrupy mouthfeel but the good carbonation keeps it pretty drinkable. Hides the huge alcoholic strength very well. Probably not as good as the 90 min, but certainly more unique and worth a try."
"Pours a rich clear orange color with a thin head of tan bubbles. Aroma is of apricots with a hint of grass. Taste consists of apricots and pear with a pleasant bitterness cutting through the thick sweet mouthfeel. Sticky sweetness cut with a tinge of bitterness coats the mouth in the aftertaste. Wonderful. Age has done this beer some good. I love it fresh, but with a few years on it, it takes on a very smooth barlywine character. Never would guess it is @20% abv until you are drunk after one."
"I would truely drink alot of these beers for some reason, the taste makes it very easy to drink and you kinda forget about the 21% in it after a while."
"This is unlike any IPA that I have had the chance to enjoy. It will definitely need some time in the cellar to mature. The alcohol sweetness is a little overwhelming. Definitely a sipper."
"Shockingly easy to drink for the high ABV. Not for everyday but definitly worth drinking every so often."
"More orange in color and suprising amount of pinapple in the nose. Excellent head retention as well as a modest to decent amount of lace. First time I've ever had it and went right out the next week and procured some for home. Definitely NOT a beginner beer!"
"Don't get me wrong. This is much more like a liqueur than a beer. But if I had to drink liqueur instead of beer, sign me up for this one! I think I appreciate this beer for what it is now, rather than trying to cram it into the IPA category. This beer is in a class by itself."
"Easy to sip and that's what you best do with this one...the ultra sweetness helps make it a sipper. Big @$$ gnarly ale here...go easy on it."
"I could drink this all night if the ABV was lower."
"Wow, split this bottle amongst several friends at a poker game. Smell was not indicative of what was to come. Yellow-orange in color and had a good head. The taste was syrupy, sweet and woody/smoky which I thought very odd. This bottle was cellared for a year prior to consumption. this one was just way too big for me."
"Alcohol is hidden terrificly considering the ABV. Piney, piney, piney. RS is high in this beer but it fits well. Thick with a candied malt that fills the mid palate out nicely. Finish is moderate and sweet. Overall a great beer that hides the alcohol nicely. Not sure how drinkable this is however. Definitely a sipper."
" My last review was simply not on the mark, I called it horseradish. I stand corrected and I sincerely apologize to the brew makers of this ale. I want to keep this review g rated, but I have to state, this beer is orgasmic."
"I'm not even sure what to say, or how to describe, the beer has overwhelmed me. Dangerously quaffable. Everything is so balanced, it's incredible! I couldn't of imagined this being so balanced AND so tasty! Even at 20% or so percent this still drinks like a beer. Far and away my favourite of the series..."
"A good try, but I'll stick with the 60/90 ipa"
"obviously this beer is over the top, but i'm pleasantly suprised at how good it is. the bottle says it ages well, so i'd be curious to try one that has some age on it. damn good even fresh."
"This review is from a 2005 vintage."
"120 minute IPA is an interesting beer. The appearance is an interesting apricot color with a thin white head. Smell is of piny hops and carmely malt, and of course alcohol. THe taste is heavy on the hops at first, but that quickly fades to a touch of malt and finally alcohol burn. the hops reappear on the finish with a wierd sweet alcohol taste. It's good., but a but out of balance. The mouthfeel was good and heavy, but the drinkibility was very low. You're not going to have more than one glass of this."
"For me, the 120 Minute just gets worse as you drink it. I think it would best be served in 4 oz. servings. Possibly in a small snifter as an after dinner drink. A truly overwhelming brew, but one that I believe would be better off if it was toned down a bit. But I guess that is what the 90 Min IPA is for..."
"Drinkability - Consumption, yes. Store, heck yes! This will be a staple in my cellar if I can find more."
"The flavor is rediculous. It tore up my mouth, almost undrinkably bitter, but that just spurred me on. A whole new level of hops, and of beer for that matter. Warming is not the word, this keep my whole house warm last night.As it warmed alot of complex and sweet flavors came to the front, but the most again was a sort of pine sap flavor. The finish was a huge deep dry finish. This is an amazing beer, just huge hops, alcohol is obviously a factor, but if you limit yourself to one, I don't see it affecting the drinkability. I actually re loved this, and would love to try it again. Nothing but really positives on this one."
"Notes: Really unexpected IMO, so well balanced, not just out of control hops, really enjoyable. Might make my Christmas Eve lineup for 07."
"The Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The """Holy Grail""" for hopheads. This 20% """imperial""" IPA certainly pushes even the most avid beer lover's perception of beer. It falls right in line with the rest of the Dogfish Head beers adorned with the CAUTION Dogfish Head exclamation point, daring the drinker to crack it open. On this occasion, I have had the privilege to open my 2006 vintage alongside my friend's 2003. It pours into my Dogfish Head Raison D'etre oversized wine goblet with pale golden amber body. At 20% ABV, one would expect no head at all but the head surprisingly erupts from the 2006 version whereas the 2003's head barley creates a film. The head of the 2006 leaves a nice film over the beer the whole way down leaving lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is almost nothing but malty sweetness, however this is also surrounded by notes of alcohol and citrusy hops. The taste is up front with the sweetness, followed by the alcohol, and finished with the bitterness and flavor from the hops, but the sweetness dominates over all. The 2003 is certainly sweeter. The beer exhibits more than a full body with an extreme amount of dryness on the finish and surprising lively amount of carbonation. In the end, the Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA is a very interesting beer. The warming sensations it brings can make it one of the most enjoyable beers on a cold winters night. However, its not an every night or even every week beer for that matter. If you are looking for that truly extreme beer though, this is the one you are looking for."
"I can see how this beer would be interesting to age. The second I saw it I knew I had to, at least, try it. To me this is a novelty beer, it's a caracature of itself. No one really needs this much hop. I do love the 60' and 90' ales. But this is a beer to age and see what happens. Hazy amber. Very Tacky palate. takes quite a while to adjust. I'd like to meet the guy who could drink a 6 pack of these. It's a sipper, I could only do one a night probably. I'd rather have a sixer of 60' and drink all day..."
"Drinkability: A very complex brew in my opinion. Huge alcohol is pleasant, but does mask the rest of the beer. It looks great, and I would drink this as an aperitif."
"Definetly a sipper here. pours a dark orange brown color. Smells a bit odd like oil and hops. tastes a lot bette though, you do need a lot of hops to overcome the sickly sweetness that is in here, and it is in there. Slick mouthfeel a bit thick but not bad. Overall, everyone should try this at least once. A bit pricey for a regular size bottle but it's good. High alcohol is hidden in the flavors, it works well."
"Drinkability: Once this beer warmed very drinkable. The alcohol is hidden very very very well and i enjoyed this beer alot. I just wish it wasn't so damned expensive"
"I am really impressed with this ale; very unique, creative, complex and inviting. I'd love to set a number of them aside and tap into them yearly to explore aging...but alas I'm afraid that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a trappist glass. Beautiful color, very little head.Pleasent fruity aroma. Very little bitterness. I taste the slightest little bit of a smoky flavor. I wouldn't be able to tell that this beer is 21% abv. It drinks so smooth. Very highly recommended. Yeah, it'll run you $8 - 9, but it's worth it. If you've ever heard the hype about this beer, believe it. This is one reason why American Double IPA is my favorite type of beer."
"Finally the alleged Holy Grail of DIPA arrives in my store. Poured into an over-sized wine glass the beer looked a impressive murky copper. A small head quickly reduced to a thin cap. Definitely some particles floating about. Sparce lacing. Smell is an ether hop blast that lingers. Initial taste is hops and quickly is over powered by alcohol. There are sweet citrus tones as well, but almost everything gets over powered by the booze, which isn't even a bad thing with this beer. I tasted this beer with any surface it met in my mouth. Which left a very nice 'full' mouthfeel. It quickly dries and lingers on the cheeks and throat. I would'nt think off trying more than one of these. None the less a great experience and tasty beer."
"I have since tried the 90 Minute version, and prefer it infinitely."
"A big ABV effort from DFH that blows me away!"
"Notes - Great for a special occasion, with its high alcohol content and price. I may have one again down the road, but I don't anticipate this being a regular purchase. A must try beer."
"12oz brown bottle from Florian's. Slightly hazy translucent red-orange body with a thin film of off-white head. Smells strongly of citrus hops. Tastes much more hoppy than I remember it being. A fair bit of caramel malt to support all those hops, but definitely more hoppy than malty. Some alcohol present, but more noticeable as alcohol warming than flavor really. Medium, syrupy mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper. Better than I remember."
"Wonderful orange/ golden color. Intense aroma of hops and alcohol soaked fruit. Flavors of hops, alcohol and marmalade dominate. Sweet finish with lots of warming alcohol. Honestly, I'm not sure I have a need for this beer once I tried it a couple times. Certainly worth a try, but it is more of a liability to have around, as I need to make sure I have a couple friends to share it with to guard against sudden inebriation. It's like having a really irresponsible friend that you have to make all sorts of preparations for before he can come over to your house."
"I've been ageing this one for about two years. Pours a hazy amber with almost no head. There was quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is citrusy hops and sweet malts. Tastes a lot better than it did fresh, lots of hop flavor, malts and alcohol.Full bodied, This has developed into a good beer, fresh it was nothing but sweetness, bitterness and alcohol burn. Well worth the wait..."
" This is one of the most full-bodied beers I have ever tasted. It is not ready to drink at this point, but will benefit from age. This is the Chateau Latour of beers... It may be expensive, but it will be worth the pricde in the long run... Drink at least three years from the date it is bottled..."
"A sipping beer, for sure."
"I'm sold. This is not a six-pack session beer, understandably -- six of these will buy you more than a case of most craft beers, and put a few martinis' worth of alcohol in your gut. But it certainly tastes good."
"I'd have this again but save it for special occasions."
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into 2 short glasses to be split with my girlfriend. It pours a deep amber color with a slight haze (maybe because it was in the fridge for a while). There is really no head and the carbonation is so little that you have to wait for a bubble to rise every couple of seconds. The smell is rich with an appely-grapey tang to it. You can smell the sweetness synonymous with an American Double IPA and strangely, no alcohol smell is present. The taste is rich, woody, sweet, creamy, and bitter towards the end. It is very fruity and rich. The mouthfeel is thick, syrupy and a little buttery before the bitterness hits. I thought it was going to be hard to drink this one, but it is as smooth as silk. Wow, this is good craftsmanship."
"D - Let this beast of a delight age.... for a while. Granted you'll loose the hop flavors, but man alive this beer is good. Sam, your one of the best."
"Well, this is well-hopped and alcoholic. It's nice, but alcohol does disturb drinkability, and even enjoyment to a degree because it kills quite a bit of the aftertaste. A nice DIPA, but I can't say I liked it more than the 90 minute. It states on label """ages well""". I do suggest cellaring it a few years to see if it mellows some, as it does have good potential."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with a whitish head. Slow rising beads of carbonation from all angles of the glass. Some lacing is left behind as it warms. Initial nose has grapefruit and pineapple juice smells. Some burning alcohol present if you inhale deep enough. Upfront taste is very sweet followed by an alcoholic burn. I imagine it's hard to hide 21% ABV. Looking for the bitterness here. Can pick up a piney hop taste if the swig in mouth is kind of for lack of a better word, """chuffed""" around. If cellaring this mellows the hops, then I believe you want this as fresh as possible. Heavy mouthfeel and oily. Hardly any carbonation in mouthfeel. Overall drinkable if you can handle the sweetness. I respect DFH here for continuing to brew such an extreme beer season after season and may keep this around for years to come."
"Mouthfeel: Light bubbly carbonation and surprisingly light body. Being as strong as it is I would think it would be syrupy, but its not."
"Nice to have tried it, but moving on."
"this does for DIPAs as world wide stout does for double stouts. a very inventive take on an already great style. though, to be fair, i don't think im ever going to go back to either. glad i tried them both, but, yeah, ill stick to more traditional beers."
"Send me this beer anytime !!"
"Overall: At 20-21% possibly the highest ABV of any beer I've ever had, and definitey the most bitter. Still, very drinkable, doesn't taste like it should be so high in alcohol. If you're not sure about how much hops you can handle, start with the 60-minute, then the 90-minute. If you enjoy both of those give this one a shot. Be advised, it's VERY hoppy and bitter."
"Poured from a 12 ounce into a pint glass. Comes out a hazy copper with a rocky, tall head. Smells of lots of hops. Tastes - wow. Lots of hops, but sweet and complex. There's a flavor like molasses or something. I don't like hoppy beers, and this is great. Feels thick and smooth on the tongue, hops and sweet all the way down. It's a tad bitter and rich to drink all night, but I could have a Couple."
"Overall I am glad for having tried this beer. Hell, it inspired me enough to finally sit down and write my first beer review after years of lurking on BA. If it happened to find its way back to Peoria I would probably do what I could to get another bottle, but realistically it's not something that could be considered a staple of any one's """beer diet", readily available or not. I must give a shout-out to BA MWalters for the heads-up on this one. Thanks-a-million!"
"Took this one out of the fridge about 2 hours ago to let it warm up a little. Poured into my favorite glass. Big white head on this cloudy amber/gold beer. Very sweet malty flavor. Much more than I expected, and the first drink went down like a shot with the high ABV%. The hops came through mostly in the aftertaste. Smells a little malty, but I could smell more hops than I could taste. Nice mouthfeel. Light/medium carbonation, medium full body. For me, this is not very drinkable because I could only drink it in limited quantities. It's also too sweet for my taste. Perhaps I could acquire a taste for this one over time, but at $8/bottle that probably won't happen anytime soon because there are so many more beers I still need to taste."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. At 23% this is by far the strongest beer I've ever tried. As a hophead, I'd been wanting to try this for a while. Took a whiff of the aroma and WHOA! Hops galore. As expected, the hops come in strong in the taste, but they cannot overcome the medicine syrup qualities that all that alcohol creates. I'm glad I tried it, but it really wasn't for me."
"120 is great overall but a bit pricy for the 12oz sample I got. I suppose this is understandable due to the limited number of batches per year."
" beware this is a bad boy, sit back at home relax and write a review."
"In summary, this is simply one beast of a beer. It could be an exceptional, legendary beer if the sugar was toned down somewhat. It might already be legendary."
"Notes: In my IPA circles this beer is legendary. The 90-minute style has its points. But Wow this 120-minute version will knock your socks off! But only just one!"
"Cheers."
"D - You know what? Were it not for the price tag and the fact that the pub quiz was over, I could have ordered another. While it's a definite sipper, the high alcohol content really doesn't make this as stand-alone as you'd expect it to. I enjoyed and could quite happile enjoy another!"
"-Oelergud"
"Notes: Interesting. On one hand I liked the over the top expirimental approach but on the other more sane hand I found it to be nothing I would purchase again under normal circumstances. Very expensive."
"Pours a light amber color with a massive bright white head that just keeps growing and growing, the lace on this beer is incredible it coats the entire glass. Gorgeous looking beer. Not too many different smells from this one, not surprisingly a huge hop scent, not a whole lot of malty smells and just a bit of grapefruit coming through. The taste is the definition of hops wow, I thought ruination was a bitter beer, this takes the cake so far. Its also got tastes of sweetness and a very small hint of citrus. It definitely hides the 21% ABV very well. I should clarify that last sentence, the alcohol is definitely present and detectable however for 21% it's not that bad. Great beer, but very expensive, once to treat myself to every now and again"
"I was debating what to get at the liquor store last night, and decided a 12 ounce bottle of this would make things a little bit easier. It poured a bright orange color with no real head. Smell was of juicy hops, and also a certain herb presence. If you've had Stone's 10th Anniversary Ale, there is a certain onion/garlic presence, which was also present in this beer. Taste was really sweet and juicy, almost too sweet. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with the alcohol really making itself known. One is more then enough for me. DFH prides themselves on making high gravity beers that don't taste like hard liquor, but in this case, you really can taste the alcohol. Not a bad beer at all, but it will probably be a little while before I decide to pick it up again. Cheers."
"Looks an orangy/copper color with no head. Very viscous! Smell is heavy on ethanol and hops, maybe some hints of sweet fruits if you smell long enough. Taste is super syrupy sweet alcohol; warms the throat. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Interesting and unique, but not very drinkable at all."
"DI like it, pricey, so maybe once a year will do it. I would have it again for sure."
"Too sweet, but the alcohol is amazingly well masked. I thought it would be a chore to drink, but it's light and refreshing."
"Huge beer, still retains decent drinkability. Overall, a very complex beer and a nice experience. Definitely limited to a single bottle because of the ABV and the sweetness. Again, I really don't see how this is a DIPA. It more closely fits the characteristics of a barleywine, or maybe even a double barleywine considering the extreme nature of this beast."
"drinkability: still an enjoyable sipper."
"Drinkability: I love it. I could have more than one of these in a sitting if I could afford to. Not a session beer but certainly worth trying. It would also be nice to have a few of these around if the mood strikes you to have the experience. Perhaps beer like this could find its way onto Scotch & Brandy lists in finer restaurants. I certainly think it is complex enough and could easily serve as a digestif."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable. Being a standout, incredibly ramped up DIPA this is no session beer but definitely something I could sip all evening long. Now if only we could do something about that $10 price tag."
"Wow- mindblowing D-IPA. Poured a cloudy gold as a good IPA should, with little head and lacing effect. Slick piney hop aromatics controlled the nose- the sharp burning on the first sip was masked only by the fruity apricot- peachiness of the crazy malt profile. An uppercut of hops on the finish- smooth and biting at the same time- great brew but keep it to 1 or 2 bottles or you may not wake up."
"Final verdict: This is an extreme beer, and as such, I can respect it for what it is. It's way to sweet for my palate, and even though I don't find the sweetness awkward or cloying, it's just too much sugar. Also, I wanted a much more brazen, out of control hop bomb, and this to me is more like a barleywine. All that said, wow, I'm buzzed, and I still have half a glass to go."
"Drinkability is exceptional and if it wasnt for the 21Abv I could drink this beer all night. I personaly like it better than the 90 min IPA for dogfish."
"I am not personally a huge hophead and this beer proves it. If you are however, I would say dive in. I wouldn't drink this with a meal as the meal would be completely overshadowed by it."
"This actually was not bad, especially considering it is 21% abv, but just much stronger than I normally care for in a beer. The next time I think about having a DFH 120, Ill just move right to the Everclear instead."
"I like the oily, thick texture of this beer. The carbonation breaks it up well, and I was genuinely surprised by the level of carbonation. With the ABV up around 20%, I was thinking carbonation would be more like a barleywine. My 6 oz was really hard to get down as it warmed. The alcohol and sweetness is a bit too much (and I like scotch clean). Maybe I should consider style with my drinkability rating, but it truly was hard to finish off. A super slow sipper. I couldn't imagine trying to drink 12 oz of this. Definitely worth a try if you spot it."
"Probably one of the most extreme beers you will find. Sip this one slowly and perhaps share the 12oz bottle with a friend. A 60 or 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head will probably be more enjoyable, but you need to try this one just to say you did it."
"Drinkability: Riiight. One and done. GREAT evening sipper, however."
"Not a great DIPA, but this is really in a different category entirely. And for what it is, it's good, but not stellar."
"Honestly, I'd rather have a DFH 90 minute that isn't as high on the ABV."
"If you have never had it give it a try but if you don LOVE hops it is not for you"
"IF I consider this a Barleywine instead of an I2PA, I have to say that I like the Immort-Ale by DFH better (especially for desert)."
"A great offering int he style. Great beer to enjoy with a burger topped with pepper jack cheese. This one is not for the faint of heart. A monster alcohol taste would turn a lot of people away."
"All in all it was worth the $8 I spent on it. It is a very neat beer, well executed, and I have enjoyed it. Actually, I'm glad it doesn't cost less. If I could afford to purchase several of these I would probably hate myself tomorrow."
"The robust flavor of hops is present from start to finish. This was an enjoyable beer that I would purchase again. Its not too often a high concentrate of alcohol (20%) tastes this smooth. A super, nice beer to start the evening with ."
"Extremely hazy with a light fluffy head that receded quickly into the glass. There is just a light residue settling to the bottom as I examine the beer. I'm still shocked that there is any head on the beer at all with the amount of alcohol present. The nose is a citrus bomb. Loads of grapefruit, pine, and herbal hop pour from the beer. Mild mandarin orange sweetness on the finish. Sharp grapefruit and mandarin orange sweetness up front, mild caramel notes are dominated by the hop. The finish has mild alcohol heat. It's there, but I can't believe there isn't more. The mouth feel is mildly sticky, still full. Decent drinkability. This is a big, hoppy beer. Not the best drinkability. It's more of an event."
"Drinkability: For it ABV this beer is remarkably drinkable. The hop flavors are massive and intense , but they do not overwhelm. Any hophead must pay this awsome brew homage. Big thanks to Dogfish Head for crafting such a unique and exellent beer."
"Finally found this, at whole foods of all places, I must give props to kim for getting hold of some. 12 oz was about 9 dollars total with tax, not bad, I heard it was 12 in Colorado. Poured aggressively in a tulip glass, the head was immense, thick and bubbly. Lovely white sticky lacing is every where. The color is a dense musty orange, amber, with darker tones centering about the lower middle. The sent is great, to the best of imperial IPA, lots of hop character balanced well with sweet malt notes. Fruit and sugar all over the place. There is a small hint of Alcohol; it is possible that this sent only occurs to me because apparently this beers ABV is 21. I definitely do not smell 21 Abv in this, which makes this a deliciously dangerous beer. Honestly I think theyve done an excellent job concealing it. I must say that of all the strong beers Ive had this one is the beer you should be most careful of. At about 9 dollars a 12 oz I doubt Id buy it all the time, but since its around so little Ill buy every one I can just to show off to friends. Also Im cellaring this beers brother for one year from now. This beer is not too different from any great double IPA at 9 abv, but this is a 21 and delicious, so be careful."
"All in all, this 192 dollar a case drink is All That. God help me, I'm going looking for the Raison D'Extra and World Wide Stout from Dogfish Head - they deliver quality goods."
"If you love hops and IPAs then I highly recommend trying this beer. I know I will be trying it again pretty soon."
"Huge props to JesseDaniels for sharing this and not liking, thus my drinking the majority of it and getting a good alcohol rip."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer, but one for special moments. The cost ($8.00 for 12 oz) may scare folks, but I have seen people pay more money for less of an experience. Again, this is a hop explosion, so if you are hop inclined, this is your type of beer"
"The 120 smashes the balance. The 60 comes in a 6 pack, the 90 in a 4 pack, this comes solo - all for about the same price. This beer polarizes the beer faithful: some think it went too far, others love it. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's an experiment - I've heard it described as a """pixie stick hop bomb""" - but I think it does what it does well. It's a thick, viscous syrup - think afterdinner drink (and at roughly 20% ABV, it's proofed like one). The aroma is afterdinner drinkish too - sweet almost plum brandy. It's sweet, it's hops-in-your-face, it's overboard - all that it's supposed to be, but also quite tasty. The version I had was from 2004, so the hops have likely mellowed out a bit. I'd love to try it fresh."
"From a 12oz bottle. Almost a murky orange color, with a 2cm frothy white head. The aroma was delightful, like a boquet of flowers with a sweet pale malt backbone, and a slight resinous tinge. I was slammed by the first sip, belly warming alcohol lets you know this is not a beer to mess around with. But then the flavors start coming through in waves, up front were strong malty flavors, raisins, plum, dates, and molassas. Then the balancing hop profile started comming through, strong floral and citrus flavors, orange, apricot, tangerine, peach, and more. In my notes I wrote """its boozy like bourbon or cogniac. It was like an IPA liquour. Silky mouthfeel. Definitely a special occasion sipper, but delicious."
"This IPA is the holy grail for the hopheads out there...highly recommend this one. It is definitely worth the premium price! Another excellent product from Dogfish Head! (....must finish this review...getting dizzy...drank too fast..but soo good...)"
"Mouthfeel- An almost over bearing malt sweetness mixed with an alcoholic burn never felt before in any burn. These new sensations in this highly heralded IPA are very intriguing because they break the mold for any normal IPA. The bitterness is there, but only a little due to the crazy amounts of malkt. Drank like it was fine cognac."
"Overall: I've had this beer laying around in storage for a good 4 or 5 months just waiting for a special occassion to try it. I'm glad I waited for my half century mark to sample this beast. Now I can say I've had the 60, 90, and 120 minute IPAs from DFH. Nice work Sam!"
"O: Even though this beer isn’t filling and is very flavorful, I can’t see how this beer can’t see how it can be anything else but a sipper with such a huge ABV. However, I probably drank it a little quicker than I should have. Luckily I was plowing pretzels along with it to help with alcohol absorption."
"This was a very good beer because of its uniqueness but lacked the hops I was hoping for in a true IPA The complexity was decieving, the first drink really is the best.. Also I couldnt see myself drinking more than one of these."
"You definitely need to sip this one. It will take you at least an hour and a half to finish it and that is if you really really rush."
"If you're expecting a gruff, American hop monster filled with pine and citrus hop flavors...you'll be in for a surprise. The 120 really cannot be defined stylistically; crossing boundaries between an Imperial IPA, American Barleywine, and Cognac. Heaven, (and a hangover), in every bottle."
"Markings are smeared, but I can see bottled 06. Had to go to OR to get this one. Pours a golden amber, with a small head and swirls from the collision of alcohol and water, almost like looking at a tequila anejo swirling in water. Tastefully extreme bitterness, coupled with sugary syrup and noticeable but delicate alcohol. Like novocain for the tongue and hot butterscotch for the throat, and a sweet beer reduction left on the lips. Numbing hops and numbing alcohol. A note of saccharin. Side note: it would make a great beer sorbet or salad dressing, or a sweet marinade or beer demi glaze for that matter. A near-liquor concoction with chewy malts and bitter oily hops galore. A real palate-killer, so save this one for last. If you like whiskey, rum, or tequila, you'll love this one. Cheers, DFH, this was much better and well put together than it was when it first came out (the last time I had it). Score!"
"D: Ahhh, drinkable? Drinkable how? quantity?--no way. It's worth getting a hold of even at the steep price tag (~$9). 21% abv--Holy Crap! Definately a sipping beer---and only one at a time! But also a very tasty offering from DFH, not that I'm suprised."
"This beer is worth trying, but for the price, not more than once or twice. It is more the style of a Samiclaus than a I2PA, but not as complex or balanced as that beer. I know it's hyped, and I do like Dogfish Head beers a lot, but this beer is not for me. I am tempted to get a bottle to age for several years, but only a little tempted."
"Drinkability is a hard one. Its good enough to keep drinking, but you wouldn't want to drink too many. A 12 oz of this is like 6oz of vodka. A little goes a long ways."
""""What you have here is the holy grail for hopheads. This beer is continually hopped over a 120-minute boil and then dry-hopped every day for a month. Enjoy now or age for a decade or so.""""
"Although I have had 120 minute several times before and I have a handful in my cellar, I am reviewing this from my last sampling of it, at the DFH brewery at about 10am during the bocce tournament. The beer poured a deep caramel, almost deep brown color with a slight offwhite head. The nose was caramelly and also a bit fruity and sweet, all the while with the high abv lurking in the nose. The taste is extreme as can be expected and pretty sweet. I felt that at times I could feel sugar swishing around in my mouth but not overpoweringly sweet like a syrupy beer. There is a nice hop bitterness amongst the sweetness and the high abv (about 18% on this version I think) really comes through and kicks you at the end...also in the middle."
"I agree with those who sense a """caramel-like""" or butterscoth taste. Was very rich, and while the alcohol could be sensed, it didn't dominate the taste. I will definitely be trying this one again, perhaps at different ages. I'd like to get a hold of a few that have spent multiple years in safe storage. I'd definitely recommend it to those willing to spend $9 on a 12oz bottle."
"A generic hop flavor and and aroma were present, but indistinct and battling the intense sweet butterscotch/caramel malt. Bitterness was barely perceptible against an intensely thick, almost cloying sweetness.To its credit, it was not undrinkable, but half a glass was as much as was possible to get down comfortably. This was the 2006, I can't imagine how much less hoppy this could get when aged."
"Gotta say I really enjoyed this brew, it was worth the wait and the cost."
"I couldn't drink more than one of these at a sitting but still, it is a pretty great beer. Dogfish Head kicks ass!"
"Even at 21% (was the '03 that high?) this is extrodinarily and exceptionally easy to drink and boasts probably some of the best flavor arrangements I've ever come across. As far as highly suped-up IPAs go, this is on the top rung. Almost no contest."
"d-whew, not all that easy to drink, tastes good, smells good, a fine beer, but it does not go down easy at all, took quite a while to finish, only had a 12 oz. bottle, cant imagine trying to finish one of the bombers like in the picture"
"Okay, its good, tasty and I would buy it again...maybe even age it a few years. But it is not so drinkable...you can really feel the alcohol in this one. And at 20% (my bottle is 20%, not 21%), to think you wouldn't notice the alcohol is just silly."
"Another great beer from DFH, not a beer that I would drink every day or every week for that mater. A very interesting beer that is alot more complex than some people give it credit for. I say it's worth the price to try and you should pick one up if you can."
"Overall: For the """Holy Grail for Hopheads""" I was a little disappointed. A little too sweet for my tastes. I understand and respect DFH for what they were going for here and I did enjoy this beer and I will have it again, in about a year when the other one I bought has aged a bit."
" I appreciate this beer more every time I have it. I get grapefruit, liquid hops. The malt isn't overpowering, especially considering the high ABV. Mouthfeel is thick, drinkability good for me."
"D-I'm glad I tried it but I won't be getting it again any time soon. I was expecting more citrus hop taste and a lot more bitterness to it."
" If we want to give points for extremism. that's one thing, but if tasting good and being pleasurable to drink are criteria this one fails."
"What's amazing to me is how understated the hops present, knowing the prodigious amounts used. And yet, with the scale weighted to the grain and sugary fermentables, it still does come through as quite bitter and hoppy, though in the background, not upfront. The ABV is glaring in the nose, but decidedly more down-tempo in the taste, or as understated as 21% can possibly be. This is one for the occasional occasion, but when the occasion hits, it's worth each viscous drop."
"2003 vintage, opened August 2006. Pours out a reddish brown, with a thin off white head, and plenty of carbonation. The nose is fruity, with peaches, and strawberries, bellied by hops and yeast. Taste sweetly carbonated, but finishes fairly dry and clean."
"Drinkability is very good for its style- and after dinner sipper that is quite addictive."
"Flavor is not as whacked out as I expected. There is a bit of heat from the alcohol but the burn is not nearly what I would have imagined. Kind of a fruit/cherry juice thing going on and a wood aged tannin flavor too. Malts are surprisingly strong and hold up quite well. Best part is that the hops are not nearly as astringent as I imagined. Medium mouthfeel that improves as the beer warms but in the sense that the beer evaporates off the tongue and becomes more light bodied. Nice beer but not sure I have much interest in trying a second bottle."
"An expensive bottle, but absolutely worth every penny. A must try."
"Overall: Definitely tasty, but the hop bitterness is overpowered by the malty sweetness. I was hoping that the balance would tip towards hops rather than malts."
"Overall: An interesting experiment, to be sure, but not something that's likely to take up residence in my cellar and, at nearly $9 a bottle, that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, hazy orange hue. Extra points for head retention on such a high ABV beer. Very sweet fruity aroma. Taste is amazingly sweet with a bit of alcohol on the finish and a small amount of hops trying to come through. The finish actually reminds me of cotton candy it is so sweet. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. This is not a beer that has a high drinkability, this is something that you split a 12oz bottle of with a friend. Definately worth a try if you can find it."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a coppery orange-hued amber with the thinnest fizzy head that quickly vanished only to leave a spotted film with light whitish sticky lacing. Smell is sweet, caramelly malt up front, hops very faint but present, slightly grainy and grassy, followed by some light alcohol notes that finish out the nose. Taste is super sweet, huge alcohol presence, no suprise there, leaves a crisp and dry aftertaste with a hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is slippery and smooth, fuller bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability is impressive given the extreme +20% abv, sips smooth and wonderfully complex balancing act between some super heavy sweet maltiness and heavy hops. However, would recommend enjoying only one in a sitting, as the alcohol is smooth enough to catch one off their guard. Would purchase again."
"I personally find this a bit hard to drink; it's more of a sipper, like a fine brandy."
"This most massive of IPA's pours an amber gold with a surprisingly thick white head which clings to the glass. The nose is full of complex fruity esters and sweetness and spicy citrusy hops. Some alcohol notes are also present. Taste is very very sweet at first. A little hop bitterness hits for a moment. Then the alcohol hits, strongly, but it doesn't seem like 21%. There is a lot of risidual sweetness in the finish. All in all, the sweetness is the most dominating characteristic. The taste really is much more similar to a barley wine than any other double IPA I've had. In fact I've many barleywines with a more noticable hop character than this. The mouthfeel is very smooth and rather heavy. This isn't very drinkable. But it's not meant to be. Overall this is pretty good stuff and amazingly smooth for the alcohol. Not what I was expecting but great stuff anyway."
"days. Excellent beer!"
"I must say, this is a disturbingly well-balanced beer for how hugely powerful it is. I could, if I didn't know better, finish this off pretty quick, only to find myself planted to the floor, most likely. I really like this...though it is NOT something I would drink more than one of (which is why I ding the drinkability) or buy that often (dollar/oz ratio is a bit rough and I'm not out to get drunk) but yeah, I'm very glad that I tried it."
"This is an extreme brew, Ultra-sweet, Super hoppy and heady. Mega ABV % that limits this to a maximum of two. If you can handle two!"
"Drinkability: found myself wishing I'd gotten more beer and less head from the pour, but it was complimentary so no complaints! That said, the huge alcohol content limits drinkability."
"I would definitely be interested to see what this is like after being salaried for a couple of years or even, as the bottle suggests, decades."
"DFH certainly is pushing the envelope with this one, but it's just not something i see people drinking that much, especially since i could have two of these and call it a night"
"Pours with a hazy golden color, with a cascade effect like I have never seen before. Much like a cream ale with the white top floating lightly on the beer down below, and it creeps op on the top. Interesting lacing left on the glass after all settles too, rigid on the side of the glass. Smell is almost non existent, but after swirling it a bit there is a touch of alcohol. Not the huge hop nose I was expecting. Taste is extraordinary. Very thick, and when it gets on your lips it wipes away like molasses. Amazing, not a hint of alcohol. You can taste the malt that was added to make the higher ABV. Almost scarily smooth, one could keep drinking this and be in trouble real quick!"
"Overall it's a wonderful new flavor that makes me want more."
"Mouthfeel is quite big and slick...this is a sipper no doubt about it. An interesting brew but I think I'd rather stick to the 90 Minute myself as the sweetness gets to be a bit too much for me. I gotta them props for hiding the alcohol here though as it's not overly noticeable. Definetly a brew that everyone should try at least once as it shows how far things can be pushed! I have a few other bottles aging and it will be interesting to see how time affects this one. Thanks to FoolCircle for this particular bottle."
"Well, I had heard about this beer, it was almost a fable..."""21% alcohol and it is still a beer?!"""...but had never actually """seen""" it anywhere. Many places carry the 60 minute or 90 minute ales but it took a trip to Portland, ME to actually find a single bottle of 120. And trust me, I have been to a lot of incredibly savvy, beer filled distributors in the past. So was it everything that people had talked about and more?..eh, not exactly. Maybe I had hyped it up too much in my mind as being one of these holy grail type beers, high ABV and extreme drinkability, but it took almost 2 hours to sip through the heavy, almost syrupy liquid. No doubt on the ABV, this stuff packs a punch, but I could only find one person at a party of 35 who enjoyed it.(side note: it was a little tiny girl who said it was better than the summer ales she was drinking, go figure!) The reason was probably the strange sweetness that accompanied the brew. It was a very strong flavor that I'm sure is added to make consuming a high-test alcohol and hop beer more drinkable...but as I am a fan of the pure hop taste it kind of ruined the fun for me. Would I drink it again? Probably not, as one BA said before it could have been better for a late night in the dead of winter instead of at a 4th of July BBQ like I tried. It was 6.99 for the single bottle, a bit pricey but in the limited quantity not outrageous. Still, in the spirit of try everything once I would recommend it to all BA's and hops lovers alike."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: So was it worth it? Maybe. As the latest must-have beer, I guess it was. Is there better out there for less? Surely. In all, Id say that 120 Minute IPA is a damn good dessert beer to be enjoyed in moderation."
"Overall, another fine brew from Dogfish Head. The only drawback is the lack of hop character for this American Double IPA and it's high price for a single bottle. However, I will be purchasing the occasional bottle for those times when I want sit back and take it easy."
"A light brown ale, with a thick white head. A very hoppy aroma with this beer. The sweetness of the high alcohol content overwhelms the hoppiness of this beer. Overall this beer is not anywhere near as bitter as you’d expect, but holds its place in Dogfish’s lineup"
"Pours a hazy deep copper with a small head that quickly diminishes. Nose is crisp floral hops, citrus and alcohol. Full bodied taste that starts out with a strong alcoholic punch that mellows out and finishes with a strong hop bitterness and sweetness.This beer is definately one to sip on for a while from its high abv. Just too sweet for my liking. This is definately one of those beers you at least want to try once."
"Clear red gold color with a good head that faded fairly quickly. The aroma was malty sweet, with some grass type of aroma coming through. The taste was very firm malt, sweet with fruit and spice flavors at first. Hops came through towards the end, but didn't dominate or stick around much in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was slick, with minimal perceived carbonation. An interesting offering, but not my idea of a double IPA. Definately a sipper."
" Given the absurdly high alcohol content and the thick texture, I'd say this is fairly drinkable. Not a purchase I'm likely to repeat, but a very interesting offering from a remarkable brewery."
"my fatrhers day beer.04 bottle. poured an amber copper, with a small off white head that didnt last but left some lacing.aroma caramel , alcohol, tangerine, honey, brown sugar,than got some hops, was excepting more hops, a whole bunch of sweetness. flavor wow the alcohol comes right out there than all that sweetness with some hops. this is almost to the point of being too sweet. going to see if I can find a fresher bottle."
"Drinkability- I love it, but then I love extreme beers. I could easily drink 2 but will cellar the other 2 I have for at least 6 months. This is very much like Avery Mephistopheles, not quite as sweet, a little more bitter. Try it once, everyone deserves a blast in the mouth like this."
"Way too extreme but worth having once. Very high IBU with tons of malting on the other side. I had no clue it was 21% no wonder I knocked myself out. Must be had with evening meal, but still some stomach burning. I would like to cellar, my criticism being I could not find a date on this small bottle."
"This brew is actually drinkable, in small quantities. I'm not sure I could do even a 12 ounce bottle by myself. The alcohol cacn become overwhelming if drank too quickly, the sweetness goes past cloying if you try to guzzle, but sit back, take it in a sip at a time, and this works wonders. Interesting, in a unique sort of way."
"To say the least, this is not a subtle beer. I wouldn't go haphazardly passing this out to friends. One has to make sure they are prepared for a beer like this. The hops do beckon me to want more. At this point I usually check the ABV....wow, this will kick my ass. Now I'm curious to see how it ages. Check my re-review in 2016."
"This is a sipping brew. Tasty, but strong. More like a triple or quadruple IPA."
"The sweetest beer I've ever had, and my first 120 IPA. I hope to get a fresh bottle to compare at some point."
"Drinkability, if you treat it right it's very drinkable. Split a glass with two other people. Savor it."
"poured into a wide mouth goblet glass. This beer has a nice amber-orange color with thin white head and loose lacing. Smells like honey sweetened citrus, mainly grapefruit, with a light pine and clove background. This beer taste great!! Sweet honey/sugary flavor in the forefront, slight citrus/pine dryness in the backtaste. This beer has a thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, especially for being 21%. The alcohol is presented well for such a strong brew. I really liked this beer; however, I have not had any other IPA that presented itself like this. To me this was more like an excellent meade or perhaps a barleywine. I actually didn't know it was an IPA because my husband poured it and said """drink this.""" I would gladly drink it again!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very sweet and sticky. Man this beer is over the top. The beer is full bodied. The beer avoids being sickly sweet due to spicy alcohol and maybe a bit of hops. Honestly the hops really didnt play a big part in the beer. The beer is pretty drinkable inspite of its massive alcohol content. It might even be a bit irresponsible to not have alcohol content present on the label. Gods of beer this beer kicks like a donkey. This beer is wierdly very easy to drink. This beer was almost like drinking an over proof JW Lees Harvest Ale. This beer is fantastic and I can harldly wait to see what a year or five will do to this beer."
"Mouthfeel is thick & full bodied. Low but good carbonation. Alcohol warming is pretty much instantaneous. Certainly not something you're going to drink more than one of in a sitting....or even a day maybe. Worth trying again, though."
"$8 per 12 oz. bottle"
"This brew has a medium body with minimal carbonation. Citrus and pine laden hop tone with a crazy sweet malt backing. Alcohol is well hidden on the palate but once it hits the old gut zang! Fruit notes are all over the place: grapefruit, pineapple along with an almost zany candy sugar sweetness. This is once beast of a brew, as such I don't think I can actually offer an objective score on the drinkability department as I don't have a benchmark on 20% brews. Four sips into this and I am already feeling it. This is colossal, but almost too sweet. Well worth a try, if you don't plan on drinking anything else for another two hours. I would love to get my hands on one that has been aged about 4 years."
"D: This is a beer to be taken in limited quantities. It's not a beer I could drink more then one in a sitting. Seeing that I also bought Rouges 2IPA That one is going to have to wait seeing I have to leave soon and It might not be wise to drink it after this monster. So in the end if you want a beer that you will only drink one beer and be good for a bit this is it."
"Look, this is good, but this is more of a barley wine... which I love and still score nicely."
"Excellent Job Sam"
"I can't wait for the next opportunity to bask in 120's glory..."
"Overall Impression: Huge beer with extremely complex flavors. A sweetness that lasts for a while and finishes with a light delicate bitterness. I liked it more when at room temperature. A great beer right after a steak dinner, I think. Dogfish Head's 120 IPA is an Imperial India Pale Ale boiled for 2 hours while being continuously hopped with high alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for a month and aged for another month."
"This is not a particularly drinkable beer. Its extreme flavor, heavy mouth feel and high alcohol content make it more of an experience than a drink. Its price is as extreme as its flavor. I dont think Ill have 120 Minute IPA again, but I am glad I had it once."
"Poured an absolute gorgeous color of orange with a wonderful creamy looking half inch of head. Carbonation races to the top of the glass furiously. I really like the way this looks. Nice lacing too. The nose consists of syrupy malt and syrupy hops. Taste feels as if it's yet to be fleshed out. I bet some time under the belt would do wonders here. I get a hint of pine, sweet malt, and actually pretty well disguised alcohol considering the ABV. Not very complex yet, but I would surmise that's what the cellar is for with this beer. What I would give to try a 5 year old version of this. Mouth is rich and creamy. Drinkability suffers due to the immature taste. If it were ripe though, I can only guess that it would be off the chart. Thank you Dogfish Head for being adventurous in your brewing. Please continue to tread new grounds."
"Beware of this one, alcohol is VERY well masked. Not a bad showing from DFH at all."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer for how strong it is. For the most part, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. It's obviously there but it doesn't hit you like you think 22% would."
"Nice creamy head, extraordinary lace all the way down. Incredible blast of flavors right off the bat. Malty sweetness balanced by big hop bitterness. great beer WAY expensive. would love to have some several years after cellaring, i think the flavors would blend and improve even more."
"Not a super drinkable brew here. Super sweet and thick with a high alcohol content this is decidedly inferior to the best from Three Floyds or Russian River."
"Sampled from a fresh bottle dated 3/3/06. Color is a bright copper with lots of big, slow moving bubbles for carbonation. Head is tall, thick, and off-white. Retention is high for a beer with this much ABV. Not much here in for smell. Traces of citrissy hops, alcohol, and a fruity malt are noted. Taste is of a very sweet, make that an almost sickly sweet malt, with a slight edge of fruitiness. Strong alcohol flavor is in the mix. Some citrissy hop flavor fades into the background. I was actually expecting this to be a very, very hoppy beer. This reminds me more of a supped up euro strong lager, like something from Russia. There's just too much sweetness and alcohol here for my tastes. I'm gonna set my other bottle aside for a long, long time and see what happens."
"Overall, this is a very complicated and very strong beverage. Unlike anything I've ever had (a title that formerly belonged to Dogfish's Fort). If you haven't, try it. You won't regret spending the $9 for a bottle. Will I buy another bottle? Maybe. Not anytime soon; this is not one that I'll add to my standard lineup, but a worthwhile adventure."
"while my score for this isnt very high I enjoyed this brew and was impressed at how well it held up. the label says you can age it for a decade or so but i suspect you'd have really expensive paint thinner by then and not much else. get this sucker fresh, despite the alcohol content, dont make the mistake of cellaring this thing."
"Man...that's a serious kick in the teeth! Even puts the most seasoned beer drinker back on their heels. The beer just plops into the glass, then laces and legs and carbonates around boastfully. Releases aromas of bigtime hops and malts with every descriptor word that has ever been used on this website. Flavors to the same, and more. Use every 'hop' adjective you know, use every 'malt' adjective you know. That's what this beer is. Use every 'mouthfeel' word you can think of. That's it too. The beer is more that an IPA; it's an IPAwine. Must be sipped like a cognac. The hops never subside under the imense malts and alcohol. Could easily be put in the 'Strong Ale, or Old Ale' catagories. Easily competes with Utopias for most powerful beer. A 100% joy and honor to drink."
"I just picked up 3 cases of this in Richmond, VA and could not wait to get home to try it. When poured, it fills up the pint glass to the top with about an inch of head. It has a dark orange color to it. The scent is great, but may be over the top for some. If you don't like IPAs, don't waste your time or money, and at $9 a bottle it would be money well saved. You can smell the hops right away and there is some smell of alcohol. When tasted there is a flavor of great hops and some malt. I think it is a good balance since I like that type of beer. There is also a good bitterness to it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
"I will give this a """4"" on drinkability because it's amazing they have balanced this out so well at over 20% alcohol. It's an easy drinking beer, all things considered. More than one of these would be out of the question generally, but this one is mighty tasty and enjoyable. Fantastic balance for such a high abv extreme beer."
"D- I was expecting the hoppiest beer of my life but that was far from the case. I got loads of alcohol heat and some nice caramel malt note in the back but not the hops. This beer was fresh and I was hoping to get the most of the hops but no such luck. The bottle says the beer ages well but there is no """brewed on date""" for reference. I love Dogfish Head but this beer is a bit of a letdown. I think with age the alcohol would die down but then do the hops die down even more?"
"Take your time, sip away, respect and enjoy slowly. That is the nature of this beer, and while one person might say its hopped to high hell and abv is out of control, I say its a beautifully crafted. At $8, and basically needing to spend a half hour focusing solely on enjoying it, I can't imagine having more than one a year, or one every half year. But, I'll be headed back to the store to pick up a few to stash the cellar."
"This is a young bottle, and I grabbed several, we'll see how it lives up in the basement. Good overall, but so far can't go wrong with 60/90 minute versions."
"Drinkability- Umm, session beer...no. Maybe a once a month beer is you can stand to pay the $10 a pop. Not the hop bomb people expect, but a very nice sipping liquor-like beer."
"Drinkability- Too sweet and wouln't try antoher i don't think but recommend trying at least once. Did a good job hiding the 21.00% alcohol."
"Poured aggresively into chalice and produced fantastic 1-2""" head!! Copper in color with fluffy off-white head and slight carbonation. Aroma from the hops was not as prominent as I thought it would be. Oaky alcohol on the nose woth fruit. I was expecting an absolute hop bomb but it wasn't. Great citrus tones with a little grassiness to it. The maltiness balanced this beer so well. Very thick mouthfeel. Definately looking forward to the other bottle."
"The mouthfeel is very oily and the drinkability is very low on this one. Definitely a sipper."
"Drinkability is a little less than I'd like to see. I thought WWS and Raison D'Extra were both VERY drinkable at 18% and 20% respectively so I was expecting more out of this one. All in all, I'm still pleased I have some to lay down for future tastings."
"Served on tap in an 8 oz glass, this is a nice amber color with a thin white head, some decent lacing. Nose is a very strong citrusy hops, some floral notes, a sweet alcoholic undertone. Taste is a mix of burning alcohol and strong resinous citric and grapefruit hops. It's a little much, not nearly as enjoyable to drink as the 90. Full bodied with a slick oily mouthfeel, this one is definitely a sipper. This isn't nearly as drinkable as the WWS--I'm glad I tried this but don't think I will again."
"Finally got to try the big one. At $8.00 for a 12 ounce bottle and 21%ABV, not for the faint of heart. A pretty red/orange color with a medium head that quickly dissipated. All I could smell was sweet fruit and alcohol. The taste followed the odor: sweet,sweet fruit, alcohol, with a hops coming in later. A very thick, rich mouthfeel. I started with it chilled, let it sit, and finished it at room temperature. Definitely better at room temperature. I'd look at this as a dessert beer, and would figure that 6-12 ounces would be my limit."
"Overall, I'd drink it again. Just once though...21% is quite a haul if I want any other beers on that given day!"
"well done DFH"
"Sampled this beer many times , had some yesterday so figured i'd give my review. Served from a twelve ounce bottle into a snifter at cellar temperature .Poured a golden orange with very little head, but didn't pour too vigorously. The aroma was of hops , citrus fruits, and tons of alcohol. First taste was totally alcohol. The next was a little easier with a taste of hops, followed by more alcohol that left a little burn at the back of my throat. There is no hiding this alcohol. Had a nice full almost thick mouth feel. Not real drinkable but not bad to sit down and sip with dinner. Is definatley an EXTREME beer."
"OK, I know that this beer is meant to be strong, and it most certainly is, but when a beer has little taste other than that of alcohol, it ceases to be enjoyable. Dogfish has done a great job with the 60 minute IPA and even the 90 Minute IPA but the 120 Minute IPA is better left to those who are looking to get drunk and don't care about taste."
"D - The main thing I kept thinking as I was writing this review is that the alcohol is unnecessarily strong. I feel that it knocks everything else out of balance. Good thing I was sharing the bottle with my sister, because I would not have been able to finish the bottle myself."
"I used to not like hops. Still don't, when the beer itself doesn't match its hop presence. But here, as in other really fantastically hoppy beers like Rogue I2PA and Arrogant Bastard, the hop presence is nicely balanced within a really great fruit profile, and the overall experience is amazingly textured and good. I guess I'm just a reluctant hophead, but I guess anyone who loves this beer as much as I can't be considered anything but a fan of the hop-bombs. I'll buy this instantly the next time I see it."
"The beer poured a golden color with very little head and little carbonation ( as expected in such a high abv brew). Left nice lacing as the head settle very quickly into a thin white covering. I was disappointed with the smell of this beer. I was expecting a great hop smell, but the sweet smell over powered the hop smell. It smelled of candied sugar with a hint of hops and alcohol following. The beer (like the 90 Minute) first hit me with a overly sweet taste, and followed with a decent hop presence. Alcohol warming definitely is a flavor in the profile, but not as dramatic as I expected in such a high abv beer. I don't think this beer tasted like a DIPA, but more like a really sweet barleywine. The mouthfeel was medium to thick and really coated the tongue. The drinkability was good for such a high abv beer, but sweetness really detracted from the overall experience. This beer is not really my cup of tea, but it is interesting enought to atleast try if you get the chance."
"Sunset orange with golden pink edges. Small, ephemeral, off-white head. Didnt expect much head though. Rum-soaked fruit up the wazoo. Sharp, tangy malt sweetness. Hops and alcohol mix together in a slightly burning manner. Interesting, boozy (but not overly). Soft, sweet doppelbock-ish malt sweetness. Sugary, candy malts come through. Fruity (estery) alcohol floods the palate. Tropicalia pineapple, mango, pears. Brandy. Singed hop flavor and futile bitterness come in later. Warming, sweet and sticky finish (long). Thick, soft, syrupy, but not cloying. Dangerous."
"12 oz. bottle dated 2003. The last beer of our february MCD meeting. we saved it until the end because we didn't want to be totally smashed while we were tasting everything else. Poured reddish brown with a small white head. looks fine. Mild hop smell. smells sweet, too, like cane sugar. Taste is sweet, alcohol tasting. syrupy sweet hop flavor. thick consistency, like a hoppy brandy. Oh man, i dont know if i could drink even a whole bottle by myself. too much alcohol. it hit me fast, too. but other than that, pretty good. 60 and 90 are better."
"Opinion: Well, what can I say about such an anomaly of beer? There should be a special category for these project beers so that you won't put them there with some of the more palatable products on the market. You can't knock Sam for producing this beer, and it takes talent to squeeze the yeast this hard...but this ain't no session beer! I was happier with it this sample than I was last timethis may have to do with the fact that I aged it for a year, but I think that I am just more appreciative of the stronger beers here lately as I too have made a few in the 1.200 OG range this last year."
"I have to ask, where did the alcohol go?. DFH once again does an amazing job of burring an amazing amount of booze. Delicious!"
"12 oz. bottle with no vintage year, but it's the latest bottling as far as I know. It pours a very clear orangey/amber with a thin 1/8""" off-white head that leaves some bits of lacing. Upon closer inspection it appears unfiltered and even has a few beads of carbonation. Overall, it looks much better than I expected for something of this strength, but it's nothing to rave about. It smells of gentle fruits/hops (citrus, apricot), alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The taste is very sweet as well, with a dose of caramel, perhaps some smoke, and a good amount of fruits (orange, apricot). It is pretty bitter, yes, but... 120 IBUs? It's all hidden by the intense sweetness of the malts, which is also evident in the almost syrupy mouthfeel - it's one of the thickest beers I've come across. Also one of the most warming. Each sip feels like I just drank a liqueur, but I suppose it is as strong as some cordials. Not sure if I'd classify as a double IPA, as the malts seem to take the forefront here, and at times, the 120 reminds me of a barley wine. Apparently many reviewers here feel the same way. Too over the top I'd say, though not a bad beer. I'd like to see them tone the malts down some and let the IBUs come through. Not sure if I'd buy it again, but I'd drink it again if it were offered."
"I dont think this beer would make a good session beer at all. It is way to high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is quite aggressive. I am still curious by the flavor. This beer is way more like a Barley Wine than anything else. I think this one is just a little over the top."
"Deep copper color that's clear. No head really, only medium carbonation appears. The smell is fairly hoppy, with citrus aroma, only partially alcoholic considering the ABV on this one. The taste is very dry. The citrus flavor is stronger and tastes like tangerines. More hop flavor also. The alcohol taste is quite strong, but not enough to ruin it. It does burn the back of the throat slightly. You can certainly feel the alcohol peeking into the bloodstream. The mothfeel is slightly thin, perhaps because there's so much alcohol, carbonation is medium. This one is definitely a sipper. Not highly drinkkable, but a unique brew to enjoy on a special occasion with friends perhaps. I'm glad I got to try it..."
"Clear copper in color, poured with about a half finger of off-white head. Slowly rising carbonation. Noticing the fruity sweetness first in the aroma. The clean grassy hop aroma with some pine undertones is strong, but not overpowering. Wow, what a huge beer. I'm not even sure how to describe this. Almost a hoppy port? The sweetness stands out, mostly fruity. Raisins, plums, grapes... This is a big, sticky, chewy beer. Good God, there is no way this is 21% ABV. A beer that big just should not be this drinkable."
"At the outset of this endeavor, I went into it with an idea of what this beer was. I thought that it was a novelty of sorts. I was wrong. It isnt overpowering and has plenty going on. I thought that I was going to be getting myself into a bottle of pancake syrup with lots of burning alcohol. Again, I was wide of the mark. I am impressed. I paid about $9 per bottle, but it was worth it. It was tasty, enjoyable and entertaining. I am anxious to cellar the other bottles. I rate the drinkability at 4.0 due to the fact that it is about 21% abv and about $9 a bottle. That means that I can only drink a couple of them before I am piss ass drunk AND broke."
"Drinkability is good. This certainly didn't come across as being a 21% abv in the chalice but I was feeling it by the end of the chalice."
"This is one creation by DFH that is even a bit extreme as far as """extreme""" beers go. A nice one to try, but the high-price tag (around $8 for me) make this a beer that is saved (or cellared) for special occasions or to try once or twice. I couldn't imagine drinking this on a regular basis. An interesting and unique beer, that turned out to be much more malty than I could have possibly expected."
"Overall, this is an interesting creation from DFH. I enjoy the ale and recommend it. The low scores result from my attempt to review within the DIPA style."
"Split a 12 oz. bottle with dirtylou on the last night of my stay. We've been pining to try this beer since the beginning of our beer enlightenment period...this has truly been a """momentous moment""". This one kind of threw me for a loop. There was a pretty big hop aroma and flavor, but the bitter/sharp/acidic characteristic both in the nose and on the tongue was low. Very low for a DIPA. I assume that primarily low AA hops were used, but who knows."
"drinkability: not quite what i expected but tough for the style"
"I have had this many times, and like it regardless of what I said above, but I usually pour this in a """vertical""" tasting for friends with the 60 and 90 minute IPAs along side. Everyone gravitates to the 90 and expresses genuine fear of this."
"120 Minute IPA is a nastily-sweet brew more closely related to Midas Touch--or even Liquor de Malt--than either the 60 or 90 Minute IPAs. It claims to be a hophead's dream, but would be more appropriately marketed to the asshole wine people that purposefully leave the price tag on their expensive bottle of Merlot. Yeah, there's some hops, but there's also a huge alcohol burn if you hold it in your mouth for more than a millisecond and a meady honey sweetness that is truly disgusting. The only redeeming flavor is the barest hint of nuttiness, but that's like complimenting John Merrick on his lovely tan."
"Drinkability: For 21% abv, I am surprised at the drinkability of this beer, but I'm happy to be drinking half now and half later in the night."
"After about 6 or 7 oz. of this, I'm ready to move on. The alcohol mixed with the hops are just too much for me to want to drink more than 1 or 2 of this one."
"Drinkability - highly, highly enjoyable. I would love to be able to sit around and drink several of these, but it would probably kill me - both financially and from alcohol poisoning. A beer I will definitely seek out and hang onto for special ocassions, but a sipper."
"i finally cracked this one open last night and poured it into my duvel tulip. It had a nice golden color with a 1\2 in white head that left some lacing on the side of the glass. As soon as you cracked open the bottle you immediatley smell the hops with the alcohol. This becomes even more evident once you pour it into the glass. the first thing that came to my palate was hops,hops, and more hops and then take a guess what was next...the alcohol..once this beer warms it becomes a nice sipper that i might just sit back and relax with. Be careful who you let sample this because if they don't know what's coming it may just destroy them"
"I can understand why some may hate it, and why some love it, this Beer is dancing on the outer edges of brewing, and my palate was teetering on that cliff for a while but made it though safely."
"Drinkability - if you look at this as being able to drink more than one at a time it fails misserably. My belly is already warm and my head is spinning. But if you look at it as a question of whether you would try it again and recommend it, it gets a big yes. This is a must try beer if for no other reason than to appreciate how Dogfish managed to brew a 21% beer. This beer surprised me in many ways and my only complaint is that i would have enjoyed a little more of a hop character."
"I'm not sure what year this bottle is, I think it is 2005 but I don't know for sure. This beer pours a clear golden amber with a half inch off white head that dropped to a small collar quickly. The smell is citrusy, like grated orange peels with a toasty malt lingering in the background. The first sip gave a bit of an alcohol burn on the tongue, more of the orange peel then some toast. It finishes very clean, almost no after taste, I was expecting some bitterness here but didn't get any. The mouthfeel is medium with a great deal of carbonation. Even though the inital taste had some alcohol; in the rest of the glass it was hidden very well. I finished the whole bottle and wrote this review with only one spelling error, I am impressed with myself."
"Perfect copper pours thick with a small creamy tan head that leaves behind a splotchy pile of bubbles and film. Smells are light, but of potent bitter and abrasive hops kissed with alcohol. Kind of surprised on the flavor profile. Its strong and syrupy sweet to start with, and while bitter, is actually kind of balanced, which was not what I though I was getting into. The sweetness is like syrup and powdered sugar on French Toast made with lots of vanilla. The hops are not overpowering, not out of line. They are bitter and resinous, but blend well with the super-sweet malt profile and hints of alcohol, which are amazing light for a brew this strong. I was expecting, and kind of hoping, that this would be more of a super bitter hop brew, but the sweetness is so prevalent it fairly well balances the hops. Syrupy body and very light carbonation. Not bad, but not what I would call drinkable and not what I was hoping for. I shouldnt mark it down for not meeting my expectations I guess, but for a beer said to be The holy grail for hopheads it sure could use maybe another 60 minutes of hopping or something."
"I would love to have this more often, if it wasnt so damn expensive. But (the prices) arent ever going to lower on this beer, so suck it up & enjoy your $10+ twelve ounce bottles."
"Kudos to DFH for creating a 21% beer with almost no alcohol in the taste. I just dont see a huge market for this one aside from the curious."
"What impresses me so much is the drinkability of a beer that is so high in alcohol."
"This pours a dark rich amber color with a full two finger head.The smell is very hop filled with some spices,and alittle hint of citrus.For a beer with as much alcohol as this, this is a very smooth beer with a full hop flavor.but not as hoppy as I thought it would be.I wonder how it would taste if I tried an aged one.This is an excellent beer from Dogfish Head and I highly recommend it."
"It's an interesting beer that you really can't compare to anything else. I'm glad I tried it, but I prefer it's little brother the 90 minute IPA. It won't be a regular in my rotation."
"All in all, this beer is incredibly good, and should not be missed. $9 for a bottle, or $10.50 on tap does seem expensive(expecially on a college budget like mine), but DFH 120 is well worth every penny. It's not a beer, it's an experiance. And this is one beer that should be experianced by everyone at some point. Granted, I don't think it's an IPA, or anything even close. It is way too malty and sweet to be classified as such. But regardless of what you want to call it, I like to call it heaven in a goblet!"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for such a high abv; an incredible achievement though just a bit too sweet to consume in quantity (even if the abv were lower)"
"Really, I have no gripes with this beer. I love hops, I love strong IPAs, but this beer was just too much for me. Once I've decided to stop being a pansy, I'll try again. Who knows, maybe I'll love it!"
"I could drink this all day, but not for the price."
" In short, I wouldn't buy this beer again if it were four dollar a bottle, let alone fifteen. No doubt, technically this is a well built beer, but that doesn't mean it tastes good."
"However, just because its unique doesn't make it good or anymore drinkable."
"This is a very good beer. It was poured into a DFH snifter. There was a decent head, and it was a nice amber. It smelled exclusively of medicinal alcohol. In a way, I almost wish it were served out of an over sized shot glass or even a highball glass, to eliminate the offensive smell. The taste, however, was incredible. It was both extremely sweet and bitter from the hops which was a cool mix. In addition, there was a mild citrus flavor to compliment the hops. It was delicious going down...I could drink this all night. Its drinkability is on par with a strong barleywine, and is much better then any 42 proof liquor. This is one mean beer."
"Drinkability: Share this with a friend, as I did. It's surely a must, though I could've finished the bottle with at least an hour to do it. An amazing beer, and I'll be looking for a case ASAP to cellar and enjoy on special occasions, and of course winter also. Try it for sure if you can."
"Wow. The beer pours a cloudy amber with virtually no head. The bouquet was extremely intense hops and a slight hint of fruits.The taste was of hops first and foremost; what I expect from an IPA but ended very smooth and relatively sweet. There was a bit of carbonation to begin with, but it died down after a few minutes. As it warmed, subtle flavors of citrus(namely orange) and honey came out, giving a very pleasant creamy mouthfeel and overall excellent beer experience. This was extrememly well balanced for 21% alcohol; you hardly notice it. If you like IPA and care to try a VERY strong, VERY good flavorful variety, check this one out."
"Overall- a huge disappointment. Too sugary, too sweet. I am not a fan of sugary fruit beer. This beer is comparible to Samiclaus. Bleeech. I wish I could get my money back."
"I'm interested in reviewing this again."
"D: The only thing that holds back the drinkability is the ABV. At 21%, you can't drink a lot of it (or you will pay for it in more ways than the hip pocket)."
"Well worth the ten dollars I had to part with to acquire it. Sam Calagione...I love you man!"
"Notes: Glad I gave this one a try, don't know how often I'll go for this one but it is definitely an experience. I have a younger bottle which I'm curious to try to see if the hops are more present ( not tonight of course or I'll be falling over myself.)"
"Clear burnt orange colour topped by a dense, cream head that was speckled with a few large bubbles. Nice lacing from beginning to end and fine foam remained righ through to the finish. The aroma was a good balance of caramel and toasted maltiness, warm alcohol, and rich American hops (mostly pine) that were never quite aggressive. Big, caramel malt flavour kicks things off, and the alcohol warmth begins at the midpoint. This is also where the hops pick up, starting with pine and changing to orange/citrus towards the finish. Great balance. Full, viscous body that's just short of syrupy. Medium dry finish from the bountiful hop resin. Considering the gravity, this is a highly drinkable beer that wasn't cloying or out of balance. Very enjoyable."
"2004 Vintage I believe. Pours a crystal clear orange, big white head forms and never leaves, tons of lace, one of the prettiest beers I've ever seen. Smell is piney caramel and alcohol, very strong but smells great. Taste is caramel, pine, some citrus, and a little bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is amazingly thick, low carbonation, very warming from the throat on down, slight alcohol burn. The warming/burn is really the only alcohol presence you get, besides the fact thatr 6 oz will give you a mean buzz. Very surprisingly drinkable, it was a shame to see the end of the glass. Very underrated in my opinion, this beer is a feat. Good on you for the pickup DrJay."
"this isn't really a double ipa, it's more of a strong ale. i can put away hercules like nobody's business, this thing is a digestif at best. take it carefully and enjoy every sip- you won't regret spending some time with the humongous dogfish."
"I can't wait for the 2005 batch in October."
"I am not the biggest fan of beers with high alcoholic content, but I really enjoy this one. The sweet taste of it is savory, and reminds me of drinking a huge glass of port wine."
"Not as hoppy as I expected, nor as it should be, a little on the sweet side. Alcohol is masked very well, and quite drinkable. Ended up sipping it though, not really sessionable. Can't really compare it to the 90 or 60, either, as the purposes are totally different. With that said, saving the rest for special occasions, and probably will cellar it """for a decade or so""" as the label suggests."
"A golden ale with hig carbonation and a stichy white head. Malty sweet, resiny hop, alcoholic aroma. Kinds of a bicuty flavor. The 120 IBUs are not very detectable. Neith is the 21% abv for that matter. I cant tell much difference between 120 and 90."
"Pours a descent golden color. The head is off-white and minimal. The smell is just awful, such that your head may recoil out of fear. The taste was not much better than the smell, the unmasked alcohol was not pleasant. The mouthfell was thick and sticky sweet. Not recommended, But if you are adventurous..."
"I had to try this on tap while at the brewpub. I didn't really like the bottle versions I have had as they were way too cloy. However, this is an entirely different beer on tap. The pour is lush orange toped with a lovely white head. The carbonation and the freshness really brings out the hops in the nose, full of heavy floral hops citrus, piney. The alcohol comes through with a heavy handed sweet malt smell. The taste is something else, full hop attack is quickly diminished as the malt sweetness takes over and the alcohol finishes and the aftertaste lingers on and on. The malt flavors are like a brandy a little sherry, also some full caramel tastes. All in all much beter on tap but still a sipper as there are many flavors to go through in this beer @20%."
"The beer is presented in a brown 12 oz bottle with no freshness, brewed on or best before date. I would like to say that I do enjoy a very simple, easy on the eyes design of the label."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I split this. I was barely able to finish the shared sample. Nothing is off here but this is a sipper for sure. It pushes the envelope and I have to give DFH credit for that. There are many beers with smaller ABV's that can blend flavor and ETOH like DFH does. Still, I can't imagine making this one a regular by any means. Worth a try I suppose."
"Drinkability: How drinkable can it be? you might ask? Hopped to hell and extremely high gravity--but done in such a way to make it an easy drink for the hop head in me. The real question is probably whether it is worth the hefty price. I can't buy it everyday, but it is still worth a try."
"A very huge thanks and dumptruck full of beer karma to Twilight for the awesome sample."
"Not much head but lasting ok and amberbrown beer. Nose is very much hops; citrussy and a nice sharp maltnote. Alcohol and some sweeter malt in the back but alltogether a very fresh and good nose. Taste is IMO overdone on many occasions. Too sweet, heavy and bitter witch dominate the whole taste. Some maltyness there but mostly sweet& bitter. One that would do good on a clear and sunny cold day after a long walk with my dog but to sticky for me now."
"I do not think I would purchase another bottle at this price point. I do especially like the 90 min IPA, but find the 60 and the 120 lacking in different respects. For me DFH is very hit and miss for my palate."
"The taste is not hoppy like one would imagine, but more of a malty sweet syrup. The alcohol warms, but does not overpower even with a 20% abv. There are tones of brandy. A great brew that is a must try!"
"Overall = After loving the 60 and 90 minute IPAs, I'm very disappointed with the 120 minute, especially give its price. It just doesn't really do it for me in the taste department."
"My first crack at this bad boy its been a long time comin,pours a clear golden with some deep orange tint with a thin white head.Citrus infused vodka is the aroma I get mainly with this puppy with a light nuttiness barely peeking thru but this beer shows its alcohol and hops in the nose for sure.This bottle was was bottled this year so its relatively young and very powerful,pretty syrupy tongue-coating mouthfeel.Very interesting complexities going on pretty darn sweet for an IPA very alcoholic the hops are asexpected intense but everything about this ale is intense.now at $8.95 for a 12 ounce thats pretty high but this is quite the experience,one other thing I notice as this warms a little not only does the alcohol show thru more but a tropical fruit flavor lingers as well pineapple mainly man this complex."
"12 oz bottle obtained from Sulldaddy (thanks!) and shared with MABZ in June 2005. Poured a one-finger light cream head that left decent lacing on the inside of the glass. The beer was clear and light orange in color. Smells almost like a crystal sugar with and orange character. Some apricots. Flavors start with hop-tangerine, oranges, a *really* sweet malty, some cinamon and then APRICOT. There is a tiny moment of piney and pineapple to the hops. Hop bitter and co-ho comes along only during the swallow, prior to the swallow, the beer is all about the sweet and fruit. There is a gentle alcohol sting, that in no way presents as 20%. The aftertaste just hangs around forever. There's just a ting of carbonation forming on my tastebuds that combines with the alcohol on the inside of my lips. This combination counters some of the sweet and fruit. I think this beer need more hops and some caramel. To me, it's just too sweet and I felt like I wasn't able to catch everything that was going on. Thick mouthfeel and mildly caronbated. The beer just sticks to the tongue. It isn't quite syrupy, it's just really pleasant."
"Not too highly drinkable, but I'm glad I finally got a chance to taste it, thanks to mentor."
"This happens to be the best IPA around. With its scarcity, it makes people only dream of tasting the wonderful hops that this brew contains. The nice aroma as you pour it into a frosted mug, then to sip it is like the nector of the gods. I loved this IPA."
"It's worth trying, if only to say you've sampled all ends of the beer chain, but I can't see myself trying this again any time soon."
"Worth a venture... be careful if drinking a bottle by yourself."
"There's no way in hell this could be a session beer. Would be better enjoyed as an after dinner cordial."
"Im an Imperialist you know..but this is a 'one-off' DFH 120-min Imperial IPA try for me, worth it and definitely and experience, but I wont bother with it again."
"By the way, I had no idea this one was at 20% ABV. It tasted like it had far less alcohol. More like a 8-9% ABV. I think this is a complement."
"This was my first """big ale.""" When I purchased the single bottle I had no clue the strength of it. I was extremely surprised by the high alcohol content but found it pleasant. The orange and corriander taste was very arromatic and to my liking. IPA are one of my favorite styles and this one seems to be a real granddaddy."
"Pours a glowing orange color, very clear. Small bubbly white head. Smells sweet and of alcohol. Some minute hop presence in the nose. Taste is very sweet upfront. An alcohol presence makes a very nice appearance. There is some bitterness and hop flavor to balance out the sweetness, but not nearly as much as the sample I had on tap. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, as expected with a beer this big. Not very drinkable in a pounding sense, but for 21% alcohol its not bad. The tap version had even less alcohol presence. This sample is not very appealing. The taste is not hoppy enough. I guess I got spoiled by the tap version. Tap version is at the very least half a point higher."
"Three-finger creamy/foamy head sits atop a slightly opaque golden colored beer. Rings of lacing throughout sampling. Smell was strong, hoppy and earthy, particularly reminiscent of grass, or peat. Taste was spicy, vinous like a barley wine and not as hoppy or bitter as I expected. Very smooth mouthfeel. A good beer, but possibly too overwhelming in terms of flavor and mouthfeel to use as a staple beer."
"Mild carbonation but appropriate with a nice thick mouthfeel. This is surely one of my favorite cellared brews. I love the big IIPA's and barleywines after some age on them!"
"2004 edition with the green cap in a 12oz bottle. Pours out orange with surprisingly good clarity and a slight white foamy head. Some rings of lace were left around the glass as it was consumed. Wow this has a strong nose, huge hop notes with a big alcohol as well. Almost smells like a hop juice liquor. The alcohol though quite noticeable really takes a back seat to the massive hops. The sweetness in the taste was a bit surprising. Plenty of hops going on but it seems its so hopped its a hop induced sweetness. Not quite cloying and the alcohol really plays a part in balancing that out. Tasty stuff, that would be better with a touch less sweetness in the flavor, but at this strength that might not be possible. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a coating sweetness. Towards the end of the bottle the sweetness really started to get to me which hurt the drinkability a touch. Overall a masterful job on such a monster of a brew, that while it does have some flaws manages to be great. Ill be interested to see what some time does to the 750s I have."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy amber color ale with a huge bubbly head with better then average retention and better then expected considering the high level content of alcohol. Aroma is well obviously very hoppy with some sweetness. Taste is way sweeter then expected with some bitterness but not as much as expected. The sweetness is a bit too much for me and even a 341 ml bottle of this stuff seems too much for my liking. Not bad just not a good everyday beer and there is a few strong extreme beers I would drink before this one."
" This is a good one for those special occasions when you need to forget the world for a while. Like when your house burns down or something. Two 120's and you'll forget everything. I'm glad I tried this one but I can't see me coming back for more."
"Comments - Hopheads rejoice! At first, I was not really impressed with this stuff, but it grows on you. The bitterness will not kill you, but it should impress you. Truly a skillfully made beer!"
"Savored a 2005 120MIN IPA tonight. Beer poured with a minimal head and displayed a golden copper color in the glass. Aroma relects of a rich hop bouquet and discreet carmel undertones. First taste is an explosion of hop intensity. The balance of the high alcohol content, malt, and hop intensity creates what I would call a suprising sweetness. Subsequent tastes reveal the depths of the malt and hop mingling. The warming effect of the alcohol is evident, but not as intense as in the high-alcohol barleywine and stout offering by Dogfish Head. This beer is a tribute to the power of the hop and is to be treasured."
"The only thing really overwhelming about this beer is the amount of alcohol. It can be pretty safely described as DF 90 Minute IPA with twice the alcohol, but no more taste. That's not necessarily bad, but the 10% ABV of the 90 is more than enough for me. This would make a good sipper to substitute for a whisky or scotch."
"Like a hermits crucifix;"
"It was a hell of an experience, one that I think I was glad to have, if I remember it right through the haze. One word of advice... if you're going to try this, don't do it in under an hour. Unless you plan on going to sleep early."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy orange copper with a small off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, funny pine aroma like a mix of Pine-Sol cleaner and Off insect repellent. Super sweet orange, maple syrup and alcohol flavors. Full bodied with a thick sticky syrupy mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering sweetness. A 12 oz bottle is too much for me, after only a few sips I am done...way too sweet, hard to dump such an expensive beer but I have no choice."
"The beer pours a hazy reddish gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a warm pale malt scent with a smooth floral hop aroma that balances the elevated abv. nicely. The taste is good. It has a rich and tasety pale malt flavor with some carapils and a warm finish. It is rich in hops as well with a very complex hop palate. It is sweet and satisfying. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent beer that goes down slow, but is a good drinker. I love hops."
" Drinkability is not good way to sweet to be drinkable for me. Still this is a beer everyone try atleast once just to experience it"
"Like I said, I like this much better than the cellared bottled I've had. It's far less sweet, and has a lot better hop profile. I think another 3-4 months may help round it out and mellow the heat a bit, but it tastes pretty damn amazing now!"
"Drinkability/notes: A most interesting creation, quite difficult to categorize. Those expecting over the top hop bitterness will be disappointed; it has a very high alcoholic content, but this goes largely unnoticed until afterwards, so it lacks a significant characteristic of Old Ale or Barley wine. Well worth a try, if only to ponder over. Considering the alcoholic content, a beer that is best shared, rather than consumed alone in silence."
"Well, I do consider myself a hophead so let's see. It pours a cloudy copper color with a decent head out of the 12oz bottle. The aroma is definately hops, overpowering any malt and even that 21% alcohol. My first guess is a citrusy centennial or amarillo hop, but as I let it sit my nose tells me piney northern brewer, or possibly chinook. The flavor is surprisingly harsh, with the hop flavor being somewhat grassy and medicinal. There just doesn't seem to be enough malt flavor to balance the hops. I am impressed at the subdued nature of the alcohol. My palate seems a little sore from the harshness. Overall, I like what they are doing, and the idea, and the product delivers in the aroma, but I was disappointed with the overall product."
"Pours to a deep golden color with minimal white head and a bit of lacing. The aroma is citrusy with a bit of grapefruit, balanced out by a solid malt backbone. Alcohol is present in the aroma as well. The flavor is malty and sugary sweet. It has a citrus hop flavor throughout, along with alcohol. It is medium-full in body and easy drinking considering its strength. Not a bad brew. Well balanced. I thought that this was going to be over the top bitter, but that was not the case. Nice."
"I violated my review rules and read another review before I wrote this one. Here's why - I had different experience with the same tap: Spuyten Duyvel, Bkln 11/27/04. Ok, yeah, its stong as hell and yes kinda like bourbon. I found it to be frighteningly drinkable though. I did only have one, so as not to make the early morning rain swept holiday traffic commute back to Boston that much worse. It was well hopped but also well balanced - quite an accomplishment at its strength. I had a hard time believing it was 20%, sure its a sipper, but I didn't labor to finish it. Maybe it was at the magic spot in the keg, maybe the Cantillon I had before it was the perfect warmup, or maybe I have alien DNA but I found 120 to be a real pleasure. I have the impression that in the bottle this is much more of a beast but the magic of the tap's introducing some air and letting out some of the demon spirit really tamed it."
"I don't think this beer is very drinkable. As a matter of fact, it's only a sipper. It just doesn't go down easy. But I think that's how it's meant to be, one glass and you're done. But it was a struggle, even if it was only one glass."
"Beer is good. Happy 20% ABV beering."
"The taste hit right away with a massive flow of sweet malt. Too much in my opinion.(perhaps I should have let it sit longer than the 6months) It seemed more like sugar water than a beer since it was on the lower side of carbonation. Not much of a hoppy bite like in the traditional IPA. I will give it this; being 20% abv I was expecting a very strong alcohol taste, it wasnt there it was smooth in the texture and taste."
"Cheers..."
"I wanted to wait for a few years to crack this, but I had a hardon (almost literally) when I got this bottle and I knew I couldn't wait...i am glad I didn't...but I know the next bottle will sit for a year or so!"
"regarding the other reviews, I suspect this wouldnt be as good in a bottle, but I was lucky to get it on tap (4 oz serving in a snifter). You don't immediately sense the alcohol at all, and the light brown color throws you off (but seems consistent with the style). I too thought that at 20% + it might be barley wine style-ish but on tap it was not nearly as syrupy as say foghorn or bigfoot. Dogfish hit a homerun in my book, for this depth this is unreal. You could slug this stuff if challenged but yet sipping provided a much nicer experience. I really did not feel an overwhelming alcohol nose or flavor. It flowed nicely with barely any head, correct carbonation, just enough to slide over the tongue. After a little 4 oz version the alcohol hits you, the strength on the start is way less than barley wine in notice-ability imo, although I understand the comparison. It was very light feeling on the stomach consisdering the strength of the brew. It had a nice light mahogany color, and very clear, not much lace on the glass after sips. On tap, this is an absolutely great beer, on bottle? Read the other reviews."
"First of all, let me say that I think Dogfish Head is one of the best craft brewerys in the world. Now after saying that I have tried alot of thier beers and have been looking for the 120. I bought a bottle of it for 17 dollars and rushed home to taste it. I was immediately dissapointed. It is a good beer however I love hoppy beer and looked as though this one would be the holly grail (it wasn't). Very Sweet and alcoholic, which drowns out alot of the hop flavors. This is a great barley wine and should be classified as a barley wine. I haven't had a beer that has beat my expectations of 90 minute IPA. i thought this one would do it, and it didn't."
"After hearing and reading so much about this brew, I expected transcendence. Those lofty expectations were likely unjust, but the beer seems to have missed more modest marks. While it's lovely, a light and fiery red orange, the brew seems surprisingly simple. There are three notes that show up repeatedly- resinous hops, sugary sweetness, and alcohol. The beer smells and tastes the same. It's oversweet, tasting more like a sweetened barleywine than an IPA. I could almost feel the sugars crystallizing on my tongue. The beer feels saturated with sugar. For a sipping beer, this brew was almost, but not quite, tedious to drink."
" Man I could have a few of these!!!! 20%? Where? Didnt know what to expect-had heard a few negatives but this is a killer beer. Would love to have it on tap and """Randallized"""-I can just imagine."
"Pouring violently gives a small, dense, white head. The beer is hazy, coppery amber and clears as it sits. It has a sweet, rich, nutty, piney, grapefruity, plum pudding nose. It's a very nice hop perfume. The beer starts hugely sweet: caramely, fruity. Sweet malt in the thick middle gives way to a sweet, ripe=plums finish. Obviously, there are hops and alcohol in there too, but neither is overpowering. This is really quite a surprising beer. It's extremely sweet, and the alcohol is warming, but not overpowering. Very good. Better than I expected."
"Richly sweet. Apples & other fruity flavours are all over the place. Huge pine loaded hop flavours with a touch of lemon zest to keep it interesting. Tongue, throat, & belly are left warmed from the high alcohol level, along with some sticky sweetness left on the lips. Medium-full bodied, modest carbonation. Quite a unique & interesting brew."
"Wow! I expected this brew to be somewhat overwhelming, but it was smooth and delicious. I certainly could taste plenty of alcohol (Especially towards the end), but not much more than some much lower ABV beers. Lots of hops, and a great malt backbone. Overall balance leans to the malt, as expected. Appearance similar to other IPA's, and it (amazingly) had some head and lacing! I was feeling a little under the weather, so I broke this out (I've had it for a while). It has taken about three years for my palate to adjust to some of the truly over-the-top brews, but this was a real pleasure to drink. I hope I can find it again."
"I'm not sure this is going to be in the weekly (or even monthly) rotation of my regular beers, but I can see having one to celebrate special occasions. Would make a great beer for toasting with at New Years celebrations."
"Bottle. Gentle citric aroma. Huge syrupy thick flavour - spicky and shocking, almost revolting. Doesn't invite further investigation - in fact, the opposite. A gagging action comes into operation after a few sips. A true drain pour. A crude and excessive beer that doesn't taste as if it's been fully brewed out."
"Poured a dark golden orange, somewhat cloudy color. Small white head, was creamy then dissipated, to an out lacing. Smelled very floral. Tastes sweet, not hoppy as I expected. Warming as it goes down. Thick mouthfeel. Aftertaste somewhat bitter, leaving a taste of alcohol. Drinkability? Not all night, I'm guessing one's enough. But I will definetly have it again! Very pleasing and completely new taste for me."
"Golden yellow copper appearance. Very interesting. Slight head that disappears quickly. Smell is grapefruity, floral hops, and lots of alcohol. I really can't believe the way the alcohol hides in the taste here when cold but becomes so apparent as it warms. Maple syrup texture mixed in with an upfront honey sweetness. Lots of residual sugars. Alcohol, though hidden well by the sweetness, tries to offset the syruppy texture and cloying aspects to some avail but ultimately suffers. It does however provide another depth of flavor. Slight grassy hops lie underneath but are faint until the finish. They are stronger in the finish but here the alcohol kick comes in for real. I feel it trickle down my body warming me up instantly. That is very good and very intense but the flavor profile seems to lack a depth or creativity that the really excellent beers have. However, I am very glad I tried it and will get a few more to have when the occassion calls for it, maybe anytime in the Michigan winter."
"This is a dangerously drinkable beer, but at $7.99 I don't expect to make it a regular."
"Wow, very different from what I was expecting, yet no less amazing. If youre smart youll take the advice I did and plan yourself a special little block of time, with a nice meal of pancakes and sip away. Thanks John."
"Great beer, everyone, not only hopheads, needs to try this monster at least once in their lives.."
"Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but very, very smooth. Impressions are more towards a nice hoppy brandy than a beer. A credit to the brewer that such an outrageous product is not only still drinkable but enjoyable. The label says """Ages Well""" (mine is a 2004 bottle) and I am only too curious to find out."
"Not really what I was hoping for. The 90 minute is much better and the hops presence here is really minimal. A cool idea, and it's good to see someone pushing the envelope, but it's nothing special."
"Over-hyped, overblown, but I liked it the first time."
"The flavor is strong of bitter hops and a slight floral taste. Alcohol also permeates the flavors and the beer sits very warm in the stomach. It's also slightly sour and bready with the flavor of a pale malt. Sadly though, the beer is less complex than I would expect. The strong alcohol taste tends to dominate so much that any complexity in the beer is just overpowered. The sweetness is nice, but it does lack the complexity of a great beer."
"The second time I tried this I liked it a whole lot more. I have updated the scores to reflect that. This time I rather enjoyed the zingingly spicy hops and the searing alcohol burn. And the sweetness didn't bother me as much as I had remembered. Probably a case of knowing what to expect before opening the bottle. A shockingly different beer for certain ."
"I struggled to finish this beer, even though i enjoyed it immensly. My first mistake was trying to drink the entire twelve ounces in one sitting. My second mistake was trying to drink the entire thing alone. I will be buying more of this, but next time I think i will be sharing it."
"Nice amber color, with rather little head that fades very quickly, but as I swirl to get more aroma the head comes back and stays. Beautiful lacing and very small bubbles that stay, the second time around. Smells surprisingly sweet (I was expecting pure hops); some fruit, flowers definitely (floral hops), grapefruit (citrus hops). Quite sweet. Mouthfeel is very smooth and coats the mouth in a syrupy effect; medium to full bodied. Tastes quite sweet; again, syrupy. I am quite surprised by this because as an imperial IPA I expected overwhelming dominating hops, but this is not the case. It is very sweet, smooth and drinkable. Perhaps the alcohol will hurt drinkability in greater quantities but I shared a 12 oz bottle with 3 coworkers. Finish is long, syrupy sweet. If anything hurts drinkability the most for me it is the sweetness."
"The beer is thick and sweet, yet somewhat light and not nearly as alcoholic tasting as I expected. A fair amount of hop flavor manifests itself as apricot, tangerine, pine, wildflower fields, and a bit of bitterness in the finish. This beer is much more enjoyable than I was expecting from such a beast. It certainly could use a bunch more hop flavor (especially given the billing). In the end though the hot alcohol wins out, and is a bit too much. This is good in a 2 to 4 oz samples, anything else is just too much."
"Drinkability/Overall: Needless to say, drink this beast in moderation. Quite an outstanding specimen. This is definately one for the cellar. Wow!"
"All in all, I will never buy this beer again, and if I hadn't paid $10 for the bottle, I would have dumped it out."
"ok here we go, my first review. and what a beer to start with! heard lots of good things about this one so i thought i'd see if it lives up to all the hype. definately impressed. pours very smooth, appears a dark amber color. smells very strong and hoppy (duh). loving the taste... i can definately pick up on the high ABV (20%), but in a very good way, not bitter. it feels warm going down in the throat all the way down to the beer belly. excellent. tastes as smooth as it looks, almost sweet tasting/feeling in the mouth, don't notice a lot of carbonation. drinkabilty... well, if it weren't $8.99 a bottle i'd drink it all the time, as it packs quite a punch, but it's a bit intense for an everyday beer. a great treat every once in a while (or more). definately pumped about this beer, everyone should treat themsleves to this one. cheers."
"750ml bottle: I've been saving this one and finally decided to give it a try. It pours into the glass a fairly clear, orande tinted dark golden color. There wasn't much head to it at all. The aroma is strangely both strong and subdued. Very aromatic floral hops to the nose. Some sweetness in there also. The taste is potent. You know that it is strong, but alcohol is hidden in the other flavors. Malty, hoppy, sweet, suprisingly not too bitter, very complex. Excellent."
"Thanks to babyhobbes for giving the bottle to me."
"rich copper in color like the 90 min with a thinner head than it's cousin. alot of sweet malt smells coming of this beer. brown sugar aromas are present as well. it has an herbal hoppiness too, but it's surprisingly weak. you can smell the 20% abv too. the taste is not what you expect from it at all, there are some very strange flavors that i'm not sure i can describe, and definitely haven't tasted in a beer before. caramel and thick molasses with pear seem to be the dominant sweet side of this. the hops are present with citrusy, grassy herbal and earthy qualities, but not at all as strong or dominant as i thought. there are some spicy almost cinnamon like qualities to it as well. the alcohol is present throughout. this is a very unique beer. it's like DFH went so over the top with this double (triple?) IPA that it became a different creature all together. the body is pretty syrupy and delicately carbonated. i could do with with it being a little lighter. drinkablity is not going to be too high, because first it's like drinking maple syrup, and second an entire bottle is a session in itself. this was pretty good, i'm definitely intrigued."
"I am really glad that I finally sampled this beer after contemplating buying this on the shelves of some package stores. It was nice splitting this with a friend who had an equal appreciation for what this beer is all about."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Beer is a transparent copper color. The head was nice and thick on the pour, dropping down as I let the beer sit. The smell is malt accented with hops. I've been waiting to taste this one for a while now as part of my collection to share with my best friend when he came to visit. Here goes. Not what I expected. The hops are hidden behind a syrupy sweet malt character, but that's what you get when the beer is going upwards of 20%ABV. I'm slightly disappointed. The beer is very syrupy and thick to drink. There is almost no carbonation evident. I'm splitting this one with my buddy, and I imagine that we will take a good hour to enjoy our halves. I'm glad to have tried this beer, but I don't think I would seek it out again for a while."
"This beer tore my palate a new one, so to speak. I could use a DFH 60-minute just to rinse my mouth out after this. Won't be having another right away, but definitely want to drink it again in the future. Very hard to rate this one because 1) it's not to style, but that is not really a downfall; 2) it's very interesting, but flawed; and 3) I want to give them credit for their effort and experimentation but have to be honest that this beer didn't win me over. Try it, but go back to the 60-minute for most occasions."
"Hell, bring on another!"
"If you're looking for hops, like the 60 or 90 min. don't look here. The alcohol and malt hide the hops, but ask me again in a few years and maybe I'll change my review."
"After trying the 60 Minute and the even better 90 Minute I was intrigued by this beer. To be honest, I was disappointed. The beer is way too sweet for an IPA in my opinion. The alcohol and malts completely overpower any of the hops. It may have lots of hops but the balance is definitely not there. Perhaps it would taste better after aging for years as the bottle suggests, but I'd rather spend my money on something that is drinkable now in not in ten years."
"High octane and very flavorful. I found this to be much more enjoyable then the WWS."
"120 minute ipa is like a nuclear blast in your mouth(insano hoppy) and your belly(20.0%abv). pours a dirty gold color with a thick, sticky billowing head. smell is a hop explosion with a heavy citrus(grapefruit) flavor. taste is unreal. so hoppy, oily, sweet with a tinge of alcohol that is well hidden considering the high abv. mothfeel is numbing and warming- very sticky. drinkabilty is compromised by the alcohol content but, one to start off or end your night will be highly enjoyable if not interesting."
"Surprisingly very clear light amber without much head, but still a considerable sticky white ring. Deep alcohol heat hits the nose and supervises a very malty base, extremely sweet, caramelic and fruity, it made me think of pale molasses if it existed. Huge hop profile is mostly floral and grassy. Fatiguing sweet alcoholic palate, burning like a strong scotch when you keep it in mouth a minute or 2. Made me think of a sunny day, floral and skin burning. Very bold, yet pretty clean. Huge creamy body with smooth carbonation. Interesting, but ultimately not very enjoyable to me."
"Overall: lots of hop flavor to ponder, and the alcohol is pretty fun, but it's too sweet to drink often. However, Venom's review said the 750ml was less sweet, so I'd love to share that with say 10 of my closest friends. Also, he suggested this could bear some aging; if it can attenuate the cloying sweetness, this could be one amazing beer."
"Buy this beer if you come across it, and drink it slowly. Best buy I have ever made."
"Edit: Got an email from DFH on this review. Apparently the story behind the 20% alcohol content of this beer is a false one that the person who gave the talk at Shoreline likes to tell. The beer was always intended to result in a 20% ABV."
"This is one of the best big beers I have ever had. It comes off very strong like a barley wine, but then you feel the tingle of the hops on your tounge. This beer was a nice amber and the foamy head stuck around and left a nice lace on the glass. The smell was blissful. The taste was a deep round big beer flavor with an aftertaste of firey hops. Before you know it you can feel your tongue going numb. I could definately drink these on a regular basis however I paid $8.99 for a 12oz bottle and it is not available where I live so lucky for me I won't be going broke any time soon. However the next time I am out and about and I run across this sucker I may buy the entire stock. I highly suggest and congrats to those who have had the opportunity to enjoy. This is definately for the experienced beer drinker."
"Overall, I would say this is a good once- or twice-a-year beer. As far as IPAs go, I prefer DFH's 60 minute offering. For a strong IPA, I'd say Stone's Ruination is as good as it gets. This just isn't a pale ale."
"You'd think they could learn to stick the label on better though (every bottle I've ever seen has this strange rumply label)."
"Give me a quarter barrel of this and I'd be set...for about a week."
"Was lots of fun to try to satiate my curiosity, but will this brew become a regular in my cellar or my tasting cabinet? Not likely."
"Interesting? I guess. Drinkable? Not in the least. Bigger ain't always better, I guess. Goes down like a hop port, and that, even in the opinion of this humble hophead, is not a good thing. We'll she how she develops over the next couple years."
"D&N: Insanely good beer that only gets a four because it's got so damned much alcohol in it. One or two of these, though, are supremely drinkable. Huzzah!"
"This Beer gets hops added every minute for 120 minutes, while the wort is boiling. It results in a very hoppy tastng beer. This beer I had fresh at the Beer Advocate Art of Beer Fest. It has a nice amber/golden color. with a creamy yellow head. Most notable is the sweetness of this beer, which is something like drinking an IPA plus 3TBSP of sugar. Its very hoppy!!! I wouldn't recomend drinking too much, because the richness makes it hard to finish. But every Hop-head should try this one once if nothing more just to say you had it."
"This beer pours a gorgeous golden/amber color and is visibly thick (thanks to the two hour hopping process mentioned in the name)with some large white yeast formations on the top of the glass. The beer smells pretty good, very hoppy like one would expect from this type of beer. The taste is overbearing. The alcohol taste is very strong and the hop taste is equally overpowering. I'm a fan of IPA's but this beer is simply too much for me. It coats the inside of your mouth and even burns with biterness. It took me an hour to drink the beer. Only recommended for extreme hop-heads."
"Drinkability: I was definitely feeling it halfway through the session. It is much more drinkable than WWS or Sam's Triple Bock (the two beers of comparable alcohol content). I wouldn't grab another one, but I didn't have any trouble finishing the beer."
"Dull copper color with monstrous floral hop aroma. Hop oils evident in the mouth along with hints of pine sap, fruit, & some extra corn syrup-like flavor. High alcohol is masked well by the huge hops & the sweet fruit, but Randal may have helped with this. Mouthfeel is oily & finish is warming. Very good in small quantities."
"Well, one of those will do it for me! I honestly couldn't imagine having more than one of these at a sitting, such is the nearly overwhelming potency of all the flavors. Still, like I stated at the start of this review, gimme the 90 Minute over this one any day."
"as for drinkability, i don't think its very drinkable. its syrupy alcohol, thats about all i got out of this brew, but at the end of it i can say the buzz was worth the 3 bucks :)"
"This is one smooth, long lasting flavored beer - and it goes down way too easy. I wish they were a little cheaper...on the drinkability scale, I could have had this beer all night...and even had one this morning with breakfast."
"This is something you can get lost in. It doesn't seem like such a big beer, but it is."
"ng"
"Drinkability: This beer is dangerously, deceptively drinkable. It doesn't feel at all like a 40 proof beer. You won't be drinking more than two or MAYBE three of these in a sitting, but individually they drink like lesser beers. You'll have it drained before you know it, and it'll catch up with you."
"Too much of everything leaves my palate tingling and saturated. This is a beer I might crave in another 6 months or so, but I can't imagine having more than one in an evening. Or a week. I'll break one out of my stash in another year or so, to see how it's aging. If it dries out, I could see bumping the drinkability score up to 3 or maybe even 3.5."
"This beer kicked my ass. I split a bottle of it with my boyfriend over the weekend. Tasty but a bit much. It was a nice reddish honey colour, looked pretty and innocent. I wasn't crazy about the aroma. Not sure if it was my glass or something but it smelled metallic, also sweet and malty, abit boozey, not too hoppy somehow. It tasted wonderful, since I am more of a malt person than a hop person, and this was very malty. I don't know how DFH does it. And at 20%abv, my god it didn't taste like it. Mouthfeel was a bit thick but it worked, and drinkability, well yes, it was very drinkable. Again, it kicked my ass with its no hint of alcohol in there! I'd probably get this again at some point if available but I'm not craving another bottle of it yet."
"Taste? OK, DFH, you have finally gone over the top. You are one of my top-tier breweries, and your 60-minute IPA is always welcome in my fridge (there's a six-pack in there right now). But, I could not drink your 120 Minute IPA. This is just too much. This is at least 30 minutes too much hopping. In fact, the entire beer is too much of everything. Too much alcohol, too much sweetness, too much hops, my tongue is so numb I feel like I just stuck it into an electrical outlet."
"Pours a slightly viscous and musty amber (like a jar of new honey)with a thin, big-bubbled head. The smell is like airplane glue, though not entirely unpleasant--actually rather tantalizing, with undertones of sweet vanilla. There are hops in here, but I can't really find them all that well. The carbonation is immediately evident in the mouthfeel, and the taste is sticky sweet, almost cloying. I wish the hops were more in evidence. The alcohol content dominates this Double (Quadruple?) IPA, although its not as noticeable as you might imagine--unless you drink it too fast."
"Reviewed by three experts, some eugenecists some not."
"Drinkability: I gave this a 4 for drinkability because the alcohol is well disguised. Based on this alone I could drink it all day. Though at 20% abv I certainly wouldn't recommend."
"Poured a Honey colour with a pretty white head.. The smell is not what one would think.. It is sweet and floral.. Almost a candied aroma. Taste is sweet at first. Reminded me of some belgians that use Rock candy sugar.. Hops come in, but these dont dry it up like you think they would.. They just kinda mellow it out and give it a nice floral, citrusy sweetness. Alcohol is hidden a little too well, but you know its there. Despite the ABV this thing goes down dangerous smooth. The sweetness and the ABV lower the drinkability. I could take a pint of this, but dont know if i could do another, and well I probably shouldnt."
"Drinkability: The sheer ABV and the cloying sweetness severely negate the drinkability of this hop monster. But not so much I wouldn't try it again, and again, and maybe again..."
"Slightly hazy, bronzy-brown in hue, I couldnt get much of a head to form; all I managed was a wobbly foamy collar around the edges of my glass. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is a little dull, if not disappointing. I cant say the bouquet is telling me much, there is a big malty-alcohol sweetness and the hops are noticeable but hollow, vague flowery notes. The smells are more intriguing than inviting; regardless I took a sip. My first swallow was so sweet! Was I drinking a solution of sucrose, Saccharin, Aspartame, Cyclamate, and Acesulfame K? Yes, it was that sweet. It took a little work before I noticed the hops; it never even approached a balanced point. An IPA? Pure BS. Frankly it never became that tasty either, yes it was good but Im not sure why this beer is in existence. DFH likes to push the envelope and experiment but what is the deal with 120? The maltiness is not complex enough to be a barleywine and the hops are too drowned to be an IPA. The brewers did a topnotch job at hiding the massive alcohol content in the taste; the effects of the alcohol are noticed elsewhere (i.e. the brain) but the cloying sweetness is just too off-putting. It is full bodied, thick and unyielding; the minimal carbonation makes the mouthfeel feel a bit sluggish. This is a one-try beer for me, I always wanted to try it and I am very happy I did. Thank you Loki for the 12-ounce bottle!"
"I was expecting much more of an onslaught of hops from this. Instead I found less an IPA and more a kicked up barleywine, if that's possible."
"The long anticipated 120-Minute IPA was well received but not what I expected. The mark fell short of what I expected after trying the 60 & 90 minute IPAs. The malt character is more pronounced than the hops, which I feel, are better balanced in the other 2 brews. This beer reminds me of a Belgian or a Barleywine. Its still a really good beer. The color is a dark amber with little head. The nose picks up the malt and some hops but I would have expected more with the amount of dry hopping that goes into this. Its got a little syrup like finish but not unpleasant one. Alcohol brings a nice little warmth. I think this beer will be even better if I can let it lay down for a year or two, If I have the willpower."
"I was also surprised at just how drinkable and really good 120 Minute is. I could easily see knocking off a sixpack and then melting into the floor."
"Full bodied, not a pleasant beer to drink."
"This is not quite as wild (read: masochistic) as I figured. A bit sweet, but otherwise well-measured in its excess."
"Overall...a big beer worth enjoying in the dead of the winter....a good belly warmer and I love the sweet flavors this exhibits...Not an all-time great but a very good beer.."
"This is thick, syrupy stuff. Heavy on the malt, not quite balanced by the hops. Notes of oranges, alcohol, and more alcohol, and grand marinier, very warming. Would be great with desert or by the fire on a chilly winter night.Probably will improve with age, I've got one more bottle, I'll hide it better..."
"I found this beer, the latest in the entry in the """extreme""" beer category, to be a little bit over the top. Hops are promised on the label (they are both depicted in art form and mentioned in the text) but this beer is not about tasting extreme amounts of hops. As a homebrewer, I know that truckloads of hops had to be added to this beer in order to balance all the malt, but this does not taste like other double or Imperial IPAs that I have sampled. Far from it actually. That said, Dogfish Head 120 is quite different and I do like how the hops sort of surface here and there in this beer. They appear to be sort of in the shadows. Faint whisps of hop aroma (mostly a grassy aroma) combined with caramlized sugar. The malt aroma is so strong strong it almost reminds me of sniffing a cognac. The color of this beer is a light copper to my surprise it pours with a decent amount of carbonation with a soft white head of foam. The first flavors that I detect remind of a syrupy sherry more than any beer, especially and IPA. A bit grapefruitiness is detected as the beer warms up and a hop bitterness also emerges. The finish is otherwise dry and grows more bitter as the beer warms up. I liked this beer, and I loved the interplay between the massive amount of hops and malt, but I did not find this too be the extremely hoppy beer that the label and the hype seems to suggest. This is not an Imperial or Double IPA (this is reflected in some of my marks above), but it succeeds in pushing the envelope of strong beer, and I think it succeeds in being a very unsual beer which is precisely what Dogfish Head beers are good at being."
"This is not a session beer at all. Unless you soley pick a session beer on the basis of alcohol. This is a very slow drinking beer with its intense sweetness, and probably should be drank in about 4 or 5 ounce servings. Overall this is definately worth trying. It's very similar to a barley wine only more intense."
"I would love to try some other DFH beers, but this one was just not for me."
"Drinkability: Really too sweet for my tastes. I had trouble finishing my 12 oz. bottle, which makes me glad I didn't snag the 750 I saw this past summer. I was expecting more West Coast-esque hopping here: Cascade, Chinook, Centennial and the like. This is some weird liqueur. Oh well, it's definitely an interesting beer, to say the least and I applaud pushing the envelope like this."
"The bottle was cracked open right during the kickoff of the Super Bowl. The appearance surprised me. I kind of was expecting something less, I dunno, sedate looking. It poured a dark clear amber with a very small head. The smell was very malty with a lot of alcohol. Now as to the taste, very caramel malty sweet then when it felt like it was too sweet the bitter/citrus hop flavors just take over, followed by the heavy alcohol after taste. I also detected hints of what tasted like pineapple? Crazy! This is an extreme beer. Not for the faint of heart, very exaggerated flavors in every way. Mouthfeel was surprisingly good, although I swear I could feel the alcohol evaporating off my lips. I gave the drinkability a high rating only because it went down waaaay smoother than I expected. However I don't know if I'd really drink more than one in a row. This beer begs to ask the question, """can there ever be too much of a good thing?""" I recommend this to the hop heads and extreme beer lovers. Although to the hop heads expect alot of sweet malt in order to balance out the profuse usage of hops. Hopefully you won't be as suprised by the sweetness as I was."
"Great beer. Really strong almost like barleywine. Subtle in alcohol, not noticable. But be careful it sure is there. I think its 20%. Good winter beer, really warms you up. Smooth flavors. Full bodied beer. Great beer from Dogfish head. Very enjoyable. Malty and hoppy. Copper in color. I really liked this beer."
"'03 bottling. This brew looks innocent enough. Pours a clear amber with virtually no head. The aroma? Alcohol. I felt my nose hairs singe and my eyes blurred. There may have been some other scents in there as well, but they were lost after the damage to my mucous membranes. The funny thing was how non-prevalent the alcohol was in the taste. It was sweet and fruity with apricot tones -- dangerously pleasant, in fact, considering the ABV. I didn't even detect bitterness or alcohol in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was substantial, syrupy, and like chewing on moist dried fruit. I was torn on the drinkability rating -- no way I could pound these back, but it went down pretty smoothly. I'm going to cellar a few of these ..."
"Drinkability is low around sippability but not for lack of flavor rather just too heavy."
" Way over the top and difficult to drink for me. So much alcohol is distracting and not really enjoyable. Almost sickeningly sweet , massive hop flavors and over the top alcohol all sound like things I might enjoy but doesnt really work for me here. Hard for me to finish 12oz. I should have saved this bottle and shared it w/ 2 or 3 others. Sipping 3-4 oz and saying """ Holy shit!""" w/ friends is the way to go w/ this beer."
"i have to admit that this one frightened me a bit, as it's abv is way higher than anything i've sampled in the past. i was anticipating the alcohol flavour to be just overpowering. thankfully, it was not. this one pours a nice amber colour with a tiny white head that has decent lacing effects. it smells hoppy as hell. wow. fruit, bread and earth notes can also be detected here. the taste is definitely less hoppy than the smell and more mild than expected for the 120. it is actually very fruity with a tropical/citrus flavouring to it. alcohol is apparent throughout but nicely intermingled with the rest of the flavours here. there is a bit of a tart, dry hop finish. different, but good. i'd sample this one again, but it's just too strong to throw back (and by throw back i mean take 1.5 - 2 hours to drink it, like i did) on a regular basis."
"This was a small 12 oz. bottle. Beer poured still and a rosy amber color and a gentle whiff of hops. Whew what a taste. It tastes like a cross between mead with its honey alcohol warmth and an IPA. Rich, thick and sweet  maybe a bit too sweet or too young. Definite tastes of melon, and raisins. It tastes like an ice wine or a good desert wine. This beer was brewed in 2003 and the label says it will age a decade but hard to believe with no sediment."
"Taste is ultra sweet, damn near cloying sugary sweetness, massive tropical fruitiness that coats the mouth, substantial hoppiness....not nearly as bitter as you'd expect, and a gargantuan warming alcohol that warms throat, chest and stomach. Midtaste I'm getting residual sugariness for the malt that lasts and lasts, alcohol vapors that fill the roof of my mouth and damn near fill my sinuses, mixed with the hoppiness. Finishes long, lush and bold. Don't quite know what to make of all the sweetness as it masks alot of the subtleties contained within, but I'm glad I got to try this monsterous ale. Gets high points for appearance and aroma, but low marks for the rest of the catagories. Caveat Emptor!"
"And it indeed, as another reviewer mentioned a possibility of, goes fantastically well with pancakes. Seriously. Why else would I be reviewing this beer at 9:30 in the morning - I planned this! ;-)"
"My only complaint is that this tastes *nothing* like any other double/imperial IPA I've tasted. It's overpoweringly sweet. If you're looking for the height of bitterness, it's not to be found here. This beer baffles me, and it comes back to the bit on the label claiming to be """the holy grail for hopheads," which this is definitely not. That doesn't stop it from being delicious though, so seek out and try this unique brew."
"A slight chill haze yellowy-orange color, very thin white head barely lasts, but not expected really much there with the 20%. Fairly good amounts of delicately thin lacing though. Not much aroma wise, mostly some very soft butterscotch-like warmth in alcohol, seemingly malty sweet mostly with light touches of waxy fresh hops. Taste is quite warm, moderate malty sweetness mostly, a bit complex yet mild, subdued fruityness of melons and a few darkened qualities with yellow raisin and fig. Some toffee and butterscotch meld together with a schnapps-like boozy warmth. Ends with a little extra kick of warmth, somewhat port-like and/or even vinous in character. Feel is well rounded, smooth, clean, and pretty full with a little burn of booze nearer the end and has some nice lingering sweetened mixtures that come through late in the finish...ah yes more malts...and more warmth. This is a major sipper and a great warmer-upper. I can see how some would be put off by its unusual presense and unexpected character, I went in with an open mind not trying to judge it from what I knew about the long hopping process this brew has. I was either expecting something overly hoppy or heavy malted, its the later, more like a sweeter aged barleywine then anything. Quite nice. Big thanks to jeffboo for the bottle!"
"The beer poured a thick golden yellow with almost no head to speak off. The aroma of the beer was almost pungent and I could really smell the alcohol. Has this beer on New Years Day and before I opened it I let it stand @ room temp from the fridge for about 30 minutes. Tasted it burned my mouth and reminded me of a strong liquor ala gin. Waited anothter 30 minutes and another, the taste did not change and I hate to admit it, but I did not finish the beer. I am hoping that the beer will get better with age and will open the other 750 ml a year from now. I am crossing my fingers and hoping that it will get better. Sorry."
"WOW!"
"The alcohol presence combined with the sweetness makes this remind me quite a bit of an eisbock. The hops were nearly unnoticeable compared to what I expected from dogfish head IPA, especially after having tried the other X-minute beers from this brewery. The sweetness is a bit much and the alcohol is packing a punch. I think I could like this more next time if I approach it with more accurate expectations -- I definitely would share this with someone as a sipping dessert beer, and not drink it where I'd normally have an IPA. This doesn't seem anything like an IPA to me, and not really even a double IPA. But I doubt it fits any style's definition very well. I think this one could survive a very long time in my basement, and go through a lot of beneficial growth there. And it's definitely good enough to entice me to buy a few more bottles for that purpose."
"A prime example of the adage that you can have too much of a good thing. Poured a rather odd, hazy golden - it almost had a thick, syrupy appearance. The flavor was an unusual syrupy sweet hoppyness, like a mutant barleywine. A brutal bittersweetness marked the finish, one that was simply hard to get down. No depth to the flavor, just hops boiled in simple syrup. The 60 and 90 Minute IPA's are good - this was, without a doubt, pushing the envelope too far."
"Rightfully, this shouldn't be reviewed as an IPA, but rather as an experimental beer. It pours a light amber with little head an lace, receding to a patchy foam. The smell is syrupy, with an understandably high concentration of hops, and a slight hint of malts and citrus. The taste of this beer is, as a beer, unpleasant to say the least. It is far to sweet, again with the syrupy taste with banana and vanilla, and piny hops. There are minimal tastes of malt and the aftertaste is very sweet. There is a fair amount of carbonation, but the beer feels very thick, almost like congnac. At 20% ABV, this is definately a sipping drink, not to be drinken like a beer. Its far too sweet also to be drinken like a regular beer. Despite its low ratings as a beer, I still find it absolutely amazing that this could come from just water, malt and hops. As my brother (GreatPondBrewer) says, this is """an adventure in beer""""
"Very nice beer from DFH once again!"
"Overall, this one is difficult to review. An IPA? I don't think so. 120 minute? Yep! Took me 120 minutes to finish. Yee-Haw! This one bottle has sent me for a loop. How could anybody drink two of these and still walk straight? This was, by far, the most interesting """beer""" I've ever sampled. I compliment the folks at Dogfish Head for pushing the envelope with this brew. I'm going to cellar a couple bottles of these for awhile. I highly recommend this for the unusual, complex, and ass-kicking qualities of this offering."
"Overall: I commend Dogfish on this complex sampling. It looks great, smells great, and even tastes great. The complexity of it is astounding. But it is meant for having one and one only. I reccommend the 60 or 90-minute for enjoying hops more. This is more of a gimmick than an actual beer, but does have a charm to it, so give it a whirl!"
"I loved the 90 minute, but this 120 is only a novelty. It does not make it all the way as a stand alone good beer."
"Basically a beer you've got to try to believe. But for the sake of your pocketbook, split it with four people just to get the taste and save your money for superior Dogfish Head beers."
"The color on the pour a lightly hazed deep copper with a rather smallish head that is spumescent in texture and the color a light tan as the lace forms it creates a thick and sticky sheet to smother the glass. Whoa Nellie! Nose big time hop floral, sweet malt, fusel alcohol, just from the nose you know this is going to be one bad assed beer. Start is devastatingly sweet with a thick malt profile and the top all rich and full in its feel to the palate. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops robust and delightful in their bite, but the alcohol rules the day, aftertaste somewhat alcohol bitter, vinous and desert dry with the hops, sweetness and alcohol all lingering on to the very end, what a Hoot, I thank my good buddy , The_Tsunami for this bottle."
"Been waiting to try this one for a long time. Finally found it in my area. Pours a golden color with very little head, but adequate amount of carbonation and it doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet and strong with hops. The alcohol and a strangely strong aroma also come from the beer. The taste is far from what I was expecting. It starts out extremely sweet/tart then smoothes out and leaves the taste of many fruits (and alcohol) in your mouth. The flavor is incredibly complex and enjoyable after you become accustomed to it. For a 20% abv, they hide the percentage really well."
"I loved this beer, but I won't be able to enjoy it very often, it's a bit pricy ~$150 a case."
"This beer is amazing - and not your standard IPA. It's just a little tooo sweet and all over the place right now. I think I'm going to take the lone bottle in my fridge and let it join the other two in my closet. This must age incredibly well!"
"It would be difficult to consume much of this. More of an apertif than a beer, and if the alcohol did not deter you, the sweetness would."
"Pours with a half inch light yellow head that remains for a while. Clear copper in color with a few bubbles slowly rising to the top. Aroma is entirely of hops, but a bit sweet with juicy grapefruit notes. The palate is at once sweet with a definite warming sensation. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. The start is sweet with a hint of dark fruits and pineapple syrup. The hops come in quickly with some slight grapefruit notes, but are not as sharp as I would expect. Some acidity from the hops sticks in the mouth past the finish, but even the hoppy finish it is still overly sweet. I really felt the alcohol in this one go straight to my head by the end of the glass. I couldnt image drinking more then one. This brew is a bit too sweet for my palate especially when I was expecting a high octane IPA. The sweetness and alcohol degrade the drinkability, and make it seem more like an IPA/barley wine. Not sure how this will age. If anything, Id hope that the cloying sweetness mellows. I enjoyed the 90 Minute much better."
"The taste is ripe fruit with just a trace of hop bitterness. A bigger dose of hops probably would have made things work a bit better. It definitely doesn't smell or taste like a 20% abv beer; the alcohol is warming and a bit mouth-numbing but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is delightfully creamy. What's strange is seeing the """Other IPAs""" listed at the side of the web page with the likes of Hop Devil. It doesn't taste like any IPA I've ever tried. I was beginning to think I'd never get my hands on this one. Thanks to RoyalT for the hook-up."
"Everlasting thanks to DrewS. for this bottle!"
"Bottom line: I applaud Dogfish Head for created such a unique brew. Unfornuately this is one of those experiments that doesn't quite turn out as you had hoped. I recommend you try this beer if you have a chance, because it is one of a kind."
"A recommendation for the folks at DFH: Put a Surgeon General-style warning on the label: """Share with friends.""" Who the hell put this in such a huge bottle?"
"This is dessert beer. Drink it with cakes, cookies, buttered, flamed fruit and balance will be restored. Really beautiful in this context. Somewhat awkward (and oversized at 750ml) alone."
"Drinkability  I wouldnt recommend driving cross-country and sucking down a few of these bad boys. You have to take it real easy with this batch. I did my taste and gave the rest to the wife to finish."
"A bit over the top in most categories, this beer is less an IPA and more a barleywine in taste. Rather than belabor its high ABV let's just say that the body feel is a bit too thick and syrupy, the sweetness not balanced too well by the hops, and its drinkability very limited by all of these factors. I'll try again at some point to see if my sense of this beer changes."
"This beer didn't really resemble an IPA IMO. Sure, the appearance was pretty good and the smell wasn't bad either. In fact, the smell was very fruity and citrus'y' with a nice warming effect on the nostrils from the alcohol. My hopes were high at this point. Mouthfeel was full and thick...again, not bad. Unfortuneately, that is where the average/good qualities of this beer ended for me. It tasted like a World Wide Light! Very malty and syrupy tasting. The somewhat pleasant fruity smell did not transfer to the taste. Drinkability, forget it. My bud and I split the 750ml, and were ready to be done with it before our glasses were even half empty. Curiosity of this beer's """gimmick""" persuaded me to purchase it...and at $20, it was a big mistake."
"Good beer, but I'd take the 90 minute over this any day."
"Calling this an I.P.A. is ridiculous. Everything about the flavor says barleywine. It has that characteristic buttery fruit aroma common in barleywines and it was surprisingly not hoppy given the name. Sweet and alcoholic and definitely best in small doses. It was odd to look at it next to the 60 and 90 Minute. The 60 was by far the palest but the 90 seemed just a hair darker than the 120 and had a better head."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy amber orange color with two fingers of head. There is a fair amount of lacing left, which is unusual for a 20% brew. The smell is very sweet with the aroma of citrus, flowers, and alcohol. The taste starts a little bitter, then fruitiness in the middle, and just the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is super thick and heavy, much like World Wide Stout, leaving a thin coating over the lips. The drinkability is fairly good for this high-alcohol brew. Something that every great beer lover must try once."
" Realistically, this beer might be too much, maybe it'll mellow a bit with age (says 'Ages Well' on the label). I love DFH, but the 90 minute IPA and the Olde School (barleywine) both do different aspects of this beer, IMO, better than the 120 Minute does itself."
"Corked 750ml bottle- I really don't know about this. Super sweet, syruppy and sticky, unbelievable mega hoppyness, very in your face, which can be nice, but they've gone too far with this, almost undrinkable. Maple-fricking-syrup to the max, with heavy citrus and pine. Too much, i'm sorry (Bottle-GBBF 03')"
"This beer is pretty bitter, but the huge presence of hops gives it a somewhat sweet taste at some times. It is definitely what I would call and Imperial IPA. It will dry your mouth out quite a bit, but it is still pretty drinkable. The alcohol is there, but not at the lever you would expect for 20%. This is one intense beer, and if you can chew on hops, you will like it. I will say there are definitely other hop loaded IPAs that are better, but this one is excellent and unique."
"taste..mouthfeel..aftertaste...finish..? whatever...too sweet not enough hop bite to be called an i.p.a.(imo) also a tangy aftertaste. alcohol is present and so are the malts , but where are the hops!? 45 degree plato , hops must of been hidden in the grain bill im told. d.f.h. has a lot of beautiful offerings but in this one i am disappointed."
"I quess this beer qualify's for the new classification I2PA or Imperial IPA because of its high alcohol content. Not much of a head. Amber / dark amber in color. The aroma is like citrus candy with a faint floral hop bouquet just as you inhale. Because of the high alcohol this candy sweetness dominates the flavor and the drinkablity. There is a small hint of hops flavor at the begining of the sip ( I sipped it ) . The sweetness kept me from rating the """smell, mouthfeel and drinkability higher. I would assume anyone drinking this kind of brew would know what they're getting into. This is a sipping drink to warm you up, not a cold beverage to quench your thirst. Oh and by the way I liked it as I am partial to strong beers."
"Poured a nice reverse cascade into a white fluffy head atop a hazy yellow bordering on amber body. There was tons of lace which does not surpirse me at all considering the alcohol contenet and subsequently the malt content. Smell was spicy and full of cinnemon, cloves, syrup, caramel and esters esters esters. There was a surprising lack of hops present. Taste was heavy. In fact heavier than most Imperial Stouts I have ever had. It was thick, hardly carbonated. This was the closest I will ever come to quafing a whole glass of syrup. It was incredibly sweet, a little sharp, but mostly maple syrup and honey. Hops were almost non-existent. Malts were all this beer was. The alcohol was not necesarily apparent, but it was also not hidden well. Hard to explain. The sweetness seemed to dominate masking the alcohol, but when you sat back and thought about it there was tons there. Drinkabilty? What can I say No one should drink more than one of these. An interesting brew that would be better designated a port or sweet brandy than an IPA. Many thanks to nomad for providing me with this hard to find brew! I will now go be drunk."
"What surprises me is that it's more sticky sweet than hoppy."
"This beer is wide and varied to say the least, I got a sweet bottle I guess."
"The look of this beer doesn't suggest anything more than just a standard IPA. Amber in color with a thin white head. The aroma is grassy with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is very sweet. Even with all the hops in there it's hard to hide the sweetness of 20% alcohol. Actually in my opinion, the incredible amount of hops is necessary, otherwise this would probably just taste like vodka. Instead it just tastes like a beer, but it finishes with the warming sensation you get from a shot of whiskey. This is going to be one of beers where some love it, but some hate it. Well I love it. High alcohol beers seem like a fad right now, but dogfish head is doing it right."
"Notes: This beer is supposedly 20%abv. The bottle claims that it's prepared for a couple of decades of aging. I would like to try it again in a few years. This beer is very barleywineish. It's a good beer that should get better."
"Tasty, until the alchohol hits the back of your mouth. The hops and sweetness is what I 1st enoutnered, the the alchohol taste hits on the way down. Nice lace in my super-tulip glass. Nice golden color through and throughStill thick to the last drop. Still a remarkable brew. My god more people need this beer. Sweet, yet enough hop presence to be known at the same time. Ma this stuff is too good for words, find it if you can, cause even my non BA-type freinds love this."
"Wow what a different beer in the bottle. Golden peach color. Fine white head. Grapefruit rind in the nose with lots of malt sweetness. Warm ABV in the sinus. Initial taste of pine and sweet malt then the bitterness of the brew creeps from the tip of the tongue to a larger spread of hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very smooth mouth with effervecent bubbles swirling around the tongue. Warmth in the stomach after gulping.Definately a sippin' brew. You can't get away from the pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Very different looking and tasting from the tap version I had in March 2003. Certainly worth a try... not as bitter and hoppy as you would think. It's drinkability is still there for such a monster..."
"...re-reviewed May 16, 2004...a great way to celebrate my college graduation, with a bottle of 120 that has been in the cellar for almost a year. This brew has smoothed a bit. It's still intensely sweet and alcoholic, however a nicer fruity apple flavor begins to show. When initially poured it showed that it still had some carbonation, but any head was short lived. A random bubble will pop up every now and then, but most traces of carbonation are gone. Although not really hoppy when fresh, it has lost a little more of it's hop flavor, as I would have guessed. Still an enjoyable sipping brew, a tad smoother and easier to drink after nearly a year, and one that should undoubtedly be respected."
"IPA? No. Super barleywine? Sure. This beer receives much attention, and rightfully so. This brew pours a golden color with a quickly-fading bubbly white head. Leaves no lace in the glass. Smell is not too far from an IPA with some aroma hops present, although the main draw here is an almost overpowering sweetness. Taste is huge, with a monstrously huge sweet malt flavor with hints of caramel and residual sugar. Hops are hard to pinpoint in the flavor department, but they're certianly around. Finish is oily to be sure, with an alcoholic burn as it goes down. Similar to Dogfish's World Wide Stout, this extreme beer is very drinkable for its overly substantial alcohol content (21% abv), although it's not on my list for continual drinking. If you can locate a bottle and have some funds to part with, I would suggest giving this special brew a try."
"Tried this after a 60 Minute IPA. Great looking IPA - beautiful amber color with light head that screams """Drink me!""". Strong hop aroma. Much maltier and hoppier than the 60 Minute version, but this was expected. The malt taste lingers long on the tongue, allowing extra time between tastes. This is an IPA to savor the flavors and drink slowly by itself (not for pairing with food). I bought it at $9.99 a four pack, and the price is worth it."
"Overall this was far from what I expected. If I didnt know before hand what this was I would have thought I was drinking a very young barleywine. I would like to lay down a few 750s and try them in a few years to see how this one matures. My hats off to Dogfish for the attempt but I dont think I would call it an IPA (strong dark ale perhaps?)."
"I normally won't review from memory but I had this last night and it was pretty memorable so here goes. It poured a very thick & light gold in color, with very little carbonation. Aroma was very sweet , along with taste, which was heavy on the apricots. Suprisingly the alcohol was masked well. It seems like Dogfish head can mask 20% beers well but fail to mask a 9% beer's alcohol...weird. Anyway, the hops really did'nt make much of an impact until after the beer went down, surfacing after the sweetness had receded in the aftertaste.A very nice mega-hoppy finish. I really enjoyed this beer and would try it again, not just as a novelty but because it was actually good."
"Overall, this beer is good, but bewildering. 120 Minute !PA conjures hops during a forbidden tango with trails of wilting would be suitor taste-buds in the background. Instead what we end up in this admittedly young brew is a sweeter strong ale with an overriding alcohol run."
"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery all hail to this amazingly revolutionary brewery that push the envelope and shake the industry up to keep things exciting. Here is one of the finest Imperial IPAs I have come into contact with 120 minutes of continously hopped amber goodness with an off white cream toned short lived head, but at 20% abv it's all good. Aroma contains a plethora off hop tones including those of the floral, pine cone, and citrus (grapefruit) varieties along with one very distinct alcohol nose butterscotch. The taste is strikingly sweet with overly ripened fruit tones apricot and plum notes very nice very hoppy, but amazingly balanced with one hell of a warming effect. Mouthfeel is syrupy and full carrying all of these flavors very nicely. The drinkability at 20% is straight rediculous and at 25.6 oz. beware don't crack a bottle of this by yourself because you might be tempted to finish it."
"Dogfish Head has another great beer here with their 120 IPA. Was fortunate to get a bottle from the trusty Vintage Cellar. The 120 poured smoot, pale in color, some white head. Nice to see decent carbonation in one of these bolder beers, as compared to some of the Sam A. products. Alcohol presence was well balanced by the flavors of the IPA, are similar but much more pronounced than those of it's younger cousin the 90 minute IPA. Good hoppy aroma and flavor, along with a good maltiness."
"I scored one of these(at 17 bucks I couldn't convince myself to get more)while on vacation in Virginia. This beer poured a clear copper amber color and formed a huge foamy white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and malt, but surprisingly balanced. I thought the hops would have been more dominating with the usual Dogfish experimenting, but I was wrong. A slight hint of caramel is also present with a touch of pine. The flavor was of malt and hops with a medium caramel like taste with a warm aspect of the alcohol present. The finish was a medium creamy body with a sweet finish and warming alcohol. After Imperials, IPAs are one of my favorites. As with World Wide Stout, while this was a good beer, the pushing of the limits pushes it out of the top contention for IPAs if it can even be called that anymore."

"Dark amber/light copper color. Nice off-white head. The aroma is very hoppy, but not pungent. Just a good hop note with a few alcohol esters. The taste is very sweet, with noticeable alcohol, but not like drinking schnapps (which generally has the same ABV). For all the hops, the malt dominates. The mouthfeel is solid, but actually seems lighter than expected. I guess all the alcohol cuts it a bit. The drinkability is fairly good for a brew this strong, but who in their right mind could drink a 750 ml bottle? I wouldn't mind seeing this in 12 oz like WWS. This is a very good, interesting sipping beer."
"I've been looking forward to this beer since they announced the release for May 1st, and it didn't disappoint! I called this one """beer schnapps""" today, and that's the best way to describe this. I'll certainly be on the lookout for this one in the future!"
"Notes: I had been waiting for this beer ever since it came out, unable to find it in Virginia yet. I am hoping that when I purchase a few bottles and let them sit for a few months that the flavor will soften and be a little better-balanced. For me, the choice is clearly the 90-minute IPA."
"is this an ipa? maybe in the loosest sense. an experimental strong ale seems more fitting to me. actually, it just seems like a gimmick."

"Wow. Apricot fruity, with a muzzy haze of hop flavors and aromas all over the place - not really bitter (actually quite sweet and syrupy, but not cloyingly so) but the hops are really trying hard to keep up with all of the lmaltiness going on here. The alcohol strength is extremely well hidden - dangerous. I keep expecting a bitterness to balance the malt, but that's not what this beer is about. There are a lot of floral, citric, and herbal hoppiness behind the malt that make this one well worth quaffing. A bit too big for extensive drinkability - NOT a session beer by any means. But it does work well as an homage to the flavor of hops."
"I bought some from the online source vintage cellar in VA. I just opened a bottle last night and in my opnion it was close to amazing. Nothing like the 24% wws which to me tastes like hard alcohol. The 120 minute actually is not hoppy enough to meet the sweetness but it is damn close to. It is a beautiful beer. Not too carbonated (like most beers that use champagne yeast are). It is actually hard to taste the alcohol. Nothing like earlier reviews from people who tasted the keg and said it was spoiled or too thick or gooky. This beer looks beautiful and professional and it is a joy to taste. I guess this beer proves the theory that at a certain point hops can get more flavorful or bitter in a beer because it still wasn't enough for me. Great job Dogfish."
"This beer had a deep golden color, with a viscous of a fine dessert wine. Nice lace because it just clings not to carbonated but suites me fine. Not too big on the aroma but still nice. Mouthfeel of a belgian with the sweetness which tapers down the high hops this has in it. It is amazing that this beer is so well balanced for 20.04% abv. This is definately one of the best put together extreme beers on the market."
"Nothing subtle about this IPA, or for that matter, any Dogfish brew. Deep cloudy gold with white foamy and fizzy head and plenty of sticky doily type lace. The aroma is mostly strong hops with a blast of alcohol. A medium amount of sweet doughy malt and very highly hopped with strong metallic and grapefruit peel bitterness. An In-Your-Face-Strong, wild and raw tasting brew. Oh! Little tiny bits and particles of interest."
"Maybe if they let it age it might help."
"That's a strong brew! Hazy orange amber with a big white head. The 21% is apparent in taste and quick buzz. Hops are big enough to cover most of the strong alcohol flavor. This beer is still young so there is hope yet. Right now, this beer is just too big for itself. Not as good as the 60 and 90 minute versions. bleh"
