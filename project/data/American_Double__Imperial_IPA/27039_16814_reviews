"Single best nose ever for me. Worthy of all the Hype. Had it fresh side by side with Zombie Dust - different style but still a top 10 beer for me, and Heady killed it. Just super impressive."
"An amazing double ipa can't get much better than this"
""
""
"Overall: Good but I would put some other DIPAs ahead of Heady."
"After all the hype, I expected more....too much?  Pretty much like drinking grapefruit juice.  I also question the instructions to drink from the can, a good beer should be able to be appreciated from a glass."
"I never heard of this beer until someone plopped a fresh cold unopened can down in front of me. My first thought was I love the graphics and the name. But i was a little apprehensive to drinking it from the can. But holy hell were the contents of that can just marvelous. My favorite thing was the aftertaste. Savoring each moment between sips, I found myself sipping just to recharge that taste. Man, this beer was just AMAZING. If you can someway get your hands on it. Drink the living shit out of it."
"Vey complex flavors. Goes down smooth for a 2X IPA. Can't have enough when I have it once a year."

"Was lucky enough to try fresh Heady.  Perhaps its all the talk or maybe it is all the beer that is available now, but I like others much better.  This is a great beer just not one I would search out.  I am very glad I had the chance to try it and would encourage others to do so as the beauty of beer is everyone has a different palate and even that changes over time."
"Great smell. Lots of citrus, some pepper and lots of hops!  Very enjoyable!"
"It's a beautiful beer. Amazing"
""

"There are prob 10 other imp ipas I would say are just as good."
"super crushable yet complex, will see out more in the future. How does such a small state have such incredible breweries I ask?"
"I'm a Vermonter.  I love Vermont and the beer we have to offer.  I would share this beer with whoever would like a taste of what we have to offer as a small state with some of the best breweries in the country."
""
""
"Wow, simply amazing. It is insane how easy this is to consume for being a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"How many hops can you cram into a can yet still make it well balanced and insanely crushable?  Pretty much the gold standard of ipas.  I've tried it in every kind of glassware imaginable but enjoy heady so much more right out of the can."

"What the hell is going on these days? Drove down from Montreal to Vermont, picked up 6 cans.  Im sorry, but this smells like Pine-sol, no joke. Pine-sol. It tastes gross. However, i powered through 2 cans. Cracked my 3rd can, couldn't get Pine-sol smell out of my head. Then came the brutal, pounding headache. Stopped drinking after my third can.  Was left smelling like a brewery with a massive headache.  So i cant help but think to myself, do those who rave about Heady Topper drink only ONE beer?  I don't know anyone who drinks one beer and stops.  I do know one thing, this beer is not to be consumed continuously for a night of good times. The stink of it! No sir, i don't like it. I don't like it one bit, and I'm not afraid to say so."
"Amazing beer. Lucky to have someone next to the brewery.. Haha fresh heady all the time"
"Hands down the Best Beer I've ever drank"
""
""
"I give this the 4.75, it's almost perfect...texture just needs a small tweak."
"Amazing beer. Hops for days.  Drink it from the can!"
"Had it many times still my all time favorite...."

"I am sorry!!! the Beer is cloudy as hell and better in the can. However, i came from around the world and have been Homebrewing for 8 years; just to drive countless hours and wait in line; only to take a sip of the worlds finest! Yes, it lives to its standards! I e-mailed the company and all the stores to assure myself and acquire some of this brew! I got turned down by both saying to follow the truck and wait in line. I did and popped my first can at Route 7 in Shelburne VT at 945 in the morning to find the LOve of my IPA's!! A very balanced and strong double IPA leaving resigns of pine flavor in my mouth many minutes after drinking. 5 out of 5 for sure and still to this day worth the wait as i did on 30-March-2015 at Route 7 in Shelburne VT. Thank you, I will do this again just to get a case. Chris"

"A treat every time I get to have one."

""
""
"One of the best beers I've ever had!"
""
"As good ad advertised. Poured out of the can into glasses because I wanted to see what a legend looks like. Really excellent. We are living in the golden age of brewing. Enjoy."
""
"Fantastic IPA. Totally solid. Hype-worthy."
""
""
"Exceptional dgipa from the alchemist."
"I obeyed and drank straight from the can. spritzy, splash of citrus. hoppy and toppy.  T slight grapefruit. F all other beers. Overall ... As good as people said I think it should taste. I love what reviews tell me to love and this is DEFINATELY one the worst spellings of definitely out there. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, other people have told me that other beers compete."
""
"I disobeyed and poured into glass. L golden and hazy.  S piney and hoppy.  T slight citrus and sweet.  F smooth and balanced. Overall ... As good as advertised. I love DIPA's and this is DEFINATELY one of the best. I believe Heady Topper is not alone at the top though as, in my opinion, Gandhi Bot and Sip of Sunshine are also in the same class."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was very happy to grab a few when i could. Sadly it didnt live up to what i was expecting. i guess it's all the hype on it being so limited in availability. Overall its a solid IPA just not the BEST AROUND... in my opinion."
""
"Overall:  I won't hesitate to call it the best IPA/DIPA I've tried.  I had a Sculpin immediately afterwards and it paled in comparison."
""
""
"Over ten thousand beer geeks have rated Heady # 1  for the past 2 yrs. strong. Cheers  to us!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not and probably will never understand the exultation of IPAs.  This one in particular.  It's so average, Nelson is much better, as are several others.  So there's your review for my """bad""" score."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank straight from can so I assume it looks as good as it tastes. Very hoppy with full pine/resin hop flavor. Good malt backbone which makes the flavor even more complex. Taste is best as the can warms slightly. Amazing beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Digging it.  Quite a polarized IPA.  It isn't trying to be more than one thing, it just goes for it and does dank, piney and rich as hard as possible."
"It was great, but not my favorite ever..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heady Topper for president."
""
"Had a Heady Topper. It was the best Hoppy beer I have ever had. I water picked, flossed, and brushed my teeth. I went to bed. I burped in my sleep. I awoke to Christmas in my mouth. It left a lasting impression. I'd love another Heady and will seek one out!"
"With all the hype, I was skeptical.  It really measured up.   Unfiltered golden color.  Volumes of citrusy hop flavor.  Long, rich finish.  Despite an abv 8% it hours it well.  Great beer, no other words for it."
""
"Amazing!!! Want more...but only available in vt!!! The anticipation makes it better"
""
""
""
"(I canned the look, no pun intended, as you are directed to leave it in the there, no peaking..)"
"Overall: what more can I say it's heady. My favorite d ipa"
""
""
""
""
""
"Was a solid beer that I could drink again, but certainly isn't one of the top beers I've had."
"I got two cans via recent IP trade and my understanding is that they were roughly one month old.  The first can I opened was not good at all.  The second can was like night and day!  Really enjoyed the citrusy hops smell.  Just not sure this is the #1 beer in the world IMO.  If anything I'd like to try some really fresh stuff and see how it compares."

"Good good god good good"

"great can, smell off the charts, taste is a never ending hop bomb and feel lasts forever.  Overall it is worth the hype"
""
""
"Taste was too bitter, the drink too carbonated, and without any redeeming qualities."
""
"Good taste. Strong to strong."
""
"O - Yup, world class. Will need to try a fresher batch! Absurdly drinkable."
"Bought a 4 pack while driving through Vermont.  Solid IPA but certainly not the best beer in the world.  I don't get the hype."
"If you ever have a chance to have this....DO!"
"Nothing less than excellent. My #2 overall beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can see why hopheads flock to this beer.  Even long after I finished my can the hop flavors were still lingering on my tongue.  Its impossible to appreciate the complexity of this beer if you don't like hops.  I am not a hophead myself but this brew deserves its world-class ranking."
""
""
"I love a good hoppy beer and this one is delicious."
""
""
"seriously the best tasting beer i've ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't get the whole drink out of the can thing, 80% of our taste comes from aroma which you don't get from drinking out of the can. Gimmicky at best - the 100 rating baffles me."
"Also, they really mean """drink from the can""" the 4oz I poured out lost the more subtle hop and fruit flavors fairly quickly."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed at CCB Hunahpu's Day 2015"
""
""
"Fiddlehead started canning Second Fiddle, and it not nearly as good as on-tap or in a growler."
""
""
"Unequivocal, exceptional, renowned, incomparable, in league of its own"
""
""
"For me, it lived up to the hype! Juicy hop layers accentuated by strong malt backbone. Deliciousness, straight from the can!"
""
"This beer recently came through Philly and caused a sensation ! Hope to see more of it. Recommend drinking it straight from the can, as the owner suggests in his video clip. Many thanks to Vermont for an excellent American Double/ Imperial IPA."
""
""
"A great DIPA for sure and at reasonable price. If I had access, I drink tons of this one. Thanks guys!"
""
"Good brew but a little overrated"
""
""
"This is my first BA review, but it's definitely not my first beer.  I got lucky and went to Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in search of Pliny the Elder and found out that they were serving Heady Topper.  The line for the beer went out the door.  It lived up to the hype in a big way.  Everything about this beer was phenomenal.  The first sip was almost magical.  Like the beer was massaging my tongue.  Every sip after that got better and better.  The only disappointment was when I realized my can was empty.  Perfect beer."
""
""
"This beer is great... but a little too much hop/bitterness on the finish. Have drank out of can, tulip, and wide mouth. Great smell and look... but not as smooth as I hoped. A bit overrated with the new era of imperials... there are a lot out there that are going to give HT a run for the top spot in the next 12-18 months if production from these micros can get up to speed with demand."
""
"I can't pick up some of the more subtle notes others have highlighted, but perhaps it's because I don't drink quite enough IPAs to be sensitive to them."
""
"Not that great. With exclusivity comes high ratings"
""
""
"Hops are barely existent, there is an inherent smoothness to the beer but it tastes of wet cigarettes. I wish I could say better things, but it almost tastes like a homebew that was not properly sanitized. But two cans from a two week old batch? What in the world. Now Sip of Sunshine from Lawsons was incredible, but this, not a chance. just awful."
""
""
"Thanks CTH for only charging $7. It was worth it."
""
""
"O: Worth waiting 2+ hours for even though I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers. Better than PtE, though I'd be interested in putting the best of Alpine or Societe up against it. The freshness of the can really shone through here and for the price (only $7!) I couldn't ask for much more. A great beer and a great beer experience."
""
""
""
"Anything in a can gets a Look 5. Philly Welcome Gig at Monk's. Two cans (just to be sure).  John was here, but appeared to be busy. I've said """get some""" before, but this may be the first time for a brew. Get some."

"Definitely lives up to the hype. From the first sip, I noticed some very subtle pine and citrus, which developed into this beautiful buttery-toffee finish. It has sort of an organic mouthfeel which I really dig; could be the fact that it is unpasteurized and unfiltered. Just the right about of bitterness and unique hop flavor to make this extremely satisfying. Killer IPA."
""
"Hop-Dayum!!!!! This beer is the Bees-Knees."
""
""
"Oh, and just for the record, it's good out of the can AND a glass......but make sure it's cold!"
""
"Nice. I wouldn't drink from the can. It has some herbal borderline soupy qualities not fond of. Thick and very full bodied. Lacks citrus. Very crushable but this just lacks all the hoppy fruity qualities I want in a double IPA. It's a good beer but I guess I'm spoiled with west coast ipas. I don't get the hype."
"A good beer but definitely overrated"
"Outstanding beer overall.  I enjoy it every time I have it, but it is exceedingly hard to get.  I liked it better when I could pick up a four pack or two at the brewery.  Alas!  No longer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wanted my 50th rating to be a good one. Had a good amount of this brew last year but only shared one since. Hard not to rate it as a 5 across the board. Ridiculously drinkable. An honor to partake!"
""
""
""
"O: I'm disappointed after wanting to try this so bad I wouldn't consider this world class the mouthfeel is world class and while a tasty double IPA it's not as fruity or tropical as I would have liked it, it hints at fruit but it's a lot more earthy hops and herbal tasting. It is a very complex IPA, but I just have had so much better IPAs with less work.  That mouthfeel though wow."
""
"Best I've ever tasted. The hops are incredible, but it finishes superbly with no harshness."
"There is a reason this is #1. What an epic DIPA. Worth the trip, the cost, the everything. Still, remember it is just beer. Some people hype it up to be god in a can. Too much hype can be a bad thing. Still, what an amazing brew. Cheers to The Alchemist!"
""
""
"Overall- Had been looking for this for a few years now and was very excited to have a chance to try it out. I mentally prepared myself to combat the hype around it and try it objectively, which was difficult to do after the first sip because its so damn good. Hands down one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
"Flavor seems to change as you get through the can."
""
""
"As advertised, one of the greatest beers known to mankind.  It was indeed worth all the trouble and cost it took to get my hands on Heady."
""
"O: Excellent double IPA with great balance"
"This was my first double IPA ever, and it's still the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to try it again."
"I find it very unique. The only other DIPA that I have had that is compareable was Mastermind. Very murky/cloudy. Not overly hoppy or bitter. Somewhat subtle in the flavor department for what I expected, but very, very good. Orange, tropical fruits, herbs, earthy, wine like alcohol. Just different. I know, real helpful, but I dont think I can describe it with any justice. What I can tell you is that it is very creamy, and smooth as hell. Sip of Sunshine is the only one I can compare body to."
""
"Amazing drink! Tried it with my brother in San Diego.  He was able to get from a coworker that has family in Vermont. Definitely lived up to the hype."
""
""
"Unbelievable balance. My first thoughts were that it's a fantastic beer with incredible hop flavor, but probably not the best beer in the world. However, now when I drink an IPA I realize everything the Topper was and everything the beer I'm drinking isn't."
"Soooo damn good. So happy I was able to try it!"
"I am a relative noob, but I can recognize a truly great beer and this is definitely one!  Definitely worth the try-though if I'm being honest, I am more partial to Gandhi--but that could be a Connecticut bias;-)"
""
""
""
""
"As good as it gets."
"Was lucky enough to have this one at Sam Horne's Hop Rodeo. The only bad thing was, this was the """mystery beer""" and it was consumed after Pliny The Younger. While it was a very good beer, I believe it's slightly over-hyped. I'm a West Coast IPA guy, so that might also be why. This was good, not great. Both Plinys blow this beer out of the water. But, hey, I got to cross this one off my bucket list. Never thought I'd get this on the West Coast, and glad I did."
""
""
""
""
"UMMMMMM HEADY.....UMMMMMMM....Give me more. Daddy likes...  The only bad thing is that it comes in a can.  Otherwise, it would be the perfect 5....Just reflecting on my personal biases"
""
""
"The best beer I ever had. Great taste, great buzz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredible nose and drinks so smooth. The numbness on my tongue after lingered a little more than I wanted, but either way this is a truly incredible beer."
""
""
"Not sure if Im just jaded by all of these wonderful west coast ipas at my disposal, or if this just doesnt live up to the hype. Either way, it was just ok imo."

"Gives me a reason to travel to northern Vermont or beg some buddies too. Just can't beat heady!"

"Unassuming, tasty, a true treat on the palate. Better get in line early if you want some. Many thanks to my great friends who allowed me to indulge in this fantastic offering."

"hoppy but not too hoppy bitter but not too bitter ..hands down the best beer I've ever had"
""
"Amazing.  The best DIPA I have ever tasted.  Even better than Pliny the Elder on tap (but not by much)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer. Worthy to a point of all the praise and hype."
""
"Murky golden beer with small head.  Huge burst of hops flavors, lemon zest, pine in extreme amounts. Aggressive and yet highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had out of a can. Drank partially from can and partially from glass. More bite out of the can, but great taste either way. Everything you'd expect an ipa to be....straight fire!"
""
""
""
""
""
"amazing beer !! must drink from the can"
""
"Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of white head. Big aroma of pineapple, mango, and dank floral notes. Tastes of grapefruit, sweet tropical fruits and then finishes with piney bitterness. Medium mouth with some carbonation. This is such a well-made DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can, in spite of instructions. Hazy orange, thin head, great aroma. Big, balanced, hoppy. A lovely beer, maybe not the best ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank about a third of the beer from the can as recommended. Appearance, from what I saw from the others who poured theirs into cups, was orange-copper in color and topped with a huge head. The aroma was outstanding, citrus and tropical fruits, lots of pine, a little faint malt. Taste is slightly sweet with orange, pineapple, mango flavors. The bitterness comes mid palate featuring pine, citrus peel, and resin. Medium body, thick texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish. Is it worth the Herculean measures to obtain? Maybe not, but a world-class DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Lived up to the hype and then some. Best dipa I've had which includes PLE, Hopslam, etc."
"Nothing special to look at, but I don't buy it for it's looks."
""
"This is a perfect example of why I don't like to include """look""" in a rating. They tell you to drink this from the can for a reason."
""
"Very smooth and well balanced. Definitely a great beer!"
"The beer is rusty peaches. Theres a bit of foamy toothpaste on top, but it's not that totes.  It smells like my grandma's canned fruit cocktail, with a nub of my buds in it. While I pull this into me, I note the medium viscosity balanced with a tight, penetrating carb.  My mouth wants a little more pounding than this. It leaves me dry, and i like being wet at the finish. Okay beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't think I have rated anything as high as this one. I honestly looked for defects in this as to not let the legacy of the beer sway my review and suck all objectivity out but damn, it really is worth every penny of hype it receives. What I look for in an IPA is balance. Typically when I get into DIPAs, I tend to relax my search for balance as it is typically replaced by too much sweetness or a touch too much heat (and that's in the best DIPAs I've had) The reason I believe that Heady deserves the critical acclaim is that it has re-written the rules so to speak, for me in approaching the DIPA. Yes, it CAN be well balanced and brilliant within the style. This one opens up with a great nose full of citrus AND pine somehow, without overwhelming on either. Taste follows identically until the sweetness in perfect harmony with the perfectly balanced malt backbone join in and combine every sensation together for one, again, very well balanced taste that finished with just a tiny touch of heat that reminds you that it is a DIPA. Full bodied, well balanced, pretty much every superlative that you can find in describing a great experience in drinking a beer belong here."
""
"Get my hands on this 1x a month. It's a blessing, this is one great beer, so smoothe and flavors just pop in your mouth. It deserves all of the acclaim, great beer."
""
"As close to a perfect IIPA as it gets....had the opportunity to have a couple at a restaurant in Burlington, and they delivered on the hype. Everything that can be said about the aroma, taste, and overall experience of this beer has already been said, but needless to say, it comes through. Its """world-class""" rating is justified."
""
"I am spoiled to live in Vermont and have ready access to Heady. I think, these days, people hear 'Best in the World' and expect an out of body experience or something. This experience is entirely in the can. I'm sure there are other beers that are objectively as good. I doubt there are any better. This beer won't fix our national deficit, make dogs love cats, or bring back Jimi Hendrix. It will, however dance across the palate in an entertaining way. My advice is to open one and enjoy slowly from the can. The entire flavor profile changes as it warms. I am sure many people have tried Heady that was shipped to them. Getting this beer warm is like feeding a wet Mogwai after midnight. I shipped some to myself when I was on assignment in Texas. It was sent on a Saturday and I got it Monday. Was not the same beer I sent when it arrived. For anyone who has had it this way and reviewed it, I really don't think you got it the way it should be. Oh, and about the can vs glass debate... if you drink it slowly the later complexity is seriously diminished when its been poured into a glass."
""
"Dry finish."
""
""
"Period."
"It's been said time and time again that this beer is either the best that's ever been had or exceptionally overrated. I suppose the only way to rate it is to hearken back to my initial thought when I took my first sip-- """how did they fit all of my favorite flavors in this can?""" It really is great. There are many either great beers that measure up, for sure. However, the more popular it becomes the harsher the ratings get. It is what it is, and that's an amazing beer to be enjoyed, not exalted or compared. It's in good company with many other greats that this country is producing. Cheers!"

"Great beer but this is a litle over hyped."
"This can may have been old, but I was expecting a lot more."
""
""
"Worth the hype. Doesn't have a floral aroma of some other whalez, mouth feel is nothing special, but the taste is as good as it gets."
""
""
"This beer is quite easy to get in Vermont with some planning and patience. This would fall within my top three DIPA's I have tasted. Has a great smell, color and taste and awesome finish. Not so sure about drinking it out of the can! I just prefer a snifter style glass versus the can. Only thing better than this beer is Patriots winning the Super Bowl!"
"I broke the rules poured from the can into a pint glass, oh no. First of all this is a really good IPA and I'm glad I drove to Vermont for it. Wonderful piney hop character and solid ABV at 8%. Very smooth too with great aromas and golden color. However I'm not so sure this is really the best IPA in the country. While it's certainly no run of the mill IPA I've had numerous IPAs that would compare to it or even be better. I'll agree with my man coffdaddy in his review, Jai Alai by Cigar City kicks its butt. And the directions were a bit excessive although I've had it from the can as well as a sniffer."
""
"I've had 3 cases of this stuff to myself now. It is very good. Being from CA, my comparison point is Pliny. They're next to identical in every way, except appearance. Great beer, better out of the can than in it. If you were blindfolded, it'd be hard to tell the difference between the two. As a person that has been fortunate to acquire so much and share it friends, trust me...it's overrated."
"Wow, what a gift! Sip of Sunshine and Heady in the same week? Pinch me!"
""
""
""
"I did the half can/half glass experiment and the can was triumphant per my expectations."
"I will admit that I consumed this prior to knowing it was rated #1 in the country, and it definitely was the best I've ever had. I caught a nice buzz that sent the endorphins in high gear from head to toe..need to find more of this."
"what an amazing beer starts off with flavors of pine very very piney and then out of nowhere comes a huge grapefruit presence and is very smooth such a great great beer Thank You alchemist you are amazing"
""
"its good, its hoppy but has less of a harsh hop finish. typical grapefruity hop profile but nicer finish. i like ipa's but don't love them. higher carbonation which i believe is increased because you have to drink from the can...so i poured half of it into a glass. i like it better since it's easier to drink. i got to say, for me its a 4.5 out of 5. (maybe less but i think i will be thrown out of any bar if i say that)"

"This beer is definitely overhyped. Certainly it's a good IPA, but it's not as great as others would leave you to believe. I think Cigar City Jai Alai IPA kicks Heady Topper's butt any day of the week. Found the instructions """drink from the can""" a bit ridiculous."

"I actually liked this better from a glass than the can. Furthermore it apparently no longer has the disturbing pulpy appearance of years past, and looks pretty good. Just a cloudy orange color, nice foamy head and all that. Definitely lives up to its reputation but I have to say if you don't have access to this, New Glarus Scream is pretty darn similar in taste."

"Thank you to my friend Matt for bringing this down to nyc. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is one of the best beers I've ever had and clearly it's one of the best ever made. Mine was 6 days old. Sensational hoppy taste with some fruity notes, strong but drinks very easily. I poured a tiny smidge into a glass just to see the golden/amber beer-  but of course drank the rest from the can. Can't wait to drink another"
"Lives up to the hype.  Great dipa.  Hazy golden.  2 fingers of head, lacing sticks forever.  Spicy fruit, loads of hops. It's a world class beer.  Glad to have tried it"
""
""
""
"Enjoying the last Heady of my 4-pack tonight... from the can, obviously. This is easily one of my top 2 favorite beers. The hoppy, citrus flavor makes this beer incredibly easy-drinking. Its a game-changer. Can't wait to get my hands on some more."
""
"Generally, I am not a """hop head""" so I really appreciate an IPA that does not blast me with bitterness."
""
"Tried this once and it was delicious. Would love to get my hands on more."
""
""
"Is this the best beer out there? I don't know. Is it a damn good beer bottom line? Absolutely. If you stripped away the hype and did a true blind taste test, I don't know if it would consistently top everything ever, but it absolutely deserves the plaudits it receives as an incredibly drinkable amazingly delicious concoction. I consider myself lucky to have had this can sent my direction. Again, Roger, thank you thank you, you put the rest of us to shame ;)"

"for not being an IPA guy this definitely hit the top of my list of favorite IPAs.  it's lived up to the hype in my mind.  I haven't tried the infamous Maine Lunch.  But it's solid...."
""

""
"I've been lucky enough to have a few of these. I'll need a few more."
"Tried for the can and poured into a pint glass. Just OK, PtE beats it every day."
"Though I don't follow the IPA craze, this beer, especially fresh, is the best balanced use of heavy hops I've ever encountered. It deserves it's high place"
""
"Out of all the IPAs I have tasted, which is my favorite style of beer, this is a close second to Maine Beer Lunch. Just to add, honestly, drink it from the can! This beer starts, well sits on the palate well and finishes well; wish it was easier to find, it would be THEE go-to for me."
"I wish my farts didn't smell so bad after drinking this gift from the gods"
"Heady Topper is an Amazing beer. I just wish Alchemy would consider glass bottles. I'm not a fan of the can."

"Been wanting to try this for a while, boy did it not disappoint.   Had a family friend bring home a case from Vermont.   By far the best DIPA I have ever had."
""
""
""
"Best beer in all America! Perhaps in all the world!"
"At first, I was kind of skeptical if Heady Topper could really live up to its rather large reputation, but after trying it I really was not disappointed.  Is it the best beer I've ever had?  Probably not.  But it is in the running."
""
"Enjoyed the rest from can. Smooth mouth feel. glides over your tongue leaving tiny bursts of hop bitterness. The back of the can describes it better than I can. I've heard such good things about this, I was afraid by the time I got it it'd be up on this pedestal and it wouldnt be as good as the hype. But wow. True testament to american craft beer."
"I am sad to say goodbye to Heady Topper but unless it falls from the sky I most likely not be tasting again which is too bad as this is a great beer and should be have a wider distribution."
"Great beer, but recently moving from the west coast to the east coast, I felt it was too hyped up. 3-way from a group of oregon breweries, brother from Fremont, and top cutter from bale breaker from Washington state were just as good in their own ways. West coast IPA vs East/English coast IPA I guess. Still would drink it over most beers of offered."
""
""
""
""
"Always ready for a Heady."
"One of the best beers consumed by me in 2014."
"Was skeptical of how good this could really be AND wow....Heady Topper lived up to the hype. Pretty much ruined every other beer I had the rest of the night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Believe the hype. This is the truth."
"i drank it straight from the can as i was told to do.  this beer was really hoppy and delicious.  i have one more can and i'm going to drink it ASAP."
"Tastes much hoppier than the nose revealed, unleashing an hop onslaught on the palate from the very beginning, masterfully balanced by earthy white-bread malts, which receive a glazed accent, as the hops turn dry, parting from their grassy, slightly tropical initial direction. The fruitiness begins with ripe oranges, peach and tangerine, while more and more citrus peel gets added. While the malts are indeed capable of setting a counterpoint to the hops, they don't got an overly sweet character to them, more like a biscuity earthiness - just the right amount to prevent this brew from being hop water. Finishes with a dry, long lasting grapefruit bitterness, coming along with quite a bit of pine and a distinct maltiness. Drinks overly smooth, while ending with an enjoyable, almost herbaceous, bitter hop bite, developing from the fruitiness, without swallowing all of its sunny components."
""
""
""
""
""
"Without question the best beer I've ever tasted. Look, smell, taste all equate to perfection. Heady is Legend!"
""
""
""
"This is one of those beers that lives up to the hype. The smell is similar to other DIPA's but the taste is fantastic. The smooth citrusy hops stand out on their own and is something I will compare all other's in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A true hop bomb. Not a pretty pour, yet aroma outstanding from can."
""
"P.s. I got a hop leaf in my can"
""
""
""
"Heady is a great beer, completely different from the west coast IPAs.  Hazy, yellow color, great hop aroma, nice malt balance.  Not my favorite Vermont IPA, though.  (Double Sunshine)."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the reviews I read, I was a little disappointed. Maybe my tastebuds were dulled from an evening of enjoyment."
"Overall: needless to say a top notch beer. I don't think its my favorite DIPA but that isn't because it isn't a superbly crafted beer. And don't forget to drink it from the can. the taste is better than from a glass."
""
""
""
""
"To me, this lives up to the hype.  Obviously some of the built-in hype is due to this beer's exclusivity to the VT region but I still think its fantastic.  Its one of the most refreshing DIPA's  I have ever tasted, I could easily sit back and have a couple of these on a hot summer afternoon.  Fantastic brew."
"Too over hyped. I think people rate this beer to high"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good double IPA, not quite at the top echelon of the style but very close.  The appearance of the beer is extremely cloudy, bordering on chunky.  Aroma is amazing with dank, piney, and fruity hops all interplaying with the yeast esters.  The flavor is a little bit coarse and unrefined, but super hoppy and delicious.  Body is fairly dry, appropriate to the style.  Overall, this is like a hoppy punch to the face!"
""
""
""
""
"Finally got a can, thanks Jim.  Took the first sip from the can, as directed, but had to pour into a pint glass to rate.  Poured a hazy medium straw color.  Overwhelmingly wonderful aroma.  The taste was nice at first, maybe felt a little thin on the palate, but each sip got better.  Small head with minimal retention, light lacing.  This beer is all about the aroma and flavor.  Piney earthy aromas and flavors.  Very much a New England example of an American DIPA, in the same ballpark of the Gandhi Bot. Goes down very easy for an 8% beer.  If I could get this beer regularly, I would have it prominently featured in the regular rotation."

"Hoppy beer tasty Nice local Vermont beer"

""
"Best IPA I've tried, by far. Sculpin by Ballast Point was comparable, but Heady Topper had the most fragrant nose and ever-changing taste I have had the chance to experience. Worth the two and a half hour drive (one-way), for sure. Drinking out of the can, as recommended, I only noted its light, creamy yellow color towards the end. Very smooth, and definitely not the most bitter IPA (as they admitted on the can), but I would have to agree with the brewer; """sometimes I wish I could crawl into the can.""""
""
"It's like drinking from a pine tree."
""
""

"O: This is one solid beer. Very pleasurable on the palate all over. For 8% this is impressively consumable."

"In heaven, when it rains, there is a pack of pugs that have sponges attached to their heads, once they soak up the heavenly downpour, they jump in and float down a river of liquid gold that leads to a waterfall of euphoria.  They willingly give their lives, and as they go over the waterfall, just before they hit the jagged rocks below, they squeeze their sponges and heaven's rain mixes with liquid gold and magical pug tears and Heady Topper is born."
"Very good IPA, had along side a Pliny Elder and both stood up strong.  Color slightly hazy, smell not very strong, but great taste."

"Drank one a year ago without knowing all the hype about it (hotel bar). Found it good the first time, better the second. Incredible taste."

"Every mouthful was different...I am really going to need to try another just to analyze the different hop tastes. Probably the most complex beer I've ever had. It was a truly amazing experience."

"I give the Alchemist team credit for the marketing behind HT but don't go out your way to get your hands on one - its just an above average IPA."

"Tough call on this beer. I received two fresh cans overnight that were both kept cold the entire time. One can tasted awesome, but the second had a smoky almost burnt flavor to it. I've talked to a friend that had a similar experience. My rating would be much higher if both cans had tasted the same."
""
"O: Falls behind a bit in look and smell but the best tasting ipa I've had.  Juicy balanced and some good hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"This review is based on a couple of years of consuming heady on a fairly regular basis. When I first tried heady I was blown away at the freshness of the beer and the overall package the beer brought. There have been a couple of times that I had heady and it was not what it had been or what I was expecting, consistently good but never mind blowing as it once was."
""
""
"Poured half the can into an ipa glass and savored the rest in the can.  Beautiful looking beer with a great pillow-cap fluffy head that seemed to last quite awhile.  The aroma of lemony tangerines and grapefruit is delightful.  Real easy to drink, the 8% not noticeable, and the smoothness is ridiculous!  Tastes like the aroma but probably even better!  Also I enjoyed the lack of a bitter aftertaste.  To summarize; Heady Topper was the most wonderful and amazing IPA I have had to opportunity to try.  The hype is well deserved and all my expectations were met!  Well done indeed."
""
""
"Drink out of a can, do not pour :)  SO delicious!"
"perfection in an IPA2. Not like anything else. Not bitter. Fruit forward but not fruity. Amazing."
""
""
"Tip: ask a beverage center for the delivery schedule for VT, sometimes a fresh delivery is available a town or two away from where you last checked."
"O: Fantastically balanced. Not sure that I have tasted the level of complexity that this one offers between the smell and taste (from initial to aftertaste)."

"One of the things that upset me the most about leaving Vermont and moving to Massachusetts... Now I have to drive 3 hours to search it out... But well worth the drive...."

"Thanks to my wonderful and amazing girlfriend I now not only got to try the heady topper,I got a few extras as well! these cans are a day or 2 old from the brewery so im happy as can be,will be a great christmas:)"
""
""
"The most perfectly balanced IPA I have ever had. Pours pretty thick with a strong head. Smells very earthy with nice hop aromas. Waves of flavors from sweet to citrus with a crisp dry finish and never wrecks your palette. I went out of may way to tried not to buy into the hype. But in the end it won me over, best beer I have ever tasted."
"I recently was in Vermont to try this beer for the first time and ended up with two cases. Was going to sell some but can't fathom letting any go. Easily the best IPA I've had and likely the best beer I've ever tasted. Believe the hype. This is magic in a can. Once I run out, I doubt I'll be able to return to any other IPA. The bar has been set."

"Friend of mine turned me on to this beer and I absolutely love it, brought it to me young and it was a super refreshing flavorful beer."

""
""
""

"Drank from the can as requested by The Alchemist. The anticipation of getting this beer lead to a little bit of an expectation that I didn't necessarily get from drinking this; however, I still think this is a stellar beer and will never turn it down!"
""

"O. An awesome beer.  Especially if your in a bitter mood. Keeps you wanting more.  Mysterious to look at.  Aromas a very nice.  Glad I tried. Soon I will try out of the can and re-review."

""
""
"I truly believe this is and always will be the best beer available.  If you love a perfect IPA, this is it.  It's a perfect balance of hops, bitterness, and malt.  There's a crisp-ness in the mouthfeel that I've never been able to find in any other IPA.  All I can do is hope John Kimmich at Alchemist produces more.  I work all year to trade and acquire Heady.  It's perfect."
""
"Overall, abundantly hoppy, but silky smooth, a damn well crafted brew."
""
"Still remains my favorite beer out there since the time I've had it four years ago.  Absolutely no way to be mad at this beer.  If you don't like IPA's, I urge someone to take a step outside their box and have a HT.  Drink this beer out of the can, very few places will tap this beer.  """Don't be a DB."""  Try it."
""
"Absolutely delicious. Tastes great with anything. Seriously. I now take the 2 hour drive twice a year to stock up."
""
""
""
""
"I get all the hype. It is a delicious beer. Part of the mystique is due to limited distribution though. I get it a few times per season. Best for a crisp winter day during a pond hockey set break."
""
""
""
"Is this balanced? No, not really. Is it drinkable? Quite so. Does it live up to the hype? I answer this with a question: could it ever have lived up to the hype? Scarcity breeds demand, demand breeds desire, and desire feeds hype. And what is hype but the unrealized hopes and expectations of a wonderful experience for delighted beer enthusiasts? There is no denying that this a great beer. I prefer to leave it at that."
""
""
""
"I hate to be cliche, but this is definitely my new favorite IPA. The flavor was incredible, and the aftertaste is just perfect. This is the perfect beer for me."

"O – Obviously this beer’s reputation precedes it, and it’s hard to drink it without that in mind.  Regardless, this is an incredibly well-made Double IPA, that I would love to drink over and over again, if only I could get my hands on a supply.  Best beer in the world?  That’s debatable, but it is definitely fantastic."

"Delicious"

"My only gripe is the whole drink from a can...I'm not buying that. However, this is by far and above my favorite beer to date. The perfect balance of hops and malt for my palate. Although hop forward, there isn't that strange aftertaste associated with some overtly hoppy beers. The alcohol seems non-existent. Notes and tastes of citrus (grapefruit in particular) meet a creamy and well-rounded pine."

"This Double IPA is average in its class. I'm guessing that many of these high ratings are more for the category rather than where the beer fits with in the category. I find this beer to be unbalanced. The mouthfeel is a little flat and the hops are all over the place."
""
""
"This was honestly fantastic beer (better than I anticipated, I thought it would be over rated). Best in the world?... to hard to quantify but this beer pushes perfection. I will say, I had two cans shipped to me, had the first out of a can and the second out of a glass (because I like to look my beer in the eyes while I sip it) it was better out of the can, though I also had it 3 weeks fresher from the can. Somehow this beer manages to have a serious hop punch that still feels balanced."

"Its the complete package.  Had my first can last night at One Mile House which they were serving for their anniversary.  Actually ordered a Maine Lunch first upon seeing it on their extensive beer list. They have it on tap. After taking my first sip I noticed the guy next to me drinking a Heady Topper out of the unmistakable can. I was shocked and immediately order one - now double fisting a heady topper and a main lunch.  The rest is between me and my taste buds, but all of the accolades here are spot on."

"Was lucky enough to take a trip up to Stowe and Burlington last weekend.  As a non-hophead this is incredibly drinkable.  The bitterness does not destroy your tastebuds like most DIPAs and the taste is fantastic.  I came across it in a liquor store later in the day and bought the limit for an individual."
""
""
""
"Well this beer was everything i hoped for and more. Definitely lives up to all of the hype. Perfect balance of fruit and bitterness from the hops and the malt profile balances them out perfectly. don't know if there will ever be a more balanced beer then this. its everything i wish for in an IPA"

"When Fresh (within 10 days) best IPA ever!"

"Pours a hazy honey orange with 2 finger white head.  Smells floral, orange/grapefruit.  Tastes of sweet orange blossom,grapefruit, sweet malt and pine.  Silky medium/full body with medium carbonation.  Leaves a great hop resin in mouth and lips and back of throat.  Incredible beer."

"I tried a can (as the can advises) while in Stowe, VT.  I had heard it was rated number one in the world so I wanted to check it out.  Admittedly,  I don't really tend to enjoy IPA's.  It has a great aroma, but taste was very bitter, for my tastes.  Also, it was not very sessionable at all considering I was fairly drunk before finishing the can.  Not for my tastes but I can see why it's so popular if you like happy beers."

"the beer by which i judge all beer"

""

""
"O--The hype is real.  I was planning on making a trip up to Vermont soon and even though I had  a couple in NYC I still plan on it.  Its an experience that every beer drinker should enjoy.  I know some will downgrade based on its cult-like following and limited accessibility but seriously this is the best IIPA I've tasted--I cannot compare it to Lawsons or Pliny though as I haven't had the chance yet to try them."

"Pours a glowing orange somewhat hazy tint. One of the brightest beers I've ever seen in the glass. Smell is unlimited sweet citrusy hops. So incredibly sweet on the nose. Like hoppy candy. The taste is awesome. Great bursts of citrusy west coast hops but also a good bit of pine. Surprisingly balanced in terms of hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard of a DIPA. Smooth and well carbonated. Overall this is such a great beer. Maybe not the greatest beer of all time but defimtiely something I wish I could keep in my fridge at all times."
"Is it worth all the hype? The Alchemist is brewing a great beer but I think the limited availability bolsters the mystique. Still, it is one heck of a delicious American Double IPA."

"Of all the beer styles in the world, a double IPA is one that I'd never expect to call gentle and smooth, but this one certainly is.  My only complaint is a touch of alcohol heat, especially on the first sip.  It creates a dissonant tone after such a perfect first experience.  Its not very bothersome, and I don't even notice it halfway through the beer, but it was a bit of an off note after a surprisingly great first sip.  After drinking this beer, I have a new perspective on double IPA, and I'm realizing that there's a lot of really bad ones out there.  For me, it's sort of like the first time I heard Metallica's Master of Puppets album at age 11-12.  I realized that most of the other heavy metal I thought I liked was absolute garbage or at least not as good as I thought it was."

"Well.... i live here in the great state of vermont. And i can get heady topper pretty much whene ever i want (im a chef, always have the stuff). This is a good IPA. I like it for its culture shock and I respect its cult folowing, however i actually do not like the beer. Its unbalanced, and dry hopped way to long for my taste. As a chef im always looking for balence and this just does not have it. But i do understand why hop heads around the country flock for it."

"On a trip up north to Vermont I realized I was in Heady topper country.  I honestly wanted not to like this beer based on the fact everybody likes it.  I thought the limited access was the majority of the reason it was so desirable.   Expecting a normal IPA with some deviations I can say I was dead wrong.   It was like nothing else I've had before but so familiar to my favorite hoppy IPA style.   I was a little unsettled about drinking it out if the can but got used to it after the third one.    The first thing I did was smell the hoppy aroma which was great. The beer was excellent, a dank, hoppy, piney, citrusy IPA with a more heavy mouthfeel.  Very complex   If I could buy this I would always have a 4 pack in my fridge.  But I'm from NY and the beer doesn't travel far. I tried 5 or 6 different stores the alchemist website states it delivers to and all the stores sell out in hours to a single day.   A bartender hooked me up with two cans after a couple of hours of drinking and chatting.   It's not easy to obtain this brew making me want it more.   The two in my fridge are killing me right now     I'll be sure to give one to a real beer guy friend who knows his hops and has been around the beer isles.  This will not be wasted on a bud light drinker I promise"

"Well I finally had a chance to try the infamous Heady Topper. A friend was working in Vermont and came across a 4 pak at, of all places, a gas station convenience store. Well, with great anticipation, we sat down at my home bar, popped the top on a can and away we went. First thing to hit you was the aroma. Piney, hoppy. And that's where it ended for me. This beer is better suited to be an air freshener than a drink. I was sitting there tasting what in my opinion is way over the top flavor finished with bitterness. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. With all of the thousands of beers in the world this is the # 1? Not a chance. In the end I felt like a kid who got a beautifully wrapped gift only to discover a bag of sox or underwear inside. What a bummer."
""
""
""
"O - is it the best hoppy ale on the planet?  From my experience some days yes and some days top five.  Abner certainly is right there, Lawsons too...harder to get and I recall a side by side on draft where i preferred Abner but there's something about scoring those 4 pack cans and bringing them home.  Heady is not for beginners in some cases but if you like hops this one will blow your stack.....I'll end by saying that this is the most dangerously drinkable 8% beer I've ever had."

Seriously, the worst I've had is still very delicious. I've had hundreds of cans, had many a sampler from the brewery when it was open and also had on draft several times. All good stuff."

"Yeah.  I could drink this all day.  And night.  And day again..."

"If I get to Vermont this winter and can call a liquor store to reserve a case, I'll certainly pick some up.  However, I won't be skipping a morning's skiing to drive from store to store to see if they happened to have gotten any in overnight and if they happen to have any left (which is what I've been told I'll have to do).  Too many other quality beers out there that I won't have to jump through hoops of fire to get my hands on."

"start to finish. Cheers to Heady-topper"
""
"an amazing DIPA, don;t get me wrong. I wish i could try it without having known any hype around it to get an unbiased opinion."
""
""
""

"The most noticeable quality of Heady Topper at pour is the amount of sediment in the glass. I suppose that is why they print """DRINK FROM THE CAN""" on the can itself. But, we had to pour it for the taste test so people would not know what they were drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When the can says to not use a glass you gotta wonder. Having tried it both ways, the can is right. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA. Layers and waves of hops. Strong malty backbone. Spot on carbonation and weight. A huge thanks to my great beer buddy Chris Brady for the four pack of this exceptional beer. I could drink this all day. No trace of the abv, sneaky drinkability. WOW."

"when reaching for an IPA."
""
""
""

"My biggest knock on Heady is the Alchemist's attempt at keeping it exclusive and hard to find. I've visited liquor stores that had plenty of Heady, but couldn't sell me any due to agreements to only sell it on specific days. It's a pain, but visit the Alchemists website and go to the stores recommended on the days recommended and you'll have no problem buying as much Heady as you can afford. I've always found as much as I wanted without an issue."
"I can see why they only made this for a while.  One of the best beers for sure.  I had it on draft a couple times in VT and it lives up to the pretty much lives up to the hype.  Hazy and orange in the glass.  Odor of citrus, pine and tropical fruit.  Taste follows odor with a great balance of hops throughout.  Never over powering, well balanced. Ends nice and dry.  Overall, an excellent ipa and an outstanding beer."

"At the time of this review, Heady topper is ranked on Beer Advocate as the best beer in the world.  I was up at Stowe in Vermont for a british car show and found a bar that served this infamous beer on tap. Overall, if I didn't know this beer was so highly ranked, I would have thought Its good, but not memorable. If anything, all the flavors are very well balanced. The only decreeable flavor i could pick out was mandarin orange. I think this would be a nice session beer, but this is absolutely not a memorable beer. For all the hype, this was a letdown as there's nothing memorable, special or unique about it. FWIW, I'm also not really an IPA guy."
""

"One does not simply quaff Heady Topper. It needs to be enjoyed with complete awareness and yet total relaxation, in the fullness of time, each sip a journey to an exotic Roger Dean-esque alien landscape, where you sit beneath a strangely geometric tree, listening to the far-off flesh-eating birds chirping, and think, """This couldn't get any weirder. Well, maybe if I were tripping, too.""""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What is most striking to me about Heady Topper is the smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  The hop aroma and flavor are fresh, bright and juicy.  The bitterness is about perfect.  But to me it's that mouthfeel that is most distinctive.  Well, that and the large amount of beautiful yeast sediment that you can culture from any can."

"One of my favorite Double IPA's!"

"One of the best DIPA's I've ever had the privilege of drinking.  For a DIPA to have so many aromas and tastes mingle so well with no one of them overpowering the others is a testament to the brewers.  Tough to get but worth the effort."

I just don't see what's all that great about this beer.  It has a good hop profile but I can think of five IPAs off the top of my head I like better.  I think I'll put this one to rest."

"This is a perfect IPA. World Class!"
"If the color and head are not impressive enough, the taste is dazzling.  Grapefruity, hoppy, raw, full, malty, bitter, smooth are some of the many descriptions that come to kind.  A great and complex drink.  I am usually jot an IPA fan, but thia beer is in a class of its own."

"World class.  Finding one can be a bit tricky though.  My friend got me one at a phish concert but I  was left with a feeling of disappointment.  I think they had allowed it to get warm which affected the taste. I then took a trip to Vermont and headed straight for Waterbury.  I thought it would be easy to find once I got to the home town but I may as well have been in California. I struck gold at the best Western hotel I stayed at because their cafe had some in stock.  I did end up finding some to bring home after following multiple leeds taking me to multiple towns."

"I do a round-trip drive from VA each August to get my case (or as much as I can get). Very difficult to get if you aren't willing to travel to VT and not easy to get unless you plan before you get there. I recommend the Heady Spotter website to maximize your opportunities. Worth the trouble, though. There's nothing quite like it."

"By far, the nicest look and feel of a bottled/canned IIPA. Big fluffy white head and oodles of glass sticking lace. Low-medium carbonation give it a very soft and creamy feel, particularly when pared with the medium+ body. Aroma and flavor are as good as you could want for the style. Lots of pine and a long lasting bitter finish. Residual sugars lean it a click toward the sweet side and there's a touch of alcohol in the finish. Big thanks to Chuk for securing this one for me."

"O: This beer makes me smile. Tough to describe, but there's this luscious backbone that screams for all that hops. Every time I taste it I can't get over the sweet homebrew note that counters that Imperial IPA hop blast. It's like a dash of salt on your watermelon, or a couple granules of sugar on a cucumber, it just works. I adore Stone's Ruination (had it on tap for years where I bartended), but this is less refined, more casual, less pretentious, yet bolder - drink it from the can or don't.

"Overall:  AMAZING!!   The can says it all, """so drinkable it is dangerous."""   My only knock on this beer is the availability.   I understand the buzz that is created with the elusive factor of beers like this, Pliny, Founder's KBS, etc.   And while the brewer John Kimmich has every right to keep this limited, I would suggest he brew more and make it available to more states (just a business take IMO).   Nevertheless, we ended up getting four cases between four people and have enjoyed this all summer down here in New Jersey, and will be back in VT next summer to get more (or sooner if we ski).   And while we had other great IPA's in Vermont such as Lawson's and Hill Farm Stand, this one (to me) is just so drinkable it is scary in a good way.  Cheers!!"

"Really enjoyed this but I do think it is slightly overrated. The initial burst of hop flavor is something I will always remember.  But the thrill only seemed to last halfway through the can, or my palate just got used to it.  Its an aggressive beer for sure and really well crafted."

"O: Well, after having this a few times I've noticed some variation from can to can probably due to factors such a travel to west coast, temperature, etc. This is definitely a top DIPA, but I'm just not convinced it is the best. The ABV is well hidden and is a creeper, though I'd love to have another and continue the research."

"O: I really enjoyed my first experience with Heady Topper -- it is an exceptional beer and I trust it was fresh since I was close to the source. It was worth the trouble to track it down, and I found it in an off-the-beaten-path place in Burlington. Check it out for sure."

In fact, all things said and done I have had several that could give heady a run for its money. But! An amazing beer. Must get more."

The only reason I give it a 4.5 is because there is something that I taste in Pliny, Fat heads Hop JuJu and Three Floyds Permanent Funeral that just amazes me.  I believe its the fruity aroma matched with the spectrum of flavors that hit me from those beers over Heady.  Can't go wrong with heady though, its outstanding."

Tons of fruit on the tongue and the finish was silky smooth.For a DIPA this is very drinkable. Can't wait to get some more."

"The hype is real. Tried my first heady last weekend. There is not much I can say that has not already been said. So, I will say that you have not tried an IPA until you drink one of these bad boys.

"This beer has a truly one of a kind taste and smell. A bright hazy gold, with a fluffy head. It's by far one of the most unique beers in Vermont, and anyone who's from here knows, that's a lot to compete with. Absolutely the greatest IPA out there. We're all hoping for """The Crusher", """Focal Banger", """Holy Cow IPA""" to start bigger production. Keep it up Alchemist."

"I thought maybe the hype was too much for this beer, but god damn! This is amazing! The appearance is a dark golden hue with a nice head that lasts and then trails down the glass. The smell is full of citrus and baked bread. The taste is crazy complex with different sensations of hops coming through all through out the taste. Love this one, maybe a new favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: very very good.. Is it better than other amazing DIPAs that I've had? Maybe? Either way it is damn good and I am stoked to get some more and try it out of a glass to see if it changes anything for me.. Thanks again for the hookup Nat!"

"I was able to get a can of the Heady Topper through a new acquaintance out of J'Town, PA. I traded Two Bros Night Cat and Side Kick for it. The beer poured a hazy straw color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly sweet malt....and I was hoping for more pine and citrus. The taste was a good balance between sweeter malt and bitter hops there is presence of some pine and a touch of apricot like citrus all bolstered by an oily resiny base. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but not the best IPA I've had (IMO). It's great...don't get me wrong...but the original Zombie Dust before is was massed produced was better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard-to-find, but when I did I drink it straight from the can. Overall a good IPA but not the best I've ever had. I busted two cans in my luggage flying back from Vermont. So please protect it better than I did. Hoppy yes, but not too hoppy. Good balance."
"Received as an extra in a trade with malfunxion. First time trying this - and as advised from The Alchemist, I drank it straight from the can. The artwork on the can draws you in to that first sip. Taste is a perfect blend of hops with very little bitterness; delicious. Well done, but best beer in the world? No way."
""
""
"So I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it packs a deceiving kick. Though I do think this is a great beer for hop heads and I do enjoy massive doses of that piny spicy flower I am not sure I could give this a 100. Great yes but a 100 no. The best beer not to me."
""
""
""
""
""

"Not sure why there so much hype behind this beer. I loved the old Alchemist pub in Waterbury and miss it a lot. Alchemist makes a few great beers but Heady Topper isn't their best offering. Living near the brewery makes you hate it however. Tourist obsess over it and it's become an annoying attraction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden in color, and hazy (as is my memory after a few). The taste is amazingly well balanced between the sweetness and bitterness. It is a mighty brew, full of complex flavors that I can't begin to describe accurately. Needless to say it is relentlessly drinkable, but will put you right to sleep if you are not careful. Goodness gracious, it truly lived up to the hype."
""
"This beer is all hype. Most of the people that love this beer don't live in VT. This is not even they best IPA or DIPA in VT."
""
""
""
""
"The fruitiness in this beer is what makes it most impressive. It's not excessively grapefruit heavy while still offering citrus and it's not overly piney either. It's deceivingly easy-to-drink and that would mean trouble if I had access to more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I’m not going to gush over the best beer known to civilized man. I believe there is a lot of hype surrounding this beer. Admittedly, it’s a great example of a DIPA. One of the best I’ve had or known about so far. It’s very drinkable and very enjoyable. Thank you again Jet and Danica for allowing me to experience this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But let's be real, Pliney is still the king. This is a great beer, but Pliney is still in a league of its own. The hype of some competitors is real, but the champ is still the champ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In the past 2-3 years of my trading years I've had probably a case worth of Heady. I'm happy that I've got friends in high (latitude) places that can keep sending me a 4-pack or two every drop. It's definitely worth the chase folks."

"Overall, I think Heady Topper deserves to top the 250. Is it the best beer I've ever had? I don't think so. But it didn't disappoint me one bit."
"Had to pour out a little from the can despite the warning just to see the color. Carmel/amber in color. The nose is so fresh, full of citrus fruits and piney hops! No surprise here, that's pretty much the taste on the palate also. Quite a hop punch to this DIPA, excellent balance and acidity, alcohol masked well. Unbelievably drinkable and just so damn fresh. It's like I'm chewing on a hop cone. They say it's the water that makes this special but whatever it is, keep doing it. I hope they begin to distribute because getting a can of this in NYC was hard. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head. It's a tough call, but I think this might top the all mighty Pliney!"

"Finally got my hands on a can after all this time. Poured into my SN Liettich Balloon glass despite the """DRINK FROM THE CAN""" text on the can. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. This is exactly what a DIPA should look like. Smell is of citrus and mango. The Simcoe really comes through in the smell. Taste follows the nose. Just in-your-face juicy hops. Fruity, cirtusy, a little pine. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, which makes for a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. Mouthfeel is great. I always say with a juicy IPA you need a fuller mouthfeel and this is exactly what I mean. Overall, a great DIPA, one of the best. Would I go way out of my way to get it again? Probably not but it's something everyone needs to try at least once."

"O: Living in VT and being able to get this all the time (at least Thursday afternoons) where I live I may be biased, but Heady Topper is one of the best DIPA's I've had. At 8% ABV it's biting but not overwhelming (I do like a high ABV stout or barleywine) and keeps it crisp with the aroma hops addition(s). Delicious and perfect for a VT summer BBQ."

""
""
"Overall: well, there was no way this could live up to the hype. It was really solid, but it wasn't the best IPA I've ever had; nor was any of its characteristics (smell, etc) best. Still, glad to have gotten the chance to try it."
""
""

""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really really like this DIPA I can't explain why but I do. I'm willing to make a pilgrimage at some point, also to checkout fine beers like Lawson's, and Hill Farmstead both of which I've never consumed. Not earth shattering but so unique there's just no other canned/bottled/draft DIPAs with these traits they built they're brewery around this recipe and I can see why. No let's see more innovation and how about some distribution outside of Vermont."
""
""

""
""

"Overall - Well, The #1 dipa has been conquered. I'm surprised at how smooth, and easy drinking this is. This reminded me of a more smooth, balanced and less alcohol version of hopslam. IMO, which honestly means nothing to anyone else other then me, this is not the best dipa ive ever had. I can think of 2 or 3 locals ive had that I enjoy more. And a few other ipa's ive had that I liked more. I did enjoy It moreso then the other highly ranked, hyped dipa pliny but there's no way id travel a long distance to buy it or I wouldnt trade for it again but,,,,if it was available at local shop id pick it up for sure in when I want a change up from my favorites. I did enjoy this more from glass, as I always do for any canned beers."

"Finally got to try the #1 beer so thought I would write a review! Appearance is great, unfiltered and good yello/gold color. Smell is amazing with great hops coming through. Taste is where I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong it's good but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Can't tell but missing something. And mouthful was just alright. Overall a good beer but feel like I've had better IPAs out there."

"1 4pk remaining then I will hold back for 4 or 5 months before getting my next haul"
""

"Overall: What's not to like about this robust double IPA? This is what a DIPA should taste like. So full of hoppy goodness, I can barely stand it. Deceivingly drinkable despite the 8% abv. Scary good!"
"O: A superb beer that deserves it's high demand, and one that I'll be jealous of not being able to get easily once my allotment is gone. #1? Eh, maybe... I prefer Pliny, but that's just my personal taste, and I would never, ever turn down the opportunity to get more Heady in my fridge."
"Very glad to see Heady on top right now. The Alchemist had the best brewery tap room in perhaps the United States - pint of kombucha! - until the flood a few years ago went up halfway their window."

"I won't make this a complicated review. I will tell you that his beer lived up to the hype for me. We all have different palates so I'm not going to try and tell you what I smell and taste other than the fact that this beer, to my palate was ridiculously smooth, incredibly drinkable, and had a great finish. Continue your mission to find it. You won't be disappointed."

"It's quite the reputation to live up to, being ht. My first experience tangling with this legend was a very positive experience, it's certainly up their with Pliny, and I would love to do a h2h. It's a very nuanced and flavour forward profile, lighter and more floral than I might have expected, it nonetheless delivers what could easily be called a flawless execution. As a dipa goes, this would have to be near perfection, as far as across all styles... That's a matter of opinion. All I can saw is I feel privileged to have gotten to try this beer, especially the lengths taken to get this can... And it doesn't fall short of giving a really excellent experience"
"This is a great huge balanced IPA. Does not have the drinkaablity of Pliny but if you are loking for a wham in your face IPA with some malt backbone this is the best. Huge citrus and pine flavors very overhemling. medium to medium high mouthfeel. Not a hot weather IPA, would go great and standup with very spicy foods. Love the can and artwork."

"A friend was kind enough to bring me a 4 pack, and despite being around three months old, the beer is still delicious."

""
""
""
""
""
"Lives up to the hype. Had it in can as instructed. Also worth trying in an IPA glass if you have enough of them to experiment. High alcohol content without losing its smoothness is one of its many impressive traits. Listen to the advice to drink asap. I had one several months old and the decline was noticeable. Enjoy."

"O- lives up to the hype i drove from southern MA to stowe VT for a small chance to find what is a beer milestone in my books and well worth the trip it is as good if not better than i anticipated scarily drinkable and very refreshing you can taste the attention to detail and appreciate the desire to keep the brewery closed the public to perfect their craft deserving of the hype"
""
"so I have to pour it into a glass to see its appearance... right? first drink is out of the can, as recommended, and very nice. first drink is also just after the Pliny, for comparison purposes... hazy and unfiltered, my brain is saying """hefe!""" dark, hazy yellow, some head from a soft pour. fragrant. some lemon. as someone else said, """rich, creamy citrus nose...""" perfect description. and I liked this description also: """silkier and thicker unfiltered mouthfeel...""" this is very good; I can see why it is compared to Pliny. both are very legendary brews.... I cant say one is better, it always fits your mood at the time, right? a little sweet, a little biscuit, very very beautiful... i'm happy to have tried this. I wonder how it tastes fresh?"

"overall: Extraordinary. I went back to poring in a glass. The can just didn't open the flavors like the glass pour. Maybe i'm not doing it right. Also notice the hop intensity dulls the mouth a bit. I'm not tasting as much as I drink more. In any case...wow."

"O: Heady Topper is the real deal. I can honestly say it is the best beer I have ever had. I'm always a little sad when I'm finishing my last can because I know it'll be a while before I'll be able to get another. I just wish the Alchemist would start distributing in Boston..."

"O: Incredibly well balanced IPA... Medley of sweet, citrus and bitter flavors play perfectly off of one another. One I will continue to snag without question when the right opportunity presents itself. Wish I could make this my """regular heady""" Disc Golf beer."
"It says drink from the can but I poured it anyway for appearence reasons. Very west coast style, up there with the best of IPA's I have had. Wonderfully juicy and very refreshing, if it weren't 8% I could easily drink a sixer of it. Only had once since I am living in PA but will search out again"
""
"I am not, I repeat NOT, a hop head. This was the beer that changed my opinion of IPA's. So I guess it's fair to say I wasn't a hop head. The aroma is what first got me. Like a bowl of freshly cut tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is down right dairy-like. Creamy and not too thin. There is a perfect balance of bitterness and malty undertones. I live 5 hours (10 round trip) from the nearest retailer and I regularly make the trip to obtain HT. If you get the chance, don't pass it up."

"This is a truely wonderful beer. I would easily put it up there with the top 5 I have ever had the pleasure of trying."

""
""
""

"Heady topper is an ipa perfected. The hop profile imparts a perfect flavor without being overly bitter. The alchemist does a phenomenal job crating a perfect ipa for us hop heads that love the flavor of hops but may not care for the bitterness all the time."

"Wish it was available in NJ."
""
"The one definitely lived up to the hype. Tried it on a """can-share""" with some friends. Nose was incredible, despite my initial distaste for IPA's. This helped me cross over to the hop side because the taste was not overwhelmingly bitter, but rather pleasant with pine and citrus flavors. A beer I hope to have another opportunity to sip on soon!"

I can't help but feel like I'm pouring an IPA through a bouquet of fresh hops directly into my mouth. Hands down a beer to get your hands on if you happen to come by it."

""
""
"O - I admit I went to try this beer on reputation. It really is as great as advertised. Of course everyone has their own tastes. Enjpy!"
"Overall, this is one of the most well-balanced and complex IPAs I have ever had. I can totally understand why this is the highest rated beer on the site. The flavor is nearly perfect, and as long as you don't mind haze or drinking out of the can there is very little that you could find at fault about his beer. Every phase of the brewing process contributes to the flavor of the beer. Hops, malt, peachy esters from the 'Conan' yeast, as well as numerous intricacies I am sure only the brewing staff is aware of (ie water profile). This is a real ale, so many brewers seem to be taking the IPA away from the malt and yeast character and this one embraces them and finds balance with them. This beer is a true beer."
"Most already know the flavor specs so just thought Id share my experience and say the locals I spoke with rate this just behind Double Sunshine for the States best Double IPA...if only that wasn't an even more rare """whale.""" But whatever I'm just thrilled to have now had HT in my life."

"Pouring it reveals a normal yellow beer, nothing spectacular about the color, but the aroma that comes out of the can immediately after opening it is crazy. It releases a very strong aroma of pine and hops. Taste is very bitter, very piney, but refreshing and thin. You could drink a few of these and just think of how amazing this beer is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: OK, the comparison must be made…I love this beer, but Pliny is better. And I may be a West Coast snob, but there are a few other West Coast IPAs that I would prefer to this. For lack of a better term this is not as “bright” a beer as some others in the category. It is certainly more balanced, but that is not always what I’m looking for in a Double IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Glad I got to try this one once just to say I did. However I don't think it's worth the trouble that people go to to get it. While it is a great DIPA it's up to each person to decide whether its worth the hype"
""
""
""
"Overall my blind guess was that this was Rapture but I was wrong.  In my humble opinion I put Heady over Rapture but way behind The Crusher and Focal Banger.  I think Heady needs to get it's act together. It is no longer the #1 beer in BA."

"I finally found a hookup that could get me these on a regular basis. Man, it was worth the effort. The Alchemist seriously nailed it. This beer is damn near the perfect IPA. For this big of an IPA the bitterness, or lack thereof is notable. The hops just keep coming. I read that there was some oatmeal added for mouthfeel. I get it. Perfect. Seriously, it's oneof the best IPA's I've ever had."
""
"O: they werent trying to make the hoppiest DIPA out there, but they did. This is a beast. Intense in aroma, taste and a creamy thick mouthfeel. But it remains very drinkable. A 4 pack would be too filling but whose drinking a 4 pack of this. Sip, savor, enjoy. Excellent excellent beer. So far, one of a kind and deserves the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel a little ridiculous to be giving it a perfect 5, but there's really nothing I would change about this beer, and it embodies everything I love about IPAs. It definitely lives up to the hype, although I do have to admit I was disappointed on my first sip because I expected it to be God. And then I took another couple sips and all my disappointment faded away. I should mention that this was pretty fresh - cans purchased on 4/25/14, so I imagine they were brewed pretty soon before that, but unfortunately, there's no date."

"Big, fresh hop aromas right out of the can - tons of pine and some nice citrus. Flavor is quite bitter, yet beautifully balanced, managing to be easy drinking while still full-bodied and packing a huge hoppy punch. Great mouthfeel, nicely complex, very tasty. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Can't wait to drink it again"
""
"O- A beer that my wife and I enjoyed on our second anniversary. It is a serious IPA that brings it with the hops, but remains so balanced. I would still prefer PtE and a handful of other IPAs over this one, but I can see why this one gets so much love."

"Equal to La Cumbre Elevated IPA and Pliny the Elder for my taste buds. I just wish I could try all three at the same sitting."
""
""
""
"Overall, having one of these fresh as opposed to a few months old is a game changer. I wrote my previous experiences off as a beer with too much hype. But being able to enjoy fresh examples has made me into a believer."
""
""
"O: A beer that suffers from its own success. Make no mistake, Heady is a fantastic beer, one of the best I have ever had, but the hype machine is far too powerful. I would put it in the same category as Double Sunshine, Hopslam, Double Daisy Cutter, and Dreadnaught, with no clear winner...and I dont consider that a slight. That is heavy company."

"O-Some reviews may be skewed because the hype behind this beer. It has a lot to live up to before you even try it. That may seem unfair but this beer surpassed my expectations. This is the Michael Jordan of beers circa 89-97 It is going to score 30 a night on you and not give a shit if you planned on stopping it. Is it the best beer in the world? I have no clue I haven't tried every beer yet. I do know its the best beer I have ever had, and I've had a lot of them. John is a Hop Whisperer and I will drink his beers anytime I get a chance to."

"Having said that, this is one of the best IPAs that I have ever had. But it is in all honesty, just a good version of Budweiser. A very good version. Point being that I don't understand all the fuss. I could name 20 beers that I'd rather have than drink this ever again. It's honestly not all that special unless you prefer IPAs above all else.."
""
""
""
"Although residing in the west coast, I've had the pleasure of trying this beer multiple times due to awesome friends. The first time I had this beer it was split three-ways, poured into glasses. At that time i felt that this beer was overhyped and couldn't stand up to the likes of PtE. However upon having a can to myself, straight from the can, I can definitely see why HT is so highly regarded."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Lucky enough to find a local shop that gets it shipped by a Vermont local. This beer is amazing a few weeks old, I can only imagine how good it tastes fresh! Even though it says to enjoy out of the can I prefer it poured into a glass. Helps me capture the amazing aroma."
""
""
"Drink it from the can !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say about this beer, it is everything people say it is and the hype is spot on. Although, the level if IBU's have been consistent at times I can have one where the hoppiness really comes through while other times it is more gradual and the notes are released with perfection. I know that the brewery has other brews that it releases in limited quantities, but I hope they can try and produce the other options with a bit more releases then they currently offer. But no complaints they are staying true to their brew and """Heady Topper""" is always on my list of brews that I would have on any given day."
""
"Nauseatingly good."
""
""
"I drank Heady Topper a couple times from cans only, never on tap. I thought it was a great beer but not the best in the world. If I went out to a pub and they had HT , I would order and drink it over probably others because it's so hard to get anywhere outside Vermont."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a more complex IPA which I liked about it. There is a bigger malt presence and therefore not as bitter as some out there. I liked it better out of the can, which actually balanced the beer out. The beer pours like a hefeweizen. It's a great beer, but I don't know that I'd want it over some of the local options I have."

""
""

"Drank this right from the can as I was instructed. The nose smells like beer candy and the beer is creamy and hoppily delicious. This beer just does everything right, and honestly gets better with every sip. While it's not my favorite IPA I've ever had (Double Citra from Hill Farmstead currently wears that crown), this is absolutely wonderful and I would drink this every night if I could."

"It's quickly becoming an addiction, and not the right addiction to have for those of us living on the opposite side of the country. Damn you, Alchemist."

""
"Just wish I had another can!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm drinking my 3rd ever Heady Topper as I type this and all I can think of is how honored this beer makes me feel. The Alchemist Heady Topper was only meant to be drank by a chosen few. Because, by Odin's beard, this is the mead of gods!!!"
""
""

"I love this freakin beer. Unlike some of the heavier/boozier top beers, this not only goes hand in hand with Pliny for best in class, but is a daily drinking beer too. Just wish it was more readily available so I could have it daily. If you ain't had it, get you some."
""
"Am very lucky to have a steady supply due to my proximity to Waterbury. Due to that I am always looking forward to cracking the next heady that brings that delicious hoppy not to citrusy ipa smell to your nostrils. The taste is the most memorable i've ever had with the perfect bite to accompany it's 8% abv, making it impossible to not savor the last taste. Believe the hype."
""
""
"O. Excellent beer, almost lives up to the hype, lol a must have for any IPA lover big thanks to HBJ for procuring it!"
""
""
""
""
"Worth the drive to Vermont to get it!"
"A fantastic Double IPA. It does however have a very sweet after taste. The reason this beer is rated so well is the genius marketing from the Alchemist Team. Cheers to you for that John! I am drinking this beer out of a glass right now, and I do have to say that they are deadly serious about it being better in the Can."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, one of the best IPAs out there!"
""
""
""
"O- An awesome beer. Probably my favorite IPA now, It's between this and sucks. This beer has a great balance between hops and malt. The hops are great and everything from top to bottom is great in this beer. I honestly think though that the beer is better in the can than the glass, you get a much higher concentration on flavor and aroma."

""
""

"O: So far the best I have ever had, maybe stupid but this beer has been life altering, I have been searching for HT's equal for 3+ yrs. A couple times I have thought to myself """wow this is kinda like heady!""" but a few sips later and they all become too bitter or too sweet/syrupy. I have been lucky enough to do a side by side camparo of heady and Pliny but it was not even close and I had to assume that something was wrong with the Pliny, maybe it was old? Anyway, hope to try it again some day."

"Typical Double IPA. Had a great crisp citrus taste to it. It was not as smooth as I thought it was going to be. Notice the hops more on the after tastes. cloudy appearance. In my opinion not worth all the hype. I can easily say there are so many better IPA's out on the market."
""
""
""
""
"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Best beer in the Country? That depends on the drinker. It is easily one of the best beers I have ever had in my life and I smile just thinking about it. Pliny, Lawsons, Hill Farmstead, New England Brewing Co... I've had them all many times and they are all so damned good! I find no point in saying one is """better""" than the other.. This beer leaves you feeling like you just ate a fresh grapefruit. It leaves you wanting to crack another. I've had it out the can and out of a Tulip, and its just as good either way! GOD BLESS THE ALCHEMIST!"

""
"I do not like to """believe the hype""" but Heady Topper did not disappoint. Did not drink out of the can. The color when poured in a glass is beautiful. The smell is very unique and the flavor holds true. One of my most important factors in tasting beers is the after taste. Heady just keeps going and going. Fantastic beer."

"UPDATE 4/7/15: Saved two cans until I could go up again to buy more but it's turned out to be almost a year so far.  Good test of the theory that IPAs go bad quick.  The old Heady I am having now from mid-April 1914 poured mostly foam over hazy orange, receded to thin surface foam and patterned lacing.  Not as hoppy but with loads more grassy notes and added floral notes as well, making this still very enjoyable!    The quality still shines.  Raising my ratings A: 3.75 to 4.25."

"Thanks has to go to nedvalton, a most generous BA'er for hooking me up with my first Heady Topper. As soon as I popped the top on that shiny silver and black can I got blasted with the dankest, hoppiest, fruitiest, hop bombiest goodness I have ever experienced. There's just so much going on with the smell, that I am having a hard time nailing it down. Here goes nothing, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, Bubblegum surf wax, I swear I'm getting that. This stuff smells exactly like I imagined it would after reading so many of the reviews on here, an absolute delight. I poured about half into a tulip glass so that I could get a good look at it. Pours a super hazy and resinous golden orange hue, minimal head and lacing. It smelled amazing in the can, but the complex aroma really opened up once poured, now I'm even more intrigued. My first sip and all I can say is, YES! Worth all the hype, 100 percent! I've had a few other beers that come real close to this, but the mouthfeel and balance along with the juicy aftertaste make this an absolute work of art in a can! With each sip it gets better and better, the bitterness isn't overwhelming at all, and couple that with the citrusy/fruity/floral undertones that coat your tongue, it's easy to forget that theres alcohol in there. Just like it says on the can """so drinkable, it's scary""" Overall I can see why this beer is ranked #1, because it just became my #1 as well. Thank you nedvalton, and thank you Alchemist!"

"Good head but quick dissipation, mild lacing. Cloudy and golden in appearance. Nose is mild-moderate in strength, fruity with no hint of dank-type hop aromas. Taste is very smooth, silky mouthfeel, with moderate-strong but not overwhelming hop profile. It's all peach and grapefruit with no dank character at all, more intense and complex as the beer warms. Only a mild suggestion of the heat in the finish. This is a great beer but perhaps not as world-class a beer as Pliny, in my humble opinion."
"Overall, Heady Topper was a great beer and happy as hell I tried it. It won’t go down in my personal Top 10 DIPA. It’s not even an issue of hype because I don’t pay attention to that shit anymore. And excellent beer, tasty as hell and worthy of the praise."

"Heady Topper is by far one of my favorite beers ever sampled. I've had it probably over 20 times, very hard to get, but they always happen to show up at our beer tastings. I'm not a huge fan of the amount of yeast/sediment in the bottom, but if you pour it just right into a pint glass you can avoid most of the sludge. Very hoppy and very flavorful."

"O-Delicious. If I could get this regularly, I would be buying everything I could! Don’t fear the hype. It is all true."

"This is easily the best DIPA or IPA that has ever come across my palette. Not being a fan of particularly hoppy beer, I was hesitant that this would be too much for me. I'm pleased that I gave it the chance it deserved. I've now opened up to these complex and floral offerings. Heady Topper is the gold standard. The pure evergreen-ness of this beer perfectly conveys the woods where it is brewed. Well done Alchemist."
"O- I've had plenty of big hype beers that didn't deliver. Heady delivers. In spades."

"My first post on BA. While a seasoned IPA drinker, this beer is simply the best. I have recently had FRESH GROWLERS OF firestone union jack, sierra nevvada torpedo, nugget necctar, Hop Stupid, Hop Nosh, etc... it had been 2 months since my last heady topper. Very Lucky to have a friend pick me up 12 of these unreal IPA's . while I like hoppy beers I like balanced IPA's not overly bitter. . This beer is perfect. Drinkability is unreal for an 8% IPA. Flavor is fruity but not overly so, hoppy, but not overly so, simply the best. No contest."

"Easily the best beer I have had the good fortune to taste, so it is appropriate that it be my first review on BA. Living in NH, my close proximity has allowed me to enjoy it fairly regularly. A wonderful smelling beer that when fresh can literally fill a room with a floral citrus hop aroma. It pours with a nice head, and has a typical cloudy appearance in the glass for the style. The alcohol is well masked. This beer has a nice balance of heavy citrus hops and bitterness. My only wish is that the alchohol content were a little less so I could enjoy more than one in an evening. However, it is the kind of beer you can drink slowly and savor each sip. If you have not had it, make a trade to get it, as it deserves the #1 rating it currently holds."
""
"If you are a person who likes hops this is a beer for you. This beer is a nicely brewed DIPA which explodes your palate. a well balanced floral/fruit aroma and hoppiness flavor and a citrus bite to it. overall this was a great beer. if you can get your hands on this beer you'll be in heaven."
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding. This beer was a about a month and a half old, but was still extremely hoppy and fragrant. I can only imagine how much better it would have been if it were fresher. Nevertheless, this was a great beer. Kudos Alchemist Brewery, ku-fucking-dos."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Heady topper has all that a hop lover would appreciate and more. The unfiltered, strong flavor of the hops overpowers the flavor of the alcohol. This beer recommends that you drink it from the can to allow unfiltered parts at the bottom to remain. The most flavorful and delicious beer of this type that I have had."
""
""
""
""
"Top beer. Although it says drink from the can, I enjoy it from a glass much better. Full grapefruit smell. High hop taste. Mouthfeel is OK. Little to no bitter aftertaste. Ages ok, but best fresh. Got mine from the brewery before they closed the retail shop."
""
""
""
""
""
"F- Outstanding IPA, while unbelievably hard to get fresh, very much worth all the hype."
""
""
"I'm honestly not sure what all the hype is about. I think the fact that it's hard to get and really hoppy makes it a winner in most people's books. For me though it had a weird background taste every sip that I wasn't really used to I guess. After about the 3rd or 4th can though I started to like the beer a lot more."
"Recycle the can and repeat!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Many people say that THEIR regional IPA is """better than Heady", I've heard it said about Hopslam, Gandhi-bot, Zombie Dust, Pliny the Elder, Jai Alai, etc. But when put head to head (no pun intended) it is (A.) Heady Topper that it is being compared to and (B.) the Heady Topper that comes out on top (given the taster is unbiased)."

"Finally had a chance to get my hands on a can of HT. Poured into a glass, even though it says to drink from the can. The aroma of this beer is fantastic. Very floral and pleasant. First sip was no different. It's a very unique Imperial IPA. Not over bearing with the hops but you know they're there. Very smooth and easy to drink, which is dangerous for an Imperial IPA. I wish this stuff wasn't so hard to get because I'd have a fridge full of it right now. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had."

"This is one of the few times that a beer has met the hype."

"As close to a perfect beer as you can get. It lives up to the hype. You can drink it ice cold, even warm and it will still tastes great. The first thing I noticed was the excellent aroma. This is a really hoppy beer but not bitter at all. My favorite beer to date."
"This Stuff is the real deal, believe the hype cause this stuff is awesome. So many complex flavors that roll through the entire palete from start to finish. This is one of my favorite beers right now with lawsons double sunshine right there. If you can get your hands on some you are a lucky person."

"Hop-forward, but not aggressively so. Just a fun beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
"This is really a fantastic beer. It's by no means a hop-bomb, but has a very generous bill that's equally balanced by it's fantastic malt character. Since I can now say that I am lucky enough to have had both Pliny and Heady, I can say that they are similar but different. With Pliny, I get more pine and less grapefruit off of the head. The malt takes more of a secondary role and I get less resin from the hops throughout. With Heady, the malt is sweeter, and makes its presence known throughout as it dances with the bitterness. It's impossible to chose between the two, but they are obviously in a category of their own. Heady is a very well-balanced IPA with as much flavor-per-sip as you're going to get in the IPA category. Definitely lives up to the hype."

Usually with these really big double IPAs, my pallette gets overwhelmed about halfway through (I'm looking at you, Palate Wrecker), and I no longer really taste as much as I did at first. I did not have this sensation with Heady Topper. Its a very well balanced, complex, and huge, double IPA."

"16oz. can! This one pours a cloudy darker golden color. There a few floaties in there. Small white head that doesn’t linger long but does leave some lacing. Big nose of hops, hops and more hops! Grapefruit is the main contributor. Maybe some pineapple, peach and orange in there too. Nothing else making past the hops. The taste is good. Not nearly as bitter as you think it might be. Nice rounded flavor, fairly bitter, but there is a touch of sweetness hiding in there. Grapefruit and pine hops, with a strong malt body behind it. I’d say it definitely lives up to the hype. Now to get some more..."

"Finally had the chance to try one while skiing at Sugarbush and I must say, it is worth the hype. That first sip speaks for itself. Hints of citrus with a smooth body that is not too overwhelmingly hoppy. The beer is surprisingly refreshing while retaining a nice hoppy taste and a strong full flavour. The perfect beer to have after skiing and I was very content having only one. The next day i had another one and the quality was equally impressive. A great beer to drink slowly and enjoy as each sip reveals a unique taste. Easily the best double IPA i have tried and one of the only beers where i can honestly say that less is more. Saviour it while you drink it and you will totally be impressed!"

"Overall: Is this the best beer in the world? I don't know, I haven't tried them all. For me it surely lives up to the hype. For me personally, it is perfect. Has everything I'm looking for in an IPA. It is worth going after. I wouldn't go to crazy as it is just beer, but damn it is good. I will continue to trade for this when I can."

Big grapefruit aroma.I miss going to the brewery and smelling all the hops. Smells so fresh. A ton of hops on the flavor. All the stuff in the aroma comes through and coats the tongue with a wave of pine and citrus. So resonious. Nice carbonation, as well. Mouthfeel is where this beer shines. Such a great beer and absolutely worth seeking out."

If you love hops jump right in and take a bath. great complexity pineapple up front, citrus galore, piney and juicy all they way through. every sip makes you think of something different, there is so much going on with this beer its impossible to capture in words or in one sip, so grab a few cases."
"Keep this refrigerated. Treat it like a perishable product. Take a road trip to VT with friends and ravenously track this down. Just took my last sip of the can, and it's still a bitter, sweet, hoppy, resiny, beast of a brew. Is it my favorite beer I've ever had? I'm not entirely sure, but I can safely say this deserves BA's #1 spot on the rankings."

"O- Overall, I can see why there is so much hype with this beer although I think a huge part of it is that it's only distributed in just a couple of towns in the state of Vermont. I will say it's one of the best DIPAs I have tasted, although fresh from the tap Enjoy By is right up there too. My buddy got me a four pack of this for my birthday and I am very grateful. It's a great beer to drink on a summer night and the 16 oz. serving just enough. A little more than your typical 12 oz. home serving, but much easier to finish than a 22 oz. bomber. I don't know about the hype, but I would say the ratings are pretty accurate. This is a legendary brew to say the least!"

"I was concerned that this would under deliver. Gladly it truly lives up to the hype. Beautiful pour. I split this pour into a sampling glass from the Garden State BrewFest and straight from the can, as suggested. Loved it all the way through. This improved with every sip. The last sip was the best as all the goodness remaining at the bottom of the can and mixes with each tip of the can."
"O- The best beer I have ever had. Lives up to the hype. Its IPA perfection for me. If there was anything negative or constructive critisism I could offer is that this may not be an every day beer for some because it is someone heavy, calorie dense, and comes in 16 ounce cans. 2 of these may make you feel full and bloated. Besides, this shouldnt be looked at as an every day beer. It's a spectacular beer made to be slowly sipped and enjoyed once or twice a week max, IMHO. Cheers."

""
"I've been lucky enough to grab a can of Heady Topper through a friend who did a trade for it, otherwise I wouldn't have had the sheer pleasure of tasting this beauty. Living near the """Hop Highway", I'm used to good IPAs near me. Put this one up there with Pliny and Enjoy By, which are the best IPAs that I can easily get."
""
""
""
"I've tasted a fair amount of beer to this point in my life. This beer is by far the best beer I've had the privilege to enjoy. It has a very hoppy aroma, so strong in fact you can smell it in your car with the windows rolled up as you're arriving to the brewery in Waterbury, VT. It has a fantastic hoppy flavor as well."
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. Hops to the max. They must have a huge late addition of hops in this beer. Seems like definitely some Simcoe and Amarillo in here. This is how I like my IPAs, dank, slightly sweet, fruity and mellow long bitterness. A benchmark beer for sure. Congrats to The Alchemist for having the balls to make such a huge hop aroma and flavored beer."
""
"Overall, this is classic. Full of fresh hop character and a masterpiece among many brewed in the same style. Doesn't break ground in any new way but just shows what something masterfully brewed tastes like. Deserves to be in the same sentence as that which contains other world class double IPA's, but to me falls short to the likes of Kern Rivers Citra, Lawson's Double Sunshine, and the stellar Alpine Bad Boy."
""
"I was luck enough to land six in a trade recently and enjoyed 3 of them. One in the can, one in a glass, and one where I poured a few ounces into a glass at a time. Overall, best IPA/IIPA I've ever had. I'm still having olfactory hallucinations about the massive tropical fruit, mainly pineapple, aromas this beer displays. I will be trading for moe of this soon. Well worth the effort and lives up to all the hype."

Rewards you with a great taste that warms as it settles to room temperature."

"A kind of ugly beer - I see why they suggest drinking it from the can. Pours a hazy orange with a little sediment and not much in the way of head action. The aroma is fruity - tropical, with some apricot and mango. The flavor follows suit, with mango, apricot, pineapple, and a bast of big sticky hops. The mouthfeel is big and round. This beer is at once unusual and familiar - it reminds me of the beer to which it is so often compared, Pliny the Elder, though it is bigger and fuller, both in its tropical fruit and rounder mouthfeel. It's clearly less dry than the Russian River beer. But curiously the West Coast beer to which it most closely compares, in my view, is Racer 5 from Bear Republic - they are different beers, but both are round, fruity and given to showing up with a thick orange haze. It is as if Racer 5 and Pliny crashed into one another and spawned some crazy new hybrid. Heady Topper is a very good beer, but I wonder whether the frenzy would be as great if it were produced in greater quantity and distributed more widely."
"O: An incredible IPA. Not my favorite, but BA inflates their ratings, and they don't weight them how I personally would, so it might look that way. I don't know. I'd give it a 95."

Good luck on your hunt for this one, and enjoy!"

"This offering from The Alchemist is fantastic, the nose is super herbal and spicy aromatic from the hops. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel with a soft piney hop bite in the finish. Very balanced as stated on the can making this very enjoyable. One of the better IIPA's on the market."

"Pours out a nice orange in color in color with a small white head that dissipated quick. Smell is really fruity with orange, mango, and pineapple with a little a tiny bit of malt but it is so in the background that the hops are the forefront. Taste is really fruity with all that was in the nose but there is a tiny bit more bitter hops in the background that sits in the mouth and really meld well with all he other stuff going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for the style and really adds a lot to the beer. Overall this is an amazing beer that is hopped so well that it's a very hard beer to beat for the style. It is world class!!!"

"FINALLY!! Had the elusive Heady Topper!! Now at first, I wanted to come at this beer with an open mind. After all the hype and the talk about this beer, I cracked my first can. BAM! The aroma hits my nose. The floral, citrusy hoppyness enters my face holes. I take the first sip...let the beer move around my mouth. THIS BEER LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!!! Absolutely delicious from beginning to end. After my first few sips I sat there and just smelled it over and over to let that beautiful hoppyness permeate. great finish to the beer, tons of hops and floral tastes along with a sort of citrus/fruitiness. The hardest thing about this beer is keeping it in my fridge. Don't let anyone know you have this beer if you really want to savor it, because people will ask to drink one. And I'm not willing to share right now."

"My son brought us a bottle of fresh Pliney the Elder for Christmas. I've heard so much about the beer and it certainly lived up to the hype. Talk about fresh-it was bottled 10 days earlier!

"O: definitely worth seeking out if you like DIPA's. Very different from most others as well, the aroma is probably the best I have ever sensed but the taste, mouthfeel, and appearance bring it down for me a bit."
"O: I dont know how old my can was but I know it was at least 1 month. Ive had HT before and hadnt reviewed and the aroma was much more potent and amazing. The aroma seemed to be very subdued on this can. The mouthfeel and the development of flavors from first sip to the last is the reason to drink this. Sucks, Enjoy By, Pliny, Double Jack, etc. etc. have better appearance, aroma and first taste. There is something very unique about HT though. Its definitely in a class by itself."
"I will go back to Heady Topper in VT and age it for a year next time and see what happens."
""
""
"O: Was it worth the 4 hour drive? No. Will I ever seek out this beer again? No. Over hyped beer that is not worth your effort to obtain. It is not bad by any means, but it is not a top tier beer. Even Lawson's Double Sunshine IPA(sold in Vermont) is better than this beer. I prefer Surly Abrasive Ale and Stone Double Bastard Ale over this any day. Turns out even the piss taste of Corona Light is satisfying after a physical adventure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 100/100. You owe it to yourself to try and get your hands on a 4-pack of these cans! Well worth the drive to Vermont!"
"This beer balances sweet, bitter and citrus hop qualities like no other. Great beer, will buy it as long as I can find it! The one issue is that this beer is a bit thin for my preference but the creaminess that their conan yest puts out makes up for the final gravity."

"So many flavors. Drank out of a snifter poured fresh from the can. A variety of hops throughout although not too much (I am no """hophead"""). Delicious malt. Cannot recommend enough. Lives up to the hype if you can get your hands on a can. Glad I live in Vermont."
""
"Overall: Best beer in the world? Nah. But it's an amazing IPA and in my top 10 for sure."
"This is an absolutely incredible beer. I am a huge fan of Double IPAs, so I try them all and this is the best one I have had to date. It has such a refreshing taste and it packs a punch. I wish it wasn’t so hard to find, but I know that adds to the mystique. For all you beer fans out there, you will find it in Burlington along with many other good beers. I usually can argue top 250 ratings, but this one has the right top dog."

""

"What else can I say. Heady Topper has been one of the few beers out of all that I've tried that really lives up to the hype. A masterpiece by The Alchemist. Beer looks great and tastes great whether out of the can or poured. Appearance is copper, orange, unfiltered, cloudy, danky looking. Smell is spot on hoppy, piney, danky and citrusy. Taste is incredible with lots of pungent grapefruit in your face balanced by the piney bitterness and malt. Keeps you wishing you had a whole case. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated. It goes down so easy. This beer is #1 for a reason."

"Not being an ipa fan this beer is awesome. The hops are so well balanced. Highly revcommend dor the non ipa lover. I bought a 4 pk and can kick myself for not getting a case . Next visit I will get at least 1 case! A definite option for the non IPA oriented consumer."
"O- I think I'm understanding the hype. This was a really enjoyable beer. Only room for improvement would be on the appearance and the mouthfeel. But where it really counts, this beer delivers. And I have 7 more in the refrigerator. You lucky dog."
""
"O: Contrary to many DIPAs, Heady Topper is not so focused on hops, but has a real yeasty liveness, light on the malt side but very well balanced, not at all as bitter as expected from the IBU, but still very smooth and fruity. It evolves gracefully (probably at it peaks after one month, but it can be enjoyed even one year after canning, regarding my own experience, being really focused on the yeast quality). One of the best DIPAs I have been able to try, and one I really love revisiting on a regular basis."
" I like the idea of cans. When you get a fresh one it's very cloudy, naturally, because it's unfiltered. I don't really mind this but a lot of people do. The taste is great. Very hoppy, grapefruit and floral. I like the beer a lot and I want more, but it's not as crisp of a beer as Pliny. Heady is a bit more malty and slightly more bitter. Whenever you can find this beer drink it right away and do not save them or age them. It is best drank as fresh as possible."

"I must say this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Not only does it taste flawless but it looks and smells flawless as well. One of the most difficult beers to purchase on the market! Well worth the wait though. The smell alone if like no other, very fruity and strong, but not over powering."

"Definitely worthy of a 100 rating. Fresh hop beer consumed very soon after shipment arrived. Dank, grassy hops. Slight spice and earthy tones. Perfect carbonation and a sweet, faint malt character. Still trumped by Pliny and Enjoy By but among the top of its class. Oh, and I was a bad boy and didn't drink from the can. Hats off to the Alchemest all the way from Vermont doing the west coast ipa as good as or better than almost anyone out there."

"When it's fresh it's truly amazing. Liquid hop candy. Sweet but not cloying with with notes of resin, pine and grapefruit. Like drinking a liquid forest. As it ages it loses it's sweetness and grassy notes begin to dominate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the first crack of the can the piney hops aromas are enough to make you think you are amongst the pine covered hills of Vermont. The can does not lie - your first sip will be an explosion of hops. This beer is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a hop head beware... this DIPA could quite possibly ruin all others for you. :)"

"Let me preface this by saying, I'm not much of an IPA hop head. But a buddy scored this and I had to try it out of the can followed by in a glass. I actually like the glass offering better, but here goes: Poured from can into DFH snifter. Great looking light pale yellow beer with an inviting 2 fingers of head. Straw hues and a bit of cloudiness. Smell is awesome. Citrus hops meet earthy/pine hops. Getting grapefruit and apricot on the nose. Taste was pretty balanced and smooth for such a strong announced IBU. For not a big fan of the style, I was glad it went down as easy as it did. More pronounced fruit as it warmed. The can offering just seemed a bit less flavorful? to me than the glass. Feel was great with a medium heft and carbonation that was pleasant. Overall: The best IPA I have had, but again it's not my wheelhouse. I liked the citrus frontend and balance. I can see where those who love the style would really like this. I would drink again and think it's a must try."

"Without a doubt this is my favorite beer. Although the instructions on the can say to drink from the can I have on occaision used a glass, which is my prefferred beer drinking method. When you first open one you are hit with a wonderful smell that is not matched by any other beer I have ever experienced. The flavor of this awesom double IPA is very hoppy yet slightly fruity at the same time. There is something else unique about the tast but I cannot put it into words. I guess I find it robust and strong but smooth at the same time. The limited avaiablity undoubtedly adds to the mystic of this beer. I usually only get to have some about twice a year. Whenever I drink other IPAs I always mentally compare them to Heady Topper and they alwasy fall short, even if they are very good. For me nothing tops Heady Topper!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I suggest getting multiples to try one from the can, one in glass. Although most of everything you can say about this beer has been said, my take way is hugely balanced beer with great hops to malt balance, up front citrus fades to pine then to a roasty malt."
"I was wary to review this very hyped beer without careful consideration. I was lucky enough to have a case from a recent trip to Vermont to mull over the different aspects of this beer. Difficult to call any beer #1 in the world, but very appropriate to call it outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"My heady re-visit... Such a 'World Class' brew... Prolly the only one that I can say I'll ever go chase. Nothing about it disappoints. Even people that dislike IPA's not only enjoy this... They love it! It's such a great beer, I can't think of enough words to give it praise~"
""
"cheers"
""
""
""
"One of the great things about this brew is the price. The Alchemist could have taken the opportunity to charge through the nose for a beer with this reputation but it certainly is fair. I'm sure if I lived in the distribution area I'd come back to Heady Topper again since the price is very reasonable. That's despite the fact that it doesn't wow me like it does most people. Certainly worth a shot to see if it ever clicks with me."

"Very nice IPA. Fresh nose, with tons of citrus. The mouth feel has kind of a oil texture to it. This really is one of the best out there. I have been told that it is not as good if not fresh. I would actually like to try one a couple months old to taste the difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to get, only made in limited runs and available from local shops that limit 1 four pack per customer. So if you want to stock up be ready to travel around and visit several shops. Get there early, they sell out fast."
""
""
"I'll start by saying I am first and foremost a Belgian fan but wanted to try heady simply because it was number 1. Definitely one of the best IPAs I have ever had, beating out sculpin and stones enjoy by... The bitterness is non existent and you get swept by the grapefruit and pine flavors immediately. And even after settling a bit, the typical dry ipa bitterness never arrives. A must for every beer fan but with the understanding that there is a hype factor. Once again...I could think of many more Belgians I would prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I received an old can, would love to try again, but not gonna trade across the country for another one. No date, hard to determine freshness."
""
""
""
"What can I say? This beer is the reason I joined BA today. Turned on by a friend, i am eager to begin trading for this and other great beers. Heady Topper embodies everything I look for in an IPA. Seriously, this beer has it all. Great aroma, piney, tropical fruit flavored goodness. There is an excellent balance to this machine. Kudos to all at The Alchemist, you have earned my business if you can ever get down to Atlanta!"
"First time having this beer thanks to a trade. Soon as i took my first sip i got a blast of hops on the tongue. Hints of pine and grapefruit come through. This is simply one of the best if not the best DIPA out there. Zombie dust is a close second for me. cheers!"
"This beer deserves to be at the top of the charts. An incredible refreshing double IPA. As soon as you crack the can open you are delighted with a burst of great smell, taste and hops. Citrus smell and flavor comes through well. The fact it taste so good out of can gets a big thumbs up."
"This is a useless review, I'm no critic but I love heady topper. Got a case the last canning day at their current location. No refined palate here, but I appreciate great beer and I consider ht a leader of the pack. I love the can, I prefer drinking out of a can across the board, and I am no stranger to Budweiser or miller lite. To me all these beers have a place, but as far as double IPA's go, this is my favorite so far."
""
""
"This is a great beer! not a big crazy hop megabomb ( i REALY like hop megabomb) but its a very very good beer. Sooo easy to drink, you just want more more and more...Now i actualy think its a good thing that its hard to find and 4 hour drive from my place coz if i ad easy access to this beer ? it could become a problem lol"

"O - very nice almost perfection."
""
""
"Pours a murky, shiny orange color. Smells very citrusy and piney. The bitterness is extraordinary. Has a thickness to it that makes it unique but not strange. Easy drinking, making it hard not to just chug it after a long day. Lives up to the hype for sure, and would highly recommend it"
""
"An extraordinarily complex use of hop additions makes this one a world class experience. Believe the hype."
""
""
""

""
"But every time I crack one, I am reminded that God loves us and wants us to be happy, whether we're up to our assholes in alligators, or sitting on the back porch watching the dogs play. I may prefer Pliny, but I can't shake the feeling that Heady Topper is better. It's hard to admit your favorite ain't the best."
""
"Overall - This a wonderful beer that is deceivingly strong as you get no sense of any alcohol in it. The amazing aroma paired with the fantastic tropical and piney flavors makes any hophead rejoice. I normally pour every beer into a glass to consume butnI chose to follow the instructions on the can and I do think it makes for a more enjoyable drinking experience. I will try pouring the next one into a glass to compare. Regardless, this beer has set a new bar for all IPAs moving forward. Well done!"
"Massively tasty IPA. I can simultaneously understand the fanaticism surrounding it and am perplexed that people speak of it as a total mold-breaker. What it is is incredibly well-made. Perhaps I'm being harder on it because of the hype, but Heady hasn't ruined all other IPAs for me. That said, pretty psyched to have a case of it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Couldn't be more pleased with this beer. Definitely wish it was more readily available, but there is something cool about seeking it out and getting it on rare occasion. Like finding the holy grail. Is this better than Pliny? In my opinion, I remember enjoying Pliny a tad bit more, but would love to get a hold of each to do a side by side comparison."
"Served from the can approximately one week after the canning date. The beer was kept cold from the initial purchase. The smell when you first crack the can is one of the best smells I've experienced while enjoying beers. The perfect balance of hops hits your palate with perfect balance. When poured from the can, the color is slightly hazy and beautiful. Overall one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of having."

"Christmas Heady muled down from Vermont by my sister in law.  Broke rule number one and poured it into a glass.  Outstanding looking beer, not that clear watery look that many have, looks full and rich, orangish color, impressive head that stuck around and lacing was ideal.  I know I am supposed to drink it from the can but it is a great looking beer.  The smell is unreal, the citrus really jumps out at you.  The flavor follows and is also incredible, the juicy citrus jumps out at you, real smooth except for the bitter.  May be just a bit to much for me (not a hop head).  Plus, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue.  Rich, full texture with great carbonation, the perfect amount.  I did not notice any alcohol, it was an extremely easy to drink beer with the exception of the lingering bitterness.  Not the top for me but I completely understand why the hop heads love it."
""
""
"The tasting we had left me wanting more of this world class double IPA!"
""
"Wow. An outstanding beer. This really lived up to the hype (which is really saying something). I felt like I could truly taste the varietals of hops and it was magnificent. I am sold on this beer. One of the best I've had. My favorite part about this is that it says in the can to drink this straight from the can! This place is progressive and has fully embraced the superioriority of the can to the bottle."

"I FINALLY went to Vermont and I got the Heady Topper! I felt like a little kid once it was in my hands. This beer is the best thing since slice bread.. If you haven't had the Heady Topper find a way to get this beer in your hands...I went on Saturday October 26. They were sold out of the cans.. The lady who was handing out the samples told me on Monday they will have more for sale.. Once I walked in to the brewery on that Monday... Wowww!! You can smell the hops once you walk in.. The machines were cranking! Bottles we're being filled and my smile grew. I bought myself two 4 packs.. I'm happy with what I bought BUT something is telling me I'm going to have to drive from Boston back to VT - this time I'm grabbing a case."
""
""
"O - Found a reliable source in Vermont to pick these up for me and will be buying more when the time arises. Now that it's getting colder its time to stick to the world class stouts! This is the cream of the crop of DIPAs!"

"O- We've all heard the hype, was it the best beer I've ever had? No. But it is world class and one that I would seek out again. The biggest thing that sets this and Pliny apart from other DIPA's are their amazing drinkability. The hops are packed in, but they are not overbearing. I could drink a 4pack of this in one setting, which is nearly unheard of when it comes to this style"

One of the best beers I have ever tasted."

"The body was fairly typical for the style, but this is one of the driest finishing beers I've ever had. I'm almost thirsty after finishing each drink. Drinkability was dangerously good, I could see a 4-pack disappearing before you realize it. Overall, a very good brew, one that almost matches the hype that surrounds it (which is not the fault of either the beer or the brewery). Certainly a must try if given the chance.

""
"Theres nothing I can say about this beer that hundreds of people haven't said before. It's that damn good. I've paid $10 a can and I gotta say I'd pay $20. Looking forward to finally making a trip up to Waterbury next year. Pro tip: Makes a great wedding present. Tuck that knowledge away."
"I've never been so embarrassed for the beer community for rating this so highly. My fear is that the beer scene is being overrun by a bunch of hipsters who think that exclusivity is more important than the art of brewing. Heady Topper is hard to get. That doesn't make it the best beer in the world. People are rating this beer so highly because they want to brag that they drank it. In a blind taste test of the world's best IPAs, Heady Topper would lose miserably."

"Overall - Well done. Worth the hype. Would like to rate after having fresh from brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Upon first drinking this, I thought it was extremely over hyped. But when you realize you've hit the middle of the can in 2 minutes, you'll understand it's drinkability. This isn't the most aggressive IPA out there, the ABV is a bit high; however, considering it is a DIPA, I'd say this brew is spot on. It's a great brew; however, to you that are buying this on the gray market, I strongly suggest not paying more than $8 a can. These run $12 a 4 pack in Burlington and I've seen locations out here in Los Angeles reselling them for $12 a can. This is completely ridiculous... It's a great experience to try, but don't get taken advantage of. Cheers!"

"I can see why they say to drink from the can. It's a cloudy, murky yellow amber color with a slight head. It reminds me of homebrew in how it looks. I guess I have gotten used to super bright IPA's like the ones from Stone. The appearance is the only knock. The smell is magnificent. Super citrus, pine and resin. Upon tasting, I really can't believe the lack of bitterness that does not come with all that hop flavor. The hop flavor must come from a killer hop stand. Small amount of sweetness at the end of the sip, but make no mistake, this is all about hop flavors and aromas. I've never had an IPA quite like this. Mouthfeel is moderate and well-carbonated. Overall, this is a new type of IPA that I will look out for. Huge hop flavor and aroma and slight bitterness. This one kills it!"
"This beer lives up to the hype. I can't get enough of it."
""
""
""
"O: Amazing brew! It really seems like other great DIPAs have just a piece of this ones overall complex puzzle. The fruity citrus of Sculpin, the smooth balance of Pliney, and the drink ability of Dorado are represented here and just as well as its counterparts! Top of it's class and damn near perfect!"
""
""
"Either way, this is a world class example that I hope the alchemist can continue to produce at this level for a long time."
""
"Drank it from the can as advised (6 days old) and also poured into pint glass. Lived up to the hype. Lugged some back to CA, drank it side-by-side with Pliny. In that pantheon. Loved visiting the brewery in Waterbury -- simply evil that it is essentially next door to Ben and Jerry's. Evil."

"If you've never had it, or fear you never will, take solace in the fact that HT gets less unique every year of this craft beer era. Sure, I've still never had this perfect combination of flavors and craftsmanship, but you've tasted everything in HT before.

"Picked this baby up from a great friend at the Borefts Bier Fest! It's a little over a week since it was canned so it's super fresh. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Fresh, dank, resiny hops totally dominate the nose along with some great perfumey, floral and citrus notes. This is one of those really special smelling beers that you'll always remember. The taste is just as big and bold. It starts off like the nose as a total fresh hop monster, full of resiny pine and bitter grapefruit along with some nice tropical notes. About midway through there's a measure of balance as some of the caramel malt sweetness emerges along with some orange peel, tangerine, and a bit of grassiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oddly creamy for an IPA. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable for such a big, hoppy beer. Overall, not sure it lived up to all the hype, but still one hell of a beer!"

"What else really needs to be said? Had a taste from the tap but reviewing based on 1 pint cans.Both are my first experiences with Heady. It's perfect. Beautiful pale hazy yellow when poured, which I did with 1 of 4 cans I've had so far. Delicious, smooth and flavor-filled. Hits all the right notes. Little floral, little citrus and a little pine lumped together into a spectacular punch of flavor. Spent 10 hrs in a car to bring this home and it was worth every second."
"Murky golden orange color with a fat layer of off-white foam on the surface. Deep, dank, fresh bag-o-hops smell...spicy, resinous pine, pungent, juicy citrus, and peaches. An almost toffee-ish malt profile lurks underneath. Huge hoppy flavor (obviously): fresh floral hop cones, grapefruit, pine needles, stone fruit, maybe some tropical fruit. Seems kind of like a lot of Simcoe to me. Dry, smooth,and textured. Bitter, but nothing crazy. This is a great, supremely hopped-up DIPA that manages to stay really drinkable. A bit too hyped up, but undeniably impressive."

"Pours a very murky, glowing orange color, similar to a hefeweizen. looks very pulpy. The aroma is similar to smelling a handful of fresh hop pellets on a brewery tour. resinous, out of control sharp hop notes of grapefruit, pine, some pineapple maybe and fresh cut peaches. Really great nose. The taste is much of the same as the aroma but with a big juicy feel to it that makes this drinkable. not overly bitter as i would have expected which adds to the drinkability. The mouthfeel is medium bodied since its unfiltered and has a chewy character to it. Really great beer, perfect for all seasons for sure."

"It's amazing how easy it is to drink, but it's just that good."

"This is everything a beer should be amazing drinkability great odor and taste this is just everything that I could possibly want in a beer experience. The presentation of the can is perfect and well worth the journey into the middle of no where Vermont. While 72 for a case may seem high I would be willing to spend over and over again."
"Serving type: can (and a cool can at that)"
""
""

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. This is a world class beer, if you ever get the chance to try it don't hesitate. It's near perfection in a can."

"First time having this brew. I must say it lived up to the hype for sure. great hoppy taste and not too bitter. very easily drinkable. I would choose this over any other ipa/dipa available. the only negative thing I can say about it is it's availability. I wish I didn't have to have it shipped out to Las Vegas! Cheers!"

"Was everything I hoped it to be. Thank you Danny Mac for sharing! I wish I had just one more sip, then one more can. Everyone can write more descriptive reviews, I just wanted to tell about the experience. Read a ton of opinions and this was one of the few that I whole heartedly agree with. If you have it, I am jealous, if you can find it, count yer blessings! If you have an extra share it with a friend. Drink, be fat and happy all!"

"edit: the girlfriend made a point- 2 cans of heady topper is the max you want to drink- diminishing returns on the pleasure of drinking this scarce commodity of a beer. Two leaves you satisfied."
""

"Overall, do I think this is the best IIPA or IPA I've ever had? Probably not. The hype train oversells this one a bit, but it is a damn good beer. I will seek it out again in trades and savor this one while I have it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the can. Aroma is very strong, lots of floral hops. Pours a nice golden color and white head. Taste is very strong hops that take over the more you sip it. It is one of the cloudiest beers I have ever seen. You can taste the resin right away and it is not a bad thing! This is my favorite DIPA to date."

""
""
""
"I really don't feel the is anything I """can""" add to this wonderful beer the only reason it feel short of perfect is because I can't drink any other beer with it, nothing before and nothing after. If I drink something before I simply don't enjoy heady as much and if I drink something after I lose the desire for beer. Other then that it is wonderful, But I have to session it by itself have 2 or 3 and call it a night."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Great beer. It isn't my favorite beer in the world but I understand why it resides at the top of the rankings. If you nitpick the flavor profile, you can judge it to be just like any other world class or outstanding IPA/DIPA. However, this beer needs to be considered as more than the sum of its parts. It is constantly involving in the mouth even after a drink has been taken. It never even approaches boring- there are different notes constantly appearing. Definitely worth a try if you can get some."

"OVERALL : Among the best brews I've had. I probably wouldn't go so far as to call this the best beer in the world (too much amazing stuff out there) but it's definitely up there, way up there. I bought a 4-pack 3 days ago on-location at the brewery and I'll probably review this one tomorow, for the sake of comparison. And also to give me an acceptable excuse to drink another one."
""
""
""
""
"A DIPA worthy of its stature, but for reasons I did not quite expect - this is a hop bomb, sure, but more of the neutron variety - the attack leaves the infrastructure (i.e. my tastebuds) intact. It's all about flavour here, rather than overt bitterness or astringency, and while my mind remains unequivocally unblown, I can surely admit that this is the best combination of tasty and easy-drinking that I have ever encountered in the style. Oh, and I took a sip out of the can before I poured it - seemed the same to me."

"This was one of the great Craft Beer experiences that I've tasted. And after what my Mother-In-law went through to get it for me I had great expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. Great taste and finish. A beer that I could drink every day, if I could get enough."

"Overall- Very, very nice. Easy to see how they'd limit it to 12 cans/person even with a year-round release. Not the most flavor-blasted or bold DIPA on the market, but it's... quality. Don't know how else to put it- these guys aren't messing around, it's one of the freshest and most well put-together beers I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Unique mellow-ish flavor balance- perhaps the most """balanced""" DIPA I've had, who knew that was a thing? Drool-worthy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: without question one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Very balanced and very flavorful with huge notes of citrus and biscuit balancing each other. Medium finish and drinkable body makes for an incredibly well made beer."
"I love this beer a lot and appreciate the fact that such a good beer is made in my home state, It will get you twisted pretty quick because to me I couldn't really taste the alcohol but instead the delicious floral hops. When I was at Nectar's bar, everyone had a Heady Topper!"

"Overall, I would drive 4.5 hours one-way to get this beer again. Awesome beer to share with friends that appreciate well crafted beer."
""
"Acquired more via trade. While drinking and reviewing my original review, I can't bring myself to change any ratings. Surprisingly. I can however, and obviously, say that it is worth trading for more than 1 time. Having had more beer than I care to count in between my original review and now, I can say that Heady is one that I have consistently looked forward to. There just aren't any other IPAs that can capture the essence of hops the way The Alchemist does with Heady. Cheers, 'till the next one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sometimes I even strain the floaters out of it. It's a local beer for me and in my opinion it is not the number one beer as BA notes it to be. With so many area colleges near by the students tend to over rate this beer. Far better in my opinion is Lawson's Spirits """Double Sunshine"""."
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a great beer that I would drink more often than I can find it in Southern California. If anyone is heading to the LA area from an area where you can get this, I'll pay you with my first born child! Just kidding, but seriously this is a great DIPA. I still think that Pliny has it beat for my top beer, but for different reasons. The proprietary Conan yeast is really great, it let's the hop flavors come through while enhancing them and not muddling them. I think that the low amount of coagulation that the yeast gives is part of the reason for the creaminess."
"O: This is incredible. Enough said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured just a little bit into a glass, to see the color. It says to drink it from the can. It has a light burnt orange color it. The aroma is strong piney hops. The taste is a little bitter than the citrus comes in. At the end the hops bite your tongue like a rattlesnake. It leaves a bitter after taste and overall one hell of a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great stuff. Nothing bad about this beer. I homebrew, and if I was going to personally brew this beer I might go with a little less upfront bitterness and a little more over the top late addition/dry hop fruitiness, but I think they did a great job balancing things out with dank hops."

"Overall, really top notch, of course."
"I understand why this beer has won praise and accolades from beer enthusiasts all over the world but to me it is about the same as Shipyard Pugsley's XXXX and Smuttynose IPA."
""
""
"O: Heady Topper truly holds it's own in the upper echelon of incredible brews. The scent and flavours are dialled up as intensely as could be possible, while still offering the drinker a fresh hoppiness and sweet malts. The lingering bitters hold onto the tongue like a drowning man to a life raft. A treat for any hop head looking for a stunning mix of hops and malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is without a doubt right up there as the best IPA/DIPA I have ever had. Believe the hype and accolades this beer receives because it deserves every single one of them. What John Kimmich and his crew are able to bring out of hops is something like I have never tasted in a beer before and quite frankly I didn't know was possible. This beer pushes the envelope of not only what an IPA/DIPA can be, but beer in general. This stuff is absolute liquid gold in a can and if you like hops then you must taste it sometime in your life. Amazing amazing stuff"
""
"Bottom line: This beer is amazing. Worth the $50/4pk it goes for online if you've never had it. Otherwise, find a VT-er who can send you a steady stash for your own great locals."
""
""
"The only problem is that you cant find it anywhere! So... they should change the name for """TUMOR"""! Cause every store we visited had the same reply: Sorry, no stock, We get it TUesday MORning and absolutely evey can goes out the door TUesday MORning: Seeya tuesday!"

"Tasted on 11/11/11 from a can shared by ryan585, thanks Ryan. Pours murky orange with a very thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace, with some chunky sediment. The nose is intense orange peel citrus, resin bitterness, chewable kids vitamins, caramel malt, and a touch of earthy yeast. The flavor is orange and grapefruit peel, bitter resin, chewable kids vitamins, the same earthy yeast, and just enough caramel malt to keep everything in balance. The body is medium with an oily texture, lighter than average carbonation, and a very long resin and citrus peel bitter finish."
""
"Another update: This one comes from nightrider, a friendly trader in California that has gotten me my freshest can yet! This can has traveled 5,000 miles and it’s the freshest one I’ve had, go figure.Super resiny, piney, grapefruity hoppy aroma. More potent that I remember. Soft mouth feel. Very sappy, resiny, richly piney, grapefruit citrusy, floral hoppy flavor. Very fresh hops. Nice as always."

"Overall heady won the battle.. matter of fact Heady was the best """BEER""" I've ever had period and clearly won the whole thing.. plineys appearance as far as color goes was better but heady had a better head and lacing... smelt a tad... just a schmidging better than pliney (pliney was a bit sweeter which i liked but heady was balnced) and blew pliney away on taste, mouthfeel and overall.. if you have not tried this beer yet than shame on you.... and shame on them for not having this beer readily available as they do with bmc product... this is deserving of the best dipa and #1 overall."
""
"I absolutely love this beer. The first time I had it I wasn't overly impressed. Since then it has grown on me and I love it. I had been shying away from IPA's and there were few DIPA's I really enjoyed. Since having Heady several times over the last month I keep drinking more and more DIPA's only to be disappointed that it doesn't live up to Heady. Some may match it in 1 or 2 area's but I don't think there is an IPA or any style I would rather drink than Heady."

"My first shot at HT and I have to say, it wasn't what I expected. I was expecting a hop bomb being a dipa at 8% abv but it wasn't. Definitely the most well balanced ipa/dipa I have ever had. Taste and mouth feel were definitely great (alcohol was very well hidden). Appearance and smell were very good but not the best. Overall it was an awesome beer and I can't wait to have it again!"
"If you look at the list of my top rated beers, you will see that my personal preference leans towards bourbon barrel aged beers and stouts. I don't know if an IPA is a style that I would rank ahead of some of my favorite darker beers. That said, this beer was outstanding and I am glad I got the chance to try it."
"Poured out of the can (you don't own me Jon kimmich) into an HT stemless glass. Pours cloudy, a few floaters, nice orange color. To me this beer has the perfect smell. So floral and citrusy. I go to the cannery if I'm in VT, even if they are out, mostly because of the aroma there. Taste is outstanding. So citrusy, with a very complementing bitterness. This beer is worth the 7 hour round trip i take just for a couple cases. There's a reason it's #1."
""
""
"since this review, ive made my trips up to vermont a couple of times for cases instead of the marked up 4pack i found on long island...i also since have poured it once into a glass and i personally love the cloudy bright yellow-orange look....i have fallen more and more in love with this beer each time i have it and i have to say its my favorite beer at this point...nothing like it...5 across the board"

"Finally able to try this, thank you lucas1801. Pours a hazy golden orange color. Smells is heavy citrus, orange and tangerine. Taste is very citrusy kinda like the citrus notes in Jai Alai, not overly hoppy. Overall this beer is worth seeking out and unlike any other IPA I have had."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a wonderful beer. Number one in the world? Eh... Not sure. That's something you'll have to decide for yourself. But what I can say is that it's an amazing beer and well well worth the try. If you can get it, get it. Drink it and enjoy."
""
""

"Drinkability: It's impossible to say what's the best, but as far as DIPAs go, this is up there, at least in my top three. Many are, I imagine, saying the same thing, versus some you've reviewed and have in your mind, with matching characteristics and equally good balanced. Don't pay an arm and a leg for this, I'd say, but I'm thrilled I got to try it, and if it comes across again, I'll definitely be one who's ready to crack it open and enjoy it."

"O - Insanely drinkable for a IIPA. I had this at 12pm which is usually way too early for me but I couldn't pass it up. Still went down now and easy. The key to this beer's greatness is its balance. All the flavors and aromas meld so well together and compliment each other wonderfully."

"O: Overall this is an impossibly drinkable DIPA. If had access to this brew I would pay the $3 a can and drink it every day. Can't wait to have the opportunity to do a blind side by side with the likes of Pliny and a few Alpines. It's the only way to really rank these top contenders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the whole... """lush""" is the word that comes to mind here. From the raw hop juiciness of the flavor profile to the creaminess of the feel, this is a deceptively smooth beer for the intensity of hop flavor it packs. Delicious and well worth the effort necessary to procure it."

"I live in South Florida (not a place well known for it's beer) so I had to look northward to the second least populated state in the USA for great beer. I was begging my relatives, clients, Ebay posters and friends to find a way to get me a try since I saw that Heady was the world's top rated beer on Beer Advocate. Finally, one of my friends came thru and told me my prayers had been answered and a case was on its way last week. After inspecting the case to make sure all cans were on hand and in great shape I began my personal journey. I have now concluded that Heady Topper is far and away the finest quality beer made, should be deemed a national treasure and is the best tasting Imperial IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. As smooth as a great brew could be with hints of grapefruit,1st rate hops, blood orange citrus, delicate cream and subtle pine. I am truly fortunate to be able to share my case of Heady with my beer friends and hope you are able to find a way to get a few cans to savor yourself. Please let me know when you have finished your first can, if you feel the way I do send me a personal note. Cheers to all!"

"O - with a month of age, it had only lost that brewery fresh wet hop dankiness, the flavor is still huge. I feel this is excellent, but I put it at about the same level of greatness as some other great IPAs such as enjoy by and sucks. Worth the 4 hour drive to VT, but not the be all end all of IPAs."

"Hazy peach-ornage colour, ring of white head with some spots of lace as well. Smell is all out tropical fruit, orange, peach flesh, light pine and some floral earthy points with a touch of malt in the back as well, nice fruity hop nose though. Taste is a mix of citrus fruit, tangerine, orange grapefruit, a little bit of white grape, assertive bitterness throughout but never tastes to bitter, certainly more hop flavour here as opposed to hop bitterness, a light sweetness present before a long dry hoppy finish. Lightly carbonated, oily and quite slick, medium-full body. Incredible stuff, insanely drinkable and something I would love to have a fridge full of as I could drink this daily and probably never get tired of it."

"Hops, Hops, and more Hops. Bright gold, with an orange tint appearance. As can instructs, you have to drink it out of the can, and in turn reminds me of college beer nights while tasting much better. Extremely hoppy to the first taste, smooth but also foamy in your mouth, and finishes with a less bitter than expected after taste. Spoiled rotten to work in Montpelier where almost all significant restaurants carry Heady Topper now. Simply no debate, it is No. 1 for a reason. MUST TRY!!!"

"Obviously its rarity and the lengths you need to go to obtain it help the myth. But, and I humbly apologize for saying this, but this beer doesn’t live up to the hype. It is amazing, don’t get me wrong, definitely deserves to be in the top 100 of BA, but no way in the top 10, let alone #1. It’s on par with other stellar DIPA’s like Hercules or Pliny or Hopulance or Kiwi Rising, but isn’t vastly better than any of the others. But as they say, that’s just my opinion. Still an amazing beer, but… the hype and shortage of this beer have made it more popular than it probably should be. Oh well… I’m still going to enjoy the rest of the case I bought. :-)"
"Holy god almighty. More!"
"I appreciate IPAs and DIPAs that are beautifully executed as such; I don't partake in IBU pissing contests because sometimes being the bitterest is not better."

"O- overall a FANTASTIC double ipa. If you are a hop head this will not let you down. I recommend trying both from a tulip glass and the can....they are both great in their own right. Definitely worth trying to find...it took me a while but worth the wait!"
"Find it. Drink it. Decide for yourself. It is worth it."

"Pours a golden amber with a two-finger off-white head. No """floaties""" that many reviewers speak of. Nice lacing. A complex and unique aroma. Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a top two or three DIPA that is truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)!"

"Overall: (3.5) Good beer. Seems more like an IPA than a DIPA, but maybe that is a bonus, more alcohol with the IPA flavor. Regardless, very smooth and drinkable with a long lingering hop flavor on the back of the tongue."

"Very good IPA."

"No real appearance, since I took the suggestion and drank directly from the can. However, I popped the top, and it immediately smelled like I was in the middle of Shenandoah Valley. One of my favorite places to go hiking/camping with my dad. Heady is clean, slightly piney, sweetly floral, and rather bright in aroma. The taste is really light for the 8% ABV. A great hop presence on the tongue, and sweet/bitter combination from the malt/hops. Surprisingly, the piney-ness of the hops isn’t bothering me. I typically don’t like that in my IPAs, and tend to stick towards brighter/more tropical offerings. Short duration on the tongue, which is making me drink this beer faster than I normally would have. My first HT thanks to a trade from lhteacher"

"Brilliantly constructed from the ground up. Probably the best IPA I've ever had, and I've had a few. """Party in your mouth""" seems a pretty apt term for this beer."
"O: Well, I can see what all the hulla balloo is all about. This beer is hardcore hops and proves its value in my mouth. There have been some discussions about the comparison between pliny and this beer. Simply put, they cannot be compared, they are both outstanding beers with unique and ingenious characteristics which shine to each's own. Simply put: drink this beer, it will make you happy. 4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5 (~4.5)"
""
"Hard not to be swayed by perfect scores and its all time ranking, but one additional bonus I'd give the Heady is its availability. I realize it's not available nationwide but the fact that's its so readily available in Vermont, that combined with how small the northeast is, he'll my friend said it was the easiest prettiest 2 hour one way drive he's ever made. Unlike PtY or PtE which are retry difficult to find, PtY being impossible aside from 2 weeks, Heady can be found. I give it a 99 just because only the Westy 12 i can so far consider perfect, but let me assure you this is a mere technicality, get your hands on it you won't be disappointed"

"Testing it between can and glass, I prefer the glass. The glass lets the carbonation roll around your tongue to outer mouth, which gives it more fruit flavor and creamy mouthfeel."
""
"It didnt have an appearance as i didnt see it, excellent beer that is dangerous. The 4 pack was gone in an hour. The bitter grapefruit taste makes Heady spectacular. Like stated before, dnagerously easy to drink."

"I just came back from a 3 day mini vacation from Vermont, I talked my wife into going to see this """beautiful state""" we dragged our 16 year old boy with us, after 1 day in Vermont it was pretty obvious why we were there in the summer.... dad's lust for the """Holy Grail """ The Alchemist brewery and heady topper.. We stayed at Green mountain inn ( very nice ) and did enjoy the mountain views at smugglers notch, anyway Heady topper was everything I hoped it would be. I was at the hotel's pub when I got my long awaited first can, my wife and son were looking at me like I was nuts, I cracked open the brew and low and behold it was liquid gold. Sorry for the not very scientific review, but it's that good!!"

"Got these via a trade with someone from New Hampshire so I'm not sure how fresh they are. I believe he bought them before he shipped them to me. My first impression was not that great for an IPA. It initially tasted just liked steeped hops. Almost like someone just made tea with a bag of hops. Maybe I was drinking it too cold. My second and third cans seemed much better. Maybe I just had to appreciate it more. I still think there are other better DIPA's out there in my opinion. If you love hops then this is the beer for you as it is all hops and nothing else."

"You simply cannot beat this beer. It looks very cool in the silver can, it tastes amazing, hoppy with low bitterness, it smells gloriously fresh and somewhat citrusy. Smooth. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. It's quite delicious. At first I thought it was over ratted by the time I finished my can, I was converted."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, its not my favorite IPA, but it sure is close. Additionally, for the price, this beer is tough to beat. Very tasty IPA with lots of bitterness and moderate citrus. Definite buy if I can get my VT cousin to bring me back more."
""
""
""
"A decent beer, but would be *much* better with different hops. I find Summit hops sickening and can't wait for the trend to pass on by. Big disappointment. Judged to style, so scored higher than my palette would offer. The can says """drink from the can!""" It was not as good from a can as from a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great DIPA. I can see where all the hype comes from, definitely an easy drinking, tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is close to perfect, tons of flavor that hides the alcohol and it is super drinkable for a DIPA. I prefer it straight from the can."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like it. Is it the greatest IPA ever? Maybe its the hype, but I don't think so. Its a great beer and worthy of an A/A+ rating, but I still think beers like Double Sunshine, Maharaja, and Pliny are more memorable. I will enjoy and share this case with friends."
""
""
"I have one person to thank for this mrKennedy what a brilliant unexpected bday present you are the man and I know they say drink out the can but this definitely deserves a glass and pours a cloudy pineapple juice hue with a fluffy cloud like three finger head and lacing everywhere looks so inviting,the smell is pineapples,piney hops,tangerines,grapefruit and a tonne of Valencia oranges,the mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and medium bodied with tastes of pineapples,mangoes,grapefruit,tangerines and finished with a soft citrus bittersweetness and overall what a sublime AIPA it's right up there with the best I've tried and just wish this and the rest of their range was available here cheers."
""
""
""
"I love this beer. I am making a pilgrimage to Vermont later in the summer and I hope I luck into a couple cases. It is truly one of the best brews I have ever had."
""
""
"O: A pretty good DIPA overall. Lots of earthy hop characters without being overly bitter. I wish the aroma were a bit more pungent, but what's there is nice."
""
""
"The Alchemist, you brilliant, brilliant brewers. You sell over 90% of your product from your own brewery…. And I know that you know you’ve made one of America’s best beers. And I know that you are proud of it… and you should be. This gem is to be savored, enjoyed and drank straight from the can. Do it, don’t even consider pouring this into a glass… just drink it from the can. Lick your lips, say “ahhh” and beg your friends to get in their cars and go buy more."
"Overall: This beer is so much more then just another hop bomb that you continually see today. A beer with truly complex character, balance, and hop presence. I got a case of this from a friend and thought about trading some, but I think I'll just be selfish and keep them all. An all-timer in my book, no doubt lives up to every bit of the hype."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe we can get by on 18?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I don't know if this would be the best tasting beer in the world for me, but it was definitely the most complex and interesting tasting beer I've ever had."
""
"Overall: impressive. hyped to the point of disbelief and still surprised me a little with it's uniqueness. I don't know if this is the """best beer on earth""" but it is certainly unique and wonderful in it's own way."
"World class ipa not just for the hopheads but in general. Even if you do not like ipas you have to give this a try. It's like biting into a hoppy pineapple without a hint of its true abv. Simply amazing.  Follow directions and do not pour in a glass..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its either an IPA or DIPA, not sure which one. Reveal is HEADY TOPPER... WoW I remember this being an almost perfect beer in the past. Wonder if its me that changed?"
""
""
""
""
"Finally. Pours a hazy light orange. Crazy hoppy smell, citrusy. Taste is really nice. Hoppy, but light for the style. Citrusy. Mouthfeel is really nice n creamy. Overall, over rated. Very solid DIPA, top 5 for sure, but over rated. Num 1 in the world, I think not. Not as hoppy as most from 3 floyds. Seek out 3 floyds before you seek this out."
""
""
""
"I smelled like from the can, since the can insists you enjoy from the can. I just wanted to smell more. Nothing too explosive. I wanted a bit more, but it is probably because I am smelling from a can. Perfect tasting east coast IPA. There are nice citrus and pine notes along with a little caramel creamy-ness. The hops are pleasant and not overwhelming."
"Taste is really very nice, first you are hit with a pleasant sweetness and flavors of bitter citrus, juicy hops and pineapple. Finishes with a smooth bitter kick. Very creamy and nice mouthfeel. Overall a very nice IPA. Well balanced and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O= I wasn't expecting much from this beer to be honest. I figured it would be just another super hoppy IPA. This is a unique beer however. It transcends most IPAs in the way that the hops are so flavorful and fruity. This beer is better than I expected somehow. I can't explain it really. Worth seeking out and trying over and over."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. The balance that is struck between the hops alone is incredible and beautiful, with sticky sweet fruity nectars and citrus battling, blending, and then giving way to a stronger herbal component through the finish shows variability throughout the sip, punch at each stop, and precise progression along the palate. The fact that it took us over an hour to rate this guy, and across several cans no less, speaks to both its complexity and depth, as well as to its utterly simple and remarkable ease of drinkability. The mouthfeel is smooth, frothy, sticky to the lips, and coating, striking just the right combination to keep your mouth and buds wanting more, more, and more. While every aspect of this masterpiece shines, it is the taste that stays with you the most, and will, at least for the next few nights to come, keep us up at night thinking about it."

"Overall: It was interesting to drink this beer as it got older. The first can I drank, on the day it was canned, was pretty incredible. The last can I drank, just under four weeks old, was a very good, solid beer. Insanely tasty and drinkable, lived up to the hype for me. Glad I was able to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really happy with this beer. I will need to try it side by side with Pliny to really sort out the nuances of each, but each is great in its own right. I'm finding myself drinking this dangerously quickly -- I am pretty glad I don't have enough of these to just enjoy at will and open in series, or I could end up very drunk very quickly. I was worried that this beer would be a little too dank for me, but that really hasn't been the case at all. I don't suspect that the beer has """lost""" this since canning, so I think perhaps I just had unfounded worries. Great beer."

"o) fantastic beer. i had been sitting on this beer for 3 nights before i tried it and the anticipation was a bit ridiculous (i mean its just beer) and it totally delivered."

"This is beer crack. I want more."
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a stark white bubbly head. The aroma is great. The second the can pops you can smell the hops. The aroma is of piney hops and floral hops. It smells like an earthly flower shop. The taste follows suit, there is no ripe your face of bitterness just a great blended flavor. The malts are there as the backbone, but the hops play out with piney earthy hops up front before a floral and citrus hop flavor comes through at the end. The mouthfeel is perfect. Overall this beer is as good as advertised. A great beer a must try."

"The hype of this beer made me want it. Got it on a beer trade from a bloke in nj. Opened the can and dug my nose in it... So delicious. Super hop aroma and pine. Put a chug in my mouth and swished it around like scope and put it down. Then came. Nothing more."
""
"O) Glad I was finally able to board this hype train. It took a long time to finally get the opportunity, but this one is worth seeking out for any hop lover. Only got one can, so staring at it now completely empty is a bit of a bummer. Anyone in Vermont looking to get their hands on some New Glarus beer?"
""
""
""
""
"I can honestly say this was a perfect beer for me. Everything worked together and nothing was over or underpowered. Simply amazing."
"All in all it is a great beer, too bad they dont distribute more of it, because i would buy a case"
"The price is right and the taste is too. Absolutely a world class beer. Glad I can get a steady stream of this because for a dipa it can't be beat."
""
""
""
"O. What more can be said about this gem. It's a true hop monster. When absolutely fresh, it's an untamed beast. When several months old, it remains a marvelously balanced DIPA. The utter lack of a classic malt profile is the real kicker here, and it's what makes this beer stand out against other well known DIPAs."
""
"This is easily in the top five Imperial IPAs I've ever had to date. It's extremely balanced, flavorful and never lets up on the delicious hop abuse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Excellent experience. I was expecting an excellent IIPA and that's exactly what I've got"
""
""
"I do feel like Im nit picking this beer, and there are some fantastic hop notes that really come out, but I am really looking for a bit more character here. Well it's a good thing no one really reads these reviews anyways."
""

""
""
""
""
"Worth the Hype? Idk, it depends on what you have to go through to get it. After all, it IS still a beer...but in my opinion, if you've been questing for this one, keeep at it. I lived in MA for most of my life and spent the last couple years trying to track this one down to no avail. Moved all the way down to NC and within the first 2 months got it as a random gift from a boss at a new job. The irony. Easily one of, if not definitely my favorite of all the IPAs/ DIPAs I've EVER had. Its just got the total package. The drinkability on this one is UNREAL despite being so incredibly flavorful and semi high in alcohol. IPAs arent normally """my thing""" these days but if I had regular access to this beer theres no doubt id be buyin the shit out of it each and every chance I had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Perfectly balanced IPA. Great Hoppy flavor, not overly bitter and very drinkable. The smell hits you when opening the can. The fruity/floral flavor hits your palate instantly and lasts. They recommend that you drink it out of the can, but I tried it both from can and glass and found no difference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow, what a brew. As for the Pliny vs HT debate, no comparison in my mind. They're two different but very special things. It's like trying to say which one of my kids is my favorite."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I don't think there is anything quite like this. I would describe it as liquid hop extract without the bitterness. Just juicy and delicious plus with 16 ounces at 8% you have a nice little buzz afterwards. Can is right, it is so drinkable it's scary."
""
""
"Pretty amazing they can pack this much hop flavor into a beer these days. Lots of bitterness here too. You can tell there is malt in there, but good luck finding a flavor description to attach to it. Just a massive tidal wave of hops - citric, tropical, piney; you name it hop-wise, its here. ABV is well hidden and the flow is nice from the hop flavor to the bitter finish...not halting at all. Definitely a world class beer, good enough to say that if I was transferred to Vermont for work, regualr access to this would be one of the first things to pop into my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer just keeps giving and giving and it's difficult to pin down why you enjoy it so much. You just keep reaching for cans until you realize that it's still an 8% abv brew and you should probably not kill that precious 4-pack by yourself tonight."
""
""
""
"It is definitely a standout beer. Just the hype surrounding it makes it difficult to be impartial. In a few words, it's a very well balanced DIPA with a massive citrusy blast . In my opinion the citrus is what makes it unique. Would I put it @ #1?... not sure, it's definitely up there. In any case, it's definitely worth a try. Massive hype aside, this beer will not disappoint even the most picky beer snob."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In short, it is a very tasty beer, but a bit single-faceted to be rated as high as the Plinys. This is more of a grassy hop bomb like Anderson Valley Hop Ottin' than a full-bodied, well-rounded palette pleaser."
"Feel is dry and sparkly. A nice summer time dIPA that hides the abv well."

"O - I knew the hype on this one but have trained myself to go into these things now just expecting a very good beer instead of ecstasy and in that respect I was not disappointed. It's a very good beer. I'll try the next one out of a pint glass and adjust/refine this review. A tornado was coming when I drank this and I figured I'd better go ahead and try the top rated beer in the world before I maybe died (didn't). So next time will be calmer."

""
"O - It lives up the reviews. One of the best beers in the world, and my 2nd favorite beer of all time. So much hoppy taste, but not just for the sake of being big and bitter. The hops are full of flavor, they make you want to drink this fast. So tasty, yet so dangerously drinkable. Certainly a world class beer, it deserves all the praise it gets."
""
"Dunno about this can lark, tho.... :-0 ....having said that - it does accentuate the pine notes and makes for an overall less sweet (and maybe more archetypal) DIPA experience. I'll go the glass, thanks."

"From the can, obviously but poured into a tulip. Huge, overwhelming aromas of fresh pine, peaches, citrus pith & spicy hops; you could seriously sniff this all day long and not get bored. Poured a cloudy amber orange with a thin head, that dies to a fine lace. Well, I wasn’t expecting this...the taste is just so one dimensional with fresh pine, spicy bitter hops...and then nothing. No linger, malt was a bit high, no hint of sweetness, nothing, nada, zilch. There is just no finish!! It’s like drinking a stripped wine. I just don’t know what all the hype is about...oh wait, I do...it’s just hype and everyone is on this train. Your better of drinking O.G. and/or the standard of D.I.P.A.’s i.e. Russian Rivers Pliny the Elder or even Alpine Beer Company Pure Hoppiness a muh more balanced approach to the style. Maybe it was old but I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. If I come across it again I'll give it another shot and do a comparison of HT vs. PtE vs. Pure Hoppiness."
""
"O - Well. I would advise everyone who is fortunate enough to get ahold of the Heady to try it by the pour, and compare it to """straight from the can.""" I'm sure anyone who has had at least two cans in their possession has done this anyway. Delicious. Unforgettable."
""
"A big thanks to Roger at Bestway for GIVING me this beer on Sunday.I know it's snobbery but I can't drink beer out of a can,I hate myself but I just can't.Pours a murky kind of lemony tea looking with a thin white head,the color was hard to pinpoint.Pure hops in the nose,tropical fruit, citrus rind,deep pine resin,and sweet alcohol,all make for a volitile mix.Just hops and lots o' hops on the palate,pine resin,deep overripe tropical fruits,and some bitterness in the finish.It's oily as all get out and slick in the mouth.This beer is pretty damn raw and complex in the hop department to the hilt,bad ass.I love the hop burps!"
"O: Full disclosure, I am firmly placed within the Heady camp of the great DIPA wars. No doubt, having regular access to Heady is one of the greatest joys of living in Vermont. That said, I recognize the danger of the hype surrounding a beer like Heady. I have not drank nearly enough beer--let alone DIPAs--in my life to claim to know what is and is not the best beer--or IPA--in the world. What I can say is that, before first trying Heady Topper on my 21st birthday thanks to a couple generous friends, I absolutely loathed anything IPA, having preferred stouts and the maltier side of the beer spectrum. I never understood the so-called """hopheads""" when all I could taste was overt bitterness and strange combinations of malts and hops. I suspect the primary culprit is the inability of lesser breweries to achieve an ideal hop-malt balance. To this day I still cannot finish most IPAs and DIPAs. Regardless, the perfect score I've given is due to the fact that Heady made me love hops and IPAs. It is undoubtedly the best beer I've had in my short life of drinking and it would be my choice for the only beer to drink for the rest of my life. I plan on staying in Vermont as long as possible to realize this possibility. That said, don't listen to the hype, try it for yourself. Even if you don't think it's God's gift to man, few can discount that its a treat to enjoy at least once."

"Found this little brewery while on vacation up in VT. This is by far one of the best Imperial IPA's I had. It's unfiltered and has an Extremely hoppy aroma with a great balance composure of grains.

"I have been an IPA nut for years now and nothing has compared to Heady Topper. The combination of hop bitterness and citrus flavor with a great mouthfeel make it nearly a perfect beer. I first tried HT back in December and since then have been yearning for more. I have tried to consume more available IPAs but nothing has compared, even other world class beers such as Double Trouble and LagunitasSucks. So today I went up to VT with some friends and picked up 6 cases. No more worrying for me. Its a shame more cannot try this great beer."

I have never drank anything as full bodied, as at times I did not believe that a beer so wonderful could be crafted in the USA. However, I am in love with this beer.. I am hoping to have it again one day."

"Overall - A damn fine beer, yes. #1 beer ever? Probably not. It tastes very natural, very raw and overall, very nice. If you love hops, you'll love this. Keep your expectations in check though. It's simply an awesome DIPA. Nothing more, nothing less. Don't compare it to Pliny. Two totally different beers, in my opinion. And both are great!"
""
""
"O - Winner winner, chicken dinner! This beer is the real deal for any hop head out there. This brew hits all the right notes with me, and I have a hard time finding any flaws with it. Great smell, amazing taste, no alcohol burn. If I could only have 1 IPA to drink for the rest of my life, this would be the one. Cheers to you Jeremy, for without you this awesome expierence would not be possible."
""
""
"O: 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. Great beer."

"Cloudy, cloudy tangerine body with a thin, white head that fades to a layer of foam atop the ale, leaving a little lace on its way down. Super fresh aroma, with orange rind, grapefruit, juicy fruit gum, mango. Taste is super fresh again here, with loads of mango, orange rind, mandarin, bitter grapefruit juice, grassy, a little nutty as it warms. Creamy and smooth medium-full body, lower carbonation, finishes bitter but not overly - more like grapefruit juice. Insanely balanced and drinkable. I'll need to get a hold of this again....for my wife. First ever IPA or DIPA she liked! I'll have to try it directly from the can next time."

"Edit: had on draft at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. If you didn't think Heady could get any better...try it on draft! WOW! Absolutely unbelievable. The pinnacle of a hop journey through craft beer."
""
"O - thank god I finally tried this beer just enjoy it if you can. worth going to Vermont for."
"Wow. I kept reading the hype but finally got some of this. What an incredible beer. The aroma from the can is full....but not overpowering. The taste....is refreshing. So refreshing. The aftertaste is a wonderful complement. The ranking of this beer is not hype. I am half way through the can and know I would drive a far distance to load up on this."

""
""

"O: This is not going to be my highest rated beer, because of the appearance score, but I think it's my favorite. It's worth every bit of the hype. Make some good friends in Vermont, kids."
""
""
"Drinking from a 16 ounce can, per the can's request. Thanks for this one Cheesemoose. No freshness date. I'm told that this is a """fresh""" can. Still not sure why everyone isn't dating their beers. Popped the can, aroma is bursting out of the little hole, pine, grapefruit, packed full of hops, awesome aroma. Taste is resinous and flavorful. Mainly grapefruit but notes of grass and pine. Totally juiced with flavor. Even the burps taste good."
""
""
"O - While I'm not on par with the appearance, everything else is solid about this beer, though its not my favorite, nor do I think its worth all the hype. Compared to Pliny, its a no-contest situation, its thoroughly better. This actually delivers, lots of good aroma and the taste is solid, love the big grape flavor in this. Its a shame Alchemy is being too hipster to expand and make other things, or even distribute more."
""
"O - This beer is SO FREAKING DRINKABLE!! That is really what stands out the most to me. It doesn't overpower with hops, but puts them on an evenly mixed display that allows you to enjoy every single sip. There is a reason this is on the top ofthe food chain (on this site anyway). Either way, this reallh does deserve the accolades it has received thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I can understand why people rave about this beer. I found myself saying several time, """Mmm, this is quite good. I'm really impressed""" I rarely say that about IPAs. I'll happily drink this again. And again."
""
"I didn't see the beer in a glass as I drank it from the can as recommended, but I imagine it is beautiful judging from the smell. I also drank it a little on the cold side... to thirsty to wait. Taste is fruitful and as smooth as in Imp IPA gets. Hoppy as hell in the best way. Again, very smooth. I drink IPA's 90% of the time and I cant say I have had a better beer."

"O- understand why this is the number one beer in the world. Is it the best or my favorite beer? No. But there is nothing wrong with it."
"Very smooth on the mouthfeel with excellent golden color. Very complex flavors, including a slight metallic taste which is common to IPA's of this type. Overall, excellent in all categories. The brewer encourages one to drink from the can, which isn't typical, but definitely adds to the experience."

"Overall a highly drinkable and flavorful beer. I was admittedly skeptical given the level of praise surrounding this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. The beer was pretty damn close to the hype that preceded it. UPDATE: in the future, I would follow the advice on the can. The taste suffers little to none, and even though the aroma is a little more restrained straight out of the can, looking at the floaties is more of a negative than the lack of smelling out of a glass."

"O- I have had many of the top 250 beers in the recent months and in most cases they did not live up to the hype. This is not one of those cases. Amazing from when you first pop the top to when you take your last sip. Absolutely outstanding beer and it deserves its #1 rating hands down. I had one when I first got to the tasting and then went beer shopping and had to stop and have another on the way out because it makes you crave its deliciousness. Easily my favorite beer that I have had to date."
""
""
""
"OV: An exceptionally well done brew. Flavourful, balanced and a bit chewy for a DIPA, which I like about it. Good lingering flavours that make you want to keep drinking and the ABV is well hidden. At this point, I would say Heady Topper and Lawson's Double Sunshine are the best DIPAs I've had so far. I'm not going to say which I think is better as I like each for different reasons and am just glad I got to try them both. In a perfect World, I'd have access to both whenever I wanted instead of having to drive 7hrs to Vermont to get a limited amount."
""
"Overall: I think the hoppiness quotient is where it needs to be- which balances out the sweet maltiness that predominated the older can. It does come together in a better way which I definitely appreciate. It's hoppy as hell though in a very non-subtle manner, though not as much as Abrasive is. Pliny is hoppy in a more subtle way- mainly in the aroma and flavour (intense grapefruit and citrus), but not so much the bitter aftertaste like Heady gets that starts burning off my palate. Very excellent DIPA, just a bit behind Pliny and Abrasive in my book. (4.5)"

"O: To be honest, I didn’t want to bother with this review. Just wanted to drink the beer. I was afraid that I wasn’t going to love this, but no worries....it’s delicious."
""
""
""
"Simply put, this is the best DIPA out there. Do what you have to do to get some if you haven't had it, and if you have had it I'm sure you're acquiring trade bait to get more. Find a trade partner in Vermont because this stuff is unmatched."
""
""
"SIck aroma. crazy hop flavor. literally tastes like the hop storage room at the brewery i work at smells like. great mouthfeel, feels like such a light beer. almost a different experience drinking straight from the can. same mouthfeel but a bigger hop blast. this beer is obviously insanely hyped and for good reason. i could drink a case. even at 8% it feels like a sessionable ipa"
""
""
""
""
"the taste is not that bitter at all....it's like super hop orange juice that is very drinkable. it keeps you coming back. very easy to drink given the abv level and hop usage. very glad I got to try this and will drink it out of the can next time to see if there is any difference given there recommendation."
""
""
""
"i searched low and high for this bad boy. i listened to the directions and drank straight from the can. no idea how old it was when i got it. IPA's are my go to all the time, and this thing is awesome. i will say not worth the $15 a can ive seen charged for it, but i'd drop an easy $8 on it."
""
""
"It is easy drinking for such a hoppy beer, I would almost call it juicy. Really kicks ass."
""
"UPDATE (1/6/2014): I pitted this against some other DIPAs of similar nature (no Pliny), and this was the loser overall. All were about 2 months old. This is really good, but best consumed fresh - it becomes more piney and funky over time, and loses a lot of its fresh squeezed juicy flavors that I enjoy in the style. Worth seeking out, but make sure you know the date!"
""
""
""
""
"It poured out a bit murky- I expected it to have been filtered, but the color was a nice golden orange. The aroma was a prelude to nice balance. Exactly what is to be expected from an exquisite IPA- rich pine, citrus and apricot all in a perfect blend- and in that order! The taste was very smooth. I only had two gulps so I had to make them count! Like I said the aromas were a prelude to the taste and it tasted very predictable (which is good) and inviting. The rich flavor profile and dynamic masks the alcohol which is very nice too. I just wish it was filtered to get a more acute, pure flavor without the murk masking anything. The aluminum in the can added to the brightness of flavor. Very close to Pliny the Younger, which nobody could help but compare it to. What makes this slightly inferior was that it is nearly 4% less ABV than Younger and not as smooth. So there. Can't wait for another can! The hunt is on."
""
""
""
"Overall - While I can understand why some people do not regard Heady Topper to be the best beer in the world or even the best double IPA, I personally enjoy Heady Topper in any and all situations. I give this beer a perfect score because no matter my mood, location, or food pairing I can always enjoy a can of HT. John Kimmich is also a super friendly hands on brewer who truly cares about the beer he brings to market."
""
"The single most unique characteristic of this beer is the drinkabililty. Despite the strong flavors, after you are finished, you want more. It should be leaving a strong aftertaste, but it doesn't. In that respect it is a 5/5."
""
"You definitely wanna drink this from the can because it really does enhance the hop flavors compared to pouring it in a glass. This is a great DIPA, but certainly not my favorite. It has very nice flavors, but I prefer a more intense DIPA and more tropical, juicy fruit notes too. Definitely worth trying, but nowhere near perfect in my eyes."
""
"Overall: Awesome...is it my favorite ipa? Definitely not but probably maybe my top 10 but considering what I want in DIPAs. Thank you to Tap and Barrell here in Smithtown for carrying this gem. Salud!"
""
"A wonderful delivery of hop flavor. Not overbearing, but full of flavor, balance is beautiful. Flavor is like the nose, malt bill extremely well hidden and really showcases the hops."
"O/D - A great DIPA. Worthy of the hype IMO. I dunno if it's the best out there at the moment, but hell, it's good. No hint of alcohol, and a beast of a hop monster. Insanely drinkable. If I could have one IPA for the rest of my life, it would be this. Supreme drinkability."

"O - It's amazing how well-balanced this DIPA really is and definitely deserving of the hype. However, I'm not sure if it is the best beer in the world (even in my limited experience, PtY holds that spot for me). Having said that, I will definitely be enjoying the cans I have left and mourn them when they are gone."

"The aroma on this beer is by far the best part. It smells of grass and happiness. Its white head is thick enough for a mustache. But feels light. You could sip or slop this beer and both would taste great. Although it isnt as complexe as I had thought for a Rate 1 beer it is, by all accounts, excellent."
"Overall: A truly mind blowing and unique IPA; Its like John Kimmich at Alchemist took the best attributes of West Coast and East Coast IPAs and combined them; Birght fruity, citrusy hops (west coast)and a sizable slightly chewy mouthfeel(East Coast) but without the super malty back bone. I've never had a beer that really harnessed raw hop character as well as this beer. Smelling this beer is really like sticking your head inside a dry hop bag after home brewing. Alchemist's house yeast """Conan", really shines with it's peach forward esters. Truly magical stuff. While I don't prefer this beer over Pliny(mainly because Pliny is just so damn balanced, crisp and refreshing), this still is a beer every Hop Head should experience. Plus it's in a can! Highly, highly recommended."
"O: Extremely tasty, flavorful brew. Doesn't jump out as the """best beer in the world""" to me however, as the ratings show. Very good, but visually unappealing, and heavier than I'd prefer, but that's just nitpicking"

"one of those beers where even your burps taste good after drinking it, I don't know if its the best in the World but its one of the best DIPA's I've encountered in recent memory and would go far out of my way to acquire more."

""
""

"The beer is excellent overall. A phenomenal nose of citrus starts it off, smooth citrus flavors, cooling and slightly sweet touch the front and mid palate with a trumpet of hoppiness on the finish. A very inviting, thirst quenching, taste-bud delighting IPA."
""
"This beer is hard to get but well worth it if you can. Pours cloudy golden (yes I know you should drink from the can). Smell is spicy fruit and woodsy. Taste has unreal with banana, pine, peppery but with a great mouthfeel and aftertaste that lingers in a good way. A bit more carbonation and aftertaste than Pliny but in a good way. I think it slightly edges out Pliny but both are amazing"
""
""
""

"Incredibly happy to taste it and find another beer that lives to its hype. Big thank you to Dark Lord goers for being great sharers."
""
""

"Pours a deep orange almost amber or brown with a frothy off white two finger head leaving supreme lacing down the glass. Smells of pineapple, tropical fruits and a little bit of caramel. Everything about this beer is fantastic so far. Strong citrus flavors hit at the front of the tongue balanced out in the middle with some caramel malt. Finishes with a light piney resin bitterness. A little bit sappy and good carbonation levels."
""
"Full-bodied, long bitter finish. Really tasty, very satisfying and delicious. Best IPA of all? Naaah…"
""
""
""
"Poured it into a tulip, glad I did even with the floaties.. It was quite tasty, I even drank the protein globs. Worth it. Would love to get a hold of another can asap.. I would drink it from the can itself on the next try. I love this beer, it deserves the 100 rating it has earned."

"I know nothing of reviews. All I know is that I heard about this beer a month ago. I live in NY and decided to take a road trip to get some at 4+ hours away. To find out they were sold out. Sold out. What brewery sells out? One that has great beer! Had a sample, it was good, went home. Returned a month later, bought a couple of cases, sent some to friends, all are happy. I've tried from both can and glass. From the can, it has a bit sharper taste/feel. What I didnt like from the can is that you couldnt smell it as well. From the glass, a bit less carbonated, much better smell, and an excellent drink. Color? Who cares? Cloudy, very little sediment. You dont look at it, you drink it! You CANNOT have just one to make a review. Give your palette time. Have 3 or 4 (yes, its ok!!) and then review it. This beer gets better each and every time. As someone else said, its like biting into a grapefruit, and like the can says, its wave after wave of hoppyness. Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Be patient, get a 4 pack, and do an informed review. You wont be disappointed! I can't wait for my next road trip! And... they are compassionate! They are donating some beer to my tribute race to a late friend. I will never forget that. Nothing like a company with a heart and compassion and PASSION!"
""
""
""
"O - Hate being harsh on such a well reviewed beer that I had trouble acquiring, but the three of us tasting this beer at the same time were all quite disappointed in just how mediocre it was. Once you take into account the terrible appearance and odd fruitiness, it's definitely a beer that I will not look to get again."
""
""
"T: So....good... Hits you with a big hit of citrus and pine, then that fades into some bready malt. Then some resin, grapefruit pith and more pine. The mouthfeel is almost chewy, but the carbonation is perfect and keeps the flavors popping. I can feel the hop resin on my teeth after each sip. An absolute experience. Perfectly balanced and well deserving of the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best of the genre in my opinion. This will certainly be my go-to on a hot day sitting on the deck. I really wanted to dislike it, because its a 6-hour round trip to the cannery, but alas I will be making some return visits."
"O - A beer that I want again soon! Incredible beer that has yet to be duplicated or overtaken. If you are any type of hophead, get yourself at can!"
""
""

"Bravo!"

The beer is super hoppy and only comes in a can. The second you enter its brewery, you can just smell HOPS! This is the best double IPA I've ever had."
""
"O- My palate does not get why this is rated so high, not that I am right or anyone else is wrong, I just don't get the high average score."
"Overall - I wasn't sure about this beer in the glass, but after drinking it out of the can, I can honestly say that it is the best overall IPA that I have ever had, and I have had quite a few. I understand the hype now, and it is well deserved."

Well, this destroyed any mark I could have imagined for myself. Truly an amazing beverage and one of the best tasting anythings I've ever had."

""

"I will agree with what's been said - this isn't the prettiest beer. But of the reviewing categories, it's certainly the least important factor to me.

"The first words I heard about this from a cicerone buddy was """please, don't drink it from the can like they say.""" So, I poured 80% into a glass and left the rest in the can. After it hit the glass, I understood the desire for the can. The unfiltered, resin-floating view was less than flattering. But, I figured, two million people can't all be wrong. So I took a whiff, and enjoyed the crisp, apricot notes coming back at me. Nothing piney, no citrus, just clean. Next was where the rubber meets the road - the taste. My wife summed it up best, when she said """wow, an IPA I wouldn't have to pair with food to drink!""" I absolutely agree. It's perfectly brewed, and is surely the best, most balanced IPA I've ever had. First taste threatens to turn into piney hops in your mouth, yet never does. It just slides away, leaving you with a tasty, refreshing treat that doesn't stay past its welcome. Now I know why this is such a revered brew, and why people love to have more than one at a time. It's just that inviting, and one I wish was closer to me in availability."

"Mouthfeel: Medium body with an exceptional drinkability. Never comes across as too bitter. Carbonation is soft though perfect for what this beer needs. Glad & thankful I finally got an opportunity to try this one. Something I would look forward to drinking for years to come."

""
"O - Man, what a beer. I love my D/IIPA's and this is the best I've had. It certainly had a lot of floaties, but that didn't bother me, but I can see how it might be off putting to people. I got this in a trade and I'm glad that I have 2 left, but I would love to taste this on tap. Amazing beer, one you must try. I can see why it is numero uno."

"I'm giving it a 4 for appearance because I prefer to drink from glasses, which i'm discouraged from doing."
""
""
""
"O: This beer lived up to the hype in that it blew my mind. It reminded me of the first time I had a sip of beer when I was about 10 yrs old, except that I liked it. As an avid IPA fan, I've been around the block the a few times and this was like the first time I had an IPA. Literally have tasted nothing like it before. However, my goodness, this beer made me full and bloated. Anything but drinkable. I got through the can just fine, but I did not want another. Also, the appearance of the beer in my glass is one of the worst I have seen. Even a shaken up belgium beer isn't this bad. Not sure if that's necessary to achieve the hop profile or not, but seems a bit sloppy to me. Def worth checking out and a fantastic world class brew, one like I have never experienced before. Big thanks to SanFranJake for hooking me up with 4 cans."

"Overall - This is the most deserving hype beer I've ever had, and hands down my favorite IIPA and beer. If I had access to this, this would be my go to beer. I cannot praise this beer anymore, the orgasmic aroma, perfectly balanced taste, and amazing mouthfeel make this way to easily drinkable for 8% abv. As I end this review, I have already finished this pint in a can. Wow! Looks like the wife and I are going to need to plan a trip to the east coast and hit up the cannery. You should seek this beer out at all costs."

"Overall, this falls just short of the aforementioned brews for me. However, it does edge out Pliny in my book. I get the hype and I love its [relative] accessibility. It's always a treat to drink this, and I plan to have some in my fridge as long as it's being brewed!"

"I was hoping to find the Holy Grail of beers but it wasn't quite there. Doing as they say and drinking it from the can, you can't really gauge the appearance.

"I can't report much on appearance because I tried this as directed - from the can. Nose was citrus - grapefruit, mango and pineapple along with some pine, grassiness and floral elements. Taste followed with big citrus flavors, especially grapefruit and orange, but with a biscuity, caramel malt for balance. Bitterness was there but not overwhelming. It predominates in the aftertaste as well, along with pine oil and honey. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. There is little to no alcohol burn. I can understand why so many people love this beer…it was great…just not my all-time favorite, as it is for so many."

I constantly waver when it comes to my favorites, but this is definitely one of them. If you like hoppy beer and have the opportunity to try Heady, do it. You will not be let down, as it is one of the best examples of its style in existence, in my humble opinion."

"O: If you can drink this beer, absolutely do so. It's maybe the best IPA I've ever had (though the first batch of Mikkeller's Invasion IPA could give it a run for its money). Not as fruity as perhaps I'd like, but it avoids any 'off' quality that hugely popular (D)IPAs (e.g., Pliny the Younger) seem to share."

Smell out of the can was amazing couldn't believe this was a can, poured a bit, sunshine orange you expect from a unfiltered ipa not that dark. First sip begs another. Holy Moly this was good . Was expecting a letdown after the hype nope outstanding. Big citrus up front, wow second sip brought the earthiness pine grass, not nearly as big of a hop blast as expected. Was very impressed. I like unfiltered beer, my stomach not so much. But wow just wow"

"Overall: Really happy to have found this. When I think of the best IPAs I have had, I think of Pliny, Hill Farmstand's Double Galaxy, and Mama Masala. I personally would choose any of those over this one as my favorite IPA. That said, the shear raw hoppiness of this one merits that it is in the discussion of the best. This one is a delightfully hoppy beer, but not one that kills you with high intensity, more like a gradual roll up of juicy flavors. I appreciate the complexity and quality flavor without the excessive bitterness. I would get this again if I can find it. Well worth the hype."

I would 100% purchase a case of this beer. In fact, I will probably now make that trip north this month if possible. I mean, what a fantastic beer. I wanted to hate it because no one likes the hype train, but this beer has earned its stripes in my opinion. Highly recommended...thank you again to monitorpop for the chance to review this beer!!"

"not sure what all the hype is about. A really good beer but not even in my top 10 of imp ipas let alone top overall. Seemed like a good one dimensional hop bomb. I tried a Hop Henge from Deschutes in the same night and i have to say I was more impressed with that beer then heady."
""
"It was light to medium bodied with a nice not overly hoppy aftertaste. This hoppy aftertaste doesn't linger. You won't need a gallon of water to get rid of the hoppy taste in the back of your mouth. Despite being an 8% ABV Imperial IPA, this is a highly drinkable beer. It also helps that it comes in a can and it's a year round beer and not a once in a blue moon type of beer that you need to trade your first born for. Would I drink it again? I would if I could find a steady supply of it. I have to thank my good friend Vince for hooking me up with this treat."

"- Overall this is an outstanding beer, and one of the best representations of the style! Just be sure to drink it within ~2-3 weeks of canning."
"O - Great double IPA, which is my favorite type of beer. First east coast IIPA that meets its hype. I guess I'm more of a fan of the west cost IIPAs. It is different from the bigger pure hop bombs, and I would say have more character. Not sure that its tops, but its probably in my top 3 that would take turns with each other."

"Props to my brother in law for snagging this for me. I've now had Pliny, Heady	 and Hoslam in one winter. Anyway, this stuff looks hazy, smells dank and piney. Tastes bitter pine and I'm not sure what else. Great stuff. Wish I could get it all the time."

"Easily in my top 5 Imperial IPA's out there- wonderful aroma every time I pop the can piney and fruity in nature. Taste matches the smell- piney undertones and strong citrus overtones- I generally pick up on grapefruit, pineapple, orange and tangerine.Just the right amount of malty goodness makes this heady retardedly drinkable. If you can get your hands on this brew do so without a second guess- no chance you will ever regret it!"
""
"O: a good DIPA, but the best, #1 ranked beer on the site? I don't agree. I've had too many great DIPAs and IPAs to jump onboard here (*ducks the hurled vegetables and garbage*). I'd say its a good buy, a MUST try, but nothing to lose sleep over if its not available in your area."

""
"Drink it from the can...yup, follow the directions printed on the top of the can. The hops are incredible, spicy and super floral. There is plenty of malt to back up the massive amount of hops and it keeps the beer in balance. No question, this certainly ranks up there on the list of greatest beers ever enjoyed. If you are ever in the area of Northern VT and have a chance to pick some up, don't think, just buy it!"

"Overall, this beer is the truth! What can I say? This is dank, hoppy, awesomeness in a can! I now understand why this is currently ranked #1 in the world in all style categories. Take Pliny The Elder as good as it is and kick it up a notch & you have Heady Topper. The only reason it is not possible for this beer to attain a perfect score is due to the fact that it is by far the ugliest DIPA one will ever encounter. However, the ugliness grows on you and it works. Not only does the brew taste like all of the flavors that could possibly be extracted from a hop flower, but it is brewed so well that there is not very much bitterness at all. Crazy stuff!"
"..apparently my review wasn't long enough, so I have to continue writing lol"
"update: this fades fast for being in a can-the little floaties get bigger and darker. the fresh hops quickly turn to the overripe fruit/banana thing. still good but a different animal after a few weeks."

"Overall... Superb. What a DIPA should be... But with a more interesting and unique hop character than most. Shit, give it a quick filter to clean up the appearance, and you've easily got one of the absolute best DIPAs brewed now."

"There are several things that make me proud to be from Vermont. This is one of them. This is a hoppy beer, but not one that makes you choke. John Kimmich, the brewer, has somehow taken an extremely hoppy beer and made it so palatable that even people who don't typically like IPA's can enjoy it. I miss the Alchemist of old (Wild Child, Holy Cow, Ouroboros, etc) and hope that Kimmich decides to can those in the future. You can't go wrong with the Alchemist."
"A very good Double IPA. My only regret is not drinking this fresher."
"Also I might add drink it from the can. the glass or plastic cup( as we were forced to drink from around the hottub at the resort in VT) is a huge mistake the flavors are lost imeadiatly and it was depressing! Drink it up, if you can get it!"

"O: a religious experience. I keep coming back for another palate wrecking sip of wave after wave of citrus and forest hop flavors."
"The taste is so incredibly interesting that I truly can't articulate what I found. No citrus, just pure hop flavor. No complexities, per se, but the hops flavors are diverse within themselves. It's as if you taste each and every hop variety yet its perfectly blended. If my palate were talented enough I believe I could name each hop variety this is so distinct. This is a truly special IPA!"

"O: Currently ranked the #1 beer in the world and I can not disagree. There are a few beers that I would consider perfect, and this is one of those. Perfect example of a delicious DIPA."

"Guuuhh. Well all you people certainly weren't kidding. Heady Topper is a delicious fucking beer and if I was in Vermont, it's probably all I would drink. How does it compare to my other favorite hop monsters, like Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, or DRIPA? Well, it'd be hard to say whether I like HT """better""" than any of them, because despite being a Double IPA, it is still vastly discernible from the rest. Nevertheless, the acclaim Heady Topper receives is deserved - this beer is fantastic. A true hop-head's wet dream. Next time, I will drink from the can."
""
"Pours a murky, pale, wheat golden color with a cottony, stubborn white head. Flecks of barley and vegetable matter float all around the beer. Juicy grapefruit with some pine on the nose. ONce the beer settles, sweeter fruit breaks through. Grapefruit up front then grass and pine emerge. But, the flavor suddenly falls of a cliff for an abrupt finish. Alcohol and unami get picked up right away and pervade throughout. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. It dries a little toward the finish. Pretty big disappointment. Pliny, Abrasive, Sucks, all way superior in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Why…Why God? Why must The Alchemist be based in Vermont and have an extremely small distribution range? The drinkability and refreshment paired with the brilliant hop profile and clean, sweet malt bill make this the stuff a hophead’s dreams are made of. The necessity to continue drinking to keep the taste in my mouth makes this akin to meth. This is beer meth. Get addicted. 19.5/20"

"I'm always interested in seeing if the beer lives up to the hype when it comes to """whales""" like Heady. In this case, Alchemist deserves all the praise it gets. Enjoy By DIPA by Stone has just been replaced. Beautiful hop bouquet, great looking and even better tasting. Amazing hop depth with just the right amount of bitterness (which is quite low for a DIPA). Alchemist really needs to start distributing outside of VT! Best beer in the whole world? Not sure about that, but best DIPA and one of the best beers I've ever had? Indeed. So glad I have 4 more of these."

"O. I love deadnaught. I love Pliny. I don't think either are this good. This is easily one of the best beers ever made and without a doubt proof canned beer works. Seek this one out, even if a weird guy at a bar asks you go behind the bar for a surprise....maybe it'll be Heady-Topper, it was for me!"
"Poured into a pint glass and a nice fluffy head developed which lasted through the drink. Aroma was very hoppy with flower and citris notes. Appearance was a cloudy straw color with nice sediment chunks. Tast was super hoppy with strong flower and hop notes with grain on the back. Mouthfeel was light but with a hint of creamyness. Aftertaste was dry and bitter on the end."

Just like many others, I have tried this poured in a few different glasses but prefer it out of the can."

""
"I had this in a glass at lunch and in the can for dinner. Since the brewer recommends drinking directly from the can, that's how I'll rate it....although I will say it's coppery and cloudy in the glass. First off, the aroma is BRILLIANT. This is an awesomely hoppy-smelling beer with notes of candy and tropical fruit (maybe even peach?). The first thing I tasted was the roasty, nutty malts followed by a bitter punch in the mouth! The finish is fruity, falling somewhere between papaya and peach. What I found most surprising was the creamy, soft mouthfeel. This is to date the best beer I've ever had. It's well worth the hype and the drive to VT (since you can't get it anywhere else)."
""
""
""
""
"Very few brews make bring a shit eating grin to my face - wow this is good! Starts with a hazy belgian blond hue with a slight finger of creamy white cap that quickly dissipates leaving just a few small islands of foam. Nose brings bright juicy citrus (mandarin, grapefruit) pineapple, slight floral pine, very juice and a hoppy earthiness. This beer reminds me alot of Nelson - big tropical notes and juicy with pine dankiness play a small secondary roll. The taste brings bitter papaya, lime rind, light caramel malts and some pine needle covered forest floor - as it warms almost an herbal, minty licorice note comes out. The mouthfeel is creamy and lush but is quickly balanced by a strong hop bitterness. Best beer not sure about that but at least top 3 ipa's i have ever had and well worth trading for."

"O: What can I say that hasn't already been said before. Best IIPA ever? I haven't tried all the other ones. Best one I've tried so far? definitely. Drink-ability for this amount of hops is outstanding. Hard to get to all the hop flavours in such a complicated hopped beer, but that is ok, this isn't about sipping an Imperial Stout till you get to the bottom of the complexity.... the Alchemist set out to make a perfectly hoppy, drinkable IPA and have surely succeeded where many others fail. For a IIPA this is near perfection. I don't go back to a lot of beers but I would drink this often if I lived in VT..."
"O: This is absolutely in the top three IPAs for me. I am about to retry some Pliney here in a couple of days and once I do that I think I will be able to place it. If you like IPAs then this is a must have beer that is worth seeking out."
""
"Ah yes, Heady Ticker...Thanks @blackie for the CANS. I'm sorry folks, but I just couldn't get myself to drink this from a can, despite their wishes. That just doesn't make any sense to me - drank from some nice glassware with no issues! If they had told you to drink it out of a shoe, would you? Bright hop profile - oily, fragrant citrus, tropical, tangerine, pineapple. Really liked this - deserves most of the praise it receives."
""
""
"I first poured a few OZ off to get a look then drank the rest from the can. Pours a hazy amber/straw in color with a pretty standard white head and pretty good lacing, points for the cool can as well. The smell fills the room even from the can resiny, piney, and citrus hops with tropical notes, pretty much any hop smell you can think of rolled into one. Taste of pure hop juice for me, not overly bitter but the can describes it best """wave after wave of hop goodness", there are also some malts in there if you try really hard to notice them. The mouthfeel is not all that heavy, the 8% abv is not noticeable at all and if you have access to this one it can be drank can after can. This can was exactly 1 week old."

"O - Picking up 2 cases of this was the best investment ever. One of the best IPAs i have ever had and im sure it will be for a while. Drink it fresh!!! This one degrades FAST and tastes better than most also when its a couple weeks old. DRINK IT FROM THE CAN!!!"

"Overall: Wow. The hype is real. This can got delivered to the store and I am drinking it only 5 days later. I hope my friends in VT will continue to ship this out to me ocassionally because I am addicted!"

"Thank you so much Kurtis!"
"O: There are many beers that could have the same looking review, but very few like Heady Topper. All of the parts do not equal the whole here. For a DIPA, I could drink these all night and that is a good, but scary thing. It is simply one of the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
"All in all, if you are a IPA/DIPA fan, and you do not enjoy this brew, you may want to look into your past... remember that licking a cheese grater moment as a kid, dont you!?!"
""
""
""
""
"Smells so good I want to crawl in the can. Hoppy yet smooth and citrusy. Truly an experience for the DIPA style. I can see why this beer consistently ly gets high reviews. It's a shame it's so difficult to get. This seems to be only avilable in central VT and not the parts of VT that border NY. Bummer...hopefully they will get better distrbution."
"Simply my favorite beer, hands down. I love the nose on this beer; the grapefruit and other citrus notes are a pleasure. Depending on the time of year and what batch you get, the flavor varies, but it's always delicious. Heck, my only complaint is that it is difficult to acquire down here in the deep south."
""
""
"Poured one in a glass and had another out of the can. It's a pale golden color. Smells of serious oranges, grapefruit, grass, mint, pine. Sweet smelling yet means business. Big hop flavors of deep citrus with sour rind, big gulp of grass, mint, pine, grapefruit towards the finish, strong clean bitterness, booze and sweetness mingle for a vodka-feel and cheddar cheese afterthought. Heavy body with medium carbonation, prickly. Very clean and big on the palate and belly."
""
""
"Overall: A beer that belongs in the top tier of DIPAs and IPAs. Very well-balanced and that smell....just incredible. The Alchemist does a great job with this brew and I highly recommend it to hop-lovers everywhere."
""
"I'm happy to say that this beer did indeed live up the the hype that surrounds it! It's huge tropical, fruity character and smooth creamy finish is in my opinion what gives it the edge over it's competitors. Hopefully Alchemist will expand it's production line so more people can experience the deliciousness of Heady Topper!"

"I liked this beer a lot and would buy it if available locally... Would I trade for it again? I'm not so sure about that... It was good but just not world class level... at least to me..."

"Thanks go to my cousin Jeff for picking this up for me from the cannery. Even though it says to drink it from the can, I prefer it from the glass. The first thing you notice as you pop the top is the wonderful aroma, ton of oranges, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. It pours a deep orange, moderate white head, big chunky floaters. The flavor is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, bitter pine. IMO the hoppiest beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The body is medium, some noticeable booze, decent carbonation. Great DIPA, pretty much lives up to hype."
""
"Great drink ability is the lovely conclusion to a great tasting and fragrant beer. I feel this beer will make true believers out of anyone fortunate to drink it. I'm usually a stout guy, I love the malt, the semi-sweetness with coffee and chocolate flavors, the thick hearty nature of it's character and yet I find myself thinking this beer is easily in my top three beers ever. It's drinkable, it's drinkable now, later and between, in any pocket of the multiverse and moment in the time continuum; but i'd drink it now... what are you waiting for?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the standard for me in comparing other beers. This is my DIPA benchmark and very few beers come close to this with the exception of IPAS from HF. Easily the best beer made to date and can't wait for it to become more accessable in the coming years."
"O: A very tasty, smooth and bitter hop bomb wrapped in the juicy, malted arms of an extremely well-crafted, 8% ABV DIPA. Heady-Topper is that beer you lust after when you want to satiate your desire for complex hop acidity but don't want rubber-tongue the rest of the night. That's not to say the hops won't burn you, because they will. It's just that this beer offers so much more and balances things well with light, delicate, yet effective, usage of malts. Won't you come to Waterbury, CT, Alchemist?"
""
""
"Well I am following the instructions and drinking this one from the can. I did previously have one poured into a glass.... which the apperance is hazy gold with hop leaves floating around and white sticky head. Sicne I'm reviewing this from the can, I will be generous with appearance since the can has a pretty cool look. The aroma is bright and citrusy with loads of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The aroma emanates freely from the mouth opening which gives me a nice bit of aroma (which I was expecting to be restrained from the can). The taste is delicious... the hops all come together and features a nice fruity/citrus profile. Notes of mango, apricot, and grapefruit come through with minimal bitterness. A touch of cream even comes through which really unifies the flavors. Almost no bitterness on the finish. The 8% ABV is dangerously undetectable. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonation which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a delicious IPA. I recently had a less than fresh can...and I must say the fresh can really shines and pops with flavor. Well worth seeking out."

"O - top shelf DIPA, easily one of the best I've ever had; really well-balanced; not too bitter; perfect!"
"Overall, this is an excellent beer that cures your hop fix (which could come back at any time between a couple minutes and a couple months). So smooth and delicious."
""
""
"O: Fantastic DIPA. The appearance brings this one down a bit. It's an amazing beer in every other aspect."
""
""
""
"Just amazing, neck and neck with Pliny as far as DIPAs go. A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a unique IPA. The beginning of this thing's taste is what sets it apart from the rest for me. It starts off with that unique flavor, then finishes with it gently, and fades out nicely. Give credit to The Alchemist for producing a unique brew that leans toward the heavy side but is definitely drinkable. Good stuff."
"O: LIke I said I love this beer, I don't know what I will do if/when I leave VT it really is that good it makes my day every time I pick it up and never lets me down I can't recommend it enough. Get it if you like ipa's it is the top of the mountain."
""

"O- Certainly one of the best IIPAs out there. Surprisingly different from Pliny and Hopslam in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – Excellent Double IPA. A slight step above Pliny The Elder and Alpine’s Pure Hoppiness for me."
""
""
"O - There is the magic that is heady topper, but there is also the facts. The facts are that even if you want to be hater you cannot. It is a very balanced, hoppy and smooth IPA. It is hard to imagine that this is the best beer I will ever taste, but it is harder yet to imagine a beer being superior. Don't kill your first born, but don't stop trying to find it."
""
""
""
"This it it! Years of tasting beers and I've found my favorite (thus far). Everything about this beer suits my palate perfectly. Arena, bitterness, yeast character are all flawless. Its unique yeast, plentiful hops, and generous bittering are perfect."
""
""
""
"This thing is a hop monster. A top two DIPA for me. Will definitely be seeking this out again in the future."
""
""
""
"This is, hands down, the best double IPA I've tasted. The hops explodes out of the can when you open it, literally filling the room with the smell. Great coloration, and the remains that come out of the can at the end add even more flavor. The aftertaste is not bitter at all, and leaves a very nice, non bitter flavor. Drinking it out of the can is definitely the best way to drink, though out of the tap is certainly right up there (Proabition Pig in Waterbury Vermont)Visiting Vt is a great thing right now for Beer lovers. Hill Farmstead and Lawsons are also right up there with their double IPA's as well. But neither can keep up with Heady..."

""

"Went to the brewery to get this one, only to find they had sold out. Luckily a local pub had it on tap and all the travelling was well worth it. Appearance wise it is cloudy with a grainy foamy head. Not overly pretty but i know this is meant to be drunk straight out of a can, so i wont hold that against them. Hops hit the nose straight away in a big american way, citrusy, piney, tropical, but underneath it all is a reasuring earthy malt base. Tastes a lot like it smells. A bunch of wonderful things coming together in a way that isnt completely cohesive, but complimentary enough that you can enjoy everything together or pick out the various delicious elements, like a farmers market salad. Really, really like this. its got a nice oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation and finishes clean and moreish. taste well rounded, complete, refreshing a little raw, but in a surprisingly endearing way. Would drink a lot of these, but i dont live in Vermont so i can't."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - very very good. I hope everyone has a chance to try this beer."
""
""
"O- This beer is not sold in NJ, nothing's perfect!"
"Arguebly the best DIPA out right now. Even if I had ready access to this beer I am not sure I would want to drink more than one can at a sitting. But I would love to have more than one can a year of this great beer."
""
""
""
"Pours hazy gold into a Sam glass. Bright white head with excellent retention recedes to coat surface. Tropical fruit and grapefruit aromas. Full with sweet tropical fruit upfront turning to full resin and grapefruit in the lasting finish. Truly a wonderful ale from a great up and coming brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally, I got my hands on this. Here we go. I'm going to drink from the can, as instructed on the can, but I will pour a bit so I can comment on the appearance. Aromas on popping the can are strong and abundant. Beautifully balanced oregano-spiced hops roll out, with a strong resiny background and malty sweet backbone. Smells amazing. I poured about a half a tumbler so I could see any head formation, and boy is there. The beer is a slightly hazed, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that is an inch and a half and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Flavors are roasted in the backbone, with a rich, resiny, bitter hops presence that just overflows the palate. The hops spicing is more subtle than the nose was, which works out very well in the total package. Citrus characters roll out across the palate the more you drink, with an undertone of grapefruit tart and bitterness. Delicious. Wet hops flavors are abundant from the initial taste across the board into the aftertaste. Rich, full bodied, and extremely smooth, which supports all of the flavor profiles. The finish is bitter and slightly drying, with a clean overall feel. This beer is fantastic. The more you drink, the more layers of hops flavor reveal themselves. Amazing. This is a tremendous brew!"
""
"O: Honestly, this beer meets all the hype. There are a lot of rarities out there that are really sought after that do not live up to their hype. This beer absolutely does. Easily the best DIPA out there that I have tried (I haven't had younger)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel I found a bit flat; I guess some people like that, but I prefer lively carbonation and I think this would benefit from that--again, a preference thing. Overall I'm blessed to have had the #2 IPA on here and feel it's worth the hype. Bell's Hopslam is very similar to this and is another excellent beer that will suffice quite nicely til The Alchemist and I again cross paths."
"16 ounce pint can thanks to youbrewidrink, appreciate it man! Pour is bright orange with a lot of haze, some floaties, and a lot of lacing. Smell is fruity hops, some pine, smells good. Flavor is bitter, tropical fruits, definitely a good DIPA. If I didn't know better I'd guess this was a west coast IPA. I can see why this is so highly rated and I'd love to get a four pack but I know it isn't easy."
""
""
""
"Looks like dirty sewer water dumped into a light beer, smaller off white head. Aroma is tropical fruit, marijuana, onions. Similar flavor, lots of onions, garlic, tomato, juicy fruit, papaya, and orange. Bitter finish, pretty dry for the ABV. Reminds me exactly of what Toppling Goliath is doing around here."
""
"O: 5"
""
""
""
"O - Definitely recommend this beer if you can get it. Definitely recommend driving to get this beer if needed. I enjoyed it. I didnt mind the fact that deliciousness was floating in the beer when poured out of the can, probably why the recommend drinking from the can. Awesome stuff either way."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Surely topped off my day!"
""
"O - Finally, I made it to Central VT to pick up a few 4packs. It met all of the hype. No idea what it looks like but I dont care, based off of everything else this beer is perfect so its getting a 5. I have a feeling if I poured this into a can there would be a lot of hop reminents mixed in. Raw flavorful hops"
""
""
"Overall this is one of the best beers I've had. Pliny the Elder was somewhat of a disappointment to me so East Coast wins this round. IMO that doesn't happen often in the hop realm."
""
"Mouthfeel is of course resiny."
"Overall - Incredible. Lives up to the hype. And absolutely delicious beer. An experience every beer drinker needs to have."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well i would say this is the best DIPA i have had, and i have had a lot of the top competitors offerings of this style. I was most blown away by the Citra hop presence, balance perfection, and drinkability. This is a must have!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heady Topper really lived up to the hype and I would advise any beer lover within driving distance to make the trip- you wont regret it!!!"
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer many, many times..On tap at the PIG is the best place to drink it. Also, had it straight up out of the can. And, even went against the grain and poured the can into a glass pint. This beer is so god i would recommend taking a bath in it. Tons of hop after hop his your noise from the get go. Beautiful gold color, with a creamy head that laces perfectly to the glass and your face! Mild bitter, Erich is explained on the can. 8% abv so clearly, this one can get ahead of you. Very balanced malt to bittering, creating a nice full creamy body. I live about 3hrs away from the Alchemist cannery, and do travel up there often, if, you're looking to trade, drop me you're request."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A fantastic DIPA. One that if available locally, would become my go to beer. Unfortunately Vermont is not near enough and my penchant for wanting to try new beers, makes me trade half of what I bring back each trip."
"O: Favorite beer I've ever had. Give me this over any other DIPA, Pliny eat your heart out."
""
""
"O: well, this one most definitely lives up to the hype. I would love to try this side by side against PtE, Zombie Dust and Hopslam to see how they each compare to each other. But overall, I find this one just simply awesome. The big tropical fruits are very well balanced with the big piney hops aren’t overwhelming on the palate. The brew is quite refreshing and has a very high drinkability. And the bitterness that is left on the palate actually creates an urge to take another sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm a believer in the hype. This beer gives unspeakable pleasures and I would gladly trade my wife for a case. Warning: This beer will give you the urge to hunt predatory animals. You have been warned."
""
"Overall: I have no idea how old the can I reviewed the last time was, but this one blows it away, and I know it was less than a week old. Incredible stuff, lives up to the hype, and blows Pliny out of the water in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.75). A world-class beer. It is no surprise that this beer has been moving up the charts over the last year."
""
""
"O: Poured half the can into a glass for my review and drank the other half from the can as recommended on the can. This is definitely a world class DIPA, great aroma and great flavor...and it comes in a can to top it off. This beer is super easy to drink but I think it could really sneak up on you because the alcohol is very well hidden. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply put, this is a world-class IIPA. As far as I'm concerned, it's the new flagship for the style. I'm glad I got it when I did as I'm sure future releases will reach Pliny the Young levels of insanity."
""
""
""
"A true honor and a reminder to how very humbling it is to be a part of this great community. Thanks again Paul!"
""
"OK...there's no question that this is a good beer. A damn good beer. But #3 in the world? I can name 5 or 6 new imperial IPA's I've tried locally that are better crafted than this (Super IPA, The Pupil, this year's batch of summer YuleSmith to name a few). And they don't need to hide in a can. This points to a geographical bias that I've suspected of BeerAdvocate for some time...I'm sorry, but there's no way this is better than Pliny the Elder or any number of Alpine's IPA's. That being said, this shouldn't be reviewed against expectations. If I was handed this blind - say, in a keg cup so you don't see the crazy complexion - I'd be talking about it all night. It delivers on all the levels a fan of imperial IPA's expect (other than appearance). But given that this was pretty hard for me to come by I'll probably stick with more local treats."
""
"8%abv!!!! It drinks like a 5%er. Man this is smooth. So good."
"Mouthfeel: This is a tasty medium to heavy bodied beer that isn’t as easy drinking as some IIPA’s but a world class IIPA shouldn’t be able to drink like a BMC. The hops of the beer should stick around for a while."
""
""
""
"Although the can directs not pour I couldn't do that. After taking a sip or two from the can I poured out and got the full hop aroma which I have to have with an IPA. This is beer is talked up so much I feared I would be let down but even with lofty expectations this beer exceeded them. Best IPA in northeast, Hands down."
""
"If Superman was a beer drinker, he would drink Heady."
"Perhaps the pinnacle of DIPAs"
""
""
""
""
"It's probably my favorite beer right now. It's worth trading for to try at least once and any time I can I have people pick some up for me or get it myself. It's drinkable, great flavor and gives you the right buzz. If you're an IPA drinker, get some."
"Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fine champagne like bubbles fade away to a pine hop finish and lingering juicy grapefruit peal with no trace of alcohol."
""
"Overall: My first ever experience with this beer is one that is memorable to say the least. Simply an intimidating beer with the warnings on the can but in the end the beast is not as scary as you'd think. A surprisingly easy drinking DIPA that I'm delighted I got to try."
""
"I'm a contrarian, so I like to think when I say something is worth the hype, it's worth the hype. Moreover, I/IPAs aren't always my cup of tea, but this is just a fantastically brewed beer. They deserve all the praise they've gotten."
"Drank out of the can. This is about as close to DIPA perfection as you can get. I absolutely cannot believe that beer from a can could be this good. Total fresh hop fragrance hits you as you pop the top of the can. The can says """drink from the can""" but I need to pour it into a glass to appreciate the hop aroma and flavor to its fullest. really nice unfiltered murky pour with a huge off-white creamy head. The flavor is perfection: huge hop flavor with none of the bitterness. My favorite beer right now."
"O- I can never say no to a Heady"

"O- My fav-o-rit beer by far. This is my go to on a weekly basis. Being that the brewery is only 6 miles from my house, it's a no brainer on what I'm going to drink. Other then some small batch home brews by a few local VT brewers, this is the best beer I've ever had by far. Looking forward to more releases from the Alchemist in the future. I miss the wide range of Alchemist beers at the old pub."
""
""
""
""
"Note: The can review was a joke, I drank half from the can, then poured the rest into a glass to enjoy for comparison. I did find the flavors stronger when drinking form the can, it was interesting."
"medium body, nice carbonation, slightly creamy on lips. a tiny bit overhype honestly, but a damn good beer nonetheless. sweet, citrus, hoppy - that's all i really want in ipa and that's what they are offering!"
"Can shared by Mike. Thanks! Pours dark golden with off white head. Aroma is sick. And by that I mean awesome. Wet resiny sticky hops dominate the nose. Flavor follows the nose and has a great meaty malt backbone to back it up. Medium mouthfeel. This tastes amazing. Its worthy of all the praise it gets. Just awesome."
""
"2/3/13-thanks to my friend Jim for hooking me up with a 4 pack of cans...I cracked one today and it was so fresh and hoppy that this re-confirms that this is the best beer that I've ever had. Drank it from the can and the piney and floral hop flavors were so strong yet so smooth that I had to force myself to slow down so I could savor every sip."
""
"WOW! This is an exceptionally well hopped pale ale. I wish I could get it all the time. It is cloudy orange with a finger of head. Highly carbonated with a full complement of hop aromatics. Lower bitterness than I was expecting from a imperial IPA. WOW!"
"O - This is a heady DIPA for sure. Incredible fruit profile and bitterness. Taste more fruit than hops but nonetheless it was a pleasure to consume. Cant think of a much better beer to have on my birthday."

"Big thanks goes out to YaKnowBrady for sending me a few cans of this for the sole reason that I had never ticked it before! Thanks immensely my friend! Served from can into an oversized wine glass. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, fruit, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, earth, and fruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I am so excited I was finally able to try this one now that they can it. Wow! What a beer it was… It had some aspects that reminded me of Gubna, but had a huge amount of balance going on to keep your palate nice and happy so it did not succumb to a palate hop onslaught. Very well balanced and inviting after each sip. You know what… Notre Dame is playing Navy right now as I’m typing this up on my laptop, I think I will have another one of these right now straight from the can! Cheers!"

"Can shared on the bus during RBSG 2012. Pours clear gold with a sudsy white head. Huge tropical and citrus aroma, grapefruit, peach, orange peel, pineapple. Nice blend of resin, pine and acidic citrus notes in the flavor. Dry bitter finish. Great DIPA, promoting big hoppy flavors instead of malt and booze."

"O- I LOVE Heady Topper. Definitely better than Pliny. End of story"
"What can I say? This beer is amazing and, as usual, I can see why beeradvocates love it so dearly. Truth be told, it doesn't taste all that different than, say, Stone Ruination. It is just so damn perfectly dialed-in. There is no excess sweetness, a perfect balance of hop flavors, and it pushes every button on your palate. How a beer this bitter can be this drinkable is beyond me. I wish I could somehow do a head-to-head comparison between this and Pliny the Elder (it's been so long since I've had it), but living in Kentucky makes it nearly impossible to get both beers fresh at the same time. Heady Topper is probably one of the 3 or 4 most enjoyable beers I have ever had."
"O - A very good IPA. I highly recommend it."

"an affordable can at farmhouse tap in burlington. they say drink it from the can, but i poured it for more careful study. it looks lovely, hazy, definitely unfiltered. radiant hay color with thick white suds floating on top that leave some mean lacing as it drinks. smells like quite the hop bouquet. grapefruit and spruce are the most prominent hop esters im picking up, but there are many. it tastes like it smells, deep and complex, worthy of patient consumption. its fruity, in addition to citrus there is also nectarine and mandarin orange on my tongue. its got upbeat carbonation which keeps its oily medium taffy sticky body moving along. the aftertaste is long and bittersweet, as it should be. alcohol is well hidden in taste, but can certainly be felt. this is one hell of a big ipa, and i dont want to hear anymore debate about pliny/heady, because both are outstanding and distinct brews, and that should suffice for all of us."

"Only on draft in 2 places that i know of. THe cannery in Waterbury, and Prohibition Pig, the onld brewery"
"Overall (5/5): An incredible hop experience, I must say. Big, big flavors all over the place. The most serious hop head will appreciate this beer the most and likely will be in a state of hop nirvana. Non-hop heads won't know what hit them."
""
"There is an underlying sweetness to this beer that keeps it from being a straight up grapefruit bomb, but it finishes dry and it is not cloying. Extremely refreshing and nearly overwhelming with hop flavors - if there was a flavor I would want to drown in this would be it."
""
""
"O-Great beer. Has everything you are looking for in a double IPA! Only thing that its lacking is in the appearance with the minute head retention. As long as the beer smells appetizing and taste good I am happy so nothing to worry about in this beer!"

"Between the Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawson's Finest, I feel very lucky to live in VT! IPAs are my favorite style of beer, but I usually find DIPAs to be too strongly tasting of alcohol. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable despite its high alcohol content and potent hopping. The smell of the heady topper alone is delicious, and the taste is even better, with passionfruit, mango, and piney hop aromas. The heady topper delivers the ultimate hops experience!"
""
""
""
"Overall, a very fine beer. I think the hype factor drives up the ratings of this guy a little, but it's very very good. A little more boozy than I liked for the fairly low IIPA 8%abv. The appearance turned me off a bit - it's almost like the brewery knows they hit on all the other aspects and got lazy with the visuals. Glad I got to try it and will pick some up when I have the opportunity."
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable beer, past its best but still very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
"Two cans, one poured, the other straight up. Poured has a nice white head, no lacing. The smell is piney and flowery. The taste is totally raw and bitter, sweet upfront and that's the end, except for a chalky dry aftertaste. It's greasy with a good amount of fizz. Why is a beer like this necessary?"
""
""
""
"O--and out of the coolest tall boy i've ever seen."
""
"D: like the can says, dangerously drinkable. hands down top 3 DIPA's i can just pick up and enjoy several without being overwhelmed. just lovely."
"This is incredible stuff, this beer was drank mostly from the can... only poured a sample of it out to enjoy the orange yellow color of it with a nice looking white head on top. Had a nice unfiltered cloudiness to it also. The smell of the beer is very hoppy, lots of pine aromas in it with the delicate floral and citrusy notes in there as well. The taste is probably worthy of a 5.5 honestly. There is no doubt that this has some of the best transitions of flavors I've had from any IPA. There is a huge rush of floral sweet citrus notes on the tongue in the very beginning, as the liquid settles there is a very subtle burst of malts on the tongue right before the aggressive pine resin starts to claw away at your taste buds. The mouthfeel is smoothly carbonated making this beer very easy to drink, it's medium bodied and has a nice dry finish to it. Overall this is something very special, The people up at Alchemist aren't screwing around here, they are setting out to make the best IPA in the world and I would say that they just might have it. This is a beer I would drive to Vermont to get cases of. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to drinking the next 3 in the pack."

"Loved it, ranks up with the exsellant boyking batches and the pliney I had last fathers day. I need a friend in that part of the country to ship."

"Thank you."
"I was very excited to find this beer in Boston, but its hype exceeds my expectations."
"Overall, in my opinion, any beer connoisseur needs to add this beer to their beer-"""bucket list"""... ESPECIALLY for hopheads."
"I'm agnostic, but if there is a (non-Mormon) God, may he bless the Alchemist, and watch over them so they can keep making this incredible beer."
""
""
"Fantastic beer and I think my personal beer high score!!!"
""
""
"O - This is a wonderful beer, head and shoulders above any other IIPA I've had. It loses points for the can thing not really being my bag, and because the amazing flavors don't quite translate to the nose, but this is still the IIPA that beats all the others. Totally worth the hype, and worth seeking out. This beer was painstakingly crafted to not be too boozy, nor too hoppy, nor too malty, and they've absolutely nailed it. The taste is incomparable for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O- This isn't the perfect beer to me. The only issue I have with it is the fact that I can taste the alcohol prominently due to the fact that they put in less malts to balance. It would have killed if it had no alcohol trace like the Pliny but at the same time the taste and nose blows virtually all other DIPAs. But it's still damn tasty but I will stop at only drinking one per session and then focus on a more balanced IPA or DIPA such as what Hill Farmstead occurs."
"Overall, I liked this beer a lot - not sure about drinking from the can instead of pouring into a glass, however that is how the brewer recommended so who am I to argue?"
""
""
"Overall: hard to argue that Heady Topper is the best Double IPA I have ever had or will have. I've had good one's but I have to agree with my fellow beer aficianados out there...WOW!"
""

""
""
""
"My first review of a beer I choose this one, kindly sent fresh from the northeast. I preface, this offering is being tasted on an afternoon where, sometime following this review i will be trying my first Pliny TE (having arrived simultaneously).. Heady Topper: As a lover of American craft brew for 3 years and having tried, in my mind, a good deal of DIPA's (considering I didn't become a craft beer advocate until relocating to Texas oddly enough), I am more than enthusiastic about this tasting.The hop bouquet is blowing my mind, and in a well-balanced way. Expectations of this beer are met and slightly exceeded (they were phenomenal expectations prior to sampling). Pineapple/ citrusy greatness abounds. With this beer it seems as if I've never appreciated the mouthfeel of this style until now. There is no drawback here. Tasty beyond belief. Balance is impeccable, yet i need to stress how the hops flourish here... is this Simcoe and Citra? Well i dont know, that I wonder though. Anyway out of curiosity I poured a bit less than 1/4 of the can into a Chimay chalice for a visual. I really appreciate an unfiltered IPA made well (prior to this my affinity was for the now-shelved DFH Squall). Im liking the look of murky golden when I know everything else about it is sublime. The lacing with Heady is incredible, and again lacing is something I continue to appreciate but with this beer in a glass it was sticky city (and this from a beerman who spot cleans his glassware well). But yes I have to agree with the brewmastery of Alchemist where the recommendation is to drink from the can. Yes you will surely love it in glassware, but if you love true hop heaven, you will be best to press lips to aluminum."
""
"O - Look. My memory's not great, but this is one the best hoppy beers I've had. I wish I could stock my fridge all the time with it. It really approaches perfection as much as you can reasonably expect something to. It's a benchmark kind of beer."

" I am a big fan of IPA's and this double IPA does not disapoint. The taste is fantastic, at 8% you don't taste any alcohol that you would expect at a 8% ABV. The reason is the hops, you definitely taste hops, very crisp clean taste of citrus and pine, but very fresh at the back end, it doesn't have the bad sour after taste like some IPA's. I definitely do recomend you listen to the brewer and drink it out of a can, you just don't get the same experience out of a glass, which makes me wonder if I would order it at a bar, but probably I would because even out of a glass you would be getting a fantastic beer. I was skeptical about all the hype that this beer was getting, but I have to say this product definitley lives up to it. I'm never good at picking a favorite anything, but this would definitely be in my top 3, an absolute must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a perfect beer. Nothing else comes close. Was lucky enough to have side by side with Lawson's 'Double Sunshine', Hill Farmstead 'Galaxy' and 'Society #3' and Heady is better hands down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slick yet heavy feel. Lightly oily on the back end. Big bitter pop of juicy hops. Full of lush flavor of bitter fruits, semi-sweet syrup on finish. White peppery """burn""" in the midst, but this is bitter all out. Surprisingly an easy finish with such a boisterous profile. Great beer. Not my top IIPA, but by the far the best from a can."
""
"Honestly I can say this is the best beer I have had. I am a big IPA fan, and this blows them all away. Highly recommended but difficult to obtain. Sell your children if needed to obtain a case."
""
"One of the best beers to ever come out of a can and I can't wait to get my hands on some more."

"Pours from a 16 oz can, nice hazy orange color. Smell is of sweet hops. Taste is medium bodied, great balance to it. Not overly hoppy (as warned by the outside of the can) and has a great maltiness to it that most IPAs (specifically double IPAs) are missing. Delicious aftertaste.. I can see why this has such a high rating. Felt lucky to try this beer, definitely worth seeking out if you get a chance.. one of the better imperial IPAs I've gotten to try."
""
""
"I had one beer out of the can and one poured out. The poured one is very cloudy like a hefe. Put it up to your nose and it may burn your eyebrows off it's so hoppy. First sip, pungent, piney hop flavor, balanced with the sweet citrus, but also tastes creamy like a hefe, whereas a lot of IPAs taste thinner. Nice thing about this beer is that some IPAs lose their hoppiness the closer you get to the end of your glass. Not this one. As the advertising says, wave after wave of hoppiness till the finish. Very very enjoyable, if you have a free weekend and don't mind road trips, go seek this beer out. Bring some coolers to keep it cold on the ride home!"
""
"The first sip was pretty great and as I kept drinking I noticed a lot of the flavors developing. Being an 8% abv beer, I am very surprised how easy this was to drink. Their was a slight bitterness from the hops, but the aromatic hops cut right through that creating an extremely well balanced DIPA. Though the hops are definitely the star, I really appreciate the malty sweetness of this beer as well. An amazing beer and I can't wait to get another can of this ale."
""
""
""
""
"This is where I fully understood why they want you to drink it from the can. The first sip delivers what you get in the nose, an amazing burst of fresh, citrus hops with wonderful floral notes. The biscuit continues to act as a great balance and the bitterness you'd expect never exerts its dominance. This is truly an extremely drinkable IPA. How they deliver the aroma and the flavors of the hops as successfully as they do without ratcheting the IBUs into the stratosphere is incredible. I'd love to see more IPAs built on this blueprint. Don't get me wrong; every now and then I want something that will destroy my palate, but I know that I can only drink one or two of them and then not much of anything else. With Heady Topper I imagine I could finish can after can...all day long."
""
"Despite the """directions""" I've been conditioned to only drink BMC out of the can. Dark orange-yellow in color, looks like dirty orange juice, and murky. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a sturdy white cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass.. Pungent citrus pineapple aroma with solid sweet, sticky malt and orange beneath and just the slightest hint of booze. The aroma almost has a feel to it. Like hop resin and dust in the sinuses. Amazing. Thick and chewy feel with dense, rich carbonation that lazily rolls through. Pungent citrus hop flavor from start to finish that are propped up by a strong sweet malty backbone.. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness with a touch of citrus bitterness and booze."
""

""
"I just opened my first ever Heady Topper. In the words of the great Homer Simpson """Jebus, Buddha, I love you alll.""" This is different than anything I have had before. Nothing relates to it. I have had Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, and a number of other amazing beers. I am not sure I am saying its the best beer I have ever had, but its in the discussion and its definitely unique. I am drinking it straight from the can as the rim of the can says to do. Its extremely bitter to in the begining but citrus in the end. Do whatever it takes to get your hands on this (outside of taking one of my glorious new friends from my fridge)."
"Thanks to Kevin for the gift, I'll be sure to return the favor!"
""
""
"Overall, fantastic beer that completely lives up to the hype and well deserving of my first review. Hope I didn’t let it down."
""
""
"I really can't say enough about this beer...It's all that and more! Get a can NOW!"
""
""
"P.S. - after a few good sips from the can, I poured the rest into an imperial pint glass. Very hazy golden yellow color and thick white head that settles to a rocky top with great lace. Nothing much lost by pouring it into a glass but there's something a little rebellious about drinking one of the world's best beers straight from the tall boy!"
""
"This is the shiznit. Been drinking and home brewing for years. DIPA's are my thing and this is amazing. Best beer on the east coast IMHO and probably the best beer I've had. I lived on the west coast 15 years ago but haven't had the west coast stuff fresh in years but this stuff is amazing. $4 for a can is a steal. Planning another trip to VT just to stock up. I ruined myself."
""
""
""
""
"Get it if you can."
""
""
"Overall: Heady Topper certainly lives up to the reputation! This is a phenomenal IIPA that (unlikely as it seems) DOES taste better out of the can than out of a glass! Initially the difference between can and glass is quite small, however as the beer warms the can certainly comes out on top!"
""
""
""
"O - Rough around the edges in all the right ways. The type of beer that grows on you and leaves you wanting more when the last one is gone. Worth the hype in my opinion, and something I'll seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one heck of a DIPA that I wish was available locally as you could drink one after another. It is well balanced and brings a ton of hoppy flavors without being bitter or overpowering. Definitely one of the best DIPAs out there."
"O-perfect. I'm so sad its gone. Better than any big IPA Ive ever had"
""
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 01-09-2012)"
""
"O - I think this is easily my favorite beer in a can and among the best ever. I like this as much as Pliny the Younger. Where that beer was complex, rich, and subtle at the same time, this beer just does one thing, but does it PERFECTLY. It captures the soul of the hops."
""
"O - excellent. Almost everything I love about IPAs in a single can. Alchemist really hit the nail on the head with this one."
""
"Overall: Wow what just happened, this beer is so good its disorienting! This im my favorite hoppy beer I have ever drank! This is my new favorite DIPA! Added bonus...its in a can the best beer vessel that there is with added convience factor of not needing a bottle opener to get into this nectar! Bravo Alchemist! I am moving to VERMONT!"
"Hey, dig this, hep cats, this is what'll send you (and I don't mean via FedEx, in fact, the less the feds are involved, the better). Stamp help out. Lenny Bruce is not afraid. I am now going to operate a heavy crane near an orphanage. That, or procure a tank and drive that around. It all makes sense now. Say, who left murph the surf on my ceiling?"
"1pt Can. A drop into a ½ glass –just for appearance & smelling- the rest direct from the can following brewer´s suggestion. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pale straw color, hazy. Off-white, small bubbled, froth. Slowly dissipated crown leaves a thin foam layer on top. Intense ripe tropical fruit, resin & sweet malt aromas. Pleasant sweet, creamy, maltiness at fist sip mixed with tropical fruits & increasing bitterness. Medium to full body, oily texture. Low carbonation. Ripe fruit in the middle cut by resiny touch lingers into the short, dry finish. Delightful. Probably one of the best AIPA I´ve ever had."
""
"On the can it says that you should drink from the can to keep all of the hops aroma and flavor in the can. Of course, I had to pour a little into a glass to see what it smelled like. It had a very hoppy but fruity smell. Very aromatic like a good IPA should be. Drinking it from the glass made for a good hoppy IPA. Drinking this beer from the can made for a completely different beer. Much more of the hop character seemed to stay with the can and as for drinkability.... It was almost unfair. This is easily the most drinkable IPA I have ever had. Incredibly smooth and fresh with hints of hop """bite""" that won't overwhelm. The one characteristic that supercedes all others is easily the drinkability of this beer. I have yet to try PtE or PtY but this goes down easily as the best IPA I have ever tried."
""
"O: Really impressive. Indeed the best IPA I've tried, not cause it's the boldest, but because it's elegant in its own way. Nice one..."
""
""
"I could go on but many others have done it already with some very elaborate and detailed descriptions."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer but it's a little green around the edges particularly when drank from a glass. It's a taste bomb from a can. Enjoyed it very much."
"This stuff is crack for hopheads. extremely hoppy, no hype or marketing, just a very raw and concentrated hop flavor. I highly recommend this to the discerning hophead. I'd say it might be a bit much for anyone but."
""
"It's one of those beers that everyone should drink at least once!"

"Yummy."
"buy this beer! buy it by the case if you can! keep this beer in your fridge all year round!"

""
"I've had a couple more cans that were even fresher (without the yeast floaties), and I have to upgrade this review. Although cloudy, it pours with a nice head. Despite the amount of hops, body is incredibly smooth. Best thing in a can?"
"O: I've always been afraid of trying whales like this sometimes, because they never seem to live up to their names. This definitely lives up to its name. I'm so happy I got a chance to try this. This is probably the best beer I've ever had."
"O - Are there more insane DIPAs out there? Of course. But this has to be one of the freshest and """purest""" tasting DIPAs I have ever had. It's near flawless and quite remarkable, and totally warrants the $12 price tag for the 4 pack. If you're a true hophead like me, you really have no choice but to seek this out. It warrants the hype and I'm hoping it will propel this brilliant brewer to future success and more releases."
""
"O-I could not find this beer's finesse, there were TONS of hop flavors but they didn't sing in symphony. I would buy it again, but I would not seek it out."
"I can't recommend this beer enough. If you are a hophead and haven't tried this one, you are missing out!"
""
"Try to get a hold of 2 or x amount cans of these and you won't be let down. Great stuff."
"Overall, I would say this beer lives up to the hype quite well. I like how dry of a finish it is, makes you keep coming back for more!"
""
""
""
"The beer is bone-dry, extremely fruity, and has a very low bitterness for the style. The result is an insanely drinkable treat of which I wish I had a keg of."
""
""
""
""
"Side Note: I never took the """drink from the can""" seriously, but it's legit. Maybe it's just mental, but it tastes better straight from the can."
""
"This is one beer I wish I could have more of. Initially when opened (straight from the fridge) it's kind of over powering in the bitterness, but some mouths in it's just so balanced and just beautiful all the way. One of the best DIPA's I've had."
""
"o- This is for Mark: Heady Topper...How do I begin to explain Heady Topper? Heady Topper is flawless. I hear a case of this stuff should be insured for $10,000. I hear Heady does car commercials...in Japan. Heady's favorite activity is knocking people senseless over the head with its awesomeness. One time, John Stamos drank Heady on a plane...and said it was pretty (unbelievable). One time, it punched in the face with its deliciousness...It was awesome."
"O: This is an amazing beer; hoppy and fruity and oily and so damn good"
"Overall. Had this side by side with my (previously) favourite dipa. I still have a great love for the other one, but this has to be the best tasting dipa I've had to date. Looks kinda' iffy, but a guy gets over that after one taste."
"The feel is smooth and goes down easier then expected from a hop forward beer. It is really drinkable and seems to want to go down without a thought. This is may be the most drinkable hop-flavorful beer I have had. Worth the wait and the travel to have this beer."
"This is my second time having this super hyped up beer. Both times I really enjoyed it. This time I am reviewing and only poured 5 ounces out of can to see appearance and get more smell than outta can...not that you can't smell the hops as soon as you crack the can. Really hazy yellowish with minimal head. Laces but not as sticky as I was anticipating, dissipates as the head did. This beer you can smell as your drinking it, rinds, grapefruit,citrus, and don't forget the hops. Different than any dipa that I ever had. Great hop pop, Med Carb,and balance that makes you want more!! Big hop aftertaste that keeps you wanting more. Overall lives up to hype and will seek out again. Hop heads dream and really really leaves hops for days in your mouth. In my top 5 just unsure until I have access to more where it falls."
""
""
""
"O: This is, by far, the best DIPA I've ever had and perhaps the best beer I've had period. PtE, Hopslam, and Dreadnaught are incredible beers but not even in the same class as Heady Topper. HT leaves them in the dust. I've had CBS on more than one occasion, and almost all Cantillon variants. I'm not exaggerating or going overboard when I say this might be the best beer on earth. A remarkable offering. Do yourself a favor and try this brew. It's worth it and then some."

""

"Overall, I can see why people go nuts over this stuff. A unique, aggressive, very satisfying drink."
""
"Light in color sort of a amber straw, nice white head and good aroma, not as much aroma as I would have expected, but good citrus and flower comes through. Also drank out of the can as suggested. The taste is nice and smooth, great drinkability. Maybe not as well balanced as others, the bitterness seems to linger with this one and I think it tends to take over the thin malt base. Great beer overall, but needs a bit better balance."
"Re-Review. Drank this beer from the Can, as stated on the Can the first time, the second time I poured it into a glass. As soon as I poured it I understood why they want you to drink from the can. The beer looks like I cloudy mess with hop particles in it. It smells like a floral hop party as soon as the can was opened. The taste followed the nose, with a very thin malt backbone, this beer was smooth and very easy to drink. It tastes so citrus-y it almost tastes like juice was added. No booze present. This is probably my Third favorite DIPA behind Kern Citra, and PtE."
""
"I've had this beer in a pint glass from the can and directly out of the can (as the label suggests). Liked it better in the glass. It is by far one of the finest beers I've ever had. Excellent pour brilliant finish. Place it up there with Pliney the Elder."
"Poured a nice coppery hue with a long lasting white head. The beer itself is cloudy with particulates all over the place. Impeccable smell. Huge gobs of pine resin and orange/grapefruit rinds all over. I don't even know if words can appropriately describe this. Pine, earth, grass, and citrus fruits battle it out on my palate amongst delicate carbonation. A healthy honey-grain malt backbone keeps everything together. Wow, quite a treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Elite class. Hoisting my empty can up high to pay homage to one of the greats. 5.0"
""
"Many thanks to woodychandler for coming through big time with this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an orange/brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with hops and citrus. Taste is also very good, hoppy, citrus and tropical fruits abound, bitter but not overly so, a well constructed beer. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall was a pleasure to drink, worth seeking out."
""
"Overall I could completely see the hype behind this beer being worth it but not worth trading away too much for it. Thanks again for the can Rick!"
""
"Overall: This beer reminds me of a great jazz band. The malt, heat, IBU, and mouthfeel are all playing wonderfully subdued parts, supporting the hop oil virtuoso soloist. DIPAs don't get much better than this."

""
""
""
""
""

"Amazing. by far my fav ipa. Drank a Pliny the elder and heady topper side by side and hands down heady topper came out on top just amazing. Once you crack the can you get an abundance of fresh grapefruit. Usally I drink straight from the can as it indicates to do. But not bad in a snifter as well. So well balanced. All I can think of when drinking this ipa is a super fresh grapefruit coated with a tad of granulated sugar. Hands down perfection."
"O - You need to seek this out right now."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy golden amber with a white head that fades quickly. There is some thin lacing, but I'm not really letting it sit long enough to cling to the sides. The nose is potent, orgasmic citrus hops with some potent ethanol. The beer drinks like a sweet hop elixer with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel that leaves a slightly lingering bitterness. Excellent beer for a reasonable price, and yes, this one is definitely worth the hype."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer isn't what I expected, but it is as good as I expected. This was incredibly refined, while also giving a solid dose of bitterness and aggression. I would really love to get my hands on more of this stuff."
""
""
"O- This has been my favorite DIPA since I tasted it and after having Pliny, Abrasive, Hopslam, Citra, and most of the other well-knowns out there, I really don't see that changing. It has an element to it that the others don't bring to the table the same way. This truly is the only IPA that I would seek out at this point, with good reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice DIPA, though not a pliny-slayer by any stretch. This can probably wasn't super fresh."
""
"Oh my, easily one of the top 3 IIPAs that I have had to date. This IIPA towers above the hype that surrounds it. This beast from the east stands tall among the ''big guns'' of the west ( specifically the offerings from Russian River and Alpine). I can only hope that the crew over at The Alchemist make these shipments of Heady Topper to NYC more often."
""
"DIVINELY DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
""
"O: Really nice beer. Worth the hype?  I guess, but I can drive 3 hours for Surly so I don't see this supplanting my needs, especially at the trading cost it now asks..."
""
"had this beer many times both from the can and poured out into a glass. I really hope I can get the chance to try this brew on tap (if they do that). I have to be honest, I love the smell you get when you pour the beer into a glass and the color is spectacular, however I like the taste better straight out of the can. I wish their was a happy medium that could be found. So poured out of the can it is a golden copper color with a nice cream colored head. The smell is floral hops and very inviting. The taste is very crisp and hoppy but not overpowering. I love how balanced this IPA is."
""
""
"O: Really good IIPA. Couldn't tell you the last time I had a beer out of a can, but I can promise you it wasn't anywhere close to this tasty! Would definitely like to have again."
"PS- Despite the instruction...No, I have never consumed from the can...Blasphemy!"
""
""
"Overall, I'd say 13 bucks is highway robbery, but this beer almost makes extortion worthwhile. I'll justify by saying this is a limited tough to find release that easily trounces a bomber of other DIPAs at the same price. I won't pay that again, I'll trade instead. But I love canned beer and I had to try this one. It lives up to the hype."
""
"This is really an amazing beer. I am generally not into double IPA because they usually substitute taste for strength of content. However, I bought a 4 pack of this from Waterbury VT, and I loved it more each time I had it. The hops are incredible, the flavor is ... well try it. Its worth the three bucks that it costs."
""
"Overall, this is how you make a World-Class Double IPA. It deserves all of its hype. I'm going to travel all the way to Vermont just to pick up a case this summer. I declare this Summer of Heady Topper!"

"O- One of the best DIPA's I've had, insane drinkability, this definitely lives up to the hype for me, I've always been a huge Pliny fan, but this is just as good (not getting into that argument). This is the kind of beer I would drink every day forever if I could."
""
"O: A really, really nice IPA. Definitely enjoy these higher-powered IPAs!!"
""
""
""
""
"Heady topper is ridiculously cloudy with a nice head they yields a bit of lacing. There is some beer dandruff floating around as well. Aroma is very fruity and citrus pine explosion. There's a huge pungent aroma, this beer doesn't fuck around. Flavor is Lindy and citrusey. Very nice but not quite as pungent as the aroma and a bit sweeter. The sweetness however does not increase the mouthfeel at all. Light and dry. Very frighteningly drinkable. Definitely happy to have traded for this."

"overall GREAT glad i finally got a hold of one"

"This stuff is miles above 99% of the DIPAs I've had, wow. Totally complex yet eminently drinkable, this is the new standard. Definitely deserving of the score and the hype."
"Not the be-all, end-all of DIPAs. I thought it was very reminiscent of Mongo (bottle variety, not draft). Sharp, hop-forward, and full of floaties."
""
"O: Highly recommeded. If you're looking for a DIPA, this one really has it all. Complete package. I.M.H.O., second only to Citra by Kern River."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent DIPA. On a hot day, it's easy to put down several of these with no problem. The best IPA I've had not from Hill Farmstead. Definitely recommended."
""
"Yet another brew I had, but for some reason didn't rate it right after I had it. Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium body with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Taste is similar to some west coast DIPAs. Which is not a bad thing! This is Delicious."
""
"O-Pretty awesome beer, I could and would always have this in the fridge if I was not relying on trading to come by it. I really like IIPA's of this variety, much more polished than the likes of Hopsickle and Hoptuimum."
"Thanks to my wife for picking these up for me when she was in VT this past weekend. Drinkin' from the can as is customary. Did pour a little to take a peek, hazy golden in color, dense head which fades away quickly. Pretty dank smell, resinous, pine, and some citrus, it does pop pretty hard. The taste is as expected, hop forward. Snappy, pine, citrus, chewy hops. Then some more hops. Not so bitter, actually much more of a fruity hop affair. This is a little refined for me, I tend to like my IIPAs rough and tough. Leaves the palate dry and crisp finish. Smooth as silk mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No trace of alcohol, drinks as easy as advertised."
"Overall: Great IPA. Fantastic floral hopping with a great hop-filled taste. This is a beer I would have again. The 8% alcohol content, and high drinkability also make this beer phenomenal."
"16 oz can generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a very cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The aroma is big mango, floral notes, light caramel, a bit of pineapple, and some sugar cookie. The initial taste is sweet with mango and pineapple going into a bit of caramel, sugar cookie, and some light dankness. There is a very light bitterness on finish along with some lingering mango. Light bodied. Low carbonation. I definitely could use a bit more bitterness and a bit less sweetness. Not bad, but certainly not in the class of the best west coast IPAs."
""
""
"O- If you love hoppy beers, beg, borrow, or steal to get this beer. Seriously, it’s THAT good. This right here is something special."
"O: This beer is amazing. Super assertive hops but not overwhelmingly bitter. Could just be the bitter factors of the hops used. This is the Hoptimum of tropical fruit hop flavors. Exceptional."

"O-this is such a great IPA. it just has this really good rich unique flavor. the more i drink it, the more i enjoy it. it just goes down so smoothly. I wish it weren't so expensive and difficult to find. definitely amazingfrom the can though!"
"O- This is by far one of the best DIPA in the country. I'm thankful that I grew up in Vermont and had the privilege to drink these like water. Thank you Alchemist"
"O: This is a nicely balanced DIPA, which is further helped by it only being 8%. Although it's certainly not the best DIPA out there (a bit too dry), it is pretty nice."
""
"O-great DIPA with a nice balance of flavors and a great example of the style"
""
""
""
""
"O- Thought I had tasted them all when they came to IPAs and DIPAs but whatever your opinion is on this one...it's truly unique. Just very very bitter, hoppy and grassy but very enjoyable"
"Overall: Definitely enjoyable, and a beer I'll be glad to have time and time again. I just wish I got more than a whisper of hop on the nose."
""
""
""
"O - This is unbelievably easy drinking, I'm afraid this four pack isn't going to last very long. Which sucks since the inflated shop price was $18. I don't think its one of the best beers in the world, but it is really high up when it comes to DIPA's."
"O: Quite a nice IPA. I wasn't expecting much, given that it's an East Coast brewery (no offense, but the hoppy beers are not necessarily as world-renowned as some of the West Coast ones), but I was pleasantly surprised."
""
"O: Quite good. About as good as IPA's get. And actually drinkable!"
""
"O: This is a pretty damn tasty DIPA but really not that different from others of the same quality. It's good but doesn't have that quality that says """wow""" to me."
"Overall I'd say this beer is worth the hype surrounding it. One of the easiest drinking and tastiest Double IPA's hands down. Still hoping some day I can get this locally."
""
"O: Easily one of the best DIPAs out there. The smell of this beer alone is unbelievable. I can't wait until The Alchemist can get Topper in to the Boston market regularly. Cheers!"
""
"O: This is the DIPA to beat at the moment for me."
""
""
"Heady Topper pours a hazy slightly dull orange. There are some tangerine highlights, and visibility is minimal. There's about a finger and a half of cream colored foam crowning the beer, and head retention is just OK. Lacing is fairly nice though, more of the glass is left covered in it than not. The second pour does result in plenty of sediment hanging in suspension. The nose is absolutely wonderful. Tons of mango and pineapple, with some more overtly citrusy grapefruit present in more of a supporting role. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of candied sugar sweetness. The bitterness that rolls through next is surprisingly mild/smooth. I kind of wish it was a little bit more intense/attention grabbing. The hoppy close though is just as fantastic as the nose though, with tons of tropical fruit and just a ittle bit of citrus. The mouthfeel is spot on. The body's not quite Belgian style brew dry, but it has just a little bit more heft to support it. Meanwhile, the carbonation explodes on my palate, helping the potent hoppy flavors to come alive. Heady Topper's a stunning beer, and one of the abslute best double IPAs I've had to date."

"Several cans, from the can. Aroma is a burst of juicy fruity hops; pinneaples, mangos and oranges. Some wet grass and resinous hops which tends to fade as the beer gets older. Taste: I’d say it is the best tasting double IPA I’ve ever had. Flavors are very coherent with the aroma. Definitly hops at its best. The perfect level of bitterness with a sharp citrus touch. Balance and drinkability is through the roof and alcohol is very well hidden. The ultimate beach beverage"
"good, but not sure it lives up to the crazy hype and higher price. seems quite similar to other citrusy DIPA's. still glad I got to try it though."
"O- Heady and Flower Power represent the east coast shouting back at the west coast saying we can do this too! This is an incredible experience of drinkability coupled with an onslaught of hoppy flavors. What a DIPA! I need more! Come to Syracuse Alchemist!"
""
""
"When it comes to beers of this caliber I am not looking for smoothness.. I like my senses to be awoken and this beer delivers."
""
"O: As good as hyped. Seek this out if you can find it, and then hoard what you get your hands on."
""
""
"O: This is a raw, down-and-dirty, throwback beer. Haven't had one like this in a good long while. My favorite thing about it is that it's different from the other big DIPAs that everyone gushes over. The market is begging right now for a more traditional, citrusy, good ol' Imperial Hop Bomb - which is what this is."
"It's as good as advertised. Period. If you're lucky enough to find a can, don't pass it up. I could go on and on about the nose, head, color, mouthfeel and finish but everyone else has already said it. In my book, this is the king. It ruined me for other IPAs and until I can find more I'm drinking Sculpin and Deviant Dales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I They say to drink from the can and i say yes(though it is awesome out of a glass as well). I think this is an exceptional imperial Ipa. Something to be duplicated, and sought after. I have had and love some Pliny, but I am taking the Topper side. Both great beers but the Alchemist takes the top spot in this battle."
"O: Get it and drink it, it is worth the hype. If trading for it make sure it is fresh as it does lose it's hop profile faster than most other DIPA's I have had."
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely one of the best DIPA's out there. Just as good as my beloved Pliny. Highly recommended."
""
""
"An amazing DIPA. My favorite for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Heady Topper is simply the best Imperial IPA I have ever tasted. Pours out of the can with an aroma of citrus and hops. The unfiltered appearance of this beer works so well with the aroma and adds quite a bit to the experience. The taste is a complex mix of heavy citrus and light hoppy flavor. Very well balanced with a crisp, enjoyable finish. A world class beer out of a can."
""
""
"O: Perfect double IPA. Flavors are spot on and drinkability is perfect. Awesome!"
"O - This just might be my favorite double IPA. Incredibly delicious and highly drinkable. I hope Philadelphia starts to gets a steady supply of this stuff."
""
"Overall WOW!!!! This just might be the perfect IPA style beer. Its better then pliny the younger its better then hopslam and its better then 120. I am impressed by this. And its not filtered so all that beautiful hop resin is just floating around. If you have a chance to try this by all means get it!!!"
""
""
"O: This is an all time favorite. The balance is amazing and you can't tell one bit that it is an 8% beer. A trip to VT is incomplete without going to the Alchemist."
"Cloudy golden yellow with a short pale white head. Pale malts, light citrus, fresh and dry hops, lighter fruits grapefruit, pineapple and even tones of peach on the aroma. Fruity and floral from the nose. Rich, smooth fruity and nectar-like hop flavor on the first sip. Rolls into a more floral body with big hits of hops, grapefruit, peaches and dry bitterness. Dry, hoppy, sour finish. Heavily carbonated with a medium body. Intensely impressed with this, easily the best brew I could ever dream of having out of a can."
"Heady Topper blew my mind just like the dude on the can. This is right up there with all the best DIPAs. I would seek this out whenever possible."
""
""
"O- This is up there with all my favorites in this category (Pliny, Abrasive, etc.). I will definitely try to obtain some more of this."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was not noteworthy; having it from the can. The taste is so good I didn't have time to notice anyway. What a great beer. Only the ABV would prevent me from drinking my entire 4 pack in one sitting. Next one will be in a glass..."
""
"Overall, this is a very good DIPA. I've had others I prefer, but that in no way is a knock on this beer as the reason I prefer others is balance. I also prefer more hop emphasis on aroma and taste rather than bitterness. That's just personal preference."
"Verdict: Sublime IPA, I still like Pliny a bit more, but this is just an incredible beer. I like everything that’s happening here, great hop profile, the flavors are balanced exceptionally well, certainly one of those beers where you suddenly look down and the glass is empty, it’s that good. Cheers to The Alchemist, I will definitely have to get a lot more of this."
"The Cannery makes for a nice easy diversion and is a quick jaunt from Burlington. Since we can't review breweries here for whatever reason, I'll just quickly note that they have a nice simple set-up, plenty of cans for purchase, sample-sized pours on tap, and lots of neat merch, as well as a self-guided tour. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O: The tropical notes are out of this world. Nicely balanced with bread and caramel and not aggressively bitter. Very easy drinking with no hint of the 8% abv. This is a beautiful beer."
""
""
""
"O: What can I say, privledged to have tried it, and I think this is probably the best IIPA I have had. Too bad its so hard to get."
""
""
"thanks Wil (The Beer Store)."
"There is such a smooth texture to this beer. A raw texture which makes it far from watery. And oh my goodness!! It is easy to drink."
""
""
"If one believed all he read on Beer Advocate then so he would think Heady Topper the best DIPA in the world - and so he would be wrong. I don't wish to take anything away from the fine people at The Alchemist - this is a damn fine brewsky - but there are many out there just like it. Seek it out, by all means, but don't trade the stars and the moon."
""
""
"Overall this beer is one for the ages. Those that have not tried it yet, this is a must. I'm a hug fan of Pliny, my only perfect """5"" I ever reviewed, but this beer comes real close to perfection, real damn close. Amazing beer."
"what else to say? definite candidate for if you could drink one beer, and one beer only."
""
"Feel is pretty much medium, but it really drinks easy as hell, goes down without a burn and not a alarming overly bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is there and not overly done. After the CAN was done, my mouth is not attacked and wrecked, this is the sign of a great DIPA, one that you can drink a few of. I don't know what else to say, this is tasty beer."
"O: Good. Damn good. What all other IPA's should aspire to. Better than PtE? I'd say so."
""
""
"I have been meaning to review Heady Topper for a few weeks now but this seems like as good of a time as any. Thanks to my brother (Mitchell) for going way out of the way to pick up a case while in Vermont. While I will agree with many that Heady will not be winning any awards for appearance, it certainly deserves ever bit of its rating on BA. Heady Topper is definitely one of the best IIPA’s I have ever drank in my life. The hops come in waves and while it never overpowers you it continuously lets you know you are drinking an IIPA. It is scary because it is so drinkable that I could throw back a few of these without hesitation but at 8% is will definitely let you know you have been drinking. It starts off with wave after wave of piney citrus hops in the nose. The hops are present but very drinkable with the same piney citrus mouth feel. This beer is unbelievable as sip after sip coats your mouth with a wave of hops. This beer is definitely better cold as it looses some of the wonderful characteristics as it warms. Follow the instructions on the can and drink it fresh, cold, and from the can and you will not be disappointed!"
"o: awesome! my only gripe, i wish it was filtered and had more carbonation, for appearance sake. i know, i know, if i would drink from the can it wouldnt matter."
""
""
"Heard great things about this beer, so when i finally made my way to the brewery i bought an entire case to bring back home because they don't distribute in my area. anyhoo, it was one of the greatest beers I have ever had. What really got me was the aroma, i was practically drinking with my nose. I also love how it comes in a four pack of 16 ounce cans, not a 22 ounce bottle like most of those world class beers. I am definitely making another trip up for some more. The only thing I thought can be a bad thing or good thing i guess is you will have that delicious taste in your mouth for a while. So if you are having any other beer, it may taste like Heady Topper!"

"O: There is great balance in this beer. It's certainly quite hoppy, but it's not overly bitter, not overly sweet, and not overly watery. The hop flavor and aroma is in your face, too. I suggest leaving a couple ounces in the can, though - otherwise there is lots of yeast."
"O: Overall, one of the best example I have tried of one of my favorite styles.  I still think fresh Hopslam is the epitome of the DIPA style, and this one doesn't knock the king off it's thrown, but I think it's fair to say its my #2.  Blows Pliny the Elder out of the water if you ask me, and that's saying something.  Definitely a beer all hop heads need to try. For the next one, I think I will drink it out of the can.  And I can't wait.  "
"FINALLY! Thanks Dave! Pours a hazy/cloudy golden-orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is just what anyone would want in a DIPA...such lovely hop aroma! Tropical hops with intense, bitter pine notes. Smells so fresh and hoppy...pineapple, grapefruit, melon, pine sap, guava, orange, lemon...SO INVITING. Taste is lacking in the malt profile...which is GREAT! Being from the west coast, this is just what I like. A little bit of malt, but not enough to make this delicious brew lose any points. Lovely citrus and tropical fruit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. No lingering bitterness with this beer...crisp and clean. The palate is miraculously wiped clean after a few seconds of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavor, and crisp finish. Drinkability is Very High. ABV not even noticeable. Overall, this was a great experience. I am very impressed considering this drinks like a west coast style DIPA...love the lack of malt. I wish I had regular access to this so I could drink it like the can recommends... straight from the can. Brilliant beer!"
"O - Stop reading this review and buy/trade for this beer. it's the bees-knees."
""
"Want more."
""
""
"the flavor is a bit more pine than citrus, like the new green needles on a fir or spruce (minus the resiny bitterness). it's what a DIPA is supposed to be - a flavorful combination of hops with enough malt to cut the acid and bitterness, allowing you to taste it all the way through. it's complex but straightforward and to the point. possibly one of my favorite DIPA's - up with Pliny and Hopslam, but stands apart due to it's bitterness (in comparison) and complex hop flavors. I'm a major fan, now if only I could get it more often..."
""
"O- Looks like homebrew gone bad, but smells and tastes amazing. Only thing I would really change is to up the carbonation just a bit."
"O - One of the best northeast IIPA's I've had. A great job of taking some floral, piney hops and integrating a wonderful citrus flavor that keeps you coming back. Very drinkable and delicious. Overall, I can't really find many holes in this beer. It hit all the spots that it should, and then some. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious citrus flavors, interesting malt profile. Exceedingly drinkable, esp. for such a big beer."
"Oh my god!!! they really hit this one out the park, smells like citrus, grapefruit,and pine. just had a zombie dust the other day and this one is just as nice of a tasty beer. one is not enough, makes you want to have more and more again. and this all comes from a can WOW."
""
"pours a very hazy peach color with loads of sediment floating around and white ring. The nose has a fair bit of citrus and notes of grapefruit. Faint undertone of a sweet caramel malt. The flavor is nice, sweet hops and malts blend together but seems well attenuated. Light grapefruit and bitter citrus round off the dominant hop presence as the bitterness lingers for a moment but doesn't disrupt the drinkability. The body is very inviting with a gentle tingling carbonation and a smooth soft feel to it."
"I can't recall in recent memory a beer that makes me this happy (except maybe Pliny the Elder)..."
""
"Overall-This was probably the single best IPA I will have. When I started to drink this I thought to myself how can anyone drive a couple hundred miles for this beer-now I've pulled a 180. How can I not drive to VT for this when I'm already in upstate NY. After I drank this beer I refused to rate/take notes in the beers I had the same week-for a very simple reason. There is no way another beer can line up. This beer is perfection in a can."
""
""
"Well, Heady Topper only being sold locally is both a blessing and a curse... This beer lives up to all the hype. Wave after wave of insanely fresh hops, with absolutely explosive aftertastes. I stick to The Alchemist's recommendation, and drink it straight from the can, so it's tough to comment on appearance, but that's hardly necessary for this big, fresh double IPA. In spite of being a slightly lower ABV than many double IPAs, it packs a bit of a punch, probably because the alcohol is entirely covered up by the hops. Make sure you drink it fresh, and don't fear drinking it out of the can!"
""
""
""
""
"all in all, loved this beer, wish it was easier to get for me."
""
""
""
""
"Hop insanity in a can! Lots of talk about this brewski finally being canned. The greatness forgives the sheer rawness it brings to the palate. In our opinion, this is what sets it apart from other highly hopped ales in the US. Keep it tamed in the can, as pouring it out will only show the extreme rustic measures to make this beer."
"O - Despite the lofty expectations I had for this beer, I was not disappointed. It is not overwhelmingly hoppy for the style, but the hop flavors work very well with the dominating citrus and tropical fruits. The finish and aftertaste are a remarkable blend of bitter and sweet. I was able to keep myself to only consuming two tonight, but I easily could have drank all four. A beer deserving of its world class rating that I will certainly seek out in future trades. It is not the hoppiest or biggest, but it is damn near the best. I highly recommend it."
""
"Overall: Not bad. Not bad at all."
"Very evident why you need to drink this one out of the can, it has perfect balance and comes out of the gates swinging with a unique east coast bold hop profile. Raw and resinous yet well crafted. A beer that is blue collar, steady and bold. Glad for the opportunity."
"Overall - It reminded me of a pliny meets rad racer taste wise. It's got a lot of lemony citrus flavour that almost makes it seem more like an IPA than a DIPA. I consider this the pliny of the east - worth seeking out."
""
"Great beer, so glad I finally got to try it. This definitely goes towards the top of the list for the style."
""
""
"O - as the can says """so drinkable it is scary""". Pretty delicious. Extra credit for local and canned. My favorite beer style, done right. How can I not give it 5's. Going to have to have a blind taste test with Resin and G'Knight."
""
""

""
""
"O - Overall, I've been trying to get this beer for a long time I am a """Hophead""" and I'm glad I got to try this one. It is a wonderful DIPA and has lived up to the hype I will try to get this one again."
"Out of the can, from multiple fresh deliveries in VT. Thee hops, citrus, pine, and malt come together perfectly. Not the biggest fan of drinking from cans, but it seems thats the brewers preference. Not much booze until it warms up, which makes that 8% catch up with you fast, but the cans also warns you off this. Listen. The can makes it feel like a session beer but it's far for a session beer. Def one of my favorites, but meant to be shared, paired, and part of tastings"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : I really love to drink this beer quickly I just can't seem to sip this one. I suggest drinking this one in a big gulps. Every BA owes it to themselves to seek this beer out. Make sure to get your self a 4pak because one is not enough"
""
""
"My biggest criticism of Heady Topper is its relatively thin body compared to other DIPAs. It's much improved on draft (vs the cans I've had), yet still lacking. But this is just splitting hairs -- HT is easily one of the best DIPAs brewed today."
""
"D: Certainly a very, very good IPA. Actually reminded me a lot of Sculpin, but more bitter. Would definitely like to have this one again."
""
"O: Incredible """drinkability""" I think someone should give up their slogan. Haha. Really glad I got my hands on one of these, thanks to ixodus for throwing in this amazing extra. It was so good im going to have to get more at some point."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lives up to the hype and then some. Between Abner and Heady, I think I'll start searching for jobs in Vermont."
""
""
"Overall, the best dipa I've had to date. It's hop nectar to the extreme. I don't want the experience to end!"
"O- Horrible to look at, AMAZING to sit and smell... tastes sweet and has a nice honey citrus flavor. Almost too sweet for an IIPA. Not enough citrusy punch for my liking. Very unusual and glad I tried it. Big thanks to Ubufan2112 for hooking me up! I'd certainly love to try this one again. This woulda scored much higher if it weren't for the appearance."
""
""
"Pours a hazy, light tangerine with a two-finger bright white head. Good lacing and head retention. Aroma, wow. Fresh pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange and just a touch of pine that is outdone by the huge, fresh fruity notes. This beer is so refreshingly hoppy. Big tropical fruit notes, pineapple is giant. Juciy, fresh grapefruit and orange notes. Nice pine notes add some bitterness too. Hugely hoppy, but with the perfect amount of bitterness. Get different hop notes with each sip and they keep coming. Awesome drinkability, the hop blend goes down like a Gatorade. Overall, the best DIPA I've had to date. Really tough to make this big of a beer this easy to drink while maintaining absolutely huge flavor."
""
""
"Overall: must try, must try again...must have on hand Always!"
""
"This beer is a hazy yellow-orange. Tons of hop floaties in there. No head. Yet another reason to drink it from the can! The aroma is sublimely hoppy. Citrus, pine, and resin aromas dominate on the nose. Taste? Oh dear god. HOPS. I could say that there's a light amount of caramel malts, but it's really a secondary flavor to the absurd amount of DELICIOUS hops in here. It's nowhere near overly bitter, instead just providing an absolutely delicious, resiny hop experience with so many layers. The mouthfeel is fairly light and goes down very easily. The drinkability is absurdly good, I can crush this down like it's a 5% pale ale. If you like IPAs, you HAVE to experience this beer, at any cost. It's absolutely fantastic. World class. And yes, it is better from the can."
""
"Can (thanks Stephen): Poured a cloudy light yellow color ale with large chunks of protein floating around and a large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of super intense pine hops notes with some citrus and resin notes. Taste is also a super intense mix of pine, resin and light citrus undertones hops with a dry malt backbone that is hard to distinguish from the hops attack. The floral aromas are huge end very enjoyable. Body is full with great carbonation. I must admit the hype is totally justified for this one, truly one of the great IIPA."
""
"O: Overall is very, very drinkable. An ideal tropical island drink with an ideal tropical and citrusy hop nature. Very even flow of hoppiness, refined and smooth with citric elements, peppery spicing and keg worthy. Would be my go to IPA if demand and market allowed. Again love the fact that it has a clean pale grain base, strong hop presence and junk in the glass for a visual bonus.Gentle lingering spicy west coast hops provide an invite for the next sip. Didn’t want this beer to be finished."
"Simply put this is an awesome double IPA and is something brewers around the country need to measure themselves against."
""
""
"Layered complexity in the hop aroma is a real treat here but the bitterness is somewhat harsh and hinders drinkability. Wishing for something smoother. Certainly a very good beer but there's definitely room for improvement."
"O - This beer was delicious and one of the most unique DIPAs I've had. First of all, it looks very different, with a very hazy appearance and lots of floaters. Despite this, it smells and tastes terrific and very different than most other DIPAs. It has lots of piney aromas and flavors while a lot of others have mostly citrusy and grapefruit smells and tastes. It is very unique, very tasty, and if you can get your hands on it, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. Except for the appearance, this is very close to perfection."
"O- A very good DIPA, but I'm not quite sure what makes this one so much better than any other."
""
"Overall - Great DIPA, aroma is through the roof and the malts stand up to the super hoppy beer very well without being dominant. Definitely worth trading for if you can."
"O: An excellent hop crazy beer, easy to drink, decent abv and refreshing as well"
"A very well executed imperial IPA. Having tried a fresh Pliny the Elder recently I have to say this blows it away. Totally worth seeking. I'll be looking for more in the future. "
""
""
""
"PS- Flavor is more direct out if the can but I prefer it in the glass. Give both a try."
""
"Overall, an excellent, superbly balanced DIPA. Certainly worth seeking out. 4.5"
"Pours a murky honey yellow with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is fantastic with citrus zest, citrus fruit, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is the same with citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit up front with a malt finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional DIPA with some amazing aromas and flavors."

"O: This beer is well-deserving of the hype it receives. The drinkability is incredible. I was a little put-off at first by all the hop sediment, and I do wonder how it impacted the flavor. I also probably should've had a couple of tastes straight from the can. I guess I will just need to track down more. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had."

"overall - yes this beer tastes great and its worth seeking out to try once - i will drink my last one out of the can as the brewer intended if my opinions change so will this review"
"Overall, a great beer, deserving of the top 10 on BA? Maybe not, but an incredibly drinkable IPA"
""
""
""
"O: quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. Crazy hops, the freshest rawest beer I've had. So tropical and drinkable it's insane. I could session on this. Must try, lives up to the hype."
""
" Love the can!"
"Overall this is a solid example of an IPA."
"When you're convinced of the impossibility of ever tasting a better IPA, something like this comes along and shows new possibility in flavor intensity, dryness, drnkability, and absolute elegance and finesse. It's hard to keep this beer off of the """perfect""" line score."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely the best IPA I've ever had, and maybe the best beer I've ever had overall. I can't say enough good things. Deserves its 100 rating and then some."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: my only complaint is that I don't care for the floaties, but that's likely because I didn't let it sit longer than 1 hour from the time I got it to when I drank it, and my pour was poorly executed."
"Can't say much more other than this being one of my top 3 DIPAs to date. Splendid, dangerously drinkable, and I need to get more."
"Overall, this was by far one of the tastiest DIPAs I've had. It stands right up there with the Plinys in terms of complex hoppy and sweet tastes, and it was incredibly drinkable. I'm really looking forward to the next one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent beer, wish I could get more but it doesn't get up to New York often especially Long Island. Had a buddy at a pub share one, and a friend from a bevy sell me one. It's good to be friends with your distro guys."
""
""
"I can see why this is considered the cream of the crop in the vast category of DIPA's. The bitterness is there to refresh rather than to destroy the palate. This is all about the fruitiness of the hop and that's what I love."
""
""
"A fantastic DIPA, and it works wonderfully in the can format. I really wish this was easier to obtain, everyone deserves to try this gem."
"O: All in all, yep, this is one of the best IPA's I've had. If you like an IPA that blends all flavors exceptionally well, than this will blow your mind. If you like an IPA that is just bitter and nothing else, this is satisfy, but not blow you away. A must try for the hop lover!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Wow. Not an over powering hop bomb but a balanced hop force. It is a wonderful beer. I would love to be able to have it every day. I had side by side with PtE. Blew PtE out of the water. The best beer I've ever had."

"Too bad its not everywhere, but for those of us living in VT its a treat. Make your way up to see the factory in Stowe is worth a visit If you can get your hands on some then you will understand!"
""
""
"A very, very tasty DIPA... probably the best East Coast DIPA I can recall ever tasting (OK, not counting some of the limited release stuff from Hill Farmstead). Delicious stuff."
""
""
""
""
"It deserves the current 100 rating it has, since I can't say I've ever tasted a better version of this style. Read what everybody else has to say while I enjoy this without distraction:)"
""""Stopped by the Alchemist cannery the other day on a recent trip to VT and sampled some freshly brewed Heady Topper. All I can say is, WOW! By far, one of the best beers that I’ve tried to date, regardless of style, and a sure ‘must-try’ for all who appreciate the finer beers of the world. Hoping that this becomes more available in MA, because as of now, there are only a few places that you can enjoy this ‘world-class’ brew. I’ve yet to try Pliny, but have read that this DIPA rivals it. If you get the opportunity to try this, it’s a must. Kudos Alchemist, looking forward to other offerings in the near future.""""
"O: I was afraid this wasn't going to live up to the hype but it absolutley did, I've never had a DIPA with pineapple characteristics before and it mixed with the other fruits and hops so well. I couldn't be happier with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"There isn't much that can be said about this holy elixir that hasn't already been said -- aside from the fact that given the opportunity I'd probably crawl in the can to live out the rest of my years (which are most likely a good number). I get to enjoy this usually every month or so, and simply put: it's the best out there. I've had it 7 days old and 7 months old. Nothing beats it fresh but even after half a year it still tastes incredible. Pour half in a snifter and enjoy half in the can. The smell upon cracking that can will blow you away. Definitely my favorite double IPA out there and probably my favorite overall. It will never get old. The hype is real! If you have a chance to get your hands on this, do so...by any means possible. (well maybe not ANY)"
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best out there. It has a lofty rating for a reason. I have yet to have one of the fabled """off cans", and I'm damn glad."
"I mentioned to a co-worker that I was just in Vermont and found nothing (good) locally other than 'Long Trail' and he hit me with a pint can of Heady Topper - Thanks Will !!! - I poured some into a tulip and left some in the can whilst alternating sips - and before I knew it - it was all gone !! - and i wished I had more - poured hazy and light orange with suspended spherical globules (of the hop resin?) - like a little universe of it's own in my glass - a 1 finger head that dissipated into a slight film reaching out to a 1/4 inch ring - the hops were in the air as soon as i 'pulled the pop-top' - the zing and zest of hops resin was immediate and awesome - just sticky enough with a mildly sweet finish - this beer is amazing for all the right reasons - hype be damned!"
"(Observation; though they exclaim, """DRINK FROM THE CAN!""" the can clearly shows this guy drinking from a pint. Things that make you go, """hmm""".)"
""
""
""
"Overall: Extremely drinkable. Extremely fresh. Extremely hoppy. Extremely WOW!"
"O: Very tasty and stays interesting through the whole can. Having this the day after a side-by-side of PtY and PtE, I think I'd put this above Elder and a bit below Younger, at least based on what my palate has been preferring lately. At another time, I might have found this a little too sweet. I do think that this is taking a hit on account of the can format."
"Poured an orange brown, severely unfiltered with large particles that sit in suspension and on the base of the tulip. Good retention and spotty lace however. Nose is brilliant, but slightly more right out of the can (is this why they want you to drink it right out of the can?), loses a bit when poured into the glass. Tons of mango, pineapple, resiny, juicy and oily. Light dankness. A good amount of malt to balance. Taste has loads of grapefruit, mango and passionfruit. Chewy sweet malt character reasserting the """East Coast-iness""" of this DIPA. Solid bitterness in the finish and some sweetness to lightly offset it. No alcohol to be found, and this was incredibly poundable. I can only imagine having access to this locally - a quintessential East Coast DIPA and fully lived up to expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall; direct from the can or in a glass, this is a damn fine beer. I'll be sad when Im outta these..."
"Consuming this beer from the can (as opposed to from out of a glass) has multiple benefits. The carbonation becomes stronger which adds to both the mouthfeel and the drinkability. The flavor becomes a bit more citrusy and loses a bit of the bitterness."
""
"An incredible, world-class Double IPA that is more than worthy of all the praise it receives. Very complex for the style, it’s got a little of everything a hophead desires. While I should be going slow and savoring my only can, this is dangerously drinkable and going down pretty fast. Fantastic!"
""
"got a new fuzz pedal for my guitar today and the best batch of Heady to date. Life is good."
""
"Overall - a very rich and rewarding beer. The kind of beer that spoils you and makes you question others that you liked a month ago ..."
""
"O. Really good, well above average DIPA. Best beer out of a can that I have had."
"I have had it right from the can and ive had it out of a pint glass and its just so dam tasty i cant believe it packs a pretty good punch with 8%abv. So fresh and smooth"
"I have had Pliny the Elder fresh from the RR brew pub and Heady Topper from a can is every bit as good. Absolutely one of the best 2-3 beers that I have ever had."
""
""
"This is a hop bomb like no other. Rough & raw, but if you love grapefruity DIPAs like a PTE, you'll love this."
"O - Great beer, something I can enjoy over and over again"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was wondering if this would live up to the hype and it certainly did. It is certainly the best DIPA I've tasted. Not even because of the flavors but just because how well balanced everything was. I'll be interested to see the difference in a few weeks from the fresh one I have right now. The only disappointment is after this is gone, I won't be getting any for quite awhile."
""
"Mouthfeel comes across with a nice smooth and creamy medium body feel. Overall, Heady Topper is hard to beat. I might just have to make more trips to Vermont from now on."
"World Class."
"pours a golden amber into my snifter capped by small head with good retention. Head reduces to a lacing cap. Aroma is of tropical fruit and light caramel. Pineapple upfront on the palate with tangerine, and canned peaches. Caramel provides the backbone. Mouth is light bodied. excellent."
"As a rejoinder, I'll add that I've drank Heady Topper straight from the can, though I didn't find that that method of presentation impacted the taste at all. In the end, I suppose it's just not for me, though certainly not terrible."
"My man Dino hooked up a 4 pack which he said was canned a week and a half ago. I immediately opened one. The can says to drink out of the can so for appearance I poured the 2nd can into a pint glass. The beer in glass pours a cloudy golden color, light from the pale malts, good retention and lacing. The rest of this review will be from the can. The aroma is huge and heavy as soon as you crack the beer. Tons of tropical citrus hop character assault your senses. I guess I should have expected as much from the 120 IBUs. I can't tell how this beer could smell any better: no hint of alcohol and an overload of hops. Perfect. The taste build on the aroma, if that is even possible, you again are assaulted with the tropical citrus hop flavor and yet a bit of piney resin is prevalent, too. Unbelievably smooth. Unreal how balanced this beer is. Malty sweetness with fruity character from the hops. Clean. Smooth. Medium bitterness, not over the top, no clue this is 8%abv. Amazing flavor. Again, not sure how this can get any better. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and rich and smooth. Very well balanced. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. Perhaps because it was fresh, this is now the standard for DIPAs, sorry Pliny. I will do whatever I can to obtain more. Terrific."

"O: I got a 4 pack of this bad boy from a buddy who lives in the Boston area. I've had many IPA's and DIPA's but there's something different about this one. Every sip you take invites you back for several more. I received a box with a 4 pack of Heady Topper, 4 pack of FBS, 3 Expedition Stouts and a FW 14th anniversary bottle and i honestly would have been more than content drinking the Heady Topper all night. Absolutely lives up to it's rep...I just wish I had more. I've never had Pliny but if it's better than Heady Topper then it's the world's 8th wonder. Absolutely delicious...get some if ya can."
"Great to drink some fresh, fantastically hoppy beer from New England. As the Bros. have preached all along, East Coasters know how to hop (even if they are emulating West Coasters). Prost! Slainte! Cheers!"
"I am so glad I have finally been able to get a taste of east coast goodness, it really lives up to the hype, truly unique and original."
"Great double IPA. One of the best i have ever had. Reminds me of galactic double daisy cutter, but definitely has its differences. I am really getting in to can beers lately and the 16oz can makes for a great disc golf companion. If this was shelf beer where i lived i would be in trouble and they might run out."
""
""
"Overall: An absolute hop-bomb. Must drink for any hop-head! Might be a 'better' beer if it had some malt flavor, but that's really not what the brewer is going for here."
""
""
"Now - I am going to try a second one straight out of the can instead of from the glass. *Drum roll* I like it better from the can! Never would have guessed. With this beer - picture drinking a milkshake out of a big straw vs drinking right from the glass. The can is the straw - you get more of a concentrated blast of taste vs from the glass. Perhaps it is because there is no aroma preview, so to speak. The various aspects of the flavor previously described seem more together, hitting me at once instead of in stages this way. The sweetness seems to stick around longer and the resinous aspect seems less earthy and more spicy, more organic. Delicious orange rind dominates. Changing this to a perfect score. I'm glad I have a decent amount of this - will be sharing with close friends. Get some if you can."
""
""
"Notes: One of the few beers I’ve had of late that not only lived up to the hype, but completely surpassed it. I think I need to plan a road trip in the near future to try and secure a case of this."
""

"I drank part from the can and part poured into a snifter. After pouring it into a glass it produces a nice 2 finger width white head that leaves nice lacing with each drink. It is opaque orange/copper color. The nose is amazing great fruit smells first grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of sweetness from a fruit like mango also there is a good piney smell along with the fruit smell. Great bitterness up front but it balances well with the sweetness form the malt the bitterness is a good combination of fruit bitterness like grapefruit and a piney bitterness. All round great balance of flavors that you find in DIPA's. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is on point for the style. Over all this is an amazing beer If I could buy this off the shelves where I live I would have two 4 packs on hand at all times."
"O – Overall a very impressive beer, so happy I got to try it and glad I have 3 more to enjoy. Not going to share these with anybody. I wish I was able to head to VT more often so I could get this on a regular basis. When they talk of hop shortages I know where they all went, into a can of Heady Topper!"
"O: World Class DIPA. My girlfriend loves that it’s from a can and I wish more great beers came from cans. All I need is more friends to visit Vermont! - 5"
"I am not a big fan of IPAs. It's not my style. However, if this beer is available, one shouldn't miss the opportunity to savor it."
"Overall (5.0): What’s interesting about Heady Topper is that I can fully recognize that this is just one point on the spectrum of (d)IPAs, in terms of the flavor profile and perhaps more specifically the hop profile. But, it seems almost inherently clear that this is more or less the pinnacle of one of those points in the spectrum. There’s undoubtedly other beers at least as enjoyable with different flavor and aroma profiles, maybe more citrusy and fruity or whatever, but they’re not better or worse so much as different. Like a pantheon of pinnacle (d)IPAs. And this almost certainly has a seat in that pantheon. Waxing poetic, maybe, so let me put it differently: this beer is totally tits. Go out and buy it, because especially at $12-13/ 4-pack, it’s worth every penny. Long Live The Alchemist."

"O: This beer is all about balance. One of the best balanced yet big DIPAs I've had. I like big harsh bitter bombs but this is just a thousand times more drinkable. I feel like I could have a bunch of these. That's what really sets it apart I think."
""
"This is one of the best IPA's I've tasted."

"O: Absolutely deserving of being deemed ‘world class.’ One of, if not, the best DIPA I’ve had to date."

"Poured into my Roosters true pint glass a very nice cloudy golden orange color, lots of floaties also, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger thick creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The second I popped this open I could smell hops, the nose is hoppy, with a nice little malt blend, a very nice citrus note, and some nice pineyness. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, malty, with some nice citrus notes, and pines. Medium body, with a nice slightly bitter/dry finish, pretty chewy also. Just had a side by side comparsion with a fresh bottle of Pliny the Elder and this brew (fresh also), looks and taste are a HUGE difference, no comparision at all, the PtE wins hands down. I cannot go with the hype on this brew at all, nice but no where near the hype, sorry. This is a nice DIPA in a can, and I have another can also, LOL Thanks Ben and David."
""
"O- Absolutely Awesome! This is probably the most well balanced, best DIPA that I have ever drank. This is one of the most hoppy beers I've encountered but it has a perfect balance between the hops, sweetness, citrus flavors, etc.. Would most certainly buy again. Great beer highly recommended if you are ever in Vermont. This is a perfect example of everything you want in a DIPA. Absolutely nothing wrong with it. A must have."
""
""
""
"O: Very good. Very, very good. Forget the weird, goopy/brackish appearance and it's among the best I've tried, overall. OK, it IS among the best I've tried, regardless. Worthy of the 'hype', extremely tasty and sensual in all aspects. Gotta have one... but then you'll just want more."
"Looking forward to seeing this around Boston more."

"Morey's Bottom Line: Well, this is my first HT, and I can honestly say that I wasn't let down at all. I've had Hopslam and Double Trouble within the last week, and this is a notch above both IMO. Seek this out!"
""
"The big guns keep on showing up for this Super Bowl party! This one pours a rusty tawn topped by over a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit zest, yellow grapefruit peel, orange zest, strong pine resin, light leek, and buttery toffee (think Crunch 'n' Munch). The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine, leek, and citrus peels come through stronger, taking things in an ever-so-slightly bitterer direction. Things are still very well-balanced, though. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a damn fine, nicely-balanced DIPA. Good times. (Note: We tried this both in the glass and straight out of the can. There was no consensus, as about half preferred the can and half preferred the glass. I was in the latter, though it wasn't a strong preference by any means.)"
""
""
"O - My first craft can. Delicious… I am going to have to seek more of these out. I wish I would have done a side-by-side with Pliny, but for right now, I’m leaning towards Heady. A great IPA."
"O: One of the best beers I've ever had. Probably my favorite IPA. I want more!"
"Overall I am so very grateful for this unexpected can of Dbl. IPA royalty. I ws waiting for the 7th anniv. of New Beer Sunday to try it, and I'm glad it lived up to the hype. I feel like this ale gives me spinach-to-Popeye strength. I think I'm slipping back into a dream. I'll stop here before I do."
"To people thinking of trying this beer, don't think, JUST GET SOME!"

"o. it's great, and worth finding fresh. easily one of the finest beers I've ever had. would be great if the alchemist decided to retire inside the beltline and start a Raleigh brewery. not hating, but the Raleigh area breweries have yet to attack this style, and I wish they would."
""
"O: Great Beer, I would drink it regularly if I didn't have to trade for each and every one of them."
""
"O - A beautiful IPA that in some ways makes me question if this truly a dIPA, or if it's just a really tasty IPA with a little extra kick. Super accessible for those out there who think they don't dig IPA, but also hoppy enough to keep the hopheads happy. A really refreshing dIPA, which isn't a way I'd characterize many of the others I've had. Full of bright, exciting flavor. Find some, put it in the glass (or keep it in the can, if you like), and eat it."

"Two hop-head friends of mine and I tried a month-old Pliny the Elder and a week-old Heady Topper side-by-side. Every one of us (after coming down from hop heaven) had to admit that the Heady was the better beer. It's better balanced (no Munich malt to detract from the hops, unlike Pliny) and has a more comprehensive hop presence. Of course, this is like picking between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz (Salma=Heady Topper): either one is reason for a whole lot of gratitude."

"Overall: Just ridiculous. An inordinate, unprecedented amount of hops. However, it does fall off quickly. These cans are about 10 days old.

"-i got a 4 pack of this on tuesday. drank the 1st the night of and it was pretty epic. i was a bit bummed to find by friday that the hop smell and flavor had changed so much. most of the flavor and smell was still there, it had just gained some soapy, harsh accent. for this i cant give it a 5 in both those categories. that being said, this is a great IIPA and i would put it right behind both plinys and citra. it just didnt have an unbelievability to it in certain areas like those"
"Not as crazy as I expected, but just a ridiculously hoppy, sweet, clean, smooth and drinkable dIPA... by far the greatest beverage I've ever had out of a can."
""

"O - Buy this beer! That is all I can recommend. I know that it doesn't get very far south of Burlington, but if you ever find it, buy it. This is not just the best IPA I have ever had; this is the best beer I have ever had."
"O- This is one of my favorite DIPAs you get everything here. Big huge hop aroma and flavor showing off the citrus and pine with a really nice malt balance. Really great drinkable Dipa. Go to the Alchemist cannery and get yourself a case. Thats what I did and Im riping through it like Hulk Hogan through his Hulkamania shirts. John stand up and take a bow sir, You have crafted a master piece. A+"

"This has a great hop profile and the smell and taste are extremely clean. A great DIPA."

"Taste is pretty much exactly what the nose leads you to believe. Grapefruit takes the lead, but dont forget about pine needles and lemon zest. Unlike Pliny, there is a pervading bitterness that just goes about a full-frontal assault on your tongue."

"-GFunk"
""
"This is a really good beer. The can says to drink from the can, so who am I to disobey a direct order. I can't really judge the appearance this way, but the can has a cool design. The smell is a certain citrusy aroma with hints of the can mixed in the smell. The taste is perhaps the most balanced DIPA. the hops are not overpowering, and the flavor is exceptionally complex. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, and a sour hop flavor come to the forefront. The most remarkable element is the smooth mouthfeel. One might even say it goes down soft. The aftertaste does not limit the experience, but takes it in a different direction. The citrusy flavors sweeten like candy. Most DIPAs express punch of bitter hops at this point, so this was surprising and refreshing. This beer is definitley worth the hype."

"I approached this beer as a skeptic, but it's easily one of the most complex beers I've tried, and one of the most drinkable at that. I should have bought a case."

"Overall: What can be said that already hasn't?"
""
""
"Overall- I already mentioned how drinkable this is for how hoppy and bitter it is. Why am I trading half this case again?"
"O: It lived up to the hype. Simply phenomenal. A hop bomb that doesnt leave me feeling like I drank syrup. The sweetness is toned down and this is just perfectly hoppy and clean."
""
""
"Really liked this beer. I'd have to say I prefer it in the can but maybe it's the suggestiveness of the brewer telling me I should."
""
"O: Really a very good beer, and I would love to try more of it at the freshest stage possible. All the same, however old this was it's very good, but lets be honest, it's not deserving of a 100 rating."
""
"While I could compare it to any number of IPA's that are stoutly hopped, this seemed to hold a magic that I could not quite describe."
""
""
"Wow, this is one hell of a beer! I'd really hit a lull with IPAs lately, & it's great to be reminded of what a really transcendent one can be like - such an awesome experience. I've heard a lot of talk about this giving PtE a run for the money, & I can see why."
""
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one, just bursts with flavor."
""
"O: Heady Topper has set the standard for DIPAs for me, and it's a pretty high standard, blows fresh Pliny out of the water in my opinion, no contest, will continue to seek this out as often as possible"
"O: I want more of this one! I can't think of an IIPA I've had that was better than this. A great mix of aromas and flavors. Everything just seems to work well together! Highly recommended! (On a side note, I drank my second HT straight from the can, and actually enjoyed it even more this way. Contrary to what you might think, if you get your hands on this beer, you should try it from the can."
"Overall, this beer deserves the attention it's getting and is very, very, very good. Perhaps the coolest aspect of it is that for all its hype and popularity, it doesn't cost any more than the regular DIPA's you get off the shelf. Kudos to the Alchemist for that!"

It's not bad, in fact it's a very pleasant brew. It simply doesn't reach the heights one would expect from it's rDev. Don't go out of your way to attain this. I know I won't."

"I honestly can't think of a way to make this beer much better. I guess filtering out the floaties wouldn't hurt. And at 8% it's a lot for my sensitive self. But I'm being really, really picky and a DIPA is what it is. Hope the brewpub is up and running again soon."

"the beer poursed a golden yellow color with orange hues and a 2 finger head that lasted a long time. the smell was huge citrus and piney hops with a subtle malt hint in the background. the flavors coming forth were huge grapefruit citrus and bitter piney hops in the finish with barely a trace of the malts in the nose. there was high carbonation with a dry light mouthfeel that left the mouth almost watering for more. huge bitterness that almost bit the tounge. overall this batch was the best ipa i have ever had, although when averaging out the batches of head i have had i like double sunshine and abner more. wish i had drank more of this batch and extra'd and traded less."

And after having all three, I honestly can't pick a favorite. I'd give Pliny the edge when on tap, super fresh bottle, or fresh growler. But Pliny really does seem to drop off after 2 weeks. If I had to rank them from this tasting, I'd say Abrasive > Heady Topper > Pliny. Thanks again for sharing these, Paul!"

"Cracked the can and poured into a glass. A nice orange color with lots of head and tons of shit floating in it. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the floaties but I certainly needed to deduct some points for that. I would normally just drink it from the can, as the can states, so it would not be an issue for me. This is a hop bomb, plain and simple. It is up there with the best of the best hop bombs. I love this beer and you will too."
""
"Overall Impression- And this is why I was looking for this one for the past year! Unbelievable! Thanks for sharing Mark. Both drinking from the glass and the can were enjoyable but from the can was very fun! Intense, fruits like crazy, and great amount of hop all kept this one above many I've ever had. Will be looking for this again! HIGHLY recommend."
"Grapefruits, citrus, pine, gummy bears. Mouthfeel was great and it was so refreshing. I refused to drink mine out of the can though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is truly a world-class DIPA, and a damn fine beer. I now know why this beer is alway mentioned in the top five for the style. It isn't as aggressive as Abrasive, but more so than Pliny. A must have to any hop-head. Cheers!"
""
"Overall: By far the best IPA I ever had. This one, compared to most other IPAs, is not only smelling great, but has a perfect balance and doesn’t dry out the tongue. I never thought I would say this about an IPA, but can drink this any time of the day."
"O: Simple: one of the best DIPAs out there! While Pliny the Elder may have set the style, I think this beer takes it to a better place."
""
""
""
"oh my god. definitely meets the expectations. I'm glad I spent my Christmas money to buy an entire case. I was going to share a lot of it, but I have a feeling I'll be drinking a lot of this the next week!!! Happy new year to me!!!"

"It's fairly thin, though. That was disappointing. Red's Rye and Sierra Nevada Celebration are thicker, and they're singles. I expected more from a double. It's nicely carbonated, but finishes thin. It tastes more full from the glass and thinner and more single-noted from the can."
""
""
""
"O - A great example of the style."
""
""
"Excellent excellent wxaple the style. Presents the citrus aspect as well as any other. Thanks a ton bhollas!"
"World class is right. The hops are so vibrant. It has a much more substantial malt base than, say, Pliny the Elder, but it is so tasty. I rarely give fives."
"Overall is tops. Worth the drive to VT. Worth whatever you need to trade to get some. I love this beer!"
"Overall: What a tasty beer that I was not expecting in the slightest. This is one that I'd go back to over and over again if available. Thanks again to cbeer for this awesome brew!"
""
""
""
"Cloudy yellow with a supersmell and dito taste and mouthfeel. Pineapple and other fruits all over the place!"
"O4.5 - A good solid DIPA and I really could appreciate the aftertaste this time."

"Thanks to satchboogie on shipping this one in a trade. Phenomenal nose, as good as Pliny or Hopslam. I really would say for my taste these 3 would b interchangeable as far as which one I like best. Number ratings don't tell how even they are. I drank from a glass on the first one can the next two. Looks great as fresh world class DIPA should, nice foam and you can get lost with your nose in the glass. Citrus, and lost of it, smooth hops, and a lot of that too, On my 1st can I was thinking of Pliny in a way to compare, but after having a few over the last few days I'm changing that up a bit. It comes on first sip like Pliny, then somewhere along the line the overwhelming hops kicks in and it's more similar to Alpines Pure Hoppiness. Nicely bitter, but not crushingly so, balanced as hell. Just a tremendous brew, surely equal to anything brewed anywhere that's a DIPA. It this was easily available I'd be 300 lbs."

"Joe you are the man and thank you for this one. alright from notes i reviewed this one at a christmas party, which i ran away to a dark corner to review like a zero. have to start off with the awesome can, silver and black tall boy with the alchemist on the front lovin life. pours a deep transparent amber with a big off white head and it shows great retention. solid in the nostrils very citrusy with light pine and lemon peel dryness. very fresh hops and minimal malt sweetness, pale and biscuty. the taste is absolute cash, very fresh hop resin, again the citrus peel with an amazing bitterness that cuts the palate. bone dry finish. medium bodied and lightly carbonated and flows really easy without any """spiking""" to my surprise. this is the one that will make your gf not want to kiss you, the one where your breath still reeks of hops the next morning. flying hop dragons punching babies, can't stop em'. what a brew!"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel, it's a satisfying brew for my palate. Very good stuff."
""
"The only flaw: they need bigger cans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden orange with a head that is thick and fluffy and retains. Aroma of bold citric and piney hops that is in your face in a good way, generous malts to back it up. Taste follows nose, so good so amazing. Smooth and easy to drink, I love this beer, it will perpetually stay in my wants!"

"O – This brew is delicious. Tons of hops with some slight bread notes but definitely a hop heads dream. Might not be as balanced as other highly rated DIPAS (Abrasive, Pliny, Citra) but that’s ok for this hop head. This is a very flavorful brew with tons of hops and great bitterness. (5.0)"
""
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O: Hand down best IPA I have ever had. Previous IPA World Champion went to Pliny E/Flower Power but this just blows them away. All I gotta say is MOAR!!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Best beer I have ever enjoyed straight from a can, and one of the better ones I've had period. I've had Pliny this fresh and they are both phenomenal in their own regards."
""
"Overall this IPA is a must have and will definately acquire this again. It is an IPA that you can just sit back and enjoy every small sip of it."

"O: One of the best DIPA’s in the world. Definitely top 5. Love the flavors in this. Every bit as good out of the can than the bottle. If I lived near where this beer is distributed, I would always keep my fridge stocked at all times."
""
"Cost: $12 for a four pack."
""
""
"Well, it's an IPA, and it's a good one."

"O- Very happy I got the chance to try this. Certainly a must have for any true hophead."
""
""
""
""
"Why try and reinvent the wheel when you can just mimic it and do a damn fine job doing it?"
"O- This is just amazing. When I first saw the can in my box, I was super excited to try this but was a little nervous after I did not see a canning date, but after smelling it I knew it had to be fresh. Right up there with Pliny The Elder, worth seeking out, and I will be search for this more and more."
""
""
""
"O - By far, I can't recommend any beer more than this. If you can ever get this you are doing a disservice to yourself by not tasting this fantastic concoction. It's like drinking the nectar of the gods. Seriously, that good. I must say, though, that this is fantastic when fresh, but if you don't have it fresh it's not nearly as good. Over my dozen cans, the beer fell off after a couple of weeks. Silly me drank them over 3 weeks. The first week it was a religious experience, and by the last one it was only as good as any other world class DIPA. You could probably age this and it'd be great, but do drink fresh if you can. Giving it a 5/5 because it is tops on my list. If something dethrones this, I'll knock it down a notch. For now, this is as close to perfect as a DIPA can get in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall: This is an amazing IIPA. I wish it was more readily available!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O - A superb DIPA, almost exactly what I look for in the style. Insanely drinkable, this would get dangerous if I had regular access to it!"
""
""
"O - Overall this stuff is dangerous. These tallboys go back so easy its easy to lose track. The price too...my goodness, under $4 a can! Stuff is just delicious. Well worth getting."
""
""
""
""
"O - a stellar DIPA worth all the hype. i was leery about this as I've been a bit burned out by hops lately, but this delivired and ten some. the real magic here is the myriad of hop flavors taking turns, and absolutely INSANE drinkability. this can is going wayyy too fast. must. get. more."
"I've drank tons of this stuff from glasses and cans alike, and I haven’t noticee an appreciable difference. No matter how I drink it though, Heady Topper is absolutely a world-class IIPA. This is a beer that is worth seeking out, and I could probably drink it by the case. It doesn’t have a touch of alcohol to it, and the bitterness isn’t excessively harsh at any point."
"O: This is one of the best DIPAs out there, and firmly settles the case that canning vs bottling has no effect on the flavor. Absolutely delicious"
"Overall: The drinkability is out of the world. My brother and I enjoyed every aspect of this brew. The smell and taste were phenomonal! Would love to get a direct line to this. Cheers!"

"O) This beer is outrageous...would like to spend a lifetime of deciding which I liked better...this or PTE."
""
"In short, the Kimmichs reported that after Hurricane Irene, their goal was to brew one beer perfectly. In doing so, they have set the gold standard for what a DIPA should be."
""
""
""
""
"I make a long road trip every month to the alchemist for this beer. It is my absolute favorite DIPA right now...no question about it."
""
""
""
"O: Incredibly impressed. Beers with this much hype don't usually live up to it and my oh my did this one. Now I just need more.."
""
""
""
""
""
"For me this is the best Dipa I've ever had. Period. It's just that good. I'm still getting used to drinking it out of the can, what somewhat takes the """appearance""" note away, but I'm really sticking my nose in there, and have to keep myself from a binge-drinking session. Drinking this is just a wonderful walk in Dipa park... so complex it's scary, the finish is lingering, time stands still after you finish a can. Only prison can keep you from opening a next one... They've been canned a bit more than a week ago, and for the first time I don't think I'll have any problem finishing the next 14 cans within a week... might share a couple, but not too many!"
""
""
""
"O: Lives up to the hype. Awesome DIPA, wish I could have access to this all of the time. Could easily drink this beer for the rest of my life and be happy."
""
""
"I find I had a preconceived notion on what it was going to be. Pure greatness. Well, it isn't. It's damn good but not as much so as the hype train says. I'm trying not to have a mind explosion right now. All hail the king of imperial, Abrasive from Surly."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've now had this guy on draft, in the can, and out of the can. Any way you take it, it's an amazing beer. I do feel that straight from the can had a bit more hoppy flavor, but pouring it gives you the killer nose plus the ability to see the beer. Net-net I'll probably go with what I'm feeling at the time."
""
""
""
""
"o - is it homerism? maybe, but I think this is about as good as it gets. definitely right up there in drinkability and quality with fresh pliny on tap. is it better from a can? maybe, certainly doesn't get worse, but figured it was worth reviewing out of the glass. simply amazing and i'm so lucky to have this so readily available."
""
""
"Awesome representation of pine resin with notes of grapefruit and pineapple, with a softer graham cracker like sweetness. A top 10 beer right now that lives up to the hype in my opinion. Glad they have made this one more accessible."
"O-Really great. Top notch. If they can start producing enough of this to get it outside of Vermont it could become formidable competition for Pliny or any of the other highly regarded West Coast hoppy beers."

"This beer is legit, living up to the hype I wish that I had easier access so I could add it to my regular rotation."
"O/D - I had heard alot about this beer and read outstanding reviews. In my opinion it really lived up the hype. I was able to savor a four pack. Too bad it's not easier to get because I will always want this beer."
""
"O: A fantastic beer - world class DIPA. Extremely happy that I had the chance to try it and I will never turn it down. I probably will seek this out a few times a year for the fact that it's freaking delicious."

""
""
"Notes: A ton of thanks to matador677 for hooking me up with this taste treat."
""
"While not as sticky or resinous as other DIPAs, the nearly perfect carbonation level makes this an extremely enjoyable beer to drink. One of the most enjoyable """new""" DIPAs that I have had in a long time!"

"D: Certainly a very, very good Dipa , looking forward to my next can -:)"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is a fine IPA. Well-balanced, hits the right notes, and has a nose that rivals any out there. An overly-bitter finish holds it back, but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from picking this one up."

"I am glad i got to try it."
"This is my third different time reviewing this beer and it still holds up even here in packaged form. I still feel that it shows just a tad too much alcohol to really go the full monty on the style for me but there is no doubt that this is a DAMN great DIPA. The fact that this beer is now available in cans is just mind-boggling to me. I see many more of these in my future."

""
""

"This is a damn fine DIPA that is scary drinkable. The 8% is unnoticeable. I find this to be on the Mt. Rushmore of DIPA's that I have been able to try. It is not as clean and refined as PtY, but rather brash and in your face. Which, is both good and bad."

"lives up to the hype. better then pliny? yeah, maybe a little but they're both so delicious that i don't even care about that comparison. get this beer if you can!"

"Flavor is brief caramel and then all hops with grass, pine sap and some citrus notes mixing together nicely creating a complex hop profile not just overassertive bitterness. Very nice hop mix for a tasty and interesting beer, I was slightly doubtful after so much hype, but this beer lived up to the stories told about it. A nice American double IPA."

"Bitterish hops and toasted malt up front quickly give way to huge tropical fruit hop flavors. Fresh, juicy, luscious mangoes, pineapple, and mandarin orange. Resinous, slightly sappy, oily hop flavors hideout underneath and show up toward the finish. Sweetish, honeyish, fruity malt blends in nicely with the fresh hop wonder wall. Dries out in the finish with lots of lingering tropical fruit hop flavors. Moderately bitter, but mostly just flavorful. Medium-full body with a thickish, chewy feel. Half a case in, and whether straight from the can or poured into a glass this beer just keeps wowing me. World class."
""
""
""
"Huge thanks to Matt for the cans. You are truly a beautiful human being."
"O- I gave this 4.5 across the board. Smell could be a bit higher, but I wasn't willing to give it a 5, taste could be slightly lower, but not a 4. This is a damn, damn good beer."
"Big thanks to gtreid for sendin me home after our tasting with a can of this! Pours a clear honey orange color first followed by all the yeast towards the bottom of the can. The floaties are everywhere! Looks like a gelatin almost. Smells like a tropical Christmas tree - big pine sap, pineapple, mango, and sweet malts. Hop bomb from the get go, but not so bitter, just really delicious citrus hop characters. Not incredibly complex, but just brewed to near perfection. This has to be my favorite DIPA next to Pliny the Elder. If you haven't had it, you've got to get some."
"O: a fantastic beer"
"Longtime reader first time reviewer, not that I need to. The jury is already in on this beer. As a die hard IPA/DIPA chasing the latest and greatest available to me I just have to say this beer is a double edge sword. This IPA is so fantastic, that if it is not readily available to you and you are a diehard hophead I and others I know would nearly recommend not trying this beer and especially if you do not have more than a couple in your possesion. This beer has nearly ruined many other IPAs and DIPAs for me, I still enjoy them, but this has clearly set the standard. Also, I truly agree, do drink from the can, it is better than in a glass. I look forward to my first from a tap though. Warning over, onto my brief review. This beer bursts with grapefruit, citrus, lemon? white fruit and some very clean pine. Just amazing flavors that seem to change as you go through the can. The malt backbone is right where Ilike it in a beer of this strength. Its subtle but full arriving just before the fruit of the hops set in and leaves just in time for the bitterness to take over and make you want more. I try to limit myself to one of these per session so that it remains so special. As a last note, I do not know what hops are in this beer but I think columbus and cascade are here, for all I know there are many more."
"Overall: Not as good as when I had it on tap at the Alchemist, but pretty damn close. Everything about this beer is essentially perfect."
"I can't believe it's been over two years since the last time I got to drink Heady. This can was a long time coming. Pours a brilliant golden orange with a mad amount of hop floaties (the only part of the beer I wasn't thrilled with). Aroma is out of this world. My favorite kind of red grapefruit juice and tropical fruit candy. Flavor matches the nose in a pretty straight forward but completely complementing way. It's a whole mouth filling fruit forward hop flavor that I really dug. The slightly viscosity of the liquid was very nice in the mouth and carried the flavor well. Overall I'm just thrilled. Good show."
"I'm not sure if drinking it from the can really makes that big of difference or maybe I was just suffering from seasonal depression last night. At any rate, this is a top notch IPA that's certainly worth seeking out and that I'm glad I got the chance to try. Thanks again Nate."
"Can from Dr Greg - grazie amigo! Shared with buds. Poured a cloudy orange with a decent white head Nose is lemon / grapefruit citrusy and huge on the hops. Taste is slippery sweet and well integrated among the hop resins and citrus / fruit flavors. Finished off with a nice bitterness and soft bite. The lasting finish is well balanced. Loved this one."
"Tall boy can poured into a wine glass. Appearance is orange, honey with a good sized head. Its` nose has resin, pine, grapefruit and hops. The smell is most certainly an inviting one. Upon sipping this, I taste more of the pine and resin, citrus aspects are still there, along with a good amount of hops. The hops are well balanced and it finishes with a fair amount of bitterness. With everything in mind, this is a great drinking DIPA and gets accolades with reason."
"woah. orange-amber with a slight haze. off-white head with good retention and pretty lace. nose is grapefruit, orange, blood-orange, pineapple, mango, papaya, passionfrut, piney tropicalness harmonized near-perfectly with a caramel graininess that simply rocks. taste is all of the above with the perfect amount of bitter/dry to balance. this is as heady as it comes. yes, I said heady. bitter in the finish with pine singing, but tropical fruitiness lingering. all good things about hops are here amplified by all good things about malty harmony. thick, yet light and fluffy. fanf'ingtastic. thanks al. and alchemist."
"O: Unbelievably drinkable beer that was an experience, not simply a beer. I truly enjoyed Heady Topper."
"Overall:This is one of the best DIPAs that I have had. It has a great complexity of delicious flavors."
"Overall - I am not lying when i say this is probably the best DIPA /IPA i have ever drank, it deserves the hype and i think its a great experience to beer geeks a like to test their palate in and out of the can. I can't wait for this beer to be distributed. The east coasts Pliny that i can see in the future giving it a run for its money."
"Overall: Amazing beer, definitely world class."
"Oh, a beer amongst beers! The Alchemist has done a great justice to the world with the Heady Topper. I've rarely seen a better looking DIPA, smelled a finer flower, nor tasted anything as hoppy and honeyed. I'm not sure what kind of black magic this brewery dabbles in, but this beer is a incantatory balance of hop and malt. It's sweet (but just right), it's hoppy and piney, resin-y, and brilliantly citrus-y. If I ever have an imperial IPA better than this, I might just call it the best I could ever have. I'm serious."
"Overall: My favorite beer I've ever had. It's the perfect beer. I wish I had started reviewing a few months before so that I could have reviewed the ones I had on tap. Regardless though, this beer is spectacular. The best."
"Overall a great example of the style and real enjoyable, too bad my chances of trying this again are going to be slim in this area. Except when I head to Vermont! May not be my ultimate favorite but it is one dam good beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with great carbonation. Medium bodied. This ends up being an extremely drinkable hop monster of a beer. Go ahead and drink this one from the can. Well worth seeking out if you're a hop lover. I'm really happy to have had the opportunity to try this. I have to get to Vermont one day!"
"O - Very nice IPA. I had no problem finishing my glass and I was left wanting more. The balance of juicy fruit and grassy hops to the slightly sweet malt is very nice. I hope to try this one on-tap some day soon."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a fantastic beer, I loved the bright, juicy hoppiness. It had a great range of flavors to it and was very drinkable. Great beer overall."
"Cheers!"
"O - Very, very solid DIPA. Amazing how smooth yet bitter finish this beer delivers. Right up there with fresh PtE but a bit sweeter."
"O - Flat out delicious! I definitely look forward to having some more of this."
"Heady Topper, this one was a long time coming and did not disappoint. Just as good as any DIPA I have ever had, perhaps the most enjoyable beer I have come across. Flavors is bright and clean. Drinkability is off the charts, there is no sign of the 8% ABV. This is one I will seek out on a regular occasion, would be a daily drinker if I lived close enough."
"Overall I must say that I have really laid into the North Eastern folk for asking the world in trade for this, now, year round offering. It is quite fantastic beer and almost equal to Abrasive, but not worth a bomber of Canadian Breakfast Stout. I received this as an extra from a Midwestern trader. Thanks TIMMYJ21 for not being as stingy as the NE guys."
"O- Very well done! Perhaps not a session ale but I could do damage in an evening if this was easily available."
"the hype is deserved!!"
"Good carbonation and a medium finish with a lingering aftertaste full of complex notes, not just overwhelming bitterness. Everything is very balanced and totally delicious."
"Very tasty beer.  Thanks to GoGriz for the hookup with the fresh cans.  I would definitely recommend and seek out again. "
"Overall this is indeed a unique beer. Extremely, dangerously drinkable and clean - I taste no alcohol at all. Tastes basically like grapefruit juice, feels a bit like getting your mouth scoured out by pure hop extract. This is as close to hop mouthwash as I ever want to go - but in a good way."
"O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, great representation of style. I highly enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"Medium bodied with average carbonation and a bitter grapefruit zest aftertaste. A very nice DIPA which I like a lot. I would buy this fairly regularly if available in MN."
"O- I was assured this was fresh...with no dating, I can't be sure. It's still good, but is it world class? Not in this state, it's not"
"Will seek this beer often, good thing I have a regular hook up for it or I do believe I would go into withdrawels."
"Fantastic DIPA. So grateful I got to try this one."
"What a sexy lookin can we have here. Heady Topper pours an electric yellow/orange color with a small white head. Tons of aromatic goodness booming from the glass. Resinous pine, grapefruit and tropical fruits in the taste with an amazingly balanced malt profile. This beer was unreal, and completely worth the hype around it, try it if you can."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this beer is exactly what you look for in a 2IPA and is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Overall a very good D/IPA that I would drink often if available to me."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick and sticky and the carbonation level is moderate, right where it should be for this kind of beer. Overall, this is really a spectacular DIPA and is deserving of it's lofty reputation."
"Drink- Kevin, I can't say enough about this beer. Thank you so much for having an extra for me. I would love to have more of this beer for sure."
"O: This is an outstanding beer. Great nose, great flavor, and great balance. Right on par with Hopslam as the best dipa's I've had. I am very fortunate to have a couple more cans.Excellent! Skal."
"Went against the recommendation and poured this puppy up. Deep caramel orange enhanced haziness from hop residues. Immediately the smell is a citrus bomb. This beer combines so many great citrus notes. It is as if the fruit is from some hybrid tree that only grows in Vermont. I would say the grapefruit is the star though. Crisp taste with some tangy bites. Very fresh hop notes. The mouth feel is almost as impressive as the taste. This is almost described as creamy to my palate. Overall this is the best IPA I have tasted."
"O- So great. Its not a complete palate wrecker, but instead a decent palate tenderizer. One of the top DIPAs I've had and would love to have again and again and again..."
"Pours orange with a fluffy white head. Nose is bursting with oily hops, orange candy, pine resin. Sticky and delightful. Flavor is a collage of brightly bitter hops, grapefruit rind, orange rock sugar. Finish is long and grapefruity. Very nice stuff."
"The taste of this beer is god nectar. It's a wonderful beer that is so balanced between bitterness and refreshing. There are flavors I haven't experienced in any beer. It's complex. I pull the citrus immediately and just a touch of booziness comes across the palate with the initial swill. The booze quickly dissipates and hops take over. I couldn't tell you what hops are used, why they are used, or what characteristics they impart on this beer but I can tell you that the mix is right and this beer is delicious. I want more of them and I want them now. The best way to describe this beer is fresh and unique. Maybe I got caught up in the hype machine a bit one this one but I think it's easily surpased to my expectations."
"O-Heady topper is amazing. It shows that to be a fantastic dipa you do not have to hop the hell out of it. This beer is just delicious. I had it out of a glass the first time and did not enjoy it as much but now out of a can...fantastic. It may be a bit overhyped but frankly there are not many dipas better than it."
"Overall a good time but I feel that the smoke flavor that comes through is a but odd."
"O - I wish I lived in Vermont. This truly is world class. I'm an emotional rollercoaster right now. I'm so happy because I have 3 more of these, yet I'm so sad I only have 3 more of these. Soooo good."
"O - I'm not sure how I would rate it in comparison to having it on-tap, but still very good. Nice flows with the flavors, nice balance overall."
"Overall; I absolutely love this beer, will be seeking more of it out and can't wait until they start distributing in states that I visit ofter. This is definitely everything that it was said to be, if not more and is the East Coast's answer to Pliny/Sculpin!"
"D: This is a really, really tasty and really well balanced DIPA.  Like the can says, it's not the most hoppy, but it's really tasty and really well balanced.  A real treat to get to try this and one that can stand up to some of the best from out west.  I look forward to getting a few more cans down the road."
"Cheers..."
"O: Great! Worth searching out if you haven't. Hope you're lucky enough to try-"
"1, 4.5, 5, 5, 5"
" I wouldn't mind drinking this a little more often. Near the top of the IPA food chain. Its a great feeling when hype delivers!"
"D: It's 8% so it's not exactly an all day drinker. That said, I would drink it all day if I could."
"This is a darn good beer. Heavy on the hops, but dominated by what I call the positive hop characteristics - pine, citrus, and floral. Up there with Surly Abrasive as one of my favorite DIPAs. Really freaking good all around, and probably the best example I've encountered for showcasing pine hops on top of a bed of others."
"O- Really impressed, been waiting a while to try this one and I was not let down. So tasty and well balanced, hop bomb but not too over the top, one of the best DIPAs I have had the privilege to enjoy."
"This is perfect camping/skiing beer, I wish I could get it regularly. I poor a small amount into my half-pint glass just to study the appearance, but quickly decide that the brewer is right, this beer is meant to be enjoyed out of the can..."
"Smelled of big-n-juicy hops, tropical fruits and resinous pine. Very floral and fragrant. Taste was malty sweet up front, with much of the same fruity notes found in the nose. Body was medium+, with a soft but adequate amount carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a tasty East Cast DIPA."
"This is a keeper and one that all hopheads should seek. The standard for DIPAs. Now you can argue that Hopslam is sweeter, but really, for those that crave the hops and all of its glorious characteristics, this is the one. And in a can. The debate is dead."
"Mouthfeel is crisp through and through, the carbonation dancing off the tongue, and finishes a touch dry, leaving one wanting for another sip. Overall, a phenomenal DIPA that is truly deserving of its “world-class” status. Do not hesitate to seek out this one if given the opportunity."
"This is a good quality DIPA from a fine brewery. While the pub is being reconstructed, this is the only way to have their beers. If you have a chance to pick some up while in Vermont, you should, but I'd also suggest seeking out some Hill Farmstead Galaxy, another great DIPA from the region (of course, HF doesn't come in a convenient can form, so stock up on Heady to bring home)."
"O: Awesome beer. Tons of flavor and it really lingers in your mouth for a while. Glad I got some more of these guys!"
"O: A new bar has been set for DIPAs."
"O - this is the best double ipa i've had to date and was very much worth the visit up north. can't wait to be able to get this in the store on a regular basis."
"4.0 D: Solid brew, though I'm not huge on bready DIPAs. Still, I'd have no problem putting down a few of these."
"Overall very enjoyable, Cheers to a great trader sending great extras."
"Overall, just a fantastic beer. Piney and hoppy with plenty of up-front bitterness, without the lingering dryness you'll get from a west-coast style DIPA. Moreover, while there's an evident abundance of malt, it is not so sweet as to completely kill the spiciness of the hops. What a well balanced brew from The Alchemist!"
"I've thought this was the best IPA made on the East Coast I've had when I first had it at the brewpub a year ago, and now that its in cans I still feel that way. Really glad I bought a whole case at the cannery. I also was surprised to find that it's a bit better out of the can."
"o - overall, a winner. wish this was readily available to me. would love to try it as fresh as it can get. quite nice from the can or the glass and one that i'd happily swig from the can."
"Traded big for this one - a '11 DL for a four pack of this delicious stuff. Glad the brewery decided to can this beer! Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. There is a bitterness finish, but it is pleasant, aromatic and not harsh at all. Tried this out of a can, but ended up too dangerously drinkable that way."
"Overall, this is still an elite DIPA but having this right after Bad Boy did not help its case. Medium drinkability with the odd aftertaste but still up there near the top of the DIPA mountain."
"O: a very pleaseant beer, i loved the aromatic components of this beer there is so much going on at different temperatures of this drink. the hop presence is there but not in the taste did not give me the hop bite that im used to in most ipas, would have given this a higher rating if this quality was present. overall a great beer would purchase this quite often if it was available in So Cal"
"A big, big THANKS to Damico for this can share. Pours a cloudy orange amber color with a nice white foam head. Aroma of grapefruit and earthiness, with some caramel mixed in. Has a sweet caramel taste with ridiculously perfect dank hop resiny hit. Smooth as can be. The harsh hop hit does not outlast the finish, leaving you with delicate grapefruit notes at the end of this perfection. Not overhyped."
"Update: After a 1 for 1 comparison the next day, this beer edges Dreadnaught. And for the value, it blows it out of the water."
"Frankly, there really isn't much to dislike with Heady Topper. When my biggest gripe is for the brewery to put a born-on date stamp on their can... they must be onto something. This isn't the absolute best DIPA I've had, nor the biggest, or booziest, or weirdest... but it is certainly one of the most balanced and, for what it is, flawless. Sigh... guess I gotta get more."
"Overall just friggen awesome. So far the best IPA on this side of the Mississippi, and probably best I've every had. So full of awesome hops, tropical fruits of all shapes and sizes, citrus orange rind, a bit of musty resinous hop, and all that with a nice big malty balance that takes the way back seat and still lets the hops take the show. A nice dry and clean finish that lingers forever. All that and it comes in a can, I mean who doesn't like it in the can. If I could get this all the time..."
"O: A great brew, what else can I say."
"O - A top notch DIPA. Really glad I've got three more of these in my fridge. Definitely seek this one out."
"Very solid & refreshing. Bonus points for being fresh."
"O: Lives up to the hype surrounding it. Could drink this beer all day everyday."
"An aromatic wave of dank pine and citrus hops emerge immediately upon cracking the can open. Pours a fairly dark, dull copper/orange. Cloudy and thick with a thick cream colored head. Clumpy streaks of lacing and a thin retentive layer of bubbles throughout. Sweet, juicy, ripe aroma of grapefruit and pineapple, with grass, pine and citrus rind balancing out the profile. Thicker side of medium body, chewy and oily on the palate with a resiny and pulpy finish. Strong bready malt body hides underneath the rich, fresh, intense hop flavor. Much more resiny and pulpy than the aroma, grapefruit and pine flavors dominate. Finish is dry and remarkably smooth. Just about perfect, this is a miracle in a readily available can."
"Overall: Really good. Would have liked the flavor to measure up to the aroma but you still can't go wrong with this one."
"Overall this beer eats Pliny the Elder's lunch. I would take this 10 times out of 10 over it's west coast comparative beer. It is just so damn delicious it's crazy. I may have to move to Vermont in the near future. It also scores extra point for coming in a 16 oz can which is by far the best packaging around. My new philosophy is 6 pack 12 oz bottles need to go away and 4 pack 16 oz cans need to take over; it just makes way too much sense on so many levels. Nice tangent there, anyway this is the best DIPA I have ever had, worth seeking out and highly recommended. I hope all is well and things get back on track because their brewery was damaged during Hurricane Irene and I know they had to shut down for a while. Let's hope all is returned to normal soon so they can continue to churn out stellar beers like this."
"O - Overall I would say the beer is surprisingly great to drink directly from the can. I would still recommend pouring it, but it is really awesome from the can as well. I have matched my scores to a previous review in order to minimize allowing this review to impact the overall score"
"Overall - I don't get the hype for this beer - actually for all the Vermont DIPAs. Not a bad beer, but certainly not world class."
"Overall: This has a strong, pleasant bitterness, with the hop flavors taking a backseat. Good, but I don't see how it really differentiates itself from the top notch DIPA's."
"Lives up to the hype. Wish I could drink this all the time."
"This is one of those beers that makes you want to quit tasting beers, and just drink a whole lot of beers."
"No hint of the higher ABV; easy-drinking and tasty for sure. Enjoyed this beer but found it a little too sweet and malt-forward for my tastes (maybe I prefer the hoppier West Coast DIPA's?)."
"D - An outstanding American Double IPA... Well crafted artisan brew... Loaded with both complexity and character... The appearance and aroma really didn't live up to my lofty expectations, but everything from there on out more than impressed..."
"Fine creation in brewing..Every self respecting BA should pick up a case of this nectar everytime they find themselves in the general area of the cannery."
"Overall this is the best DIPA and best beer I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy! Every sip is filled with amazing hoppy goodness! I would make the 6 hour trip to Waterbury every month if I could, just for this beer! Thanks to the folks at The Alchemist cannery for being friendly awesome people and for making this truly wonderful beer!"
"Finally! A hyped beer that did not disappoint! Better than Pliny? Firstly, who cares. But also yes, it's made on the East Coast!"
"I have to say, I sipped this from the can and a glass, I preferred the glass because I could pick up the aromas better."
"My expectations for DIPA's were raised the other day after having Ephraim, but this one put up a good fight with it. Very glad I got to try this and I'm happy this happened to fall on my 100th review. Thanks again cookie!"
"This one pours a muddied and cloudy dark gold in color with a soapy white head that clings to the rim of my snifter. The nose is phenomenal. You get a lot of grapefruit, pineapple, citrus fruits, with a light malty sweetness. It is very pungent and very, very aromatic. The flavors too are a combination of grapefruit and pineapple with a moderate amount of bitterness and a clean finish. It's just so intensely hoppy. Like the description says, it is wave after wave of hoppy goodness. It drinks well, both from a glass or out of the can. It's just a really nice beer through and through. I'm really glad I got to try this one."
"Pours a hazed golden amber color with good cap of soapy white bubbles, good retention and lacing. Scent hits the nose with a big rush of tropical and citrus fruits... grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange... slight presence of malt, finishes with a hint of grass. Taste starts off with a quick little bitter punch but quickly moves into a cocktail of tropical fruit with light citrus, again a faint presence of malt and a grassy and piney note at the end. Medium bodied, good carbonation, lacking some oily body preferred in the style. Overall, fantastic scent and taste make this beer highly drinkable and a great IPA."
"Overall this is an amazing IPA that I think is one of the best of the style and actually lived up to the hype. I wish this was easier to get here in WA"
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is simply great. Real tough to beat here. Glad to see these guys canning this guy regularly now."
"Overall: Hands down deserves the hype it's received. I've had this out of a can and bottle so far and I haven't been let down."
"Pours a hazy orange/copper with a nice white head. The nose is a combination of tropical fruit and pine smell that comes together in a very encouraging and welcoming fashion. The hop flavor combination is unusual in that it almost combines into the suggestion of a light mint tea. The taste is that same killer combination of tropical and pine flavors, and a good background malt base that is in balance with the hops. Lighter in body and sweetness than some DIPAs, but not dry, this achieves a good balance. Good carbonation. This is a really good DIPA and another to add to the list of 'must trys' for the hop head. Not brutally bitter, but a fantastically interesting hop flavor. Had this right after Hill Farmstead Double Citra and they were right on par with each other and fairly similar."
"O - This is the best DIPA I've ever had. It is all that anyone could want this style to deliver. The statement on the can sums this beer up perfectly..."""Not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate""". I like this beer better than Pliny the Elder, but that might be because I had this beer fresh from the brewery whereas I had Pliny a couple of months after it was bottled."
"I tried one from the glass (the basis for this review) and one from the can (as it says to do) and honestly, I liked the one from the can better. Maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me because that's how the brewers wanted it but I usually never drink from the can unless I have no choice."
"Overall heady topper is everything I had hoped it would be. In my opinion it lives up to the hype and is certainly one of the best doubles I have had to date. The hop flavors and drinkability are amazing. I wish I could get this on a regular basis but I can't so it looks like I will be trading more often. If you like the hops do not miss this brew because its exceptional. Thanks again Adam and Dan, I owe you both!"
"O: Amazing aroma & captivating appearance. This is truly an experience that any hop lover should seek. Huge thanks to DaveHack for helping me cross this off my list & for the awesome glass."
"O: Yeah, easily the best DIPA I've had in a long time. Huge aroma, even bigger flavor, not overly dry or over carbonated or too heavy or boozy. More and more I'm liking DIPA's to be in the 8.0% to 9.0% range, because the hops seem to get lost in the huge amount of malt it takes to push a beer over that 9.0% threshold, this beer hits everything right on. Great beer, completely worth the hype."
"O - A very enjoyable DIPA. Surprisingly easy to drink for a relatively big beer. The hops grab you from the first sip and do not let go. Definitely worthy of the attention it receives and would never turn down more!"
"Fantastic beer. Not the very best of the style I've had, but right up there."
"*Also better canned than on draft."
"Pours a vibrant burnt apricot with a white frothy head. Moderate lacing decorates the glass as I continue to guzzle this baby down. Smells of citrus fruits, grapefruit, and malt. Piney hops I was looking for seem to be mellowed down quite a bit in the nose. Taste is very smooth, pretty much zero bitterness whatsoever. Hops (thank goodness) makes its appearance as the beer rolls around my tongue. I was tempted to call in a search party to look for any bitterness from the hops, but it appears it will just remain on the missing persons report. Mouthfeel is quite impressive. Overall, it's a good DIPA. However, I have had better."
"D: Such a lovely, flavorful beer. Hops are forefront but kept in check by an underlying malt base. A must try"
"This is top notch. I can't wait for my ski trip in January to stock up."
"Overall, the beer is just great. It smells freakin' awesome and tastes excellent. The alcohol is really hidden in this gem. By all means get this beer and consume!"
"Glad I got to try this, I am often let down by hype, but this one is delicious and worth tracking down."
"O: A very good, quite tasty, hop-forward IIPA."
"O- An awesome DIPA. Very smooth in the body, yet completely hop forward. Top notch. Completely worthy of being my side beer as I brew my first batch tonight (Nobel Trappist ale). Will need to get more of this beer."
"O: A perfect example of how a DIPA should be. Really glad I got an opportunity to try this."
"Oh and I am going to be a D-bag and not recycle this can because I'm saving it. Love it."
"Appearance: it was out of the can like they recommend, but I gave it a 5 because I love the can art."
"Glad to have the chance to try and will definitely be seeking out again. Highly recommended. A contender with Abrasive for sure."
"O- Extremely drinkable with a great aroma. The only issue I had was that it was a little less complex in the taste and a little malty, but a fantastic DIPA that can compete with the best."
"Heady Topper lives up to its reputation, and I love that The Alchemist has devoted an entire facility to making and canning it. If I lived close, it'd be hard to justify buying much else at $12/4 pack. An elegant and supremely balanced DIPA."
"HV"
"D - Not as kick ass as I was expecting, but a great beer!"
"O- well worth the wait and the hype. This is a damn good beer"
"I'm getting a chance to revisit this right after drinking a Pliny, and boy, is it still glorious. It looks cloudy and ugly, though, so I'm docking the appearance down by 0.5. can is fresher, so the nose is more pungent and more dank, hiding the caramel sweetness. I'm upping the nose to a 4.5. The palate is just a hair too sweet, and the more I drink, the less I enjoy it, and I'm dropping the taste to 4.5. Just a touch boozy, too. Still, a fantastic DIPA."
"O: I like this better than Hopslam. Yeah I said it. But for real, a beer available in cans all the time with this much going on? What more could you ask for???!!"
"This pours a deep copper color with a nice retaining head that lines the glass. The pour is very hazy but appealing. Smells of huge citrus fruits including oranges, pineapples and melons. Some earthy smells come through with pine needles. Nice hop presence as well on the nose. Taste is very sweet up front with a delicious hop finish that balances on the palate. Very enjoyable tasting beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is amazing. Very drinkable DIPA with 8% and the taste is amazing. Thanks again Scotty!"
"O - an excellent example of the style, very well done."
"O: A beer for sure bordering on A+. Still love Furious and Abrasive more, but this runs right up there with them as the King of the Cans."
"Note - When you look at a can of Heady Topper it might be hard not to notice that the can actually reads along the top, """DRINK FROM THE CAN""". The back of the can explains the reasoning behind this and I can honestly say that it tastes fantastic poured into a glass or straight from the can. This is an absolutely amazing beer any way you enjoy it."
"Cheers again VG - you know I am not a hop-whore, but this one is out of this world."
"Overall, a near perfect DIPA. That's really nothing bad I can say about it. It was even better on a fresh palate. Another great IPA from Vermont that's affordable and so damn tasty."
"this is what I was hopin SN hoptimum was going to be like, a bigger badder celebration which is exactly what this guy is. deserves the attention. I never thought I'd get a chance at this guy. thanks gueshue for the chance!"
"Overall a great east coast DIPA."
"Can Art work is neato to boot."
"Thanks Spence. Pint Can. Super haxzy orange ameber with a medium sized white head. Nose is full of hop resin, some sweetness, citrus. Flavor is similarly super resinous, sweet, mild bitterness. Pretty tasty, alcohol slightly noticeable. This is a very good beer and if you like super resinous double ipa's than this is probably your thing. To me, it was a little too sweet and green and lacked complexity."
"This might very well be my favorite IPA so far. Balance, balance, balance. This one gives all aspects of the beer it's own moment. I love it and would like to have one of these at least once a week."
"O - A very nice DIPA. Fruit heavy, but very enjoyable."
"This is a very drinkable DIPA. One of the best"
"Lot's of citrus and grapefruit aroma and flavor. There are some definite earthy notes as well. When I poured the beer it was about cellar temp. Getting some definite resin feel on the mouth. Not overly carbonated and the abv is not too pronounced."
"Love this beer, glad I got 2 four-packs of this."
"Medium body with light carbonation contributing to a smooth velvety liquid that somehow coats your tongue while in the mouth, but still finishes cleanly so your tongue is ready to taste the next sip. Very easy to drink as the bitterness is not overwhelming at all, but still very much there. Excellent imperial IPA, though the weaker than expected aromatics knocks it down a small tick for me."
"O: Overall this beer is good but its lacking in taste department. Strong onion flavor dominates. Pretty smooth but seems to be a little one dimensional. Super stoked to try this though. 4.0"
"OVERALL: This beer is excellent. This rivals Surly Abrasive, both of which beat out the competition for no.1 spot. Piles of wonderful hoppy aroma and flavor that isn’t dominated by that certain overarching bitterness that so many big IPAs suffer from. This is all flavor, and wonderful flavor at that. The can employs me to drink this beer immediately because they are always making more. Good times! This is a perpetual wants list beer, as it totally lives up to its reputation. Thanks heaps GoGriz and tendermorsel for bringing us a couple cans of this gem. Wholeheartedly recommended."
"Just a well built beer. Keep cranking out those cans. I love this. Next trip to VT, I’ll be picking up a case."
"In my opinion it's fairly thick and full bodied. The carbonation level is perfect. Silky smooth from start to almost finish, clean crisp bitter finish. Leaves a long lasting warm feeling from your mouth to you're stomach. I generally like my IPAs/DIPAs in the summer, but I could drink this Bad Larry all year round!!! What a wonderful beer, lived up the the hype and then some for me!"
"Overall, this is an exceptional beer. Definitely in the upper echelon for the style. I'm not sure I've had a beer that has smelled as good as this, regardless of style. Dangerously drinkable for an 8% ABV beer. I'd love to have this one readily available to me."
"O - I had high expectations for this beer. It did not exceed them nor did it fall below them. It was GREAT, just as I suspected. World Class DIPA, just how I like them. It's a beer that belongs in the same discussions as the other overly Hyped ones and holds it's own. There are a few I prefer over HT but make no mistake about it...HT does not dissapoint. Need to revisit on tap."
"Cheers John!"
"O: Simply, this is an outstanding DIPA. One of the very best that I've had, and easily the best from the east coast I've had to date. This has the type of balance I long for in a DIPA, and it delivers in the flavor. Seemed to have more of a sweet character than I'd expect to find, but it's really balanced. Alcohol is perceivable, but it's well integrated. Outstanding from Alchemist"
"O: Heady is a solid IIPA indeed and extremely easy to drink"
"drinks sooo easy. i would NEVER guess this was 8%."
"Overall: I wouldn't change a thing. You're damn right I'm going to have it again."
"Additional comment (6/23/12): Well, I claimed I would buy cases, and I have been buying cases. But due to some unfortunate mistakes, I am currently drinking a 6-month old can. It's still good. The hops taste old, and it's sweeter, but it's still worth drinking. This is canned happiness."
"Buying this regurarly and it's still kick-ass"
"Can, thanks Seth! Hazy burnt orange pour with an off white head. Pine and citrus aromas. Outstanding balance, with smooth pine and resiny hop notes off set by a sturdy caramel malt backbone. Light citrus and floral undercurrents. Just a great freakin’ DIPA, and from a can. Kudos to the Alchemist Pub and Brewery..."
"The amazing resinous pine and floral notes makes this almost easily one of the greatest Imperial IPA's I've had the pleasure to drink! Guess I'm moving to Vermont!"
"O- Like the the can says, """So drinkable it's scary.""" It that is no lie. I could drink 3 or 4 of these over a a course of night, and not be tired of it at all. Love the aroma, taste, and lower abv (for a DIPA at least). Will try and get more whenever possible!"
"Overall: Great DIPA but on my side by side tasting Kern citra was the clear cut winner but this might be the second best DIPA I have ever had"
"Overall a very nice DIPA. The best I've ever had outside of Cali. IMO better than PtE and close to Alpine and Citra. Overall great nose, flavor and balance. Highly recommended."
"Overall: This is good, but it's not on the same level as the bottle I had in 2010. This seems much maltier and the hops aren't as vibrant. It's also a bit heavy on the palate due to the low carbonation."
"The dank note I got on the nose translates to a VERY strange hint of cedar chips/hamster cage substrate... It is a combination of the hops character blending with the dry malts. It hurts the overall and flavor a bit, but still doesn't make the beer undrinkable."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. If there's any malt in here I can't find it, but I really don't miss it because I could smell this all night. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Resinous dank pine hops barely let any malt come through, but some do find their way in. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. This one is all about the hops, no shit right its a DIPA. There is a bitterness here, but its pleasant, aromatic and not harsh. This is a damn fine beer!"
"Thanks Chris! Heady Topper pours out a hazy orange color, with just a small amount of white heading. Lively carbonation can be noticed, along with some sediment floating around. Very fruit forward nose, with passion fruit, pineapple, mango and a touch of sweet cream. Dank ass hops get things kicked off in the taste, giving off loads of fruit, spice and pine. Mouthfeel is medium in body, and the eight percent is masked perfectly. No doubt this is a world class IPA."
"Overall, this is up there with the best of them. I won't call it my all time best IIPA, but it is close. And so kickass that its in a can....I am going to try to do a trade for a full box of this soon."
"O: If I were to penalize this beer for anything it would be for being just too damn drinkable. I find myself sipping it all night, and completely enjoying it, with no regard for my liver. And in a way, it has ruined other DIPA's for me because I no longer want to try them, they just wont be this good."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. All in all this is the perfect package. The hop inclusion is bright, fresh and fruity. The alcohol is seemingly nonexistent until it comes up to temperature. The flavors of this brew run the full spectrum of hop characteristics. I killed a pint of this brew effortlessly. As far as drinkability goes, this is perfect and dangerously so. The label boasts that this should be drank from the can but I just cant do that. To not be able to sit and sniff this brew is a crime. I had this when it was first released from a bottle and thought this beer was all hype. Sitting here enjoying a can by myself I an throughly impressed. Fantastic stuff here Alchemist!"
"Overall: The fact that this is now available in cans is crazy. I had it on tap 3 years ago and wasn't impressed. Tastes change, but I hope this beer doesn't. A great testament to the style."
"O: My first beer from The Alchemist and hopefully the first of many. Heady Topper blends some of my favorite hops to produce an excellent and very drinkable American DIPA. Hard to believe that there is 8% in there somewhere. Since I tend to compare beers while I drink them, I immediately thought this beer was similar to Alpine Duet and Maine Beer Company Lunch in both smell and taste. I am looking forward to my next Heady Topper and planning an upcoming trip to VT."
"16oz. can served in my ST tulip (just couldn't bring myself to drink it out of the can). Pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with a rocky, one inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some swaths and spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer - grassy, sweet citrus, earthy rind and a slight peppery quality towards the back; incredibly well-balanced. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness presents up-front and sweet citrus and a suggestion of apricot follows. Finish leaves a slight residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation that is lively without being prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it. Hopefully it will make it to Southern Vermont so I can get a bit more regular access. This beer is nothing short of fantastic - the balance is top notch, the alcohol is well-hidden and it is just so easy drinking. In my opinion, can tops bottle on this brew."
"O: Great DIPA. Lives up to the hype. Would love for this to be available at the local store."
"This beer is exceptional and very deserving of the accolades that have come it's way so far. If I could get this locally, it would be a once-a-week purchase and I think a lot of people would think the same way. In this day and age of johnny-come-latelys and ticker mentalities, that really says something!"
"Additional Notes - The first can I opened was so full of sediment that I couldn't finish it. It looked like somebody had dumped sand into my glass. Pour carefully."
"This is an incredible beer, the best DIPA/IPA I have had in a long time and possibly ever."
"This rivals any DIPA I've ever tried..."
"O: Possibly the most drinkable DIPA that I have ever had, much more balanced than most DIPAs that are tipping the IBU scale. Packed from start to finish with delicious hops. I would have never guessed that this is 8% ABV. Extremely glad that I finally got the chance to try this one!"
"-Medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and wet on the tongue, lingering finish. Very drinkable, flavorful, and balanced. This is a DIPA for the ages."
"Overall: Cant wait to get my hands on a couple more cans."
"O- This is one amazing dipa. As the label says this is not the most bitter or most insanely dry-hopped dipa. It is however one of the best that I have ever had. The hop profile as I mentioned above is perfectly balanced. The hops are present from start to finish and each hop element has depth. A very awesome beer."
"O: It's unfair to cap this rating at 5. HT deserves a 6 (at least) for overall drinkability. Sublime and dangerous, as the alcohol is not really noticeable, and it comes in pint cans!"
"Left in the can this time, like the brewmaster suggested. Shared with a friend yesterday, poured a yellow orange with some fairly sticky white head, not it's strong suit. Smell is mango, pine, orange, & a little floral. The best smelling IPA ever, at this point. Taste is same, so perfect. My expectations were sky high and this beer delivered the goods. Mouthfeel wonderful & plenty carbonation. Best DIPA I have had, so easy to drink it is scary. Thanks to Bruce & Rick for leaving this on my porch, like a gift from God."
"This is the camping beer for a new breed of man. And so..we shall drink this on the moon next year."
"Got this beer as a gift from a friend. Canned less than 48 hours before, this beer had it going on! Nose was ripe with pine and a peach like citrus notes. The taste was pretty much the same. HT didn't have the usual very bitter finish of most IPAs. It finished rather subdued and dry, which made it quite drinkable. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy... lots of little bubbles. Truly a fantastic, world class, IPA. Looking forward to getting more of this gem."
"To me, this is the perfect beer - I love cans, especially tall boys, it's easy drinking, perhaps too easy because there is not even a hint that this is 8% for better or worse, and it's the best IPA I've ever had so now in a can, you just can't beat it!"
"O: This is easily one of the 3 best DIPAs I've ever had up there with Hill Farmstead Abner and Double Galaxy. It's pretty much as perfect as it gets."
"O- Fantastic DIPA! As if the trip through beautiful Vermont and New Hampshire wasn't enough, this beer is great. Good luck to the Alchemist Cannery, the future brewpub and the town of Waterbury that was hit incredibly hard by Irene. Great Job!"
"Notes: Amazing. Simply amazing. So glad to have the option to drink this at home! And I'm really happy for them that they have this """backup""" plan. I'll be sure to do (drink) my part!"
"Mouthfeel- great carbonation. Smooth and worth the drive."
"So flavorful, yet so drinkable!"
"This brew is amazing. I could drink it all day everyday. The only real draw back to this was the color, it just wasn't what I remembered from it on tap. Still amazing though. Glad I was able to drink and share several of these bottles last winter. Now I'm just waiting for those cans... Now that's a game changer. Damn."
"O - The best IPA I have had and a great endnote for my east coast beer trek. Worth the drive and something I hope to get once it is canned!"
"John's plan to can this beautiful beer for wider distribution is by far the best move by a small brewery in recent memory. Well played sir. Cheers!"
"Finally tried it from the can and the quality is still the best in the entire world. Heady is my perfect beer, regardless of its pouring median."
"O - for the high ABV, body and sweetness, thus is super drinkable. The hop flavor is incredible on the finish and I absolutely loved this beer."
"This beer is very complex, but surprisingly light and refreshing for its hoppiness"
"O: I'm glad I finally tried this beer, but for me it didn't really live up to the hype. It was good and I wish I'd noticed that it was on cask as I'd love to try that, but personally I think the Alchemist IPAs I've had--Rapture and Holy Cow--are better than Heady Topper. That said, I'd gladly order this again (especially for the bargain $4, which probably makes this the best IIPA I've had per dollar) and am looking forward to trying it from the can."
"Will def be going back for VBF next year and this is easily one of the reasons why."
"Lived up to every expectation. Excessively fresh & delicious."
"O: I would say this is the best DIPA I have had to date. I can't wait until the start canning this brew!"
"Creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Perfect for this beer. I can't wait til this comes out in cans. It will be a staple my house. Another amazing VT DIPA."
"Rumor has it they may start selling cans, but if you can't wait until then... head Northeast and enjoy!"
"What I really like about this beer is that the body is just right. Its pretty light focusing mostly on the hops. It's quite easy to drink due to the lightness of the body. You could drink a bunch of these and not feel full or have your mouth all tied up by stickiness."
"Drinkability: Great beer and am very happy to have got to try it. I will be seeking this one out when it hits in cans which now looks like it will be a while. IPA's are my favorite and this is another to add to the list."
"Sort of one dimensional."
"D: Made it a point to go to the Alchemist just for this beer, it was well worth the trip. A very solid, top tier east coast IIPA that was well balanced and the 8% ABV is hardly noticeable."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, and in turn very easy to drink. Not particularly crisp per se, but certainly pleasant. A very good DIPA.... not in my absolute upper echelon (double trouble, PTE, PTY, and Pure Hoppiness) but just a slight step below it. Certainly seek it out if you're in the area."
"Cheers"
"O: A very nice dIPA that deserves to be up with the big boys. I'd imagine super-fresh on tap would take this a notch higher."
"Had on tap at the brewpub in Waterbury. I made the half hour trip to try this well reviewed beer and it mostly lived up to the hype. Nose was almost overwhelmingly floral, taste was well balanced between the hop and malt flavors compared to most IIPAs that I've sampled. Am looking forward to the cans to come later this year."
"D: For a beer of its abv, it's amazingly sessionable."
"Thanks again Mike!"
"Thanks Sammy for getting this bottle into Ontario! Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Lots of lacing coats the side of my glass. Some hop floaties in the beer, which I think just adds to this. I can smell the hops before I even lift the glass off the table. Lots of resiny pine and citrus hops in the aroma. Very nice bitterness, but there seems to be a malt balance as well. This is certainly one of my favourites."
"An exceptional IPA from John Kimmich in Waterbury. The heady is about perfect from start to finish. It's slightly cloudy just after pour. You can smell the floral aroma from about 1 foot away. Some IPA's can overpower with hops but this one is all about balance and subtly. They will be releasing the heady in cans late April. I hope they keep the same magic from the tap to the can."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. This is a great IIPA."
"Very impressive DIPA. The hop aromas, very C-hop, are very satisfying and very fresh as if I am at the brewery now , as if hand bottled. Great lacing and head. Unfiltered look and taste, a full mouthfull. A little astringent. Grea carbonation. Bottle from Fred."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle in trade with Glouglouburp. Thanks! Pours a hazy amber color with a big white head and nice lacing. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit hops. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Excellent citrus hop flavor with a nice malt balance and a nice bitter hop finish. Very similar to some west coast DIPAs I have had the pleasure to try. A very good beer."
"drinkability is great. the bitterness never overpowers the solid malt footing. the alcohol is almost unnoticed until a little warmth starts to grow in my stomach around mid-glass. nice hoppy depth. i enjoy the balance of this one - certainly not a palate shredder, and not as in-your-face as some, but it's got much more repeatability as a result. good stuff!"
"Very drying, invitingly sippable, this is a very good beer, but not sure what all the hoopla is about. Not to say I'd ever turn one down!"
"I could have drank a couple bombers of this. I shouldn't have shared it. Lol. But it was shared with another beer lover that deserved to try it. I am for sure in debt to Sideswipe and will have to give him something amazing. Thanks again man"
"D: Very good. I finished my half of the bottle more quickly than I meant to, and I was disappointed that there wasn't any more. A very fine beer, and it's a shame that I probably won't get my hands on another anytime soon."
"This is one of my favorite beers from New England that I wish I could get more often. But then, I'd be too spoiled."
"Drinkability- a bit of bitterness and the overly pine nose turns me off to this one a bit"
"My all time favorite beer... so far."
" Thanks Adam, really it brought a little sunshine to a cold winter's eve - the wonderful big IPA is a treat. You have to monitor yourself because the hops are so juicy you might forget you are drinking an alcoholic beverage. It is supremely drinkable and met every expectation, I just dind't have any idea how good it could be. I consider this possibly one of the best of the style, it is very near a perfect Imperial Ipa to me. Mr Korsak, thanks again for sharing this Heady topper with me."
"Highly recommend! If you didn't know better it would definitely comes across as a top notch """west coast""" DIPA - Excellent work by a top notch brewer/brewery!"
"The CPJ"
"My first try of this one and sad to say it was a bottle, would love to try the draft and can't wait for the cans. Looks like the West Coast has found a little bit of competition."
"This beer definitely lived up to the hype for me, I look forward to trying it again in the future."
"(D) One on the best beers I have had. I would like to try Pliny the Younger on draft and one day compare."
"D - not quite session, but scary drinkable for 8%"
"Overall, one of the better East Coast IPAs I have had."
"D: The ale, admittedly, feels bigger than 8%. The hoppiness, strong as it is, benefits from the balance of the malt. An excellent IPA, even if it isn't quite the west coast hop bomb."
"With a smooth medium body and drinkable crispness, The Alchemist Brewpub's Heady Topper is certainly a top IPA. Cheers to 2010!"
"Well done, Alchemist."
"Bottle. Pours a light amber straw yellow color with a slight white head. Some sediment floating around. Danky type aroma of citrus and some pine type notes, some onion as well. Some lace. Medium mouthfeel. Slighlty sweet taste with a strong hop bitter flavor. Lingering bitterness. Does it live up to the hype? Hmm, it's decent but nothing that I think warrants the hype that it gets."
"Flavor is similarly fruity, with a big grapefruit presence, moderately bitter, lush and packed with resinous hop flavor and a slight undercurrent of pale malt sweetness. Sticky and dank. Body is fairly light, and with no trace of the abv, it's almost too easy to drink. """Carbonated to pub draft levels""" as the label states. A bomber or two of this hop nectar would be awesome, on tap even better. Thanks again Alex!"
"I really appreciated having the chance to sample this bottle but it only had room to disappoint considering the hype surrounding it. While a solid and good DIPA, it's no Piny killer."
"Overall, this is a really solid DIPA. It is pretty drinkable. A lot of great flavors and very fresh. I had no problems with my glass of this. Good stuff. Thanks Steve!"
"Feels smooth and creamy and is very nice to sip and appreciate the dominant pine notes."
"Very piney earthy aromas thick drying in the middle with only a bit of that citrus on the finish. Oily and resiny with caramel and cereal quailities. Toffee is there as well a bit of sweetness with a forever finish. Great ipa and not one that falls into the everyday category"
"An awesome treat to land this bottle and if it's ever bottled again I will do everything I can get snag another!"
"Bottle into my Narke tulip...Medium copper, not bright or sparkly enough for me. Tope head pretty good, looks good, nice retention and lacing...Aroma is really malty, lots of caramel, great to balance out the hops and alcohol. Hop presence is huge though, really good...The taste is also really malty, very different and unique for a dipa, but great to mask the hops and make it drinkable. Hops are more there in the feel."
"D: Insanely drinkable, wish I could live at the pub and get this on draft!! Great stuff."
"D - One of the top DIPAs I've ever had. It really lived up to the hype and was a pleasure to drink."
"D-Not the hoppiest, the biggest, the most bitter or the most spectacular IPA but in the end the hop and malt bill work wonders on the palate and makes for one mighty fine drinking brew. Thank you John Kimmich for producing such an impressive beer."
"One of the best DIPAs I've had in recent memory and possibly the best east coast DIPA I've ever tasted. Super drinkable but with tons of hop character and bitterness. Really superb beer."
"D - Okay, so this beer has been hyped up and down for a long while. East vs. West, this one stands up to the best DIPA's out there. So easy to drink is ridiculous. World-class, as far as I'm concerned."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Decent appearance, nose is not complex for full. Flavor, the same... not complex, but if you like hops, this is it. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Light body, very dry in the mouth, I can't praise it enough. I love this beer, so glad I have another."
"So this is a delectable brew and should be sought out if you are into IPAs at all."
"D: Believe the hype! Even though I still prefer the foamy and bubbly nature of """Sculpin", this one was a worthy competitor. Very distinctive in a very competitive category."
"Thanks again mmtroop1218."
"Overall I can't think of a better DIPA that's made on the East coast and it rivals the big boys made out West. A very nice beer that's well worth a shot."
"My favorite beer hands down. My buddy and I compare every double ipa we have to this one ( and regular ipas to their holy cow) and we've found nothing that surpasses either of them. Hopefully their bottle run was a sneak preview. If they truly start canning, everyone outside of new england is in for a treat."
"Although pleasant was like drinking hop water. It was good but not worth trading the farm away. PtY is a lot better."
"Nice beer overall. Awesome for an east coast style DIPA."
"I found his brew to be eerily reminiscent of, dare I say it?, Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which I dearly love. For me, this beer totally lived up to the hype. Glad I had he opportunity and hope I'll be able to enjoy this again. Very highly recommended!"
"I have had almost every major IIPA in the world, this is easily in the top tier, and deserves all the hype. By far the best IIPA not made on the west coast, and blows 99% of those away. Awesome awesome beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable at a respectable 8%. I enjoyed this one but it doesn't hold up to the better batches of COAST boy king."
"Really exquisite and delicious. Quite a treat and a DIPA that I would love to have the opportunity to drink more often. An instantaneous favorite in the style. Just awesome."
"D- Fantastic DIPA overall-complex and certainly in my top five-its a bit to bitter to take the #1 spot for me. Its certainly a hop bomb. Reminds me of my experience with PtY-although that was almsot 2 yrs ago. I hope the Alchemist keeps releasing this because it is a must try DIPA!"
"Drinkability is exceptional. This beer goes down so easy. Packed with a good helping of hops and lots of citrus. The nose is very aromatic. An enjoyable drink all around and the ABV is unnoticeable. I might be in the minority, but I think I actually enjoy this more out of the bottle than on tap, even though a fresh pint is still excellent. I'm really hoping this comes to cans soon, because this really is one of the best DIPA's out there."
"Very impressed at how this held up post-release. Wish I could have a case of it to go through over the winter holiday."
"Comments: This beer lived up to expectations when I had it off the tap on release day and it continues live up to the hype two weeks later. I'm willing to bet the 12/31 drink by date is simply a suggestion... tempted I am to drink this beer even later just to see how it holds up. Can this Heady be Topped?"
"Epic"
"Such an amazing beer. It has temporarily hurt other beers for me, as all I want is another Heady Topper. Currently my favorite beer. Another trip to The Alchemist is in order."
"Overall this ties with Pliny the Elder for my favorite Double IPA objectively, but the heavy use of Citra hops gives this an edge in my book."
"In terms of drinkability it doesn't get any better than this. So smooth and flavorful, and with so much juicy hop flavor I didn't want to put the glass down. I need to make it to this brewery and just sit at the bar drinking this for an entire evening. Awesome stuff."
"Drinkability- Oh man. What a great freaking beer. I honestly can't think of another IPA that's like it. It doesn't have the sort of bitterness of the Pliny's, the sweetness of a Hopslam or the maltiness of a Furious. It's sort of an enigma among IPA's and I freaking love the shit out of it. Really glad this brewery put out a few bottles. Hopefully they put out more in the future; this beer needs to be shared!"
"D - This beer is beyond drinkable. I'm looking forward to getting to my other bottles because this is going to make for a great Christmas. Thanks John, for finally caving to the pressure and making this available to all (or at least some). Now about that canning line..."
"Malt is more noticeable on the palate, lending a bread-like backbone that's quickly washed away by an assault of hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, pineapple and papaya flavors try their hardest to balance a huge resinous hop bitterness. This is dry and light, decidedly West Coast style, with a lower to moderate level of carbonation. The bitterness grows astringent after a while, and while I do appreciate high IBUs, I feel that in this case it's out of balance with the hop flavor. It's an excellent DIPA nonetheless, and one of the best hoppy beers I've had from the East Coast."
"Drinkability - Damn quaffable. Honestly, a freaking great DIPA. I see some lower reviews and I honestly can't understand why? Having this side by side a fresh PtE, this is so close to it. If this was readily available like PtE, I would buy this alongside it. A very enjoyable beer, and well worth the trade for it. It has its differences from PtE, but that is why I would freaking love to have both of these in my refrigerator at the same time. So similar yet so different. My first experience from The Alchemist and a hugely positive one at that. As stated, very glad I was able to try this. Again, this is not just hype in my opinion, this really is a top notch, top 5 DIPA in my book."
"I'm convinced, given the freshness of this one (~10 days old) that I'm getting something pretty close to the full experience. I don't agree that this is better than Pliny the Younger (this is much more balanced than the latter, so it's a poor comparison to start with). But I agree it's in the same conversation as Pliny the Elder."
"Edit: Drank over a case of this over the summer. Simply phenomenal beer. I'm not sure how or where this beer could improve. One of the best beers I have had. Dangerously drinkable and mouth wateringly delicious. My highest recommendation."
"22oz bottle poured into a perfect pint glass. Pours a murky golden burnt orange color. Smell is intensly piney with lots of pineapple, citrus and appricot. Taste is very similar to smell. Piney resin, fruit taste and a nice light malt backbone. Nicely carbonated giving a thick and lasting mouthfeel. Amazing beer. One of the best and most drinkable double IPAs. I cannot reccomend this one enough."
"Overall very drinkable, if you enjoy super bitter beers. No malt balance to speak of, but great hop character. A clear variation of the West Coast hop bomb, a la' Pliny the Elder."
"I only wish I could have made the trek back to the brewery the day of the release, but it won't be long until I am back to enjoy this and all of the other great beers that are flowing on any given day."
"Very happy I finally get to try this one, straight from the tap into my pilsner glass. Pours yellowish orange with a slight haze, small off white head with good retention and some nice lacing. As soon as this beer hits the table I can smell the hops. This is up there with some of the best smelling IPAs made. Pineapple, sweet malts, tropical fruit, not a hint of bitterness - just wonderful aroma hops. Taste is surprisingly different from the smell, and this isnt a bad thing. Pineapple and tropical fruit flavor but with a bit more bitterness then I was expecting, some biscuit malt (not a lot, just enough to provide balance), a slightly spicy, earthy hop finish. The lighter side of medium body with a medium light carbonation, finishes very clean. This is an excellent IPA and hands down the best one to come from anywhere east of California. Very different then the west coasters in terms of flavor, but much smoother and more drinkable then Pliny or some of the other notables. I wanted to try everything at the Alchemist and this was my first, and then my second beer. Wish I could drink this every night."
"Beer is light in body and quite carbonated in the mouth. Interesting, probably due to the carbonation, the first thing I notice in this beer is the hop profile. A floral and fruity explosion of hop flavors, again tropical fruits and some citrus that gives way in the late palate to some moderate bitterness. I think they could have gotten away with more bitterness but overall it is a truly amazing IPA. Hard to top."
"Drinkability: The best east coast DIPA I've ever had? Maybe (it's up there w/ HopSlam, which is marginally east coast, I suppose). But it's lacking in some of that bold dynamism that makes beers like PtE (and to a lesser extent PtY), Hop 15, Pure Hoppiness, and White Knuckle so fantastic. At 8.0%, it's not nearly as bold in the ethanol department as some of those, though (which is to its credit), but I would gladly accept this one at 9%, 10%, or even 11% if it could just amp up the sweetness and the bitterness a little. I know the back of the bottle says that this beer isn't aiming to be the biggest, or the strongest, or the most bitter, but the flavor combination is great enough that, with a little extra thrust, this one could be the world's best DIPA. On the whole, though, I was really impressed with this one and thrilled to try it - Heady Topper is the best non-Bell's DIPA (HopSlam, Oracle, and Big Head all top it) that I've had brewed outside California ... and that's sayin' something."
"D: Pretty easy to drink but a bit one dimensional with only hop flavor and not much bitterness or dryness."
"SkÅL!"
"This is a great DIPA, fellow Cali BA's, believe it. I'll probably never have it again unless they finally decide to can it or I make a trip to VT, which is sad. I'd put this beer up against the top DIPA's we've got out here. Great job Alchemist!"
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth with medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: The best DIPA I've ever had. I cannot recommend this beer enough."
"Poured golden orange with yellow highlights that had a half finger of head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was quite piney, grassy, earthy, and hoppy with a good malt prsence but had lots of fruitness as well. I was able to detect a little citrus. Candied sugar. and wood character. The taste was really grassy piney with woody, caramel, and citrus zest accents but did have good sweetness from the malts to balance out the bitterness. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slighty fruity, woody, earthy, hoppy, bitter, and crisp dry finish. It drank above average and was glad to have been able to try this beer. Hopefully this stuff makes it to the west coast some day. Have to say it was a solid IPA from the east coast."
"D: Well, I wish I could get more of this. Unfortunately that's probably not going to happen. I could easily have polished off two bombers of this on my own. This 5.0 is in the hopes that they can it sometime in the future."
"D - For me, Heady Topper is a whale of all whales. I wish I could drink it all the time. I could easily drink more than the 11 oz. that I had in this serving, unfortunately, I'll probably never have it again unless The Alchemist decides to make it more available."
"D - This is a great IPA...I am definitely not let down at all by this one. Reminds me a bit of Pliny and Gubna...both of which I really enjoy. It is right up there in the upper echelon of IPA's...hope they bottle this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, lightly acidic hoppiness. Deceptively drinkable, doesn't blow the palate away but a great mix of complex hoppiness with just enough malt to balance it. Really nice stuff, thanks grub!"
"Edit: I've had HT a few times out of cans since my initial review and enjoyed it significantly more. I don't know why that first bottle didn't seem very good. I'm changing my scores for the beer but leaving up the old review."
"D: Certainly a very, very good IPA. Actually reminded me a lot of Sculpin, but more bitter. Would definitely like to have this one again."
"Well done Alchemist. Well done."
"Drinkability is dangerous. Flavor and smell is so amazing, you just want to keep drinking it. Alcohol is not even noticed, and the 22 oz bottle was gone before I knew what happened. Wish I could have had a lot more of this one."
"D - very nice, but perhaps lacking a bit of malt balance making this a bit more difficult to enjoy. still, having this EVERY night would never cause me a problem"
"D- Very high. This is a damn tasty beer and is -no question- up there with the big boys from the west coast. Of course, drinking it a week after bottling has got to be a factor... and I'm glad I did just that! Does it kill Pliny? No. Is it better than Younger? No, not in my book, but hey, that's damn hard to do. Does it exceed my lofty expectations? It's up there, man. Good stuff."
"WOW....6 months ago when I was staring at the old BA Top 100 and trying to tick the whole thing I remember seeing a few monsters on the list that were going to be damn near impossible to get. Heady Topper was one of those monsters. Never did I think that before the end of 2010 I would be staring at a glass of it in the comfort of my own home. Thank you Jim for making this happen (and thanks to The Alchemist for bottling it!)"
"I've been waiting a long, long time to finally try this one. Unlike an unfortunately-large percentage of other beers with so much hype, I have enjoyed this immensely. Huge, huge thanks again to Ryan and Nick for the chance to finally try this. Cheers to both of you."
"Overall this is a pretty fantastic DIPA right up there with some of the other fine examples of the style, but it definitely has a uniqueness to it with the low carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, incredible smell, hops-galore and easy drinkability. Definitely glad I was able to try it and hoping that this beer does get canned and into regular circulation some day. More people need to experience this one."
"I know this review is not poetry but it's the best I can do for now. This beer was worth the frozen fingers and toes"
"This really grew on me the more I drank it, the resiny hop flavor intensified with each sip and really took the perceived bitterness up a bit. At first I didn't think it was 'too' bitter, but each pour tops off the glass and revitalizes the intensity. Just huge hop flavor all throughout, excellently vibrant with juicy hop flavors and no malt presence to speak of. Medium bodied and relatively low carbonation, I had to really control myself to keep from downing the bottle. I can't say that I didn't expect it to be this good, but it was certainly a nice surprise. A really nice brew. If they can this in greater quantities, it'll be gold, Jerry, gold!"
"D: This beer shines with hops, and is easy to drink. I am having a heck of a time typing this review up because I keep taking another drink!"
"The beer is well carbonated, medium bodied and it incorporates the alcohol into the hoppy flavors well. It's just as good out of the bottle as it was on tap, and this is one of the few beers that exceeded my expectations once I got to try it. I will absolutely make the trip back to Waterbury to drink this again, and I will anxiously await the canned release."
"I've reviewed the tap and cask version of this beer. I wanted to try a fresh bottle so I cracked one open tonight on taco night and split it with the wife 12-6-10. There is nothing like an ipa fresh on tap. This beer still amazing. Didn't loose anything on taste, smell, or appearance. Not quite as crisp as on tap which effects only the mouthfeel and drinkability ever so slightly. What an exceptional beer."
"Considering the abv & amount of hops this is a very drinkable beer. I'm glad to see that John was kind enought to bottle a few of these so that BA's from beyond have a chance to give it a try."
"The drinkability was fantastic. I could have had glass after glass after glass and not tired of the brew. It went down so easily and once its in cans, it may be the only IIPA that I buy (up to this point I haven't bought any in the past few years because I've been disappointed since moving out of san diego... this tops the ones I used to drink back then for sure)."
"D: I never expected this one to blow me away and it doesn't. That being said, it's still a very very good beer and a solid representation of the west coast style IIPA. Bitter and hoppy without being too overwhelming. Very enjoyable and now that they'll can it some time in the future, go out and get some!"
"Get to The Alchemist, try this beer, period."
"D: this is a very easy drinking beer. it goes down easy ."
"Many have compared this beer to the almighty Pliny the Younger. I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison. Heady Topper is for certain one of the greatest beers I have ever had the pleasure to try."
"D: They say 8% abv but honestly, I could 'session' this beer. It is absolutely fantastic. One of if not the best beer I have had. Truly amazing and if you can get it fresh, get it!!"
"Drinkability: So sessionable for a big DIPA."
"d - Overall, I thought this was a great DIPA. I was a little worried it wouldn't live up to the hype, but it pretty much did. Personally I think I might rank HopSlam and PTE a bit higher, but this is a great IPA I would love to have again. I got a lot of pine in the smell and a nice mix of fruit and pine in the smell and taste, and I thought it was really easy to drink at 8% ABV. If I was up in Vermont again, I would definitely go back to the Alchemist for this beer."
"Impression: If I had both fesh PTE and fresh Heady Topper side by side, I'm not sure which I'd reach for first. This is a must try, to say the least."
"Great beer. Would love to have access to it back home."
"Along with the balance, the bitterness and carbonation are absolutely perfect. Drinkability is through the roof, 12 oz for $4 for the best DIPA I have had."
"DB- The best draft I have ever had for four dollars. Beats Pliny out in my mind. A truly great balance of many hop flavors, mouthfeel and citrus. I hope the Alchemist sticks to its ways and makes great beer like this for many years."
"My initial review (from the tap at the restaurant) was all 5s.  Unfortunately, after drinking the canned Heady many times over the past few years, I can say this beer has finally fallen off a bit.  The most recent batch I sampled had a muted profile, with a heavier booziness and milder citrus flavor.  The old wallop of flavor has become more of a jab.  It's still delicious, it just isn't quite the same beer, and certainly isn't """perfect""" any longer.  Perhaps I will get a particularly good batch at some point in the future, but my days of running around trying to find Heady are over, if the quality indeed does vary batch to batch."
"Overall I am just floored. I have been able to try this twice now and each time I am more impressed then before. Simply amazing and I wish more people would get to try this one. It can hold its own with any of the big boys any day of the week."
"D- I don't care about the national hype train this is the best dipa I've had and the includes pliny. The only thing I've had that's better than topper is topper on cask."
"Easily drank one of these, a good portion of another, and seriously had to order one of the 3oz samples before leaving just to get that final taste. If I wasn't driving to Waitsfield on dark route 100 right after I easily would have had two more. Easily. Get this while you can folks, it is indeed that good."
"D: I got a wild child and really loved it. Got this basically because my girlfriend wanted a taste. Thanks! Best DIPA I have had on tap by far. Damn their lack of growler fills. This beer is worth the hype. It I wasn't in the company I was in I would have reduced myself to a beast and lived behind the pub. Outstanding."

"I had heard so much about this beer I finally decided I had to drive south to check it out. Off the tap it was a deep gold color leaning towards amber with some of its hues. The head was two-fingers thick, playground-sand-colored, displayed great retention as a perfectly tight cap and left consistent bands of thin lacing. The aroma was big and spicy, full of aggressive hops and a musty quality almost like armpit odor. I know that sounds awful but I was blown away by how much smell was emitting from this beer. The flavors were equally huge. A deep hop profile of pine, grapefruit and kumquat with some white pepper and similar spiciness was balanced nicely by the malt sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. The finish was again hoppy with edgy notes of bitter resin and some lemon zest. It was almost like a wet-hopped beer with the drinkability of good American Brown Ale because the alcohol was so well hidden. The mouthfeel was very smooth but the carbonation gave the right amount of 'fill' to its medium body. One of the best Vermont beers I have ever had and one of the best Imperial/Double IPAs I've ever come across."
"If you are able to make it to the Alchemist for a Heady Topper, do be warned---the alcohol content is over 10%, according to the brewer I spoke with."
"This is a rarity on the East Coast. A well attenuated IPA with a unique, diverse hop character that you can drink all night long. It's a shame that the Alchemist doesn't do growlers so more people can try this beer."
"This beer poured a beautiful orange-blond color with lots of foam. Not the first cask ale I've had though. The aroma was strong and hoppy with hints of citrus. The taste started out strong and hoppy and faded into a nice citrusy bitterness. Well balanced for a DIPA and as their description says, very drinkable. Packs a wallop at 140IBUs."
"Overall drinkability was very good as the high ABV was well hidden. This was worth the trip!"
"Had more than one of these during our visit to the brewpub. Nice and orangey amber, I dove right in and picked up on an intriguing woody-earthy character in the aroma. There was also a nice new mown hay essence and candied hoppyness as well. That is a lot of excitement to live up to, but luckily, the beer delivered all of this in the taste as well. The earthiness was also pretty present in the finish. This is an excellent double IPA which will keep you ordering more. I can't say any more than that even at 8% abv...I still wanted to keep drinking. No taste fatigue or wobbliness in the legs after one. Nice beer."
"Taste: Wicked bitter, but feels almost milky in the gullet (thank you mister cask!). An all-out hop attack, the malt can't do anything but surrender to this unstoppable force. The hops were so intense that I actually had my fill of it, and spent the rest of my weekend drinking lambics and other low-alpha acid brews. I loved it and will have it again, but not 2-3 pints in one session."
"Drinkability...is this really 7.5%? Fuhget aboudit! This won't even feel like a 5%, it's so well hidden. I really wish I had gotten this on cask at the pub. Maybe next time."
"Needless to say, this is a must try for hopheads out there. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and give it a whirl. One of the only downfalls of this ale is that it drinks like a meal, so be careful with what you pair it with."
"Was able to go over to the Alchemist yesterday while up in VT doing some snowshoeing. Was able to stop in and try the Heady Hopper, which I have heard great things about. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The pint was poured to medium golden yellow color, was somewhat cloudy and had a nice sized white head that leaves very nice, thick lacing down the entire glass. The aroma was incredible, hops all the way! When it was served all I could smell was cascade hop aroma and I was three feet away from the glass! The flavors of this brew explode in the mouth from the hops, citrus grapefruit and oranges just dominate, while you are still able to pick up the malt but it was hard and it also disappeared quite quickly! I am not sure if I have had anything else that states that it has 120 IBUs but the hop bite was not unbearable, I am not sure if there is a level where IBUs dont really matter anymore but all I can say is that this brew was excellent, lived up to the hype and expectation. I honestly can say it may be one of my favorite brews of all time and by far was the best one experienced on this trip through Vermont."
"In my opinion, this might be the most drinkable double IPA I have ever had! Color is a nice golden hue, and then the aroma... oh, the aroma. Heady Topper STINKS of cascade, I love it! Goes down really smooth, hoppy, but not too hoppy, totally balanced. I look forward to trying more beers by the Alchemist."
"Presentation is a 12oz pilsner shaped glass, with a little foamy head over the dark straw colored brew. Laced excellently. Aroma lets no one forget this isn't called an imperial IPA for nothing, it's shouting """hops""" to the hills. Taste was pleasantly of pale malts, and then the hops came through the swinging doors and took everyone out. Crisp, heavy, hops bitterness, and I swear I could see a hops oil slick on the surface, but maybe that was just me. Mouthfeel and drinkability are as expected of the style, if it's your thing, you're good to go, and if not, you're one-and-done. Meets the style to a T. A must have from The Alchemist."
"On tap at the Alchemist brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Damn, 8% ABV and 120 IBU's, but totally smooth and tasty. Amber color with a low white bubbly head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Smooth and even mouthfeel leads to an intense flavor of pineapple and orange peel hops with a hint of peaches. The ABV is subtle and not overpowering at all. A fine web of lacing dances around the inside of the glass. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire glass. This one is real tasty and I ripped through it because I couldn't stand the thought of it not rolling over my taste buds for more than a few seconds."
"Served a pale amber with a small light head. Hops are the flavor of choice here, but they are done right. Such a yummy bite. Actually does live up to it's name as the hops are strong enough to give off the heady within the buzz. Hops are not overly complex, yet not too simple either. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Served only in 12oz glasses, the abv is not at all apparent. Sooo smooth. I'm sad that El Jefe is no longer on the menu, but I'd take the Heady Topper over the chief anyday."
