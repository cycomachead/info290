review_text
"Deep amber in color with a murky appearance.  There's a good inch of densely packed beige head resting on top.  Heavy lacing is on my glass.  Aroma of citrus hops and cereal grains is prominent.  The flavor is a deep citrus burn comparable to an orange that is held in check by some light cereal grains.  On the fade you get a nice citrus hop burn.  The mouth is fairly thick,creamy, and a bit chalky."

"O - A tasty DIPA. I imagine this will dissapoint some of hop heads due to lack of hop-ness in the taste, but I would recommend it."
""
"Pretty good IPA, not to hoppy with a citrus after taste"
""
""
"Overall: A balanced DIPA with a huge malt backbone. If you want a DIPA with more balance than in-your-face hoppiness, this sipper is for you."

"One of my favorite DIPA's Way too drinkable"
"looks great, nice amber color. good couple inches of head, good lacing. not a strong smell, sweet citrusy aroma. tastes the way it smells, very pleasant. feels good, very good after taste. makes you want to drink more. very good!"

"O: Not a super fresh bottle but well with in it's best by date, and I gotta say, it's aged quite well. I've had it before where it starts with a big grapefruit punch in the face, but the time seems to have mellowed it quite nicely making the other flavors come out. Love this one!"
"Smooth high ABV IPA with good use of flavoring hops which is what I like in my IPAs."
""
"-- Firm hoppiness with flashes of brightness, but I wonder if it’s lost a step: how quickly do Missouri IPAs move off the shelf of a Paramus wine shop? Smooth and balanced overall, but by reputation I was hoping for more from this one. 4"
"Yum. Excellent finish that isn't too bitter. Mugs up!"
""
"O: Just wasted $10 on a 4 pack. Wouldn't recommend unless you like your IPAs bite-less."
""
""
"cloudy orang with off quickly disspating white head, leaves moderate lacing on glass.  Smell of pine and nutty malt.  Tastes nutty with pine and slight citrus, well balanced with excellent bitters but pronounce malt.  Good carbonation and IPA nip."
""
""
""
"Sure, this was strong but being that this was a beer to savor, that wasn't a deterrent at all. IPA's like this enhance the style overall since they show that they don't all have to be hop-bombs that burn the taste buds from the get-go. This was fabulous stuff that warmed me up nicely on a cold winter's night and next time I head to the store, I'm getting a full four-pack of this. Great stuff that deserves a higher rating on here!"

"Pours a Lovely cloudy light amber.  Nice creamy head.  Smells earthy, damp and musky.  Nice bitterness up front.  Good malt flavor, slightly sweet, finishes with a lovely hop bouquet more floral and less piney than most.  An excellent IPA.  Right up there with Enjoy by and Pliny in my estimation."
"Improves as it warms........not one I would revisit"
""
"Great tasting IPA very consistent it's always great"
""
""
""
""
""
"Really malty initial taste, kind of like the beer camp ipa from Sierra Nevada but this dipa does go down smooth. I like the amount of carbonation. But still not worth it"
"Mouthfeel could be crisper. Won't be back. Wasn't expecting world class but I'm pretty irritated I spent hard earned cash on this. A 750 of saison Brett would have been a much wiser choice."
""
""
""
"I liked this ipa.. Has a nice hoppy taste, but there is a malt backbone to this beer. Alcohol is pretty well hidden is this brew.. Worth a try if you can find it. Well made beer"
"Overly sweet and boozy for my liking. Really tastes more like a Barleywine than IPA."

"Poured into a Boulevard Tulip glass- kicked up a beautiful huge fluffy tan head that lasted a long time, left wonderful lacing to the end. The color was a nice dark orange-Amber that was a bit hazy. The aroma was big and fruity, with some nice citrus notes, and a bit of sweet malty aromas. The taste was very nice, with citrus and floral hop flavors and a nice sweet malty backbone. The mouthfeel was medium to thick, with a nice carbonation bite. Overall, quite a tasty brew- will be buying this one again the future"

"O: Overall, while this beer is sweet upfront and bitter in the finish it is pretty well balanced. This is a big DIPA and definitely more of a sipping beer. Enjoyable but certainly not one of the best that I have had in the style - I favor less piney hops in my IPAs/DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(3.95) O: Overall the malting here is special and deep, very complimentary to the  equally impressive hop levels. Previous had their pop-up (session), and single-wide (ipa), each getting more  aggressively hopped. This certainly doesn't disappoint, 6 pack worthy and the 8.5% abv is spot on perfect, not intrusive, while still being highly drinkable. The only knock is that it could be considered a bit sweet at times. Very good."

"Prying off the cap releases a floral nose with a little grass over light fruit and a hint of grain. Pours hazy gold with a 2” finely bubbled off-white foam cap. An exceptionally creamy palate with big citrus, traces of melon or perhaps guava, very light caramel and light grain notes finishes with a citrusy hop accent that segues into a quinine type bitter over lingering citrus flavors. A very creamy medium body with fine soft carbonation."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours hazy amber with creamy, off-white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade, caramel and ripe fruit.  Body is full, creamy and tangy.  Caramel malt, citrusy hops, ripe fruit nicely balanced on the palate.  Finish is long and bitter.  Excellent  brew."
".Overall- ok.  Smooth for a pn IPA is best attribute."

"fairly decent....earthy hoppy....has some toffee notes like a red ale......a bit of grapefruit. .....I am not too keen on the toffee red ale note and after having more of this the flavors clash a little. its still pretty good but my least fav from BVD!!!"

"12oz bottle.A hazy medium orange amber with an offwhite lasting head,light lacing on the pour. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, mild plum notes,yeast with some citrus floral hops. Taste same as aroma, a sweet mild alcohol flavor with God bitterness. Palate is a full bodied smooth mouthfeel, goes down easy and good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity with a good citrus floral hops bitterness for balance. Overall a very good full flavored and nicely balanced brew."

"The hops are blended into the background and not shining through all that much. The fairly dirty finish also disagrees with me. After having a Tank 7 this was a bit of a let down."

"A very good DIPA from Boulevard, it reminds me in it's great balance of DFH 90 Minute IPA, which is one of my all-time favorites.  A strong malt backbone meets a solid herbal pine hops presence, with light citrus lingering in the backgrounds.  Very drinkable even with the higher ABV."

"Double Wide pours a bronze color with a big, huge, fluffy lacing head.  Nice big floral aroma, with warm hints of alcohol.  The taste is more balanced, but strong, strong malt backbone, with a nice noticeable floral flavor, nice hints of alcohol.  Good body and good feel.  Overall its a good beer, very balanced yet strong."

"Just not feeling this one, I've had syrupy and big DIPAs before (Chillwave, Hopslam, Hi-Res, etc.) but this one is just lacking in balance on multiple fronts. Also way too much vinous fruit and berry esters which I loathe except in Belgians."

"Overall, this is a very well-done IPA that stands out from the rest of the pack in that it isn't boozy or bordering on astringent with it's use of hops like some DIPAs can be. That said, it also lacks some of that pungent juicy hop kick. It's a fine line to walk, and this one does it a bit more conservatively than most. However, that makes for an very drinkable brew that pairs well with a lot of different types of food."

"Great head tht slowly dissapates. Nice malty flavor with a great amount of hop bitterness. Aslight citrusy-piney aftertaste which just adds to the great taste of this beer. You can get a bit of alcohol taste but not enough to ruin the flavor. This hopped up beer is surprisingly balanced and the malt, hop and citrus flavors balance perfectly. Got get yourself one !!"

"It's good to know that Double Wide holds up fairly well, even if somewhat old. I want to try a fresher version, though."
""
""
""

"Overall- This one just doesn't do it for me in large part due to the minty flavors. Some other solid flavors redeem this beer, but its not something I'd repurchase. (75/100)"

"Dark brown appearance and neutral smell, not telling me much about it. Good head that laces and lasts well. Tastes malty and very much Belgium style with a little bit of yeast at the beginning. Much prefer the other boulevard beers."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty deep bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops, pine, a touch of citrus. Taste is bold, bitter up front. Hops, pine, a bit of citrus, caramel malts coming through at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a deep cloudy amber with an orange tint. Very active and creates a huge creamy white head when poured. The aroma is incredible, with definite citrus notes and some slight fruity/floral notes. The taste, thought, while not awful, doesn't live up to the aroma. There's not nearly as much hops in the taste as in the nose. It's just a little nondescript hops and mostly caramel malt. Not sure how that happened. The mouthfeel is silky with a nice bitter bite on the finish. This should be a great IPA but with the flavor so """meh""" when compared to all its other components, it just falls short."
""
""
"O: tasty as hell. Great IPA."
""
""
"Overall – This was a very enjoyable double IPA I must say. It had a nice balance between sweet fruitiness, hop, and breadiness/doughiness all while maintaining a rather smooth easy drinking style. Quite delicious."

"The pours a caramel, honey color with 3 finger carbonation. Foam fades slowly but does not keep residual carbonation at the same level through the drink. Malt on the nose with very lite hoppy-ness, does not have the floral hoppy aroma that you would want or expect with an Imperial IPA. I have had the single wide and honestly prefer that to the double wide. Mouthfeel was flat and the finish leaves you with a poor aftertaste. Taste makes the aroma, with more malt than hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It tastes like an old IPA, but the best by date is a month and a half out. Unless that date is six months from bottling it should be good. I am not impressed with this offering. It tastes more like a red ale."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours red amber with white head. Smells of citrus hops nice welcome. Tastes of citrus with very nice sweet malt, but still enough hop bite that it dominates. Beer is medium bodied slightly heavily carbonated. Overall a very good beer."

"I have to say up front that I am not an IPA fan, only reason I tried this one is because it was part of a set that included the Smokestack Series glass. That being said, this is one of the better examples of the style I have tried. It has a lot of hops, but not to the point of killing off the other flavors. I found it to be fairly balanced, and a decent blend of the sweetness with the bitterness. Better than anticipated, but still not enough to make me a fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm a little bit disappointed, although it's still a solid brew. Boulevard have done some genuinely good beers, and I was expecting good things from this DIPA. But it's a little like a baseline: yeah, it's a Double IPA. But it's nothing more."
""
""
""

"Overall - A nice balanced, and smooth easy drinker. Nothing is over the top, has a little bit of everything with a hop kick. Its a bit weak for a dipa though. This is a fine ipa but its certainly not a hop monster. Nice beer, glad I got to try it."
""
"I've been wanting to try this stuff, for a long time. Pours a deep clouded rusty amber hue with a billowing cloudy pillow of foam, rises well above the rims of the glass. Aroma I could sit and smell this beer all day, super citrus, apricots, spicy Belgian yeast has those Belgian Pale Ale notes a bit of funk tartness that works well with the hop additions. Pine takes a back seat to the more acidic citric notes, muted with Belgian yeast strains in the most beautiful way. A hint of band aid or medicinal quality is quickly brushed under the rug by tart apples, citric notes, and an explicit earthy quality that some call horse blanket or simply """funk""" with an edge of apricot pit ground up on the palate. Citric notes, horse blanket earthy qualities again on the palate, bitter funky yeast notes in a nice double IPA. I'm happy overall, the carbonation and mouthfeel take this beer to another level with the Belgian inspiration the beer has, much with the rest of the Smokestack Series I have sampled thus far. This beer would pair great with a nice meal, pretty much anything I would go with braised pork ribs, or some ribeye with this beer in particular it's a beer that touches on the umami sensors on the palate already so any meats/cheeses would work well here."
""
"O: Like all of the other Boulevard Smokestacks, this is a keeper. For a Double IPA, this is probably the smoothest of a tough style. You could serve this to a new craft beer drinker, and not shock them...but be careful, they might take another one from your stash!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a hazy amber with a big foamy head. Medium lacing. Piney hops and citrus predominate the smell. Those follow through to taste with lingering bitterness. Very floral. Medium mouth with a fair bit of oil. This is a very nice DIPA."
""
""
""
"If so, this was a great fix!"
""
""
""

"Not a bad beer but not terribly refined either. Too much syrupy malt and hops are not quite dynamic enough."

"O - A very unique IPA. Nice to see, as I feel the market is so over satuated with IPA's that are too similar. A very spicy IPA, with sweetness up front and bitterness in the back, it accomplishes it's goals. I'm more of a fruity IPA guy, but this beer is a good one, and I applaud Bouvelard for brewing a very unique DIPA."

"The Double Wide is Double Good...it has been a long time since I first tried the DW...and I think it has definitely improved over the years. The beer pours a hazy copper with foamy white head that is leaving a lace. The scent carries malt with hints of orange peel and other spicy citrus tones. The taste carries a sweet malt with bitter hops that bring hints of citrus and spice. The mouthfeel is full body with good carbonation. Overall this beer is much impreoved and I enjoyed it."

"Overall, not a brew I'd buy again even though I've enjoyed other beers from Boulevard"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the second time I've tried this one, but I forgot to review it the first. It's an averge DIPA. I have no buyer's remorse, but probably won't go with it again. There are many others to explore over this decent, but not outstanding beer."

"Overall: A very good imperial IPA. Has the big hop presence you expect from the style along with a solid sweet malt presence."
"O-a solid DIPA. Not the best I've had and I'm not sure it's worth the almost $3 for a 12 oz bottle, but I enjoyed this beer!"
"O - Much better cold which isn't not a positive statement. Does not resemble an IPA in my humble opinion. Would not recommend."
""
""
"O: This is a wonderfully complex brew that somehow manages to remain quite drinkable at a higher A.B.V. Definitely a less aggressive double I.P.A that most on the market (read: not as hop-forward or boozy), but quite fresh and balanced. I wouldn't hesitate to grab another."

"Overall its nice great malt backbone but huge amount of hops also but not hop forward as some I2PA's. Only 8.5% but swear it tastes higher but not due to alcohol burn as alcohol is well hidden."

"Licorice! Wow. Creamy head with nice bite on the start. Stands up nicely to a cheddar with caramelized onion. Hoppy throughout, with a chewy finish - Would be great with a burger, and other powerful flavors. Surprising in the body - a great choice for a cold day."
"Dark color. A really flat smell to my nose - no fruit and flowers. Lots of fizz in the mouth with very little fruit. Flat, dark flavor. Bitter but not with much fruit. Better with food than straight. Overall, I find this beer disappointing when compared to alternative IPAs. Clearly, my opinion isn't in line with the majority of reviewers. I like other Boulevard brews -- like Tank 7 for example. Oh well, beauty is in the eye and mouth of the sampler..."

"Overall: this was a good beer. Boulevard makes great beer. But this is not among their best. When I see an IPA I the 8% abv range, I think more hoppy and less malt. So the malt coming forward disappoints me a bit. In the end, I would drink this again, but when I compare to other favorite IPA's, like Bell's Two hearted or Ballast Point Sculpin, I don't really think I would choose this first."

"Overall I like this beer a lot, it was very tasty and easy to drink. Was it an elite DIPA, no…but it was a very above average DIPA and considering the bready/malt balance and influence, this goes down in my book as one of those beers to drink any time it’s available as it was full of flavor, complicated and yet simple in it’s commitment to being a well balanced IPA. The hops dominated, but this didn’t shred your taste-buds or bore you either: it was like the average DIPA was captured and corked for our enjoyment."

"double-wide takes the approach to double IPAs that turns me off from the style. yes, it's big, boozy, and has some dryness to it, but the malt body seems to be the dominant factor. pours a coppery, amber tone with a small head. minimal lacing on my mini imperial pint glass. nose is nutty, malty, and full of brown sugar with more than a hint of peach cobbler, but none of the pine and apricot the label promised. taste is sweet up front, with bitterness coming in at the end. i can tell this beer is up there in abv. if they called this a hoppy barleywine i would feel more satisfied, but it doesn't have the tang, the dankness, or the pine i like in an IPA beer. guess my west coast palate is showing....the malts and the abv do give this beer a respectable body, though."

"Overall, a great DIPA; while not as perfect as id like, I get that this would be almost perfect for others. Yes...have this."

"O: This isn't a big bold in-your-face IIPA. You'll find good clean flavors that culminate in something that you can sit back and enjoy. I really liked that for the alcohol content, it didn't feel too malty, and didn't have any alcohol flavor. That made the drinking experience even better. I'd say that people should try and pick this one up if they like IPA's and want one with a little more ABV without having matched high IBU's."
""
"Poured a auburn brown with two finger head and nice lace patches on a mostly earthy citric hop aroma; not getting too much grapefruit/sweet or dark fruit nor too much in terms of sweet malt. Beer is well carbonated so it's light to medium bodied, sharp, crisp, even a little spicy, dry and crisp finish, mostly earthy citric hops and a more of a hoppy than grapey DIPA. Not too much sweetness, but there is a tad bit sweet and breadlike malt so there is a balance underpinning the mostly citric hops and there are a touch of sweet fruits, mind you. The ABV is subdued and this is a sipper that is one you can drink quick, although a little heavy, and not the most flavorful DIPA I've had but did not kill my taste buds and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

"I'm not normally a fan of this style, but I bought a 4-pack for my wife and tried one. I was very pleasantly surprised. I was expecting an onslaught of piney hops, but instead I got a complex balance of malty goodness, grain, and hops, with a smooth drinkability that belied the 8.5% ABV. The booziness was well-masked, with no bite in the finish whatsoever. A very solid offering from Boulevard, one of which I'll certainly try again."

"Great example of bitterness matched with creamy mouthfeel and a dipa with truly multi-dimensional flavor (i.e. not just citrus, tropical fruit, pine). The hops are toned down by many levels of sweetness -- graham cracker, apricot, caramel. The resiny flavor hangs around to keep you wanting more, but every sip is rewarded with several other flavors. A nice surprise."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a massive one third glass head that dissipates slowly, leaving massive lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus hops, light stone fruit and an unusual apricot fruit leather component that is intriguing. Flavor is dominated by sweet malt with citrus, somewhat dissipated herbal hops, hints of stone fruit. Finishes with a pleasant complex hop bitterness. Medium bodied. The hops are not as intensely forward as I hoped, but the hop flavor is relatively complex and interesting. A bit mellow for those spoiled by west coast hop bombs, but the malt / hop balance is nice and the flavors are complex enough to make a pleasant DIPA experience. Wish that dried apricot flavor was as dominant in the flavor as aroma, it is unusual and pleasant. I will return to this again."

"overall a pretty good beer. not the most bitter guy i've ever tried but is a solid option and a good example of flavorful hops. for those looking to learn how to taste hops, i would lean them towards this one."

"O: decent DIPA, flavor is a bit one dimensional"

"On tap, poured from a pitcher at the WA hangout for KC ex-pats, Stan's BBQ in Issaquah. Beautiful mahogany hue, loamy head that dissipates into a melancholy lace. That's how life is - the fullness of our dreams disappear with age and reality, but there's always a trace of those dreams to at least remind you of your youth."

"Overall a very drinkable, if not sessionable, brew especially for the style. Smooth and not overpowering in any sense."
"O- Sometimes the abv gets in the way of flavors, clearly the case here, for me anyway."

"Overall: Not a ton of complexity but everything that it does have is solid. The 8.5% ABV is pretty smooth."

"A very nicely done DIPA that puts the emphasis on malts and hops while greatly taming the high ABV. The hop bitterness is especially well-done. A must-try beer for hop-heads..."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Best before date 8/2013 (don't remember the day). Poured an orangish-red, the color for the flesh of a ripe plum and filled with yeast sediment. The head was a sandy white, the color of an east-coast beach in the spring and fair to moderate lacing. The smell was fairly sweet like a peach or lavendar with good grassy hops. The taste was a little overly sweet, like sucrose. It was like fruit that was a little north of ripe. The hops had strong bittering, but much more low key for a DIIPA. Very full mouthfeel and fair carbonation. Not my favorite of the Smokestack Series which are usually very strong offerings. Definitely not a bad beer, but not the best of the DIIPAs that I love."

"Overall, a solid and vary drinkable double IPA. I think this could probably be paired really nicely with the right food."

"Quite good as it stands; nothing to be ashamed of."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very well balanced DIPA with plenty of hoppiness and lots of sweet maltiness to back it up. Very easy to drink due to the lack of lingering bitterness. Price point is decent as well, at $10.99 for a 4-pack or $9.99 for a 750"
""
""
"Overall – More east coast than west coast taste wise.. and it sits perfectly between a IPA and a DIPA taste wise. I think I expected more from this beer but it's still decent.. it has a little of everything taste wise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer not only for the class but also on general. Definitely will be a repeat beverage to enjoy."
"O - I usually prefer stouts and belgian style ales over IPAs, but I have to say this one hit all the right notes with me. It may not be """in your face""" enough for the die hard DIPA lover, but if you are looking for an exceptionally well-balanced example of the style, don't pass this one up!"
"O: To me this is an old school IPA that is not overly complex, but hits a nice balance between malt and hop bitterness without the cloying sweetness of most DIPA."
"Overall - tamed down, this is too drinkable for adherance to proper safety guidelines.It will be gone well before it ought. This was from the trading days where BGThang hooked me up on a regular basis. With any luck I'll get back into that scene again. Until then, thanks for this one Ken, she's a beaut."
""
""
""
""
"Quite a delicious beer, never had an IPA with a nose like a dry hopped brew come across so mellow and clean on the tongue! Very good amber malt to pair the hops as they develop-must like the PNW beers but with better consideration on the hops-just enough. Had a friend who doesn't like IPAs make it top three all time for him:)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While IPAs are not my favorite type of beer I am learning to like them and this one makes it easy. For sure some hop action but still nicely balanced."

"A malty and mellon, fruity taste with pine cone, hoppy finish. Very balanced malt / hop taste. Thin finish. The malt fruit hop taste is nice if somewhat one dimensional. I'd have it again but it won't knock your socks off. Think of it as an easy going Double IPA."
""

"I liked this beer. This makes for a pretty good """get""" in the long line of very good DIPA's out there."

""
""
"O - would've probably preferred a single or a bomber. Won't have a problem finishing 750 ml, but as far as tasters go, this is a little heavy. Still, worth a shot."
"This is the 1st time I've had this and I must say it's more bitter than I thought it would be. The hops clearly dominate but it's there's plenty of malt presence without being overly sweet. The finish is long, bitter, and mouth wickingly dry. I love it. I wish I would have tried this before. A must try if you like a balance of hop flavor and bitterness."
""
""
"Carbonation is not overly fizzy and makes this beer very drink able."
""
"Taste: Simply fantastic! Hoppy, bitter, flavorful, great aftertaste. This is what an IPA should taste like. First taste piqued my interest. It grows on you quickly. Highly recommend."
"o - overall, i dig it. not a hop head dream, but nice to have a solid iipa that is a bit more malt forward. really tasty and enjoyable...would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a warm, red-orange-tinted medium brown color with a massive, rocky, sand-colored head. A fresh, fruity citrus hop aroma somewhere between orange and grapefruit dominates, but a touch of malty sweetness is also apparent. The flavor is less bright, and is instead driven more by a woodsy, piney blend of hop characteristics, but there is also a good dose of light caramel malts to balance. The medium body is lightened by a fine, active carbonation that may be even a bit too assertive. Overall, though, the rich, resinous, multi-faceted bitterness lingers comfortingly, making this beer an easy one to savor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An awesome DIPA. I was skeptical because it was being sold in a store with mostly commercial craft brewery selections like Sam Adams and Shipyard. This does not fall into the ranks of the latter. For a DIPA, it touches on a lot of the flavors I like and it does it well. I don't really think it is lacking much in any department."
"O- A tasty DIPA that has a nice hop punch. I enjoyed it from start to finish and it was a great brew, but it I thought it was somewhat lacking in complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And that's actually a good thing. It gives this beer a few subtle characteristics if you search for them that puts it a step above a cookie cutter IPA. Lord knows we've got plenty of those. :-)"
""
""
""
"O: Absolutely awesome double IPA. One of the best imperial IPA’s I’ve ever had. Very impressive."
""
"Poured this Imperial IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a hazy tan color, produced a thick off white head, excellent retention and great lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of a very strong citric, piney hop aroma. Medium in body, a foundation of malted grain, fresh baked bread that is overtaken by a bitter citric, piney oily hop flavor. There are some slight suggestions of spicy white pepper, apple peel and pear juice. Overall, this is an excellent example of an Imperial IPA, a great session beer, lots of flavor but still bitter enough to please a hop head. If you are a hop head, you will not be disappointed with this offering. Prost!"
""

"I drink this religiously whenever I visit my in-laws in the midwest. This is what midwest DIPA is all about. Burnt orange with an impressive off white head that sticks to my glass as I drink down. Bready malts balance a massive hop attack that is both bitterly delicious and very well balanced. Tropical fruits, citrus and cinnamon rolls greet the palate. The finish is dry and assertive, the malts and hops commingle as you swallow leaving you wanting for more. As a west coaster who enjoys the abundance of world class IPA/DIPA and their unique profiles I respect this brew as one that truly defines the regions resources to their fullest. To make things even better, Boulevard is now making these world class brews available for all us west coast BA'ers."

"O- This is a nice DIPA. It brings a change of pace from the incredibly bitter and piney, citrusy IPAs that I am used to."
""
""
"Overall, this is somewhat unique for a IIPA. I really like the emphasis on and pine and Earth rather than fruit. It adds a whole other dimension compared to some other beers of this style I have had. Really hope I get the chance to pick this up again."
""
"O- another great on from Boulevard. The smell is awesome and it tastes great. To me, their Tank 7 was hoppier than this which is strange to me as that is a Saison and this suppose to be a DIPA/IIPA. Either way it's a great beer and you should go out and get you some."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know how old the bottle was but the hop character was definitely not there. I am assuming it was pretty fresh but maybe it does have a better hop profile very fresh."
""
""
"O - Not bad but I thought it was just a bit heavy on the bitterness."
""
""
""
"Classic orange amber look, with a clouded body, and a three finger thick head gave this beer a very dense look. The smell was very strong from the open bottle, and intensified to mangoes (or peaches, which also smell similar), fresh cut hay, and pine resin upon smelling the glass. The taste was not as bitter as many others in the style, and gave this beer a woody, smoky, herbal character, which I believe comes mostly from the Chinook hops. Very clean and dry finish with apricot in the aftertaste. Very thick body, that feels like it could be chewed on. The sampler 4 pack of Boulevard Smokestack series has been full of winners so far. I am probably going to have to pick bombers of these beauties soon."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown (off for the style), nearly chestnut, with more than a finger tan head. The color is quite something to look at. This must have been bottle conditioned, as there are floaties suspended after a full pour. Malt is most prevalent with thick caramel and biscuit, hops have a grapefruit presence. Flavor is really caramelly with some wheat bread crust, bark and slight pine. Bitterness is nectary, flowery, and strong in the back of the tongue. Alcohol burn is noticeable, but not necessarily a flaw. Feel is slightly viscous, somewhat dry finish.  While this is solid, I'm just not used to such a malt prevalent double IPA. I'd really like some more earthy hops to go with the malt. I understand they aren't doing the whole West Coast hop thing, but I prefer hop forward IPAs. This is what a doucle IPA mist have tastes like in 1988. I'll try again, but my initial thought is that this isn't worth $12 for a four pack."
"Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Quite quaffable DIPA."
""
""

"O - I like this a lot. Looks great, if a bit cartoonish, smells like heaven, and follows suit with the taste. Wish it would be a little less flat, and would love to try it fresh."

"I’ve had this bottle in the back of my fridge for a couple of years; I wonder how it held up. This pours a medium amber color with a fairly fluffy head that leave great lacing. The scent is very hoppy, very inviting for an IPA. The texture is thin and smooth. The taste is crisp yet has hints of sweet toasted malts before it finish with a dry, bitter after taste. It almost has some oak characteristics as well in it."
"O - A very tasty DIPA. Now that it is in 4 packs locally, I will pick this one up whenever I can find it. Well done!"
"Was a more malt-heavy DIPA than I typically prefer but it's also a well-crafted DIPA without many flaws."

"Overall an OK not very fruity tasting DIPA."

"Overall a very good DIPA that is very deeply pitched and malt driven. A pleasure to drink but not for those who are expecting the aromatic fireworks and complexity of the better West Coast examples."
""
""
"O-a flavorful beer but I prefer more intense hop flavor and bitterness"
"This beer surprises the nw ipa drinker with a big bold ipa flavor without the strict bitter. The cork in the bottle should tell the story. This brewer cares when and how you enjoy it. Enjoy it often, enjoy it now. Don't take my word for it, try for yourself."
"O: I have to say I was disappointed with this beer. Unfortunately for me, the highlight was the appearance. After that it was downhill. Some people would probably really like it, but I like my IPA's to be hop heavy...especially the DIPA's. Too much malt flavor and too light for a DIPA."
"This is a rather malty DIPA where the hops can barely keep up. The alcohol is noticeable throughout, but it's not overwhelming. I prefer my DIPAs to be a little hoppier with less of a dark bread maltiness. This was good, but not my favorite. I did enjoy the pineapple notes, however."
"Pours a cloudy amber-brown with a fluffy off-white head that settles to a thick cap. Big aromas of pine resin, grapefruit, and orange peel. Nice, but not too unique. Taste is similarly pine resin and grapefruit heavy, with a substantially sweet caramel malt profile and moderate citrus bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, maybe a touch sticky, with a bit-over-medium body and ample carbonation. Decent DIPA, but nothing new or exciting."
"O: An average IPA which is very dominated by the alcohol. I might have been unlucky to catch a bad bottle though."
""
""

"Overall a solid DIPA that expertly balances a heavy malt presence with plenty of hops."

"O: Has its good points but never mind-blowing. DIPAs are the one thing we're spoiled with in CA, and it can be tough for an out-of-stater to match up. Still it's a good beer, no disputing that, and the price point is nice since so many beers are in overpriced bombers out here, so $2.99 for a 12 oz. bottle could be a buy."

"Picked up a four pack on Saturday for the big Michigan victory.Poured into a nonic a deeply hazed deep orange infused copper color with a huge blooming head that over filled the glass even with a pretty gentle pour.Aromas were deeply fruity and resiny with sweet alcohol.and caramel looming large as well.I found the flavors to pretty sweet with a lot of suary notes,the hops were there lending tropical fruit and pine resin notes but this is another sweet ladened DIPA.It's not bad and is alot like others of the style but it just gets to sweet and sticky after awhile....in my opinion."

"This poured out as a slightly hazy looking copper color with a big foamy white head on top. The lacing is clumpy and sticks really well, good retention also. The smell of this brew has a good hoppy aroma with a hefty amount of malt too. The taste of the beer gives off a nice malt profile in the beginning, soft and sweet, then unleashes the hops in the finish leaving behind resin like lemon flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated and medium bodied. Overall this beer was really quite nice, glad I managed to get a bottle to try."

"O - Super solid brew. Not quite east or west coast - just like Kansas City"
""
"Strong medicinal hop bite straight away. Earthy hops come in waves. Pine resin floats in the background, but brings a pungent sprucy bite. I know the hops have faded, because there isnt a citrus note in there anywhere. The malt is light and slick, and allows what was the hops to shine."

"O: 4"
"Had this on draft in downtown Easton, MD. Pours a deep amber color with very small white head. Aroma is massive pine bitter, some definite biscuity malts. Very aromatic. Flavor follows with huge bitter, pine, some biscuity malt, very little sweetness. Medium carbonation and rather dry. The was a one dimensional beer that didn't really impress me. It isn't bad, but the one note bitter was lacking any complexity for me. Not bad, but certainly not in the same league as the top doubles, or even close for that matter."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Boulevard is still relatively new to me, so I have been grabbing most of their beers as singles when I see them. I was pretty impressed by the unique flavor profile of this one. Herbal, hoppy, and fruity. Good bitterness, while staying in balance. I may not get it again, but that is more a credit to to my regular DIPA's than a knock on this fine brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and herbal hops. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."

"I'm going to have to agree with the brothers here, this is an exceptional beer. Mine poured a medium dark copper with some red because I was drinking it in daylight. On top was a thick, dirty tan head that started at about an inch and a half, dropped the inch, but the rest persisted throughout the drink, leaving a thick, scattered lacing as the beer level sank. I didn't think the nose matched the appearance. I picked up on some grassy notes, maybe some apricot, but to be honest it didn't jump out at me... The taste was back on target, with grass, pine, apricot and caramel malt rolling across the tongue to a significant astringency in the back of the throat, with heat from the alcohol. The mouthfeel of this beer is medium heavy from the malt, but hold it on your tongue and savor the bitterness. I'm a DIPA fan, and this one is good, really good."
"One of the maltier Dipa’s I have had yet with abundant hops as well. This beer is serious. Tons going on here."
"O: Like I said before, pretty damn good."

"A tasty IIPA that has some nice malt character to go along with the hops. I really enjoyed having this."
""
""
"Lots of caramel and malt up front with the flavor, I can't help but wonder if I had a fresh bottle what the hop flavor and aroma would do on top of that sweet base. As it is this is a bit darker and maltier than I am used to in an IPA, but the balance is very well done and flavors are clean, plus the body is quite rich and satisfying."

"I think this beer is nothing that's going to blow you away, butkus also not a bad beer. Not sure if this is a beer I would put on my must buy list."
"D: This was a great double IPA. I loved the scent and taste and body. The alcohol was well hidden, and the finish was smooth, so it was really easy to drink. Not the best in the world, but a solid brew. Recommended."
"O-This is actually an amazing beer. It doesn't pack a lot of punch or flavor, but it has a subtle greatness to it that makes it a blessing to drink and to share. Go out and get a 6 pack!"
""
""
""
"O: I like it, but it's not my favorite DIPA by any stretch. I could only ever have one of these in a sitting (during most circumstances), but I'd gladly have it again."
""
""
""
"O - I didnt know what to expect, but I am pleasantly surprised. This one isnt the best IIPA by far, but its suprisingly drinkable. Price point probably puts it to a """once in awhile""" beer but I wouldnt turn one down. A few critiques tho: there is a """wet paint""" smell that I cannot place but is persistent. Secondly, for a moderately priced IIPA, I was hoping for a tad bit more on the """wow""" factor. Overall though, not a bad offering."

"O: I'm still waiting for Boulevard to wow me. I'm right here...still waiting...."

"Moderate body and lightly carbonated really help this beer show it's best qualities with a slightly drying finish. Overall I really love this beer. It's quite nice."

"Stellar looking pour. Deep copper with a thick light tan head that leaves gobs of lacing. Aroma is weak for a DIPA (age perhaps?), but has an enjoyable pine presence on the nose. Body is thick with a caramel sweet maltiness, but a dankness from piney and earthy hops a hint of fruity hops is in there too. Bitterness is evident and is cut by the residual sweetness well. I prefer less malt in a DIPA, but considering its age the hips had hung around decently well. Best be finding this fresh next year..."

""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 01/27/13. Pours a dark reddish orange, with a two inch off white, that leaves plenty of lace. Smell is citrus Papaya, mango, carmel, and cut grass. Taste is all of that, wish it was a little more grapefruit in the finish, but it has some. Body is large, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and easy sipping. This was a Solid DIPA and a surprise from my friend Tom."
"Pours a caramel color with a thick, foamy head two and a half thumbs width deep. Nice lacing. A nice caramel base giving some off some bread, a nice hit of lemon zest sits atop it. A little too much alcohol shows up in the flavor, alongside what I can only think is some butterscotch, and bread. Not too much citrus or hops of any kind really. Medium bodied mouthfeel, some activity. Overall, a let down. Perhaps this was just an old bottle 'cause given the reputation of this beer, I expected a lot more."
""
""
"So this is the best IPA I could find from OKC, Little Rock and Memphis. Sad. Actually found a Flying Saucer chain that had Palate Wrecker (Memphis) from GF that of course blew away any prior hops. Oh well."

"Very balanced attack here, with plenty of malt character to make the hops seem tamer than they actually are. This is a bit of a hop bomb and I'm not complaining because every sip was enjoyable. Now that Boulevard is here in MD, I'll probably be looking into more of their stuff soon."
""
""
"O- Love it! Great flavor, great balance, perfectly carbonated. Boulevard was just introduced to the Baltimore market at the excellent beer/wine/liquor store """The Wine Source.""" I would have one of these any day of the week."

"Overall, good but not great."

"Pours a hazy amber red color with a large white head that disappears quickly. Scent is a ton of fresh citrus with a lot of lemon. A TON of citrus! Some nice grapefruit and hoppiness. Taste is initially citrusy with a good amount of caramel malt. There is a ton of lemon and some grapefruit. Alcohol and hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is an okay DIPA. Nothing too special."

"Overall this is great beer, bad crazy appearances aside."

"A solid and decent DIPA. Excess hop oils aren't my friend - too distracting, but in this case they aren't too much."
"O: Call me crazy, but this is a great brew. I love the risks taken here. Could have phoned it in with your basic DIPA, but they did something different and it pays off. Great beer. Everybody has to try this once. Bravo!"
"O: Nice, I'd order a second and would buy again. On the cusp between 1st adn 2nd tier of DIPAs. Better than 90 minute, but not as good as Pliny or Short's hop bombs."

"I like the Double Wide IPA and I like the Single Wide too. Usually double IPAs are more flavorful but for some reason I really like the Single Wide more than the Double Wide. Does anyone else here think this besides me? The Double Wide seemed a little bitter and bitey and the Single Wide seemed much more of a fresher hop taste."
""
"A pretty good beer if you can get at the right temperature. The smokiness is certainly unique and works."
""
"Overall: a nice malt forward DIPA with the booze well hidden."
""
""
""
"O: A great beer. One of the better I've had recently."
"one of the best double ipa's ive ever had, no kidding. pours surprisingly dark, caramel in color with a lacey tan head over an inch tall. looks eerily dark ruby red when held to the light. perfectly clear. smells like toasted malt, sweet buttery caramel, and a whole lot of pine resin hops. flavor is incredible, balanced in ways ive never tasted for a beer of this magnitude. while the hop aromas invade the nose, the semi sweet fruity malt palate goes to work on the tongue, stirring up excitement for what is to some. then the hops appear in the taste, big and robust, but not overly assertive in that rude sense. they sort of ease their way in and out, a big presence in the room, but not an obnoxious party guest. they merge perfectly with the complex and seductive sweet malt profile in excellent proportion, and sort of slowly fade off together. the feel is great, fuller bodied and well carbonated. this is a beer that needs more recognition, it is sensational, like all the smokestack series beers have been. wow i cant get enough of this."
""

"Quite a different DIPA for me. Leans towards the malty east coast style more than a west coast citrus bomb. Not something I would see out but a good brew."
""
""
"O) My initial impression was negative but I quickly turned and enjoyed this beer. I will have another, thanks."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great heavy ipa, very hop forward, strong citrus notes, nice to look at and intense"
""
"o Would buy again, but not for any regular drinking occasion. The high abv dryness may be truer to the origin of the style, but I do not know if I am in love with it. Of course, it was a four-pack... and I am going to thoroughly enjoy the remaining three."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very balanced IPA with good flavors. Definitely no as hopped up as a West Coast IPA but a very well crafted beer."
"While plenty bitter, I might appreciate more hops in the aroma and flavor. However, I also like that Boulevard is not following the standard hop explosion with little to no malt character."
""
"Bottle in a pint glass. This is a dark golden color and fairly fizzy. The smell has quite a bit of honey and citrus characteristics. Taste is heavy on lemon and orange peel giving a somewhat unusual kind of bitterness. Alcohol is masked fairly well. An all around decent IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice tasty dipa. A lot of malts on there with earthy and woody tones, but it's extremely drinkable. More so the heavier, yet easy drinking double IPA, than the subtle and esoteric interpretation. I can dig this. Fairly easy to drink and well executed."
""
"Decent beer, but the world is full of amazing DIPAs, this one is not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a really good one. a bit maltier than hoppier, and a bit more leaning towards bitter than floral/citrus (or balanced). haven't had many that i can compare to this. definitely a sipper!"
""
"O: Now this is a great, malty brew, a beer that breweries should look to for DIPA inspiration. A good IPA should be all about balance, and that’s exactly what you get from Double Wide: a complex malt base with an attractive hop presence to keep it interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid here. Dark hue with a decent head, but settles quickly and not much lacing to speak of. Nose is complex and full-on though. Malty, and sweet, with a nice hop. Well done. Flavor is not characteristic of the nose. Nothing off-putting, just the full nose does not lead into a full flavor. Still a nice balance though, and good follow thru. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Is a dark orange with off white foam. which dies down to a little patch that sits nicely the whole glass. The beer is well carbonated and feels substantial. Not a watered down beer by any means. The intense hop finish is there but not enough that that is all you get. Fruity, citrusy, and tangy. Enjoyed out of a Boulevard glass that came with a four pack. Quite impressive young skywalker...."

"Pours a slightly hazy amber/orange with 2 fingers of off white head. The smell is very aromatic, though not quite as hoppy as I have come to expect from DIPA's. Lots of caramel malt notes with some mid range fruits behind it. I keep getting an apricot flavor with some citrus and pine hop notes behind it. The taste is more of the same. The bitterness is not harsh but has a nice soft roundness which comes off as tea like. Mouthfeel is good, easy drinking. Overall this was not a super dry pine hop bomb of a DIPA. Instead it was balanced, had some unique fruit hop flavors and the tea bitterness really rounded and integrated the beer for me. I will definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: I enjoyed this beer, but in this day and age with the hop-bomb IPA/DIPA pissing contest still rampant among brewers I feel like it will get lost in the shuffle."
""
""
""
"An average, drinkable DIPA. Nothing more, nothing less."
""
"O- Really nice, I'd prefer I wider hop profile to balance out the thwack of grapefruit."
""
""
"Overall: yum. A nice effort at balance in a double IPA -- the hops are there, to be sure, but it's not a total """how bitter can we make it""" hop bomb. Would drink again if I could find it. At 8.5 ABV, it means business."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a very dark, cloudy orange with a generous 2-3 finger head. Beer has a light nose Minimal hops, and a good dose of malt. The taste however, is a straight up malt bomb. Granted, there's also a large hop presence, but it's extremely bitter, and still takes a back seat to the malt. The mouthfeel is extremely boozy. This is the opposite of smooth. The bitterness really lingers for quite some time. Overall, this is decent at best. I don't expect to revisit this anytime soon."
""
""
"O: This beer isn't sweet enough. Other than that, it's a pretty damn good DIPA."
"O: I would definitely get this one again if I found it. I like a bit more bite in my IPA's, but this was a nice treat for sure. First beer I've had from Boulevard but after this it definitely won't be my last."
"Amazing beer ..great floral and fruit aromas. Very nice red is caramel color. Head is carbonated bubbles and an off white finger and a half full of aroma. Taste is full of fruit and juicy flavor finishes clean and tinge of alcohol. Great beer. 9.5 out of 10 only because the rochefortes and st. Bernardus abt get my 10's"
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass, batch 1-2012. This pours a nice orange color with a massive tan head, I'll have to wait a little while for it to go down before I can partake. The smells are of pine and grapefruit a decent amount of caramel and some fruit sweetness. The feel is medium, the taste is pretty good not quite as hoppy as I expected, but very good, lots of sweetness and caramel to balance it out. Nice brew."
""
"Overall a decent beer, nothing special and kind of lacking in smell and taste. Could be due to age though, not exactly sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel isn't bad. A decent balance between bitter and sweet. A good carbonaltion level and it's warming to the mouth (and then the body). More of a winter IPA in my opinion, not one I'd have in the summertime. Starts swet and smooth and finishes with a slight bitter tite. Not bad, but not a regular IPA or DIPA in my opionion."
""
""
"O: I think this is a decent DIPA, but I was expecting a little more from the hop end. I understand that this bottle is getting close to it's """too old""" date, but I feel like it should still have present some more citrus aspects. If you are a hop head, you should just pass by this offering."
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Golden, amber color. Well carbonated. Two fingers of head on the pour take a long time to dissipate. Lots of lace up the side. Very complex aroma, with floral, hoppy and licorice notes. Caramel malt also comes through. Very strong, alcohol taste, with well-balanced bitterness and sweetness. Finishes bitter. Lots of body and lingers in the mouth for some time. Overall, an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Overall, a very good DIPA, on the sweeter side of the style, surprisingly drinkable and well balanced."
"The flavor isn't what I expected for an Imperial IPA. I thought it would be more hoppy than malty. It's almost boderline barleywine in flavor and mouthfeel. I wonder if I bought an old bottle?"
"Overall - This is an extremely floral and citrussy DIPA. Like being in a field of fully bloomed flowers and citrus trees. The flavors are many and complex and nicely balanced. I keep looking at the glass too, such a beautiful beer to look at. Not a hop bomb, but if you like floral and citrus hops this is a must try. I really enjoyed this, definitely recommend a try."
""
"I have been on a West Coast IPA kick, but if all East Coast IPA's were like this, I would be hard pressed to make a firm decision. This is perhaps the best I have ever had of the East Coast class (yes, including HopSlam)."
"Love the dark golden hue on this DIPA. Strong lacing never, never leaves. Aroma is thick of malt, grapefruit and hops. There is a strong citrus taste but the malt profile really shines on this one. I get a bit of the pine and some grapefruit along with the strong malt backbone. It is somewhat refreshing to have a DIPA that is put together this way. This is a fresh bottle and damn it good. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable. Love the kiss of bitterness that lingers."
""
"O- I like this beer a lot. The appearance and the mouth where the best parts of this beer for me. Finally a beer from Boulevard that really impresses me."
""
"Oh yeah, this is a solid Double IPA that is more balanced than your typical beer of this style. It's a hoppy IPA for sure, but keeps everything in check."
"overall - 4.5/5 - A very enjoyable double IPA that doesn't disappoint."

"Picked this one up in Durango at the Star. Nice to see they do this in a 12 oz bottle now. Yeast in suspension for a long time. Poured deep orange for 1/2 the bottle. Smells good. Pineapple and tropical fruit. Taste is overly bitter. They could have backed off a bit on the bittering hops. Good mouthfeel. Decent, but poor presentation."

"Huge, creamy body! Wow, this does wonders for the beer. I really enjoyed this one."

"Overall: IPA's so far have not been my favorite genre of beer, but I am beginning to acquire the taste a litte more. I expect an IPA to have some bitterness or it wouldn't be an IPA, but I thoroughly enjoy how the bitterness works in this one. This is the third beer in this special 4 pack that came with the tulip glass and I have liked all of them so far. Good going Boulevard."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip, best by 02/24/2012. Pours hazy and cloudy reddish orange color with a huge 3-4 fingers of dense khaki head with incredible retention that reduces to a lacing cap. Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big orange, pine, spiciness, caramel, grapefruit, and some light tropical fruits. Some nice and fairly standard aromas. Taste of big pine, orange, grapefruit, spiciness, bread, and light tropical fruitiness. Nice amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine resin, citrus, caramel, and spiciness for a good bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel that is pretty nice. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming on the finish. Some nice balance of flavor and bitterness. Overall a very nice and enjoyable DIPA from boulevard."
""
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Piney hop nose and flavor is piney hops nearly balanced with caramel, piney aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma. Best by 3/31/12."

"amber and very clean. Some light carbonation could be seen streaming up from the bottom of the glass throughout the session leading to a nice two inch head of white foam that capped it off quite nicely. Faded down and left a nearly bare top but nice lacing on the sides and bottom of the glass. Aroma was pungent. Deep grapefruit hops and a ton of rich citrus notes rip through the air. Very fresh, ripe. Warming brings out some almost pineapple like notes and a nice alcohol warmness. Sharp, biting flavor. Crisp, clean and fresh. Raw hops shred the palate and bring tons of grapefruit and alcohol right up front. Damn this is strong, two pints in and I am feeling it for sure"

"Overall- If you like beer with a lot of hops then you will like this. A pretty good brew even though it is just a tad bitter for my tastes."
"Overall, an excellent balance DIPA. I'm not sure I've had a DIPA that has been this balanced. I've had better, hoppier DIPAs and worse maltier IPAs but this one strikes an excellent balance."
"Good malt start to the beer. As I hold the liquid in my mouth, the bittering hop takes over culminating in the post-swallow aftertaste that lasts a long time. Slightly below average in body with a neutral carbonation. Classic Imperial IPA flavors."
"O: If you are into a huge amount of piney hop flavor and don't want a lot of malt body flavor, this is the beer for you. It is pretty far off of the style brewing standards, the hop cloudiness, and the over carbonation are all negatives. I wish the taste lived up the the aroma."
"Overall: Refreshing beyond belief. One of the best ipas I have had in a while. I love how the citrus just jumps but this never gets to be too bitter. A great beer."
"overall: wish i could have tasted this fresh instead of almost a year old. the lady in the store i bought it from said it has a shelf life of 13 months, but could have been just saying that to get me to buy it. if the age has taken a lot of the flavor away, then this potentially could be a great beer fresh. right now its just another good DIPA, but I've had plenty that were better"
"D: Overall, this isn't one of my favorite DIPAs, however, it is still pretty tasty.  A little subdued in the aroma; however, the taste is a little more complex.  Again, nice transitions, with a nice bitter finish.  Not one of my favorite Boulevard beers, but it's worth trying."
"O - An excellent beer!"
"O: Really Impressed/suprised by this, This is either a hop heads beer, or a beer drinkers hop fix. Great flavor balance, complex, a really well crafted brew, I will have to try and find more boulevard beers around MA. A must try."
"O - must be an issue in transit. This can't be right."
"O: A welcomed departure from your more typical double IPA. Sweeter with more of a malty balance. I would certainly buy this again, and would recommend it to anyone growing complacent with their typical selection of West coast double IPAs."
"O: A truly great beer. Hoppy then sweet then bitter at the end. It is not superlative, but one of the most solid and least agressive IIPAs I've had."
"O- It's not a bad IIPA, but there are enough I like more that I probably wouldn't revisit this one."
"Eh, not bad, malts aren't overly sweet but are big, bitterness is huge with really no beneficial hop flavors to match."
"O - My first ever Boulevard brew, cant wait to try a few more. Very impressive."
"Overall, a very tasty beer but the lack of malt balance keeps this one out of the very top tier IPAs, however, that doesn't keep the beer from being very enjoyable and worth trying."
"Taste is quite bitter, a bit sweet and sharp with a lot of earthy mellow flavors. I think the this ipa would actually benefit from some age."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is a bit stinging. Drinkability is good, very well balanced beer."
"Pours a ruby darkfruit color with a large off-white head. Nice lacing. Wonderful fruity aroma. Good hit of peach, orange and lemon zest. Also a hint of evergreen. Flavor isn't quite up to par with the nose. Nice blend of hops. Really subtle citrus notes to start. Great bittering evergreen notes, slight dried fruit and caramel malt before a dry and bitter finish."
"O - A surprisingly delicious IIPA. Very satisfied with the $10.49/ 4 pack price. Would definitely drink again, but not something that I would search for."
"It's a seriously delicious Double IPA."
"D/O: While the sensory profile is a bit simplistic, focused on hop qualities that are distinctly of the Centennial cultivar, the complete DIPA package is noteworthy for the style. The pour produces a voluminous head, but the impressive display is constrained by the dark translucence of the appearance. This beer is not a risk-taker--which pays off, since it has been able to achieve legendary status among the mid-continent contributions to the style."
"I really like this. It's very solid and easy to enjoy."
"D - Not a great beer. This brewery could really beef up this beer with adding a bit of malt (and i stress - just a bit - because you never wanna overdo it with malt in a beer like this). Not bad, but not great. Don't see myself getting it again. However, I do love what I've tried from the brewery as a whole."
"O: I like this beer. It's definitely my style of IIPA."
"not my favorite DIPA, but decent. I wouldn't turn one of these down. sweeter take on the style than most, but it works pretty well."
"man. this thing is boozy. poured pretty flat, very murky dark molasses. no head. the nose surprisingly reminds me a lot of DFH 120 Min. Very malty, boozy, and sweet. Not much hop presence at all. The taste is quite the same, malty without a hop back, molasses in the aftertaste, slightly chemical (again, nail polish). The alcohol really comes out at only 9%. Flat. Overall, I probably won't buy it again unless its fresh (which i doubt out here)."
"Pours a cloudy golden brown with a finger head. Has a very malty taste, which reminds me more of a scotch ale than an IPA. That maltiness tends to overwhelm the hops, leaving this a far less enjoyable beer than Boulevard's Single IPA, which I rate very highly. I won't quickly return to another bottle."
"Just doesnt do it for me, the pine and grass leaves me with a subpar impression, not smooth."
"Overall a solid beer, probably something I should've drank right when I got it. The hop aroma was more subdued than I expected. Would be very curious to try a fresher version."
"Love this beer! I usually only see bombers of this beet but on a recent trip to St Louis I picked up a 4 pack. Perfect beer after a day at the office. Smooth drinking with just the right amount of bitterness. I now need to find a way to pack a bunch of this in my luggage."
"overall it's a flavorful, above-averge DIPA but certainly not a show-stopper."
"Overall pretty good dipa. Something I may get again."
"-Cheers"
"O - This is a solid, if not spectacular, DIPA. I would definitely have it again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"O - Overall this wasnt a bad DIPA, however, it isnt something I would actively seek out."
"Outstanding DIPA. Cheers!"
"Overall, I'd recommend this. It stands out as an above average IPA. It is not watery at all. The tastes are huge and good. Smells good. Fun to watch in the glass as it settles down. Yep, if you see this, try it."
"O/D-Pretty good. Not more and no less. Would not spend $8.59 on a bottle of this again. Worth a try but I sort of wish I had my ten bucks back."
"Almost through the local collection of Boulevard goodness. This bit pours a mostly clear copper-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. Like other Boulevards, this one's got floaties, but not too many. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light pine, light mint, light leek, and buttery caramel in the background. The taste is more malt-centric, with plenty of caramel coating the tongue throughout. The hops aren't gone, though, as grapefruit peel, orange rind, pine, very light leek, and light balsa weave their respective ways through the caramel cytoplasm (wow, some high school biology just found its way in there, eh?). The balance is great, actually. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a nice DIPA, well-balanced and tasty."
"A pretty malty and bitter DIPA, although with some interesting hop flavor, it is not for the faint of heart. Alcohol level is not very noticeable."
"Overall: this beer is hit and miss for me. It's not bad, by any means, but I feel like its flavor really gets muddled and it loses cohesion."
"Full bodied and firm--there's a lot of malt packed in here. Thick and rich and chewy. Plenty hoppy, but a bit malty version of the style."
"Pours a hazy orangish-rust color with a ton of fluffy off-white head. Wide spread lacing. The nose is pretty aromatic with malt sweetness, citrus, and pine. The taste has a nice spike of bitterness involved that is wrapped in some fruiter esters and pine. Pretty damn bitter. Likin' it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has ample carbonation that makes the DIPA worthwhile to try. overall, pretty decent brew that owns up to its style with good qualities."
"Overall- It was pretty decent, mouthfeel was great, but it had sort of some strange things going on. The cotton candy and taffy, was well, unexpected."
"Aroma is fairly strong, hoppy and woody. It pours a clear coppery brown with a very thick and fine-bubbled, if not too persistent, off-white head. Flavor is hoppy with woody and resin hints and just a whisper of caramel. Bitterness is minimal and not unpleasant. Lively texture is quite fizzy, like just-poured soda, leaving behind a bubbly tingle. Not outstanding, but worthy of a try."
"Yes there is citrus, yes they threw in some pine notes to try to keep it interesting, but it doesn’t quite work. Surely a beer that is so liberal with its hops could find that X-factor to really make it great? Let a twister rip this double wide up, maybe what is found in the aftermath will produce something better than what was there before."
"Pours a unfiltered amber color into my ccb pint glass. Great 1 finger head retention and beautiful lacing. Aroma of citric and piney hops with some malt to try to balance this dipa. Taste follows the nose, more complex than the average ipa. Bitter but keeps me coming back for more. This is a exceptional ipa. I'm beginning to believe the when it comes to boulevard, the smokestack beers are where its at!"
"O: I think this brew would have been better as a stand alone DIPA tasting. I think either I killed it with my tasting or the age might have killed it. I'd love to try it again, and possibly a little fresher. Appearance doesn't match the taste and overall."
" The taste is good with mild grassiness and some almost lemony citrus zing with a light sweet tropical fruit essence in the background, the malt plays a secondary role with some light spice notes from the hops, but they are primarily fruity/citrus tinged. Overall this is a decent double IPA, I didn't notice any alcohol and the emphasis on hop flavor pushes it which is a quality I admire. I think it is pretty astringent which is the only aspect I would knock it for."
"The CPJ"
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I'd love to drink it again. Unfortunately its no longer distributed here but I'd love to trade for it."
"Overall a great brew. A little warming, which would make this more enjoyable in the winter."
"Overall: Delicious and wonderful. The aroma is weak, but the taste and the mouthfeel more than overcome it."
"Big thanks goes out to Jerriko for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Bottled 03/11, Batch D10064. Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a deep red-orange with a three finger cream colored head that subsided to one and a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, sweet alcohol, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, citrus hop, earth, and bitter hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The hops on mine were a little muted, but it was a little old by IPA standards when I got around to drinking it though. Still good though to be fair. I would love to try a fresher one as the malt by itself was a little abrasive and really needed some bitterness to help balance it out. Still worth trying if you get the opportunity to do so."
"Overall a good offering but not the best dipa ive had, ill need to come back to this one."
"O- While it was a decent DIPA, it was a little too sweet for me. The bready malts took charge over the citrus and floral notes. Worth a try, but I'm a bigger fan of their other offerings such as the Sixth Glass."
"Appearance is a hazy amber tone with a good sized head. Smell has citrus hops, malts, lemon. DW tastes of caramel, hops, black pepper. The hops are not overboard, especially for a DIPA. MF is medium with decent carbonation. If you come across this, it is worth trying, but I did not find it to be exceptional."
"O - Like other reviews have said, this is not a hop bomb which the style tends to levitate towards. Still a really solid beer and worth a try. Glad I have 3 more to enjoy."
"Overall, I thought that this was a tasty brew. Considering that I find this to be one of the most competitive styles I am grading it very stingily. I would definitely drink this beer again and its worth a try for sure but there are better DIPA's that are easier to attain than this one."
"O: Solid brew, but doesn't do much to stand out in this category."
"OVERALL: This is a very easy drinker for 8.5%. If I didn't know any better I would guess it was more like 6.5%. This is a solid beer."
"This is the best Boulevard beer I've ever had."
"Overall though, a good beer. I enjoyed it a lot and will definitely have another."
"Libation: All in all a good DIPA for the price, though if I'm looking for a rock solid DIPA that will quench my hop tooth, this isn't the one I'll immediately turn to."
"Wonderful metallic and cardboard flavors emanating from the depths of the glass. A little bit of vague hop flavor. Kind've awful to put to my nose. Regardless, and heedlessly, perhaps headlessly, I purse the glass between my lips to achieve the taste. The oxidation of what may be a perfectly fine beverage was exquisite. If that's what they were going for, they did it well. I assume not, and I was unable to have much more than a few ounces. Fortunately, my dear lady, who usually is well-equipped with her tasting acumen, chose to focus on the strong bitterness and the not-overly-sweet nature of the beverage. Pity her soul."
"All in all this is a solid offering...easy to drink and refreshing without overpowering your palate."
"FASCINATING, MUST TRY!"
"o: not a bad beer, but not what i expected. I could have more of these in a row than most other DIPA's...though it would sneak up on me fast...that is for sure. Drinks well for the abv...wish there was more pop in the flavors though."
"Double Wide pours a burnt orange, lightening at the edges when backlit. The bone colored head is absolutely massive, 4 fingers of foam that comes as close to spilling over the top of the glass without actually doing so as possible. The head retention is decent, and leaves tightly grouped rings of lacing plastered to the inside of the glass. The nose is a little bit dull, which is a disappointment, but has a balance between caramel malty sweetness and citrus and slightly piney hoppiness that's right in my wheelhouse. It's not as absolutely bone dry as some other IPAs, but hops are definitely more in charge than in some more balanced, east coast versions of the style. The flavor follows suit, with a pronounced yet smooth bit of bitterness providing an intermission between malty and hoppy flavors. I was not surprised to find Centennial in the list of hops Boulevard used, as that distinct bitter grapefruit flavor I get (and am not crazy about) shines through. The body is pretty good, fairly middling and it lines up with the slight malt presence of the beer. The carbonation is surprisingly disappointing, given the voluminous head upon being poured. It falls a bit flat by mid sip and really doesn't help the hops truly shine. Boulevard's crafted a very good/enjoyable double IPA, but one that, to me, doesn't quite measure up to the best of the style."
"O - A very drinkable DIPA. Be careful because it would be pretty easy to take down the entire 4 pack!"
"D - This was not what I was expecting, very nice, very original."
"O: A very good looking beer. Sweeter than I care for."
"O- Very good beer overall. In spite of a weak nose, this beer just keeps getting better the more it warms. You'd never guess the ABV if you didn't know it. I'm pumped that Boulevard finally made their stuff easily available to me."
"O- I like it. As balanced as the aroma is, the taste draws from a whole other direction. It's a hop blast for sure, and pretty tasty at that. If you can get it I say it's definitely worth the try. I can see myself going back for more which I can do now that Boulevard is available in Chicago. Cheers!"
"O - Decent double. Harder to find, and good presentation in a C&C 750. Had this one a few years back and it blew me away. Now, it falls in line as just a decent DIPA."
"O: Overall this is a very nice double IPA. Not as strong as some of the others out there make this very enjoyable. Could use a little more bitterness however I think this one is very balanced, not too sweet and not too bitter. Doesn't stand up to some of the best double IPA's but definitely a very nice respectable offering from Boulevard."
"D ~ Pretty good. A little off."
"Finally picked up a 4 pack of this beer yesterday, craving a good, strong IPA/IIPA. Wish I woiuld have grabbed the hop rod or green flash instead. Poured a medium amber color with a big white head (very carbonated; kinda like the single wide). Aromas of apricots, faded hops and caramel. Medium bodied, with flavors of apricots, hops and malt."
"O: I found this to be an good example of a balanced DIPA. The malt held up well to the hops. I wish in the end it were a bit more unbalanced though!"
"O: A very nice DIPA that just misses the tier of the real top performers in the balanced DIPA group (GD Hercules, ST Unearthly). Still, I am glad I got the chance to try for sure."
"O: This is a great DIPA. After having so many west coast style IPAs lately, its nice to switch things up with a piney bitter and malty IPA. Definitely worth a try."
"O: Not something I would buy again but that is just my preference, I know plenty of people who enjoy this side of the spectrum of dipas."
"O- welcome to chicago, boulevard. a solid DIPA that has competitively priced four packs. very nice. ill try to work this into the regular rotation from now on."
"12oz bottle with best buy date of 07/29/11. Poured into a New Belgium globe cloudy orange with a off white head (slight green hugh to the head, maybe the lighting?) There's some hop notes in the nose but not much of anything else. As far as the taste . . . I don't really have the built up palette to know the difference between differen hops. That being said, I don't like the hops used in this. There's a sour flavor mixed in which I'm not sure if that's from the hops or yeast, but it's unpleasant for the style. And speaking of the Style, this is no IIPA. Which in Boulevard's defense they never actually say it is an IIPA."
"Smells almost barleywinish. Yes, there’s hops, but also a load of caramel and toffee. Fruity elements include raisins along with citrus. Boozy, too. Hmm. Flavor is similarly style-challenged; it’s certainly a tasty beverage, but more along the lines of a barleywine. A sharp cedarish bitterness is swallowed up in a wave of sweet malt and tangy fruits. A hint of something medicinal. The thickish, fluffy feel also seems out of place. It’s possible the best approach with this beer is to enjoy the “DIPA” designation and throw a couple in the cellar like you would any other barleywine."
"Overall really enjoyed it. It could stand up to bat with many West Coast IIPA's. Very glad I got to give this one a shot."
"Overall this beer is fabulous, well balanced and combined bringing forth a group of smells and flavors not necessarily common for the style or the US trends- sort of pushing a seriously pushed envelope- and pulling it off right. hope to land this soon again."
"It seems to be a medium bodied beer & is ok for me. Like I said, I'm not really an IPA guy but I wanted to give it a go to in an effort to expand my horizons. I'd have this one once in a while. Food would be a great pairing w/ this type of beer. In the end, as always, prosit!!"
"Mouthfeel is quite full and pleasurable perfectly carbonated. Really really full mouthfeel with a nice dry and palate drying stickiness. Overall this is a very good DIPA, not my favorite by any means but still great. My first of many to come from Boulevard."
"Overall. A good DIPA. Love the label and corked bottle. Champange for the trailer-park!"
"Very good brew...a bit pricey, but well worth the cost."
"Nicely balanced, full assertive carbonation, and quite bitter on the finish after the initial malt burst. Some acidic qualities throughout. Peachy flavors. Grapefruit, guava, herbal, balanced by the same caramel and bready malts the nose suggests, but as mentioned is washed away on the bitter rind finish."
"O: Wow. I haven't had this in a while, and it's quite a bit better than I remember. This will be one for those long months when Hopslam isn't available. For my tastebuds, a real winner."
"o - A nice DIPA. definitely not a hop bomb and the caramel and fruity malts come out a lot in the smell and taste. Smooth and easy to drink, would have again."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good DIPA overall. There is a date on the bottle saying 09/2011, so I guess this is the """best by""" date, so this may explain the oxidative flavors and aromas. I can appreciate a brewer that can take this style and make a drinkable beer out of it. So many in this category are just """hop monsters""" with no real regard for drinkability...they just want to have 10,000 IBU's printed on the bottle or some such. This beer is drinkable the whole time and is definitely getting better as it warms up some. I would drink this beer again, and if you are a hop-head, I would absolutely give this beer a shot."
"12oz bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy, darker orangish color. There was quite a good sized ecru head on it that lingers and leaves some lacing. Good nose. Citrus, pine and apricot are the main aromas. Not overly bitter. Well balanced with a hint of underlying sweetness. Grapefruit notes in the taste, good fairly full malt body backing this one up. Nice"
"Distinctive take on the style - not quite like any of the many West coast varieties I've tried. Pairs well with spicy food, as the bitterness cuts right through."
"D-This is an extremely drinkable DIPA.Maybe a slightly different approach than others but complex and structured with an ABV that is hidden well."
"This beer pours a hazy amber color with two fingers of foamy tan head that leaves a generous amount of lacing on its way down. The aroma is strong with citrusy and earthy hops. The taste starts with a little malty sweetness and then you get a hint of earthy hop flavor. It ends with strong hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated but this is a fairly decent IPA."
"Drinkability: This is a well made beer but I find it lacking as a IIPA. The hop profile could be pushed up a bit, especially in the grapefruit/pineapple or some other citrus area. I'm fine with the malt sweetness but for a IIPA the hops should bite deeper."
"This is one of the better DIPAs I've had recently... I'm a big fan."
"I really like the hop bitterness levels on this one, the flavor has a nice, layered complexity, and the aroma is quite pleasant. On the whole a very enjoyable beer."
"A worthy effort. I haven't tried the Single Wide IPA from Boulevard but will soon."
"Pours a cloudy light auburn color with thick chunky head that hangs around a while before eventually settling in to itself lacing the glass nicely as you sip. A danky citrus smell...this is a hop heads beer. The toasty piney bitter taste hits you upfront and melts into a sweeter grapefruit finish. the mouth feel is big and round with almost a sticky lip smacking finish that is pleasant and has you eager for the next sip. This is a very good beer but not something you could drink in session (unless your a hop head like myself). Enjoy and PROST!!"
"Drinkability - I'm not a huge IPA head but this one is smooth and goes down easy. I could put a couple of these back before tapping out on bitter overload. Definitely a good (D)IPA for anyone who digs the mighty bitter (not biter)"
"M/D: Medium bodied and on the drier side. Overall, a disappointment. Had very high hopes based on reviews and brewery reputation, but this fell a bit flat. Bottling date is unknown and is likely the problem. Should I get a fresh one and the review is different, I will rereview it."
"Conclusion: A very respectable offering in the DIPA category. Although not heading the list of my favorite DIPA's, I would put in the upper 20% of the class. I've had this beer a few times and I'm sure it will be a mainstay in my fridge."
"Double Wide India Pale Ale was amber in color and lightly hazy. It had a huge beige head with great retention and lacing. The smell was citrus and earthy hops with some sweet malts. The taste was grapefruit and piney hop flavor with some caramel malt and a good dose of bitterness. The finish was long hoppy and bitter. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium carbonation. Drinkability was good and the alcohol well hidden. This is a good Double IPA and worth trying out."
"Very disappointed. Not sure how this is rated A-. Use to DIPA's like Dreadnaught, Double Jack, Hopslam, Maharaja which are all in a different league than this beer."
"Okay, but not an all-nighter. If I want something hoppy but not fruity, I'd have one, but I still prefer to share my corked bottles."
"Was not impressed at all. Very surprised by all the love for this."
"d - good beer but a bit down the list of DIPAs in my mind."
"A very big, complicated DIPA with plenty of bitterness if you're in need of a hop fix. There is a mild solvent thing going on throughout the nose and flavor which detracts from the drinkability and in general my outlook on this beer. I really like the look of these new 12 oz bottle though!"
"Good well balanced ipa, very drinkable I wish I had more..."
"I don't know how Boulevard did it, but they've created a DIPA that takes everything great about an IPA and amplifies it. Most DIPAs I've had feel heavier and creamier due to the increased malt and hop presence and high alcohol. But This one remains crisp, fresh, and light. Thank you, Boulevard."
"M&D- A very drinkable beer. Has a little too much carbonation for me to be drank a whole lot of. Good brew overall."
"Medium to full bodied, well carbonated, finishes dry and bitter. A good DIPA, but not quite as good as the best examples of the style. I would buy this again."
"Drinkability: I enjoy this beer and it is quite drinkable given the ABV. I would give this one another shot."
"Drinkability- I was dissappointed in this beer which received generally high marks from BA. I found the excessive level of sediment in the beer unappealing. The """tobacco""" component that others consider a plus I see as a minus. I will be more careful in the future to avoid beers that have this flavor in their profile and not to rely on overall scores. Lesson learned."
"Poured into my dfh snifter- huge fluffy foam that filled to the top of the glass (guessing because of the bottle fermentation?), that lingers around for awhile. On the nose, I got some very pleasant caramel and toffee notes, along with some nice citrus flavors from the hops aromatics. Appearance- completely opaque and dark orange- very interesting and unique. Taste- the caramel notes are first to hit, followed by some nice sticky toffee flavors and then some mellow grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors. Mouthfeel- this one is a bit chewy, and thats my only knock on this beer- there are some solids in it too. Drinkability- incredibly easy, I could immediately open another bottle (and almost did, if I didnt have to go to work the next day!). An incredible DIPA from Boulevard that shows some great creativity and individuality."
"D: It's good, not amazing, but I would recommend trying it."
"Another excellent beer in the Smokestack Series. Big thanks to AlCaponeJunior for including this in our recent trade."
"Drink: This beer has a pretty decent bite to it, which taxes the palate a bit. Definitely more of a sipper."
"I typically am not a huge IPA fan, but this beer really hits the spot. I have had it two times now, both out of bottles(pints), poured into tulip glass. I also don't typically enjoy the offerings out of Boulevard Brewery, but this is just a good beer. I could drink this beer all night, unfortunately after about two I'm out on the floor like a rug. Yummy."
"Pours darker than most double IPA's, a copper-brown with a finger and a half of eggshell head that left sticky lacing. Pine, orange rind, and earthy hop aromas come together in one of the best smelling beers I've seen in a long time. Resinous hops bring a mixture of citrus peel, grapefruit, evergreen, and herbal notes, with a decent malt sweetness to balance it. Full body that leaves a sticky, increasingly bitter aftertaste. Too big and bold to be more than a sipper, but a single bottle is enough for me to enjoy- check it out if you can find it!"
"Overall I was a fan of this beer but it didn't do anything to really set itself apart from the pack. Still, it's worth a shot if you see it around."
"Solid DIPA."
"D: I am impressed. This is a solid brew with outstanding balance. I have had numerous beers that are more hops than malt, and I do enjoy that, however, the balance in this beer really seperates it from an average Double IPA"
"D: A little too powerfull to have more that a couple, but really delicious."
"One finger off white head, medium-slow dissipation with minimal lacing. Brownish amber body a bit cloudy, maybe my fault re bottle conditioned yeasties, some visible rising carbonation. Big hop hit in the nose, floral balanced with some grapefruit notes, caramel malts with some burnt brown sugar. Taste mirrors nose, very hoppy though good toffee notes, beer got more bitter on back end as it warmed, a big burly flavorful DIPA. Fairly full mouthfeel, average effervescence, a bit sticky. More of a simmer than a session beer. This was a very flavorful DIPA, but not sure I could do a whole bomber by myself, a bit on the boozy side."
"Good full hefty body, with enough carbonation to keep it lively. The first bottle I had of this was more on the peppery side with a good spice kick. Citrus flavors were absent, and the bitterness was tiring. This bottle still retains some of the peppery spiciness, but more citrus comes out. Bitterness is moderately full. Semi-sweet toffee-like flavors on the back end. This isn't my favorite DIPA for sure, but it was decent. I thought the Single Wide was average, and this is too. I'd have it again, but wouldn't go far out of my way to snag it."
"D: Not the best Double IPA, but suitable. Not worth $4, but good drinking. IF you like the style, pick one up; if not, grab something else."
"D -- A very approachable DIPA that won't disappoint lovers of the style but still wouldn't kill the uninitiated."
"D: An odd little DIPA, and I'm not going to seek it frantically since I can't get it in NY, but I'm happy to have tried it and will gladly do so again given the chance."
"D: Solid DIPA, especially for the price. Wife likes it, and she is picky! The best from this brewery I have tried yet."
"All in all, this is a solid beer. Not amazing, but good. Great to try if you have access and only hunt if you really enjoy the style, but don't trade anything crazy for this one."
"Drink- I only had the 12 oz bottle. I wonder if a 750 ML would help clear the air. A pretty good DIPA if you can get one."
"Mouthfeel: A little hot with medium body. Nice carbonation and a touch of stickiness to get you to the next drink."
"D: it's neither offensive nor enthralling. It honestly tastes more like a homebrew than a beer with this kind of distribution. I like the spiciness though."
"drinkability - i wanted to rate this beer higher but the mouthfeel killed for me - the flavors are big maybe too big - i am happy to see them package this beer in a 12oz four packs"
"Drinkability: My first ever beer from Boulevard and I am impressed. A decent DIPA that I would drink again."
"D - oh my I want more MORE MORE MORE MORE!!!"
"D - Very drinkable, nothing incredibly exciting or disappointing with this one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Every bit of medium bodied and very smooth drinking, this was the highlight of the beer. Very nice. It is a very drinkable beer, but just not up to the standard of other top quality DIPAs that are out there. Still I'd call it worth a try, but just don't expect a mind blowing beer for the style."
"In short, I definitely wasn't impressed with the DW. Very very sweet and light for a DIPA, yet still very slow drinking. Not a bad beer, but not one your typical IPA-lover would probably be thrilled with. Gorgeous bottle and art, however - love brewers with the stones to do 750ml corked bottles and rad artwork."
"Conclusion: This is a pretty tasty beer, but deft. not the top of the Smokestack series which, overall, is awesome."
"The flavor is quite enjoyable. It's fairly sweet and fruity, but not cloying and all of this character might not necessarily be from the malt. This is pretty interesting. The feel is slightly bitter with a mildly-dry finish. The feel is a bit creamy with a medium body. Pretty nice and unique; I'm a fan of this brew."
"Despite the feel, this is a very good DIPA."
"Best by date: 7/8/11. I had an Odell's IPA before this and while this is pleasantly more bitter, it didn't have the same upfront hop character jumping out of the glass. The aroms is a mix of sweet grassy and grapefruit hops with caramel malt. The flavor opens with a clean tangerine with light caramel and then big grapefruit. It finishes with spicy, herbal citrus and a long peppery aftertaste. This is a fine beer, but I'd like more bright, crisp hops."
"This DIPA is an orange color and appears slightly hazy. There is a nice layer of white foamy head that generates some decent lacing. The aroma is one of bold hops. The beer tastes decent, but not great. It finishes with a hint of alcohol and hop bitterness that hangs out for a few seconds after each sip. An average example of the style, I'd drink it again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"overall, this was a very nice way to celebrate my new job"
"The smell is a strong caramel, candy sugar and pine. This beer is surprisingly sweet but balanced enough to profile some of the piney hops. Grapefruit and orange were also present. Thick, chewy, kind of syrupy mouthfeel. It was tough to get through a 750 alone and the sweetness hurts this one a bit in the M&D categories. However, it is still a very good tasting brew."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it had some good hoppy and sweet flavors to it. The candied fruit like sweetness was different but pretty good in it. A pretty good beer overall."
"D - An IPA you can drink all day long. A tasty IPA but not overpowering HOPS."
"Overall, a rather good ADIPA that I can see growing into as I keep leaning towards more and more bitter hops. Another great offering from Boulevard. Highly recommend. Available here in TX. Rotation - I can see this being a player in the bitter rotation especially now that they will have 12oz bottles as well as bombers. [R;Y;BHT]"
"D: Great DIPA. Solid, a little different than a normal one of the style but still very good."
"This beer may have been rated lower than usual based on the fact that I've had some really amazing IPAs lately. It was a good beer but the bitterness that is often overpowering in heavy IPAs was prevalent in this beer. It has a nice aroma with hints of spearmint and an almost cotton candy sweetness of the malt. It pours marvelously with a full thick head and a delightful hazy cinnamon color and thick lacing along the glass. The taste was the most disappointing factor for me as the hops tasted forced and not flowing like a really excellent IPA. The alchohol is not expertly hidden but it is still tasty enough to finish the whole bottle with a smile on your face. The 8.5% helps with this. I really didn't taste much of a difference as the beer warmed up yet I would still recommend this beer not be too cold. All said, being a native Coloradan, this is the best thing that has ever come out of Kansas. I'll have to try some more of their specialties."
"An APA perhaps pushing the envelope on the Double/Imperial IPA border. Nicely hopped, with a hint of wintergreen in there somewhere. Oily hop notes, going a little fruity toward the end. Alcohol is a little rough around the edges. More of a sipper here."
"The beer pours a dark orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of pine and citrus hops with a tad bit of caramel malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of piney hops, along with some bitter orange notes. All of this is balanced out with some caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice IPA."
"D: It's a sipper, that's for sure, but that gives me more time to savor and enjoy this dandy brew!"
"D: Feels good all the way down. I could sip this all day, or only on special occasions."
"Drank with homemade, egg-rolls. Delicious."
"Overall, a descent beer but not a great double IPA."
"Notes: A very nice, balanced and tasty IPA. Not the best IPA, but a good one. I would gladly drink this again, it's just a good, tasty, well balanced IPA. Very refreshing."
"Notes: Big fan of the smokestack series, which judging from those I've tried range from good to truly outstanding. This is in the final group. Really memorable and recommendable DIPA. I feel tempted to complain about the effort it takes to get hold of one of these bottles since they lack distribution around here, but it also gives me something extra to look forward to when thinking of passing through the region."
"Does not hide the alcohol, so you know what you are getting. Very easy sipper."
"Very drinkable, but you'll still want to sip this one. We really love and appreciate the angle of more flavors versus trying to kill the palate with raw bitterness. Delicious."
"M- Super dry, pretty highly carbonated and medium bodied. It finishes pretty clean.""""
"D- I really like this beer. A really nice surprise. Im really excited for the rest of these beers Onion sent me."
"And for the final report... This rating is going to remain very high. This was a fine beer in any capacity, IPA or otherwise."
"Poured into glass and had a very large head. Almost to the point of overcarbonation but once the head fell, carbonation contributed to good mouthfeel. Copper to almost red in color. Smell was great, I love the smell of hops. I couldn't pick out a specfic smell other than """hoppy""" but was very inviting. Tasted beer and all I can say is GRAPEFRUIT! Not completely overpowering but the primary flavor is definately grapefruit. Hunting a little further and you can taste the sweetness of the malt before turning to grapefruit. Very drinkable and overall a very good beer. A good double IPA which is not just bitter like a lot of other imperial/double IPA's. Has good balance and is easy to drink the whole bottle in one sitting. Good beer, cheers!"
"The body was decent, just a bit thinner than I would've hoped for. Drinkability was very good for a style that I rarely have multiples of. Overall, a pretty good beer, worth trying."
"It is a skip, for the price it isn't worth it."
"D - Tasty IPA. I am not extremely familiar with Boulders releases and think this would be better in a 6 pack and not a special release 750."
"D: for this much flavor and a reasonable ABV, I think this is a winner of a DIPA."
"Double Wide is a fine, fluffy and sweet DIPA that is interesting and absolutely worth your time - especially if you've been burnt out by the teeth-whitening bitterness of American Double IPAs lately. Very much recommended!"
"Glad this beer is not overly sweet, and the bitterness is noticeable. Thanks Boulevard!"
"Beer leads off with a chewy medium body feel to it. Strong hop flavor and building bitterness. Very strong pine. Pretty sweet up front from both the alcohol, which I can taste, and some malt syrup. Bitterness grows and grows. I had to drink this beer by myself and it shut me down for the night. Still a pretty good beer though."
"This is a bitter sipper, full of flavor."
"Drinkability? For an American IPA, I'd say it is excellent. Lots of flavour with minimal alcohol intrusion. I see on the label that this bottled conditioned beer can be cellared. I think I'll give that a go and see what happens."
"I'm not so sure, but this should probably be listed as a DIPA. It's very big to be a normal IPA. Double wide has a fantastic blend of flavors in the malts and hops. I particularly enjoyed the spice mixed with the chocolate and caramel. This beer is very dark for an IPA and has a head that was too large otherwise the appearance score would have been higher. I'm a big fan of bottle conditioning when done right and boulevard seems to do it right consistently, although this one did overrun a bit when opened. It still had an amazing consistentcy I have never encountered in an IPA. Overall, a unique and fantastic beer."
"Big beer...And I like it."
"a consistent beer from a consistent brewery. a tad on the lighter side in density in comparison to most. color is an orange... mild murk and a nice head that isn't particularly lacy. nose of grapefruit and orange... palate of a little pepper and mango. a little bit of booze came forth. definitely cenntenial hopped. good beer. losses some appeal with the traces of alcohol."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a sweet maltiness and piney hops. In the taste, piney hops and big maltiness in the end. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry piney hop aftertaste. Good balance with the big hops."
"D: Good IPA but wont drink it again."
"Great price. Cool bottle."
"D - Not tough to drink but not all that pleasant either. I'm glad I tried this one and would drink it again but I won't seek this one out."
"Whatever you do, the beer wants to foam. The slowest, most careful pour still yields three plus fingers of eggshell white microfoam, could not have a more frenzied, whipped up froth if it tried, curiously it slides effortlessly down the glass sides with minimal lacing. Cloudy copperish red-orange, you can just see through it, your fingers are shadow puppets on the other side of the glass, lightens around the rims. The nose can jab you but isn't out to score points, the first sign that this is a beer content to just be an """American IPA""" and not a wannabe DIPA. Scents of tangerine, lime, pink grapefruit mesh with pineapple, papaya, peach, apricot fruit, more floral than piney but in any case appears fresh and ruddy cheeked the first concern, vague dusting of cocoa powder, just hits you with the categorical basics with dignity and reserve. Medium-bodied, same demeanor as in the nose, maybe the carbonation adds a little too much fluff. Otherwise, very balanced with an emphasis on that tangelo, pink grapefruit citrus as well as pine and then caramel, butterscotch and honey. Never too sweet, just lively, there's a pleasing herbaceous nip to it. Calms down as it gets near the finish line with elevating carob, chocolate notes. Manages both a clean and lingering finish. Drank the 750ml is about 20 minutes."
"twister proof but blister inducing on the tongue as well as the brain."
"Overall I think something went wrong with my bottle. I had this beer earlier in the year and it was amazing, but something just seems much different on the second go around. I'll have to revisit this next time it is released and see if I can get a fresher bottle."
"-over all a good IPA"
"D: This beer seeks balance but in an unfortunate way. There's no equality between the hop and malt profiles. Instead, its just one... and then the other, with no compromise between the two flavors. Not one of my favorites and with so many solid IPA's out there, I'll skip this one next time."
"Very nice beer overall. Very happy I got to try it. Looking forward to working on the assortment of Blvd Smokestack beers that I've acquired over the past month. My only real complaint is that the cork was tremendously difficult to remove."
"D-A fresher bottle than I had the last time. This one comes together nicely with an easy drinking combination of caramel malt and citrus zing!"
"D-I'm kind of having a hard time taking my time with this one. I just want to keep drinking it. Is it the best DIPA I've had? No. Is it insanely drinkable? Yes, it most certainly is."
"P.S. Whoever is setting the best before dates must have a much different approach to Double IPAs than I. I can't imagine this would be nearly as hoppy a year and a half from now. All the more reason this one deserves a bottled on date instead."
"D- Overall I was disappointed with the hop presence. Very one dimensional."
"D - A little too malt-driven for my taste, though it's a decent beer. If it were easily available, I could see myself drinking one from time to time, but I don't feel it's worth going out of my way to get."
"D: This is pleasant to drink. I split the big bottle with my girlfriend and didn't find it at all hard to rip through. I found this to be a good, enjoyable IPA, but not an elite one."
"Alcohol is reasonably well-covered, as mentioned above, though does grow more as it progresses. Black pepper also grows, again - as mentioned above. It is a big brew, with an interesting complex hoppiness. An enjoyable hoppy sipper!"
"A medium to dark color is poured in the glass with touches of garnet appears at the top of the glass. A thick two inch head, beige in color, that laces slowly and clinging to the sides of the glass. A juicy citrus aroma comes right out, very dominant, the aroma is strong and can smelled from across the room. That is soon followed by a grass and pine fragrance, then ending with a hearty malty and bread scent. The malt is hearty on the palate, but it does not last very long. A hop onslaught occurs, bringing intense citric flavors of grapefruit, pineapple, and lemon. Other flavors like grass and earth show up, but they cannot overtake the citric flavors. A medium to slightly heavy body that stays consistent all the way through. The back of the palate is left with a medium dryness. A very strong offering to sip on, with the dark and enticing color, along with the intoxicating aroma, intense flavor and finishing with a pleasing feel, puts this beer in the hopheads delight category."
"Unique take on a DIPA, but the pepper brings the drinkability down. Nice to try, but I wouldn't reach for this one again."
"Overall, this IPA was quite odd, from the color to the pepper and the amount of malts used. I probably wouldn't want a full 750 of this. It isn't the most drinkable."
"D: This isn't your typical hop bomb. That being said, it is nicely blended, and a good take on the style. Goes down easily and somewhat filling. I'd definitely have this one again."
"A very drinkable ipa but a bit too much caramel for my liking."
"A lot of IPAs don't come in 750 mL, so that's kind of cool. It's a different take on the style, but it lacks the boldness in both hoppiness and malt balance that I'm used to from IPAs. By no means a bad beer, just not upper tier."
"Considering the ABV, this is an incredibly drinkable beer. Plenty of flavor, great texture, and just a touch of alcohol without being overpowering. I feel like I could drink a few of these, and that would be dangerous at 8.5 abv. A great DIPA and one I will be happy to visit again!"
"D. Strong, full bodied beer but was easy to drink. I enjoyed and looked forward to every sip."
"A very nice beer with some strong cheese."
"I truly believe this bottle is past its prime. I acquired two bottles in September and drank one then and forgot about this one until now. I recall it being way more hoppy in the nose and not it is rather nondescript. I actually enjoyed this beer very much because it is so balanced and smooth but I can tell it is not what it should have been. I reviewed to style and while my personal feeling of this beer is higher than the ratings I want to give an honest to style rating. If I am interpreting the date code right this was brewed in mid-May. so it is 7.5 months old. My bottle that was 4 months old I recall being much better. I want to review this beer with a fresh bottle."
"Full mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Tasty beer, thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this one along."
"D - Makes full use of the 8.5% abv & is dangerously drinkable. Packs a lot of flavor & punch. Recommended."
"I will say we finished these glasses rather quickly It was easy to drink and quite good for an IPA"
"Pours an amber mahogany color with a yellow head so thick you could plant a flag in it, and after it slowyly disappears, it leaves a nice sticky lacing. Aroma features a distinctive pine aroma, with very subtle caramel and molasses notes beneath it. Taste is very subdued as a whole, with hop bitterness being the most prominent to begin, but balanced with a very sweet and short caramel finish. Makes it a very drinkable beer."
"D-Even with the 8.5abv this beer is very easy to drink, one must keep track."
"D= Looked and smelled better than it tasted, but that's not to say it tasted bad or anything. A solid DIPA that I would gladly drink again."
"D- The alcohol is hidden amazingly well and this is a smooth enjoyable IPA, just doesn't really have much oomph to it."
"Overall, my first sample from this brewery, and I'm impressed. Looking forward to the other two I have in the cellar."
"Great balanced hoppy, complex flavorful DIPA"
"Damn, this stuff is good. Overall, I would say it's a better version of Ruination. Pours a hazy mahogany color with dense off-white head and good lacing/retention. Smell isn't too strong, but I do get a fair amount of caramel and sweet malty backbone. A bit of citrus hops come in too. Taste is overpoweringly hoppy--big resinous, bitter, leafy hops give way to a nice display of some citrus hops... as it warms it's followed by a substantial malt backbone with some alcohol. Nice balance with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, somewhat creamy, although I was looking for a bit more smoothness... good stuff here for sure. The Smokestack Series is the real deal, IMO. Big ABV and hop character make this one a sipper, though a great beer."
"Poured into a tumbler after a five minute struggle with the cork (Why do they =ever= use corks?) it forms an impressive 2 inch tannish head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is a somewhat light amber and cloudy. The aroma is strongly of citrus hops. The taste is mainly the hops with moderate bitterness and nice malty sweetness. The feel is good and medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation and a clean finish. It's quite enjoyable but a little strong to drink all evening."
"A thick and chewy body with a resiny character and a moderately bitter, fruity, and dry finish. The alcohol is tuned up and it brings a little heat. Fairly drinkable, if not a little too sweet."
"I enjoyed this. To me, Boulevard's beers seem to be well crafted but not extreme. Even their smokestack series apparently strives to be balanced, and I found this quite enjoyable."
"D: Outstandingly drinkable for its style, although at 8.5%, a 750 should be plenty."
"Overall: Decent beer, but nothing that I desire to have again."
"D- a very smooth DIPA. only clocking in at 8.5% this one goes down very easily. 12oz is no problem. as long as I'm not driving, I'd take the whole 750 in a sitting."
"This beer was much better than anticipated, however I was expecting an IPA and this is really more of a DIPA (as if the name doesn't suggest it). Great beer either way."
"D: If you like hops, it's pretty drinkable, but nothing great."
"D. A good DIPA. Not over the top. Would like a little bit more of a hop taste, which could have been affected by the age of the bottle. Another winner for the Smokestack Series."
"D - Medium"
"D - No thanks. It was worth trying, but there are much better IPAs out there."
"Drinkability- A bit strong and heavy, personally I enjoyed the single wide more."
"D: A nice, almost balanced IPA, but this one was kind of rough around the edges. The woody flavor is a bit odd as well. Between the heft of the malts and the over extracted tannic bitterness, drinkability suffered. Not sure this one is worth the expense."
"On the high side of medium in the mouthfeel. This beer is incredibly smooth and easy drinking. Way too drinkable. This is disappearing fast. Very good beer."
"D- Another killer from Boulevard that really delivers."
"Overall, a solid but not spectacular DIPA. I would definitely get this if there was lesser choices, but the problem is there are so many IPA's out there, and a lot of them are better than this one. Still, a solid beer from a great brewery."
"Corked & caged bomber picked up from Friar Tucks in Peoria 2 weeks ago. This was way darker than expected, the beer pours murky, dark copper, with tons of tan foam on top. The smell is likewise ominous, a strong malt presence not only balances the hops but threatens to take over. This smells sweet and barley-winish, I want more hops. The taste is more malty than I'd prefer or expect, just as the aroma promised. The hops are west coast citrus style but are just totally dominated by the malt sweetness. The body is thick which fits the rich flavors, but it doesn't suit me and it certainly hurts the drinkability. This is among the worst IPA's I've tried, too strong and too much malt."
"I found this to a be a very solid stronger IPA. The hoppiness is very well balanced and despite the freshness of the hops starting to fade it is still very, very enjoyable."
"Boulevard continues to make great beers for the Smokestack series. This is very balanced and flavorful. I highly recommend this."
"Overall, this is a good beer. I can see things that could definetly be improved but it has the hop character with a bit too much EtOH and a mouthfeel that will make your mouth almost water from the dryness. I am glad that I got to have this while in K.C."
"D: Enjoyable but unimpressive."
"D: glad I split the bottle"
"Mouthfeel is okay. Drinkable? Ummmm. Nose is great, but the alcohol is just too strong. Needs to be sneakier. Just needs a bit mellowing it."
"This is a brew that I would love to have on tap. Balanced for such a big IPA, everything works together well. I would love to try this one on tap."
"D: You can't drink this all night of course, but it is a pretty nice example of the style...not the best but a good beer nonetheless."
"Comes out a cloudy copper-coloured brew with a decent head which dissipates a bit too quickly and isn't leaving any lace. A powerful citrusy, grassy aroma with more than hint of that smell you get when the rain hits dry earth - petrichore I believe it's called. Big citrusy hoppy flavour, good malt balance, and some hints of raisin, especially in the rather bitter finish. It has a good solid body to it. A very nice beer, although not for every day. This is a brew to be enjoyed once in a while with some looking-forward-to."
"Down the fusel alcohols in this one and it's a little bit more drinkable. Minor tweaks are needed with this beer."
"This isn't really an IPA, it's definitely a DIPA. Very dark caramel color with an off white head. Smell is very sweet and candied with a heavy smattering of malt. Taste follows suit, very thick sweet caramel malt smothers the bitter hops. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick creamy side for a DIPA. This beer was so close to a DIPA that I have no idea why they just don't label it as such. Even if it were it's just a solid to average one."
"Pours a deep murky copper color with a bubbly off white head. The lacing sticks heavily to the edges. The nose is citrus and sweet malt. The taste is very solid citrus hops with some sweet caramel malt as the big taste in the back. Mouthfeel is medium and a little slick. Overall a pretty solid brew."
"Flavor notes: Tasty hopped up ale, with notes of more mint, leafy, herbal hops and malty underpinnings.. Heady brew @ 8.5 %, but to my taste buds the alcohol is nowhere in the flavor profile. Quality stuff, I enjoyed every sip!"
"This is s good tasting, well balanced beer, but it's boozy for being 8.5% abv. The alcohol tastes more like it's up in the 10% area. This plus the sweetness makes it hard to consume more than a 750ml bottle in a sitting. Overall, a good take on a balanced IPA, though."
"This is my third Boulevard beer and I'm pretty impressed with their stuff. As far as the Smokestack series goes, this one lags behind the Sixth glass, but it is more than a solid beer. I'd like a little less balance and more hop flavor. That's just my preference for DIPAs. But, if you're into balance, this one delivers. It's definitely worth checking out."
"Verdict: Double Wide IPA is certainly a substantial and enjoyable IPA, though it just doesn't seem worth the nine bucks that I paid for the 750ml bottle. Well worth a try, but I'd feel a lot better about it if it I'd gotten a six-pack, or even a four-pack for the price of admission."
"Thanks BlueOkie!"
"- Overall not too bad! Very unique! Age? Probably not... but would be interesting... overall a nice English style dark IPA!"
"750 ml bottle, batch 08305. Pours a hazy orange-amber color with a fluffy light brown head, decent lacing. Aroma is a touch of caramel and biscuit malts with a good amount of citrus, mainly grapefruit hops. Flavor is mainly citrus hops, orange and grapefruit and also a touch of earthy hops when warm, backed by some sweet malts. Mouthfeel is medium, lively with a good amount of bitterness at the finish that sticks around for a while. Pretty good beer, best I've had from them so far."
"Pours a cloudy deep orange amber color with a HUGE stiff light orange tinted collar that fades slowly decomposing like an ice cream float with tons of Belgian lacing left behind to be enjoyed. The smell, while not over powering, is refreshing, grassy, pineapple and citrus hops with a balanced sweet malty character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Full flavored, the fruity citrus taste is balanced well with substantial sweetness. So tell me, is this a Double? Yeah, maybe. The sweetness and hop resin characteristics linger nicely on the palate. The 8.5% ABV is well integrated. Gordo...team Boulevard ROCKS!! Had a blast considering this one thanks to koopa!!! All is well and good in the Mid West. Highly Recommended. Cheers!!"
"Scott"
"Pours a very hazy amber color. It clears a bit if you let it sit for a while, but the haze never really disappears. The head that forms is huge - really huge. But it's very loose, the bubbles start popping, then it looks a bit like miniature swiss cheese, then it starts to collapse, leaving only tiny bits of lacing down the glass. I really enjoy looking at this one, but the color is just a bit too dark for my tastes. When the head is still at its peak, there's a moderate note of tropical fruits, backed up with a nice floral smell - a bit of pollen and some resins, and as the head falls back, you get a nice malt presence - slightly toasty, a bit sweet, caramelly, a tiny bit crackery, but still nice and dry as far as I can tell. The hops come off a bit more pungent, slight overtones of barleywine, kind of toeing the line between IPA and Barleywine in the smell. The taste starts out with a very nice battle between the hop bitterness and some malty sweetness. The hops seem to win at first, coming off a bit fruity, almost peachy, as the malt and alcohol begin to win, slightly bready, but not too sweet, with a nice toasty almost crusty flavor, with a light alcohol burn. Then the hop profile opens up again, with plenty of floral notes, this may be one of the most floral beers I've ever had, really delectable I think - leafy, slightly herbal, it's as if the springtime was realized as a taste in your mouth, that's about as accurate as I can describe it. And it turns out much drier than it appears to be, but there's still a very nice malt complexity to the whole thing. Much less citrus than you expect, but I think it still comes across quite nicely. I really like the mouthfeel, quite a bit less full and chewy than I expected it to be, which is very nice in this case. Good carbonation, a slight tickle, not too powerful. The body is actually about medium, and it's enhanced nicely by hop resins. Overall, I found this to be quite enjoyable. It's quite a bit different, and you've got a bit to get over in terms of the difference between this and the average american type IPA. I'd go for it if I could have it again."
"This is clearly a double IPA. Right now it's listed on this site as an American IPA. I don't know what the brewer considers this, but I'm guessing they consider it a double IPA as well. Look at the ABV, and look at the name, and then consider that they've got another beer called Single Wide. Do the simple math, and most importantly, just taste this thing. It's a wonderful, tantalizing, sweet, bitter, rind-y, resiny double IPA, ain't it? Who cares what you call it...it's just fantastic."
"D: My first beer from Boulevard (whom I've heard great things about), and I'm happy to say I was impressed."
"Mouthfeel is good, light and slightly gritty. Very drinkable because of the lightness of flavor (without being boring)."
"This pours a very cloudy dark amber with a big light oatmeal colored head and solid lacing. The aroma is a strong maple malt and butterscotch with pleasant piny hop, very nice. The flavor brings more alcohol over a malty pine hop. This has a fairly full feel and is very lively in carbonation. It has a hint of bitter chocolate and vague sherry at the back end. This is some high quality stuff."
"D - A very nice IPA - a little on the heavy side to be as drinkable as some of the best out there. Drinks more like a Double IPA. Goes down smoothly, but the heaviness keeps it from being a multiple bottle beer. One 750ml makes for a very good night tho on its own."
"D: This one was a joy to drink. Loved how the hops didn't overpower the underlying base of the beer."
"A great brew. Works well when paired with a nice aged cheddar. Well worth the effort of getting this from Boulevard. Everyone should try this one."
"A 750ml corked bottle shared with brothercannon and poured into a pair of nonic pint glasses. The ale appears a hazed crimson amber color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. The head leaves behind a minimal lace on my glass. Nose and flavor are of resinous pine, white grapefruit juice and peel, nicely toasted bready grains, sweet caramelized malt, floral mint, more malt. Pleasantly bitter, yet sweet as well, nice balance of flavors. Alcohol is barely noticeable, and the ale has a medium body with adequate carbonation. We were craving another bottle when this one was gone. Tasty stuff."
"Drinkability: The best DIPA I have tried in recent memory. Would definitely recommend and hope to stumble across more in the future."
"Drinkability: Way too well-aged, giving it lots of barleywine-esque overtones. The alcohol isn't too high, but it's a little noticeable here. I'm giving this one a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, but that's alright - I can detect a solid, tasty underlying beer here. This just isn't the best side of it, heh."
"Drinkability is isn't to high. There's a strong bite to this that reminds me of a fusel laden extract strong ale. Seems stronger then 8.5%. At least it was under $10 in spite of the cool label and corked & caged champagne bottle, as well as hyped up new arrival brewery. Still, will not be buying another."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is noticeable while sipping on this beer, but it's not out of line for the style. With the volume coming in at 750mL and the alcohol sitting at roughly 9%, I don't think I'd want another beer after this. This is a well put together beer though, and one I'd love to have again."
"mouthfeel is heavy and astringent in places. not a """drinking""" beer but a nice treat."
"Pours a deep orange with a big frothy head. Smell is sticky pine, sweet citrus fruits, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is crisp toffee malts followed by the piney hoppiness of (I think) chinooks and either cascades or centenials. The large malt base gives a barleywine feel to the beer. The hop bitterness fades to a sweet malt aftertaste accented by a slight pepper. A very good dipa, lots of character. The bottle says it can be aged but I'm not sure it would improve. Maybe the barleywine character would come out even more"
"This beer poured with a substantial wheat colored head that eventually subsided into plentiful lace. It was red in color, very hazy, with no visible carbonation. The aroma was somewhat subdued, definite hop notes, with some sweetness. Big hop punch with the first sip. The alcohol is noticeable, even with the substantial amount of hopping. The low carbonation is appreciated as it doesn't interfere with the interplay between the hops, fruity esters, and alcohol. Medium bodied, it finishes much more subdued than how it starts."
"D: The strong hops and the ABV hold this back a bit. Still a good beer and definitely worth a try."
"D: A good DIPA. It really reminded me of the Grand Teton Sweetgrass 20th anniversary. Both are the only time I though I should have cellared a DIPA. The grand teton I did for 3 months and I think this could have used a touch of time."
"D - This was a pretty good IPA, probably the best IPA I have tried that was made in Missouri. Will definitely buy again."
"This was a nicely done IPA from Boulevard with with some bold hops flavors and a really good feel and drinkibility to it, despite the higher ABV. This was the first of the Smokestack Series that I've had from them and it was a good start."
"Overall, this beer reminds me of buying a cd. sometimes you have to listen to a song a few times to start really enjoying it. I've had this beer probably 4 times and just decided to review it tonight. Good beer by Boulevard"
"Pours a deep murky brown with a fluffy 3 finger head in my pilsner glass (all I had available to use). Spotty lacing. Smell was caramel malts and a lemon peel-like hoppiness, maybe some pepper also. Taste was spices, and a huge caramel malt profile to balance out the hops. Not much bitterness. Medium bodied with only the slightest carbonation sting. Very drinkable, tasty, balanced IPA"
"D: We were so impressed with this. Our previous experience with Boulevard was with their Pale Ale and Porter. Very nice, but nothing like this. Awesome!"
"Pours a hazy burnt sienna amber color with LOTS of thick frothy beige head into a nonic tumbler. Great retention leaves lots of nice lacing blotches and clumps. Smells of pine resin, grapefruit, pineapple, spicy and peppery hops, caramel, and biscuit, very aromatic. Tastes of pineapple, apricot, and grapefruit up front followed by some sweet bread, caramel, toasted bread, and a bit of nuttiness. Finishes with some spicy hops and pine resin bitterness. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Sweet and sticky, nice balance with a firm bitterness. This is one great tasting IPA, not too high in alcohol but packing in excellent flavor. Easy to drink and delicious!"
"a very good IPA."
"I like it and I enjoyed it but it won't leapfrog any of my favorite examples of the style in my purchasing decisions."
"D: A rich and sweet DIPA of the highest order that appears less bitter than it's single wide little brother. Very good, and would probably morph into a pretty decent American Barleywine given some time."
"D=very drinkable, alcohol not extremely noticable,"
"D: Very drinkable for the style. Disguises the ABV well."
"Overall: The the mouth feel is carbonated with some astringency. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is a bit dry. The beer lingers on the tongue for a few minutes. This is a descent DIPA. I would have like to seen more hops with a little stronger malt backbone. I can't have my cake and eat it too. It is really not to bad."
"D: Hard a hard time because of the bitterness. I couldn't drink more than half the bomber so glad I was splitting it with someone else."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a bold IPA."
"Thanks for Reading"
"Judging on the Smokestack Series beers I've had thus far, I'd consider it one of the most impressive grouping of special release beers. If this Missouri brewery has any decency they will brew each and every again and again (and hopefully distribute a little further). Even long after it was at its most sassy and sexy, I've much enjoyed every last drop of this wonderfully crafted DIPA."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade. 750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a nice hazy copper with a nice frothy eggshell head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a bit of citrus hops and caramel. The taste is a very nice balance of abundant citrus hops and sweet caramel that leaves a nice bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied but quite crisp with decent carbonation. This is certainly a very refreshing and enjoyable DIPA, I'd love to be able to get this one here, there certainly aren't enough bottle conditioned DIPAs out there, and its always a nice touch."
"day sitting back sipping on this."
"D: if the ABV was a little lower I could definitely drink 2 of these 750 mLs on a good night, but could easily get down one."
"Drinkability: Other than the carbonation being way out of line for the style, this is a balanced DIPA that is pretty tasty"
"Pours a copper color with a nice sticky head. This beer smells more fruity than most IPAs, but there are some piney hop aromas coming off of it. Good flavor, grapefruit hops with a good caramel malt background. There is a nice alcohol warmth in the finish along with a grapefruit hop bitterness. Sort of simple flavors compared to other hop heavy DIPAs. I like the presence of the sweet caramel malts in this."
"Overall, unbalanced towards the hops and pretty watery washed out mouthfeel, but I like the hop aromas and flavors."
"Very good, up there with best of them."
"mouth is generously carbonated that is importent for the bittering that is here. Not oily like most DIPAs but kind of viscous and tangy like figs. Drinkability is moderate because I am so excited to drink this whole bottle."
"D- It's pretty drinkable. Not to filling and not to strong."
"Good beer, but not as good as I hoped. Aroma was midleading as the aroma was really nice but the finish on the taste wasn't all that great. Needs a bit better balance to, or a little more sweetness in the finish."
""""I think it smells like the dried pineapple in our trail mix.""""
"Drinkability - The lack of cohesion loses this one a point here, but overall its a fairly sippable brew. I just wish the hops and malt found a better medium, it seems a bit underdeveloped."
"D - This is my first double IPA. It's similar to a British or East Coast IPA doubled. Very malty, but balanced with plenty of tastefully applied hops. I'm from Kansas City so I have a soft spot for Boulevard Brewery, but I can recommend this to anyone wanting to try a well balanced double IPA."
"Overall: It's good but not quite worth it for the bomber. It is clearly a DIPA due to the 8.5% abv, but it seems it can't decide what it REALLY wants to be."
"The body is moderate but the malt leaves a sweetness that hides some of the hop notes. Carbonation is good. Some sticky hop notes, but really looking for more. This is good for an East Coast IPA that is super easy drinking, but the sweetness and lack of bitterness really leaves me wanting more."
"Overall this is as good of an IPA as I've had the pleasure of trying. If you like flavor over hype, give this beer a try."
"I'm not sure why this is listed as an IPA since it is clearly a double but who gives a shit right? nice orange color with a superb head liek whipped cream that just won't die. It smells like spicy hops, cinnamon, weird. The flavor is almost all malt and not bad until a funny plastic flavor shows up that I usually get from Belgians. Is this beer supposed to have brett (God I hope not) because I think that is what I am tasting. This beer was not bad but I would have been better of saving my $8 for a sixer of Odell IPA."
"Pours a clear amber color. 5/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops (sweet and floral) and slight sweet malt background. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet hops up front, roasted malt, and then some sweet malt. A strong general bitterness. Overall, a very smooth a great blended beer with low alcohol flavor for 8.5%."
"Overall very complex IPA, if not quite sessionable."
"Thanks to mhewes for providing this one in trade. Pours a deep copper color, with a ton of carbonization providing a huge 3 finger head, and foamy lacing as it slowly recedes. Impressive appearance that falls short in the aroma. I was expecting as strong hops punch, but couldn't find it. It was a very muted scent overall. I am surprised that the taste was this good given the weak smell. The taste is a strong hop bitterness up front followed by a sweet citrus aftertaste. The sweetness overtakes that hop dryness that some DIPAs provide in the aftertaste, which helps balance out the high carbonization that stings a bit in your mouth. In the end, a very tasty DIPA."
"Edit: the wife loves it!"
"An admirable IPA. I have to question the bottling, as I would expect an IPA like this to come in a sixer or the like. I suppose it was because it was Boulevard's first real stab at an IPA, and it was a very good for a first stab. A must-taste for IPA fans especially."
"Mouthfeel was less carbonated than expected, yet there was more than enough viscosity."
"Good but was hoping for a little more from this."
"RJ"
"I'll try again and reprise this if necessary as it seems my experience is an exception. I want to like this brewery, but this was my first Boulevard purchase. The liquor store has an impressive display of Smokestack beers, and I'd expect some turnover so maybe this one got away."
"Just checked the website, they refer to the hops as peach, apricot, citrus and lemon, which I'd say are similar to the sweet/tropical notes I sensed. They also list the beer at just 55 IBU, which is wimpy by most double IPA standards, but hey, it works."
"this is a beer that's not gonna blow out your taste buds. It's got a really nice sweetness about it bordering on addictive for me, but that's how I often like it. Just a phenomenal unique take on the style by Boulevard. Worth a try--do not come into it expecting a hop bomb! This is something else entirely."
"Honestly, I liked the 2 other Smokestack brews I've had even though they were styles outside my general preferences. Since I actually like IPAs I was expecting to be much more impressed by this brew."
"Drank the big bottle with ease. Opens up a bit as it warms. very nice."
"Would have this many times. It must be awesome on a fresh tap. Can't wait to crack another of these open again."
"I have to give this one a perfect 5. My first ever. I just can't find any flaws with this beer."
"D - Finishing crisp and with a great tropical hop bouquet, this is a fine IPA. A bit big on alcohol for a single IPA, the beer is still balanced and quite drinkable. I'm going to savor this for a while."
"D- This is a type of IPA that I don't come across to often and wouldn't mind seeing more of. The only similar example of the style that I can think of that I have had is Southern Tier's Unearthly. Can't wait to try more from this brewing company!"
"D= High! like i mentioned earlier the hops are somewhat subdued in the taste so it's easier to drink more. Pretty decent beer. Nothing excitingly special but pretty darn good."
"D - At 8.5% I should probably ony have one but could definately drink more."
"This is a really good IPA. """Full flavored""" comes to mind."
"D - Good and enjoyable"
"Champaign bottle 750ml"
"Not bad, but weak on the hops to be called a double IPA. I'd imagine that its much better fresh."
"Beautiful balance of resinous, piney hops with lots of caramel malts. Much closer to the category of Double IPA's in terms of complexity, as the booziness chimes in to add a rich sweetness to the finish that ultimately ends with pine and toffee notes. Mouthfeel is juicily thick and viscous, but not so thick that the palate tires of the experience; perfect carbonation level, too. Overall, an amazing introduction to the Smokestack Series. Aside their Bully! Porter, Boulevard hasn't really impressed me that much. That all changed with this beer, and now I eagerly await the other three SSS brews in my collection."
"quickly but then I slowed down. I think the strong citrus and sweet malt was a bit much after a while. Having said that, I would be happy to have this beer often if I could get my hands on it. Makes me want to try more Boulevard."
"Medium body, crisply carbonated. Lots of hops, and the beer is indeed very sharp, but they don't smack you in the head. Well balanced. I'm glad that my travels provided me with a chance to get a bottle, seeing as how it isn't distributed in my area."
"A balanced IPA that had the biggest non-Belgian head I've ever had. Sure, I like them a little more bitter than this, but still a nice beer to try. I'm glad Boulevard is expanding their horizons, they're a nice regional brewery."
"Verdict: I like my IPAs and DIPAs (this beer seems to be somewhere between IPA and an Imperial Red) to be 1) dry, 2) hop-centric, and 3) bitter. This beer is sticky, malty, and only a little bitter. It's a tolerable beer and it doesn't taste bad by any means, but it's a departure from my stylistic ideal."
"Pours a crystal clear red-orange color with a big fluffy slightly off white head that sticks around all night. Aromas of cascade hops came pouring out of the bottle just after popping the cork on this one. Lost of spicy pine, resin, and grapefruit with some caramel malt in the background. Taste is not nearly as hoppy as I would have thought from the smell. Defiantly the usual suspects in there but lots of caramel, some astringency. Definitely sweet, but not overly so. Finishes dry with a caramel hop aftertaste. Full bodied, creamy, resiny mouthfeel, loads of carbonation. Great IPA, wish I could get this locally."
"Both the single wide and double wide impress me with the ability to give an excellent hop character similar to casking without having to do it. A beer worth trying, no doubt."
"Well done Boulevard."
"smell is rich"
"Drinkability- Ultra drinkable, very flavorful and a pleasure to drink. I just wish the flavors came out a bit earlier as I don't think you should have to wait for an IPA to get to room temp to enjoy it as much. Still, a wonderful beer that is worth seeking out."
"A: Loads of dense, thick foam with a spider web of lacing along the side of the glass, the color of a murky iced tea, miniscule sediment is noticeable in the glass, interpret it as you want - but this beer looks like what I want an IPA to look like - 5.00., S: A wallop of citrusy hops, sharp crisp aromas, some nice malt sweetness is also evident - 4.50, T: A hefty dose of malt is present but the hops are what really define this beer, quite piney - 4.50, M: Thick and creamy - 4.50, D: A very enjoyable beers, one of the better IPAs that I've had, quite intense but not one that demands your constant attention - 4.50"
"I should have got 2!"
"This beer pours a hazy orange color. The head is a massive frothy white color. Lacing sticks around until the beer is gone leaving thick chunky lacing all over the glass. The aroma is mix of grapefruit, citrus, and floral hops. It is quite bold. The taste leans more toward the grapefruit and citrus with only hints of the floral notes that were present in the aroma. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than full bodied with appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a nice DIPA. I like how there is enough malt to keep it moderately balance, but not so much that it verges into barelywine territory. I would happily drink this again."
"Overall very good as far as flavor and aroma are concerned, but it's certainly a negative when you have to use a spoon to ladel out the foam just so you can drink it. Also seems a bit heavy for the style."
"This is an example of a big DIPA that is verging on a nice balance, but remains a tad bit too hop forward for me to enjoy it frequently."
"Notes from 5/2/08"
"D - A fine beer, just not real complex."
"Basically, this is very, very good. Double Wide exists in the wonderful little borderland between IPA and DIPA. It is perhaps balanced to a fault, especially if one expects a full-on DIPA. Whatever it is, it is a splendid offering from Boulevard. I really hope to have this on-tap again sometime."
"Pours a reddish brown color body..Big creamy head, lasting, okay lacing. Piney, hoppy aroma. Bitter pungent nose with some sickly sweetness. Balanced taste, some grapefruity taste. Watery body, some carbonation. Not a strong flavor. More aroma than taste."
"from mhewes in the Pre-Season Football BiF...enjoyed with some buffalo yam curry"
"This is strictly OK. Too bad. After trying the Smokestack Quad, which was fantastic, I had high hopes for this brew. Oh well. Plenty of great IPAs out there."
"D - I had forgotten how much I enjoy IPAs. This would be even better on tap. I so very much having my beer locked behind a cork. Still really great."
"D- Very drinkable, and very tasty."
"D- At 8.5% you can't exactly have a few of these, however it is a very drinkable IPA. Very balanced with the malts and hops."
"The drink is medium-bodied and crisp with impressive carbonation and superb drinkability. Many thanks to Dr. Brad for the bottle (This one tried in vain to escape the trade package, punching through the styro, but not quite making it through the cardboard... A worthy adversary who went down fighting. RIP.)!"
"As IPA's go, one of the best. Pours hazy orange-copper with a thick, frothy off-white head. Sweet, fruity aroma with grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and pine. Taste is as big as an Imperial without the heavy mouthfeel. Lots of citrus-with-caramel flavors. The apricot and blood orange do show through as advertised. Melon and spice do come out as the beer warms. Big hop flavor without being a hop bomb. Loved it."
"3.4/5"
"Not my favorite IPA, but would drink it again."
"Medium body, with a higher amount of carbonation. Bottle conditioned. Overall, pretty tasty. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Thanks to ballewblake for the opportunity to try this. 750 ml bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. Poured a translucent amber with a four inch frothy, off-white head that crackled and popped as it slowly diminished; some sticky strands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose was piney hops with a hint of sweetness towards the back. More piney hops in the mouth, as well as sweet malt and some alcohol. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a consistent carbonation tingle across the tongue, followed by some hops bitterness at the finish. All and all, a well-balanced DIPA, however; my preference leans more towards the sweet side of the style."
"Very good balanced brew."
"Perhaps this is too even-tempered, but from my perspective, this should gain the notoriety reserved for the best in it's class."
"D: I'm loving this brew. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good IPA. I'll be keeping a couple of bottles around as soon as I get back up to the liquor store."
"Drinkability - This is deff. not a session drink. But I'm glad I got 2 bottles."
"I've long enjoyed Boulevard products, but this is my first from the Smokestack series. Very nice."
"D: very nice DIPA, very well balanced. highly recommended and will drink again."
"Thanks to pepsican for the bottle. Pours a deep amber/brown color with a large head. Aroma is fruit, pine, styrofoam with an overall sweetness. Flavor is good with a slight bitter finish but not overdone. Has hints of pine with a refreshing flavor that has a definite citrus undertone."
"Drinkability is low here but given the right circumstances I could probably sip a few from a keg if I didn't have to drive anywhere."
"Bottle shared via piscator. Pours a murky tangerine with huge head, three four fingers easy. Nose- very rich smelling, caramel just a little hop citrus. Taste- thick and chewy, big caramel sweetness. Hops are muted by the malt, not much of a piney or citrus feel to it. More spicy than bitter really. Low to medium carbonation and heavy bodied."
"this is a great dipa that i would drink on the regular if i could get it."
"Notes: Bill, thanks for sending me this. I'll keep my eyes peeled for more beers from this series!"
"Almost tart, definitely dry in the finish, this is a unique American DIPA that incorporates elements of the Belgian twist on the IPA style - it reminds me of a good Belgian IPA, hopped up on another huge dosage of Humulus Lupulus."
"The bottle was corked and caged with the liquid poured into my best Schlitz glass. The color was a nice dark almost caramel color. Smell is good for an IPA, nice and hoppy. Taste is good but might be a little strong in alcohol in the end. Overall good, I live in Iowa and glad to change it up when I can."
"Another one of the smokestack series from boulevard, i've been awfully impressed with the other ones i've tried, figured this would be no different. it looks nice, has a nice reddish brown color to it with a nice head, which laces quite well. smell is awesome, has a great hop aroma, very piney overall. taste is really good, not as powerful as some of the more mainstream ipas, maharaja, lagunitas, DFH etc, but still has a great flavor to it. boulevard should be very proud of these beers."
"Another top brew from their Smokestack Series, a pleasure to consume."
"This one is an easy drinker. Fantastic beer. Wish I could get more of this."
"D: Very drinkable even with high ABV. This has moved towards to the top of my list for favorite IPAs."
"Taste is grapefruit all over with hops and some malt undertones. This beer is a little sweet. Mouthfeel is very bubbly and alcohol is well hidden. This beer is quite balanced. Not as over the top as some other IPA's I have had."
"this is a beer that i have been lucky to get my hands on and a beer that i will be in surch of in the neer future, get one if you can"
"D - a good tasting sipper."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange color, very nice carbonation, awesome two-finger plus creamy/foamy off-white head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, hoppy, nice touch of citrus and pines. The taste is malty, hoppy, bitter, nice notes of citrus and some pine. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty/nice IPA, thanks Tim and James."
"D: As expected, solid."
"D - I could drink this a lot. The hops don't seem to overpower you and it has great balance."
"Pours a glowing reddish copper with a tall tan head of tightly packed bubbles,nice retention and big sheets of 3-D stickiness. The nose is lightly malted and is mostly fruity with lots of banana and grapefruit. This is a hop monster,but a gentle giant as well. Very smooth for a double and highly drinkable,I can't get enough! Tastes are in line with the nose,sweet and slightly bitter with lots of pine sap flavors,as well as orange and other citrusy fruits. The body is medium to full and has a nice sugary mouth coating factor that keeps things interesting long after the last drop is swallowed. The Smoke Stack collection has been very impressive and Double-Wide IPA is no exception."
"D - An outstandingly drinkable beer! Complex enough to hold my interest, but subtle enough to refrain from taxing the tastebuds. This probably qualifies as a hop bomb, but not to the extent of some tongue searing DIPAs and powerful IPAs. Damn fine beer. Kudos to Boulevard for making some really outstanding brew."
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"This one explodes out of the bottle with a hazy orange amber color with a hint of red. the head is massive and lingers as a cap forever leaving tons of lacing. The aroma is very balanced with big citrus hops smells up front with grapefruit and apricots. But the sweet caramel malt base comes through as well as a slight honey sweetness. The taste has a bit of hops up front with grapefruit, but nothing overpowering, followed by the bready malts and fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and a slight bitterness in the finish. This is my first in the Smokestack series and I'm extremely impressed. This is a great IPA."
"Pours a gorgeous bronzeish,orange color with a nice off white frothy, pillow like head that really hangs out for a while. Smell is Hop glorious! Very subtle aromas of orange peel,grapefruit with a pleasant bready aroma. Taste is superb! citrus fruit extravaganza with a nice tangy hop bitterness. Malt is by no means overpowering but is matched well with the extreme hop profile. Mouthfeel is also superb leaving a nice creamy bitterness with a touch of alcohol at the end. Drinkibility seems to be ok for a DIPA with a 8.5%ABV. Overall a fantatic beer, and well worth seeking out, if you haven't tried it. Highly Recommended!"
"Good chewy mouthfeel, lots of resin and loads of malt. A tasty mouthwaterer with bright citrus, pine, and grapefruit abound."
"After seeing how dark it poured I was expecting a DIPA that was a little too sweet and a little too balanced for my liking, but this one is great."
"A good IPA but not a great one. For me I like to taste my hops as well as feel them. This one ends up being way to harsh for my liking and because it was $8.99 for just one bottle it gets lumped in my no column. Too expensive for a mediocre unbalanced brew."
"Pours aa beautiful dark orange/amber with a huge bready looking head that leaves some fantastic lacing and sticks around. Super piney aromas- almost medicinal in their intensity, like a nice gin. Sweet malt and some breadiness rounds it out. The taste is very nice as well, but it drops off a bit after an initial spicy, hoppy breadiness. There is a slight medicinal taste and some sweet breadiness at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than it could be, and it is just a tad grainy as well. Still, this is quite an enjoyable beer. Very nice."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good flavorful beer with some strength that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Little bit of yeast on the bottom of the bottle."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 3/4""" beige head above the clear orangey amber brew. Head shrinks gradually, with sporadic lacing. Aroma is citrus and pin hops character, with alcohol apparent. Taste starts moderately sweet, with ample fresh piney hops taking over quickly, and then a warming close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good as well. Nice brew, maybe not hoppy enough for some, but this will do just fine."
"pours a murky amber color with a frothy ivory head. great lacing! the nose is a big IPA aroma! lots of citrus hops. probably my favorite character of this beer. the taste is the same. citrus hops but not as appealing as the smell. the body is a little too weak for me but it is still a good beer."
"Recommended tasting if you have not had this one yet, but quite possibly the weakest of the Smokestack Series, which, of course, is definately not a bad thing."
"Just a bit too much... a small tweak in the recipe could have yielded a 4.5 instead of a 3.5 for taste. Disappointing after their very excellent Saison and Tripel."
"HV"
"Incredibly enjoyable and very drinkable. I wish I had another one in the fridge right now."
"D-Its smooth and easy enough to drink but still not something i would drink all the time"
"Poured from the 750 to a tulip. Huge overflowing head on a copper body. Smells of some caramel or sugary malt. Not a lot of hop aroma. Taste is similar. Some good malt sweetness, but not much of a bite forma ny hop bitterness. Would love some citrus or pine, but not geting much. Fizzy mouthfeel but not a bad beer to session, it seems, despite the big abv."
"Poured from a 750ml champagne bottle into a tulip glass. As I poured a little faster than normal, a huge head formed and I had to wait a few minutes for it to recede so I could pour a little more into the glass. The foam stuck around for quite a while and left behind some very nice lacing. Hazy amber in appearance. Very lovely to look at! Smell is of big-time piney hops. Not like other DIPAs out there, as this one is not so much on the citrus end of things. Some hints of caramel hit the nose, but it's hard to find amongst the huge hop aroma. Taste is much the same. It's all hops on this one, baby! Piney, a bit of citrus, grapefruit, a bit floral, good use of caramel malt, dry yeasty finish. Also, I strangely picked up a hint of coffee on the finish?? Hmmm... This thing was supercarbonated which made for plenty of enjoyable belches, yet it was somewhat syrupy and full-bodied. Alcohol could be felt, and gave a slight warming effect as the brew warmed up to room temperature. A very nice DIPA, and was very happy to find some of the Smokestack Series while in the Cities over the weekend."
"D- a good beer, will definitely finish the 750 in one session, but couldnt open another"
"Decent enough, but not worth the ten-spot for the bomber."
"D: Nice IPA but I've had better, more flavorful and balanced offerings. Alcohol is well masked though and this is still a great beer. Would drink again."
"This brewery is hammering some dingers. This is a very good (1.5X) IPA. As in a top ten. Creamy with grapefruit. There is more hop taste, balanced terrifically than bitterness. Would have again in a minute.Ahtanum, Centennial and Chinook hops, and the taste was not in my face."
"D- This is a great big IPA with some nice complex malt sweetness to support the depth of the hops. It was a bit much to finish a 750ml bottle myself as I started to get tongue fatigue after a bit. But it was well worth it."
"Pours a cloudy light brown/orange, thin white head forms, drops to a thin ring and layer, leaves behind a metric ass ton of lace, looks good. Smell is caramel and honey, some grapefruit, oranges, lemons, tart pineapple, real neat. Taste is good as well, sherry alcohol hit, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, light pine, strawberries, sugary with a spicy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and balanced. Thanks Russ!"
"Pours a hazy orange/brown with a MASSIVE light tan head. The carbonation levels must have been super high from the bottle conditioning, as my glass was mostly foam. Smell is very earthy, chalky, and slightly metallic. Taste is very mild for an IPA, toasted malt, a biscuity flavor, with a light piney hop flavor. There is a hint of grapefruit as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, carbonation levels are low. Quite smooth and drinkable, I could drink the entire 750ml easily. It doesnt quite taste as bitter as most IPA's, but it is quite flavorful and an excellent beer to have."
"D: Fairly good, and rather drinkable."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is a touch high, but mostly held in check by the hops and solid malt base. i think this one could sneak up with you and do some damage if you weren't paying attention. good stuff"
"Delicious. Someone send me more ASAP. This is the first Boulevard beer I've ever had. Can't wait to try to more from the Smokestack series."
"Bottle courtesy of the ever generous Hogtownharry: Poured a clear copper color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma consists of dominant citrus and floral hops with a distinctive touch of grapefruit all of which constitute a near perfect aroma. Taste is a mix between some citrus and grapefruit hops with a light floral malt backbone. Bitterness is not a dominant element and I somewhat enjoy the fact that a IIPA can be something else that a bitter bomb. Average body with good carbonation and no discernable alcohol. I really enjoyed the presence of grapefruit notes and the attenuation of the bitterness. This beer really makes me want to further discover the beer form this fine brewery."
"Pours a dark copper color, with an incredibly dense, foamy tan head, really good lacing on the glass. Smell is raw, piney hops. A ton of pine aroma in the nose, almost completely dominates the smell. Taste delivers on the pine, with a decent amount of sweet/caramel malt taste to equal things out, a touch of grapefruit bitterness in there, too. There's a bit of a raggedness to the edges of this beer, kind of rough on the palate...some nice spiciness on the tongue, though. Really glad for the opportunity to try this one...all the hopheads should definitely check it out."
"D - Stands up as a easy to drink IPA. A nice dry hop would really make this one stand tall. Other than that nit pick, it's worthy of a try."
"This is an excellent IPA that will definitely give your tongue a beating which just happens to be a quality I love in my IPAs. My first of the Smokestack Series and if the others live up to Double Wide I'm certainly in for a treat. Thanks again Jeremiah!"
"Boulevard did well enough with this one I think."
"Murky looking copper-orange. Thick and fluffy white head. Lace is quite full. The aroma leans way too heavy on the citrus and pine traits. Not that those are necessarily bad, but this is more like smelling pine-sol. Some grassy notes as well on the nose. The flavor doesn't pick up the slack for the nose. Very average as well. Too grassy. Too piney. And a little too harsh for my liking. There's a lingering harshness that is not like your typical lingering bitterness in well crafted DIPA. This is more astringent than bitter. More solvent like than resiny or pungent. I've had lots better. This is merely average."
"This beer is just too much alcohol heat for me to enjoy. Drop the ABV a couple of percentage points and it would be one of the more nicely balanced American IPAs. I wish I had someone to split this bottle with because one glass is enough for me."
"I would definitely buy this one again.. Its delicious.."
"The first time I had this beer I used a snifter, this time I used an imperial pint glass. It pours with a thick head with moderate retention that leaves some lacing. It is almost the color of tea. It doesn't have a strong nose, but what is present has hints of citrus and grain. For as thick as the head is, there isn't much carbonation on the tongue. There is lots of hop bitterness that stays in the mouth well after a taking a drink. It has just a hint of sweetness at the finish. This is a very drinkable beer."
"I've been slowly finding my inner hophead over the past year, and now it's coming out full on with a vengence. A seriously anticipated brew from some regional favorites that should give me my fix. Pours a flat copper with a ton of fluffy, rolling tan head off a very light pour. The head recedes at a snails pace and leaves a chunky lacing here and there. Smells of sweet citruses and sugary grapefruit with a fruity sourness as an afterthough and a striking hoppiness enveloping it all very nicely. Taste is uniquely thick and sweet up front with the bitterness and citrusy goodness following things up quickly, making for a different, yet very substantial and palate pleasing experience. Some chalkiness lingers around afterwards. This brew is big on the carbonation, has a medium mouth presence, and goes down fairly smooth. A bit weighty for my tastes, but I really can't complain beyond that."
"D: A drinkable American IPA, it just didn't have the delightfully bitter aftertaste that I want from a good American IPA. But overall, it did a good job of giving the soothing yet explosive taste I expect out of this style."
"D - This is a nice example of an imperial (double) IPA. We picked this up on a trip to KC and it's kind of a bummer I didn't pick up a few more. Boulevard does a decent job for a regional brewery and this 'special' edition is very well done."
"Pours copper in color, red hues and gets lighter the more you drink...how surprising. A massive off-white head, tight bubbles of carbonation and superb staying power. Spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is pretty good. Some pine and grapefruit with a spicy presence. Flowers, fresh grass, pretty earthy. Light sweetness. Taste is spicy up front. Pine and grapefruit rind to follow. Quite the earthy taste. The pine is almost like pine needles straight from a tree. A hint of caramel sweetness but a bitter, drying finish with some biscuity, breadiness to it. Mouthfeel has a good bitterness level. It isn't thick at all and very effortless and smooth. Great persistent carbonation and tingle with dryness on the tongue. Lots of assertive bitterness and very unique flavors. Almost too easy going down. A big old 750ml bottles of this seems just about right but if offered another glass, I might succomb to the pressure."
"Taste features a nice toasted malt and a nice citrusy hop presence. There is a bit of spiciness in there also. Alcohol is definitely noticeable though it isnt over powering. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and creamy. Pretty easy to drink despite the high ABV. Pretty good IPA that hinges on the double side of the ipa spectrum. I've had beers claiming to be doubles or imperials that were less."
"To me, the bitterness is a bit of a distraction and covers some of the other notes. Worthy of a try."
"Drinkablity- I cant wait to get my hands on this beer again, it seemed like it went by way too quick...Highly recommended!!"
"Overall a very good double but falls a notch below the leaders in the doulbe catagor. Still overall a very solid beer. Oh by the way, I love the corked and caged bottle."
"Pours a great caramel color with a hint of orange in light. Big 3 finger head stayed at 3cm. Good carbonation. Nose was lacking in the hops,overall light nose, a small amount of spices and fruits gave trhough. Big honey flavor, could have been better balanced with some bitterness. Overall very drinkable and not bad at all."
"In all this is a fantastic beer. For me IPA's are a summer time beer... For those that know Boise it gets HOT! Here. This is a beer I would love to cool off with."
"The alcohol catches the consumer in the end. Yet this is really good, a de facto DIPA well worth acquiring and enjoying. Well done."
"Another huge thanks goes out to Jimi.. top notch trader and doesn't flinch at sending huge boxes my way. Thanks and let's do it again soon."
"Pours an absolutely brilliant amber color with a huge, lasting cream colored meringue like, stiff head atop in a tulip glass. Smell is mildly fruity and floral hops through the thick head, but a light nose overall. Perhaps some peaches. Crisp mouthfeel, along with a strong, refreshing hop character. Drying, bitter and nicely fruity all at the same time, with peaches, mango, apricot and some grapefruit rind coming to mind. Wow, this is unique, flavorful, and very fruity without being syrupy or cloying in the least. Crisp bubbly mouthfeel, but slightly thick body too. This is perhaps my favorite DIPA. Awesome beer!"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Drinkability: Can we still be friends if I tell you I thought it was just okay?"
" Medium bodied, almost creamy, and almost too easy to drink.Although there is a significant hop presence, it is not overpowering and the balance is great. I had this with prime rib with some reservations, but found it went very well and added to the enjoyment. This seems to be somewhere between a standard American IPA and a Double IPA, but would rank very well in either category. Definitely worth a try."
"The"
"I paired this with a mushroom and homemade Italian sausage pizza on a focaccia bread crust. It was perfect, the bitter hops cut through the fats of the sausage and cheese while the malt enhanced the bready crust"
"Memo to Boulevard -- this is beer is a champ. I don't know what the plans are to add this to the permanent rotation, but it has my full endorsement."
"D: Tasty IPA that I'm glad I got the chance to try. Solid but nothing really pops out and the body is a bit weak for me."
"It's mild enough to enjoy a bottle to yourself, although this one was shared with friends."
"D - This is a very nice attempt at an IPA by the folks at Boulevard. And """It's twister proof!""""
"Wow, considering I usually drink the West Coast IPAs, this beer impressed me. It was nicely balanced, not over hoppy (at least for me), and it had a beautiful taste that went down silky creamy smooth. I need to get a second bottle....this is good shit."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden and the hops force me to continually go for another sip."
"Yeah, well - color me impressed. This beer is for hop lovers. The color is a nice reddish amber, but is cloudy. Many would count off for this, but I like cloudy beers. It means that they have not been filter heavily, which removes mush of the body and flavors in a finished beer. The head is EXCELLENT on this beer and sticks around forever. I would have posted my own picture of this beer for you - but I didn't think that you would want to see a fat guy humping a beer!"
"Boulevard Double Wide IPA pours a brownish orange with a nice stiff short head. The smell is huge of hops as is the taste. There is a touch of bitterness, but overall the tonnage of great hops makes up for it. Mouthfeel is medium thick and creamy, with a lot of bubbles. Started drinking this one at the start of Super Bowl XLII. It lasted all of first half and at no point became disappointing. Over time it mellowed just a touch. Overall the drinkability was fantastic and wowed me as one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"Drinkability is high as the flavors are not overwhelming."
"I'm pleased with Double-Wide India Pale Ale, my first Smokestack Series beer (officially No. 2 in the series). Boulevard has done a good job here and is only a few recipe tweaks away from very good. And at only $6.99 per bottle, it's a steal. And it's 'twister proof'."
"An outstanding IPA from Boulevard. Very glad to see them move in this direction."
"I do want to say that this beer was a sample 12oz bottle that I got from a Boulevard rep. This is not the production 22oz corked bottle that is available, there is a chance that the beer that I reviewed may not be the same one being produced."
"D-This would be a great session beer with the lighter body.I would like to see this in the regular line up from Boulevard,in 6 or 12 pks."
"This might just help push them toward the great level."
"Extremely impressive to look at and is a very drinkable beer. A good offering from Boulevard."
"Two comments: first, they've gotta work on the corks, way too hard to get off. Secondly, and I assume this will be fixed after some more practice, but of my 4 bottles only half the batch numbers were printed correctly, the other half were smeared beyond readability or were missing at least one digit."
"Did I say delicious, yet? I meant to..."
"Drank pretty easy for the abv. A solid, but not too inspired IPA. More brute force than art in IMO, but still tasty"
"Pours a a dark rusty orange with a fluffy slightly tan two finger head that seems to stick around forever. Stickiness is damn good, lots of thick webbing that grabs hold of the glass. Smell is big on the citrus with a hint of pine. Slick oily hops tickle the nose as well with a tiny bit of caramel and earthiness underneath. Overall the aroma of this one is enjoyable, but very light. Grapefruit flavors up front with some caramel malt as well. Subtle pine and dirty hop flavors midway through. Alcohol is present a tad in the aftertaste with more of the fresh evergreen tingle. Taste is a bit here and there, but still decent. Very nice fluffy medium body with a mild carbonation. One of the best feeling brews in the IPA/DIPA category. I can't thank bort11 enough for this one, I love trying new beers and look forward to the other three beers in the Smokestack Series that Boulevard has to offer."
"This IPA has more alcohol than any other I've had, without the alcohol being noticeable in the taste. That's a plus. I think that hops can only take you so far though, and I'd rather not think of pine trees while I enjoy a beer's aftertaste."
"From a 750ml, corked and caged, poured into a Chimay Chalice (I know, not the proper glassware). Poured a hazy amber with a nice 2 inch creamy head. Very little lacing. Aroma was of course hoppy, with a nice lemon citrus and just a bit of pine. Taste was very well balanced. Not overly hoppy and had a great malt backbone. I was very surprised. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a nice oily feel. Not being a hophead, I found this to be about the most drinkable IPA/DIPA Ive had. Super job Boulevard."
"Notes: It's a nice brew from Boulevard's Smokestack series. It's novelty in the wine bottle is a decent touch."
"D - Very high. Good IPA."
"there has been some discussion on the board as to which style this falls under. It kind of sits on the fence between an American IPA and a DIPA. Either way, this is delicious."
"A lighter version of an IPA, but Im in love with this one. Good thing that I have a few more in the basement."
"This beer has a nice balance of bitterness and malt. It is not a hit you over the head with hops brew. Very easy drinking for the alcohol level."
"Overall this is an excellent new IPA from Boulevard, It's not going to burn your tongue off - with only 55 IBUs, it's barely an IPA - but the taste and aroma off this beer both have enough complexity to keep you interested and the balance of the beer preserves your taste buds so you can enjoy the whole 750ml, although the 8.5% will sneak up on you."
