"Overall: Expected more bursting flavors coming from a beer with an 8.2% ABV.  However, it is very easy to drink and I would recommend it as a casual summer IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Much better than the Unearthly IPA which is 9.5% alcohol.    Still somewhat disapointed by this beer."
""
""
""
"I didn't care for this very much."
""
""
""
"Nice hop smell. Doesn't return on the taste. Lack of malt backbone here. Feels light and watered down. On tap at Dees."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Very nice IPA.  Nice body, not thin and commercial.  Nice flavor; just hoppy enough to be very enjoyable without having a overly dry finish.  Refreshing.  I would gladly drink this beer again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my ipa. Complete lack of fruit/citrus hints."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer, go get one!"
""
"D: For such a high alcohol beer and being a DIPA, I’d expect a lot stronger flavors. The hops and alcohol come on very soft. I do like this beer, though. At 8.2% and being this easy to drink this might be my new backyard beer."
"Solid all around, if not spectacular."
"A great beer overall. I have to admit that the aftertaste, or, rather, the """afterbreath""" is slightly unpleasant for some reason. After drinking most of  a six-pack, the taste on my breath isn't the most enjoyable, and is worse after waking up in the morning. This might be just me, however, and I won't let it effect my rating of this otherwise great beer. If you haven't tried 2XIPA yet, put it on the """to do""" list."
""
"o: Smooth and easy to drink. An absolute pleasure, actually."
""
"Had two of these the other night at a local restaurant in Crownsville, MD, Lures.  (They have a very nice selection of various beers on tap.)  Really nice showing from this DIPA.  Nice color, fresh taste and good finish that you’d expect from a very good quality IPA.  Still may prefer my favorites, but this was a good one.  Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
"For the high amount (my opinion) of alcohol in it is very good. Many other brews with 6% or more seem to have a bitey taste that lingers."
""
""
""
"Nice beer, was expecting more"
""
""
"Pine but nothing else. Basic hoppy IPA."
"To piney, too bitter, not enough here. Feels like they added a ton of hops to the boil and they lost everything you really want because of it. Not my favorite by S. Tier, the one that i give out from their 12 pack. Eh"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A darned good double IPA. Many times these stronger IPA's are hard to drink, this one is smooth and easy."
""
""
""
"This was a double IPA. This was not a bad double IPA. Very drinkable and would happily drink again, but also wasn't anything life changing."
""
"Outlier review here... underwhelming aroma, piney on the palate (as this review is whiney), no distinct hop character, overall unpolished compared to some fantastically brewed 2x IPAs on the market right now.  On the positive I thought this beer produced a wonderful pillow-like head."
""
""
"Gold, straw colored, not much head and mild hop, citrus smell. Taste was OK, not much going on? Not as good as DFH 90 minute, but easy drinking like a session IPA, 8.20 % ABV?  A good solid DIPA."
""
""
"Enjoyable 2x IPA.  Tastes like a draft pour but this is from bottle. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"True to its title, I would say this delivers about two times what the average similarly-priced IPA does."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hoppy and full- a standout in a standout style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's difficult to know where to begin. First had on draft a couple months ago at Primanti Brother's in Wheeling. Almost immediately became my favorite IPA. Beautiful golden color that is slightly hazy. Incredible harmony of flavors with nothing overwhelming the other. Grapefruit, lemon, lemongrass and floral notes all in there. Labeled as a 2X IPA however it's not heavy duty by any means. Very drinkable. Never pass this one by."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A local NY favorite of mine. This beer is underrated in my opinion. It's a double IPA for anyone who appreciates the taste of well balanced hops with an honest amount of alcohol. I very good choice for the IPA lover. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"best ipa ive had in some time , nice looking cloudy orange, with some sweet malt smell mixed with some dank resiny hops. tastes awesome, immediate lemon sweetness, followed by some grape fruit bitterness, and orange peel.  great swings between sweet and bitter flavors ,heading towards a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on nitro.  Not fond of the nitro making it a bit hot on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its fuckin delish and will knock u on ure ass the best of both worlds"
""
"Smooth and hoppy without a big bite."
"Disclaimer: I am a hophead and this is my session IPA. I will always want to try differ beers and differ styles but if this is on tap, hard for me to avoid. Today, wanted it,walked to a couple (local in walking distance) bars to get it on tap. : ).  I consider this a """1.5""" IPA. It's not quite a double but def not a single.  More of a crisp, clean IPA, no real malt, but nothing on the citrussy side, more of a lemony, organic taste. No real sweetness or floral flavor like a Racer 5 or 2 hearted,  just straight hops with a touch of slight fruit bite. Settles smoothly on the tongue and even after taste. I could drink these all night, although at my age and # of kids! that won't happen any time soon. LOL. Becoming a big fan of Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
"Very good imperial IPA, I love how it is not overly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid DIPA. Nothing amazing here."
"Very earthy flavors, you won't be disappointed"
""
"This is a solid and delightful beer that goes down like a lower abv brew. You could fool yourself into thiking this is a session ale until you fall on your face. Its hop forward construct and light malt body ecourage sip after dry and quenching sip. Nice beer."
"Probably would not seek out and purchase again. Only because it's hard to get near me and there are other DIPA'S that I prefer and are readily available. Still pretty tasty though."
""
""
""
""
"Strong citrusy hops aroma,  dry bitter hops up front with a smoothy slightly malty finish.  Good brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite beer. I saw another reviewer say this beer is cheap, I need to send him money to buy me beer because any Southern Tier 6 pack is 12.99 in DE. Underwhelmed by this beer, too one note for me."

"Nice and enjoyable, revisiting this one after a long hiatus. Sometimes you forget how solid some of the standard year round offerings are."
""
"Update. Not sure what happened but I really love this beer now."
"Very good IPA that can be bought anywhere, as a go to beer! As always DRINK FRESH!"
""
"Fairly average dbl. IPA,not in love nor do I hate it.It's okay but I would not buy it again. But, at the same price as Corona for 6 pack, maybe I will."

"Underwhelming in appearance, though nicely laced the glass. This is strong, a little malty, and just not to my tastes for hops - almost a skunky/off flavor."
""
"A very drinkable, balanced, and cheap IPA. This one goes down smooth. Almost too smooth for the abv. The finish lingers with a nice citrusy hope presence and leaves you wanting more. For only $35 a case this is an amazing beer."

"Decent beer, but the non 2x beers have better flavor profiles and finish much better. I thought this beer sacrificed flavor for more hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright gold with a thin head that trailed the glass. The smell was overloaded with hop scents of citrus and herb. The taste was a powerful punch of different hops that added grapefruit, lemon, as well as some pine flavors. I thought it was great and I think so would most hop heads. A clean finish made this one a great beer and I would highly recommend trying it if you haven't yet."

"2Xipa pours a nice big golden color with a big lacing head.  There is a very big and bold hoppy and malty aroma.  The taste is big, very malty, with big hop flavors coming through too.  Nice body and  flavors.  Overall its a bit too malty, and the hop flavor has a strange fit."

"Great affordable everyday drinking beer. Nice golden color and no bitter after-taste.  This is to date my favorite regular IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Light Citric Element Reminds Me Why I Like Double IPAs. Great Brewery Great Beers"
""
""
"It pours a dark hazy yellow with a smaller head. It has a light aroma of bitter citrus that you can really only smell when you put your nose to the glass. It is very bitter and hoppy. There are light floral and citrus flavors present."

"This is the IPA that I compair all other IPA's too. Pours a nice pale golden color with hints of red. Nice head and great lacing. Wonderful florral smells. Starts with a nice breaddy grain front end then burst with great floral and fruit flavors followed by a perfect bitter finish."

"Final Grade: 4.33, an excellent A grade. Southern Tier's 2XIPA is one of the best 'lighter' examples of this style I have ever had the pleasure of trying. While I could see the hop profile rubbing some people the wrong way (onion/garlic is not something you really expect in a beer), in my eyes it blends quite nicely with the other hop notes and slight alcohol flavour. A fabulous beer that I hope to return to eventually, since it is not available in my home market."
""
"Pours a hazy light copper body with a small white head with excellent retention. Laces the glass beautifully. Aromas are pleasantly floral and resinous with a distant whiff of pineapple. Just a had a KAPOW! This beer fires on all cylinders. So well rounded: initially sweet with caramel and a hint of cotton candy before a big orange peel and piney hops balance them out in the middle. A tangy pineapple and bitter orange zest linger long on the finish. Medium to full bodied, as befits a beer of such potency and strength of flavor. An outstanding double IPA."

"Solid, well balanced and not citrus-y. It does not seem to be a full imperial ipa though. It's not on the level with other imperials like dogfish head 90 min or Greenbush brother Benjamin. But it's $10 a six pack, not $12 for a four pack. Overall, 2XIPA is a good go to well hopped ipa."

"Cannot understand how this is a double IPA!  On what standard?!   It's more like an 8.2% lite beer than a double IPA. Where's the hops??  Light in color with a very light mouth feel.  Light frothy head.  Clarity indicates it's. Filtered IPA. THIS IS NOT GOOD. I'm stuck with a 5 gallon keg based upon a friends recommendation.  Great."

"If this beer were a glass of wine, it would be a White Zinfandel. It would be ordered by a girl in a leopard skin tight dress from New Jersey. Sorry to offend anyone but this is awful. I'm shocked it's getting high scores from so many people. Maybe since I have had a Real IPA, then this beer is very disappointing."
"This is a pretty delicious double IPA, delicious grapefruit hops, but has very little foam when poured, hence is a bit too light for my taste. However, it does have a crisp finish. One of my favorite beers, but it would be perfect if it was a little fuller."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty average. Thin head that quickly disappears. Slightly cloudy straw color. Very little fruit or hop presence. A little malt, a little grain, and a little bitter. Maybe a little clove? Really not much going on for a beer getting a 4+ rating on BA. I expected much more. Next please."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Of course the main man would like to get his 2x on fresh, but as for now it's a pass."
""
""
""
"O- I'm glad I picked this DIPA up, I'm blessed with a beverage store that rotates their growler taps and I'm trying to drink as many different beers as I can. This particular DIPA didn't launch past others I've tried but it held its own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Flavor: echoes the aroma. The citrus hops are powerful throughout the taste but there is some pleasant malt sweetness in the middle and finish."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not really an IPA kind of guy. I like some, but I've had a lot of highly regarded IPA's that I absolutely hated. I don't review them because I feel in order to review a beer, I need to get through a full glass. And some IPA's, I just can't. They taste like I'm drinking soap. But the 2XIPA isn't that way. It has a nice sweet blend to ease the bitter hops. It rivals DFH 90 minute. I would definitely drink more 2XIPA, and may go down as one of the great IPA's, as far as I'm concerned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pour a extremely light golden hue with solid effervescence and bubbling carbonation. The light color was worrisome that it would lack flavor. Strong aroma of pine and bitter floral hops. Taste was better than the appearance indicated, smooth with good carbonation. Tastes of caramel and malt with balanced hops. This was a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great gold and copper color. Good foam when poured. The smell of the hops and the malts are very distinct. Great. The taste is very hoppy at first with that long lasting aftertaste. Very bubbling which quickly dissipates, leaving that good bitter taste on the tongue. Overall is a great IPA. Will be buying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful golden/light amber pour with a nice frothy head. Smell is hoppy but not super strong. Taste confused me at first, being an imperial ipa I expected a strong spicy hop taste but it was a very smooth finish almost a malty presence. Southern tier never disappoints and every should give this beer a chance."
""
""
"By just looking at this beer poured in a glass it looks more like a light domestic than an DIPA and it definitely doesn't taste like a x2 either. The only real taste that stands out to me is the taste of alcohol... This brew leaves me searching for more depth in flavor and that's for sure where it's lacking. Glad I only have one 12oz. bottle and not a 6 pack to drink."
"O: Southern Tier 2XIPA is a very good beer in its own right, but with it being a DIPA, I can't ignore the fact that it tastes and feels more like an extremely good IPA. Like I said, not a bad brew and it will certainly appeal to any hophead, but if you're looking for an outstanding DIPA, look elsewhere. This one's merely just quite good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty light for a DIPA, but smooth, drinkable and balanced all the same. A beer that comes across better than the sum of its parts. Would be sessionable if not for the deceptively high ABV. A definite winner, IMO."

"Overall, this is a pretty good DIPA for only 9 bucks a 6er. Id buy it again. I wouldnt search it out though."
""
""
""
"Taste starts out with a strong piney front, quickly fades to the sweet malt backing which also quickly leaves and finishes with a semi-bitter finish, citrus and light fruit flavors linger about, carbonation is medium to medium-high with an appropriate body."

""
""
""
""

""
"OVERALL-"
"A: Very nice yellow/gold with an average head (about 1 cm). S: very floral maybe a hint of citrus but the hoppy scent just wasn't there for me. T: Quite bitter but not as bitter as I had hoped for when I picked up a """Double IPA""" but still great flavor. M: above average carbonation and it goes down easily. OA: I liked this beer a lot actually as an IPA, it had great bitterness and a high ABV. But not a 2xIPA I recommend it and I really enjoyed it."

""
""
""

""
"Overall: a great beer. I enjoyed every second of this 12 pack. The 8.2% ABV definitely packs a punch. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a hoppy IPA. Cheers and enjoy"

"Somewhat drinkable with a slightly bubbly mouth. Not my favorite IPA, but somewhere in the middle of the pack."
""
""
""
"I've had a lot of DIPA and this one is middle of the road. Very drinkable, as it warms it gets slightly better. It has a great piney taste, that is a attribute that I look for in all DIPA & IPA's. With a 8.2% ABV it doesn't have that strong taste as you would think for a higher alcohol content."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think it is still better than most."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear, orange-golden color with a thin, eggshell head settling atop the brew. Big simcoe hop aromas burst from the glass. Grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit aromatics join slight pine resin notes and a touch toasted bread. Caramel and lightly toasted malt flavors are quickly subdued by big flavors of tropical fruit, grapefruit, lemon zest, and a touch of pepper. Very well balanced, this beer is medium-light in body with a slightly lower than expected amount of carbonation. Extremely drinkable, this beer seems to come off more as a double Pale Ale than a double Indian Pale Ale."

"Overall: If you like big IPAs, I feel like you've had this. If you haven't, seek it. Maybe not a beer for the casual drinker, but a must-have for IPA fans. Also a good companion for a good meal. I had this with BBQ tempeh, French fries and Brussels sprouts and it fit the bill."

"I am not sure this is really a Double IPA. The alcohol content suggests that it is but it does't have the full body of most DIPAs. It is very hoppy of course, but as it warms I taste a grassy flavor and pine. It finishes with carmel malty hues. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce into pint glass. WOW!!! My new favorite IPA. Big, bold, fruity, hoppy, balanced, amazing. Like a gesyer of deliciousness exploding on my palette. Mouthfeel increases the flavor as you swallow (thats what she said). Drink this beer with passion and joy because thats what Southern Tier put into this Double IPA. Cheers!"

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with short lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrusy and piney hops, biscuit malt and oranges. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy, piney hops dominate the flavor with pale malt and ripe fruit provide support. Finish is long and bitter. Very nice brew. Goes down easily despite high alcohol."
""
""
"BOD 12/19/13. Golden pour with a very nice head and lacing that lasts. Nice nose of citrus hops (grapefruit, orange and tangerine) against a slightly sweet background. Medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Well carbonated so that it supports the body. The flavor profile is a well balanced blend of hop flavor, bitterness and malt sweetness. It starts with some grapefruit and pine, then the bitterness and finishes slightly sweet. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. The finish is between crisp and smooth with a lingering bitterness and tartness. An outstanding IPA, but not quite as good as Founder's Harvest, NoDa Hop Drop or Lagunita Sucks. It is, however, more complex than they."
"A truly exceptional double IPA, if not the best then its up there. Anyone who is even moderately a fan of stronger IPAs and strong American ales owes it to themselves to try this. Probably my favorite in this family of ales ever."

"Full Disclosure - I've had only 3 DIPAs, but if fully 66.6% had that special malty something, and one does not, I'm going to assume that it's missing that special flavorful something which counts for quite a bit. Further disclosure: the only other Southern Tier beer I've had is Pumpking, so maybe my expectations were a tad high."

"8.20% and who would have guessed? This beer is not bold. It is not ambitious. It is, however, among the most drinkable dIPAs I have encountered. Very light mouthfeel, bitter but not overwhelming. The greatest achievement of this beer is, in my mind, it's ability to hide it's alcohol content. It tastes good...it drinks easy..and that's where this brew excels. I wouldn't list this among my favorite IPAs, or even among my favorite beers. But if you are looking for a mild bark with a bite that'll set you straight, look no further."

"Bittering hops prevail, a bit much for my tastes. Malt is only a support. The flavoring hops could be more complex, and I'd like more malt backbone for a dipa."

"I am a big fan of IPAs. This one has a fantastic bouquet (better than most) and a nice taste without too much of a bite. Don't be fooled though, you are drinking a fully flavored beer. Frankly, this could be a beer you enjoy in the North Carolina beach heat (not a bunch but a few). The alcohol taste is there but Minimal. The finish is there and lasts as I expect and enjoy in an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Extreme balance with this brew and the tastes go well together.  Not packed with a whole lot of flavor though.  Mouthfeel is the best part of this as its light and dry but not necessarily what a DIPA is supposed to be.  regardless, its a nice beer no matter what style it belongs in."

"Clear pale gold body, good showing of lacing. Dose of cedar in the aroma, zesty citrus as well with a bit of spices. More citrus than cedar in flavor though the latter does lurk around in there. Bit soapy which rubs off on texture. Good bitterness upfront, very creamy in the finish. I like it, not top tier but solid nonetheless."

"This is a surprisingly good double IPA. It is not as big as a DIPA as I would have expected, but it is a really nicely balanced beer. Good citrus hop aroma with a malt backbone to give it a nice taste with a good mouthfeel. I would not call this a session beer but it sure was easy to drink. I could definitely enjoy a few of these."

"smells of soapy hops in aroma but that doesn't come out in flavor thankfully, golden clear in color with a little bit of a copperish tinge. kind of an odd but somewhat balanced flavor, this ipa doesn't really do much for me. not overly hoppy but some bitterness. booziness pretty well masked though, otherwise meh."

"Comes to the table a slightly hazy light golden color with a smallish off white head that persists. Smells of hops, yeah no shit right? Pine and citrus with a bit of grapefruit and resin, light bready caramel malt provides a hint of balance. The flavor is fruity hops with lots of citrus and pine and a bit of caramel to round it all out. Solid but smooth hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice smooth flavorful IPA, I really enjoyed this."

"I had this beer after my brother, who is my go to beer expert, recommended Southern Tier's IPA. The bar I went to only had the 2x, so I gave it a try. It was absolutely delicious. Satisfied my craving for a crisp, cool, refreshing IPA. Didn't leave that filmy bitter taste some IPAs can leave behind. Delicious, not overly hoppy."
""
""
""
"O: I love IPA's and this is great, maybe lighter and not as potent as most DIPA's but good none the less. It's an DIPA that you are able to have more than one glass, and would definitely want more than one glass, enjoy."
""
""
"O: 2xIPA is mild in terms of bitterness, and it packs a lot of pleasant tropical hop flavors. A rather tame and easygoing DIPA. Good, but no real wow factor."

""
""
""
"O - This is not a game-changing DIPA, but it's very, very good. It's on par with single IPAs like Flower Power and Jai Alai; in other words, it's a drinkable, every day IPA. I expect a little more from DIPAs, but this is still a very good brew."

"Date tasted: July 25, 2013 ... Glassware: La Fin du Monde snifter... Occasion: enjoying an evening of Strat, music and good beer....Appearance: slightly hazy, lightly golden body with cascading effervescence; head is snow white, snow deep and beautifully laced; quite an attractive ale out the box... Aroma: the bottle boasts four separate hops varieties--and the nostril is bombarded by harsh pine cone and soft department store perfume counter, almost lilac and lavender; secondary citrus and grapefruit sneak in... Palate: as expected, a full-bodied, full-on attack at the teeth with a bit of warmth at the end; second and third sips ease the intensity, but the warmth remains...Taste: as promised, a near-mad balance of hops and malts, with the bitterness being more palpable yet not as put-offish as some maltreated double IPAs...Overall: After a rabid camp discussion on the virtues of the double IPA, I made this part of a build-a-six and am not disappointed with the selection...not mentioned among the thirty or so we pleasantly recalled, this beer gets the taste buds titillated while bringing enough disguised alcohol to only need a few for the weeknight...recommended and part of the double IPA discussion for doing much well..."

Its right in line with Two-Hearted and Centennial but is one that I like just a bit more...Although Two-Hearted will always have a place in my heart. If you see this it is definitely worth a try. You may just find a new favorite."

"Taste starts with a ton of pine and some resin, followed by grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Has a piney, grapefruit, lemon, bready, slighty floral, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is definitely on the light side for a DIPA, with above average carbonation. Normally I would want a heavier body for a DIPA, but this lighter body helps keep the intense piney-ness from being overwhelming, also making it a surprising refreshing 8.2% beer."

"Southern Tier's 2XIPA pours golden in color with little head and not much lacing. The smell is pleasing, the taste is fantastic and the mouthfeel is subtle but good. I enjoyed this beer, but it was pricey. I'd have again, but only at a more reasonable price. From what I understand this is offered at $10 a sixer, but I haven't found it yet."

"Pours vivid gold with sparkling clarity and an inch of foam that fell to some downright chunky lacing. Not a big nose on this beer. Light citrus, faint grass and pale malt. Taste is crisp and so easy to drink. The hops come forward nicely with touches of lemon and grapefruit. The pale malt stands up just sweet, sturdy and strong. Hops and malt both sweeten up as the beer warms. Finishes with a long bitter aftertaste, and a dry malt presence that makes this a dapper DIPA."

"O: DIPAs in an $11 6-pack are few and far between, and I can't think of another as quality as 2XIPA. Among the better bargain beers around, and along with Live, an expected staple this summer."
""
"B-"
""
""
"Overall- This is a go to DIPA for me, This bottle is a little old and I have had this 1 week old and its awsome. Still very good now, an east coast DIPA for sure, and considering its price and availability its a great deal. There are way better doubles out there but as an affordable standard this is a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours golden with stunning clarity, and has a frothy, white head that holds good retention. Both citric and caramely malt on the nose with some tropical notes to boot. Nice meld of juicy tropical hops, citric grapefruit, pine, bready malt, caramel, and honey on the palate. Mouth-feel is medium-full with nice carbonation. Overall, a solid DIPA."
""
"O: Definitely a winner. While you can't judge a book by its cover, it's too bad that the appearance is so unremarkable, especially when the imbibation process is ultimately so righteous! All in all, Southern Tier's got the right idea with their take on the American DIPA. My advice: Skip their underwhelming standard IPA and go straight for the 2X!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"TRY THIS BEER."
"It is so refreshing to see a DIPA that brings forth any nuances from the grains and malts like this one does! The hops are without a doubt a bit more subtle than I expected them to be, but their presence makes itself known throughout, with the solid grain backbone soon following. It's not necessarily the most complex DIPA on the block, but it's undeniably easy going and perfect for even the most casual settings. Not my favorite in the style, but definitely one that I can commend for its original recipe that breaks the mold for once."

"BTW, if you pick up this beer, let it warm a bit. It is much more balanced and I find the malt asserting itself a bit more as the beer warms. I left it out of the fridge 30 minutes before I poured and it wouldn't have hurt to have left it out 10-15 more. Either it's getting better as it warms or I'm feeling the alcohol. :-)"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is great if you are looking for over the top pine and hop. I guess if you are reaching for a 2xIPA that is what you are looking for. I just thought the type of bitter was a bit too sharp, not quite the aggressiveness I would be looking for. The odd nose put me off, but I was able to drink through that."
""
"Overall - Strange beast, not a 2IPA or even close imho. Really lightweight, moderately hoppy, morwe like a Pale Ale than anything. Need a lot more than this for the ABV."

"The un-icing on the cake is the fact that Firestone's Pale 31 (opened for comparison) was not only tastier but hoppier. StArnoldFan (another TX BA who review this bottling) offers a second, equally unfavorable opinion. Southern Tier, please advise."

"Well I have to start out by saying I was really excited to hear Southern Tier would be making its way to Texas. It's here, and 2x was my 1st 6 pack to pick up. I'll start out by saying I'm very disappointed. It pours a piss yellow with a finger of white head. Much more yellow than to be expected from a DIPA. It smells heavy of corn, not sure what is going on there?? The taste is alright but I've had so many DIPA's that put this to shame. This is my 1st offering from a new brewery that Texas now has distro to, and I hope there is better to follow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a hazy almost amber color with a medium head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice amount of splotchy lacing. The bread and malts hit your nose up front and then the hops come through nicely after. It is not quite as hoppy as I expected since it is a IIPA but still damn good. A medium amount of carbonation with this guy. Overall, I really enjoyed this brew. If I could get it near me I would definitely pick up more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours golden with a minimal white head and lots of visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. There's a light aroma of hops. There's citrus and pine with some bready malt in the background. The taste absolutely follows the nose. The citrus and piney hops are forward with some sweetness and breadiness from the malt. It's very straightforward. The alcohol is also there in the flavor. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and a bit sweet on the finish. This is a very good beer."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed by this brew. The hops are just way too weak and this was only a couple months past the bottling date. Boost the hop flavor and this beer would be worlds better."
""
""
"Absolutely nothing wrong with this beer - if you are after a great Belgian Ale."
""
""
"O: Was bottled on 3/7/13 so pretty fresh. I'll be honest, I don't like this nearly as much as their regular IPA. I would pick up the IPA over the 2XIPA if they were next to each other. I'd also note that this would probably be best not as your first beer of the night but maybe your 2nd or 3rd."
""
""
""
""
"Both the smell and the taste are refreshing. It is quite carbonated. The hops are not overly bitter, but provide a carbonated, grapefruit experience. This is a very good IPA, but really a lot less hoppy/bitter than most double IPAs. It's more of a good American IPA than a double. I would probably get this again for a hot, summer day...or to introduce someone to American IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden with persistent white head. Dank hoppy smells of spicy onion and pine resin. The flavor follows through pretty much the same with dank hops taking the leading role and the pale malt just supporting. Somewhat refreshing and drinkable when cold, but like drinking sticky hop resin as it warms. Pretty good either way."
""
""
""
""

"This beer pours up a clear medium gold with a one and one half finger head, not much retention, but a moderate amount of lacing. The smell is floral and citrus, sort of understated, but there nonetheless. Taste is where this really shines. It has that nice massive grapefruit flavor followed by a satisfying bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice with a decent amount of carbonation. Alas I only had one bottle of this. I'd drink more if I had them."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"So far my pick for a double IPA, Piney, and delicious. The smell is wonderful and the taste does not disappoint. This will stay with you long after that sip is gone. Great take on a great style. I would say yes to this one always, also amazing if you can find on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - classified as not quite a DIPA but bigger than an ipa. Hmm.. When I think of 'American ipa, DIPA' I think of something flowing with hops. This is more of an English double ipa if anything. Still very good, but lately with a few certain APA's I've reviewed it has nowhere near the hop profiles those particular pales had. I was a bit disappointed at first due to the lack of gushing hops, but quickly reminded myself that a beer doesn't have to be overdone with hops to be top shelf, so why does every ipa have to be hopped up? The fact is, this isn't your traditional American double ipa, but just a dang good blue collar beer thats well crafted and has its bright spots. I'll have this again one day for certain."
"This is another great example of the difference between bottled beer and what you get on tap. In bottles, it's a decent DIPA, but nothing special. On tap, this is a a great summer-time ale. Very light in color, very refreshing, but nicely hoppy and very delicious. Also easy to get in the northeast and affordable. If you weren't impressed in the bottle, give it a try on tap!"

"It pours a yellow amber great clarity and good carbonation with medium retention. It has average to above average clarity. It has an amazing aroma of sweet malts with citrus and pine hops on the back end. The taste is amazing balanced especially considering the alcohol content. The big malts are welcome and then the hops come in and perfectly balance this beer. Considering tht this was an ipa it has a good bodyband good carbonation. Southern tier makes some great IPAs. I love this brewery and I was not let down at all by this brew. I would highly recommend this beer to IPA fans or to just beer fans."

"Overall: This is another good offering from southern tier...2X IPA is certainly flavorful, hop heavy and carries a mighty wallop...though the flavor isn't unique, the paler malt variety used here brings a sweeter side that does it's best to balance out the overall...the higher ABV becomes pretty apparent after about half the bottle...it's a good beer and worthy of selection, i could drink 2 or 3 of these in a night and be very happy, but this isn't something that would come to mind when naming my favorite hop heavy brews out there...(4/5)"

"The color pours a copper/amber, i could care less about lacing and head, as it is the taste that blows me away. The smell of this beer when uncapped is that of of a floral arrangement, and says bottoms up....the ABV content of this beer is great if your the 2 or 3 beer per sitting guys such as myself. 2X by far is the best IPA i have ever had the pleasure of pouring in my face....no matter how much I love 2X though, it still remains my second most favorite adult beverage."

""

"O - Very good DIPA. I don't remember enjoying this as much the last time I had it. It must not of been as fresh when I had it previously, as this bottle is just under 8 weeks old."
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear, classic golden color with a quickly dissipating antique white head. The bouquet consists of citrus, pine, and apricot. The maltiness and hoppiness interact to create a tangy, piney, and sweet nose. Moutfheel is thin and wet, but suits the style. It's not quite as malty as the nose leads one to expect. It's a rather unique tasting IPA. Some pine is present and some Smarties candy. A lot of freshness. Some grapefruit bitterness. Finishes cleanly. Pretty good."
"O: This is a pretty solid DIPA. It's very easy to drink, hides the alcohol well, is tasty, and quite affordable. It's actually one of my go-to IPA's when I don't feel like spending a ton of money."
""
""
"Overall a great beer, a favorite of mine. Hides its alcohol well, and tastes great."
""
""

"Beautiful color. And you get hit immediately with a Great floral aroma. Smells almost like a wilted flower and balanced by malty sweetness. Tastes even better. I savor every mouthful. Lacing all up and down in your class. One of the best IPAs around. A must try for IPA lovers."

"Pours deep gold with strong orange and lighter amber hues topped with a bright white two finger head. Average retention and splotchy, coating lacing. Quite a bit of pineapple, floral citrus and tropical fruit, and a hint of phenol alcohol on the nose. Opens with continued pineapple, edible orchid, mango, papaya, joined by bready malt with a hint of caramel. Finishes smooth and semi-dry with citrus blossoms and moderate grapefruit rind bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied. Smooth, silky mouthfeel that is a touch syrupy on the edges. A solid DIPA, that initially trends a bit on the sweeter side that quick dries out toward the finish."
"O: Pretty solid DIPA, a bit of balance and a lighter body make for quite a drinkable beer even with the hefty abv."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a good IPA that could have been much better without the watery aftertaste. Would fair exceptionally with Italian food."

"O - An excellent DIPA. Can never go wrong with this one. Well done"

"Overall (4.0): Generally speaking, this is a nicely balanced, small-ish DIPA (8.2% ABV is not small, but it’s not one of those gargantuan DIPA by any means). The hop profile opens up a bit as it warms, and in the end this is a very agreeable, not over the top, solid DIPA. Considering it’s typically about $11/ sixer (at least in upstate NY), this is a pretty good value that delivers the hops without clobbering you over the head with either malt or blinding bitterness. Good beer!"
""
""
""
"This is a completely agreeable IPA. Despite being a high gravity beer, I would consider this a fine introductory IPA for someone used to more mild flavor profiles. Take out the sicky sweetness from Sierra Nevada and you've got ST2XIPA. There is a lot going on with this beer without being too agressive. This is one of the most well balanced pale ales I've ever found to be regularly available."
""

"O. this is an easy drinking smooth as hell DIPA and definitely a must try."

"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium light body, moderate to full carbonation, a decent dose of resin. This is a very nice beer for the style and the price. Nothing crazy but very solid and drinkable."

"a sweet ipa, in the waynes world sense, not the sugary sense. pour is real light for the style, clearish and golden to bronze in color. a medium one inch head, pure white, sits on top and slowly mellows. the nose is citrus all the way, grapefruit and lemon, but i am missing the malt id like to see. flavor thought just rocks, malt balances out intense bitter hops, mean and brutal and chewy, but also somehow light and pleasant. i like the finish, its bitter, but more fruit than hop essence, which i think is nice this time of year. really robust hop flavor, but it fades to fruit in that slow drama way. feel is good, enough bubbles and a lazy sort of medium body, its not so interesting on the tongue, but it holds its own. the alcohol is also oddly absent, it doesnt even come out when the beer warms up, just sort of stays away, which is scary and brilliant at the same time. one of southern tiers most drinkable big beers, i really support this, especially on tap in marcellus, new york. who woulda thought?"

"O - I really enjoy the way this beer drinks for a Double IPA, definitely not extreme for the style but really clean, crisp, and pleasant for a beer coming in at 8.2%.

"The taste is exceptional, very well balanced, perhaps too balanced for a DIPA. One would expect the hops to outweigh the malt in a beer like this but they are evenly matched. This beer is well carbonated and has an excellent finish."

"O: It is is probably the lightest DIPA I've had. Truthfully, I liked the idea of the light mouthfeel because it is unique for a DIPA. It wouldn't be all that bad except that it lacks the overall taste of a big DIPA. Besides the ABV, this actually tastes like it is somewhere between a pale ale and a single IPA that is really sweet. I'm not likely going to be drinking this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has the ABV of a Double IPA but reminded me more of a Single IPA, a nice beer decent price but nothing really wowed me other than the drinkability"
""
""
""
"This brew poured with a one finger, thick off white head that shockingly dissipated really quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The body was a clear amber color with very light carbonation. The body was a clear amber color with very light carbonation. The nose on this brew was strong and absolutely lovely, marked with strong grapefruit and a bit of booze. The taste wasn’t quite as nice. The strong grapefruit that was in the nose didn’t come through as much in the taste. There was a definite bitterness to it, but was quickly followed up by a metallic flavor and some malt that really wasn’t in balance with the brew. The body was on the medium side and carbonation was very low. The finish was long and I just couldn’t get the nasty metallic taste out of my mouth. I have to say, given the nose, this beer was a big disappointment. I could go on and on listing the other brews of this style that were better. I wouldn’t have this again."
"It finishes kind of dry, but its really ho hum. Easy enough to drink, and no aspect of it fails, but for being a Southern Tier beer, I had way higher expectations. I have no idea how old the bottles were since it was acquired in a trade, so I would revisit, but ultimately, its not my fault the brewery doesn't bottle date."
"Citrus and caramel notes on the front end. Hop is muted but definitely there. Nice head and lacing if not served too cold. There is a smooth drinkability here which is lacking in some doubles. Amazing under-the-radar alcohol taste, almost hard to discern. A wonderful choice with strong cheese or after some yard work."
"O: Easier to drink than a lot of other beers in the style, but the hop profile of this beer is not as aggressive as the other examples of the style. The alcohol is this beer is well hidden but I would probably classify it as more of a 1.5 IPA (not quite a double). Enjoyable but not a real special beer for the style (which is one of my favorites)."
""
""
"Overall: Compared to Sixpoint's Resin, Southern Tier's 2XIPA doesn't quite measure up. Resin has a much better smell and taste, but both have a comparable mouthfeel. That's not to say that 2XIPA isn't a great beer. On the other hand, Southern Tier's 2XIPA is much easier to drink - which is saying a lot, because even at 9.1% abv, Resin is an easy drinker. I could even call 2XIPA a sessionable beer, and at 8.2% abv that's quite an accomplishment. A very fine beer that I'm glad to have finally tried."

""
""
""
""
""
"Another odd case (Victory and Speakeasy also come to mind) of the DIPA in a range being paler and lighter than the IPA. IBUs are pronounced but there's a lightness of touch that makes this far more drinkable than its """little""" brother. Top shelf everyday DIPA that justifies 3T's reputation."
""
""
""
"Good carbonation level and compliments itself extremely well. Approaching one of my favourites in the style."
""
"Overall, a decent ipa."
""
"2xIPA is biscuity with layers of juicy hop profiles on top of it. Lime, tangerine, and tamarind are all flavors I pick up here. It has body on the lighter side of medium and medium carbonation to match. Bitterness is firm, but not overbearing and long lasting as well. Quite tasty, this is a nice staple year-round to have."
""
"The only thing I can say about this beer is that it definitely did not seem like a Double IPA.The hop flavors and aromas were not nearly potent enough.It possessed a sweetness that let you know it is not a single IPA,yet did not taste overly malty nor was body too heavy.It's flavors were pleasant,hop character quite restrained for a double IPA though.Would like to give it another shot in the future,worth trying again."

"This beer is dynamite and all together excellent IPA. The smell is just right with notes of grapefruit,pine, and a whole host of hoppy goodness. Super crisp taste great long lasting after taste. I have been experimenting with other Double IPA and this one so far in definitely the winner. Even at $10.99 a 6pk this beer is a bargain."

"Poured in a 16oz pint, draft. Taken from notes. Golden orange in color with a tall head of bone colored foam that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Very citrusy on the nose with some grassiness. Tastes big of grapefruit oil and orange peel. Malt is very subdued. Mouthfeel is that of lots of carbonation and a slightly harsh bitter finish. Overall a fair example of a DIPA. It lacks somewhat on the malt balance, but I'd drink it again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - My biggest complaint is the water used in the brewing process. There is something off about it; whether it it too filtered or not filtered thoroughly enough. Light to medium bodied with a bit more of a focus on sweetness this time around. The hops are fresh and delicious, thought I think I would prefer angrier doubles over this one."
""
"O: A solid Double IPA, and I'm glad the ethanol tones from the smell didn't make it into the flavor with the same intensity. Certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Disturbingly refreshing and easy-drinking for an american DIPA. The relatively light body and clean/crisp finish makes it feel more like an amped up brit IPA."
""
""
""
"o - good beer though this one wasn't as fresh as i would have liked but that's my fault for forgetting about it. i'm sure it's got more pop the fresher it is."

"This isnt an overwhelmingly hoppy brew for a double. But this is a great tasting, dangerously drinkable brew here. Great stuff."
""

"The beer pours a light yellow with a good white head. The aroma is a bit of malt and a nice bit of hops with just a hint of floral. The tasste is light malt with a thorough covering of hops. The feel is light and dry. They did a very nice job of blending the malt and hops. You can appreciate both tastes."
"Excellent - an intense double IPA that nonetheless displays good balance between the malt and hops. Bitter but not too bitter, with a pleasing spiciness. The individual hop flavours are indistinct but mesh nicely with the malt and yeast. The only improvement would be an increase in carbonation, which would add to the mouthfeel. Not sure if this quite adds up to twice the 'regular' IPA, but a fantastic brew that is well worth sampling."
"O - This is a nice DIPA. My only """problem""" with it is that one is enough to get me pretty buzzed and I really would like to drink several. It's hard to stop after having just one."
""
""
""
""

"The consumate IPA. For anyone who is a fan of IPA as I am, it will be very tough to match. The flavors, boldness, and look are definition for the genre."

"On rate beer its a 97. @ 8.2%etoh it you will fill it. I found IBU listed @ 55 or unknown. Its a pretty good hoppy beer. Compared to the green flash palate wrecker...it did wreck my palate making me find this beer just good. @ pizza paridisio @ dupont circle it goes for $7 a glass."
"O - This is definitely a unique DIPA. I simply cannot be an advocate for so many malts in a beer of this type. Simply average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is not really what I think of as DIPA. This is simply too English and malty, but with some grapefruity American hops thrown in for good measure. So I would consider this more of a American-style Double ESB, which isn't a style. The name 2XIPA is simply misleading. That's a lot of blathering just to say that this was not what I expected. However, it's very tasty and unique, which is more important than style distinctions."
""
""
""
"Overall not my favorite - though after i purchased the bottle, i noticed it was about 10 months old, so not the freshest bottle."
"For a beer I have passed on so many times over the years, I am finally glad I gave it a go. I wish more American brewers would go the direction that Southern Tier chose in this beer."

"M: Slightly viscous/lightly syrupy, smooth, a tad resinous in texture. Medium body."

"O - A great regularly available DIPA. I will search for this one more. You know its a good beer when you relish the butler afterward."
""
""
"Overall: Glad I picked up a six pack instead of just getting a single. With the warmer days of the the tail end of spring and summer approaching, it's going to be a great thirst quencher in the coming days."
"OVERALL: A real treat of a beer, and I was happy to try it at the special tapping. It is almost as good on tap and in the bottle, but I must say this cask was the best 2XIPA that I have ever tasted."

"The motto of Southern Tier stresses a passion for """vigorously""" hopped beer, and one taste of this double IPA will really give you a feel for how sincerely they have stuck to it. The color and smell are as bold and emotive as anything you will taste from the IPA family, and the taste is everything you would expect given the quality of the appearance and the nose. Uncompromising and superb."
""
""
""

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, light honey-yellow coloring with a light, filmy, bubbly white head. The nose is rich in cedar and pine, with some subtle grapefruit highlights. The flavor is resiny, with peppery hops on a tart, light, grapefruit sweet backbone. Surprisingly light, with a crisp body. The aftertaste is slightly filmy, with a resiny and tart blending to it. Slightly lingering finish, with a bitter, resiny end. Decent brew."
""
"D: similar to the IPA from these guys, the hop character isnt a slap in your face. pleasant for sure, but not what i would expect from a DIPA. if you really want hoppy from southern tier i would recommend their unearthly. and if you can get it, definitely their gemini."
"Overall – The beer has some nice characteristics with a nice mix of hoppy tastes. The major drawback it the rather average body and the somewhat unpleasant bitterness it leaves on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With so many other options out there in the DIPA, or even IPA variety's.... this is a beer I will NEVER try again."
""
"This is truly one of my favorite double IPAs, especially coupled with its ease of access. Like many southern tier beers, the sweetness is prominent, but is coupled with both the hops and, to a lesser extent, the yeast. This makes for a complex and enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- No sign of > 8% ABV here - it is a well balanced tasty DIPA."
"One of my favorite IPAs. Really a double pale ale rather than a DIPA. If you come expecting sweet malt dripping with citrus you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a lawnmower porch sipper you'll be contented."
""
""
"Update 2013 After having many different DIPA's I find this one to be just a little above average and I adjusted my rating accordingly."
""
""
""
""
"pours a standard golden color with a medium head, at first glance it is hard to see that it is a double IPA, most have a huge head and a bit darker in color. Same with the lacing, it doesn't lace as much as other IPA's. Smell is a normal double IPA, has wonderful piney hop aroma that is hard to beat. Taste is wonderful, has a full hop flavor, lots of bitterness but not overpowering but close, a tangy after taste is present as well. Mouthfeel is full, robust and above average. Overall a very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange-yellow amber. Thin persistant head that leaves light lacing. Light aroma of floral hops and light malt. Nice sweet and caramel malt with floral and not too herbal hops. The typical grapefruit part of the flavor is closer to an orange citrus flavor. Malt body has a sweet fruit or nectar component. Not as hop forward as other DIPAs, but makes up for it with a quite different and pleasant malt backbone. Enjoyable and a definate repeat IPA."
""
"O - Very good DIPA from Southern Tier. Very citrusy and sweet with just enough bitterness to balance. The 8.2% is totally masked and this is very easy drinking. I will definitely get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This was an interesting brew for me.  I think Southern Tier is a great brewery, and DIPAs are my favorite style, but this one doesn't really do it for me.  I wouldn't turn it down if it were handed to be, don't I don't plan on buying this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love double IPAs and this one is no exception. Would not hesitate to get again."
"Fantastic alpha acid prowess and drying on the tail end that is captivating the more you drink it yet there is ample malt to provide balance on a higher ABV. Takes some thought to really get into this beer and appreciate the hops and the mouthfeel. Leaves an impression."
""
"Poured a pale golden color with not much head. Lots of small bubbles of carbonation. There is a good amount of malt sweetness and a fair amount of citrus on the nose. This is a very crisp beer, I taste notes of pear and grapefruit. There is a lot of carbonation, quite refreshing. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, not overly hopped. I would love to try this beer on draught."
""
""
""
"M: Light to medium bodied."
""
"O: Very good, but if you had told me it was just a single IPA I would have believed you. Aside from the ABV there wasn't much that signaled fact that it was a double. Still a very solid, tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Nothing that stands out, but it's a solid choice for a DIPA. Starts out nice but I got a little tired of it once I was done. I do like the 8.2% abv however."
""

"D - The flavor isn't incredible and the mouthfeel is kind of rough, but I enjoy this a lot anyway. Will almost certainly have again. This is one of the finest Southern Tier offerings I've had yet."

"O- A very solid double IPA. I really liked the maltyness and sweetness to it and I would love to try some other double IPAs that share the same quality. However I did not care for the finish. It was too bitter and earthy for me, however that wont stop me from finishing it. Not my favorite double IPA but definitely not the worst."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not too much to compare it to at the time I drank it, but was very clean and true to the name so I did enjoy it a lot"
""
""

""
"Very impressed with this crisp DIPA. I'm more a fan of the 'stinky' mega-hop aroma and resinous/sappy character in the flavor, but this beer is a delicious drink. Passed up a Hopslam to revisit this one."
""
"O: great ipa, well balanced, not difficult to drink. Even my wife liked it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear golden with medium head. Smells very citrusy, lemons, orange peel, and some pale malt sweetness. Light bodied for a DIPA, with high carbonation, a bit of resin and a flavor that includes nice citrus notes, a little lemon peel, and some excellent lightly sweet malt backing to boot. A very good beer that is easy to find and won't break the bank. Southern Tier impresses often."
""
"Crisp & clean really well filtered... a glowing orange brew that leaves a light lacing on the glass... super hoppy a stinking fruity assault on the senses... tropical and bubble gummy, intensely aromatic with notes of pineapple, mango and lemon verbena there's also a savory element... onion juice! A Great Double... It must be fresh as there is a really big underlying malt character that gives the impression that it would overwhelm this beer if past a couple of months old... The taste is very similar to the nose and the finish is astringent and dry and lingers offering layer after layer of tropical sweetness, nutty and dense this is an extremely enjoyable quaff!"
""
"I also just looked at the bottle for reassurance when I went to review, this is a DIPA? Am I missing something?"
""
"O- Nice double IPA."
""

"O/D = A solid and relatively very drinkable DIPA. As with most southern tier beers, I find them to be on the sweeter side- not so great with the DIPA."

"O: This was a great DIPA, one of the best ive tried in a while. Balance is what makes this beer great. Its not overwhelming in any one sense besides bitterness. Great floral mix with intense grapefruit and vanilla as well."
""
""
""
""
"O-Really great double, will do again..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look is clear golden, far from amber. Smell is nearly all hops, almost piney, with slight fruit aromas. The flavor matches the nose's pert hoppiness, but feels light and dissipates rather quickly. Overall a better than average beer, barely better than average IPA, but far from my favorite. Southern Tier is my favorite brewery, but this """normal""" concoction isn't in the same class as Unearthly."
"This is the first time that a BA score has ever let me down. This thing is way too unbalanced for me to enjoy or recommend."

"Tried this across the pond, so it can't be too fresh but it's still great. A very sweet, floral and fruity DIPA. Not as bitter as most, but that's ok. Definitely hop dominated with lots of flavor. ABV is totally hidden. Fantastic IPA, right up my alley with the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer. The flavor is outstanding, although for a DIPA that's not all that surprising."
""
""
"This is easily the least malty DIPA I’ve ever had. If in need of a hop fix, this will work well. Personally, I wouldn't mind a little more maltiness to give it more variation. Nevertheless, it’s a good antidote to something like Hopjuice where the malts practically overwhelm the hops."

"Sixer for under ten bucks. First try, poured into tulip. Clear orange/gold, small white head. Lots of hops on the nose, pungent almost musky scent, with lots of tangerine and clementine. Very light crisp feel, bitter hops and booziness resembling champagne. A solid brew but not so distinct"
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip, bottled 12/15/2011. Finally picked one up because they date bottles now. Pours a nice crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of huge grapefruit orange, pine, herbal spiciness, floral, lemon zest, caramel, and light breadiness. Fantastic aromas here, plenty of citrus. Taste of big pine, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, orange, biscuit, caramel, and floral notes. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pine, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, orange, and caramel. Fantastic malt balance in this, bitterness is not overwhelming at all like some DIPAs. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking, but it is still a bit of a sipper. Alcohol is nicely hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is an exceptional DIPA. Great citrus flavor, malt balance, and smooth drinking."

"O- A little disappointed in this one after the nose this beer had on it. This is the only Southern Tier beer I've had that let me down. Im still a huge fan of their work, but this one could use some tinkering. As long as they are still brewing Pumking, Choklat, and Oat...I will be a customer of their's for the forseeable future."
""
""

"I've enjoyed the bottles before but the cask takes this to a whole new level. Much smoother, thicker and sweeter. I could drink this all night. "

""
""
"O- better than I remember, but I think this one could of had a little bit more hop character. But then again, this is just a malty DIPA and not so much in the hop area so maybe it just falls into the malty DIPA catergory instead of the hoppy fruity piney. DIPA catergory. I recommend it and as I recall it was one of the cheaper DIPA 6 packs. Thumbs up from me. Prost!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid DIPA. I think there are a few things that could make this better, but overall it's very enjoyable. I wouldn't think twice about getting this again."
""
""
""
"overall, this is just ok. i think a more interesting malt bill would compliment the hop profile. see surly abrasive for inspiration."
"Overall-This is a great beer. It has a wide appeal. This is an everyday beer for me, affordable, tastes great and you can drink more a few of them without feeling like your tastebuds are ruined."
"O: reminds me of hopslam, but just a little less across the board."
""
""
""

""

"This beer just below room temperature, so I let it sit out for a bit before I enjoy. I feel it brings out some of the flavors that the cold can sometimes mask."
"Bottle served in a tulip glass very cold. Pours deep gold like the fruit of a juice orange. Almost no head at all. The aroma is pink grapefruit. with earthy spices. Malty undercurrents as should be expected for the style. Like it so far. The taste is pretty smooth with growing grapefruit, tangelo, orange peel and hop spiciness. It has a pleasing under current of sweet smooth malts. One of the smoothest 2x IPAs I have had. I like the subtle spiciness. Hops seem a nice blend of American and continental. Well done, balanced with no annoying distractions. Solid."
""
""
"O- I really love most of Southern Tier's beer and I want to love this one too since it is quite a bit cheaper than their other DIPAs, but these particular flavors are just not my favorite. The beer is very well made and very interesting, a nice departure from what has become the cookie-cutter citrusy West Coast IPAs, but I just can't quite get into the flavors from this blend of hops as a beer I would drink frequently."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a solid DIPA. Good value and good flavor. Very drinkable at 8% abv. A repeat purchase for sure."
""
""
"O: Definitely enjoy this DIPA, although a few can get to your head quickly...excellent flavor and good for those who want a beer with a strong, hoppy character"
""
"Overall: I have had this on draft and bottle many times. Such an easy drinking and good DIPA. The alcohol is not even that bad at given the 8%. Looking forward to more of this in the future."
""
"This may be the most sessionable Double IPA I've experienced. I appreciated the unique hop character and the reasonable price. Straight across the board all-around good beer."
""
"This beer is a really good DIPA in a 12oz. format at a respectable price. Now that Southern Tier dates their bottles, I'll pick this one up more regularly."

"Pours a mostly clear pale orange with one finger of creamy offwhite foam, settles quickly to a thin layer, big trails of lace down the glass. Smell: dry, mild pale malt sweetness, grassy, a little pine and pineapple, a little white grape. Reminds of Victory’s DIPA. Taste: sweet white grape in the back, a little white nectarine, light biscuit, grassy piney with a little dried pineapple. Medium bodied, pillowy and prickly. Sticky semi sweet finish. Pretty good in-between IPA and DIPA. Bottled 9/14/2011, Drank 10/21/2011."

"I'm not so sure I like this one... maybe this particular mix of hops just isn't my cup of tea. And yeah, it's somewhere between a regular IPA and an Imperial IPA, just as promised. Sadly, it just leaves me wanting something more. Not my favorite Southern Tier offering."
""
""
""
"O: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I was expecting an extremely hop forward DIPA leaning towards the bitter side, and what I got was a very balanced and light drinking beer. I will revist this beer again."
""
"O: Bit of step-down overall from the Unearthly. It's a great beer, but the DIPA field is quite competitive. There are definitely better, more assertive DIPAs out there, but this one nails the balance quite well, if that's what you're into."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well-balanced and impressive IPA. This more of a regular American IPA, a little too underwhelming for a DIPA. Note: the brewery says this is not an Imperial, but a double. Now, Imperial and double are supposed to be synonymous, but Southern Tier likes to interpret them differently,apparently. Either way, hopheads should really pleased with this. Count me in. Just look at it as more of a standard American IPA, which this is closer to."

"This is one of my favorite beers on the market. Delicious double IPA pours a golden yellow. Smells of hops and citrus. Tastes pop, hoppy citrus caramel flavor. Very smooth to the mouth. Overall a really good beer that I would tell anyone to drink. I would also try southern tiers 422 pale ale. Very good beer from a good brewery."
"Overall, this wasn't bad, but not as impressed as the first time I had this one from a bottle back 20 months ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll usually order this when I see it on draft because it is consistently good. It doesn't claim to be anything it's not. Hat's off to Southern Tier for this brew. Probably my favorite they have produced."
""
"O - such an enigma of flavour, it's all over the map, very easy drinking with no trace of the high octane, its almost a style of its own, I would drink this on the regular if it was available"
""

"A really good Midwest IPA. I won't be trading my Sculpin or Pliny for this anytime soon, but while visiting the region, this is a fine substitute."

"Overall, though the taste doesn't quite live up to the smell for, this is a very good DIPA! Reminds me alot of one of my favorite, Three Floyds Apocalypse Cow, especially in the aroma, but also in the taste. Certainly worth seeking out if fruitier DIPAs are to your liking! Thank you goes out to azdback for this beer!! You're the man, Paul!"

"O- A fantastic Double IPA, lots of citrus flavors, easy to drink, easy to find. Will definitely be getting again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Enjoy the sweet/bitter pithy orange flavors and bitterness levels. Fruit/herb mix of hop flavors are nice as well. In the end, however, there's nothing that really makes this stand out from the crowd of IPAs/DIPAs available today, and the alcohol comes through a bit stronger than it should for this strength. At around $11 for a sixer, it's probably not something I'd pick up again, though finishing this one won't exactly be a chore."
""
""

"Overall I felt this was a great beer. Drinkability of an IPA with the characteristics of a DIPA. Nice."

"Truth be told, I am not the biggest fan with the Southern Tier IPA line-up and this might be my favorite of the bunch. Well done folks."
"Overall, was pretty drinkable for a double IPA and the abv was very well hidden."
"A good brew with excellent extraction of flavor from hops. Very hop forward and bitter, I would prefer a bit more malts to balance the flavor out. Great for a hop fix. More of a 1.5 IPA than a true Double. Would welcome this beer again but wont hurry back to buy it."
"O: Not a bad beer, but nothing really omygosh about it. I wouldn't mind drinking this at all for sure, but not something i'd consider world class."
" It pours a golden color with little head. The pine and the citrus are present. I like the malt with hop combo in this beer . Its big in my book, a good medium mouthfeel and awesome finish. This being a dipa, you do get the alcohol and deep hop flavor. Southern Tier is up and coming. Could be a big hitter on the east coast. Watch out !"
"Overall - The pour alone clues you in that this one will be different than the average imperial IPA. And it is. Such fresh fruity flavors are rarely found in any IPA. I feel like this could be made into a chewing gum. The hops are present, but serving a very different purpose - we have shades of the average IPA, a bit of pine, a bit of a floral here and there in the herbal taste, plenty of bitter background. But overall, this is just a surprisingly fruity beer. A delicious one, to be sure. However, it’s a simple beer. I find that once I get over the surprise of the tropical citrus flavor, there’s really not a lot else to it. The beer is the same from start to finish. Fun, drinkable, tasty, but not a lot to pay attention to. I bet it makes a killer six pack, though."
"Drink- I like this DIPA. It’s a good beer. It had a good balance and some nice bold assertive flavors. Nice to see a good little bottled beer."
"This one's OK but in the end it's one dimensional and leaves me wanting something more."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas."
"Overall: I am glad I took the time out for a special tapping of a firkin. First time having this beer and I was impressed. I am not a big IPA drinker, but if more of them were as smooth as this one, I certainly could become a huge fan."
"O- This beer is about one thing. Hops. If you want a hop fix go here. If you want something else, this won't supply it."
"Overall: By far my favorite Southern Tier beer...it has only one problem. What do you do when you cant find any?"
"Poured into 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark yellow, with a inch of sticky white head, that leaves plenty of lacing. Smell tangerine, pineapple, pine, and a little floral. Taste is all that, with a little grapefruit in the finish and the alcohol is well hidden. Nice body, not light or heavy. Perfect carbonation. This is a very nice beer. Thank you ST for adding the born on date 9/26/11, easily the freshest I have had of this beer and the taste shows."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the bright aroma, and how clean every element of this beer was. The booze is hidden well, and we find a remarkable balance between solid malts and bright hop varieties, of which there seem to be many. This beer is great for the style and incredibly drinkable."
"Nothing horrible but nothing I would ever go out of my way to buy as a bottle or drink on tap."
"Worth trying as it is a good buy... Bought a 6 pack for $9.99 here in North Nj. Others would sell a DIPA like this in a 4 pack for the same price. Enjoy."
"Very very good DIPA. I would buy again and again."
"As far as overall bitterness goes, it's really not that high, because it doesn't come close to ripping the cheeks into a mess. However, the hop flavors are clean and pleasant, and the malt is well into the background. The alcohol is masked so well, and it's brutally easy to drink. This one is in a style of it's own."
"O: solid double IPA, though not much heavier than your bigger regular IPAs. The hops characteristics are much better than standard IPAs, so it's cool. At $3 per 12 oz bottle, not sure if it's a steal or a rip off...could go either way depending on how you look at it."
"I'm a bit disappointed with this one as I quite enjoyed their regular IPA. This is just more malty and alcoholic. I would definitely like to re-review this one with a fresh bottle as it does taste faded."
"Tastes quite nice but finishes a bit full. Overall it is wonderful but heavy.yummmy."
"Well balanced and a very easy drinker, but not one of my favorites."
"Easy to drink, crisp, refreshing. Great beer!"
"O - A very well executed DIPA. I would take this over many higher rated DIPAs. Very nice!"
"Wow....there is alot going on with the Southern Tier 2X IPA...sheesh! The appearance is a golden yellow, clear, with little carbonation and very little, mostly non-existent head...that looks white in color. The smell is complex hops and malt. I believe the hops include Semcoe for the body and slightly citrus notes....other is possibly East Kent Hops. The other two....could possibly be casscade and ???. One of the malts used is sweet....all blended together to mask the 8%+ ABV. The taste is well balanced....hops definitely power the beer, the malt is used to keep bitterness at bay and to help clean the pallate on the after taste. Overall it is a crazy beer, definitely worth trying. One per session would be enough though."
"O- I liked everything about this beer but the taste, extra boose flavored but it was a great experience as being my first double IPA can't wait for hopslam"
"O-A decent DIPA, if ST would start dating bottles this would be a great go to beer."
"Taste is amazing; Sweet and full of citrus. Randomly bought due to higher %. Loved every drop. One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Smell is nothing great. Looks are good. Strong and sedated at the same time. Great for sipping with good friends. Highly recommended!"
"Overall- Great beer, definitely worth the try, will now become part of my standard grouping of IPAs. Stock up on these things. They are awesome."
"Overall I am very impressed with this East Coast effort of a style that I believe the West Coast owns. I can't stand most of the East stuff, but not this one. I enjoyed this as much as Flower Power. Thanks to merc7186 for this one. I have yet to be disappointed with a Southern Tier brew. Keep up the good work."
"Love this one. 2XIPA is once of the best East Coast IPAs when fresh, and I'm glad I found it on cask."
"Pours hazy yellow-golden with a small white head. The head fades slowly. The nose has big aromas of lemon and citrus, along with a pale malts, honey and a touch of herbs. Slightly bitter. The finish is long and hoppy, with citrus, a hint of pine and a touch of herbs. Nice medium body, very drinkable."
"Pours a clear light orange with a 1 inch puffy white head. Smell is of herbal and pine hops, some subdued malt, and a slight cooked vegetable aroma. Taste is of herbal/floral hops, muted malt flavors, and a cooked vegetable aftertaste. There is a slight hop astringency on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation level with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good DIPA but nothing great. The cooked vegetable aromas and flavors seem to fade as the beer warms which is odd but the beer gets better in this regard."
"This IPA comes out of the tap a clear appetizing amber with a decent white head. Hoppy aroma has an underpinning of orange. Hoppy flavor has firm orange undertone that is more sweet than sour. Texture has above-average body and is smooth and fairly fizzy."
"O - Decent beer. Easy to drink which can make the alcohol sneak up on you."
"D: Very drinkable DIPA but lacks any complexity in the taste or hop flavor."
"Quite smooth, surprisingly. The bitterness is not overly abrasive and the hop flavor is huge. The light malts help the hops keep the main focus from beginning to end, has a very nice flow to it for a DIPA. The alcohol is there, but never gets harsh...the beer drinks very smooth. I like it, this one really agrees with me for some reason. One of the few DIPAs I could actually drink a few of in a row."
"Mouthfeel and smooth and creamy with a medium body feel . Overall, nothing too fancy here but a solid enjoyable DIPA."
" Overall holy shit was this fresh. Very good I can't stop thinking about how differant this was from the couple times I have had it before. It was just above average before and fresh it is a A beer easily."
"Overall this is a solid offering from ST, but not one of the better DIPAs that I have had. One would probably be my limit on this one."
"This is oddly restrained for an IIPA. Hops are held back a bit, and the malt really steals the show in the finish. A good brew, but if you're in search of a hop bomb, look elsewhere."
"O: A nice DIPA, but nothing exceptional."
"Reminds me a lot of their standard IPA, just with a greater dose of hops and more sweetness on the body. Solid beer, perhaps not a class of the style, but drinkable."
"Overall this is really solid brew. Could use a bit more depth in the malt department, but the clean, layered hop flavors more than make up for it. No need to get too caught up in style when a beer is this tasty. Cheers!"
"Feels good in the mouth, could be just a touch thicker, but that is a very minor detail. This beer is up there with the best of 'em. Given its awesome availability, it is an exception beer. Go forth and try this if you have not already."
"O: Israel touts itself as 'The Holy Land', while we brag about being the 'Home of the Whopper', which is what I had with this beer. Good call on my part; a very good dance partner for an IPA. This was a damn good beer."
"D: As I worked through the bottle, the sweetness became more of a problem for it. This is a good beer, but I think it falls short of being something I would want multiple of in the same sitting."
"O- not a """great""" dipa, but certainly very good. Has a good nose and some depth in flavor while continuing to remain hoppy and bitter (which is how i like it), carbonation and mouthfeel are good and since it is fairly local i can get them fresh which makes it all the better.Certainly a brew that I would buy in a 6 pack """B+""""
"Surprisingly light color with a breezy white head and a bitter nose. Damn! This is definitely a DIPA on the start--lovely floral aromatics and fruity citrus hops, lots of grapefruit minimal caramel malt base--but by the end the light mouthfeel and lack of finish is apparent. I really like how clean and easy drinking this is for a flavorful DIPA, but it could use a bit more oomph in the end."
"O- A clean simple DIPA, but nothing special. Pretty light and watery for the style. Easy to drink. Closer to an IPA then a DIPA in every way."
"Poured a pale godlen orange, witha white head that fades to some bubbles which ultimately disappear. Leaves behind no retention or lace. Nose of citrus and some tropical fruits. Sweet caramel bill with notes of honey, some biscuit. Odd notes of some overripe banana (odd but not unwelcome) with more pineapple and passionfruit. Taste has nice malt notes with hints of vanilla, biscuit, pine and some tropical hop notes. Alcohol comes through in the midmouth, mildly sticky and chewy mouthfeel. Great feel and good weight. Exceptional drinkability and a hop profile I really dig. Freshness probably takes this down a notch or two, but I'm sure this hits the nail on the head when had on tap. Very nice."
"Overall, one of the better DIPAs I've had, especially from the East coast. Readily available too. I prefer Hop Wallop to this, but is still a very good beer and is more balanced."
"O- A fairly average double IPA with a surprisingly apparent alcohol content for the ABV."
"I liked it, might be my highest rated IPA."
"O- I would call this a more aggresive ipa. The majority of true double ipa's have a significant amount of flavor, this one lacks the punch. It has a very clean, citrusy NW hop and light malt flavor, but is prob not what id reach for if I wanted a palate bomb ipa. Enjoyable but not one of my fav's."
"I like this dipa. A large array of hop qualities and a moderate bitterness that builds and lingers nicely. This will satisfy any hop craving."
"O: Wow, logging on today to review I wasn't expecting an 'A-' overall... Not strong enough (except in ABV) to be considered a DIPA from what I have had. East Coast DIPA perhaps? ;)"
"O: This review is of the last beer in the six pack. I tried to like this one more, but it felt very out of whack in some ways. It was still fresh, but the flavors tasted a little muddled and true hop character seemed to be...dare I say? Lacking. Moreover, a lot of the delicious flavors in the smell did not translate over into the taste. Something must have been up, but I don't know if I'll be coming back to this any time soon..."
"O/D: It's a solid DIPA, but I had it at The Mews in Wakefield, RI, a place where they do a poor job keeping the tap lines clean, and can often impact a beer negatively. Hopefully I'll get to try this somewhere else to edit the review."
"O-This is one of those beers you don't want to end. I wish I had a whole six pack of this beautiful interpretation of a IIPA. PLUS, At first, I had a 4.0 on the smell, taste, and mouthfeel, but as the beer warmed up it became so much more than average. It became one of the best IIPA's I've had. Thank you Southern Tier for holdin' it down!"
"In conclusion, 2XIPA needs a more substantial dryhop regimen. And I'm comparing this to a non-IPA: Lagunitas A Little Sumpin' Sumpin', which shits all over this beer."
"O- Of my 6pk I've gone through so far, this has been my least enjoyed one; maybe because I'm being more analytical by reviewing? It is a great DIPA to just grab and enjoy, but as I review this I'm finding more flaws... Still a good example of the style- especially with great availability."
"O- Have had this one multiple times before and surprised I hadn't reviewed it yet. Still a solid DIPA and would get it again."
"This is as much of a 'session DIPA' as you can imagine. Not high on the hop scale for the style at all but extremely drinkable and tastey. I recommend it a lot. this brewery hits another home run."
"It's good--I never would've disputed that. It represents perfectly, however, the oversaturated hop market in craft beers these days. This showed up at my local Harris Teeter, and I was glad to see it! Still, I can get Two-Hearted there. I get Sweetwater IPA at the local Wal-Mart. This is a malty version of one of those. It's good, but lacks hop appeal of the near-perfect Two Hearted selections and ratios. Had this beer beat 90Min down here, we'd be watching Southern Tier on Discovery Channel. Though good--even among those peers, it's nothing better than what's already around locally. It's mouthfeel falls short of both the aforementioned beers (Two Hearted citrusness and 90Min's malt profile are simply better), but I suppose it's a worthwhile hop rep. A IIPA rep...? I smell an acquittal!"
"Overall it was a decent IPA that I will probably enjoy every now and again but it's nothing too special to draw me in every time."
"This 2xIPA pours brilliantly clear golden color with a bright white head that quickly diminished. The aroma is highly hoppy--burst of lemon citrus, hints of grapefruit and pine. The flavor is quite hoppy--flavors like the nose, high hop bitterness, with an underlying sweet, chewy malt backbone. The beer finishes with a bit of dry hop on the palate and a slightly glow in my belly. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a deliciously hoppy 2xIPA, better as it warms a bit, glad I've got a six pack."
"Enjoy!"
"M- Great body, especially when it comes to temp. It's a hug in a glass to the inside of your mouth. Creamy"
"Get this beer if you find it in stores. It's an excellent example of a Double IPA. Perhaps the best double IPA the East Coast has to offer. Southern Tier seems to be a sleeper or underdog of the breweries out there but is just as good as any high quality craft beer out there."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. One of the better widely available DIPA's. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot."
"O: Don’t get me wrong; this is a good DIPA. There are a lot of great ideas here, especially when you think about how malt-forward it is. It just could have been so much better. At any rate, if I find it on tap somewhere, I’ll be sure to try it. Apparently, the bottled beer I tried pales in comparison to the draft version. That’s great – I know of a few beers that are nothing more than decent in bottles, but really prove themselves in the taproom. Updates to come..."
"Tasty DIPA, sweetness on the finish is slightly off putting."
"O - A good DIPA, not really overwhelming in any area, somewhat muted, but definitely drinkable"
"Overall a really impressive beer. This would be a good one to give someone just being introduced to IPAs. A lot of flavor, not too bitter and well balanced."
"This beer goes down very easy for its abv. Overall I really like the stuff, also really glad they started dating the bottles, its on the lower rear of the bottle, this batch was super fresh so I got a case. I hope the dating works well for ST, though they already cant seem to keep up with demand for 2X in VT."
"A very well packaged hop soup, much to discover in it!"
"I liked."
"Very good beer"
"Overall a really good tasting beer. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely drink it again."
"O: This is a really good DIPA. It's nothing that really made me say """Wow!""" but it was still very delicious nonetheless. I got this in a trade, but it's good enough that I'd buy it if I saw it in the store. If you're a hop-head like me then I think you'll really enjoy it."
"O--This is a pretty good DIPA when it is had on tap, but coming from the bottle it was a bit of a disappointment. I'm going to chalk it up to possible having a bottle that was near its expiration, and not the beer itself."
"O - A nicely balanced, easy to drink DIPA, but not something that really stands out."
"O: A very drinkable double IPA... The lower (than most) abv, helps as does the citrus sweetness. One of my new favorite double IPAs!"
"Taste is definitely on. Sweet orange, bitter grapefruit, has malty sweetness towards the end. Flavor keeps popping as it dances around the mouth with a very nice feel - sweet, bitter, chewy, dry, sweet. A very nice beer."
"would definitely pick this up again. southern tier impresses me everytime i try a product that is new to me. great brewery"
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Slick and resinous. Oily mouthfeel between sips. Pretty tasty DIPA, though lacking a bit in looks and aroma."
"First of all let me say that I judge beers based on what I like rather than the brewing style a beer is supposed to be. I love this beer because it is hoppy and fruity. For a Double IPA it is very sweet. But I find that so many Double IPA focus on the bitterness. I really love this beer because it tastes great and it is easy enough to drink that my girlfriend will share a few with me."
"Overall - This really is a good DIPA, and is an excellent choice if you prefer more citrus hop flavors vs. pine. Definitely try it for yourself - it's relatively available, and is priced low for a DIPA (in fact, this is quickly becoming my goto beer based upon local price and availability)."
"O-a good double IPA that is very nicely priced"
"O - This is a good DIPA the hops are very present but not overly done so I can still feel my tongue worth picking up if you ever see it around"
"enjoyed it a lot - would highly recommend. glad i took the risk and bought a few of these!"
"O: Wonderful Imperial IPA that goes down smooth and hides it's ABV quite well."
"D-Overall i was very impressed. I hadn't looked at reviews but after having creme brulee i wasn't thinking too higly of this company. But wow was i surprized how much i liked this DIPA.. ill def.pick this one up again and if u havent had it def. try it"
"D - Very drinkable. The hop malt balance is very nice from start to end. The hop profile is also pretty solid."
"No dating on the bottle, so conceivably it's older than ideal, but the hops in the nose certainly seem to be of the muted variety. Citric and earth notes are certainly there, but aren't particularly lively. Plenty of light sweet maltiness. Taste is disappointing. It's a smoothish and thickish beer with plenty of sweet pale malt, but a shortage of hop character. An odd hint of savory is almost as prominent as the muted earthy and citric hops. I might give this a try again sometime on tap, but no more undated bottles."
"Clear copper hue. Carbonation can be seen rising to the top of this clear hued brew. This IPA has an excellent flora and fruit aroma. There is so much in the bouquet its hard to begin. I can imagine smelling ripe apricot and plum, add to that honey and daffodil and walnut and you get the idea that this is a complex concoction. While the fruity flowery aroma shows no sign of hops, the flavor sure does. Hops is the first flavor characteristic from this busy ale. Its followed by a sweet honey and beady malt. The fruit is not as noticeable a flavor, probably buried by triple variety of hops. Palate is sticky because of the sweetness associated to the taste. Most IPAs are overly grassy, this one is actually a bit heavy on the honey sweetened malt."
"O: Liked this one a lot. For a DIPA, it's just really smooth and refreshing. Whenever I am somewhere that sells this I will be stacking up FO SHO!"
"Tropical hopping, hints of floral, pine, moderate to heavy bitterness. Quite sweet in the middle, honey and caramel, quite a bit of heat in the finish which is distracting, hint of spiciness, low carbonation. Summary: heavy on the malt, loads of bitterness and alcohol. Not really my thing, not much finesse or depth here."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Deep yellow in color with a orange hue. Poured with a very brief fizzy white head that quickly reduced to a thin wispy cap. Grapefruit and citrus orange hop aromas mesh nicely with pine hop aromas with an underlying sweetness. Medium bodied and lightly resinous with even, refreshing carbonation. Citrus orange and grapefruit flavors in the beginning and through the middle with a light, bready, sweet maltiness beneath. What little maltiness there is, tapers toward the finish as pine hop bitterness is introduced right before a semi-dry ending. This is a solid DIPA. Great citrus and grapefruit flavors, abv isn’t too high, very refreshing, and very available. One of my favorites."
"Refreshing summertime IPA but it will knock you on your ass quick enough."
"o - a total win win here. textbook DIPA....great taste, sticks with you, and great price. This will be a staple in my house"
"This is a real tasty one that matches body and flavor equally. Go for it!"
"A bit of a palate thrasher. It's easy to drink a few, but I can really enjoy one or two to the fullest on any given day. It's a bit pricey, but something I'll definitely toss in my basket whenever I run into it. Great compliment to spicy foods and grilled summer fare."
"Overall- I am somewhat disappointed from this one, I was really expecting more from such a quality brewery that makes some of my favourite big bodied stouts. I mean the typical DIPA flavours were all there but they were not as intense or even as well balanced as a real world class DIPA should be, there is way too much bready malt dominating the palate, it almost takes over all the piney hop flavours. I mean don’t get me wrong I would definitely drink this one again but I think it deserves a bit lower of a score than it has hyped up on BA."
"picked up for $10 a six-pack, so its very good for the value. I typically like my DIPA with a more balanced malty backbone, so this one hits the spot. another delicious beer from southern tier."
"O: Decent imperial ipa – very hoppy and tasty. A nice sipping beer at 8.20% ABV. Not the best double ipa I’ve tasted but definitely one I would grab again."
"This beer pours a clear orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into moderate lacing. The aroma is of pine, grapefruit, mandarin oranges, and hibiscus. The taste is of grapefruit, oranges, hints of lemon, hibiscus, and a whiff of pine. bitterness is present, but not over the top. The mouthfeel is full bodied with rather high carbonation that makes the body seem lighter. Overall, this is a good DIPA that I would happily drink again."
"I tried this beer on June 29, 2011 after purchasingn from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a slightly hazed yellow-gold colour with a thin white rocky head. The aroma was citrusy hops, some perfume, pine and bread. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour is grapefruit, spices, and a little malt sweetness. A good enjoyable beer."
"Appearance is a classic big IPA bright orange. A little light on the head but laces decently. Aroma isn't huge, but there is some malt complexity and plenty of hops. It's satisfactory but not mind blowing or anything. Taste is quite good, plenty of malt backbone and big bitterness up front. Mouthfeel is excellent. Very smooth, with nothing objectionable. Overall, I'd recommend trying it. It's a respectable DIPA and a decent value. Not sure why I've always avoided Southern Tier brews in the past...probably because it's made in NY (like many terrible beers such as Mendocino, ironically made on the opposite coast from its namesake)."
"Hazy deep golden yellow, creamy white head. Nose is not too pungent, but still pleasant--sweet pineapple/tropical fruit and citrus. Decent sweet toasted malt backbone but seems to be lacking in bitterness. Still, alot of nice juicy, fruity hop flavour. Medium-bodied, crisp and refreshing. Highly drinkable, hides the alcohol level very well. Drinks much like a potent IPA, a great summer quaff."
"O: A really good Double IPA. Clean and delicious, not too over the top."
"Overall this a very tasty beer, but a little less intense than you would expect from a double IPA."
"I wasn't a huge fan of the Gemini blended IPA, so this was a real treat. At the price point I'll be back for more to keep over the summer. Great stuff, good to see Southern Tier back in the LCBO."
"Overall, this is one of the worst Double IPA's I have ever had. Its my first Southern Tier beer and I am really disappointed."
"D: Could easily drink this again, and again. Alcohol is well hidden and makes for a deceptively easy drinking imperial IPA."
"O/D - This is a solid offering from ST. Very sturdy and smooth. I would never guess this is 8.2% as it drinks like a normal IPA. Good stuff."
"Carbonated mouthfeel, somewhat drinkable. The only thing this beer has going for it is the hops, and it's not even as hoppy as I was hoping. Sad to say I'm somewhat underwhelmed by this after seeing all of the high reviews I was expecting something better. If this was just an IPA I can see, but as a DIPA it seems like there is something missing."
"-JH-"
"D: Drinkability is scarily high; alcohol is nowhere to be found."
"Overall - I truly enjoyed this beer and even happier i picked it up in my own backyard. thanks to the lcbo summer collection, this beer will now be stocked on my shelf all summer long (i hope!)!"
"O - first Southern Tier I have been really impressed with - this blows away their Gemini - I quite frankly would be hard pressed to change anything about this brew - I think I am finally starting to get the allure of the Imperial IPA -Why oh why did I just buy one!!!! I am buying 12 on pay day"
"Pours a cloudy slightly clear yellow with a decent amount of head in the sam adams perfect pint glass. Tastes slightly citrusy with a lemony grass like finish. A little suprised by the lemon or grass like finish to it. I expected something similiar to a west coast hop bomb ipa like all the hype this beer got when it came out last summer. For 8.2%, it drinks down very well and its easy to put back. I Just expected a little more from the overall flavour. Not bad though."
"Hazy pale blonde colour, minimal white head , not much retention and not much lace. Smell is hoppy, citrus, mango and light grapefruit, a nice soft malty presence, fairly clean and complex nose. Taste is bursting with citrus and hops, mango and grapefruit battle it out on the palate, really well balanced, lush malt, faint alcohol notes are there, some white grape in the finish and aftertaste, nice subtle bitterness. Mouthfeel has tons of hop oil, tame carbonation, medium to full body, good feel. Great stuff here tasty DIPA that really showcases the hop profile, this is nice and hoppy without having to be over the top bitter, lovely balance. I would welcome this anytime."
"Nice Cloudy golden colour, medium carbonation. full finger of head that slowly diminishes to a nice lace. Light floral and citrus hop sent, taste citrus and grassy with a bitter Grapefruit finish. Very smooth and soft with medium carbonation. Overall a great IPA"
"Overall-Not aggressive for a IIPA, but still a good, drinkable beer."
"Overall. for me, this is an enjoyable beer that was somewhat less exciting than I had hoped. Not as intense as a typical DIPA, but a good beer. The alcohol content is dangerous, as it would be very easy to drink a number of these in a row- it really does not come through."
"Pours into a snifter a light golden/amber color with approximate 3/4pm creamy white head with sticky lacing. Aroma is of hops, flowers, fresh cut grass, some pine, some spices. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with fair carbonation. Taste is of all the aromas with slightly more spice. Excellent DIPA."
"Really surprised by this one. It wasn't really that bad, but I just was expecting more I guess. Southern Tier still ranks as one of my favorite breweries though."
"O- I thought this was a well crafted DIPA. It's very drinkable, and you can't taste any alcohol, so be careful! It's also affordable, and that's good for a DIPA. I'd buy this again and again."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a very slightly hazy golden with a scant head and pretty nice lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet and beguilingly piney. The taste is similar- sweet malt base folowed by a pine slam. Not wxactly balanced, but the malt and pine play off one another nicely. Nice bitterness and very smooth in the mouth. Nice beer."
"Overall, it's quite refreshing while still packing a wallop of well-rounded hop flavours. The aroma is particularly impressive."
"This is fantastic fresh. It's pretty rare to get something from out of state that was bottled on 5/31/11 and consumed 6/9/11, let alone a DIPA. Still good with a few months on it, but this is world class beer fresh."
"Great, must try beer!"
"Worth a try, but not a DIPA I would go looking for."
"O: A nice double IPA. Still hasn't broken my top 5, but if I made a top 10, this might be in it."
"Solid, very hoppy."
"Overall: The nose didn't impress me to begin. However, the taste and mouthfeel were better than the aroma and worked well together to completely mask the ABV. The intensity in aroma, flavor, and color was less than I would have expected for a DIPA but a good beer nonetheless."
"Overall: Pretty well produced but not astounding or memorable. A good buy at 6 for $10 though."
"O - A very nice IPA. Glad I tried this one!! And I'm glad I have more."
"Notes - This is 8.4%?!?!?! you would never know. This is session-worthy drink-ability and based on how much flavor is in this beer, I think it's time this beer gets recognition as a heavyweight of the style."
"The body was good, crisp and clean, not thick or sticky like a lot of examples. Drinkability was very good, the beer went down easily and I had a couple. Overall, a very nice brew. If you're looking for an ImpIPA that doesn't kill the palate, this is your beer."
"I did pick up a little orange clove flavor, just enough to make this brew very enjoyable."
"This IPA pours out a bit lighter than expected. It's got a bright yellow color with a very slight haze. The head is fluffy and white. The smell is very citrusy, specifically lemon comes to mind. The taste is very hoppy with a damn good pine flavor in there. The mouthfeel is lighter than the Unearthly. It's a very drinkable but highly flavorful IPA. Very good and worth trying."
"D: Very drinkable. I'd love another and will buy a sixer. Exceptional."
"O - This one confuses me. Just wonder what they were going for with this one. Just doesn't float my boat."
"This a really drinkable double IPA. If you had blindly put this beer down in front of me I would have guessed it was just a standard IPA ... there are many other options out there that are better examples of the style."
"Overall it's a good beer, but not great. Enjoyable though, and a fairly good value."
"I don't get the angle on this at all for a double imperial. It seems like perhaps things were all set for go and then someone turned everything down by several notches. I'll pass on this one kind of disappointed to say the least."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Solid carbonation."
"Taste is yummy, with a nice malt backbone to support the sweetly hoppy journey. I don't get much bitter with this one, as it's a balanced mix of the hops and malts. Beautiful, and one I'd love to revisit."
"GOOD, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"2XIPA is just an IPA. It's alright, but it doesn't give you the impression they lost sleep over coming up with the recipe."
"O: Quite a nice double IPA, made better by the fact that it's easily accessible and is relatively inexpensive."
"Beer is thinner than expected, moderately bitter at the back, interesting overall. The hops are mostly piny but overall it is a bit too malty for my tastes. Overall just a decent, nothing too special here DIPA. Next..."
"Hides the abv really well. Not listed on the bottle and would not have guessed this topped 8%."
"A well put together DIPA. I could sit and drink a 6-pack of these. At 8.2% though, I'd be hurtin... though it would be well worth it."
"Overall would get 6 packs of this on a regular basis. Good stuff."
"Overall: A great IIPA, though much sweeter than I expected. It was nice to be able to try this on tap. I can't say I would drink this regularly, but it was a darn good beer and works very well in the IIPA style."
"Drinkability/overall- this beer was pretty solid overall, i rated it a rare 4 all across the board, all aspects were pretty solid and on point with nothing really jumping out as spectacular but all very solid and enjoyable y good, a beer i would try again for sure maybe not the best double ipa i have had but very good"
"I usually have a very short attention span, but when I sip on this beauty, I am able to focus on the flavor, and look forward to the next gulp immediately afterward. I enjoy this beer the most when I'm chilling SOLO, because when I'm in a social situation and I drink this one, I can only focus on how good this brew tastes, rather than engage in conversation. Southern Tier 2XIPA makes my girlfriend jealous!!!!"
"Pours a pale golden base with a 2 fingers of white head that fades quirky to a nice thin layer of lace (poured vigorously). Smell is nice, but very sweet - sweet malts, honey, more honey, and touch of tropical fruits, mostly dried pinnaple. Sweet taste with nice mouthfeel. The honey dominates at first, but the hops come though on the mid palate. Overall a good brew when fresh at a great price point."
"Really a surprise brew, I've had Unearthly and it's decent stuff. Nice and fruity, lots of citrus. fairly light for a DIPA, but I like that it's not over the top sweet. Never read a bio but it does taste like they use a little honey in this one. Really a very nice DIPA that won't dissappoint, and it's not really expensive. Really worth a shot."
"Clear gold with a thin, soapy white sheet on top. Sweet juicy tangerine and pineapple nose - lemon zest and peach. Sweet pale malt, sticky floral, juicy hops. Pear, grapefruit, and lemon with a certain herbalness and a touch of resinous pine. Oily, medium body. Fruity and zesty...solid."
"Really nice. Definitely the most balanced DIPA I've had in my short craft beer journey. Will definitely get this again."
"Pours a nice clear amber/copper color with little froth on top that lingers on top. The scent does scream IPA but it does have a dryness to it with a slight hops scent. The taste is bold and full of flavor. Very crisp and the bitterness is perfect. Very slight hints of wheat and citrus. I was slightly afraid that this would be too bitter for me but it wasn't. May not be the best beer ever made, but it's definetly an """A"" quality beer."
"O- This is a solid DIPA with really nice hop characteristics that is balanced nicely with some sweet malts."
"Overall: When fresh, this DIPA is outrageous. But, as some reviewers have noticed, it does fade quickly. A growler won’t last long- it literally dies while sitting on the glass! Out of the bottle is very good too, though. Well balanced, delicious. Alcohol is not a problem at first, but it soon catches up and hits."
"Overall, this is not the Pliny competitor that some think it is. It's a bit too one-note to compete in that realm. It tastes pretty good, but it wears thin quickly."
"Golden and a nice yellow, very thick white head. High carbonation. I get grapefruit, pine,and little bit of a mustiness. The taste is full of grapefruit, mangoes, citrus, with a solid bitter end to it. Does it stand out from the pack? Not really. But this beer is an extremely drinakble and solid IPA. Reccomend."
"overall southern tier did well on this one creating a nice well balenced double ipa which does not overpower you with hops yet still has a nice hop profile. Possibly my new go to ipa."
"O: A nicely balanced imperial IPA topping out just over 8% ABV. There's a lot to like in the malt bill on 2xIPA, especially if you like a bit of buttery diacetyl with your hops. Hops seem a bit stepped on in areas where you'd hope they'd punch your tongue, but there's something to be said for modesty and achieving a balance. Very good stuff, I'd surely pick up a bomber."
"Pours a pale yellow, and has about an inch of head. Great lacing. It smells sweet and tastes of citrus fruits with lots of intense hops coming through. It tastes hoppy, citrusy, and light. It has a nice caramel-like malt taste. The mouthfeel and carbonation are closer to that of an IPA, but great overall. Bitter at first, but it subsides gradually, making this a very drinkable beer. Dry finish. The above 8% ABV alcohol is hidden very well. Awesome beer at a great price (8.99 for a 6 pack)."
"O: This beer is extremely well balanced. If you're a fan of hoppy beers but aren't one to usually go for DIPAs, give this one a try."
"O- For the price and the drinkability, this beer was solid. I could hammer this back, which could be bad...."
"A beer with lots of promise. The appearance and mouthfeel are very, very good and the way the alcohol is hidden is impressive. All this needs is some hops - and lots of them."
"O: Overall it's a good beer. I really like it as an IPA and I guess you could call it imperial by the alcohol volume. I would have liked more hop aroma and some non-bittering hop flavor. I didn't get the citrus hop flavor I smelled. I would drink it again, mostly because it's one of the few ST IPAs that I can get in a regular sized bottle...and it has a decent price tag. It's not my favorite of their IPAs though."
"This beer has a lot of interesting qualities, combined in an unusual way. It's not as hop-forward as you expect from an IPA, certainly not as alcoholic as you expect from a *double* IPA, and the carbonation is also relatively low for the style, though delightfully silky. There's plenty of hops flavor to dig into, however. Piney, yes. Floral, definitely—like drinking hops infused rose pedals. It's also a tad buttery. As I said, unusual, but quite likable, and quite drinkable. Three left in the sixer, and they may just get finished tonight. ;)"
"If you enjoy the true taste of American hops (even without the bitterness), and want a crisp, clean, extremely fresh tasting pale ale, I highly suggest you try Southern Tier 2XIPA."
"Overall: Very good beer. I enjoy this, though there are a few others for the price that I prefer. I would recommend it to others."
"m/o: mouthfeel is good, nothing making me say it's THE BEST, but it is damn drinkable for a dipa! These are my favorite imperials: the ones that are incredibly hoppy, but still maintain drinkability to the fullest extent, and aren't overly bitter. This beer truly was a surprise; I seem to have worked my way on the southern tier totem pole starting at the wrong point. I started with gemini ($9/22oz) and was somewhat disappointed for the price, then I got the oaked unearthly ($8/22oz) which was much better, in fact, great, but still so pricey. But lo and behold the southern tier 2xIPA for ($10.5/72oz) is my favorite! Do yourself a favor and buy this beer before splurging on a bomber, or maybe even the regular southern tier IPA."
"Pours a yellow amber with perfect head and an awesome nose. big hop presence in the nose here. Great IPA and in my opinion the abv is low enough where you could have a few and it would feel great. I loved this beer and I would absolutely buy it again."
"The beer was very enjoyable and easy to drink, infact I finished mine off a little too fast and the growler was nearly empty before it got back into my hands for a second round. I will defiantly be on the look out for this one again and pick up a few if I run across it in the store."
"This is definitely a good dipa-the aroma and flavor weren't outstanding, but both were good, and the beer was exceptionally smooth. There's a slight hop character near the back end of the flavor that almost strikes me as vegetal/green olive, but I can't quite pin it down. I don't love that piece, but it's not wholly unpleasant, and it doesn't last for very long."
"Mouthfeel was good, overall, I think this was outstanding and I'll likely be buying it again."
"the 2xipa is fantastic. The smell is a great complex mash-up of itrus and piney florals. The taste is very crisp and biting. A rich floral and piney citrus flavor is promanant through out. If you like ipa's you won't be dissapointed. This is one of the better ones I've had."
"Overall: Like all of ST's brews, its a bit sweet and malt-forward. However, its a good example of an East Coast DIPA. Solid drinkability, readily accessible and remarkably cheap. At $9.99 a sixer, it may be one of the only DIPAs that beats Hop Stoopid in the price department."
"A good beer, and a good IPA. While I'd say I still prefer the West Coast variety (probably for no better reason than that I am accustomed to it), this is probably the best example I've had from the East that still retains its distinctive character."
"I would recommend this brew. A very nice sipping DIPA for a overcast day. Thanks for shipping Kevin!"
"I was looking for a hop fix, and didn't find it here, but still a clean, well made beer. Not sure how this qualifies as a DIPA outside of the alcohol content."
"Overall, this is a decent ipa, but nothing I would go out of my way for. Average and somewhat drinkable."
"Was expecting a very sweet DIPA from this one as on the package it says well balanced 3 malts 4 hops or something like that. It pours a very golden crisp and clear looks like a belgian IPA. Leaves a very pretty white head and laces well down the glass. Smell is floral and a bit medicinal with a little smoke and a little soap. Taste is rather different but hoppy though not hoppy as hell or a least not enough to be a DIPA. The uniqueness of the brew fades as it warms and gets a little less complex. The alcohol becomes more pronounced and noticable and the medicine taste mixes with the floral and resin not in a bad way - rather pleasant. Mouth feel is a bit sticky and mildly oily. Had this with some extra sharp cheddar and really was great. Would buy this brew again to try with a meal."
"O-Overall this is a real interesting DIPA. Not overly drinkable so, you really need to take your time with this one. Decent stuff, but I think I would go for their IPA over this one."
"O: While not quite as startling as many DIPAs, this is definitely no slouch (I might have named it 1.5XIPA). Plenty of hops without the bitterness that can be so tiring. The downside, such as it is, is that it's easy to keep drinking this. And at a very well hidden 8.2% ABV, this can be a problem. While Southern Tier brews a fine line of go-to beers, I've never really been blown away by any of them. 2XIPA is a notable exception. If you've got a craving for, say, DFH 90, this won't do it for you. But if you want to engage in conversation on non-beer topics while smugly enjoying your beer, this is an excellent choice."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a fluffy white head that turns to a thin white lace around the edge of the glass. Piny, and grapefruit citrus perfume come off first, then heavy sweet malts take over. The taste is almost the same but the citrus seems more pungent and the bitterness of the hops tops off the sweetness of the malts for a nice blend. 2xipa has a medium body to it that plays well in the mouth, sweet, bitter and hoppy as a DIPA should be. Overall this is a damn fine DIPA that is very reasonably priced."
"O - Maybe not my go to DIPA but I admire that this is a solid beer."
"O: This beer is certainly tasty, it is on the sweet side for my taste, but I can't knock it for being potent and flavorful. With the bevy of strong American IPA's out there, this won't be a staple beer for me, but once in a while I'm sure I'll go for one. This is on the """ its good but it should be good, not amazing, but good""" sort of category for me. This is my first Southern Tier beer, and I am impressed, look forward to trying some more. Obviously, this is a well crafted beer."
"O: I hate to score this low as I'm pretty sure the 6-pack I picked up is pretty old, but I kept my optimism for a much higher-quality fresh product in mind during the review. Unfortunately I couldn't find a batch number or freshness date on any of the packaging for the life of me, so when I made the purchase I hoped it would be fresh. Alas, I'm simply basing this review on what is in the glass, so hopefully I'll find a fresher sample to try in the future and amend the score to more accurately reflect the quality A+ worthy brew I'm sure Southern Tier 2XIPA is in reality."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear pale amber/orange color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light grapefruit hops, flavor is grapefruit hops and caramel. Higher ABV is hidden. Nice DIPA. $2.49 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"One of the better cask ales I've had."
"Drinkability: Goes down exceptionally easy. Barely any alcohol presence whatsoever, nothing really too overpowering. The taste is somewhat faint but nice."
"O: A good, drinkable DIPA with a nice, rather unique hop profile that's enjoyable. Would drink again, though not my preferred hop profile."
"A good offering with 2X of something. Whatever it is.... I like it."
"Prost!!!"
"Good price, good taste, good beer, goodness."
"Cheers!"
"D/O: A very quaffable DIPA, and one that should appeal to many. Since the alcohol is well hidden, it can definitely hit you hard if you aren't expecting it"
"this was right out of the bottle sorry to say. Late night drink and I wasn't too worried about the glassware. Nice dark gold color and showed a lot of carbonation. nice hop punch. Full of avid and resin. Nice pine like aroma. Huge in the mouth tons of flavor and a bite for sure. Transparent and no sediment. Smooth. Dry. Good hiding of alcohol. Good for style. Leave me wanting a little bit more. Not up with odells new release myrcenary. But still great"
"o: a good IPA. the extreme bitterness it leaves me with is a bit much, though the complexity of the taste and the actual 'stages' it goes though as I take a sip make me happy to be drinking it. I gladly will accept another one from my fridge shortly."
"O- Overall a very good double IPA. Very drinkable and interesting. Cheers!"
"The feel of this beer is medium to slightly heavy with a good feel to it. It goes down easy but does have a bit of a bigger feel to it."
"a tad brisk as it is about as much bitter and clove honey sweet. Rather middle of the tongue citrus. Clear with some sharp sticky head. Nose is orange, clementine citrus. Sweetness. A lean carbonation. And a somewhat syrupy balance with a somewhat bitter pine."
"Attractive gold colored body was clear, and the pour formed a one finder thick head in the pint glass. The smell was pine, hay, and rain soaked earth, and had a caramelized edginess when inhaled deeply. The taste was citric (grapefruit and tangerine) with a sugary sweetness. More of hop showcase, than an assault, the flavor turned peppery at the end of the sip, and stayed that way in the aftertaste. The beer felt sticky and coating in the mouth, and the alcohol warmth was not intrusive. A balanced, yet flavorful DIPA to keep in mind when the craving hits."
"I'm not very impressed and become less so as the glass wears on. Perhaps this is an older bottle? I hope so; it would be pretty dismal if this is how the beer is supposed to be. Though not undrinkable, I poured out the last quarter of the glass. I won't be looking for it again."
"This beer looks like a pilsener! Aroma is very, very nice - fruity/floral, not piney hops. Taste is more bitter than the vast majority of DIPAs, but the hops flavor is terrific. Mouthfeel is too watery and the alcohol comes out too much. Basically, this is an extremely hop-centered beer. That is just fine, but the low body, dryness, and alcohol heat don't really balance the hops. It needs malt (it's rare for me to say this!). Terrific value."
"A little heavier than I would like on the body, but it's got good carbonation and nothing's really a deal breaker here. Overall, just another solid offering from Southern Tier. More of these will be enjoyed I'm sure."
"something between gold and orange, pretty. citrus is big and juicy. i want to bite into the glass. it's pretty bitter with the citrus and a bit of floral. some malt sweetness definitely evident, unlike the booze which is not really noticeable. the first one was tasty, the one the next night was even better. This beer is growing on me quickly."
"A very easy drinking DIPA - but not what I'd expected. That's probably more my fault than Soutehrn Tier's..."
"overall a very good DIPA that comes in a 12 oz bottle, although I wish I had several bombers of it right now. Try this beer if you get a chance!"
"Yet another quality brew discovered at Mikro in Hamden, CT. It shows a clear yellow amber color with a modest white head and decent lacing. The aroma offers a pleasant lemon-pine idea with a bit of apricot wheat in there perhaps. The flavor says big pine and citrus hops with some banana oak. Bright and reasonably drinkable for the style. Slightly cloying, medium plus bodied with modest carbonation. A quality brew with good hop satisfaction."
"Taste is what I expected from the style, again getting more orange than typical. Alcohol finish has a slight solvent note to it which keeps me from rating much higher."
"D - Fantastic for the 8%"
"D- 4.5 A very nice offering all around. Hop heads: I don't consider myself one yet and I love it. It goes down very easily for its high ABV and is smooth and refreshing. I'd put it close to - if not on par - with Bell's Hopslam. Glad to have Southern Tier in KY now!"
"Pours a brillantly clear straw to golden color with a fizzy white head that does last around the edges. The aroma is almost completely citrus and grassy hops. The bitterness is not as high as you would think with such a hoppy aroma; I would say there is a medium bitterness that lasts to the finish which is dry. There is a light alcohol flavor which is blended well with hop flavor and a balanced malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium-light with medium-high carbonation. There is only a light alcohol warmth with very little astringency. Overall a good example of the American IPA style and a beer that has that textbook Southern Tier hop profile."
"Overall this one is pretty damn good to me and it was the first in a night of great beer. Very balanced hop flavor on this one, would definitely pick it up again."
"Overall - This is one hell of a DIPA, and I could certainly drink the hell out of it. I would never have known it's a 8.2% abv beer. Very Drinkable and I'll be buying more."
"Pours a cloudy, orange and gold, not the thickest head nice lacing. Smells of flowers! Sweet flowers and pine resins. Some pineapple. Very pleasant tasting. Sweet upfront, moves into a mellow hoppiness at the end. Very pleasant mouthfeel and despite the 8%, this is a very easy drinking beer. I'm impressed."
"A great Imperial IPA, unique in complexity, love the lacing! And no alchol taste...all flavor!"
"I poured this from the bottle in to my Duvel tulip. The hop aroma instantly blew back at me. I knew then this was going to taste great. The copper colored ale was topped with a frothy white head that stayed and stayed. The hops dominate the aroma as they should. There may be just a slight hint of a sweet honey in the way background. The taste is just as it smells. DELISH!!!! This is well balanced with malts but manages to keep the emphasis on hops. Great full bodied ipa with moderate carbonation on the tongue. I would suggest that you give this one a try. If your a hop lover I insist you try this. WORLD CLASS!!!"
"D: Not a bad beer, but this one doesn't really add up as well as it should -- the first impression is very favorable, but the less solid qualities put a damper on the brew. I think aiming for a more balanced, malty DIPA wold be a good direction for this beer with a bigger dose of malts, especially those that provide caramel flavors."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability- The ABV is undetectable, but the astringency is a bit annoying. 2.5/5"
"D: Goes down pretty smoothly, though the lingering bitterness hurts it. Overall, definitely the best and hoppiest beer Southern Tier makes, far better than their Unearthly beers. And for $9-10 for a sixer, it's a great deal and outstrips many more expensive representations."
"D-although i'm not a huge fan, it is definitely an easy drinker. it certainly does not fill my hops quota though. i'm sure i'll have some again some time."
"I feel late to the party on this one and I want to call Hugh Sisson at Clipper City to let him know ST is brewing a Loose Cannon. He probably knows and is flattered. This is a great hophead's addition to the ST lineup. Body is friendly, not """unearthly""" with nice ramping of flavor, malt pushed back thanks, light honey sweetness, solid hop finish."
"D: Booze is light, body is thin but taste is average"
"D - I found it very drinkable for how high the ABV, goes down very smooth. Not exceptional, but solid."
"12 oz. bottle, served in a tulip glass. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a good, foamy, off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, grass, pine, and citrus. Flavor is caramel, orange and grapefruit, resin and pine, and wood. Mouthfeel is medium, with a bitter and slightly dry finish. Good beer, very nice balance."
"Recommended. An excellent non-extreme DIPA in my opinion."
"I ended up liking this beer a lot more than I thought I would. Give it a shot if you see it."
"Mouthfeel is good, but a very well crafted beer that is very drinkable."
"Easy to drink, dry without being too dry. This beer drinks well, the carbonation is great, but I can't say anything about this is blowing me away either."
"D: This beer will destroy your taste buds for the night, but in a good way. It is pretty high in alcohol and cost so I wouldn't pound these, but I will have two or three."
"D - Drinkability is high with some good ABV for a DIPA and not too crazy flavors. Still not anything to write home about."
"D- I have come to expect Southern Tier beers to be sweet and I appreciate it in most of their beers. This one was just not one I wanted it to be. Overall, I will gladly accept a 2XIPA, just won't seek one out."
"Conclusion: It is a respectable offering from Southern Tier but in my opinion not as good as Unearthly. I could drink it in a session with no problem. I'm a die-hard hop head and brews like HopSlam and Dreadnaught will win my vote every time over this beer."
"extremely drinkable, it packs an 8.2 abv punch but it masks it very well. I like this beer and was suprised yet happy that I didn't review it yet."
"4.0 D: Very nice west coast style DIPA. Great smell and great taste, but from experience the candied fruit aspect becomes too much three or so bottles in. Still a damn good beer at an even better price."
"A solid entry in the double IPA category for Southern Tier. Nice balance of hops bittering and sweetness. There is a touch of citrus, leaning toward grapefruit, in the hops, but the flavor is not particularly pronounced. There is also just a bit of a rawness in the hops, hinting of fresh hop cone and oil. The finish is just the barest bit rough around the edges, but in a fresh way. Nicely done."
"This beer changed my friggin life! Had it on tap at Blue Monkey. The smell alone let me know that it would be good. White grape. A harmonious blend of hops. Perfectly filtered. Alcohol content not too high. So unbelievably lovely :) I only wish it was on tap EVERYWHERE! Get it in a bottle if you can find it. And buy LOTS of it!"
"Since the bitterness is manageable, the sweetness cuts the high abv, and body is rather light, this double ipa ends up being a surprisingly drinkable brew, especially considering the stats. I say, """Go for it! Connect four!""""
"D: Very drinkable, only held back by the slightly funky middle taste that lingered after enough consumption."
"D: Very drinkable, could probably kill a sixer without much issue even at its higher ABV"
"D: Very drinkable. On my 3rd beer now. Even at 8% this doesn't slow me down. Very refreshing and drinkable. I will make sure to purchase this beer again. Great value for the price."
"Overall a pretty tasty brew. Alcohol is hidden very well and hops and alcohol become even less conspicuous as the volume retreats."
"D: As smooth and balanced as it gets. This IPA is very well done and the fact that it isn't an overwhlelming bitter hop bomb makes is increasingly tempting. I could put down the sixer if it didn't put me down first!"
"Single, twelve-ounce copped from Total Wine & More... Copper, amber-colored hue with slight carbonation and a medium-bodied head... Sharp, pungent aroma replete with hops and a slight alcohol presence that surprisingly was nowhere to be found in the taste. Alcohol well-masked behind a hefty ABV of 8.20%. Good stuff from Southern Tier. A rich, satisfying Double IPA that hits hard... Recommended...."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for a DIPA. Despite its aggressive hoppiness, this beer is quite easy to drink. Add that to its higher-than-average ABV and you've got quite the deadly (read: excellent) combination. While it's not necessarily the most flavorful or complex DIPA, it's certainly the most drinkable, which is worth a few bonus points in my opinion."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, some sticky and dry feel. Drinks nicely for a DIPA, the alcohol is in check, and this is definitely something I would drink in the future."
"If I had 5 more I would drink them right now. Get some of these, you will not be disappointed."
"D: Very good DIPA. Alcohol catches up to me after one though, so not sure how many I'd drink in one sitting. Super hoppy but well balanced."
"Medium (not full) up front, the beer is not as robust as most maltier Impeial IPA's. Instead, the beer is crisper, cleaner, and more hop dominant than most because of the dry malt sweetness and high attenuation. There's no attempt for balance here, just a display of hop dominance across the board. This is generally what ordinary IPA's do, but at 7%abv. This one does it at 8.2%abv and does so very nicely."
"This is a welcome departure from Southern Tier's imperial series. 2XIPA is a very drinkable (and affordable) alternative to the overdone and overpriced Unearthly. This isn't in the upper echelon of DIPA's IMO, but it is close and it gets points for price and availability."
"D - For the ABV, great session."
"D - Drinks more like an IPA with lots of hop flavor, this beer will not bowl you over and it is easy to have more than one."
"O- A very good beer...A wonderful example of a DIPA."
"A god big IPA, but the hops are a bit one dimensional, the malt although over roasted in flavor is what saves this one from being a sweet bomb."
"d - certainly a second could be on order"
"D - Unbelievably smooth for such a high ABV. While not a true Imperial IPA, there is a lot going on with the flavor profile of this beer. I suspect my bottle is on the old side, and would love to try a fresh bottle to compare."
"D: The alcohol is relatively well masked from the taste so it isn't that difficult to drink considering its strength."
"It goes down easy although I sense the moderate abv. in this brew, and the hops really battle it out creating an overall fierce taste. This is an all around good IPA by Southern Tier, but something was missing for me."
"Alcohol is hidden very well and lends well to a session. Not a hop explosion but I am impressed with the restraint in which flavour equilibrium is created."
"D - Very drinkable; I wanted another right away."
"Drinkability is really good as well. Not overly warming and fresh."
"Not quite as good as Unearthly but still worth a look for the price."
"One of the top 1% of beers in the world (or at least beers available along the east coast US). Alcohol content and flavor just right. Enough to make you feel good but not too strong to make it unenjoyable. Good session beer for those who enjoy a hoppier draft. I suggest getting it straight from the brewery, great experience and made by people who truly love their beer."
"A good imperial ipa with low alcohol for the style, this beer is hoppy while not overly boozey like some of the imperial ipas I've had. Smell is heavily hoppy with a bit of herbal notes. the beer poured golden orangish with an off white head. It tastes as good as it smell with lots of hop and citrus flavors to cover the tongue. It has a suddsy feel to it. I find this an easy example of the style to drink."
"D - I've been drinking many of the hopped up DIPAs lately, it's nice to go back to a beer that attempts some balance and does it well. Great drinkability for a DIPA, and could easily be a """session""" beer if not for ABV."
"Pours a light orange/amber, smallish head to it. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Medium bodied, tons of flavor here. Nice hoppiness but it's not overbearing, balanced VERY well. Compared to most imperial/double IPA's this is a smooth drinker. Way too drinkable for its 8.2% ABV. Highly recommended, won't let you down."
"D: Very enjoyable with balanced hops and malts. Not overtly bitter, but rather smooth and crisp all around."
"D: Good beer with a different approach than I thought. Good pine notes and hop profile make this a beer to try. However, I would not run out and get this one all the time."
"D- This is a fantastic beer, and quickly becoming one of my favorite styles! I love almost everything from Southern Tier, and this is another excellent example!"
"A very nice example of the DIPA style. Appearance was a ever so slightly hazey golden color with a nice tight cap of white foam. Aroma was grass, grapefruit, citrus, and pine. The body is perfect on this beer not too thick or thin just right for the style, medium light body. Taste is hop flavor, hop flavor, and hop flavor with mild bitterness, but not out of balance also no heat from the alcohol either. A great interpretation of the style."
"Not a huge malt bill here, but it still remains a well balanced beer. Easy to drink and perfect for warm weather days. I could probably knock back a few in a sitting before moving away from the citrusy-ness of this DIPA."
"Drink ability is okay. I could have another. Easy drinking. But they're so many better IPA's I'd get bored after two."
"D- very easy to drink and that could possibly get me into trouble! :) one of the better dipa,s I have had."
"This beer is highly drinkable. It's the first time I've had an 8.2% ABV DIPA served in a 16oz pint (I suspect it was an honest mistake but the bartender, I didn't realize the ABV was so high until the review right now or I would have spoken up) and it left me wanting more. Had the draft list not been so good that night I definitely would have opted for another."
"Pours golden yellow to pint glass. Crystal clear, very few bubbles. Small cap of lace. Smells hoppy (duh)... Piney, resinous, grassy, lemons. Flavors are similar. Lots of lemon flavors and some malty, reaidual sugar to balance the IBU. lemon drop candies? Nice, tasty, well balanced IPA. Mouthfeel is confusing... Somewhere between creamy and sparkly."
"Drinkability is high. This could be a go-to beer, with a decent price point and nice, relatively mellow flavor (for a DIPA)."
"D: Overall this IPA was just what I needed after so many over the top IPA's that focus on bitterness and loose sight of the hop flavor. This is definitely a beer a will buy again, and again probably."
"D - I told the bartender that this was (Expletive Deleted) delicious, and he agreed wholeheartedly. One of the best Double IPAs I've ever encountered."
"High drinkability for a DIPA, this went down a lot easier than I expected and while it didn't blow me away, I thought that this was still a very good beer. Bonus points for being so easy to drink."
"Overall, a fairly easy brew to drink. I should have chilled this one a bit more than what it was, since it was in a cooler and sat out on my counter for a few hours. Cooler than room temp, but not quite cold."
"A solid DIPA, however, I would probably seek others out first."
"D: very high, the hops are very nice and even at the slightly higher abv it is pleasant to drink"
"D: This is an enjoyable beer but not one of the better double IPA's i've had recently."
"D/O- Low end of the spectrum of ABV makes this a very quaffable DIPA, if there is such a thing. Nothing that will tear into your palate...very drinkable for the style."
"Pours a very nice clear golden amber with a 1 1/2 finger head thats white. The head stayed for a little but dissipated eventually and left a nice bit of lacing. The nose is of floral hops and citrus notes. As is the taste, except with a decent malt backbone. It has a clean mouthfeel and is pretty drinkable. Overall I see this as a decent double IPa. This is solid, but there are a lot of much better ones out there that arent hard to get. It was still a pleasure trying this beer, however."
"All in all a pretty good beer, but I won't go out of my way to get this one again. Too many great IIPAs around to spend my money on this one unfortunately."
"medium bodied, medium carbed mouthfeel with high drinkability. a very solid DIPA and a lot of bang for the buck, though i'm questioning the age. will be on the lookout to obtain a certified fresh serving and compare."
"Pours clear pale golden with a bubbly white foamy head. Nose is a citrus bomb; grapefruit dominates. Taste is smooth and well balanced. Malts blend well making this full bodied, citrus hops on the sip and through the finish. Medium bodied,easy drinking DIPA. Probably one of the better malt profiles I've tasted. Not as hop forward as I thought."
"Very drinkable for a double given its light nature...you can actually drink this pretty quickly. I was surprised to learn that it was over 8%. A nice change of pace, but the sweetness does hold it back a bit."
"This is the second tasting in a vertical DIPA tasting with the Dogfish Head 90 minute Imperial IPA being before this one. Currently, the DFH IIPA ranks above this one."
"D - I enjoyed this but don't see myself searching it out."
"Premiere Gourmet, good value price for a DIPA. More like a double pale- the bitterness is there but smooth and tame. Orange citrus aroma,and taste of orange citrus and tropical fruit, smooth mouthfeel, a bit creamy. Tangerine orange colour with lots of white lace.Carbonation right there.Had it again 10 months later and it is very nice bitterness."
"D: Smooth drinking is an under-statement."
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a bitter earthy pine hop blast up front that lingers throughout into a bitter yet sweet dry finish. Nicely balanced by sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes as well as by a slight malt backbone and subtle alcohol astringency. The citrus/tropical fruit presence is prominent with lots of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and lemon peel. The malt backbone is faint but provides nice balance with hints of graham cracker and biscuit. The high ABV is decently masked but there is still a bit of alcohol, especially toward the finish."
"Another work of art from southern tier, I know I am going to get burned at the steak for saying this but I think this is the East Coast Pliny. Solid beer when fresh and will be one of my go to's"
"On the low end of medium bodied, lightish amount of carbonation, and very darn drinkable. This is a *very* enjoyable brew!"
"D - very drinkable, you can have more than one before it burns your palate out, but I don't think it'd be a good session beer. I think it would go great with spicy foods so it is worth picking up."
"An impressive beer. However for me it's strength is also it's weakness. The bitterness becomes a bit too much to take after a while. Or maybe I'm just getting old?"
"Not much complexity, just solid pine, but nice nonetheless."
"D - I'd come back for seconds and thirds on this one, and I'd likely be feeling great about it. This is a very nice and light DIPA. Great alternative from my usuals in this style DFH 90min, it's big brother Un*earthly or Heavy Seas Big DIPA. I've been a long time fan of Southern Tier, but I rarely get the small bottle packs. Up until now their regular beers have been unimpressive. Thankful that my sister-in-law brought this over for Christmas."
"D: Good drinkability even though the ABV is rather high."
"Comments: It's a good DIPA for sure. For it's price point it's worth picking up a sixer to intersperse with your other brews on a given evening. Can't see myself drinking more than two or three in a sitting - more because of the taste than anything else."
"D - I enjoyed this brew but the aftertaste and very high carbonation cause me to knock off a few points."
"D- I love this ipa. Crisp and clean with all the things ya look for in a brew. Is it the best in show, no but its up there."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"This is a very good IPA, but I don't know that I would call it a DIPA. Along the lines of Stone IPA or Centennial. I would surely buy this again if the price were right. Recommended."
"It pours a light yellow hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a fast vanishing one finger head and hardly any lacing at all,the smell is abit of pine,some pineapple and citrus,the mouthfeel is very light bodied and averagely carbonated and has tastes of mango,pineapple,lychee,light toffee and finishes with a bitter lemon,pine finish and to be honest id probably would not revisit anytime soon as its not that interesting and not that true to the style i mean its easy enough to drink with its light body but thats it for me."
"This is an amazing Double IPA. It is super well-balanced with a bit of citrus flavor from the hops. The aroma may be the only thing slightly lacking, but it's by no means detrimental to the experience of drinking this beer. There's plenty of bitterness to rate the Double IPA moniker and it's all extremely well-balanced with the malt backbone. I really couldn't say whether this is an IPA dominated by malt or by hops because they both work so well together. No off-flavors of any kind. This is a world class Double IPA."
"The abv was the only prob with drinkability!"
"D-This is not a beer I would try again, I was expecting A lot from southern tier with this beer, it was kind of a let down as far as taste and drinkability."
"D- Definitely doesn't drink like an 8.2% alcohol beer. A very sessionable beer for a Double IPA."
"Simplicity usually doesn't describe this style, but Southern Tier is working with a different interpretation here than most. I can get behind it as a regular."
"Doesn't feel anything like it's size. Ding would cringe, at least, but it goes down easy enough to session. Not sure I want that in my DIPA. But it's and easy drinker that tastes good and is very well balanced. It's not super complex. I'd be happy to have made it, be happy to have it again, but I wouldn't seek it. Unlike other Southern Tier DIPA's, such as Unearthly. But it is priced in a more affordable lot than than the special ones too, so that is another factgor to consider."
"Overall, this is a pretty good DIPA, though it's lacking in a few important departments. Firstly, it really needs to be a more viscous brew, as it both looks and tastes very thin. Secondly, I would prefer it to be a bit more hop-forward in the taste. Despite these, it is still a pretty nice brew and I'm glad I got to try this, the first of (hopefully) many beers by Southern Tier."
"D - This is a great DIPA. It reminds me of of Bell's HopSlam - but it's not THAT great."
"Very nice looking beer here. Crystal clear honey gold color with a puffy white two finger head. This one produces lots of lacing. Aroma is a little lacking for a double ipa, citrusy and tropical fruit hop aromas, light pine aroma. Pretty juicy taste, some pinapple and tropical fruit, nicely bitter with clean finish. Simple malt bill makes for a hop show case. What little malt flavor there is is biscuity. For sure you can't tell this is over 8% well hidden alcohol, really drinkable beer here."
"I said that there may be less of a malt bill for this particular Imperial IPA, given the ABV %, however, this can quickly become quite the malt bomb. I like my DIPAs very fresh, but this seems to fade very quickly. I find freshness is paramount with this beer, and since they don't bottle date, that becomes quite difficult to determine when purchasing by the bottle. Ive had this beer in various stages - when it is fresh, whether on tap or from a bottle, it is a helluva beer (as this review represents)."
"overall, decent beer, disappointed by the taste...i wouldn't get it again but was worth a try, obviously the rest of BA liked it but i did not"
"Drinkability is high. For an Imperial IPA, this beer is refreshing, clean, very very tasty, and while it may be alcoholic, the 8.2% doesn't come through much at all. It's dangerously drinkable."
"The perfect IPA."
"D: This is a very enjoyable beer.Easy to have a few back to back."
"More like a 1.2XIPA. Certainly a more flavourful beer than their regular IPA but not a DIPA in the style I prefer--not enough depth or malt sweetness. But it's a good beer in its own right."
"The beer's aroma is an alluring citrus fruit. The beer has a brilliant white head. The beer is golden straw color; leaves a nice lace down the glass as you drink the beer. This is a very pleasant DIPA which would pass as an IPA."
"This is the first time I have tried this beer and I am so pleased that I have finally tried it. As I have mentioned, it will be a fixture at my home and will be consumed over and over again. I highly recommend this DIPA to all hop heads out there."
"2XIPA appears light orange and mostly clear with an inch of white frothy head that leaves a few spots of lacing. The aroma is of alcohol and hops with hints of citrus fruit. The beer tastes very good, but the alcohol presence is a bit too forward, detracting from the pleasant citrus and hop flavors, slightly decreasing the overall drinkability and enjoyment. Overall, a good beer and worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth going down. Nothing fancy but a solid DIPA. Thanks Mike!"
"D- I've never had a DIPA that drank easier...in other words be careful!"
"D: Fairly drinkable due to its low finishing gravity. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer just like on the label. It's a good beer but it I think to some point drinkability suffers due to a lack of malt character."
"Good beer."
"I would suggest all IPA lovers to try this beer."
"I picked up a bottle of this for a buck fifty on a whim in a deli. Poured into a tumbler it was a hazy yellow body with a fluffy white head. Smells of hops and yeast. Very strong malt profile on this. Velvety feel to this one with good carbonation. Alcohol is barely noticeable. I was wondering what the ABV was on this for a bit. Could be dangerous."
"Nice aroma, but ultimately this brew was a little underwhelming. Easy-drinking enough, though!"
"Mouthfeel is nice and supple with a soft carbonation. In no way a bruising experience, but that's not always a good thing. Southern Tier is not a brewery that I usually reach for and I'm not a huge fan of their beers in general, finding them often gimmicky or lacking in styles I typically enjoy. This double has real potential, but lacks the cohesion and pop I'd like to see."
"Drinks too easy, abv is well hidden & this could just as easily pass for a ballsy IPA. Very nice, will buy more in the future if still around. This would go great with some green chile or Thai red curry"
"Pretty good. It's nothing spectacular but its well done for sure! I'd buy again."
"Southern Tiers flavor profiles aren't quite my favored for IPA styles but that won't prevent me from enjoying their beers!"
"This isn't nearly as strong as any of the other DIPAs I've had flavor wise, but it's still an excellent beer."
"D- This is yet another very atypical IPA from ST. Its light on the palate, fairly clean, herbal, tropical, and bitter. Interesting to experience The different variations but honestly- I prefer the classic grapefruit/pine IPAs."
"Pours deep orange with white head on top. Aroma of hop resin, evergreen trees, and citrus notes. Tastes of citrus, orange rind, hop resin, bitterness rushes through and finishes dry. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. This is a better offering than their IPA but begs the question of why have these beers be so similar? This could be their IPA and scrap the other one. A very good DIPA all in all."
"I'm a fan of big, dark, sticky hop-bombs, and as such Southern Tier's 2XIPA isn't my cup of joe. It pours almost lager-lite, and without much smell other than faint hops. I definitely pick up on the multilple-hop bouquet when I sip it, but this beer is more mellow than in-your-face. It's a nice enough sipper at 8.2 ABV, but not one of my favorite entries to the DIPA genre..."
"It's not hard to down a few of these in one sitting but be forewarned, what others have said on here is true. I had no idea this was strong until I looked on here and saw that this is not even close to being a session beer. Plan on feeilng buzzed long after you finished the bottle and wondering how this could be so potent and so mellow at the same time. Thankfully, I don't have to ask Southern Tier to bottle a beer with those qualities since this is already right here."
"D: The booze is hidden in this beer and nicely balanced. Easy to drink despite the higher ABV."
"highly drinkable for the abv. not wat i was going for at the time but still"
"Beer is a clear golden amber with a light head. Aroma is complex and hoppy. Lots going on here. There are some grapefruit and pine notes, and some malty/bready scents as well. The taste is very nice. It starts off malty with a pleasantly bitter hoppy finish. As with the aroma, the taste is complex and multi-layered. Pine, citrus, bread, and maybe even banana. Mouthfeel is excellent, and it's definitely drinkable. Overall, and excellent beer. It's not the straight-up simple hop bomb like some double IPAs. It's plenty hoppy, but it's complex and well integrated."
"Deceptively easy to drink. Can't taste the alcohol at all, its masked by the spicy hop character. Overall, it smells, tastes and feels pretty similar to a single IPA. Nonetheless, its still a solid brew."
"D- Really liked this beer, another great reccomendation from Hogans in Bangor."
"Drinks: like unfulfilled expectations. I've been extremely impressed with most of the Southern Tier beers I've been able to try. 2XIPA isn't bad by any means; the flavor just doesn't deliver the check the nose was writing."
"This was a good beer. A little more hops and I would be happier. I don't know how """old""" this particular bottle is, but it is good for a regular IPA even though it is a double IPA. If that makes any sense."
" Pretty good drinkability, and overall nice DIPA."
"Has a good mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"D: Despite some deficiencies, this is still a drinkable beer."
"I can understand why some people made pliny comparisons with this beer. Beer pours a tangerine color with a thin finger of dense head that lingers. Nice lacing is left after each sip. Nose is tropical, met with grapefruit and pineapple aromas. Upon drinking, this beer I would qualify as a 'west coast' style dipa. The hops are certainly left to shine as there isn't much sweetness or heavy malt flavors to counter balance the hops. 2XIPA has a dry chewy mouthfeel that lingers in the back corners of my mouth. Very drinkable beer, a dangerous one to boot, as it certainly doesnt taste like the listed 8.2% Highly recommended"
"D- A very nice DIPA, ABV is well hidden, flavor will have you coming back for more."
"D: This is really badly done. Drain pour."
"The feel is crisp, clean, and only a little syrupy... Not much warmth in the end."
"Very drinkable and very reasonably priced, I will be having this one again."
"Pours a clear golden with a lively white bubbly head. The aroma is sweet and super hoppy - citrus and pine. Very grapefruity. The flavor is typical hopbomb - grapefruity and sweet, though there is a strange watery thinness in the middle that is unsatisfying. The bitterness on the end is slight. The mouthfeel is weirdly thin and watery, though there is some sharp stingy bitterness deep in the throat."
"Like Torpedo, its more in the middle between IPAs and the west coast DIPAs. And its in six packs. Not a huge wower, but very good."
"Inch and a half head fades quickly but there is good lacing throughout the life of this beer in my glass. This one is 100% clear and more yellow that you usually see with double IPAs. If I didn't know better, based on looks alone I would think this is a fizzy macro lager. But right away the nose tells me otherwise: hops, for sure, but plenty of fruit- with this I actually get non-citrus- more like tropical/pineapple/mango . OK, so the four types of hops do their part, but let's check on those malts... yep, they hold up with a fantastic touch of chocolate and/or caramel. But those flavors don't overstay their welcome and lead to a manageably bitter finish. No issues with drinkability, as I'm guessing ABV (not listed on the label) is higher than it tastes. This is very well-done and I'll seek it out again and again."
"A finely crafted beer. Would get this again for sure. Certainly satisfies my hoppy craving."
"O: Pretty much average on this one. The flavors won't burn you out quickly, and the low carbonation means it isn't overly filling, but I do foresee the pallet wanting something different after a few."
"Overall- Another hoppy treat. Well-crafted."
"The hop bitterness lingers, but I prefer a little more malt balance in a DIPA. Alcohol not too present. Solid offering."
"Linger: 3"
"Good beer. Well carbonated."
"(Lightly revised after June 2013 revisit)."
"OVERALL: A pretty good DIPA, with lots of citrus and hop forward flavors. Unfortunately the palate didn't really support everything that was going on; a bigger, fuller palate would give the flavors more of a platform to perform on. Other than that, however, this is a solid offering from a solid brewery. One worth checking out."
"D- not too bad, but i could not have more than one or two in an evening, the strength and feel just wouldnt allow it."
"D: Alright for this strong an IPA. The lightness of the drink improves the drinkability."
"Very solid DIPA which drinks more like an IPA. Reminds me a bit of Stone IPA or Two Hearted, though not quite as enjoyable. The characteristics are spot on for the style. A good alternative DIPA when my favorites are not around."
"I would take this over 90 Minute (90 Minute is great, but this is a touch better). Very drinkable, and the high ABV is not an issue at all. You only notice the warmth a little while after drinking it."
"Pours a brilliantly clear, bright golden color. There is a one-finger white head with light retention throughout. Big lemon and grapefruit hop aromas with a substantial danky component. Bitter citrus hops dominate the flavor with lemon and grapefruit notes taking the day. There's not a whole lot else going on here other than the clean citrus bitterness. Finish is quite dry with the alcohol being present but not overwhelming. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation on the palette. The finish is dry and the alcohol warming is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good for the 8%+ abv - the flavors are clean and enjoyable, but the bitterness and lack of complexity limit drinkability somewhat. Well worth picking up a bottle or two."
"Decent but not my favorite of the style."
"Still pretty reasonable for what it is. Not going to rip it as will try again once Australia gets more of fresh stocks of this. Ticks a lot of boxes but nowhere near as good as PTE is."
"This is an excellent, very drinkable IPA that will not disappoint you. Nice kick with the ABV well disguised by the great tastes and finish. Quality is obvious."
"Very tasty and drinkable beer that packs a punch. Nice."
"D- Fairly high, although don't think this one is one I will revisit- easy enough to drink but many other DIPAs I'd reach for before this one. The sweetness got to me by the end of the bottle."
"Cheers!"
"Awesome all around. My local store gets ST stuff super fresh so as soon as i see the 2x i always grab some. Looks awesome, nice pale gold color. Smells terrific lots of hops and citrus. Tastes just as good as it smells. really complex and well rounded IPA. The bitterness is not overpowering in this one at all. Highly drinkable, i could definitely see myself putting away a few of these in one sitting."
"D. Cheers mate lets have another and another."
"Smoothes out nicely as it warms. Like so Many 2IPA's out there, nothing different or amazing, but clearly a good one, I'll have to get a """Big""" bottle next time."
"D - This beer could be thought of as the East Coast's version of Hop Stoopid. Take that FWIW."
"This is a great offering from Souther Tier! Nice bitter hops with plenty of flavor. There isn't anything that really knocks my socks off and nothing that screams DIPA, but other than the alcohol it would be a pretty solid IPA. I wouldn't pass this one down if I had the chance to drink it again, but I probably wouldn't search it out."
"D - This is a very good DIPA; the malt is present in sufficient strength to keep things balanced, but it knows its place and does not stray beyond that role. The hops are bright and pungent and manage to shine throughout the beer, but especially in the aroma. A nice blend of citrus and pine that works well as it becomes somewhat fruitier in the flavor. This is an unusually well made DIPA with a beautiful hop character; the bitterness could be a bit smoother, but that is really the only area that I can find significant room for improvement."
"This perfectly fits my preference for a DIPA....lower malt, lower ABV, let the hops shine. Good stuff! Would love to try a less than a month old sample someday."
"D- The balance of this beer makes it very drinkable. It drinks way better than the Unearthly IPA. ST's higher alcohol beers tend to be very sweet, but this beer hits a great balance at 8%. Beautiful balance of hops and malt."
"A very good IPA. I believe this is what a great IPA should be. There are many craft IPAs that are too far out there for me, but this one is unique, powerful, and solid, yet still nails every characteristic an IPA should possess. It led with a great aroma and has a deep, sustained body with a great flavor that lasts, but doesn't sour as some IPAs do."
"Light toasted grains up front. Cookie dough and fruit malt swell underneath ample hop bitterness. Hops start out resinous, herbal, and sticky. Citrus and pine notes come later, as bitterness swells. Malt becomes doughier and caramalier. Dries out a bit in the finish, though there is some lingering sugary malt. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Very solid DIPA (and a great value)."
"This was a pretty decent DIPA. It had a nice pine and bitter hop taste. It was a decent color and smelled pretty hoppy. The taste was kind of average for a double IPA. It was good, but it didn't really stand out too much. the mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied. These were very drinkable, but if I was in the mood for a double IPA i would probably be looking for something a little more extreme. Still a good brew though."
"Wish I had taken more thorough notes, but basically the 2xIPA was like an extra strong IPA. The hops seemed on par with a DIPA but the malts were lacking in comparison, which I enjoyed but might not be for everyone."
"(Active Review)- What a surpise... Golden in color, no haziness. Big foamy head. Strong smell, big hops and citrus scent with some pine. I am taken back by my first sip with the bitterness, I was not expecting this from a clear gold IPA. There is some honey in it at the end to smooth it out. A smooth and mellow double IPA, not really my cup of tea I like double IPAs that bite you back. Iverall very drinkable and not shabby but there are better ones."
"Drink - A very nice drinkable IPA. Like I said before, I'm not sure I notice much of a difference from the regular IPA version, but it is a solid beer nonetheless. I couldn't notice the increased alcohol at all."
"Taste-Piney hops, tangerine, underlying malt sweetness, orange-rind bittering finish. Nicely balanced and easy drinking for a DIPA. Hardly any alchohol bite to speak of. Tasty."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a very solid head that has excellent retention. The aroma is mostly that of hops, but something about it makes you think 'mellow hops'. The front has a lot of dry, bitter notes, while the finish has a wonderfully smooth, mellow finish. Honey and earthy notes round it out. Overall, pretty toned down for a double IPA but that just means you can drink more of it."
"D- Very sessionable at 8.1% especially for a beer of it's style. Brings a high amount of hops to the table and delivers in that regard, but lacks the malt character that I would expect from a DIPA. All in all, pretty good. I would enjoy having it again."
"D-I'm not sure if I ever even put the pint glass down.This is a truly exceptional beer.I would've guessed an ABV around 6% if I didn't already know otherwise.This beer propelled itself into my top three with the quickness.Hats off to Southern Tier."
"This is drinkable, but the ABV makes it a slow-drinking beer. Goes well with cheddar or a sweet cracker."
"D - Goes down very easy... Not very sessionable at 8.2% and actually packs quite the potent wallop... Tasty and enjoyable, a better than average DIPA that feels like it should have rated a tad bit higher..."
"O - Overall one of my favorite DIPAs, despite the score perhaps not being super high. Taste and drinkability combine to make this exceptional. This is a beer that, if I see it on your draft list, I will absolutely have at least one in the night."
"Drinkabilty - Smooth and easy to drink. Im shocked really this is a double ipa. Ive drank ipa's that had more kick then this. But man its so smooth and tasty. Insane thats its over 8%, i swear its 5-6%, i could pound these, then end up in trouble, be careful, southern tier made a really nice beer that will hurt you if not careful."
"I think this beer meets someone in between a regular IPA and a double, sort of like Torpedo. It feels much like a normal IPA without the sticky bittersweetness of its larger brothers, which is why I believe it is such a pleasure to drink. Definitely worth picking up a six pack of this if you see it."
"D: A fabulous IPA but not quite a double. It lacks that over-the-top quality my favorite DIPA's have. However, categories aside, this is one heck of a hoppy beer and one that I could easily drink over and over again if available. Thanks a lot for this great brew Michael!"
"Drinkability: It's decent, though not as personally rousing as some of their other hop-centric offerings."
"Another solid offering from Southern Tier. It's hard to say whether I like this more than the regular IPA, because they're both great! If you're looking for a bigger beer go with this one, of course."
"Overall a pretty solid representation of the style, but the finish could be a bit smoother. I have 3 bottles left and am looking forward to them!"
"D- It's drinkable, but doesn't contain that piney pungent hop profile like the other double ipa's. It just doesn't stack up."
"D: Decent drinkability. A bit sweeter then expected or desired from a 2x hop ipa. The sweetness factor is perhaps the limiting aspect here more so then the hops."
"The 8.20% ABV is devilishly well-hidden behind the mountains of hops and multitude of fruity tones contained within this beer. Overall, a very fine beer and outstanding east coast double IPA. I could drink these all night."
"D - If there ever was a session DIPA, this would be it. It might be passable as a standard IPA though, but it's great either way you look at it. The smooth, crisp flavors really blend well giving it a nice and balanced finish. It's a great beer."
"Overall impression: A big, bold, American hop forward beer. Easily drinkable with enough hop bitterness and alcohol dryness to make it approachable. Nicely done"
"Flavor is not quite as nice as the smeel, but still solid. The tropical fruit is a bit lighter, with pine kicked up a little bit. Nice light mouthfeel makes it extraordinarily drinkable."
"Overall, its a solid beer. Aside from the ABV though it doesn't feel like a DIPA so you might be disappointed if you're craving something disgustingly bitter. Its still worth a try and I recommend you give it one."
"D: Not sure if this has been sitting on a shelf for a while or not, since I can't find a bottled on date. But in general I am not really impressed with this one."
"T/M: Piny spice spreads out on my tongue. the betterness remains on the tongue even as the alcohol """glow""" recedes. There is a slight biscuit flavor present, hiding behind the hops. Very drinkable, but a little heavy. An excellent Imperial IPA."
"O: Very good selection from Southern Tier. Near the top of what I have had from them to date."
"I'll stick with Unearthly thank you very much. This 2XIPA from Southern Tier, one of my favorite breweries from out East, is nowhere near the top of the list of beers they brew. I did however really enjoy smelling this one. If that counts for anything...?"
"Overall: This is a great beer. One of my favorite DIPA's on hand. I cant say my favorite just because I wish it might have been just a bit more bitter. Even though I gave it a high score, I still was left with a more hoppy profile. After all I did buy a DIPA."
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer has a golden orange color and a white foam head. Within the liquid I can see a a few clumps of bubbles clinging to the sides of my glass, as well as a lot of rising streams of carbonation. After a short while, this tapers off to just a few bubbles making their way upward. The aroma features some warm pine hops and some malt in the back. The flavor has a good hop presence that is better but not excessive. Before the hops kick in, I can taste some pale malts. Hop oils and warm alcohol are on display in the finish and linger on. It's a full bodied beer with plenty of carbonation and bitter flavors to feel on my tongue. There is some coating, but it isn't very sticky. It is very drinkable though, considering the style. I could handle a 12oz bottle or two of this in an evening. I wouldn't want much more than that, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to another pair the next day, after my pallet recovered."
"drink - i really like this beer and keep wanting to go back for more. good job ST"
"D- Easy to drink, but nothing to write home about. The metallic taste turns me off."
"D - Very drinkable and well balanced. good beer"
"Pours a light gold bordering on yellow. Nice white head in the tulip and large amounts of lacing as it makes its way down. Promising start but the nose is a big letdown. With a name like 2XIPA, I'm expecting something big and bold. This brings a bit of citrus and grass, but nothing over the top. Taste is the same, although the bitterness levels are pretty high. Not much malt and very little actual hop flavor apart from the bitterness; not sire what they were going for here. Mouthfeel is dry and slightly alcoholic. Good drinkability as I like me some resin with my lunch, but nothig spectacular."
"3rd in my Southern Tier experience. A nice addition. My first 2 were outstanding (Mokah and Unearthly)."
"Very good beer. I could drink this often."
"very drinkable"
"D- much better than i was expecting and im left asking myself why this isnt distributed around here. cheaper than most six packs and in my opinion a higher quality than several other options. check this one out if you get the chance."
"D - Not the best DIPA, but a nice drinker."
" I remember seeing the threads about """better then pliny...""" If so I will be underwhelmed with pliny if I try it considering all the praise it gets."
"I am absolutely astounded to view the ABV of this beer. completely hidded. I was wondering why they called it a double IPA. I did seem to catch a hefty buzz yesterday so that makes sense now."
"12oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a loose, one inch, sudsy, white head. Nose expresses sweet grapefruit on a malty backbone, with a suggestion of medicinal/earthy hops at the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, not as sweet as initially anticipated, although it offers a fairly nice balance between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a fairly crisp finish. There's also a little oiliness to the texture; however, the carbonation disperses the character a bit. As far as DIPAs go, this one is pretty easy drinking and well-balanced, albeit a bit light for the style, which also serves to enhance the drinkability."
"D - I enjoyed this IIPA from Southern Tier and I'm happy to see they put one in 12 oz. bottles...this is an affordable IIPA that isn't bad to have around"
"D - Very drinkable, with the hops offering a lot of taste with very little harshness on the palate. Nice balance of sweet caramelly malts."
"$11/De Vino's/Six-pack"
"Definitely Southern Tier's interpretation of a west coast style DIPA. It hits that mark, and is quite tasty, however I'm used to drinking fresh west coast DIPAs, and this doesn't quite compare to most of them. It could just be that this bottle is 3 months old, but everything there was nice, the hop flavor just needed to be more vibrant and apparent for me. Nonetheless, very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a yellow copper color with a fluffy head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smell is of citrus notes with grapefuit outdoor fresh smell. Taste is spot on, but a little thin for a DIPA, I can taste a nice strong hop bitterness up front with a thin malt backbone. Very pleasant hop finish with a candy like sweetness toward the backend. Overall another nice offering from STB."
"Anyway, I was glad to see this in a bottle because an 8 percent ipa is actually hard to find and refreshing. Same opinion as above and I was glad to find it."
"smells like it would have you dancing with chipmunks underneath a butterscotch waterfall"
"D: Very nice. Easy to drink and the 8.2% never shows itself. Half way through, I wanted another one."
"Murky golden pour with a nice and creamy white head. Very hoppy aroma. Medium bodied. Resinous hoppy flavor, pine and grapefruit. Spicy finish I wasn't expecting. Lingering hop bitterness. This is a pretty straight foward and tasty IPA. It took me a long time to find this beer but it was worth the wait"
"Copper with a creamy, pitted eggshell head and nice glass coverage. Sweet malt and dank, citric hops in the aroma. Orange peel and grapefruity hops with a spicy herbal quality balanced with rich caramely malt flavors. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. An easy drinker for 8+% ABV. This could be my new go-to IPA."
"Very soild effort from Southern Tier. I enjoy their standard IPA and this is a step above in all respects. Pours a nice golden-copper color. Less orange than many IPA's. Head is a respectable one inch and lasts to the bottom of the glass. The nose is very nice---pine and some tropical fruit. Taste is bold and assertive---crisp, but full bodied. Hops dominate versus malt. This reminds me of a crossover with the best of East and West coast IPA's represented. Carbonation is just right. The finish is dry---as a good IPA should be. Scary that this is 8.2% abv---goes down easy. At $9.99 a 6-pack local---a real bargain. Recommended."
"Overall I was thrilled with the aroma as it was its best feature. Upon taste I was disappointed as the citrus aroma was not that present in the taste"
"D- very fresh very tasty great DIPA solid showing nothing unique but no flaws."
"Semi-cloudy pale yellow brew gives a 1/2""" of bubbly white head that soon settles to thick islands of large bubbles and leaves a respectable amount of white lace on the glass. Smell has a milky creaminess and a little diacetyl (?), but the main event is a fairly robust citrus and pine hop. Taste follows right from the smell. Body of melon, and whipped cream, bit of candi sugar sweetness and vanilla, with a moderate hoppy bite of lemon Pez candy and pine. Mouthfeel is thin and light, carbon a little fizzy but appropriate for giving a crisp feel. Finish is kinda dry with some lingering hop and spicy alcohol."
"It finishes pretty bitter, very bitter, with some astringency, and plenty of juicy hop remnants. More pine, citrus, herbal grass, and fresh musty hop resin help. There is a slight sweetness remaining from the malts, but it dries quite a bit with help from the bitterness."
"D- VERY drinkable offering but one that will catch up to you at 8.20% ABV. EXCELLENT BEER! This is one of the finest beers that I have tried in 2010!"
"I got this from bauermj in recent BIF. It pours honey gold with a sticky little white head. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit on the nose. The taste follows the nose, with a real bitter lingering finish. The beer has a sticky mouth feel and is full/medium in body. A solid overall DIPA."
"drinkable yes."
"This is a nice DIPA, although there is just something about it that doesn't quite jive with my palate in the finish. I'm sticking with the comparison to raw garlic. It's very sharp and not terribly pleasant. It just takes away a bit from the feel and drinkablikty imo. Nevertheless, this is a solid DIPA and I love that it comes in reasonably priced 6 packs. That alone will get me to buy it again."
"D: Goes down easily, bit of a alcohol burn so a decent kick, nice representation of style. I generally prefer the bomber offerings from Southern Tier over the 6 packs, but this is a solid offering that I would get again."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Crisp, clean, refreshing. The honey sweetness and hop bitterness were well-balanced. If this weren't the *only* Southern Tier beer I can't get locally I'd strongly consider this a go-to beer."
"Resiny, dense mouthfeel. Finishes dry and palate coating. Pretty good drinkability although the """chalkiness""" would keep me from having another one at the moment. Easily my favorite IPA from ST."
"D- I got my hand on a fresh bottle and hoping that my review would change my mind but it was just a little bit more hoppy. But it not that much different then my so-call flat bottle. All in all I had single IPA much stronger """meaning the hops""" then this. It is what it is. But this beer is a good beer don't get me wrong and well worth more drinks from me. It just didn't wow me."
"The taste is good, not as big as most DIPAs but still very full and complex. Citrus hops with a bitter herbal edge over a balanced malt base, which does a lot to let the hops shine. Very well crafted and humble malts IMO. The mouth feel is average and a bit thin for something that calls itself a DIPA. Over this is good instead of 2Xipa its really more like 1.5Xipa. Good IPA for the price at least."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Dale's Pale Ale pint glass. A residual thin layer of head is all I got from the pour, but it has lasted a few minutes so I'll give it credit for endurance. Color is a dark urine yellow with sparse fine carbonation bubbles. Aroma is of juicy citrus and pineapple. First taste impressions are that this DIPA is lacking that malt creamy-ness not uncommon in the style. Hops are well balanced, not too bitter and a nice clean flavor. For a 8.2% DIPA this has impressive poundability (8.5/10), almost too good in that department."
"Mouthfeel is relatively medium-bodied with low-leveled carbonation. Drinkability is moderate- not too quick, yet not too slow either."
"Of all the IPAs I've sampled, this is the first one that I'd actually consider revisiting. There's a bitter bite, but one that I can actually tolerate, thanks to the malt balance. Not bad at all."
"D - It's good, but not great. Plenty of options here in San Diego I'd go for. I'm happy to try it, but I'm glad for the alternative I have here."
"12oz bottle with no Date Stamp. Pours a light yellowish orange. Not much head but some lacing. The aroma is of dank hops and pine. This is one refreshing Imperial IPA. The taste is hoppy but not too too bitter. Some citrus and pine also. Man I love this beer. A pretty easy drinking beer for an Imperial."
"At times I think this might be Southern Tier's ode, or attempt, at Pliny the Elder. I do find some similarities between the two. If they can figure out that sharp, sweet, bitter flavor that I find distracting this beer would be super duper top notch. As it stands, for a six pack of double IPA I'm very happy with my purchase."
"O - Well, this is certainly a nice beer. Not sure if I have a shiny new bottle, but I'm definitely having trouble understanding the comparisons to the heavy hitters in the style like Pliny and Hopslam -- it really just isn't in the same league."
"Overall this is a winner from ST and I'm happy to finally find another one of their beers that I really like. I love Unearthly, but I can only drink a small quantity of it. Not so with this beer, these are very enjoyable and can be enjoyed to the point you can continue standing up. Great beer ST, finally a no gimmick beer that is just a solid drinker."
"D - at 8.2% abv it's quite easy to drink."
"Despite everything negative I've said so far, the drinkability is actually pretty high. In fact, I could drink about 450 of these things in one sitting. Clearly, the ABV is another misprint. Unfortunately, because of the cost, I won't even be buying a six pack. I guess I'll have to give this one another try next time I see it on draft."
"This is a winner. One of my favorites so far. Fantastic beer, and almost dethrones Hopslam out of my Number 1 spot."
"Grabbed a single to try of this beer and was impressed. Has the nice combination of sweetness and bitterness that I prefer in DIPAs. Not too bitter, but enough to feel it. Good stuff."
"M - Very good body, good carbonation, a real pleasure to enjoy."
"Notes: This is a very solid, great tasting, well executed beer. My biggest regret: I didn't start drinking this sooner."
"This drinks like a pale ale. Give me more."
"A dual recommendation from VDubb and my man Jeff, another entry in the ongoing Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. It pours a clear orange-ish golden straw topped by a half-finger of quickly-dying white foam. The nose comprises onion, celery, pine resin, ruby red grapefruit juice, a hint of straight alcohol, and a smattering of sweet caramel. Honestly, I'm not too big a fan of this smell. The taste is more about the pine and caramel, though a small hint o' leek makes its way in there too. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a decent DIPA, but the smell is a negative; beyond that, it's not too bad."
"Very nice, paired with sharp cheddar cheese. I only picked up a bottle, i should've picked up 6."
"Poured a slightly hazy copper color with a one finger head, and featured some nice lacing down the glass. Smelled of pine and grass; hops! Taste was not bitter up front, but more citrus and sort of flowery, but the hops bitterness kicked in nicely in the finish. For me, the ideal IPA character of flavors. Nice job here. Mouthfeel was nice, typical of the style, and drinkability was fair to good, as the ABV may kick your behind before you realize it!"
"D - This is a solid DIPA. Nothing too over the top with the hops, however it is still very bold. Very drinkable for a DIPA."
"D - Very drinkable and tasty beer. I like this amped up IPA for a nice price."
"This is a fine dIPA at it's price point for sure and I wouldn't hesitate to grab a six pack to satisfy a hop fix!"
"The drinkability is pretty good. This beer is a bit watery, its not overly bitter or dry which makes it pretty easy to drink. This is an ok IIPA but, the flavor just doesnt pack enough punch for me."
"overall as solid as they get and just really very well done. would have no issue with doing this one again any day."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, although admittedly I shouldn't be as almost all of ST's big beers are top notch. A very good but not quite world class DIPA that's well worth a shot."
"D: not exactly what i was expecting, ive been impressed by southern tier's other offerings except this one. but it make a ok sipper."
"Not bad, but not great either. The hop character seems a bit muted and lacking in brightness. I'm not sure how fresh this is, although if it had a """best by""" date, I missed it. I may get it again if I can verify beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's fresh. Otherwise, I'll probably pass on it again."
"Poured a hazy golden color. Small white head. Light bodied, unusual for a double IPA, not as much hop character as a double IPA. Citrus, light pine. You would never guess this to be almost 8.5 percent. This is a very drinkable beer. Not your typical DOUBLE IPA but still very good."
"This beer is a dream with a huge variety of foods. Starting with appetizers, everything from bruschetta, grilled shrimp, and onion rings to garlic bread are going to be perfect. With your main, the 2XIPA will match and quench roast beef, turkey, pesto based pastas, cheesy dishes, and anything with a hist of spice with absolute ease. Even with dessert, cheesecakes and deep chocolate will be succulent with this earth-quenching IPA. First though, enjoy it alone."
"Though this was a drinkable beer, I thought it was lacking the flavor and aroma for an IPA."
"Solid east coast DIPA, but not amazing overall."
"This is a very tasty brew and one I'd pick up as a regular."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this beer!"
"Worth a try, but not quite the hop explosion I had anticipated. Good stuff, but a bit lower on my DIPA and, for that matter, Southern Tier scale than other representatives of the style and ST's other magnificent bombers."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Cheers"
"D - WOW! A very drinkable 8.2% IIPA. This could be my go-to for this category. I really enjoy this, and I can get it pretty readily. I am loving Southern Tier."
"Taste is really pretty good! It's one of the most well balanced IIPAs I've ever had I think, it's got a very nice hoppiness to it but it's still very malty and rich. A bit of caramel and citrus make for a delightful beer. It's somewhat similar to Gemini but more well balanced I think. Mouthfeel is sharp and full, a good amount of carbonation, quite easy drinking."
"Drink: Beyond drinkable, this is by far the best beer I have had from Southern Tier, very enjoyable, will definitely pick this one up again."
"12oz. bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a slightly hazy gold with two fingers of white head. Fragrant with citrus and piney hops. Also a fair amount of caramel malt in the aroma. Nice malt base with a good amount of hop bitterness. Not overly aggressive with the hops. Plenty of caramel malt to balance. Dry finish from hops, malt lingers a bit. Very drinkable despite the abv."
"D- This is a great offering from Southern Tier. Its a very drinkable double IPA with enough hops to itch the hop-head scratch but that the same time has enough malt to keep things in check. The abv is completely hidden as well which makes this drinkability dangerous."
"pours a rather clear dark yellow color with minimal head and a white ring,some nice lacing... smell is hops ,citrus,pine,grapefruit,grass and malts all present and accounted 4...the taste is the same some nice pungent hops with tropical fruit notes some sweetness in the malts with grass and other citrus fruits..its a good tasting 2ipa..mouth feel is medium it has good flavor and is easy to drink for a 2ipa..this is however a 2nd tier 2ipa so many others better then thid one it is however great to try..i just wont buy it again not a knock for the quality of this brew its just that i have 2 many other better 2ipas to spend my $$ on..try it though"
"Simply put, it's not the worst thing in the world, but I don't like it very much, and I wouldn't buy it again. There is no pizzazz here."
"D:Overall a very well done DIPA. Easy drinkability, extremely tasty, and all around nicely balanced. Another great point about this brew is that you can pick up a 6 pack for around $11, a steal for a real quality brew"
"Overall, very pleased. I would buy a six pack of this in a hot second. Right up my alley."
"Notes: I've been comparing S.T.'s IPA portfolio to DFH's IPA's: 60 Minute = IPA, 90 Min = 2XIPA, 120 Min = UnEarthly. A sticky bitter East Coast IPA. Better than the standard, not as good as UnEarthly."
"D. May be the most quaffable DIPA I've had mainly due to its balance and reasonable ABV. This stuff just seems to disappear within minutes of pouring. I haven't really found a Southern Tier beer that has impressed me until I tried 2XIPA. Well done and something to buy in quantity."
"D - I could drink this all day. This is an amazing beer that seems to have multiple layers of complexity, interesting nose/flavor (stone fruit?!), but everything in perfect balance. This is perhaps one of the finest IPAs I've ever had."
"D: I thought this beer was less sweet then other Imperial IPA's I have had so I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my socks off. I still dig what Southern Tier does though."
"Pours a clean yellow color with orange hints, with a white head. In the aroma, grapefruity citrus hops. In the taste, HOPS, mostly a grapefruity citrus but ending with a pine like hop. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine like hop aftertaste. Nice big hops, mix of grapefruit and pine. Hides the 8%, and quite nice."
"After on about the 50th DIPA, most of these seem to fall into the same old same old, but this is a bit different. It is dominated on the front by the big sweet hop bomb/ honey falovors, but finishes clean and smooth. This has very little after taste that seems to cover the big boozy DIPA's, and just finished clean and smooth. Very drinkable, looking for more."
"Drinkability-Sure, I could knock back a sixer of these; it's on the drinkable side for sure."
"D-Very nice and pleasant for a DIPA. This is one where I'm glad I bought a 6'r and look forward to finishing them off."
"D: Not bad, but would not enter my top 10 of IPA's and DIPAs, thus, I probably won't have this again. If you're looking to get your palate demolished, this one is a sure bet. Just don't expect it to be great."
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is very hoppy with some pine, orange and dank notes. Very inviting. The flavor is mainly pine with some nice caramel malt notes. I also get some grassy and earthy hops and a tad bit of orange citrus as the beer warms. Medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is not the best Double IPA I have ever had, but it is very good and a beer that everyone should try."
"D: This one did not last long in my glass. Highly drinkable and very smooth. Enjoyable but not impressionable."
"12 ounce bottle w/o freshness/bottling info to be ascertained. Pours lighter amber, clear, typical tan head, with staying power quite evident, goes to a tiny bubble film, low sheeting, collar and very fine strands of lace. Nose is nicely hopped up, citric and biting. Tasty DIPA, ample but not overwhelming hop crunch, I'm getting notes of citrus, pine, mint on the hoppy side, and biscuits and smooth malt on the sweat end. Balanced. Not really what I like in a DIPA. Dangerously drinkable. I'd like more aggression out of whoever determined the hop bill on this one. Tasty and obviously quality offering. Well worth trying."
"This beer arrives at my table your standard IPA medium amber color with a very attractive and sticky looking head that leaves excellent lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Pine, grapefruit and just enough malt sweetness to bring out the fruity notes. Exactly what I am looking for in a double. I take a sip and am immediately impressed. Plenty of bitter grapefruit, pine, citrus pith and lemon zest assault my tongue. There is a nice spice character in there as well that really brightens up the flavors. There seems to be a major bitter component going on here, but an ample amount of pale biscuity malt is there to hold it all up. Very balanced, yet still doing a great job of showcasing the hops. Medium bodied with a great, dry finish and ample carbonation. 2X goes down very easily, which is good news because it is not only delicious, but fairly affordable as well."
"d- good drinkability here, a solid dipa offering here from souther tier, i'd drink this again."
"Other - Serve in a tulip or snifter to really enjoy the hops aroma and serve at the temperature you prefer a pale ale or standard IPA (a few degrees cooler than a thicker, heartier 2IPA) for maximum enjoyment."
"I certainly enjoy it. It may be a good introduction to ST's line of imperial IPAs (UnEarthly, Oak-Aged UnEarthly, Gemini) for someone who's never had them. Drink fresh as always for optimum hop flavor/aroma."
"Pours a golden yellow with a white dead. A bit different for a DIPA. Good head retention and lacing. Mostly pine aroma, a bit of tropical citrus as well. Flavor starts off with some big pine and floral hops which quickly defer to some mellower grapefruit and tropical fruit hops. Beer ends with a slight caramel malt and a smoother aftertaste than expected. A bit creamy and drinkable for a DIPA"
"If you dumped a bottle each of Hopslam and Plinny into a snifter, the result would be 2XIPA."
"Drinkability: this beer was extremely quaffable for the style. This beer was refreshing and very tasty. Everyone should try this one."
"A surprisingly balanced offer from Southern Tier. A tasty easy-drinking double ipa."
"Overall: Great beer. Complex and balanced."
"D: Definitely enjoyable for the abv. Will definitely pick up again."
"Very tasty offering from Southern Tier (aren't they all?). I haven't had Unearthly in a while to make a comparison, but as a stand-alone DIPA, this one is worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is a good. For a DIPA, it's very approachable. Definitely a session beer."
"Highly Recommended to all."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice pale and bisquit malt scent along with a wonderful hop nose. The taste is good also. It has a smooth, bitter taste that boasts of pale malts and lots of hops. It's well balanced and easy drinking. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed DIPA. It's not as good as I would have expected, but it's pretty damn good."
"D - Too sweet for sessions, but one bottle went down pretty easily."
"The feel is great from a carbonation perspective, but I don't really get that sticky resinous hoppiness that I am looking for. I would say that 2XIPA is a good beer, though it falls a bit short for the DIPA style"
"D: Being on the lighter side for a DIPA with the low amounts of malt, hops, and bitterness makes this for a very easily drinkable a beer. While there may not be a whole lot of character, it is surely is an easy drinker."
"D- I'll have another please ! Great stuff, very very enjoyable !"
"Lighter abv for a DIPA and light body both lend to a very drinkable beer."
"A nice job from ST. Its not """world class""" but it is a solid DIPA that I will certainly drink again."
"pours a transparent copper yellow with average white fluffy head that recedes at a moderate rate. spare lacing and very lively carbonation. strong fruity citrus grapfruit smell. nose is very fresh and crisp. harsh piney grass taste with bread malt hints. taste wasn't too pleasing following that fantastic smell. light body, average flavor duration, and a moderate bitter finish."
"Pours a light yellow-orange with a nice white head. Fairly light colour for a double IPA. Smells strongly of citrus hops. Taste has lots of bitterness and citrus hop flavour. Some bready malt too, but the hops are the king in the beer. This is a hop bomb for an east coast IPA, which is great. Spot on carbonation. Quite easy to finish this bottle off and I wish I had more than one. I need another trip to Buffalo to buy more!"
"D-8.2% and it drinks like a 5%. Drink a sixer of these and you'll be feeling real nice. Bare minimum alcohol taste. Yessir."
"D - Pretty good drinkability, I would put this somewhere between 7-8% though that could be off due to the hops affecting my palette. I'm really enjoying this beer, would definitely buy it. Tastes a bit like Southern Tier's Unearthly, though I know this isn't it since that is only in 22 oz. bombers."
"D - Very refreshing and an easy drinking brew. Very clean and a great hop filled DIPA."
"D-This is a very very refreshing drinkable beer. Huge hop notes blended well with the sweet malt backbone a very good beer."
"Glad I tried this off the tap than risking a bottle. It's far from my least favorite DIPA (stoudt's DIPA) but it's not in the same league as others. With so many choices in this category I can say Im starting to really notice the lacking ones here and there."
"Mouthfeel was right where it should be and this is one very drinkable(POUNDABLE) brew. Good stuff Maynard!"
"D- It grew on me through the course of a glass, but I don't think I would drink it again. On the weaker side and a surprising amount of malt for a double IPA. I tried Captain Lawrence's Captain's Reserve IPA recently for the first time and the 2xIPA doesn't even hold a candle to the Captain's Reserve which I think is a much better example of a double IPA. A good beer, but not a great double IPA."
"D-No doubt a good beer but not as good as the draft version! Seems to loose a little of the hop zing and the look was dull...but I still liked it!"
"D - Easy drinking, delicious brew. I wish I had picked up more of this when I had the chance. I'm not sure if the style for this is right however. It seems to me to be some where between an IPA and a DIPA but I guess the ABV defines it as a DIPA. None the less this is a great one and worth picking up if you ever see it. I would pick it up for sure if I saw it. Best brew from Southern Tier yet."
"D-this is tasty, hop bomb with a great feel and nice finish. clean and tasty!"
"Overall I like this beer, but I'm not overwhelmed by it. My local shop has a lot of this right now and I would probably go for another 6, but I wouldn't work too hard to find it otherwise."
"I would love to have on tap and look forward to having again."
"D: At 8.2%, The alcohol is well hidden. However, this drinks more like an IPA then a DIPA."
"drinkability is great - the beer is somewhere in between ipa and dipa"
"M- Very dry, crisp and clean. It leaves the palate with barely a trace. Just a little bite of orange zest bitterness."
"D - what can I say, so far my surprise beer of the year, especially considering I'm not a huge fan of Southern Tier's other IPA's...this one drinks like the finest out of the west. cant complain about drinkability as I easily threw down 3 of these at happy hour. wonderful beer. need more."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs and I could drink a lot of it."
"Wow, 2XIPA I think Rogue went with ISquared symbol PA early in the concept of DIPAs, I guess a simple 2XIPA is hoppy but not compared to the exponential version that Rogue claimed. I'm kidding this beer pours a pale golden crystal clear hue, what's going on here. big white head forms thick in my bulbous chalice. Fine even lacing is laced around the edges of the glass. Aroma is a bit onion/garlic inspired for me, a spicy vegetable green character. Yes sugar wraps around that hop character but what does that do for me. Again a nice sweetness but the hop flavors are onion/garlic vegetable tones what the hell is up with this hop fad. This is no OG Unearthly IPA, but it's a beer they're going to put out in 12 ounce bottles. Mouhtfeel is soft carbonated medium bodied sugary estered hops it makes hops taste like dessert too unbalanced especially when you're hops taste like garlic/green onions. WTF, I want a real DIPA from one of the east coast brewers let's see who is willing to deliver."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light and quite pleasant with only a bit of heat off the alcohol. This is a very nice and well balanced IIPA that I hope will become a year around release. This is a great challenger to those who say the best hoppy beers come from the west coast."
"This is an okay attempt, but not one of my more well-likes DIPAs."
"Drinkability: Another nice and piney, slightly complex IPA. Very well mixed in terms of hop combination. Easily the best ST beer you can get in a sixer. Really enjoyed this one and look forward to getting some more."
"Bigger bodied than their regular IPA, and for sure more hoppy. Just not the malt/hop balance-bomb that I like. A nice assaulting beer that I will enjoy however."
"D - An excellent DIPA and one that I will look for again."
"D: I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. This is by far the best beer that Southern Tier puts in a 6pk, and it is leaps and bounds better than their regular IPA. The value is incredible at 8.99 per 6er."
"Hits you with a solid two finger head of cream white, extremely loosely knit and dimpled surface, not much stick to the lacing. Rich golden color, transparent with a faint gauziness, not much going on bubble-wise. Pine and pungent pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus drive the nose, as floral as herbaceous, spreads broadly rather than penetrate, any pepperiness ably met by peach, nectarine scents, overall comes across as too subdued for a DIPA. Medium-bodied, a little more verve here and willingness to """get after it.""" Flowery, the sweet tangerine, pink grapefruit, lime citrus teases out more apricot, peach, pear than in the nose. In spite of this sweetness, and lower grassiness, the carbonation strongly swirls, enough to power it at least through the mid-palate. Manages to turn texturally drier at the finish while also piling on coconut and pine sweetness. Totally inoffensive, yet, just a quaffer."
"One of the few things I miss about living in western NY was a steady supply of ST beers in my fridge.Poured into a nonic a clear full golden with a clingy egg shell colored one finger white head.Aromas seemed to be more malt driven than hop like I expected,caramel and sweetish cooky dough mainly with a noticeable leafy hop presence but its really muted in my opinion.Flavors have a bit mre hop presence but nowhere near what I would have expected,leafy and herbal with a bit of overripe citrus fruit,a full caramel sweetish malt base thruought.Its ok but it lacks some hop character,not quite what I was expecting here."
"Pours a clear golden color with a half finger head which is a little frothy and stays around for a little while. There is a little amount of lacing present. The aroma is strong and bold, big smell of pine, earthy, and citrus hops with resin also in there. There is also a little breadiness present. The taste is of a caramel and bread malt backbone with a nice piney and earthy hop overtone with hints of citrus. The taste is big and chewy, very good, nice bitterness and great balance. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable DIPA. There is a great balance of flavor to keep you interested and the aroma is fantastic. The balance of the bitterness makes it so that you can enjoy beer after beer."
"This is a really good Double IPA, and one of the few Southern Tier brews I'd buy again."
"D - I can't stop. The abv is hidden well and it does not obliterate the tastebuds like some hop bombs do. It makes you want more."
"Pours a nice golden color and smells absolutely wonderful, mango pineapple, booze and a hint of resin. Taste is somewhat mellow in comparison to other virtual bottles of pine sol that make up this category but up front is resin citrus and light caramel with bitterness at the back. Mouthfeel was a bit lacking, not that well carbonated with a slightly oily feel. Drinkability is awesome, the alcohol is hidden so well. Might buy this again, not sure"
"Overall, I'm impressed. This is a great beer from Southern Tier, hoppy copper and clear, one of the best so far this year, and go get one - ya hear?"
"D - Man I need to search my distributors for a case of this stuff. It's affordable, high in ABV without being too overbearing, and is well balanced. One of the best IPA's ever."
"Pours a mostly clear copper color with a head of moderate size, sheets of sticky lacing. Scent is predominately grapefruit with some notes of pine, tangerine, plus earthy and spicy hops. Nutty, toasted bread scents from the malt. Taste is of grapefruit, with the other hop flavors as noted in the scent, a fair bit of alcohol and only moderate bitterness, the backbone is of a toasted bread like malt and is pretty prevalent on the finnish. Medium body, oily without much lingering aftertastes. A decent dIPA that is not as aggressive as many in the style with a somewhat unique toasty malt flavor."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate to slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it has some very nice hoppy flavors to it. I really enjoyed the 6 pack of this I bought and will be buying more. Very welcome addition to ST's 6 pack lineup, and a very solid beer overall."
"D - Very nice attempt at a West Coast DIPA with lots of citrus flavor. I typically feel that Southern Tier's small bottle releases are mediocre to good, but this one was excellent (even though I had it on tap). Good stuff!"
"D: Not terrible, but suffers from a somewhat apparent ABV, and a high level of sweetness mid palate."
"Good in summer heat, I suspect it will be better in fall and spring."
"Pours a darker clear yellow with a head that circles the glass. Nose is citrus and hop pellets, somewhat toned down for a double. Could benefit from some dry hopping. Flavor profile is similar to the pale, with powdery lemon zest, and pine, followed by more citrus flavors like white grapefruit and orange, and finishing with a lasting bitterness. Drinkability is somewhat low here just because the lack of complexity. Just not into it."
"D= Pretty nice IPA. Not as pungent or powerful as Furious but a similar bouquet and taste. Very nice and worth a shot if you don't live in an area with a World Class IPA."
"Drinkability:I was expecting the hops to be more in your face, as many American brewers are doing these days, but instead, southern tier went in for a deeply complex, thoughtful brew. It's one of the more sessionable DIPAs out there, as much as any DIPA can be sessionable."
"D: This beer is amazing. Next to Pumpking this might be my new favorite ST beer. They were just sort of floating around putting out bigger and bigger stuff and this blew me away. A totally different animal than unearthly. Growler is on borrowed time."
"Southern Tier 2XIPA is a dense, crystal clear golden ale with a dense and frothy yellowish white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a sweet, floral aroma with notes of hay and oranges. It smells great. It's pretty full bodied; smooth and foamy in the mouth. The finish is quite clean and dry. It has a nice, bold bitterness of pine resin and juniper. A peppery rumble follows. The aftertaste is long and bitter and gets a little soapy. There's nothing incredibly stand-out here, but it's a big, bold beer with no apparent faults."
"Overall- this might be my go-to-beer from now on. i don't know if it's just my taste buds being destroyed by all the other hoppy beers i love but i found the bitterness to be very low. if you're a hophead i highly suggest to give this one a try."
"D: Very drinkable and easy going but I don't feel I could pound these at a rate some other American Doubles I've tasted."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I could easily session a six pack of these in a sitting, and be regretting it the next morning."
"You know, lately I had been growing weary of Southern Tier and their constant string of """big beer""" releases but this really reaffirmed my belief that when these guys keep it simple and apply themselves to a style, they can really knock it out of the park. This is just an expertly crafted Double IPA and an absolute steal at only $9 for a six-pack. This is definitely the surprise of the summer so far for me."
"With the first taste you get a carbonated hop rush with a citrus. Your Pilate is left with a aftershock of Hops but yet it is extremely smooth and easy to consume."
"Overall, borderline excessive and somewhat two-dimensional but it is still quite tasty for a hop head."
"Drinkability: I think I found a new year round go to DIPA. Very affordable and enjoyable."
"This is a completely well-balanced, expertly-brewed, super-refreshing double IPA that never feels extreme in any direction, be it hops, malt or alcohol level. Another Southern Tier success..."
"D= Until the cows come home and give milk the next morning. I'd love to find this on-tap. If you enjoy a modestly hoppy bitter beer that's well-balanced, you'll love this with most foods. Probably great with chicken, steak, fish, seafood, about everything."
"Pours a clear, golden color. One and one half inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of floral hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, yeast, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and slight spice. Overall, good blend, body, and appearance."
"Poured a golden amber with a one-finger white head which settle to a coating but staying around until I finished this. Lacing was lighter but present throughout as well. Nose was piney hops and citrus. Tasting revealed a well-balanced IPA - citrus (grapefruit, mango) predominated at the start, some sweetness of the malt in the middle, returning to citrus and a touch of dryness in the finish. This was not overly cloying nor sticky. Mouthfeel was light to medium but with healthy carbonation. At a little over 8%, I could do a few of these with no problem this summer."
"It seems like the Southern Tier camp has been a bit quiet lately. Last year they seemed to have a new beer on the shelf every other week. Their new beer, 2XIPA, pours out a gold color, with about a half inch of white heading. The hops come through well enough in the smell, emitting sweet yet bitter complexities. Hops in the taste are smooth and almost sweet. Overall very clean tasting as well, which is unusual for this style. Mouthfeel is about medium, with the hops clearly dominating the malt. Drinking this is pretty damn easy too. I like what ST have done here. This is basically a by the book DIPA that would be a great introduction for people to this style. Nothing too daring, but the overall quality is there."
"A solid beer and something I'll drink again, but there are several others in the style that I prefer."
"Drinkability: This is a very very solid DIPA. perfect match for pizza. dry finish like a nice dry chardonnay, and works well by itself or with food. seek out and enjoy!"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden dark yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, malty, with some nice citrus notes. The taste is hoppy, slightly sweet, malty, nice touch of citrus. Medium body, the finish is bitter/dry. Drinkable, another very tasty brew from ST. It's always a welcome/joy with a ST brew."
"edit: this one has grown on me with its consistency, availability and cost. I raised its drinkability a half point as I have been downing these recently."
"I really liked this DIPA. Not a hop bomb, but still a great brew that I will def. seek out again. I would love to try this on tap."
"Despite being low in alcohol, this does have a noticeable malt presence. Caramel and juicy citrus are quite prominent, with orange, grapefruit and a little stale malt. Surprisingly, alcohol is noticeable too. A touch of cookie dough too? The palate opens with a blend of hops and alcohol, with there being a pronounced piney, moderately grapefruit like bitterness, along with some moderate tangerine flavors. The balance leans towards bittering hops on this one, and that does help balance the simple but noticeable malt character that has sugar and a little dough. However, there still does appear to be a flavor that I can only describe as a stale malt flavor. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer coats the palate with a resiny character. Medium light in body, the carbonation is a touch high but not outrageously so. All told, a solid beer, albeit one that I might not reach for too often."
"Drinkability is good, there is a bit of an alcohol aftertaste that kindof lingers a bit."
"D- really drinkable. The hops don't beat the hell out of your taste buds and make you want to stop drinking. They just keep inviting you for more! This is the best DIPA I've ever had...sure, I haven't had nearly as many as a lot of people, or sampled some of the better ones, but this is AWESOME."
"2xIPA pours a brilliant tangerine in my Duvel tulip. A 2 finger white cap forms, and it isn't going anywhere. When it finally does recede it absolutely coats the side of the glass with lacing, well done Southern Tier. The nose is a total citrus bomb, almost pure grapefruit. The beer's flavor is totally hop dominated, citrus notes make a return, and there's some noticeable pine flavor as well. A bready malt presence is appreciable, but just barely as a backdrop to showcase the hops. The beer's body is unsurprisingly thin given the low residual sweetness, but this doesn't work to the beer's detriment. Carbonation is slightly high to further accent the hops, average for the style. No real alcohol presence, and a relatively clean hop flavor render this brew pretty drinkable."
"Nice drinking mild IIPA, could be dangerous."
"Very flavorful fruit quality enhances drinkability. Hops lack the abrasively bitter aspect of some DIPA's. This is due to the strong biscuit malt backbone that offers balance. High ABV is very well concealed. A rich and flavorful DIPA that maintains subtle undertones. Recommended."
"When I sat down to write this review I didn't know where to begin. Even the brewery's own brewmaster, Phin DeMink, declared this the best beer they've ever brewed. Although Southern Tier has made a great many of my favourite beers - including a bulk of my favourite hoppy pale ales and IPAs, of which there are too many to name because it's literally almost every one they brew - I'm not so sure I care to argue with him on that."
"This is a beer that has a terrific appearance, nice aroma and descent flavor. I thought the body was a little thin for a DIPA, however I could see myself drinking a couple of these without getting hammered."
"I had this brew on tap. A nice deep copper color with a golden head about 2 inches tall. The smell was strong, heavy hops almost even sticky. Very hop forward flavor. More citrus than pine notes. Enough pine though to make it sticky. Very tasty and drinkable."
"Future outlook: Very solid """balanced""" DIPA....I'll be happy to have again."
"D: Not bad for a year round double ipa, and reasonably priced in six packs. Not the most flavorful of dipa's but a quite drinkable and a good deal for the style."
"I was disappointed with this one, it was atypical of Southern Tier."
"Mouthfeel is actually fairly light bodied, not what I was expecting at all. Some good carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but the alcohol in the taste makes it difficult to get down after one or two."
"Poured a dark gold with solid one-finger head that dies slow. Standard DIPA smell of citric and grapefruit and some malty sweetness as well. A medium-bodied beer that is slightly chewey and biscuity and has some caramel sweetness. THe main thing is the hops and there are a boatload as they give off citric and grape and thanks to high carbonation this beer has a real dry backbite that is an easy finish. A very hoppy, very good beer."
"Full and round mouthfeel, satisfying. Very tasty, could drink a bunch of these."
"Southern Tier did a credible job with 2XIPA. It's a solid release. Personally, I believe it plays it a little too safe. It's very balanced and nothing about it leaps out at me. I like it, but don't quite love it. I'd like more hop bitterness. That could probably be accomplished with a little less malt in the mix. A tad less alcohol in flavor wouldn't hurt either. All in all, if you're into balanced, safe DIPAs, this one's for you."
"Clear golden colored brew, small white head. Sticky lace. Speaking of sticky, the nose is all sticky hops. Floral with some pine. Also speaking of sticky: the taste. Icky sticky ickies. A number of different hops are in there in high quantities. Bitter, floral, piney, citrusy. Fairly thin and wet mouth. A bit of spice from the alcohol as it warms a bit. Its one of those hop monsters, and its good"
"D- Damn good though these'll quickly put you on your a**."
"Drinks typical for style. Well balanced for style. I like it a bit more that most of the others on this recent foray."
"D - All kinds of character in this beer. Refreshing and smooth. An easy drinker and a good one to try again."
"D: Very good DIPA. Alcohol catches up to me after one though, so not sure how many I'd drink in one sitting. Super hoppy but well balanced"
"Clear golden body with a thin off white head. Fresh bouquet of hop flowers on the nose. Great blend of pine and citrus. Crisp and refreshing flavor. Active carbonation brings the bright citrus out to the forefront. The caramel malt base is sufficient for the style and sturdy enough to provide a decent backbone. Quite clean overall, including the bitterness. Solid DIPA."
"Light bodied, but smooth. Less carbonation than I expected after the large head it had. Decently drinkable, but the whatever it is in the flavor is a bit off-putting. Glad to try it, I'm usually a pretty big ST fan, but this one misses in my book. I'll have to grab another just to make sure."
"D- This is a great double IPA. Goes down easy and is a very bitter, which I love. At about $11 a six pack it is my new go to double IPA, really hope that Southern Tier keeps brewing this and making it easily available."
"pretty good drinkability, i could session a few of these, but the abv will eventually catch up to you after too many. prolly not as good as unearthly but way more sessionable. reminds me in many ways as their pale ale that recently came out. dont know if ill really seek out again."
"D- This was a easy drinker that I had a hard time putting down. The east coast looks like it is wanting to gain some DIPA justice that the west coast has been seeing for years. This beer is something that should be tried. It just might surprise you!"
"Impression: If Southern Tier doesn't make this a regular in their line up they are foolish. Spread this beer far and wide. Brew it and they will come."
"D- Decent beer. Nothing special, but worth trying, especially if you like fruity beers."
"Tasted from a 12oz bottle. Pours amber orange with a thin white head that quickly recedes to lace. The nose has some malts, but it is mostly just hoppy with a bit of lemon. The hops aroma reminds me of marijuana. The flavors are just as one-dimensional with light malt flavor and strong hops. It is not as bitter as many double IPAs I have had, and I enjoy it for that. On the palate, the body is medium and slightly oily. The carbonation is average, and the finish is medium with hops bitterness. The alcohol is a little out of balance, but other than that this beer is quite nice."
"Not bad, very servicable. Bottle started to foam over after opening. Poured with a nice foamy froth tan head and a bit of lace. Color is a hazy medium amber with a little hazy. Aroma is malty coffee cocoa a bit roast and on the milder side. Ditto flavor; Body is ok ditto carbonation. Finish is good; easy."
"Overall an up and comer."
"D - A tasty brew, not the best in the style by any means, but flavorful and drinkable. Kind of one dimensional in the grand scheme so just above average form me - it could use more hop flavor other than spice to win me over"
"D - I have to say high as i drank this in about 2 minutes and i want another. it was super easy to drink. maybe a bit too easy. very light, refreshing, but too light for me for most nites.. i prefer a bit more body but this is very good and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, spicy, and herbal. This would be the perfect compliment to spicy Chinese, or Thai food. Great deal on a case for his brew! That 8.2% is very wll hidden."
"Notes: so there we have it. Take a Saranac Imperial IPA or a Hop Stoopid and throw in a bit of Sculpin and you've got the idea. I like it."
"This beer resembles Two Hearted in smell, but that's were the comparison ends. Don't get me wrong this is a good beer but for a double I expected more. I think Bells 2hearted is more complex and flavorful and it's just an IPA not a double. This beer does have an awsome creaminess to the mouthfeel. With that being said I will enjoy my sixer while on the patio but next time I'll go with something else for 10.99."
"D - VERY drinkable. You would have no clue of the ABV on this one as there is no trace of the booze it the taste. Great flavors and amazing aroma. Was a bit worried if they could pull off a signature DIPA that stacks up to some of the big boys I've tried but this is nice and very sessionable. Highly Recommended."
"D- Southern Tier was right about this one. This is a fantastic DIPA. The scent and taste create a dominating brew. The brew is very drinkable. I would have to say that the last time I enjoyed a DIPA this much... it was 90 min. Well done Southern Tier!"
"D - Pretty easy drinking for a DIPA. Alcohol is not detectable, even at 8.2%. If a DIPA can be sessionable this is the one. Nice flavors but not as intense as many others - balance is such that you can tell its an imperial and not standard IPA, but still remains very quaffable. Nice entry level, first DIPA for the uninitiated."
"Still not a big fan of the ST DIPA style, but nevertheless, this is definitely a step in the right direction."
"Saw a sixer in the beer case and knew this was coming home with me. Poured a bottle into a 16oz Allagash chalice. Sort of a lighter color than what I'm used to seeing with a DIPA. Looks more golden than orange. It's relatively clear with no haze to speak of. Initial pour left an active, foamy head that settled into a light pool of suds rather quickly. Lots of pine and citrus in the nose. No doubt what style of beer this is from the aroma. Lots of grapefruit. I can tell from the aroma that the wife will like this one (she likes those grapefruity ipa's). Initial tastes packs a nice balance of grassiness and citrus. A noticeable combination of several hops. I can't really taste any alcohol here. A nice bitterness rounds out the taste. It doesn't pack that usual double IPA bite, but it's still quite tasty. One of the lighter DIPA mouthfeels I've experienced. Leaves virtually no stick behind and drinks easy. Quite an enjoyable beer to drink. Go buy some."
"d-Deceptively drinkable. The 8% abv is very well done."
"Southern Tier states that this is the best beer they've ever brewed. Is it? I don't think so (I'd say their oak aged cuvee#1 holds that title), but it's definitely a good IPA. The """It's not IPA, it's not DIPA," waffling is maybe a little silly, but accurate. I can't see this cracking too many """top 5 IPA""" lists, but it satisfies a hophead's need for a fix, and tastes good. It has to be noted that $10 for a 6 pack of this is a great deal; that's cheaper than a 4 pack of 90min IPA, and while the latter is a better beer, it's not that much of a better beer, and 2XIPA may deliver a bit more west coast style hop pleasure to boot. The store I got this from only had 2 6packs. I should have bought them both."
"When I first tried Southern Tier's IPA I thought they couldn't improve on it. Boy was I wrong. Another solid release from ST!"
"Picked up a single from Abe's. The beer appears a clear amber with a short white head. The aroma, frankly, comes off a bit soapy. The hops smell richly of perfume and fruit essence with pine. The flavor pulls in more spicy apricot and orange peel, but it all feels too light for a DIPA. It reminds me of how light ST Pale was, but that beer seemed to be more complex. I appreciate that this is more drinkable, but it could use a hint of malt and more variation in the hops."
"As a DIPA, this beer falls short of Hopslam, Dreadnaught, etc. If you look at it as an IPA it is above average. Nonetheless, it is a nice edition to Southern Tier, especially at $9.99 a sixer. Recommended to anyone that likes a hop delight."
"This was unquestionably one of the best examples of a double IPA I have sampled. Southern Tier has been putting out many excellent releases but, in my opinion, this is definitely their finest to date. If you are a fan of balanced double IPA's, you simply must give this one a try."
"The malt is light colored and thus the nice, understated malt taste (despite the three varieties, per the label). The hops are strong and green from nose, all the way down. Alcohol is not anywhere to be tasted. This is just plain good."
"Overall, I expected this to go head to head with Torpedo. No contest, Torpedo is the better beer. I love Unearthly, I love Southern Tier IPA, but somehow 2X missed the mark. Not worth the extra cash."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for around $2 - what a deal for a DIPA. Uncapped and poured into my standard shaker glass. 2X appears a clear golden yellow color with about a finger or so of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of white grapefruit juice and peel, lemon, resinous pine needles, a bit of sticky weed, some alcohol heat, bread, grass, sweet malt. Medium to full bodied with adequate carbonation and a clean bitter finish. Really drinkable. I had to pace myself to finish this review. Pick it up if ya see it."
"A solid DIPA that rings in under $10/sixer. Two of these would be all I could handle in a row, but a good beer nonetheless."
"The beer tastes really good. Not quite as abrasive and tasty as Pliny or other west coast treats, but then the east coast is about refinement. This is all about flavor, juicy resin and pine needles, tasty stuff. The bitterness in the aftertaste is moderated nicely by the sweet malts, no off flavors at all. Moderate carbonation with a light-like body. Very good as always from Southern Tier."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A nice addition to an already impressive line-up for ST. Not as malty and sweet as Gemini or Unearthly."
"Feel/Drink: Nice crisp mouthfeel, drinkability is right on."
"Southern Tier is calling it, """The best beer we've ever brewed""". While I do like it, I'm not sure if I agree with that statement. Southern Tier brews some really fine stuff and while this one is exceptional, I don't think it surpasses the Gemini or Imperial Hop. I would love to try this one on tap since the bottles tend to kill some of the nuances. (not always, but often)"
"Medium body, adequate carbonation. Alcohol is masked very well as this drinks way too easy. Very well made."
"This is obviously a hop driven beer and I love the finish. It doesn't drink like a 9% beer at all. Another delicious beer from Southern tier."
"D: Citrus and grapefruit flavors that I normally expect in a big IPA were mellowed out somewhat providing a somewhat unique hop profile. Still overall an enjoyable beer -- would pair nicely with a chicken or seafood entree."
"Then there is the price, At $12.80 a six pack (tax included) , I can think of many other offerings worth forking over that kind of dough. Strangely, 2XIPA caused an allergic reaction I did not know I had. It caused me to sneeze without any control."
