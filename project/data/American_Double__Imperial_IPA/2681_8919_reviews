"Great smell and look. Initial taste is pretty hoppy with a small bite. Great beer overall. Also, canned feb 2 2015 so not that fresh. But still good"

"canned a months ago, yet still super oxi"
""
"None of the flavors overwhelm the others but they also don't quite blend together well either.  This offering is drinkable but definitely a mixed bag."

"O-  Wicked nice!  Very good.  Yummy."
""

""

"O-This is an enjoyable beer and one that has held up well through the name change (RIP Gordon) and the transition toward complete hob-bomb IIPAs by the rest of the beer world. My cans were not super fresh when I reviewed, but I actually enjoyed the more malty presence that the older cans provided."
""
""
"really like this.. and would totally drink it on the regular.."
""
""
"On tap at Beechwood BBQ Seal Beach and one of the beers that set the hook for this hobby. Tasted roasty, with caramel, but had good hop bite. Subsequent drinks are not as mind-blowing as the first time (rated above). Still, one of my favorite go-to's when I lived on the East coast and one I continue to enjoy despite CA's bevy of IPA's."
""
"O: Meh. It's somewhat tasty once it warms, but this is a pretty harsh beer. Try Peticolas' Velvet Hammer, it trumps this. This brew is too simple for me."
""
""
""
"Done perfectly. This is a outstanding imperial red. Love the 16oz. cans."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice Red IIPA with a nice focus on hops while remaining balanced. Far too easy to drink at nearly 9%. Definitely worth picking up a 4-pack of pounders"

""
""

"Really tasty. Served to me only slightly cold and really enjoy it"
""

"Overall this is a very, very nice beer. This is not your father's amber or red ale. Of course it is an imperial red ale, so a bit different from the standard variety.  Still, this is very impressive all around.  Very nicely done with flavors, hop balance, and drinkability.  The high alcohol percentage limits the number of this beer one can drink in a sitting, but still this one worth having on hand on a regular basis."

"Well brewed with delicious hop character. Shows that you don't need experimental hops to make an excellent hoppy beer."

"V - Four pack of tall cans, high priced but worth it for the quality."
""
"This is a Fantastic beer!"
""

"Using this as my baseline for amber craft beer excellence!  If you are in Longmont, as I have been to visit relatives, this is a must drink at the Tasty Weasel.  This beer made me join this rating system. It has a nice arching and satisfying taste profile but not an overbearing bitter aftertaste which I do not like!  This has kept me from enjoying many an IPA.  If you like Red's this one will give you a smooth memorable mouth-gasm."
""
""

"very smooth as an imperial IPA should be very strong on the hops. Light enough to enjoy but still has really good substance."

"16 oz can.This is a very nice imperial red ipa.Taste is hoppy with a slight pineapple flavor.Very nice surprise.Oskar brew`s seem to all be pretty good.Nice ABV of 8.7 will get the job done.Give it a try.Kind of a copper color when you pour."

"Fantastic foamy light tan tall head with dark Amber color poured from 16 oz can. Lots of lacing that last forever. Great mouth feel and tons of flavor with very fine finish.  Definitely a beer I will have many times again."

"This beer is amazing. Since having it the first time, I find that I don't enjoy beers I had rated higher as much. I just edited this to make it a 5 instead of a 4.75."

"This beer was less hoppy than I would have imagined. Maybe I was expecting more of an IPA style of beer, but this one had much more sweet maltiness than I would have preferred. The hops are there but they are not all that overwhelming. The color was a nice amber with some brown notes mixed in. Auburn perhaps? I thought this was an above average beer but maybe not worth what I paid for this."

"Overall: Outstanding. With an 8.7% ABV, this beer is no slouch. I wouldn't take this to the beach or tailgating, but for an afternoon/evening on the deck (out of the sun), this is perfect. I'll be back for more."

"Fantastic beer. Pours an amber red with a thick head that lingers. The smell was very subtle but I got bit of sweetness and some citrus. The taste is great with notes of orange peel and lemon as well as caramel from the malt, and a bit of grapefruit pine from the hops. Complex yet with a style behind it. Absolutely would I recommend."
"O 4.00) Very tasty beer. Usually I prefer more overwhelming grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors but for the lack of those it's still great. I'm not a hop know it all but at a guess I think simcoe or amarilla very piney as stated (I'm going to look this up when I'm done and feel like an idiot if I'm wrong:)). Also as stated the taste and feel linger for a good long while making this something that you can take your time with, and with a full pint can you almost have to."

"I love this beer! When I see it on draft, I order it first. I usually only have one, as I like to mix it up when I drink beer. Besides, it is strong and gets me started out right! A big tasting beer, with great amounts of hops and the perfect amount of malt, it excites the taste buds! I like to pair it with any number of fried goods. Boom"

"Taste is sticky malts and smooth but acidic citrus hops, with a touch of pine and some astringent qualities. Nonetheless, this is very very drinkable and well-balanced. Never much noticed the relatively heavy ABV! Good showing from the pretty well impeccable Oskar Blues."

"O: A great double IPA. It is smooth enough to drink at a steady pace and has enough flavor to really give the reviewer the impetus to savor it with care. I think what I like most about this beer is that, unlike so many big, hoppy ales these days, there is both malt and hop character. I could see this one being perfect for someone who really wants an IPA or DIPA, but wants something with some balance and malt heft. Highly recommended for fans of the style."

"Overall: An enjoyable hoppy amber ale. Nice dry hopping and caramel/sweet malts. While it’s quite hoppy and malty, there is good balance between the two, with both complementing the other. Could be an ideal camping beer."

"COD 1/7/14. Pours a clear amber with a dark ruby hue. Massive head with excellent lacing that has an equal level of retention. Nice nose of sweet citrus (mango and orange) with a touch of pine and grapefruit over a rich caramel malt base. Medium bodied with a creamy texture at a normal level of carbonation. The masterful taste profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, flows into a mild bitterness and ends with caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth and leaves you with a sweet lingering mild bitterness and a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat."

"A pleasant surprise. Wonderful sweet fruit notes and big green hop."
""
""
"Pours a clear, deep copper, bordering on amber. The color doesn't really strike me as a red ale, but the lacing and white, foamy head definitely remind me of an IPA. Aroma is full of dank hops with some citrus and sweet mango. Malt comes through beneath, sweet like a cake baking in the oven. Rye bread, bitter, dank hops, some mild spiciness reminiscent of allspice or cumin, and some sweet citrus all hit at once and mingle, finishing with just the bitter citrus like a grapefruit. Feel is quite dry with a light body. The flavor is more substantial than most IPAs due to the malt bill, but it manages to be light and clean despite this. The extra flavor from the malt is welcome and goes well with the selection of hops used in the brew. Probably my favorite from Oskar Blues."
""
""

"I enjoyed this much more after it had aired and warmed a touch. At first blush it's a bit brash but as it settles you learn to enjoy it."

"Overall pretty good beer, nice Red IPA that is easy to drink."
"Starting off with the aroma there is a big citrus/piney hop presence followed by a caramel sweetness. The taste is very similar to the aroma at first, however, as it warms up the malt presence takes over. In the taste there is also a big tropical fruit presence that gives the beer a uniquely fresh and light taste for such a big beer. This is definitely a good beer but there are a few drawbacks for me, which are the sticky/syrupy mouthfeel and the sweetness. It isn't too sweet but I feel less malt could balance this beer out a little more to push it to the next level for me. (84/100)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a great full-flavored red ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a unique amber ale - not easy to finish, as stated earlier, but with smaller portions this is highly doable. Warms you up, and provides a citrus and floral explosion that's really tasty and melds with the sweet, caramel biscuit backbone of this beer. I do wish they'd make a session version of this, somehow - the results could be really great!"

"O: The aroma was fantastic otherwise very good but not great"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good, perhaps not typical of the Red IPA style, which tend be nectary. Nose is a bit better than the flavor."
""
"Overall: Exceptionally well balanced beer that is quite pleasant and completely belies its higher abv. While I could have used a little more oomph, it is hard to argue with what is here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If I were to pick this up and simply start drinking, I would never know this was a double IPA. Then again, it's really a fantastic drink. I absolutely thoroughly enjoy it. My critique is to it's status as an Imperial, but perhaps the best part of it is that it would be approachable for a person ready to attempt their first double IPA. It's not too high in alcohol, and for the amount it does have, you would never know. Very enjoyable, definitely worth a try!"

"This one is a very nice beer although it's not quite hitting the heights of Deviant Dale's. There is a sticky, hop-filled taste of tropical fruits, grapefruit and pine with the caramel sweetness balancing this odd very well."

"Another beer off my check list and pours a hazed orange hue with a smooth creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is straight out piney resinous hops with tropical fruits and honey,the mouthfeel is medium bodied smooth and nicely carbonated with tastes of those piney hops so ever present on smell followed by sticky honey,boiled candy and finished with a tropical fruit soft bitterness and overall I like how sessionable it is for its high ABV and I'd definately drink again cheers."

"1pt Can. Snifter glass. Deep amber color, copper tints to the light. Yellowish froth creates a close head. Crown shows fairly good retention so while slowly dissipates leaves a wide lacing ring on sides. Caramel & toasted malt aromas rounded by hints of figs, grapefruit & toffees. Gentle toasted caramel malt & ripe fruit flavors at first followed by increasing & overwhelming resinous bitterness. Full body.Soft carbonation. Oily texture. Mild toasted malts & ripe fruit come back in the middle. Citric astringency mixed them & provides a bitter/sweet sensation that lingers into a long finish. Resins on the aftertaste. ABV is felt just as a sugary note. Flavorful !!!"
""

"I'm diggin this beer big time! I love Imperial Reds. This is a big beer that deserves big attention. Hoppy when cold, malty when warm. Did I mention 'creamy'?"
""
"A nice tan head on a deep amber brew. Awesome resiny hop aroma. Its fruity, citrusy and smells delicious. Taste has a lot of sweet caramel malt to it, (more than the nose lets on) but the sweetness is cut by the hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavors well. A malty brew but nicely balanced with a generous amount of sweet delicious hops. Overall this thing is pretty damn good, I'm stoked to be sipping on it and I'm glad there are three more chilling in the fridge."

"From can into a Duvel tulip. Pours a lovely amber with a thick off white head. Not as much lacing as I'd expected. First taste is a wonderful, but subdued in hop flavor. I anticipated a HUGE hop flavor from an imperial red, but all around good. Could use a bit more carbonation for my liking. For being 8.7%abv I thought it be more of that """syrup""" feel as I'd come to know. All in all, I'd definitely drink it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This was pretty good. It was really nicely balanced and beautifully crafted. No flavor dominated and all the parts played their role very well. Oskar Blues rarely disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tough time finding this fresh and today I finally find 08/13-would have to do. With about 3 months on this, it is really spectacular. Nice buzz with just one and I'm a lovin' it!"
""
"Final Thoughts: Just not feeling this one, the malt sweetness is just killing the enjoyment. Would I drink it again? Sure, it could taste entirely different fresh and since Oskar Blues dates their cans it will be easier to give G'Knight a second try sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, canned on 8/6/13 the freshest I have seen in years. Pours a beautiful bright reddish orange with a two inch sticky off white head, that coats the glass with lace. Smell is floral hops, tangerine, caramel, hard candy, and fresh cut grass. Taste is all of that, with some grapefruit and pine in addition. Body is large, could use a little more life like all of Oskar Blues beers, a little dry, and easy drinking. This is a very nice imperial Red to me."

"On draft at Brass Tap in Gainesville. Part of my flight. Pours dark copper with small white head, a little cloudy. Aroma of sweet candy malts, grass, earthy hops, mango. Flavor is muddled with grapefruit and toffee, and are a bit harsh on the palate. Hops are faded so not sure how fresh the keg is. Slick mouthfeel. Meh."

"Delivers lots of hops for a red ale, tastes a lot more crisp and cleaner than expected. It goes down easily and is a good summer beer, very likable. I had this on tap, but will try the can some time."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I was not disappointed by this beer. A fantastic amber/IPA hybrid. Works better as an amber but delivers on both. A must try"
""
""
""
"UPDATE 11/22/13: two later cans did not have a detectable metallic/chemical tinge, but the most prominent feature aside from moderate hop bite was how silky/oily slick it felt, ironically like the first Uinta Gubna I had. Still lacking much other taste however so I did not change the ratings except to raise the mouthfeel score."

"Overall, a superbly balanced brew. Like the extra sweet malts that are present since the hops balance it out nicely. A truly world class beer but it is quite expensive. Over $15 for a 4 pack of tall boys."

"O - 4.50 - This is a great beer, once again. This is probably the best can of this I've had. I need to go back to TW and find the four packs that this can came from because apparently 6 weeks is the perfect age for this beer...."
""
""
"O - This will now be a go to beer for me. I've had a number of these red IPAs and I think this now my favorite genre of beer. G'Knight drank cold from the can is a magical thing."

"Oskar Blues has mastered the imperial red style here. An impressive beer all around. Inviting copper-red color and ample white head. Herbs and sweet malt on the nose, followed through with a velvety feel and savory-sweet taste that showcases bittersweet citrus and sugary malt."
"Big white foam head, great retention and sheets of lace over a ruby-amber liquid. Earthy and resin hop, light sweetness and dried apricots on the nose. Taste is candy corn, oranges, ruby red grapefruit, mildly bitter, sweet. Heavy syrupy body carries the complexity of this brew well. Overall this is a complex, heavy bodied, and unique DIPA that's malt forward, but not at all cloying. Enjoyed."

"D: A great DIPA. It's malty and sweet, bordering on Scottish. Well done."

"Balance and complexity build up to an intensely pleasurable DIPA experience. A hop-hammer with a pleasantly complementary maltiness throughout. Ecstasy in a can!"
"Overall: I'm really digging this beer as it has a great taste and is easy drinking. For the style, this is no Nugget Nectar but a really solid year-round offering from Oskar Blues. There's something I love about 16 oz. cans too."

"12oz can. Pours a slightly hazy reddish amber with a large long lasting beige head. Very good head retention and lacing throughout. Aroma and Taste is of earthy floral hops, caramel malt, yeast and fruity esters, a bit of dark fruit and bread notes. Palate is a medium body, smooth with good carbonation. A nice combination of sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity balanced with some earthy floral hops on the ending. Not overly bitter and with a good caramel malt background. Overall a very good, tasty and enjoyable brew. Nice"

"O: These amber/red ales (barring Nugget Nectar) never really do it for me. Having said that, this is a quality brew with a level of drinkability belying its 8.7% strength. Good one, but it's a red...meaning this won't be a regular in my fridge."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good red ale. Good hop flavors with a big caramel malt presence. Its what you would expect from a imperial red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I only really like red ales when they're hoppy and this one gets the job done well. Ironically, I particularly like this one because of the substantial amount of malt to complement."
""
"This walks the line of being to malty-sweet for its style, but they pull it off."

"O: This is a pretty awesome beer! More sweet malt than i would expect, but it sets itself apart from other DIPAs. There really isn't anything i can complain about with this beer! I will definitely pick it up again. Alot of bread and yeast coming through the more i drink. Very enjoyable brew. /88"

"Overall I am going to give this beer props! Number one, this review was from a can and I have no hints of metal in my beer at all. If I was drinking from the can, then yes, I probably would. You know what, a metal flavor to beer is not all that detracting. What is detracting from beer is cheap adjuncts. This beer is a solid 4 out of 5 or better and it ranks up there with many of the Imperial IPA's that I have had and can surely hold it's own. You gotta try it!"

"My first Oskar Blues beer (I have some Ten Fidy's downstairs for another day). Overall the pour was a nice fairly translucent red with a big head. Smell was mostly an alcohol aroma and initial taste was hit with a fairly large burst of alcohol. Tough to pick out any key flavors and left with a dry mouthfeel. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it. I'd probably buy it again"

"O: This is a very enjoyable offering from Oskar Blues. Very tasty, well balanced, super smooth, and packs a decent punch. Nice job!!"
""
""
""
""

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a hoppy Red Ale, I got worried when I got to the aroma since it was very IPA like, but when I got to the taste there was enough Red Ale aspects to balance out the hops and it makes this beer truer to style. This beer had decent drinkability, it went down smooth, and the flavors held my attention, but they didn't really keep me coming back for more, so I think one pint can would enough for me, I don't think I would want two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and how balanced it was when it came to the taste, both of those aspects were pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the lower amount of carbonation, I think a little more carbonation would make for a pretty good mouthfeel. I don't know if I would buy this beer again, I for sure wouldn't rule it out if I was in the mood for a hoppy Red Ale, but I don't think I would seek it out. I recommend trying it if your a fan of hoppy Red Ales, it's good for what it is. All in All this was a pretty decent beer, I didn't love it, but I sure didn't hate, but I still think Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale is my favorite of the style. This was a pretty Solid beer from Oskar Blues, but I have yet to find one that I really like, maybe that beer is right around the corner, who knows, but for now I'm still on the fence about this brewery,"
""

""
""
"Overall: This could be my favorite Oskar Blues offering. Dale’s Pale is a great pale ale with a refreshing hop kick, Mama’s Little Yella is a must-try for anybody that’s a Bud Light only person (since it has a pretty light, but solid flavor), Deviant Dale’s is a huge, burning, whale of an IPA... but G’Knight is just better, despite how good all of those beers are. Super tasty, refreshing, gets the job done... must try."
""
""
"Had this beer from a 16oz can to glass. Beautiful amber color with a thick one inch head, which slowly dissipates to a light foam. Tastes is great, full feel of hops. Mouth feel is great, tb complexion of flavors flow very well. Overall great delicious beer!"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Really good stuff from Oskar Blues, I have enjoyed this one every time. If you get Oskar Blues in your area, you should be able to find this one. Can be a bit on the expensive side, at ~$14 per 4-pack, but in my mind, it's definitely worth a try. Would recommend picking this one up."

"Overall - Well balanced Imperial. Great flavor, great body. With so many breweries making their """imperial red""" ales, the time has come to define the Imperial Red category."

"O - A delicious, satisfying, and unique IPA. Drinkability, a standout tropical flavor and aroma profile, and a reasonable price per 4-pack, this definitely wins among double IPAs for me personally. I'll be visiting G'Knight again."
""
""
"O – Would not know that this was an imperial if tasted blindly. It is very well balanced, the hops are nice and crisp, but not in your face. The malts are sweet and sticky, but again, are not in your face. Unique beer here, it is really a hopped up, malty red ale, it's great."

"Overall - A good beer, a great canned beer. I realize in retrospect it wasn't fair to drink this after drinking the Lagunitas Sucks IPA, which in my humble opinion is a brilliant and beautifully made IPA. G'Knight Imperial Red is very good, I just wish it had more of an amber balance and slightly heavier body."
"Serving type- 16oz can poured into a pint glass. Thanks for reading."

"A saccharine brew; an imbalanced amount of molasses flavor out-muscles what little piney hops and malt it has to offer. Too sweet, too sticky. Hides its Abv well but unfortunately at the cost of its taste. I would have liked a bolder, drier more robust brew for an imperial IPA. A good effort, but an awkward compromise with a sweet sticky red ale."

"The colour was hardly red. It looked like a typical amber, with a fluffy amber-style head. The smell was simply awful. Like a full lawnmower bag that sucked up too many pine needles. The taste had way too much of that smell in it. It tastes like grass growing out of an evergreen tree, with sap dripping all over it. It was icky. If there were any malty, or toasted qualities that make a red ale so delicious, they were completely and utterly masked by this abysmal flavour. I seriously can't taste a damn thing under that over-hopped madness."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, developed a nice creamy head which lasted and laced well. Appearance was a clear reddish amber hue with a nice hoppy, flowery aroma. Tast was hoppy and somewhat bitter with hints of caramel and citris. Mouthfeel was bubbly with the aftertase being dry and bitter, in a good way."

"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 10/16/2012(G’iant G’Knight slogan). Pours fairly clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, floral, pine, orange rind, caramel, bread, light pineapple, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice hop complexity and malt balance. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, orange rind, floral, pine, toast, grass, pineapple, and herbal spiciness. Moderate pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, caramel, toast, floral, pineapple, and herbal spiciness on the finish. Fantastic hop complexity and balance; with a great balance of malts that still puts the hops out front; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red ale! Great hop complexity and malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Plenty of pine in the nose and some citrus, with heavy malt presence as well as you would expect from the styles. This is a very solid DIPA, which is was available close to home, cool story behind the name as well, look it up. Cheers."
"The beer appeared a clear orange with reddish tint with a nice, thick, compact white head that was very well retained with nice lacing and a thin cap after the head settled. The beer gave off a nice robust citrus and pine hop aroma. The taste followed the nose very well, but I did not find it to be overly bitter and there was some malty sweetness in the end. The beer had a moderate feel, sticky, slightly cream, but also slightly oily too, good carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, an excellent beer."
"O: Very glad to finally have Oskar Blues in Ohio. This is a very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall / Drinkability: Not the most amazing DIPA I've ever had, but probably one of the most balanced I've ever had. Very balanced and not a bitter hop bomb....and yet I think I wouldn't mind more hop flavor. Quite drinkable and good with food, but also good for drinking by itself. This is the 2nd of the 4 pack I'm having, the first was with dinner and the 2nd is by itself and I can see this beer complements both types of events."

"O - An awesome imperial red. One of my favorite styles, and one of the best brews I have ever had."
""
""
"I'm starting to appreciate that canned beer can be good."
""
"Interesting brew. The malt backbone is substantial and boozy, and the hop character spans a wide spectrum. Bitterness is not over the top. More herbal flavor than expected from the aroma."
""
""
"This is right in my wheelhouse. I don't favor really dry IPA's so much as the rich and malty ones, and this one meets that criteria. Today was my first, but highly unlikely it will be my last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- one of my all-time favorite beers... great flavors, very well balanced, great value and enough booze to pack some punch. "
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that seems to be a very tasty but typical Imperial Red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, the aroma is amazing, and was a slight let down with first taste. I was expecting a citric bomb, were this is more fruity and malty bold. Balanced well, easy to drink and tastes great. Too expensive, but worth a occassional treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall another tasty beer by Oskar Blues. I can see this as an imperial red ale with some real hoppy notes. Give it a little more overall as I feel this is a lil better than a 4 for taste."
""
""
""
"Canned on 8/29/12, poured into a perfect pint glass. Thick and foamy off-white head towers about three fingers, decent retention on the head and some cling as it recedes. I'm left with a foamy floating island on the surface. Dark orange and ruby in color, hazy, with hints of amber. Holds light well despite some cloudiness. Bright and sweet citrus (grapefruit and tangerine?) aromas are most noticeable, with malt present as well. Can also pick up that bready smell I sometimes get with these Red's. Flavors are well-balanced without too much bitterness, and the right amount of sweet citrus hops, but could be too sweet for some, perhaps. Moutfeel is smooth, very nice, very light carbonation. Overall I enjoy this beer, and will like to compare it to other Imperial Red's in the future. Would also love to get this fresh. Cheers."

"I thought I had this bad boy back in my NoVa days, but apparently I was wrong... This stuff pours a clear brass-amber topped by a stolid finger of light cream foam. The nose comprises toasted toffee, pine needles, and orange rind. Things are kinda muted thanks to the nitro tap, but some elements shine through anyway, stalwarts. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the pine character is more sap-y (not sappy) than needle-y. The body is a light medium, with a steady nitrogenation and a subsequently velvety feel. Overall, a solid hoppy red. Though nothing to get outright excited about, it's definitely something to try if you haven't yet done so."

"Overall this smells amazing, the taste lets you know your drinking a high abv beer but it work well. I would buy this again and sip on it like a spirit."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium-thin for the style, and pretty slick. I think a bit more perceptible carbonation would help to break up the malt. Overall this is pretty nice for a big hoppy red. Nothing amazing, but very solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice Imperial Red Ale. Maybe not the most interesting, but it's a good example of the style."
""
"An odd DIPA. Oskar Blues calls it an Imperial Red, it is a DIPA here. Seemes to be between the two. Not memorable as a DIPA but interesting as a big red."
""
""
""
""
"If you see it, grab it. Drink it and enjoy. It has a punch and it doesn't hide it."
""
"Oskar Blues just came to Ohio, though this is not in the line up of what's being sold here. I hope that this brew joins the line up, because it is phenomenal. Smooth malt with a peppery hop, each balancing nicely for a super-tasting brew. Highly recommend!,"
""
"I don't know if this beer would appeal to hopheads, but it certainly will to anyone who enjoys beautifully well-crafted beers. It reminds me of the classic, hoppy, American Strong Ales (like the ``Bastard'' beers from Stone). G'Knight is a wonderful beer that I will likely drink again only occasionally simply because there are so many other wonderful beers out there that I've never had. What a remarkable time we live in!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow - what a beer! The spicy, fruity hop notes envelop the tongue in a blanket of tingly deliciousness. The malt character is solid but plays second fiddle to the hops. Considering it's strength the alcohol is well hidden. A hoppy smorgasbord of flavour; I love it. This is the sort of IPA you can't find too easily in the UK - well worth sampling if you have the chance. Buenos G'Noches!"
""
""
""
"O: The is a tasty beer. Not overly bitter for the style or cloyingly sweet. Well made and definitely a staple in the red/amber ipa category of my fridge."
"Pours an orange-red color with medium white head. Piney/resiny aroma with a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth for this style as the hops play with a honey-like sweetness sip after sip after sip. This is a really solid brew and for the strength it's crazy easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter body than expected, but not light. Carbonation is soft, imparts creaminess. Nice. Hoppy nose is not followed by intense bitterness: restrained for a double ipa; appropriate, I'd think, for an """imperial red.""" They claim it is a hybrid of the two. Resinous finish keeps bitterness around for a while and intensifies with warmth. Some vegetal/green flavors. Solid malt character balances with moderate sweetness, but I think I would appreciate a deeper, slightly darker malt backbone for this beer."
""
"O - Really good, closer to an Imperial """light""" red for me. Not a true Imp IPA, but man all so Good!"
""
"O - Dank, dark, and hoppy."
""
""
"Pours amber with heavy ruby red accents and a two finger off-white pillowy head. Good retention and abundant lacing as the head recedes. Huge citrusy hop aroma on the nose. Grapefruit and pineapple accents intially joined by caramel, that finishes with a resiny grapefruit rind bitter bite. Medium-bodied with a significant malt bill, sticky with a touch of syrup, smooth and silky. Without a doubt, one of the best imperial reds I've had to date."
""
""
"Drinks best with C'mon C'mon by the Von Bondies."
""
""
""
"O – Whether you want to call it an amber ale or a DIPA, this is a really nice beer. Great all the way across the board. It has a solid dose of hops but enough malt to back it up and to make it possible to call this an amber ale. Another example of terrific beer in a can from Oskar Blues."
""
"Overall, a nice beer I always enjoy. The visuals are spectacular on this one. I'm always confused what to call this. I think the DIPA listing Oskar Blues calls it is a stretch. I'm going with hoppy Imperial Amber, whether it fits or not :). Anyway, its always easy to drink with enough hops to keep me intersted without going overboard."

"O: I hadn't had this beer for a while, but I won't let it escape me for long in the future. It brings a big dose of caramel sweetness, graham cracker maltiness, and American-style hopping to provide a huge punch in the tastebuds. Gordon, you were gone but won't be forgotten. People should forget Deviant Dales and head back to the side of Gordon."

"Pours a reddish, orange color with a foamy, off-white head. Scents is rich with malts and a decent amount of bitter hops. Taste is bold and full of flavor. You get hit with a blend of malts and hops that make the taste buds go crazy. The overall taste and texture of the beer is fantastic. Finishes with a caramel, malty, hoppy after taste."
""
"O: I enjoy it. Overall it is a sweet beer, fruity on the nose and malty in the flavor."

"O: I had this at Red Derby in DC a while back and thought it was AWESOME but now that I'm giving it some serious thought, I lionize it less. It's a really good red strong ale, but it's leaving something to be desired in the taste. It kind of ends up tasting like a piny east coast run of the mill IPA. I'll give it a good score because it's good...it's just kind of on par with decent to really good east coast IPAs which it's not labeled as."
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy to heavy bodied, expected for an “imperial” style, with mid-level carbonation that manages to propel this along the palate very nicely. Finish is dry and slightly sticky along the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy straw orangey yellow with some nice hints of pink and amber. There is a nice finger width head of off-white cream that dissipates rather quickly and leaves a thin ring of lacing to drizzle down the glass. This beer smells big with a resin-pine kick and some nice slight caramel malt backing when poured out of the can. In the can the thing smells like an oozing pinecone, which is awesome! Though the malt subtly is lost with such an overpowering smell, I am really not complaining. The can makes it smell great. The can also makes it taste tart and piney with some medicinal bitters wavering in the back of the mouth that really turn down the flavor for me. The caramel malts are also quite present, giving the pine flavoring a sweet tang with an oh-so-slight touch of bread beneath the weird hops. Taste is pretty much the same in the glass, just with a subdued pine flavoring, much like the smell. I’m not as wild about the taste as I was about the smell. The beer is very smooth and clear as it strikes the tongue, and the smoothness completely kicks the traditional red bite out of the mouth, though a ghost of it remains. The tongue is left tingling and dry with a resinous ichor of saliva coating the tongue. Overall this is an excellent smelling beer that just doesn’t deliver with the taste. Perhaps its five month age gave it the weird medicinal flavor, or maybe it is just too piney but something is not working in the taste. The malt and hop balance reminds me of the Deviant Dale’s India Pale Ale, which is a superb IPA, but this beer just doesn’t stand up to it."

"Most of this brewers offerings are pricey, but I never regret the expenditure after having them."

"O: had this later in the same day as their Gubna IPA, and in many ways this was like the darker, lighter-bodied sibling - the site calls G'Knight a DIPA but the can says it's a red ale - it shares characteristics of both, and I'm not sure how to evaluate it in a style-sepcific way, but I would say it is a good, but not great beer - different but no better or worse than Gubna was as an DIPA. I feel like if we could swap a few characteristics back and forth between the two ales, we'd have a great DIPA and a great red ale, but instead we have two somewhat muddled brews. Worth the buy, but not exceptional."

"Notes: I liked this, but I didn't quite see this as a DIPA, more of a hoppy Imperial Red, or hints of an English Barleywine. Overall it was quite enjoyable. Plenty of caramel/butterscotch malt and a good hoppy kick. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall – A delicious and very enjoyable red IPA. It has flavor, aroma and feel in a very balanced manner. A wonderful brew and definitely one to try."

"Unfortunately I had a old canned date. A year old. A friend picked this up in buffalo, but didn't know about the canned dates. So this rating will be possibly unjust. It poured a very hazy, dark red. Tastes mildly bitter with pretty much no hop bite left. Drinks down smooth considering, and its still better then most Ontario beers I can find. Would love to try this one fresh."

"Pours deep cloudy orange-red in body with off-white head that foams and stays. Wonderful aroma of toasted bread, cinnamon, hop spice, caramel, nuttiness, hazlenut, toffee, faint pine. Flavors of citrus, pine, hazlenut, caramel, toffee, breadiness, slightly boozy, malt sweetness lingers on the palate. Thick mouthful with medium carbonation. Big and tasty."
"Pours a slightly hazy reddish brown color with a decent cap of firm white head that laces the glass nicely. Fresh aroma of citrus and pine hops, with some bready malts also noticeable. Nice play of flavors between caramel malts and brown sugar, piney hops and citrus zest, with a bit of fresh grassiness for a dry finish. Medium body, a bit chewy. On the stronger side of things, but still good for a robust session."
"Rarely your taste get treated those great, but fortunately I have, and hope you should too...Salud!'"

"O - Though this is only the 2nd representation of this style I've had (other being NN), it is extremely good. Nugget Nectar edges it out slightly on being a little less hop forward (somehow NN makes this desirable) and leaving you wanting more and more with every sip. But a solid solid beer from Oskar Blues"

"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. It is a solid rendition and brings a lot of hoppiness, while not forgetting the malts. Additionally, my wife loves it too, which is just a bonus."

"More amber than orange color presents in this IPA. One finger of sticky froth leaves some small loops of lacing and has a fairly decent retention time. The nose is full of intense mandarin oranges and apricot aroma, while the flavor is also malty enough to stand up to the hops and than some. I tasted some toasted malt, bits of salt water taffy, creamy caramel, and even shades of biscuit dough in there, although no real yeastiness, per se... finish is a long resonance of resin and juicy citrus hand in hand for the entire fade-out. The texture is perhaps a wee bit clingy but honesty that particular detail is nothing but a nitpick in the face of all of the things that have been done well with this brew."

"On-tap at the source - The Tasty Weasel Taproom. Deep red, thick, sticky. Resiny hops. Explosive, almost abrasive. Big slather of caramel. Dank, herbal hops. Bitter. An American craft beer classic and one of the best beers in Colorado (that's really saying something). One of the original Imperial Reds. Long live Gordon."

"My first craft beer in a can and it ruled. Won't hate on cans anymore. I would love to tackle a four pack of this stuff on a party night."
"Oskar Blues describes this as an Imperial Red/Double IPA, and I think this is actually a pretty accurate description... This is somewhere between an imperial red ale and a DIPA. As a result, I'm not really sure how to rate this. It's a bit off as a red ale, and it's bit strange for a DIPA. Regardless, it's good."

"O - This beer really impressed me. Nice interplay between sweet bready malt and bitter citrus hops. Great flavor and drinkability. Thanks Oskar Blues."

"not usually my style, but i loked thie one a lot. amber in color, with a tall white head. smells quite hoppy, cakey but not too sweet, and like a dry irish red. its anything but a dry irish red, despite the nose though. it tastes fairly sweet and downright potent. the alcohol reaches almost rubbing alcohol status as it warms, but it doesnt detract somehow. okenty of good malt body and hop bitterness to close it out. feel is great for a beer this big, solid body and bright carbonation make it dangerously drinkable. another excellent beer from oskar blues!"

"Pours a dark amber with a two thumbs width khaki, foamy head. Decent lacing. A nice sweet and hoppy aroma of tropical fruit and pine. A great aroma that does not carry over into the flavor. Gummy, some fruit, some pine, and too much alcohol for the style. A little chewy, medium body with some carbonation. I had tried this at their taproom a couple years ago and wasn't a huge fan at the time, but my tastes in beer styles has since changed and i wanted to give this one another shot. Aroma had me salivating but the flavor proved disappointing. Just saw the canning date and its only a month old so age shouldn't be the issue here, just not a beer I enjoyed."
""
""
"O- Good beer. Nothing really stands out for me though."
"M: I expected a little more than the malt-centric flavors. The hops are barely evident and aren't anywhere near double-hopping status."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange-red amber. Nice two finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of piney hops and sweet tropical fruit, especially pineapple. Flavor follows, sweet malt and tropical and stone fruit. Finishes somewhat abruptly with a slight hop kick. Medium bodied with slight creaminess. An intersting take on a red ale; sweeter and richer in fruit flavors and dialed back on the hops. Enjoyable."

"Oskar Blues G’Knight Imperial Red Ale: Outstanding! Give it a pour and you will find a luscious caramel colored body with a hint of red if held up to the light of day. The head is thin, but lasts well. Definitely linger over the aroma, it is a wonderful bouquet of citrus, flowery notes and wet grass. Very smooth going down, the G’Knight has nice malts swimming around there somewhere, but always overlain great hoppy overtones. Never rough or bitter as some big IPA’s can be, the G’Knight is a fantastic effort in brewing and a great experience to behold."
"Overall: I expected something a bit bigger and flavorful, but this is still an above average Red. Try Lagunitas Imperial Red for a better representation and delicious option."

"I was not prepared for how great this is. For a 70 IBU brew, I expected more of an IPA style but the hops are well matched with the malts and the balance and complexity of this is off the chart. ABV is so well hidden that you gotta watch yourself. A slight, very slight warming at the back of the throat is all that hints at 8%+. Full bodied with an almost creamy texture, the effervescence just keeping it from being cloying. This is almost liquid velvet sliding through your mouth."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some very nice herbal and peppery hop aromas. There is also a pineapple aroma I am getting as the beer warms up. Taste is of sweet malt balanced with herbal, peppery, and citrus zest hops. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light carbonation with a medium bodied and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA but I am enjoying the aromas more than the flavors."

" A nice sipper on a cool Texas evening."

"Throws down a nice, flavorific flowchart taking you all the way from sweet, tropical hop flavors to a toffee, caramely-biscuit middle and a sharp bite of resin on the back end. Very nice, this is a good beer whether it be called Gordon or G'Knight. Always worth the price of admission when you can find it fresh. Praise the Lord for canned on dates!!"

"Recommended."
"Overall, this is a very interesting and impressive beer. Not quite a DIPA and definitely not a red. This is another fine offering from Oskar Blues."

""
"O: I warmed up to this as I plowed through it but I have to admit that I just wanted to get through it and on to my next beer. It wasn’t bad, but I’m not sure it’s Beers of Fame worthy. Unbalanced in favor of malt, slight veggie taste and rocket fuel finish makes it only “okay” in my book."

"Pours a hearty amber color with an off-white head that stands one finger tall after the pour. Retention is good, there are nice circles of white lacing in my glass. Smell is of alcohol, tropical fruit, and malt sweetness. Taste starts with a bitterness, then I get some thick caramel malt, some bready malt, citrus and tropical bitterness. Mouthfeel is relatively thick, but appropriate for the style. Carbonation isn't assertive but it is present: it helps lift he body of the beer to just the right degree. Overall this is a good beer. It stacks up really well against other imperial/double red/amber ales. Definitely one of the more impressive of this style. The only drawback is the rather high ABV."

"O - Very good beer. It drinks more like the """Imperial Red""" it advertises on the can than a double IPA in my opinion. It is sweeter than it is hoppy, but I think it definitely works. Admittedly, I usually drink this one straight from the can, and I think I actually enjoy it more that way (although that may not be a popular opinion). G'Knight is one I pick up when I see it, although I wish I could find more of it in my area. It is a little bit different than most other DIPA's I have had, and I like that."

"Appearance has a hazy reddish amber color supporting a light head thats dissipating leaving nice lace. Smell of big malt sweet fruitiness with alchohol. Taste has sweet malt, fruit with just enough hop to balance having a little alchohol flavor in the background. Mouthfeel is a nice bodied medium with good carbonation. A very nice Imperial red that focuses on the malt and fruit of this style."

"Overall this is a solid """imperial red ale"""/DIPA. Not the best, but a selection worth seeking out."
"The beer pours a astonishingly clear amber-red with an off-white rocky head that dissipates slowly, and leaves a sticky lace. Sweet citrus and resiny aromas jump out of the glass and are quickly followed by some caramel and malt notes. Big hop flavors are quite present out front, with grapefruit, orange and lemon all intermingling in front of a caramel flavored malt backbone. Smooth, medium body is presented with a lower level amount of carbonation. Amazingly smooth, amazingly GREAT!"

"3 finger frothy head with lots of lacing on a murky amber with gold hues body. Very nice caramel malt and hop rich aroma. Some citrus notes. Flavor is excellent with one of the nicest citrus finishes of any IPA I have tried. It is mellow but a little more boozy than I was expecting for an 8.7 ABV. The hops character is complex and can be detected throughout the experience. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This is very drinkable, fruity and hop-rich beer with one of the best finishes in a beer I have experiences."

"G'Knght pours a nice amber red color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is pretty sweet, with hops and caramel really out in front of anything else. Some grapefruit and lemon in there, but in the background. Almost too sweet on the nose. This is an interesting Double IPA... It's very sweet, with a lot of caramel and a hint of chocolate in the taste. The hops are there too, but aren't out in front. All in all a unique brew to me. Feel is medium, with a malt/hop battle on the back end. Nothing spectacular in this category. Overall, I feel if the hops were more out in front, and they toned the caramel back just a tad... the scores would go up. Still, this is a good brew. Cheers."

"I love the idea of a 12oz double in a can. Poured cloudy opaque copper. Started to pour and got zero head, so I aggressively finish the pour to help it along. It foamed up about a finger of off white big bubble, air pocket mess than quickly disappeared leaving a small amount of lace on the glass. Smell is biscuity with some cinnamon and ripe fruit. Alcohol present right away in taste. I am getting some rum raisin bread, pretty heavy on the malt. Spicy notes and some more dried fruits. The hops are weak for the style. Piney hops try to cut the dense malts but don't quite make it to the finish. The feel is chewy and sticky with a nice coating of flavor on the tongue. The best part of the beer for me. In the end I am left with an orange, spice, alcohol twang. The lack of head really hurts this beer. The nose could be better and the flavors more pronounced. This one lacks the hops presence that I look for in the style. Overall just OK, probably won't seek it out again."

"Found at """Plan B""" in mIlford, Connecticut this DIPA shows a pretty reddish amber color along with a modest off-white head and tremendous sheets of lacing. The aroma is caramel booze with a slight grass hop. The taste brings a malty caramel-toffee with mild vanilla and herbal hop ideas. Booziness distracts in my opinion. It's medium bodied with minor carbonation. Midland feel. Decent, a little boozy more than tasty."

"Gordon is hazy and dark orange in color with a modest head and light lacing. Aroma is hoppy and malty, smells sweet. Toasty, woody, sweet and herbal. Taste is dominated by caramel maltiness with noticeable booze; the hops are definitely diminished due to age, unfortunately. Grainy, a little bitter, sweet and bready. Touches of grapefruit I can pnly assume would be much stronger in a fresher can. Biscuity. Very full and creamy mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation. Sticky. Nice lingering finish. Powerful alcohol."

"O: This is the biggest beer I’ve had from the can; the hops pop, the malts are smooth, the alcohol is palpable. Much better than Dale’s Pale Ale. Now if I could only get my hands on a Ten Fidy…"
"A nice American Red, but I've had better. This is just a little bit too sweet for my tastes, and doesn't have that classic skill of combining but keeping separate the grainy malt and the fresh, sharp hops."
"O: Unique choice of hops brings the cat pee factor of this DIPA way up. A bit solvent-like, but it fits a very specific hop fixation. A far cry from a malt-forward DIPA, those who relish in what certain hop varietals can do should enjoy (G'Knight) Gordon quite a bit."
"Taste is sticky caramel malt, mango, and alcohol. This is heavy and pretty boozy. The malt and hops work together well, but this is definitely on the maltier side of DIPAs."
"Surprisingly light; abv is almost completely hidden. Wasn't amazing but I'd have it again."
"Apple cider color and cloudy. Just more than a minimal fluffy head with some life and a little lace. Lots of C-hop pine and citrus aroma. While the hop profile is what you might expect from a West Coast style DIPA, it is better balanced than most, with a fair amount of caramel present in the middle. Big body and medium carbonation. Mild bitter finish given the amount of hopping."
"O- A delicious imperial red. It is much better on tap or more fresh than this but im just now getting around to reviewing it."
"Would love to find it on draft somewhere."
"O - Good, but it was better on tap where the aroma and taste was much more intense, even though this batch was canned about two weeks ago. 'Doesn't taste like any of the red ales I've had in the past."
"D: i definitely would not have classified this as an DIPA. probably not even call this an imperial read. more of a malty brew in my opinion. a big scottish or a small american strong. regardless, a good brew, but not great, and definitely not my favorite from oskar blues."
"O - Pretty enjoyable I would have agin"
"Pours with a redder hued hazy body and an ecru finger-depth head, the beer looks something formidable. Aromas of grassy and citrus-y hops come up and held up well over the 10 month wait to be opened. followed by tropical fruit sweetness. Sweet up front, with a dry chalkiness in the back. Moderate/medium body with lighter carbonation. Very tasty beer, I would go for this again."
"Drink- Tasty and large for sure. Not sure how much would change from having a 4 month fresher can but would it be hoppier?"
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is very hoppy up front, but a strong malt presence is also there. Very well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"DELIGHTFUL BEER FOR YOUR NEXT HIKE/CAMPING!"
"The brewery's definition, as it is, along with BA's pigeonholing, still do not detract from a genuinely enjoyable quaff - more big IPA than red ale, truth be told. Overall: quality hops and malts, ramped up further, with the attendant booze well obfuscated. Bliss, indeed."
"This is a nice, hoppy red ale. I would love to try this fresh, because I can tell the hops would really shine. Solid on all fronts."
"O: This is six-pack worthy, perfect for a round of 18 on the golf course."
"Overall: A very enjoyable brew, and one that I'd buy again if Oskar brews were distributed in Indiana. Fortunately, I have one more from a trade w/ cosmonick, so I'll be enjoying again at some point!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce aluminum can, this beer is a dark-honey colored beverage. Small head, moderate cloudiness. Lots of hop aroma...floral, pine, grapefruit, Not much malt in the aroma, but it does out with some force int he flavor. Also, whereas the ABV isn't evident in the smell, its warming is pronounced from the very first sip. Great balance. Definitively an American strong red ale...the strength and a wonderful bitter hop flavor are showcased. Full body...satisfying heft and firm bitter finish."
"O- Good imperial red. The fact that it's in a can makes it that much cooler, and I wish they had a similar beer around the Chicago area."
"O: A nice DIPA, with a little more fruityness than the most recent I've had before."
"All that being said, this is a very good beer, but it doesn't stack up if you compare it to other great DIPAs. If I was rating this as an Imperial Red, as the name implies, I would give it slightly higher marks. As it stands, the hops need more of an impact for this to be a great DIPA."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Would buy this again."
"O- a nice rich IPA with full body and great balance"
"O - Pretty good. The flavor profile could have done a little more for me, but its pretty balanced and really quite pleasant."
"As soon as you pop the top on the can the malty, hoppy aroma is wonderful. It pours a nice reddish orange and has a head that quickly settles to light lacing on the edges. I really like the malts are light in the beginning and finish stronger. The hops are almost 2nd fiddle to the malt profile but there is a crisp citrus finish. I really enjoyed this one, the warmer it gets just the more bitter. This might be my favorite from Oskar Blues."
"This is a solid beer. I'm not sure it's hoppy enough to be called a DIPA, but it's a solid beer whether you call it a DIPA or Amber Ale. Just another solid OB offering."
"O – An imperial IPA? Darn close. The balance adds much to this beer, pine citrus zest for the hop head and a always present malt backdrop with a sticky smoothness. Well executed, a must try for any BA. 4"
"Overall- Once again OB pulls off another fantastic beer, never disappointed. Cheers"
"O: Fantastic red ale. Highly recommended; worth your time. Drinkable and very good. Will have again."
"Pours a hazy reddish copper with two fingers of clingy head with good retention and lacing. Big aromas here. Lots of orange zest and resinous hops right up front, with sweet malts lurking beneath the deep. Flavors are a bit sweeter than was apparent from the nose, but the hops are even more complex. The interplay of zestiness and caramel and toffee notes defies simple sequencing. G'knight finishes with a long and satisfying burn...god, I love that burn...like a hop and alcohol sizzle! What a pleasant way for each sip to depart. As with everything from Oskar Blues, this is quality stuff."
"O-I previously had this on draft and remember it being much hoppier so I guess I was anticipating more of a west coast style. This beer is no slouch, though. But I wouldn't grab it when I'm craving a hop fix."
"O-this drinks a lot light than the ABV suggests. its quite a great beer. the flavors seems to get more subtle as this goes down. i wouldn't mind getting a whole case of this."
"O- Is this supposed to be a DIPA or an Imperial Red? Since it's listed as a DIPA on here that's the style I'm grading to, which puts it in average territory. Still a nice tasty brew though."
"I'm not a big fan of sweeter brews, so this one falls down a little on my list. But, still a well put together brew whether it's called an Imperial IPA or Imperial Red."
"o: I really liked this, but the sweetness would limit me to one at a time. I've never had anything quite like it."
"This red ipa poured a a deep red, bordering on a brown muddy color. The head was not huge but stuck around for a while. Scent was strong on the hops, you could smell the bitterness. Taste was of very bitter hops, sour cherries, had a sharp bite to it. Juicy mouthfeel. This is a nice red ipa."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its complexity. In this, there was a surprising mix of malts, with deep, roasty, and sweet flavoring. For something classified as such, this brew certainly lacked the hop presence of some of its competitors in the style. This is not to say that it was disliked, but rather that it was unique, and took hops on the back, while putting on a clinic about how to use malts in a DIPA."
"Served a bit on the cold side but once it warmed up a hair a lot more of the malt came through to give it a great smooth finish."
"overall this is a good drinking beer... reminds me I need to drink more red."
"O- A good IPA/hoppy amber, either way you wanna call it. A little underwhelming when considering the price tag."
"Overall - Definitely a great beer that I'm happy I had the chance to try. It really got more enjoyable as it approached room temperature. It would work well as a winter warmer/sipper as well."
"O- great beer. Hoppy yet smooth. Nice for a hot summer day"
"Overall, a really good option for a strong IPA."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass, the beer pours a vibrant amber-copper coloring, with a slight haze to it. Very bright, with a foamy, frothy head to start that settles quickly into a quarter of an inch, white, dense looking foam covering. The nose is malty and spicy, with a great blend of mild roasted caramel and oregano spiced hops, with the slightest hint of fruit sweetness. The beer has light initial flavors, but that is remedied very quickly. The blast of flavor starts with hops bittered caramel sweetness, rich and bold throughout the palate. The fruit sweetness from the nose reveals itself as pineapple in the taste spectrum, and there is also some toasty and boozey character, as well. The beer is slick and smooth in mouth, with little to no carbonation allowing the body to stay heavy and consistent throughout. The aftertaste is an overly tangy sweet and sour blend, with the fruit and the slight hops still present and balancing. The finish lingers a bit, and dries your mouth out very slightly. Tasty brew; refrains from overpowering, yet delivers bold flavors and profiles throughout."
"O: A very enjoyable beer. I think the category of IIPA doesn't exactly fit this beer, though it definitely has some similarities, especially in the smell. It's also plenty hoppy in the flavor, but I'd put it more in the Amber category there. In any case, a tasty beer, sure wish Oskar Blues was available in Iowa, good thing for us that Wisconsin is not that far away. Cheers!"
"I selected this beer primarily because of the awesome flavor/experience of TEN FIDY. This one isn't nearly as satisfying."
"Overall, this is excellent fare, and one of the better beers I've ever had that came from a can. Well worth trying, but beware: the beer's 8.7% ABV doesn't show in the taste, so you might not realize how buzzed you are until you stand up."
"This is the kind of beer I like. Sweet, extremely piney, and hoppy with some tropical fruitiness, peach in this case is noted, is what I love and G'Knight is just that. Hopefully when Truman said, """In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight," he actually mean, """G'Knight.""" Ok, that was corny. Whatever, drink this beer!"
"Overall Impression- Huge hops, good amount of body, and a big time IPA. Very sweet at times and malty but only added to the complexity. This one took quite the effort to drink so wouldn't be coming back to this one but was still good."
"I've never had an Imperial red ale, but it's a good idea, and well-executed here."
"O: Not all that special to me. There are better examples."
"O - A good variation on the traditional IPA. A good choice for someone who enjoys slight IBUs but finds a lot of American IPAs to be over the top hops and is looking for a malted character that balances out and sweetens it a bit."
"Very thick syrupy beer and way unbalanced in favor of malt. Any more than a 12 oz. can and I'm not sure I could've finished it. This is really a mess and I can't agree with the consensus at all. One of the worst beers I had on my west coast trip."
"My first canned beer since Busch Light in the early 90's. I really liked this beer. Will definitely seek out more from Oskar Blues. Highly recommend."
"Hooray cans! My GOODNESS. I had to pick up a six pack of this at Whole Foods after one of the Late Night BA threads made such a fuss over canned beer. I've had long standing reservations against can beer, and this one instantly laid them all to rest. This was so smooth, there's no way you could put it on being an 8.7% beer. Beautiful ruby red color with a nice finger and a half thick head at the top of the glass. Great lacing. Bringing the glass to your mouth was a wonderful assault on your sense of smell. I'll definitely be drinking more of this. Hats off to Oskar Blues."
"overall: this beer has what would you expect from a typical red ale taken to imperial caliber, very drinkable--good abv, well-hopped."
"Poured into a pint glass from the glorious can. Color was a great reddish amber with a whitish head of about two fingers. It generally left some light lacing, and dissipated to a nice little crown pretty quickly. Smell has a great malty nose with ample hoppiness in the aroma of citrus. Taste has the maltiness, but the citrus and floral is very prevalent. Feel is smooth, with ample carbonation and an oily finish. Overall I really enjoyed this IIPA and will gladly purchase it again."
"Not a bad beer here. The bitterness is a bit to dominant for my taste. Definitely worth a try."
"Heavy mouthfeel, sticky on the lips, and smooth drinking. This beer has gravity; total sleepytime beer. I passed out 2/3 through my 3rd can, woke to find the remaining 3rd and drink it warm, which was litterally like drinking candy. when it warms, it turns into hop-syrup. I love it so much."
"This pours a dark copper / reddish color with a white head which leaves a nice lacing. The smell is of grapefruit and citrus hops with some sweet caramel malts. The feel is medium with plenty of carbonation. The taste is some sweet malts balanced by a bunch of hoppy bitterness. Overall this is a little sweet but not too bad, having this one night after the Gubna the two are similar although this has less sweetness and less hops."
"Overall this is a solid, tasty DIPA....not a head-shrinking hop bomb but with a good strong hop presence. Handy in a can, but at this alcohol level, not a beer that you would swill several of at a sporting event or picnic."
"o - overall not a huge fan of red ales and imperial red ale is a bit not my thing. not a bad beer by any means, but sorry jeff, this won't be a go to beer for me, like it is for you, but i will never turn one down if offered ;)"
"O- A good beer, but nowhere near the top of the Imperial Red class. MANY others I like more. Good drinkability."
"*Paired with turkey lasagna."
"O: A bit rough around the edges and definitely too sweet for my tastes. As an IPA, it’s a malty sugary mess, as an imperial red, it’s still rather sweet and syrupy with a ton of bitterness."
"Why the can is labeled as ‘Imperial Red’ is beyond me. This is and IPA all the way. As I suspected from the beginning, this is another Oskar Blues offering I will certainly recommend to anyone who enjoys a quality brew with pungent hops and a nice malt balance."
"Not a bad brew by any means, but not quite what I had hoped or expected. Less hoppy in terms of bitterness and more sweet and """burny""" from the alcohol. I'd recommend trying, but don't buy a case of it."
"o - Overall a pretty good beer from Oskar Blues. Nothing mind blowing and not overly hopyy, but just a really wel done, easy to drink red ale/IPA. Would give it another shot."
"O: This is a decent take on the Imperial red style, but overall the syrupy feel and heat from the alcohol take away from the brew."
"A pretty amber orange color with a slight haze. Also saw the interesting oatmeal-colored froth that RonfromJersey mentioned. Powerful alcohol and cherry sweetness in the aroma. The cherry comes through first, next, and last in my palate. It really is a very nice flavor. I only gave the taste slightly lower marks because I wanted a few more notes---I like Imperial IPAs with hops, citrus and pine in the same sip, so the dominant cherry in G'Knight is yummy, but I want the (nice tasting) hops or other fruits to step forward a bit more. Excellent lingering sweetness after you swallow, cherry and a little brown sugar, a great beer for sipping slowly as you work on your computer (or procrastinate by writing one of these reviews). A great, big beer to try. I'll seek it out again."
"Final thought - only $3 on draft and almost 9% this beer rules"
"Gordon poured out as a nice red color with a foamy white head on top. The head was very thick and have a good retention to it. The smell of the beer was hoppy and very inviting. The taste of the beer had a great hop quality on the tongue and has a good flavor overall. The malts were mostly found in the aftertaste along with the dry hop bitterness. The mouth feel of this beer had a good thickness to it. Overall I found this beer to be very enjoyable it was probably one of my favorite beers of the American craft beer festival in 2010. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Overall a winner and worth searching out."
"Overall I like this beer and purchase it every now and then. Packs a punch."
"Overall: I quite like this combination of potent malts and toned down hops (when compared to an IIPA). Again, not distributed in Utah, even though we are right next door. :-("
"Overall, its good. The simcoe or citra hops kinda kill it for me."
"A good DIPA, but it may be suffering in my eyes after several bottles of Hopslam earlier this week. At $15/4 pack, I don't see me returning to this on a regular basis. Good to try though."
"Overall: The intense sweetness is a little bit much for me, even with the huge load of citrusy, resiny hops."
"This beer pours a nice reddish copper color with a huge slightly off white head. The smell is floral and Piney with some citrus notes as well. the flavor is bursting with hoppy goodness up front followed buy a caramel like malt backbone to keep it rounded. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than i was expecting, but overall the beer is a solid A"
"O- Not a big IPA guy but this thing blew me away. Top 5 beers of all time for me hands down. It was aggressive but nice to my taste buds. I will get this beer again if I can find it - amazing."
"o-I am in love with this beer, and am happy to have it so fresh year round. Great cross between a red and an IPA. I don't think there is anything Imperial about it other then the alcohol content."
"Overall this is a fantastic IPA and I wish that I could get this here in a Ohio. Its great to be able to get an excellent craft beer in a can."
"As a hybrid DIPA/Imperial Red this shines. The nose on this is intoxicating. It's almost a sensory over load. It has a nice malt backbone and drinks easy for the ABV."
"I have always liked this beer. Glad I finally got around to reviewing it."
"Retried this again, definitely boosting it up. There's something about oskar blues beers that make them unique. Loved the taste this time around more than i remember."
"O: This is a highly drinkable Imperial Red. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice hop finish and sweet malt make this a balanced beer."
"Interesting flavor to this one. Definitely hoppy and bitter, but there's almost an off flavor in there too. It's medicinal or soapy even. But that's only part of the beer. The rest is piney and sticky in it's hoppiness, with almost no hint of the 8.7 percent ABV. The finish is clean and easy, and pretty dry. Booziness comes out a little more in the aftertaste. The off-flavors become less and less noticeble as the beer warms up and your taste buds adjust the beer. In fact the more and more this warms up, the better the flavors meld together into an almost sweet hoppiness that balances out the bitterness nicely. Okay, now I feel better about this one. I wasn't used to any off flavors from Oskar Blues, so its good that I'm enjoying this more now. Overall, a good brew, one that fits nicely in with all of Oskar Blues other great beers."
"O- Really good stuff. Just super easy drinking beer that is really balanced and flavorful. I will defiantly be getting this again. I wish this was on tap around me because it would be a go to beer for sure."
"O - Overall very good. It's somewhere between an IPA and a Red Ale, as advertised. Nice, unique style of beer. Very easy to drink at 8.7%! Better than any Gordon Biersch crap."
"M - Wouldn't guess this was 8.7%, super drinkable and refreshing, nicely carbonated"
"Opinion: Overall this is a really good beer. I wish that the carbonation had been a little higher, and this seems to be a trend lately with Oskar Blues beers IMO. Otherwise, there is a solid balance between the malt and hops and I like the overall finish. I am glad that I am drinking this beer, and will finish the other three no problem. I doubt that I will buy the cans again, but it would be nice to try this beer on tap sometime."
"Medium body, nice feel from the carbonation. There is some heat from the alcohol, but not bad. Pretty interesting beer."
"Thanks Ryan for the freshie...the elder can was good still, but the new blew it away!."
"Overall this is an excellently balanced imperial red and another terrific offering by Oskar Blues. I would recommend this to anyone...I just wish I didn't have to go across the Illinois border to pick this up."
"Very enjoyable."
"O - I liked this, and would have liked it even more if the alcohol taste could have stayed a bit hidden. Not too shabby though, as the alcohol taste wasn't enough to put me off."
"A pretty good beer, though there are many better hoppy red ales (not to mention double IPAs in general) out there. Not the best value, but I'd still bring these camping any time."
"Wow very impressed and description of a hoppy amber meets its mark. I'd even say this is just a mild hint of hop but noticeable and incredibly balanced in it's feel and flavor. Solid brew from these guys. Not a knockout DIPA, not a knockout Amber, but for how it describes itself from the brewers it's flat out fantastic."
"O - A good beer for a summer night. I will be drinking the rest straight outta the can, how I prefer ;)"
"Pours a pretty cleark dark ruby amber with a slight creamy white cap. The nose carries some simplistic rich caramel malts along with a light hoppy pine smell. The taste brings more of the same easy going and drinking, with little to no complexity. In the mouth it had nice carbonation though i found it to be a bit astrigent and the abv was noticeable. It is what it is i would much rather drink this beer at the higher abv to get a buzz going than something similar you could find at around 5-6% for comparable quality."
"Really good for a malty,bitter imperial red."
"Narrative: Guillermo shivered and watched his breath cascade out in lingering mist. Ecuador never seemed so far away as he looked out upon the expanse of the taiga belt. Just north he could see frozen scrubbrush and south he saw his task at hand: lumbering. Mile after mile of looming coniferous enemies, waited to be felled. His members only jacket provided minimal warmth and made him long for the oppressive heat during the days that he would harvest palm hearts. """GUILLERMO! MAN THE FELLERBUNCHER AND START WORKING ON THE LICHEN AREAS!""" He knew that he was a competent lumberjack, but he longed for his lumber jill, Ysidra, left behind in his home land. He would serve amiably in either profession, but he could not help but feel a bit out of place under the watchful eye of the demanding Canadian foreman. At his core, he was Guillermo, a wonderous man capable of felling Palm and Gymnosperm alike."
"O- I guess this is a IIPA... just a little bit out of bounds. Like calling the White Stripes a Blues band... it's kinda there, but goes off on some other kind of wonderful tangent! Definately worth trying if you haven't."
"Overall this is a good beer. It has its short comings but good. Can't say much more then that."
"O: For sure a great beer!"
"Overall - this is my fav OB beer so far probably and I've had ten fidy"
"O - one of my favorites no doubt, i wish there was a more complex flavor going on but i still love it for what it is...if this was not distributed to where i am i would trade for it, just sayin...DRINK IT NERDS AND RUN FOR THE FENCE"
"O/D-Overall, this is worth a try. Where I live a 4-pack of this is far too expensive. However, this beer does malty very well The alcohol is masked amazingly. This by no means steers me away from hop-forward brews (which I love the most) but it is an interesting take on the style. One word to describe this beer: rich."
"O: A really easy drinking DIPA. Might be lacking a hop bite for what I like in the style, but it is really east drinking and very solid. Love a good beer in a can."
"Overall this is one of my favorites... In the top 5 for me. I love IPAS with something more and this truly delivers. One if the great beers that every hop head should try at least once."
"O: This is a great red! Amazingly drinkable. It's clean and crisp with that slight hint of hint of hop. I was very impressed."
"O: Amazingly drinkable, the freshest, cleanest hop profile I think I've ever smelled, and a beautifully clean and fresh taste. Seriously, this drinks like a beer version of sweet tea. Amazing."
"Overall I am surprised with this beer and now believe this is my new favorite of the style (sorry Nugget Nectar!) Big, hoppy, but with an extremely solid sweet amber malt base this beer is sure to make me go out for a four pack. If only Oskar Blues four packs were cheaper around here..."
"Who doesn't like beer in a silver can? This beer pours an amber color with the smell of floral hops. The taste is more malty then anything, but floral hops in the back end. With it's price tag, I would only buy this beer when you are tired of the other DIPA in your rotation."
"O--Great brew! Heavy hop & malt flavors up front with biting alcohol aftertaste. Definitely something I will seek out in the future."
"A 4 pack of these will lay you out quick."
"From the tap to a pint glass. Pours a dark and cloudy amber with an off-white head. Piney hops dominate the nose, with some citrus in there too. The taste is remarkably malty with a well balanced character of hops - piney as well as citrus - some grapefruit notes as well provide a bitter finish. Very interesting brew."
"Pours an amber-brown, murky and unfiltered. Creamy, thick head about a finger or so high of eggshell colour. Good head and lace. Nose has big citrus hops and pine cones. Nice and hoppy with a subtler malt balance, some caramel and toffee sweetness. Taste has more citrus, with the balance tilted towards some orange and tangerine. Pine takes a step back here, but still hangs out in the periphery. Finish has all the malt, and isn't too big on the bitterness. Lingering mouthfeel, medium body. Alcohol is invisible. Nice imperial red that suffers a bit from being over the hill. Needs revisiting."
"Overall-A little bit too much alcohol in there, but besides that good beer. This may be an IPA that may get better with age, who knows."
"Its very smooth in the mouth with more of a hop bitterness in the aftertaste."
"Overall an extremely enjoyable beer. Dangerously drinkable despite the full body. The alcohol is unnoticeable."
"This is a fantastic double IPA. It drinks easy for such a higher alcohol brew. Brew is so balanced and is worth seeking out for sure."
"Can to frosty pint. And I'm not pleased about that (the former, not the latter). Pours with a reddish tint, as the name suggests. Bouquet is great; chock full of pine and citrus. Carbonation is almost nonexistent. While it's a decent effort for a can, it's not something I'd go out of my way to find, especially given the abundance of delicious DIPAs."
"O- very nice. looks great and tastes even better. pending on the price this could be a more regular beer for me"
"Overall, I love this beer and while it doesn't really fit the DIPA status given here it is still a wonderful canned offering that I will definitely be seeking out in the near future."
"Okay, so it's in a can. Get over it. This was the surprise highlight at a recent brewfest. Overall reddish-brown ale, clear. Well balanced. Crisp, clean, and floral hoppy smell and taste - quite bitter....but it it goes down smooooth with an amazing aftertaste that seems to just stick with you."
"This is the second Oskar Blues beer I've tried. Very enjoyable. Looking forward to sampling future brews from this company."
"Overall Drinkability - Really enjoyable IPA."
"12oz can purchased at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, NY. Pours a hazed copper hue with amber edges, a thin ring of bubbly, cream-coloured head, and strands of stringy lacing on the tulip. Smell is pine sap, citrus, floral, grassy, and resinous hops, touch of lemon, raspberries, cedar needles, toast, fruity esters, and liquor. Taste does not live up to the aroma - I get sweet caramel, orange peel, pine, ethanol, spicy and citric hop bitterness, a bit of alcoholic burn on the tongue with a cloyingly malty aftertaste. Way too malt-forward for my liking, seems like the dry-hopping comes through in the nose but doesn't add much to the flavour. Mouthfeel is creamy-medium upfront, juicy middle, bitter spiciness precedes a malted finish with some heat in the throat. Overall, a reasonably well-crafted but unimpressive DIPA that I probably wouldn't buy again. Decent, and nothing more."
"A big off-white, frothy head, almost 2 fingers. Color is chestnut amber with red tones. Nice clarity and the head is persistent. Good creamy lace. Smell is super sprucey with big grapefruit notes. Sweet malts hide in there, but really pulls a knockout in the taste department. Back to the nose, since it has a lot going on here. There's citrus, fruit notes like natural strawberry chews, big hearty herbed bread, caramel malts and moist bread. The malt notes come out as it warms, but the hops still stay strong. Wow, the taste also has tons going on. Sweeter and spicier than the nose yields. Super sweet malts, caramel malts, spicy, zesty hops, slight white pepper, grassy hop finish, some alcohol warming as the alcohol vapor firts with the back of the throat and some lemon bread and tropical fruits. Medium mouthfeel, but super slick and smooth makes this one quaffable Imperial beer. A really good balance of drinkability and big bold flavors."
"O: A delicious ale, but the aroma is deceiving. I would have liked to see a more defined hop bitterness and a little more carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer that i will definitely be purchasing again."
"Reallly a full body on this. It's a little sticky with nice lively carbonation. Overall this one is enjoyable. It's a bit heavy to drink more than one of, but that's alright for this guy."
"Almost a perfect beer. Taste isn't exactly perfect but very tasty. Malts and hops smell perfect and make this look great. I wish I bought a six pack of Gordon for later consumption, another one of these would put me over-the-top. It does get a little heavy in the belly but overall totally worth it."
"O: Perfectly balanced. This is one of the best beers on the market. Absolutely delicious."
"O: wonderful, interesting beer."
"D - Another solid beer from Oskar Blues. Would not have guessed that this offering was 8.7% ABV. I could see this beer sneaking up on me after a couple. I personally liked it better after letting it warm up a bit, as the hops came through more than they did in the beginning."
"F&CK!!!! This is a good beer!! Even more BIZAAR is where I had it...Johnstown, Pennsylvania!!!! NO SH%T!!! This beer is awesome! If I see it in my local bev store...ALL OVER IT!!! The color is a clear Amber with 1/2 finger head....but wonderful lace. The nose included a hop with hints of citrus. The taste was full body...meaning the ABV was awesomely balanced by malt and hop. There was a subtle citrus to this beer...this beer is what I would love all reds to taste like!!! The mouth feel was even and balance and I would absolutely SESSION this ale like a kamakazee!!!"
"This can pours a dark and rich amber in color with a light foam that laces the glass. It smells of a hoppy/malty battle for supremacy. I'd say the sweet maltiness wins. The hops are dry and like pine bark. The flavors are of wet pine and caramel sweet malts. I prefer more hop presence. It drinks like it should for the style. It does leave the caramel malt flavor behind in the aftertaste. Its a good beer but for this style I'm pretty picky."
"D: This is drinkable, but not my favorite from these guys. I'm having a hard time pegging this beer. It seems part red part ipa."
"On tap at Pizzeria Paradiso in DC, poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear medium amber that has some nice glowing edges and has a creamy slightly off-white head slowly dissolves into a nice thin layer around and atop the glass. The aroma has a sticky resinous hop bouquet that is accompanied by some brown sugar but still is dominated by the hops. The flavor is sweet candy up front with some sweet hops and brown sugar. The sweet bitterness lingers for sometime after each drink. Gordon is a light to medium bodied beer with light carbonation. Above average brew."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a very solid beer with lots of flavor that comes across as pretty well balanced."
"O/D: It's a shame this only came in a 10 ounce pour. Delicious, and so glad I finally got to try it (and it was fresh! My biggest fear of buying this in cans)."
"Overall. Good stuff but a little boozy."
"O - Another beautiful beer from Oskar Blues. Perfect out on a D.C. patio at the beginning of spring--very refreshing. Could only handle two at lunchtime given the ABV, but I'll definitely be having this again."
"Overall I've loved this beer every time I have had it. This is the freshest I have had G'Night and am really pleased. A must pick-up fresh or not!!"
"The CPJ"
"O - (love the new overall, by the way!) Great beer. As always, Oskar Blues does it right. Great, hoppy red, but not overpowering. Almost a great session beer. Just a bit too big to be one, but I have no problem putting two or three away. The booze hides nicely, and the bitter never overpowers. Great beer. Highly recommended."
"D - Liked this one to the bottom of the glass. A tasty example of an Imperial Red. About as sweet as a Great Divide Hercules but more bitter."
"Another winner from Oskar Blues."
"Drinkability: Calling this beer drinkable would be an understatement. I don't normally drink IPA because the hops tend to be too much for me but the malts in this one take edge off of the hops taste. I think Oskar Blues has done a superb job honoring the man they made the beer for."
"D - Well hidden ABV, drinks like a red but with extra hopping. Solid offering by Oskar Blues."
"I highly recommend trying this one. Oskar Blues has been impressing me a lot lately. One of Colorado's finest."
"Drinkability: Hard to measure. This afternoon I found it boozy and hot, tonight I think it is almost too mild and definitely drinkable, dangerously so! If we compare it to a Double IPA, it might not be up to a lot of folks' standards. But as an Imperial Red/Amber/Whatever, I think it rocks the style."
"I had a Gubna earlier, and this is only faintly distinct from that. Gubna has a little more herbal bitterness and G'Knight has a little more malt sweetness. Both are good not great."
"This one, friends, is great."
"Drinkability: I'm going to say this is probably my favorite beer. I haven't had one for a couple months, and I kind of figured I was over this after having many other more highly regarded hop and hype monsters. I poured this out and remembered why I loved it, instantly with how beautiful it looks, how wonderful it smells and how great it still tastes."
"D: At this ABV I don't know how many you'd want to put back, but it wouldn't be hard to go overboard either."
"Cheers"
"For a DIPA, it drinks fairly well. I don't think I'd finish off the four pack on a weeknight, but I could also have more than one. I don't fully agree with the brewery's classification of G'Knight as an Imperial Red. It is much more like a DIPA. If I wanted an Imperial Red, I'd grab a bottle of Southern Tier's Big Red or Lagunitas Lucky 13."
"Generously hopped malty red beer! Thick head with lots of sticky lacing (it even speaks of it on the can). We were both like...cans??? But had to give it shot-slightly pricey at 10 bucks for a Four pack, but well worth it. If you're a fan of hoppy red beers, this is definite Must Try to add to your repertoire! :)"
"Drinkability: This was my first Oskar Blues beer and still probably my favorite of the bunch (might tie with Ten Fidy). This is one of the most drinkable American Double/ Imperial IPA's that your going to find. Another high note for this great brewery."
"Overall - a great surprise. Reds are usually such a bore!"
"Clear, reddish brown in color, with an off-white head that is foamy and persistent. The aroma is fresh but rather faint, with some sweet malt and not much else. Luscious, mouthfilling sweet malt flavor that finishes with some hoppy astringency. A highly drinkable, high alcohol red. Highly recommended as a way to get a day of sailing started on a late fall day, at about 9:30 or 10 a.m."
"Drinkability: The 8.7% ABV is well hidden for this dangerously drinkable hoppy red ale. This is very close to Lagunitas Lucky 13 Mondo Red."
"OVERALL: Pleasant, different and very good. I'm happy I managed to find a can before the name changed, but I'll be looking for G'Knight as soon as Oskar manages to get some distribution back home in Chicago. It's a shame I had to drive to Nashville to find it."
"well, i like this beer a lot, but i'm kinda bummed that it's not an imperial red ale like it says on the can. personally, paying 10.99 for a four pack of cans that aren't what they say they are pisses me off. the minute i poured this sucker i felt tricked, i was expecting something deep red, not hazy amber. this should be called GORDON imperial amber, or GORDON winter warmer. anyway, smell is sweet, malty, and as it warms you get that barely wine nose. the taste to me is nicely balanced, i dig how the malts hit first, and then you get hops, then end with malts again. here's the thing, i really love RED ales, but only like amber ales. they are not the same thing, to say an amber ale is a red ale, would be like saying a PA is a IPA. this beer is not a red ale."
"D- Very interesting this is the hoppiest red I have had"
"Had this on tap at Duckworth's in Charlotte, tasted fresh, I would buy again."
"Pours a beautiful reddish amber. Tons of frothy head despite my slow pour. Huge bubbles and lacing up the wazoo. Smells crisp and hoppy. Some nice piney resin coupled with some citrus and grapefruit hints. Tastes thick... A bit almost syrupy. Tons and tons of hops. A few sips in the hop profile backs down a bit. I cant tell if it's my taste buds or the warming if the beer but the second half of the glass is an absolute malt bomb. I've never expienced such a stark contrast in one pint before. The mouthfeel is solid and it's fairlydrinkable"
"DB- Easily drinkable for the style, balanced and smooth. Hop flavors are nice but I have certainly had better examples of the Double IPA."
"Overall, this is a solid double ipa. Bold hops with a sweet caramel backbone that makes this well balanced and dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a deep red/amber. No head, but plenty of lacing as it goes down. Smell is fairly hoppy with some sweet malt as well. Taste is basically opposite. Sweet malt dominates the palate with a nice hoppy flavor and bitterness coming along for the ride. Very smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect and a residual sweetness lingers on the palate for a while. This us a very good beer weather you wanna call it an imperial red or double ipa."
"D: Damn drinkable imperial red ale, here; good stuff... my new favorite Oskar Blues brew!"
"Smells hoppier than it tastes. Has botanical and grapefruit notes, and is pretty floral. It's also a little sweeter than most ipa's. It has a fresh taste to it. Overall it is a good beer for someone who isn't crazy about ipa. I would definitely buy it again."
"D: This is just like GUBNA but lower in alcohol and not as thick."
"I see myself buying atleast a sixer or two of this a year, given I see that its fresh."
"Due to a legal threat (thanks, Gordon Biersch), this beer's name will soon be changing from Gordon to G'Knight. Whatever the name, this is an excellent hybrid of a Double IPA and an Imperial Amber/Red Ale. I try to treat myself to a 4-pack whenever I can; I highly recommend that you do the same. Well done, Oskar Blues, well done..."
"D Medium body makes this very drinkable"
"D- This was perhaps the most balanced DIPA I've had. Could've used a little more hop intensity but this didn't fall short by any means. Alcohol is very well masked, aromas are fantastic, and the brew leaves lacing all over. This beer is a prime example to not judge a book by its cover. Oskar Blues has somethin goin with their cans of beer, can't wait to try Ten Fidy."
"A very drinkable DIPA, thick citrus American hop flavor and aroma. Medium body, lower carbonation, nice malt backbone to balance out the hops, very little heat perceivable despite the 8% abv. A well done example of the style. Also extra points for packaging too."
"D: All things considered, yes, this is highly drinkable...but probably not advisable for long sessions..."
"Marked: Canned on 07-27-10 @ 12:42. Sampled on January 17, 2011. The pour is a slight cloudy amber-orange with a thin head. The aroma is elegant and brings out a variety of scents like pine, earth, hops (definitely),and highly sweetened malts. The body is smooth and creamy and comes in above average. The flavor has a lot going on from sickly sweetness to pungent bitterness. Hops, syrup, and molasses seem to be the taste of the day. Really unique."
"This comes in a can, I see. Might have to sample it from that someday. This is a well-made brew - Big, like the other fine OB brews I've enjoyed."
"d 3 the hops and alcohol probably conspire together to dry this one during the finish to such an extent that after each sip i feel absolutely parched. this is one of the only beers i've ever had that makes me want a glass of water alongside for rehydration between sips. i had high hopes, but i don't see this becoming one of my favorites any time soon."
"D- This is a easy to drink DIPA and I could have a few in one sitting. This is my first beer from Oskar Blues and it has really changed my mind on what canned beer can be."
"D: Very easy drinking for a DIPA (or Imperial Red). Wholly enjoyed the glass and could go for a few of these in a row."
"12oz can. Pours a a murky, dark amber color with basically no head. Very little lacing. Damn fine aroma. Mix of floral and piney hops, some pineapple, and sweet citrus. Taste is hoppy. Pine and floral flavors are most prevalent. Somewhat sweet and less bitterness than I expected from a Double. Taste does remind me of a Red Ale, which I guess it is supposed to. Nice drinkablity for a beer North of 8%. Worth adding as a regular in your rotation of hoppy beers."
"Drink: Glad I only got a four pack. It's pretty mellow, which isn't bad. Just not in my super-cool catagory."
"A pretty tasty and easy to drink brew."
"I'd like to revisit this when I can get a fresh can in either NH/MA."
"The drinkability of this beer is high. I wish I had a few more."
"Very nice."
"Drinkability is really superb, if only because it will take a lot of these to appreciate all of the flavors it has to offer. Combine that with the easy transportability of a can, and I may have a new brew to take along for long hikes as a celebratory beverage."
"The mouth feel is creamy and smooth, more substantial than most IPAs. I would have no problem drinking another, but I had to drive home."
"Feels good in the mouth- Smooth, balanced, refreshing. If I was into this maltier style IPA more I could drink a lot of this, but this is a little sweet for me. 8.7% with close to no alcohol present does the trick though. Perfect for travel being in a can- Ill def be enjoying these on the beach in the summer!"
"This is a thick, syrupy DIPA, not my cup of tea."
"D-A very drinkable beer for the style, even dangerously so. Glad i only bought a 4pk of this as I just couldn't stop drinking this beer!"
"D - very quaffable for a beer of this abv. I wished it was a little thicker but it is still a very tasty imperial amber."
"Was impressed with this beer, I'd buy it again."
"Standard medium body but sticky dry flavor wraps around the palate quickly. ABV is masked well but the beer isn't over yet. Overall a pretty crazily hopped up beer which is capable of making some noise."
"T- This is a solid IPA/Pale ale. It is hoppy bitter with a floral aftertaste. Very solid, but nothing that jumps through the roof, either."
"D- it comes in a can, it's called Gordon, and it's good... if I wanted to take a good beer in a can on a camping trip this would be a good selection. The ABV isn't noticeable, it's a very solid offering, makes me want to try more OB stuff."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a very yellow-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hops, and freshly cut grass. The flavor was of sweet malt, big bittering hops, subtle caramel, and slight wild onion on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Well balanced for the most part, but becomes hop heavy at the end. Not sure about the wild onion flavor, but it wasn't too invasive. This one is a must try if you have not had it."
"Very pleasant and not overpowering double IPA."
"This is an exceptionally smooth beer. It is pleasant and easy to drink, with just enough carbonation to keep from seeming flat. The ABV is very well masked here, making it very drinkable for a DIPA."
"Overall, this beer is very enjoyable. Somewhat fruity, smooth texture, and just sweet enough to balance out the hops and alcohol. Really nice."
"D. very drinkable, i would buy this again if i had the opportunity to pair it with something."
"Overall, the Oskar Blues Gordon Ale is a very well crafted Double IPA with the incredibly inviting aroma and not overly sweet citrus finish that will leave you wanting more and more."
"D-The combination of the intense pine notes and the dry mouthfeel encourage me to never pick this one up again. I think I'm going to try to age the rest of it and see how some time treats this beer."
"I like this beer and I'm certainly glad I picked up a 4 pack. With that said, I probably won't reach for this again unless I can buy it in singles."
"D- Very easy to drink if you love hops. Nicely balanced."
"M/D - Quite a thick mouth and low to medium carbonation is a perfect combination for this beer, even though it makes it a little hard to finish more than one. No problem tho, this is a an exemplary beer"
"Enjoy this is hard to find but possible!If you like this beer pick up a variety pack and try 2 others as well!"
"D - I enjoyed this one quite a bit but the huge amounts of sweetness knocks it down a few notches. A good offering from the kings of cans."
"D=This beer had no deficiencies but it is a beer that I could enjoy all night long."
"Pours a moderate amber-red color with an off white head. The nose is citrus hops and a bit of sweeter malt in the background. The taste is a bit overly sweet, almost verging on being cloying. A pretty good amount of citrus and slight bitterness. Bitter and sweet both for sure in the feel. Drinkability is pretty good, but it's a bit too sweet in the end."
"Copper in color with a prominent reddish hue. Poured with a strong beige head. Complex aroma that included floral and citrus hop character and a hint of pine. Buttery smooth feel. On the heavier side of medium bodied with light carbonation. Big hoppy herbal and citrus hop flavors with a sweet malty undertone throughout and light hoppy pine finish. The light alcohol burn at the finish takes the edge off the pine aftertaste for a nice clean finish. An exceptional DIPA."
"In both instances the alcohol is hidden pretty well, though there is a warming sensation. I'm also grading Gordon as an imperial red; I just can't make this jive with a DIPA. I like the 2010 better if only for it being [somewhat] fresher. Looks like I'll have to keep an eye out for a current bottle."
"Pours a light brown amber color with a nice two finger head with perfect lacing down the glass. When smelling the beer, a wonderful explosion of hops greets the nostrils. The taste pretty much straight hops, with an excellent level of bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely sticky, and a tad chewy, full bodied and overall pretty dang tasty. It was the first beer from Oskar Blues I have tried, and it was overall a nice, if not standard, Double IPA. It was definitely good, but didn't quite distance itself from the competition to be put in the outstanding category, in my opinion."
"I've had it on tap before -- I think it's better that way, good enough for me to seek it out."
"12 oz. can declares """Big, Red, Sticky.""" Brewed with six malts, three hops and a """muthalode""" of Amarillo hops to 85 IBUs. It's a nice auburn hue, fairly clear, with low carbonation, a half-inch of tan head that deposits decent lacing. Piney, spicy and citric resinous hop oils in the nose; herbal and floral, with some caramel malts and a breath of ethanol. Sweet, fruity, hoppy and bitter on the palate, in that order. Wonderful hops, rich crystal malts, sweet with a smooth bitterness. Lightly warming. It has a nice dry body, with fine-bubbled carbonation and it drinks like a big red ale. The ABV holds the drinkability back a bit, but it is a tasty beer that will age gracefully - my sample is past the best-by date and is doing just fine."
"D: This beer is a strong, malt-forward ale that features some interesting hop flavors as well. Those flavors could complement each other more harmoniously at times, and this serving tasted like it was at least 8.7% abv. Gordon represents the American-hopped equivalent of a strong, sweet doppelbock, and would likely serve in many of the classic food pairings of that style (slow-cooked meats, some desserts, etc.)"
"D: Gubna is a much better brew IMO. I found myself getting weary of the session about mid-pint. After finishing, I had one of those, """Thank goodness it's over!""" moments. Not bad, but I was expecting more."
"Pours clear amber with a decent head. The aroma is sweet and candylike the flavor is rich and carmelly, with buckwheat honey and a huge slap of grapefruit hops. The bitterness is deep, rich and enveloping. The mouthfeel is thick and slick. Very good."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into my Zatec fluted glass. Got a nice finger of white head, which dies fairly quickly. Lacing at the top lasts quite awhile though. Smells VERY malty, a lot of pine resin, some citrus. Taste is quite balanced. Strong malt presence, pine, and a long lingering bitter finish. Quite sticky and resiny on the mouth. Drinks amazingly for 8.7 percent. Dangerous beer."
"All in all, a very good DIPA. It's definitely highly drinkable. The balance is pretty good, the sweetness isn't detracting from the hoppiness, and the hops aren't overbearing."
"Edit: Called """Gordon""" when I drank it!"
"Overall, a really nice drinkable beer. Nicely balanced, but still hoppy. Definitely great for a hot day."
"Batch 6-30-10. Sorry, was not good."
"-for me it gets that .5 upgrade for the fact that it is in a can and you can take it anywhere. have had a gordon on top of a mountain before and it's a real treat. i went back to stock up for a reason"
"D: Still a very hoppy beer for an all-nighter, but I could certainly have 2 or 3 of these in succession, very drinkable."
"D: A very drinkable DIPA with a pleasant hop bitterness and overall low dominating alcohol presence"
"D: The hops are a little piney for my tastes but the bitterness doesn't linger too much. Not the best IIPA in my book but still an awesome beer out of a can."
"Very drinkable. Very balanced double IPA."
"Well, not exactly a true red, but copper/amber is close enough, I suppose. Carbonation is awfully low, but that tends to be my experience with OB. Sticky might be the perfect word to describe this beer. This is perhaps the least-hoppy DIPA I've encountered. Caramel and chocolate malts are everywhere, and the viscous sweetness all seems a bit unnecessary. I can't really taste the ABV and would have guessed a little lower than it is, but it's not all that drinkable. A little too oily for my taste, especially for this style."
"The pour is a nice copper color with very little head and decent bit of lace on the glass. The drink is a great experience and the ABV is well balanced for a full hop flavor, mild creamy malt and not too much of an alcohol bite at all. The smell is flowery with noticable hops. Very good a true step up from the Dale's."
"D-This may be the most drinkable higher ABV beer I have ever had. It is like cool aid for adults. It is so delicious, so utterly quaffable that it can easily get you in trouble. No way this tasts like nearly 9% ABV. They call it the velvet M-80. I could not think of a better nickname, but as for me, I call it my favorite DIPA of all time. The fact that this comes in a can only adds to the appeal."
"D - Its a unique example of the style, but there is a hotness to it which reduces me wanting to drink more than one. This is something DIPA lovers should try, as it is a unique example of the style."
"Despite the 8.7% ABV, Gordon is remarkably drinkable. While it has enough hops to satisfy the seasoned hop head, it is still approachable for those who like a more balanced double IPA. All in all, this is a damn fine beer."
"D- This is a beer that I could drink many of, but is best savored. I really enjoyed this and I will be having this many more times. A must try for hop heads."
"Smell is of pine, caramel, grassy, citrus, brown sugar...very sweet in the nose. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a bit of a raisin flavor going on in there as well. Again, it's very sweet, even bordering cloying with the pine and brown sugar. Not too bad but not knocking my socks off either. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, seemingly under-attenuated, fizzy, and sweet."
"Drinkability: Lots to chew on with this beer and a lot of fun."
"For the jaded über-beer geek, Gordon might appear a bit tame. For those who enjoy hops or are looking to get into big hoppy beers, Gordon offers a great balance of bold flavor and drinkability--with a nice kick in the ass."
"SO easy drinking for 8.7% abv. Could easily drink the 4 pack, and be walking on sunshine halfway through the third."
"next time no can."
"D- I wanted to note absolutely no metallic taste coming from a can. This is wonderful music festival beer, as they never let you bring in bottles. and most canned beer sucks. I might be an unfair judge as I love hoppy ambers, especially one with such a satisfying ABV @ 8.7. So good, I would have definitely have another."
"Pours a clear dark amber with two finger head which leaves great lacing throughout and has great retention. The smell is an oily hop scent - pine with some citrus. Taste is similar - floral and piney hops but with a caramel malt character in the back. Medium-bodied and a great carbonation for the style. Very tasty and drinkable."
"Drinkable- very enjoyable beer to drink as the balance really makes you want to look forward to the next sip, makes me remember just how much i love a good double ipa and why, you can definitely notice the abv but its not to cumbersome. A very nice beer that I will definitely have again in the future."
"D - this is a solid double ipa. Bold hops with a sweet caramel backbone that makes this well balanced and dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: the hops rasp on the palate, but are extremely tasty. I think the intensity might get to me, personally, after a few of these, but still I'd be glad to knock back a couple."
"D- The abv is high and the sweetness restricts the drinkability. that being said, as far as iipa's go, this is a pretty well made and drinkable one."
"Pours from the can (God, I love cans!!!) a nice amber/red color,with a nice tan head resting atop. Great big piney/citrusy hop nose and a huge hoppy flavor to go with it (along with caramel, sweet malt and alcohol). An excellent Imperial Red, made even better by the can."
"Thanks to jgasparine for this brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 3/15/2010. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an amber/red color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is grassy and citrusy (grapefruit and tropical fruit) hops, caramel malt, and a bit of spice. The taste is similar to the aroma, however the bitter hops come out much more in the taste compared to the aroma which I thought was fruitier and sweeter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it certainly wasn't hard to finish this brew! Not a bad beer overall, I liked it."
"D - So good, my favorite from this brewing co. by far. Enjoy, but don't let the ABV sneak up on you!"
"Overall, for me the question is always would I buy this again and drink it, and the answer is a definite yes."
"This is a well balanced, tasty Double IPA. I could easily drink a couple of these at one sitting. The aroma and flavor are interesting. It's not overly hopped and loaded with citrus like other double IPA's. Very well done!"
" Goes down very easy, I will buy this again. Bravo."
"Drinks: like capability. Gordon's isn't the best hoppy red I've ever had (that honor still belongs to Hop Head Red), but it'll do the trick. 4"
"Wow. Reeks of hops and smells like hops. I'm really a big fan of hops but if you're not ready or not in the mood this one will take you right in the hop direction. Had this on tap at the Irish Pol in Philly. $3 pint does not disappoint! Pours dark amber in color with hop resin-like lacing that really clings to the glass. Maybe a little too hopped as I mentioned earlier, but not at all bad for a second if you're a hophead. A really good beer, but not a whole, whole lot you can drink of in one night. The alcohol does hit the head and it is a palate cleanser. Don't get me wrong: I am a fan; just doesn't wow me."
"Mouthfeel - Is appropriate for the style, thin enough to go down easily, yet thick enough to remind you what you're drinking, which is important with a beer at 8.7 ABV."
"Notes: a little better on-tap, seems to be more sessionable"
"Very interesting brew.. craft beer in a can but a really good craft beer."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is good."
"And it tastes like it smells. Greenness pervades a see-saw that's juuust right, one kid a little fatter than the other but fatty's a good sport and he makes sure to be extra bouncy, so the ride is fair. (Jesus god in heaven I am hurting for beer metaphors). So, yeah, fat kids on a see-saw. The hops are fatter but they play fair. Everything is all creepy and green, like that little Sprout thing that hung out with the jolly green giant."
"I admit, I'm a bit surprised at how well this brew performed. And I'm even more surprised how my individual ratings added up, but I stand by my ratings. This beer is excellent."
"This is pretty good, but the alcohol is too high and it's a palate wrecker. Why not find one of the really good American IPAs? I can't enjoy two of these in a sitting without getting shnockered and I don't see any good reason for that."
"drink: very great, but with all high abv, dont have to many!"
"D- good stuff but in a world with more ipa's then you can shake a stick at its middle of the pack. Easy drinkin and enjoyable for sure just not my fav."
"Vey good drinkability for the almost 9% abv. This beer does not dissapoint, Oskar Blues does not dissapoint."
"Unlike the aroma of this beer, there is quite the malt backbone to this beer. Medium body, quite sweet up front, really strong bitterness in the back, could use some more hop flavors in the midpalate. Beer is pretty drinkable, overall a decent DIPA, especially for availability and price."
"this one is not too easy for me to drink. I guess I shouldnt say that. Its easy enough, but not overly enjoyable. The cloying sweetness does not accentuate the resiny hops, but they detract from each other in this one. A miss for me."
"A DIPA in a can is fantastic as it allows bigger styles to be available in this versatile container. The beer is big and bold with a strong malty backbone to anchor the hops. This is a well balanced DIPA that drinks easily but holds enough complexity to slow the drinker down. Pour it into a glass or the nose and the finish suffer( It's not PBR )"
"OB calls this a DIPA/Imperial Red and you get the best of both worlds from this. Great beer!"
"D: Maybe a little too strong in flavor and abv to drink too many, but I'd be willing to explore those boundaries."
" This is my new favorite after dinner, before a dessert beer! A great beer for hop lovers and read ale lovers alike. Not too bitter and not too sweet."
"D - The hops are noticeable and present, but at the same time, they don't beat you over the head. It's a great, medium-bodied, slightly hoppy, silky smooth, refreshing beer. It might be just a little too heavy for a hot, humid day, but this is perfect for spring weather or a pleasant summer eve. Goes well with burgers or just drinking on its own."
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and smooth. This is just a pleasure to drink. Highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable, almost too much so give the 8.7% (really?). Nice, very well balanced imperial red. I know it's classified as a DIPA, but the caramal malts remind of me a red more so than an IPA. I'll be picking this up again."
"355 ml can, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.7%. Amber colour, big off-white head with an orangey hue. Excellent complex aroma of American hops, notes of pine, oranges, grapefruit, tropical fruits. The flavour has loads of American hops from start to finish, with fruity (grapefruity), piney and resinous notes, but it is not too bitter (despite respectable 85 IBUs), as the hoppiness is nicely balanced by a sweetness of malts and orange marmalade. Resinous bitter aftertaste."
"D: This is more of a hoppy amber ale IMO but very tasty and easy to drink for a hop bomb. I would easily get this again."
"12oz can served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy reddish gold with a finger of off white head. Fragrant with piney hops and also some caramel malt. Medium bodied with a rich mouthfeel. Nice and malty with a good amount of hop bitterness to balance the sweetness out. Very drinkable for the ABV. Another solid beer from Oskar Blues."
"Overall this certainly is a hybrid of the DIPA and the Imperial Red. Another well done beer from Oskar Blues. Recommended."
"medium body, though some moments are lighter and thinner. syrupy feel at times, punctuated by moderate resins and light astringency. moderate carbonation gives tingle and some body."
"Blends very well with Red Hook or Bigfoot Ale (if you can sneak BF in w/ Gordon to the game). Very sticky, thick."
"Overall- a solid IPA with great flavor and aftertaste."
"O A good beer and a good IPA. A little sweeter than I like, but still a good beer. Definitely recommend."
"Pours from the can with a nice foamy head. The smell of hops wafts up and gives an indication of the flavor. Refreshing beer with a slighly malty, hoppy flavor. While hops are definitely present they are not overpowering. Overall a very drinkable beer. Excellent late summer night beer."
"On tap, poured into a pint glass at just below room temp. Exhibits a rich copper amber color. Very nice lacing but not great head formation or retention. Fresh and lively hops on the nose with just a hint of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel has a malty rich texture with a lighter than expected body and just the right amount of carbonation. Not super bitter but consistently hoppy across the palate with a very subdued and light malt. Its not a resiny as a lot of DIPAs but the hops are still the the star of the show, staying fresh and piny on the tongue. Overall I would say this one is just as drinkable as any good regular IPA while still packing the higher abv. A truly unsung gem in the double IPA world."
"The alcohol in this is hardly noticeable. A very very drinkable pint. Any flaws (too heavy in the hop and not enough malt) are minor. I never buy stuff from these guys...maybe it is the can stigma -- but that is gonna change. Drink this."
"Dispite the malt intensity and hop smash, it's surprisingly refreshing!"
"D: A good beer with a very good nose and good flavor that, unfortunately, also has a distracting, lingering alcoholic feel that encourages another drink (to get the damn alcohol flavor out of the mouth). So far, this is the best beer I have had from OB."
"Tasty, and pretty unique without being a shock to the palate. Still falls short of other Oskar Blues brews such as Ten Fidy, Old Chub, and Gubna."
"D: The alcohol is well-hidden so it's relatively easy to drink. Who would have thought that something that tasted this good could come out of a can?"
"Another quality and unique brew from the boys at Oskar Blues. Keep up the great work!"
"Value: Not much of one; I paid $3.85 for one can."
"At six months old, I don't expect it to be at its best, but this is already only a shadow of what I expect fresh Gordon to be. Will seek out a better sample in the future and re-review."
"Poured from can to pint glass on 3/29. Amber in color topped with huge 3 finger white head after a heavy pour. Smells of earthy, citrus, hops, slightly bitter in the nose with light malt notes. The taste is the same with a tiny bit of fruity-ness. Alcohol is well hidden but has a slight heat in the finish. Medium to full body and perfectly carbed. Very drinkable but hops can fatigue pallet."
"I gave this bonus points in the drinkability. Again, I go back to the commendable balance. It is a heavy beer, but smooth and the abv doesn't even show up close to 8.7%. In fact, I went back and looked at the can after seeing this was posted as 8.7% on BA. Yep, it sure is."
"D: An extremely drinkable Imperial IPA."
"The Gordan ale pours an amber color with a very frothy cream colored head and plenty of lacing on the glass. Aromas are subtly, but pleasant. Most dominant characteristics are the caramel malts with a hop backbone. No pine is noticed but some citrus fruits come through. Taste is some hops with some raisins. Not the taste I was expecting. A funky alcoholic finish that I can't pinpoint. Not sure on the freshness of this brew but would think it isn't extremely fresh. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and silky. Drinkability is pretty high. Hard to compare with other DIPA but solid nonetheless."
"D: While it is a fairly decent beer, I'd be hard pressed to drink this one quickly, or drink more than one. It doesn't seem very balanced, and the hops just don't resonate with me. Plus it's quite bitter. C'est la vie."
"Note: Reviewing the packaging, it turns out this can is from 12-09-09. Today being 4/18/10, if anybody thinks my opinion of the beer was hampered by its semi-lack of freshness shoot me a bm, I'd definitely be down to have another one of these, and give it a new review while I'm at it."
"Reddish-amber with a solid, creamy off-white head that leaves some patchy lace. Tropical, fruity, and floral hop stickiness in the nose. Ripe grapefruit pulp, mango, cedar, and pine resin, over a sweet caramel base. Big, resinous hop oils flood the tongue with bitter goodness. Citrus peel and sap. A heavy caramel sweetness balances things out as well as it can. Pretty rich overall. Just a wee bit of alcohol warmth. Medium bodied, oily, and bitter with some grittiness. Good stuff."
"Pretty sweet, but the hops really balance things out. Sticky overall - solid notes of caramel and hops. Smooth, full, thick, and terrific. For this Imperial style, Gordon. is well within his rights to be this hoppy, but the balance really stands out from the crowd. Fine beer."
"Drinkability is good. Unique tasting IPA, with a well-hidden alcohol presence."
"Overall Impression: Another Uber Good beer from Oskar Blues. I have yet to have a beer from them that was not in the upper echelon for the style."
"Got damn, love this beer! On draft- absolute domination. Served with a great foamy frothy light tan/ cream colored head with a load of lace. Aroma is like fine fresh weed. Color is a clear red oak amber. Flavor's like aroma but so much more. Not too much if the citrus department, more earthy. Killer body and carbonation. Excellent finish - bittersweet. Man, this beer is so good."
"SkÅL!"
"D-A little sweeter than I would have liked, but a great beer. Being from a can this beer moves up on my drinkability chart. I will be saving the rest of my stash to take to the Indy 500 next month. I don't think you can beat this flavor with any other canned beer. Well other than Ten Fidy."
"gravity brew."
"D- Perfect. I could drink this every night as an after work tipple, Relaxing and more complex than I expected. Just a damn drinkable beer."
"Oskar Blues ceases to amaze me with their big beers in a can. When I was first introduced to their beers, I though it was a joke. But, they have proved me wrong. They make some fine ales, and they are prefect travel companions for camping trips, gold outings, and coasting down the river in a canoe. Gordon Ale is no exception."
"drinkability - this is a solid imperial ipa, it's very drinkable for 8.7 abv"
"This is a drinkable beer. The 8.7 percent ABV does sneak up on you. The taste is maltier than most DIPAs I've had, but it works."
"Mr. Knight's peeps at Oskar Blues did him proud with this one. The can doesn't lie, Gordon is Big, Red, and Sticky (I'd add Sweet on the end of that). A very flavorful, sweet, hoppy, yet balanced beer that is a very interesting take on the DIPA style. If I had my way, I'd back off the malt a little and add more hops, but I can certainly appreciate this beer and its amazing drinkability, as I'm having trouble putting it down long enough to write this. If you have the chance, pick this up and give it a try. Gordon won't disappoint."
"D - This beer is amazing on-tap, it is not nearly as good in the can. But is still pretty damn tasty. Recommendable, for sure."
"I wasn't expecting a whole lot especially since I really didn't care for Ol' Chubb despite all the reviews. This was a big surprise and unusually light considering the ABV. It disappeared so quickly I wish I had another!"
"nice and thick, smooth and sippable."
"Drinkability: For an imperial red/IPA, it's very drinkable because it is so smooth and has such a clean finish. This beer is not recommended for people who claim to """not like hoppy beers""""
"Notes: Oskar Blues has some interesting beers, they tend to avoid the status quo and turn their beers into something else, something different. I'm going to rate this beer as impartially as possible and judge it on it's qualities rather than on it's company (ie ruination, double simcoe, double trouble, etc). No matter how it ranks up against those, overall I'lll be picking this up."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Good amount of carbonation and a decently high abv. It's smooth and sweet...sweeter than most other DIPAs. Nice balance of hops and malt but it's a bit too sweet for me to keep drinking all night. Quite tasty, though."
"D: Highly drinkable for a DIPA. I'd love to have this on tap."
"This is a seriously good """Imperial Red/Double IPA""" and I wish cans of this were distributed to Maine."
"Clear, dark amber color. Thin white head that quickly collars but paints some impressive lace regardless. Reeks of tropical C hops and Gran Marnier. Taste is similar tropical fruit hard candy with sweet, sweet malt. Some one went crazy with the caramel though I get hints of chocolate here and there. Resiny mouthfeel makes me feel like I'm chewing on whole hop cones...and that's a good thing. Too sweet to order another."
"A highly hopped red ale. A little high in alcohol for the style, which constrains its drinkability. Nevertheless, a tasty effort overall."
"Finally scored a fresh one. I had to dig underneath what was on display and found this canned just last month. It was worth the trouble but not sure if it is my type of DIPA. Still worth buying when you are tired of the typical DIPA taste."
"Pours from the 12 oz. can (CAN? yes, can) a lovely dark amber color with a thick, pillowy 2 finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thick collar and leaves a sticky lacing on the glass as it subsides. Aroma is of sweet citrus-y hops (grapefruit, lemon and maybe a hint of pineapple?) There is active carbonation, but the bubbles seem smaller than usual. 1st sip brings a hoppiness mixed with malt sweetness. The hops tend to win out, but there is a VERY nice balance. There's a strong pine-y finish and the aftertaste coats the tongue & lingers for a long wile. Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy without being heavy, and I could drink these babies all day (or night) long! The wording on the can says this ale is """Big. Red. Sticky.""". and that pretty much nails it! Took me a while to find this here in PA, but the search was well worth it! I'll definetly add Oskar Blues to my list of favorite breweries, and plan to sample more of their lineup VERY soon!!!"
"Gordon's mouthfeel is really smooth, leaving the mouth well hydrated if not a little puckered from bitterness. Overall, I'm not left raving about Gordon, but it seems like a decent DIPA."
"Pours deep amber with a small white head. I could smell the beer the second I popped the tap. Earthy hops and sweet malt. The taste follows. Bold earthy hops, caramel malt, pretty sweet. Mouthfeel is sticky, thick, and a bit warming. I worked on this one for a while and as it warmed it became stickier, sweeter, and boozier. Again, I just wish this available here, I would certainly buy it all the time. I think its more of an imperial amber/red than DIPA though. That's even how its characterized on Oskar Blues website and the can """Big. Sticky. Red.""""
"this beer is a bit too sweet for me. considering the abv, it is well-balanced and blends into the beer. looking forward to drinking the rest of the 4-pack but my first impression is the drinkability suffers from the sweetness"
"Mouthfeel is medium full but has a smooth amount of carbonation that gives a lush feel to it."
"As soon as I cracked open the can I could smell the hops. Poured into an Allagash chalice. First thing I noticed was how much more red this beer was then most in the style (Oskar Blues labels this beer as an Imperial Red/Double IPA). Good bit of white sandy colored head that is already leaving trails of lace. The hop smell is thick, pungent, pine forest, good citrus balance. The taste is a cascade of hops, but cut off quickly mid palate by a good caramel malt flavors. However the hops soon take over and coat the entire back of the mouth. It is very sticky, bitter, dry and great. Carbonation is maintained throughout as well as head retention. Even with the stickiness of the hops, it is not syrupy and has a quick overall finish. This is an underrated DIPA, as I think Ten-Fidy gets so much of the spotlight from Oskar Blues. Can't wait for the GUBNA, which should be an amped version of this beer."
"D: A good, but not great DIPA. As with Ten Fidy, it's awesome that it comes in a can and still tastes good, but overall it's not as strong an offering. I would have no problem drinking it again, however."
"D - Quite easy drinking, clean, and certainly enjoyable. A nice take on the style with more malt and less syrup than some other examples. Another solid brew from Oskar Blues with their own signature take... I would expect nothing less."
"drinkability: one of the best beers at their no one matter what you categorize it."
"D: One of those beers that is better than the sum of its parts. Everything works together nicely. It was a lovely dessert after spicy Indian food around the corner."
"Medium carbonated while being medium bodied. Definitely more syrupy on the tongue than oily. Despite the flaws, Gordon is very drinkable."
"definetly have to explore deeper into this oskar blues brews."
"Deep amber - 2 finger off-white head falls to skim. Nice lacing. Big smell - Pine, caramel. Big and bold and balanced. Taste is of hops up front - piney then the sweet malt comes in with a lingering bitterness left on the tongue. Medium body, a little oily. Very nice carbonation, smooth yet it has a little prickle. Overall a very nice DIPA."
" ~ My special thanks go out to my great friend Drizzam for his generous offering. My only complaint about the overall drinkability of this beer is that I don't have another one to follow this one. This is a very good beer, but, I will say that I'm not sure I could do more than one in a sitting. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm just sayin'."
"5/1/2013 NOTE: Just had this out of the can again and this is a damn good beer; the strong hops and biscuity backbone work almost perfectly, making this one of the best red ales on the planet. An excellent hybrid beer that always delivers."
"Drinkability is great. Downing these would be very easy, but the 8.7 ABV turns this into a very good sipper."
"Gordon, I think you and I are going to be good friends."
"D-for a brew with an 8.7% abv this is extremely drinkable. Highly recommender, better off tap than its canned brother."
"Notes: Quite a notable DIPA on a can. It had been a while since I had had this one, and I did not remember it this good. Maintains a distinct Oskar Blues malty and sweet note over a rather complex hoppy profile."
"D: easy sipper, drank it sort of slow due to other distrations"
"Overall: Very good representation of the style. This is proof that good beer can come in a can. I would highly recommend it."
"Libation: Is this really 8.7% ABV? Surprisingly smooth and refreshing despite DIPA style and ABV. It leans toward the malty side, but it's not as thick and syrupy as other malty DIPAs, (the DFH 90 Minute for example). One of the more refreshing and smooth DIPAs I've ever had. A great offering from Oskar Blues, too bad these are only available via trades."
"Notes: A very good beer, and I wouldn't expect anything less from Oskar Blues. The juicy hops and caramel malt are what make this beer. It's just so easy to drink."
"D: Glad this beer comes in 4-packs. Quality and quantity control. Very drinkable DIPA, fantastic flavor combined with a great mouthfeel. Clean and refreshing."
"+ like it says on the can, it's 'Big. Red. Sticky' yep. sounds about right. the alcohol is well hidden. it's a great DIPA. possibly one of the better ones i've had."
"D: Very nice beer. So much so that my cup is empty and must be filled again."
"D - Definately liked it and would drink again"
"Not super drinkable due to the strong notes of alcohol. Good though."
"Pours a reddish brown with an off-white head. The aroma is strong citrus hops with some pine. The flavor is grapefruit, pine and orange. The orange is much stronger than the last times I have tried this beer, with a strong pithy orange flavor being dominant. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"This is a very underrated(at least neglected when it comes to top DIPA discussions)beer. This IS a world class DIPA period.(and from a can no less, haha)"
"Overall - Good beer, not amazing - I need to review it fresh though."
"Hazed orange amber with a thick, creamy sand colored head of dense foam that leaves plenty of crusty lace behind on the glass. This brew smells huge, tons of caramel malt and tons of fresh pungent citrusy hoppiness. Big gobs of caramel malty sweetness balances well with grapefruity bittering hops and a touch of brown sugar. A little bit maltier than I normally prefer but there is no denying this is a great beer. Full bodied and creamy with a hop oily finish. Amazingly drinkable if the listed ABV is true. Good stuff."
"Very nice copperish amber color with somewhat low carbonation and a fairly stable head. Smell is of citrus hops and plenty of caramel sweetness. Taste is quite unique quite sweet with pineapple and citrus notes. Lots of caramel malt flavor, and not necessarily a ton of bitterness. Some toasty malt notes add nice depth, but I am really having a hard time with all the sweetness. Medium body with a pretty sticky finish. Not all that drinkable for a double IPA. I am a fan of Oskar Blues but I have to say I am a little disappointed in this one."
"Drinkability: Just a great beer. Sort of an imperial red ale mixed with a DIPA. Huge malts and huge hops makes a really nice beer."
"Smell and taste is quite nice i must say. Its good and nothing more and nothing less. The M and D is also very good, the mouthfeel is smooth and not even close to being unpleasant."
"Drinkability: I enjoy a good DIPA and this is certainly one of them; nice, warm, and chewy with great flavors -- I don't know if I could drink too many in a sitting due to the sweetness or ABV, but I will most definitely seek this one out again if I get the opportunity."
""""Big Red Sticky""" says it all. A juicy hoppy resinous """Can-O-Bliss.""" Balanced just enough. And still holds its freshness beautifully in the can. Second biggest beer in a can I've had next to Ten FIDY. Watch out, the Booze will sneak up on you."
"D- This is a retardedly good beer. I wish Oskar Blues would come to Indiana already. If I could get them I would be happy forever. This beer was more than I could have hoped for and am looking to trade for more here soon."
"D: Quite good. I am becoming a fan of this style.. Very nice, well rounded beer, and something I would get again if it became available to me."
"D - This is very different for a DIPA. The malt is dark and sweet; so much so that it almost comes across as a barleywine. The hop character is a bit weak for the style with a good level of bitterness and flavor but surprisingly little aroma. The herb/spice character is strange and unexpected, but not unpleasant. There is a great tea-like quality that took me a while to identify as well as some other unusual herbal characteristics. As a DIPA it is kind of weird and lacking in hop character, but it is still worth trying."
"Close to two fingers of nicely whipped up froth, not so dense thus only decent retention, rich tan color, thin lacing streaks but persistent. Cherry red wood, just short of mahogany, copper orange nearer the rims, while transparent there is a gauziness to it. Not the most powerfully penetrating nose yet does not lack for richness in the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus department, wet pine cones, splash of pepper and salt, then pineapple, nectarine, mango fruit scents which are more clear and direct than juicy, juicy, little to be said about the malt side of the equation. Medium-bodied, comes across as a bit stern and could """give""" a little more. More floral, good accompaniment to the grapefruit, orange citrus, the latter drier here. The carbonation has a fine sandpapery grit to it, helps it adhere to your mouth pores. Same can be said for the pine element, the apricot, nectarine, pineapple fruit slightly syrupy as well. If there's any cocoa or chocolate powder, it must be on the bittersweet side and thus can't separate from the rest. Finishes semi-abruptly."
"D-extremely impressed, very good beer. love the taste, hides the alcohol well, and is extremely smooth!"
"D: This is a great beer in my opinion. I will say that I had it on draft 1-2 months ago and enjoyed it a little more, but I'm glad to have it readily available in my fridge right now"
"D: this is a delicious double IPA. This is the third beer I've tried from Oskar Blues and they are all delicious. The abv is hidden behind the well balanced hops and malts. This one is a winner"
"D- Real pleasant to drink, this will be great in the spring and summer, 8.7% ABV hides itself well"
"Came out a reddish orange, one finger off white head. Smell: sweet, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruit. Taste: much the same, sweet caramel, pineapple, pine. Very balanced, maybe too much so. Kind of middle of the road of """good""" dipas. Wasn't super impressed, but will try this again in cans."
"Really a beautiful one - the best beer in a can in the world!"
"Overall, i was impressed with this canned beer. For a DIPA is leans a lot more towards the malty spectrum. I definitely prefer more of a hop bite but i can't really say to much negative about it. Its smooth crisp and tasty. I would recommend this one to anybody and would definitely drink it again."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Very nice balance in a flavorful beer with a rich mouthfeel."
"Overall an interesting DIPA-not particularly what I was expecting. I agree with what others say regarding it being a bit amber ale-like in quality. Quite nice."
"Note: Have to assume that OB tweaked the recipe for this beer since I last had it in 2007. This beer was vastly superior, I thought, to what I tried back then."
"One sip and this became one of my favorites. Will be buying this again, no questions asked, when I can find it. By far the best from Oskar Blues."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Poors a beautiful amber color with a good two inch head. The aroma is very floral with lots of grapefruit and pine, backed by sweet caramel malts. This beer has an amazing mouthfeel, very full and luscious, super smooth. The flavor is full of fresh hops, with lots of grapefruit, notes of pine, and slightly floral. All of this backed up by sweet caramel malts. A very balanced beer, the hops are balanced perfect by the malty sweetness. Great beer overall!"
"Very good beer, could definitely enjoy a few of them however after two or three might have to change over to something less."
"d: this beer is so smooth i could drink it all night but would catch up to me after 3 or 4"
"Delicious big beer. Not just a hop monster like some IIPAs. Definitely some amber ale qualities here. Gordon should be proud. The question is: how do I get a beer this good named after me?"
"Oskar Blues Gordon is a clear, dense, copper ale with a foamy, chunky, yellowish sand colored head that has rainbow bubbles. The head retention and lacing are outstanding. The aroma is very strong. As soon as the can is popped, you can smell it across the room: grassy, floral, spicy, citrusy and fresh. It's velvety smooth and pretty full bodied. The finish is clean and delicate. It's well balanced; not terribly bitter, but very hoppy. There are flavor notes of grass, flowers and citrus peel. The alcohol flavor waxes to provide the finish and a long, hot aftertaste. Wow. It's really bold."
"Had this on tap at Flying Saucer. Poured a golden brown with a one finger creamy light caramel head. Nose was caramel malt, spruce notes and orange peel. Lots more caramel malt in the taste with a finish of ripe pink grapefruit and pineapple rind. The mouthfeel is very smooth, wet and mellow. I didn't like this on tap as much as I did out of the can-maybe a poor pour by the bartender but the experience wasn't the same. Still a good beer but I would like more hops. I realize the malt bill on this example is supposed to be prevalent but that is the case with DFH 90 as well and the malt character is very noticeable but doesn't overpower the hops like this one does. Mild bitterness in the finish, it could use some more hop character. Still think the bartender screwed the pour up, I'll have to give it another shot on tap down the road."
"I would recommend this beer to those hopheads out there. It is different to be pouring a good beer from a can, but it works and tastes good."
"Overall another very good beer. Maybe a little subdued for a DIPA but worthy for seeking out."
"D: quite high given the abv (mainly because of the perceived dryness of this beer."
"Overall impression: Overrated (and underhopped)? Old can? Hard to say with no date info on the can, but I won't be purchasing this again unless I see it on tap somewhere."
"Drinkability is great! This beer goes down quite easy and is pretty tasty. I certainly wouldn't mind having this as a session beer and look forward to having many more. If you see this in a store, definitely give it a try!"
"D: The sweetness downgrades the drinkability, but only slightly. It's a great beer."
"This is a world class DIPA in my opinion, and I've had many many versions of this style from all over. Definitely one of the best I have tried, just in your face hop flavor but no alcohol taste. I'm going to compare DIPAs I try in the future to this one, it's that good. I am definitely going to be trying any Oskar Blues beers I can get my hands on. Never knew canned beer could be so delicious."
"This is good DIPA with lots of well balanced flavor. It's a bit pricey for regular consumption though."
"Poured this into a pint glass. A very hazy deep orange color. Very little head retention. It smells very nice with a lot of hoppy fruitiness going on, and a bit of sweet malts. This beer tastes excellent, and it's very balanced. Strong on the hops, but not at all over the top with a really nice candy-like flavor from the interplay between the hops and malts. Pretty good drinkability too, it's hard to tell this beer is 8.7% abv."
"Overall, a great beer bordering on excellent. Worth seeking out."
"Reddish body with a decent head. Aroma is a delightful overload of citrusy hops. However, the malt is surprisingly assertive in the flavor. The caramel maltiness mixes well with the grapefruity hop bitterness. In terms of overall profile, I'd place this somewhere between Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale and Stone 13th Anniversary. I like both of those beers quite a bit, and I like this one as well."
"d- the drinkability is suprising me here, i thought it would be less so, but i could have a few of these, glad i have another in the cellar, this is another top notch canned craft beer."
"i give it 9 north austin gold tokens."
"these were canned 10/08/09 so there super fresh and it just makes me curious as to what six months or so would do to this...a stellar imperial red..."
"Drinks very easy. Tremendously enjoyable in every aspect. This would definitely be one I would pick up semi regularly if available in Michigan. Fantastic brew, and those who have regular access should feel lucky."
"very easy to drink for a DIPA. hops are not over done and the flavors just pull you in."
"I would buy this every day if i had the money :)."
"As far as DIPA/IIPA's go, this is quite the drinkable monster. I understand it's popularity now and consider myself a fan of it, also."
"Very full aroma, loaded with sweet malt, crisp fresh hops, and a slight bite of alcohol spice. This is a walloper of an iipa in the taste, with a full sticky and chewy resinous palate-filling body. Some over-ripe fruit in here too, with lots of chewy malt. It manages the high abv well, deceptively so. I really liked this iipa, and the 12oz can is perfect to help retain my sobriety. A tasty above average imperial pale ale, and that's saying something coming from my experience and geographic locale!"
"Gordon is a flawless beauty. Perfect features, with no blemishes and nothing out of place. I prefer imperfect, offbeat beauty; however, because imperfections provide character. I would be content having Gordon every day, as my go-to ale, but I'd eventually grow bored and crave some funk."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium in body with perfect carbonation, making Gordon go down surprisingly easy for it's near nine percent."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable!"
"D - This was a very nice DIPA...it has a big ABV but as I said the alcohol only shines through a little and overall this is a very drinkable beer...a decent balance of flavors with a wonderful nose"
"Immediately I get a fruity sweetness, in part derived from the malts, but at the same time registering as lots of juicy hops on my tongue. Lots of kumquats, tropical goodness. A nice pine bitterness then sneaks up for a sticky finish, which lasts for a while and ends up slightly biscuity and floral somehow, which begs me to go back to the beginning of the flavor experience. One of my favorite hoppy red ales, much prefer this to the """imperial ambers""" that have become popular. Medium body with a moderate-high carbonation that works with the bite that the hops deliver. A really tasty all around beer, it looks expensive for a can of beer, but in reality it is pretty reasonably priced when compared to many imperial IPAs that are on the market. Recommended."
"D- Drinkable as hell but for the price i'd go for Dale's Pale over this one. A must try though."
"Drinkability - Are you serious...this has 8.7% ABV? Do not give me a four pack of these when I am in front of the television or they will be gone in thirty minutes without me even realizing. This is an extremely drinkable and enjoyable beer. The past few months I had been striking out in DIPAs in my opinion and just recently I have come across three I enjoy besides PtE. This makes me very happy!"
"Oskar Blues is becoming my favorite brewery. Every brew I have from them is a fine example of the particular style. This one ranks up there with DFH 90 and Hop Stoopid as my easily acquirable favorite DIPAs. It's definitely different than the others with more pine which is a good change of pace."
"D: A flavorful DIPA. The flavor mostly comes from the malts however. This is a bit different that most DIPAs I've really enjoyed. When I'm more in the mood for maltiness, this is the DIPA I will choose."
"O: This beer is all about hops. For those who enjoy hops, you will find this a good DIPA. Not exceptional, but good."
"I know I've had this one on-tap before, but only recently realized I haven't reviewed it yet, oh well. On-tap in my own personal kegorator poured into a DFH signature glass a crisp red with a nice frothy eggshell head. Aroma is a nice balance of crisp citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste is a nice blend of sweet caramel malts and citrus and pine hops with a nice lingering balanced finish. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This one is very enjoyable on tap, one I'll certainly put in the kegorator again."
"D: Fantastic! A big juicy DIPA that is so easy to drink and is very refreshing."
"4.5 D: I would definitely like to have this been again, but not too often since it's quite expensive."
"D: Such an easy drinking DIPA. It's more malty and sweet than I generally like (I'm not sure how old it is), but great flavors and nothing unpleasant."
"D- Lots of hops and lots of malt are a pleasure... in small doses. I thoroughly enjoyed this can of Gordon, and could probably enjoy another... but I cannot see myself getting past two cans before the sweetness is too cloying and/or the hop bitterness becomes overpowering."
"The mouthfeel is full without being heavy. The alcohol could be hidden a bit better, but still a great imperial red nonetheless."
"Notes: Boy, I really wish I knew how old this can was. I can't help but wonder if this beer is just past its prime, or if the beer just simply isn't within my realm of what I would consider tasty beer. It didn't look very impressive at all, it's waaaay too sweet, not nearly hoppy enough, and the chocolate malts just seemed really out of place. Now, do you see why freshness dates are so important? If I knew this beer was old, I wouldn't review it. But with no way of telling, I have no clue if that is a factor or not. As is, I have to review the beer sitting in front of me, and the beer sitting in front of me is not very good at all. But, since they make one of the best IRS's (Ten Fidy), I will have to track down a can that I know for a fact is fresh and update the review, just to give them the benefit of the doubt. As is, though, not recommended."
"12 oz can poured into a snifter glass produced an amber colored beer with a 1 1/2 finger head. The smell consisted of pine, dark fruit and malt. At first I wasn't sure what to think of this beer as it was a little to sweet for my taste. But as the beer warmed up it allowed the hops to come through. At 8.7 percent you can't taste the alcohol. This is a pretty well balanced beer. I would try again if I could ever find it on tap."
"Served in a tulip. Poured a hazy orange-brown with a quarter inch off-white head that dissipated into a skim. Thin, delicate bands of lacing were formed during the course of the tasting, displaying good adherence. Nose was incredible - sweet grapefruit and light, fruity esters; perhaps a touch of honey. Not much in terms of hops (resinous, piny or medicinal) detectable in the nose. Taste consistent with nose, but the lightest kiss of hops bittering is detectable at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a light, consistent background carbonation present. Drinkability is excellent with an extremely well-hidden abv; beats the can hands down."
"Reddish orange copper color, big white floral aroma laced head, heavy lacing left behind. Alcohol at time no noticeable whatsoever. A well controlled DIPA...a hop monster with manners. Doesn't quite have the over-the-top intense bitterness which leaves the taste buds burnt. No grapefruit bitterness...much more floral with a massive malt depth. Its a really nice beer."
"Looks great, nice head, still made to drink from the can IMO. It raises the score a tad."
"Overall: Pretty drinkable at a colder temp. These really thick malty IPA's aren't really my fav, but colder they go down easier. It's definitely above average especially in smell+appearance, but imo, taste isn't too exciting. Still drinkable (for a malty ipa lover)"
"D - For the ABV, this is a dangerously drinkable beer. I think they call it a double IPA but it seems more like an imperial red to me with the rich maltiness."
"This is sticky, thick mouth/stomach/intestine coating goodness! I love Oskar Blues so much, I would subscribe to their newsletter."
"Excellent DIPA! worth picking up a 4 pack anytime you want a great session beer.makes me want to go night streaking after a put down a quad! Looks like liquid caramel in a glass with a floating biscuit on top. How can you not want to try this beer????"
"D - Gordon slides right down. This is one of the best examples of massive hops coupled with sweet malt that I've had the pleasure of drinking. Great all around without being too harsh, hot, or bitter. Glad to see it in the area now."
"I've actually just started seeing this around this area, so I'll have to grab a 'fresh' can and see how it compares, but a few months on this bad boy has done it no harm. Recommend."
"Cheers!"
"Great beer!"
"D - I like this one a lot. The canned double IPA is very appealing."
"Great beer by Oskar Blues and theres no can flavor at all. Another vote for more craft beer in cans."
"I'll have another sometime I guess."
"Beautifully drinkable DIPA; big on both malt & hops, yet none outshines the other and they exist in perfect harmony. If not for the high alcohol content, I could down these one after the other."
"M/D: Slightly under-carbonated despite a quite impressive head. Sticky malts and a smooth finish, texture is somewhere right in the middle. Complexity, texture, and taste combine to make this an enjoyable beer, but in my mind, this is much more of a red ale than it is a Double IPA. I would have thought that maybe the keg had been sitting for a while, but the nose quickly dispelled that notion. I would say it is not great for a DIPA, but as a red ale, it is very good."
"This beer really doesn't drink like a DIPA, as the alcohol isn't remotely perceptible, and there's far greater balance between the hopping and malt than you would usually find in the style. Without knowing the ABV in advance I would have called this sessionable. Shows what I know!"
"Possibly not as good as the can version, Gordon is still a very good. More of an alcohol taste on draft, the color is still very good, the aroma is great and it does have a great taste. Drinkability is not as satisfying because it was a little hot for me but it is still a standout double india pale ale."
"J"
"This is a fantastic brew from Oskar Blues."
"Overall, this beer is so great it's hard to justly describe it. Put it on your must try list."
"EDIT: 10/16/12 - Tasted on draft at the brewery during GABF 2012. Not as memorable as foregoing experience 3 years ago. Gave it a 3.5 at best this time around, on draft"
"The nose was great. I though at first this was going to be a well balanced and flavorful DIPA. Though for some reason, what ever balance that was in the nose is pretty much gone in the flavor. What is left is just bland bitterness. Not something I will get again."
"This is a damn good, beer, so glad i bought a 4 pack and not just a single."
"Decent drinkability..."
"smell was very floral/citrusy hop. A person 3 feet away comented on the rich nose. Taste was much more subdued with the perfect balance of hop and malt. Like old chub and dales pale ale made sweet sweet love. strong sweet and smooth followed by a pleasent bitter. Its what Ive been looking for so long."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Bottom of the can says it was canned 1-28-09. Very little notice of carbonation after the pour. Little or no aroma. Body is somewhat heavy limiting drinkable nature. The booze is very warming. I guess I think this missed the mark a little bit. I love that Oskar Blues cans there beer."
"D) Another? Most definitely. Wow! This is on my all time list."
"Drinkability is pretty good - moderate hop flavor but low to moderate hop bitterness, and a nice, full-bodied malt character make this one easy to drink."
"D- excellent DIPA with big bold flavors that never overpower"
"A good beer that refuses to allow the malts or hops to dominate- they seem to take turns at every sip."
"D: Can't usually have more than one, but it is a solid beer. I usually prefer citrusy hops for imperial IPAs, but this is a good representative for the other camp."
"Great drinkability. Well hidden alcohol, goes down way too easy. A nice lower alcohol DIPA as well. Another great beer from a can."
"D- This is one of the sweetest and most well balanced DIPAs that I've had. The bitterness is present but kept in check with a nice sweetness. Easily drinkable, almost too drinkable given the high ABV."
"Pours a hazy orange, smell is strong with a mixture of floral perfume and a bit of a orange citrus and mango fruitiness. Taste is nice and hoppy, predominately floral but there is that same sort of citrus and fruitiness coming through in the taste as well. Body is medium, slick but not too much so. I would enjoy this more in smaller portions."
"Drinkabily is extremely high for a DIPA - I'm pretty sure that if presented with a 6 pack, I'd succumb to its intoxication by #5... don't be a statistic!"
"D: I was very impressed with this beer. A double red/IPA that is both interesting and perfectly blended together. This brewery continues to blow my mind with the quality and affordability of canned beers they are putting out. Could be interesting to get a six pack of these and see what happens."
"D- Well balanced with a good combination of sweet, bitter, acid (from carbonation) and mouth feel. The alcohol is well hidden."
" D - I was surprised by how much I liked this compared to the can. A potent and mouth coating but not cloying beer. It is really drinkable for the strength/style. I consider this high on the list and will drink it any time I see it on tap"
"I love this. Will buy again."
"Drinkability is superb. This goes down like a session beer and then you feel it. Just wonderful on tap or in the growler. Seek it out whenever possible."
"I definitely recommend drinking this guy as fresh as possible, but it is still great with SOME age on it. Definitely a fan of OB now...not that I was questioning my loyalty or anything."
"D--I won't be buying a sixer of this any time soon. Maybe mine was out of date, but I doubt it. Just an average beer overall."
"D - Oh yeah. This one is not going to be around very long."
"Pours a clear medium amber that has some nice glowing edges and has a creamy slightly off-white head slowly dissolves into a nice thin layer around and atop the glass. The aroma has a sticky resinous hop bouquet that is accompanied by some brown sugar but still is dominated by the hops. The flavor is sweet candy up front with some sweet hops and brown sugar. The sweet bitterness lingers for sometime after each drink. Gordon is a light to medium bodied beer with light carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic and it leads you to believe that the flavor would have much of the same, which it doesn't. A little let down by that but overall it is still a pretty good drink."
"D - This beer is not a session beer, though it does want you to think so. It is highly drinkable, but the boozy notes are there, as is the ABV. It is, however, a treat, and a beer Lyons, CO and the rest of the US Craft Brew enthusiasts should take great pride in. Makes me proud to be 'Merican!"
"D: Out of all of Oskar Blue ales, this one is probably my favorite. It drinks really well out of the can, and it does have a great hop flavor to it. Great beer."
"pours an dark amber color with a smallish head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring.. the smell is faint to me for a dipa im not smelling the spice the citrus the pine..the taste is the same all faint and just not enjoyable its just not their .. dales pale ale is awesome so i was looking forward to this one as it is one of my favorite styles.. all aspect of this iipa were so thin and faint i was very dissapointed ..i will chalk this up to i must of had a bad /old can and will try again and edit this review..im going to go have my last founders double trouble after this one"
"Red in color or perhaps a red amber. Thick frothy head of about 2 cm that is a cream or beige color. Decent hops presence in the nose and a smooth malty undertone that the hops are riding on. Hoppy attack that quickly gives way to a sweet malty flavor before finishing hoppy and sweet. Something in the nose and flavor makes me think of brook trout. A little bit of a boozy turn at the finish that appears to come from the big malt body. A somewhat thick beer in the mouth. I really enjoyed this initially, but as I continue to drink it there is a """tinny""" flavor that really is distracting me from enjoying the other components. There are sensations upon finish that are like spice and warmth."
"If you can get a growler fill of this, do so by all means!!!!"
"Overall: A very good DIPA/IIPA, perhaps a shade below my favorite DFH 90 and some of Stone's offerings, yet in a different sort of class, less malty/hoppy extremeness and better integrated perhaps resulting in a superior DIPA. I'm a huge fan of the style, and this one has definitely got my attention. Definitely recommended to DIPA fans."
"Overall a pretty good DIPA Lots of pine hop flavor and a base that can support it."
"D: Astoundingly underrated, in my opinion. Priced fairly well, drinks smoothly, and it's relatively easily found around here. I'm definitely getting more of this."
"This beer pours a deep copper color, a big 2 finger pillowy white head. Great retention on the head and leaves thick lacing on the glass. Nose is piney and grassy hop aroma, with some grapfruit detectable, a muted malt backbone, and a touch of alcohol. Taste is like the aroma, big grassy hops up front, slight citrus, orange, nice maltiness in the middle with the finish being made up of big piney hops, not much alcohol detected in the taste though. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, long bitter aftertaste and goes down smooth. This is a great DIPA - does it big, but not too big, well balanced and highly drinkable."
"D - Extremely drinkable for almost 9%. Not too heavy and has a lot of great flavors. Another very solid brew from Oskar Blues that I will definitely return to."
"a very complete beer would definitely recommend and try again."
"Served in a tulip glass."
"Had a long week at work and had to deal with the HOA this week. So, I picked up a four-pack of these. I'm three deep and this IPA is absolutely delicious. Like the can says, it's red and sticky and does not disappoint. Pours a copper color with a strong head. Smell is citrusy and floral. Taste is hoppy, citrusy, piney with a strong malt backbone that is not overpowering. Overall, an excellent IPA. Kudos Oskar Blues."
"The balance good carbonation and smooth body make for a great tasty IPA. Oskar blues always one to impress. Maybe the most balanced IPA I've had."
"D- I think I could put a few of these away with ease. Gonna have to get me some more of this one."
"Pours a deep cloudy dark amber on the border of being red with wonderful head and minimal lacing. Smells of piny, sticky, and citrusy hops. Tastes bitter, malty, sweet, crisp, just a perfect balance on the palate. Mouthfeel is pleasantly full and creamy. Drinkability is incredible. This beer is so sticky and full and bitter I can't get enough of it."
"Orange and red, pretty clear, but pretty dark tinted. Head is big and pillowy, lots of lacing. smell is citrus. pure citrus heaven. some bready or leather notes too. taste is grapefruity. mouthfeel is quite sticky. some brown sugar or some other taste is there too... almost like a watered down barleywine. mouthfeel is really chewey and quite creamy."
"The feel is milky with a pleasant bite on the way down. Somewhat fizzy. It's strong and possibly prohibitive, but hella delicious. Dark and hoppy."
"Incredible beer! My first DIPA and it did not disappoint. First sip was like a Hop-bomb exploding in my mouth. Rich, coppery tones with adequate lacing and foam retention. Taste was simply divine, really hoppy, citrusy, piney and floral aromatics yet somehow well balanced. Despite the hop-load and alcohol content, this went down ultra smooth. Great beer from a great brewery. Keep up the good work!"
"Well worth a try or two ... or three."
"Pours dark amber with a modest off white head and a good amount of lacings. Aroma is malty and a good amount of hops. Taste is very bitter leathery fruity hops with a very large amount of sweet candy like malts. I would have pegged this as a big red ale. Not in the same league as many of the super impy / double IPAs. Decent beer but reminds me some of their Old Chub with more hops. The amount of sweet malts hides the 8.7% abv quite well. Worth a taste and I did enjoy it."
"Pours a dark amber with a dense off white colored head. Great lacing all down the glass. A really nice hop aroma on this one. Fresh citrus and pine hops. This beer is really smooth for a double IPA. The flavor is somewhat strong, but the bitter bite is not. It is nice and mellow yet still hoppy. Citrusy grapefruit, grassy, and pine hop flavors. Great drinkability for this style, no alcohol flavor and the bitterness isn't too overwhelming the mouthfeel is a little oily and thick but that is expected."
"Out of a 12 ounce can and into my nonic pint glass. Appears a hazed golden amber color with about an inch of creamy light rust colored foam. Aroma and flavor are of resinous, piney hops, citrus such as grapefruit, orange, and lemon, floral and grassy with a nice amount of sweet malts and toasted grains. A notch or two more than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Alcohol is well masked, making for a rather drinkable ale."
"I never know what to do in cases where the beer is really good but isn't indicative of a particular style that I can think of. Whatever. This is a good beer and I'd happily drink it again. That's all I know."
"this is rather drinkable, and surprisingly so for a somewhat high abv beer. not super refreshing the way dale's usually feels, but it's a good drink nonetheless."
"D: Good... can is a plus!"
"Overall I think this is an ok IIPA, not to my liking. It is to sweet and syrupy. I love Old Chub and the Dale's Pale Ale, I just found this to be a disappointment. It was canned on 12-08, so maybe fresh it would be more hoppy."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Gritty and firm with a smoothness that lasts through the swallow. This is really a terrific beer, and redefines what kind of quality can be delivered in canned form."
"I'm looking forward to trying this again, but as the first beer of the evening."
"D - Gordon is an interesting beer that's hard to define. While it doesn't scream DIPA (as it is listed on BA), it's pretty hoppy overall. However, I find this to be more on the malty side of the spectrum. Regardless of how you classify Gordon, the result is still a big, tasty brew that one would expect from the makers of Ten Fidy."
"A very good attempt at a dipa in a can. Easy to drink and not too strong. Impressive due to the packaging. Well worth a try but don't bring it to the beach unless you got a spotter or lifeguard."
"Canned on date, 9-13-2008, this Oskar Blues brew might be lacking in the freshness department. Appearance, Smell, Taste, Mouthful are still good but the high abv keeps this from being highly drinkable. I still prefer Bell's Hopslam and Three Floyds Dreadnaught for DIPAs, but this is a nice fall-back brew. Kudos to Oskar Blues for canning its craft beers."
"Creamy texture, with a lightish level of carbonation. Great balance for a DIPA. Solid malt body that quickly succumbs to the hop bomb. Not as bitter as some which makes this a very easy to drink beer. The alcohol is muted, which means this is a deceptively powerful beer."
"D: It's good overall. Could only image what a fresh can must taste like.... More malt than I'd prefer in a Iipa, but it works in this case. Probably won't pick up again due to price and competition."
"D - Great beer overall. Could maybe have attenuated a little further and aged a little longer before kegging."
"Overall it is very smooth and has a nice hoppy finish that fades cleanly leaving you wanting another sip. Great lacing along the glass as I finished this up. I could drink a few of these in one sitting."
"although the high abv, its not too noticeable, great IPA, the balance of the malts and hops really does it for me. you must check it out."
"This is much too easy to drink for an 8.7% brew. Great beer and I am quickly becoming a fan of this brewery."
"Mouthfeel and drinkablity are both okay, its a bit thick, and I wish there was more carbonation to really release that hop scent, but its still a damn good beer, something I will buy again."
"D: Easy to drink, particularly for a DIPA."
"Clear golden amber color with a big fluffy beige head. Lots of sticky lacing and nice retention. Aroma is pineapple juice and a huge dose of caramel and brown sugar. Overly sweet. Flavor is sweet caramel malts and fruity hops. Not a lot of bitterness. Pleasant but not that complex and a little too sweet. Body is medium, carbonation is subdued, high drinkability."
"This beer is dangerously drinkable at 8.70%. And VERY similar to Nugget Nectar IMO, which is a good thing. I typically don't like to compare beers as far as taste goes, but these two beers are very close in taste and smell."
"I'm still kind of unsure as to why they label this like they do, I've never tasted a double ipa like this and there really isn't a lot going on in the way of hops. It's a very good beer, I was just taken aback and was expecting something else. Not the best oskar blues brew but interesting. I'd recommend it to try, anyway. Just kind of sweet and malty with the hops really playing just a minor role in this one."
"Pours dark amber in color with a quarter inch of frothy off white head. Smell is some hops, but there's a lot of malt to help support it. Lots of spotty lacing staying on the side of the glass after each sip. I actually get more malt than hops in the nose. Taste is more of the same. Just a tad bit more malt than hops are there. I have been more than pleased with every other Oskar Blues beer that I have had, but this one is a miss. I won't right it off, I'll try to find another sample and give it another try."
"Drinkability - Fairly solid and drinkable for a pale, I get no hint of the 8.7% either. For a double IPA, its lacking a bit on the hops punch, but almost makes up for it in other areas. Certainly a good beer."
"While I wouldn't put this in my top DIPA list I have to give it credit for being a nicely balanced example. It's definitely good and the balanced character makes it more drinkable than others."
"D: A couple of things stood out to me about this beer. First, this may possibly be the most balanced DIPA that I have ever tried and second, is the way in which the ingredients seem to hide the relatively high abv (8.7%). Don't misunderstand me, it will let you know it's there, but you just can't taste it much. It is obviously a high quality, well made beer. The only issue that I have with it is that I personally prefer my DIPA's to be more openly slanted toward the big hops. Some may consider that a flaw, but I will openly admit to being a fan of good ole American hop bomb Imperial IPA's. That being said, there is no denying the high quality here. I recommend this to anyone who likes good beer."
"D- Bold, yet subtle enough to be enjoyed in great quantity"
"The taste is grapefruity with a lot of grape and raisin, caramelly grain, sweetish with dryish zestiness and very faint bitterness mostly in the end but lingering. Compared to Lagunitas Lucky 13, it's lighter in colour, body, and flavour, thinner,more grapefruit and less caramelly-syrupy. It's highly drinkable but for those looking for a lot of bitterness (I had no idea until after drinking it that this is classed as a double IPA), this is not the beer. I rarely find double IPAs very bitter (and often much less bitter than many IPAs or pale ales), but this is one of the least bitter double IPAs I've had."
"Drinkability: I would have this again. The high abv means its one per sitting. Not a bad beer, but far from my favorite in the style."
""""Nicely balanced""" is not a phrase that's welcome in this house, but this is a rare case where balanced works. There are a lot of mediocre to pretty good DIPAs out there, this one has a bit of a different twist, & points for that. Very good beer."
"Mild on the palate for such a big beer, making it infinitely drinkable if you ignore the 8.7% ABV. Wonderfully delicious and yet another testament to the quality of canned craft beer from Oskar Blues."
"D= Very high. After I take a few more sips and allow it to breath for just a moment it tastes quite nice and the metallic flavor fades but the sweet tea flavor stays around."
"D: I would say so. I consumed this can in mere minutes trying to wrap my head around it. It doesn't sit heavy in the stomach, so that is not a problem. It doesn't have the typical over drying of a regular DIPA, so that doesn't pose a problem. Then again it doesn't have that overly cloying presence of a super malty brew. This beer rides a fine line and really pulls something beautiful off. A big presence in both hops and malt that you can't taste the large alcohol level in and its in a CAN! I almost didn't give it a 5 due to the price (since I like to factor in price to drinkability) but this works for a treat from time to time. This beer works for me, but then again I like malty IPAs and DIPAs. If you don't like malt in your DIPAs, you probably won't be as impressed."
"Maybe my next can will be better, maybe i have a dud, maybe I'm optimistic..."
"This quaffable beer pours a nice dark cherry Amber. Reminds me of my Nugget Nectar in color with a frothy head and lots of delicate lacing. If this beer had garters it would be a hell of a sight. It's perfumed by a strong caramel malt with accents of piney sharpness. The carbonation tickles the tip of your toungue while the bitter hoppiness rolls over the middle. There is a sturdy alchohol finish. The mouthfeel is quite nice and doesn't leave one wanting. And, you've got to love good beer in a can."
"D: very drinkable for an old strong hoppy beer in a can! I say that tongue in cheek. I will be buying more of this."
"Did I get a bad batch? Wow, this is VERY unimpressive."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot and give it kudos for being packed in a can. A bit atypical for a DIPA with its overabundance of malt flavor but I guess that is part of its charm. This will be on my shortlist when drinking in areas that don't allow bottles."
"D: After two of these my tongue felt a bit parched from the bitterness, so I didn't have a third. That being said, it's very easy to drink given that it's 8.7%. The alcohol taste is very subtle if not unnoticable."
"D: A very good DIPA. My second beer from Oskar Blues and I'm very impressed."
"D - At 8.7%, it's really drinkable. However, the sweetness is just a little too much for me, and that would be the sole factor in keeping me back from drinking more than one or two."
"Verdict: Balanced with a big caramel backbone, Gordon has a unique flavor profile for a Double IPA. While it's certainly somewhat less hop-centric and more drinkable than most Double IPAs, don't be fooled into thinking it's weak."
"D: Very friendly beer. I think this beer should appeal to just about anyone who likes a smooth beer that's not too strong."
"Overall, this beer is very good and very drinkable for a DIPA. It has a great mix of malt and hops, almost perfect."
"Pours a reddish colored body, with a bubbly white colored head. Has a nice grapefruity, hoppy aroma, very piney. It very much smells like an IPA. Has a bitter hoppy taste, and a malty aftertaste. A nice sweet taste. Okay, not bad."
"Drinkability: Much better out of the can than on tap, in my opinion, though perhaps that's just my now-converted-to-the-ways-of-the-can mentality. No hint of tinnyness in this one, and I must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'd like to compare it alongside a super-fresh can to see if the taste is a little fiercer fresh - my only """real""" complaint about this one would be the bit of a letdown that results from the nose-to-tongue move."
"D - One thing I liked is that you don't get slammed over the head with a crazy sweetness in an attempt to overcome the aggressive bitterness. Instead, the hops get free reign. Good example of the style, and very enjoyable, if you don't mind a little alcohol presence."
"Overall: Pleasant surprise coming from a can, but then again, it was 11.99 for a 4."
"I go to Ward CO every so often to get spring water and having Oskar Blues only a little out of the way is truly a treat. They have amazing beers and the restaurant is just what a backwoods homebrewing pseudo hippy punk like me is looking for. Thanks for being as strange, fun, cool and having great beer Oskar Blues"
"RJ"
"Amber to red color, nice bone colored head. Good bubbles. A bit of butterscotch in the nose. Some tea-ish hop aromas, grassy green. Not as strong as I would expect in an d-ipa. Same thing with the flavor. Great malt flavor, sweet. Just no hop bomb, which is what I'd expect. Tasty though. Smooth and lush. All together a good drinker. The 8.7 percent would definitely sneak up on yah if you aren't careful."
"Haven't been on that big of a hop kick lately, but I'm thinking that should change. Pours a hazy brass with gold hues into a tulip. The one-finger of head recedes quickly, and some streaks of horizontal and vertical desultory lace are left behind. Smell consists of huge hops mixed in with an undercurrent of grapefruit and orange and some very subtle sweet malts toward the end, which makes for a very aromatically satisfying blend of ingredients. The first sip surprisingly has a good grainy base which is strategically attacked by the hops with perfect timing. Sweet beer bread and spicy candy also exist. This is an excellent Double IPA that definitely has it's own unique character that I predict will draw me back time and again."
"D- This is a pretty drinkable beer for 8.7% abv, and if it tasted like i was hoping it was going to i could drink it all night. as it is, i think the taste brings down the drinkability."
"Very easy drinking DIPA."
"overall, this is a fantastic brew"
"I think the high ratings are largely due to the abv"
"Gordon from Oskar Blues Grill & Brewery pours a nice deep amber that looks great in my pint glass. Short lived but persistent head remains throughout the drink. Smell is mainly of malts and very small amounts of hops. As I drink this beer I'm reminded of Rogue American Amber Ale for some reason. This beer is very smooth going down and the taste is somewhat buttery. Malts are the main player here for me as hops take a backseat. Much lacing is present on the glass. I will recommend this beer even though it seems a little overpriced to me."
"The can pops with little to no carbonation, and the beer looks glorious, a rich, dark red with a small but persistent head. It smells strongly of caramel, very sugary, but with a sharp note of hops. The beer is rich and sweet, nicely balanced, and very warming. I found the mouth feel a little thin, not as think and syrupy, as I would expect, but it's a minor complaint."
"Drinkability - If this wasn't $15 for a four-pack, I would say it's an everyday DIPA. The price is too high for the taste. It's not to say I didn't like it, but the price is off."
"Another brew which is a high ABV but no alcohol taste. Enjoy in moderation. This is a great beer try it out."
"Poured a dark red color with tons of head. Smell was very hoppy, practically oozed out the hops. Taste I thought was a little underwhelming.. kind of a weird mouthfeel to it and very light bodied, especially for the style The high ABV was well hidden for sure, but the beers bark was worse than its bite. The hops weren't there for me in the taste. While its still a good beer.. its not as extraordinary as Old Chub, Ten Fidy, or Dale's... not sure if i'd shell out the $13 for a 4 pack of it."
"D - Extremely drinkable and a true hidden gem in the world of DIPAs... Well balanced and easily hides the 8.7% ABV... I usually can't drink more than one or two DIPAs in a sitting, but this one is different, this is something that I could kick back, relax, and enjoy no matter the occasion..."
"Cheers!"
"This is a pale yellow with almost no head. Smells mildly of citrus. Tastes moderately of citrus, but not intense at all. This would be an OK IPA, but just OK. It has no business calling itself a double IPA, though. Very drinkable and pleasant enough because it's so light, but it's not an impressive DIPA."
"Hard pour into my Duvel Tulip. This has a gorgeous reddish cherry brown mahogany mix, (a little lighter than my kitchen cabinets). A thick > 1""" hazy orange head appears and lasts for quite some time. The brew exhibits mild bubbling. This is an aromatic offering. I detect piny citrus and caramel malt. Unfortunately a little tin from the can as well. Glass swishing produces a deep yeast smell like walking into a bakery. This has absolutely the perfect balance of malt and hops. There are mild syrupy vanilla cream flavors as well as strong pine and hops. Once again the aftertaste is mildly metallic. The mouthfeel is more than medium bodied and smooth. It has a """Wee heavy""" quality to it. Hopheads and Malt heads both can rejoice as this one brings it all together. For a 8.7% brew it is scarily drinkable and this has been my downfall on more than one occasion: This would get an even higher rating from me if they could remove the metal! This must be blissful on tap!"
"Gorgeous IPA. Love the freshness and the incredible hop complexity. So raw, and perfect. This beer is definitely a blessing of phenomonal sorts. One of my favorites."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is easy at first and I'll probably sample a few more of these in the future but it is not going to become a regular."
"D: Nicely balanced and drinkable"
":P"
"D- Hands down one of my new favorites. A beer that I probably couldn't drink all day, because of its alcohol content, but definately could enjoy a 4 pack here and there"
"Future outlook: A nice drink, but not a beer that is readily accessible to me, so I probably won't get to have this again anytime soon."
"Moderately carbonated and I'm not sure if this has to due with the shelf life of this beer or not, but worth mentioning. The 8.7% ABV is well hidden. Certainly one of the best canned beers I've ever had."
"Oskar Blues needs to put Leroy (american brown ale) back into production soon, please."
"D - You wouldn't guess the ABV at 8.7% This could get you in trouble because it is indeed very drinkable."
"D: This beer just begs to be drunk. If it were a bit cheaper, it would be a staple in my fridge at all times of the year. Despite the 8.7%, it hides the alcohol remarkably well. The alcohol is way too high to make this a session beer, but I want to drink this all night."
"This comes in a 4-pack and I could easily drink all 4. I wish it came in a 6-pack, its a very drinkable strong IPA."
"Drinkability was great for the style. Often I can't drink IPAs or DIPAs too quickly or I'll just taste bitterness, but this one is so malty that you could drink this a bit faster. And I certainly would have loved a second one, because it's a great beer."
"D- Considering the strength, pretty easy to drink. Not a session beet, but two of these would be no issue."
"Very good!"
"Notes - If I didn't know better, I would never think it came out of a can. Which blows my notions of beer packaging right out the damn water."
"Overall there's not much I can say that hasn't been said before. There's room for improvement, but even so this is one tasty DIPA. Worth a shot."
"Very velvety mouthfeel, and so drinkable I would never have guessed that this one weighs in at 8.7%. Definately a keeper."
"Amazing stuff here! Opened a real can of whoopass with this one. Highly recommended."
"Poured into my pint glass with very little foam but was a nice looking auburn color. Little lacing due to the lack of head. I got a nice whiff of hops that weren't overwhelming and a bit of malty caramel aroma. The taste for me was excellent with a sweet malt flavor with a balanced hop bite on the back end. The mouthfeel is pleasant with a medium body and not overly carbonated. I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely be revisiting it often."
"I picked up a 4-pack in CT several weeks ago (Oskar Blues doesn't seem to distribute in OH). The best part of the appearance is above-the-beltline, a thick poofy foam that dries in large clumpy lace on the glass. Below the beltline the beer is copper colored and a little hazy. The smell is sort of raw hops, but promises to be a fence-rider between DIPA and barleywine due to the large malt presence. But actually the taste is more DIPA, nicely hopped and well-balanced, some phenols provide nice spicy flavors. The after-taste is much less bitter than it could be, this is a good thing in my book. Medium body, easy drinking. This is a solid beer but not among my favorites for the style."
"This is not you father's can of beer; it is a complex brew that has taken canned beer to an entirely new playing field."
"Ok drinkable, you don't feel like your drinking that much because the can doesn't look that big but it'll catch up to you."
"Overall: a very good example of double IPA from an American brewery. High alcohol content is well masked and does not unduly hinder drinkability."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Overall, an excellent experience, just wish I had more."
"Overall a clean DIPA that lacks some intensity in bitterness and hop flavor. Received in a trade, perhaps the heat impacted it. Still drinkable, I'd likely move on to a different beer after one pint."
"Hazy, deep red-amber color, with a big, bubbly tan head. Big, hearty, malty and dry-hopped nose. Rather reminiscent of Oskar's Dale's Pale Ale - tho much fuller, more roasted, and higher-gravity. At 8.7% abv, that latter observation is no surprise. Dry-hopped nose includes pine and slight citrus peel and alpha-acid tones. Big, full body. Long, intense flavor. Very much like Dale's Pale Ale, w/ lots of intense caramel maltiness, but has more fullness and roasting, w/ slight toffee and tootsite roll flavors. Also less intensely hoppy overall, probably owing to the more intense maltiness and higher gravity. Still has a major, hoppy finish, however. Rather IPA-like tho not sharply bitter as some IPAs are. Long, flavorful, hoppy finish with herbal, hops flower, dry-hopped tones. Some yeasty sediment (unusual in a canned beer). Very flavorful and satisfying, but not overpowering. Another impressive beer from this funky brewery."
"D- easy to finish, i wish i had another can. i could see myself drinking several of these in a night if it was sold in my area. glad i got the chance to try this one."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not good. Needs some work. Nice malt balance."
"I'm sure the debate has gone round and round about the success of any possible cellaring, but I'll probably give it a bit of a go. It's just beer, I'm guessing I'll still enjoy drinking it in a few months time..."
"How the heck do these guys do it? This almost makes me cry that I can't go get an OB beer any time I want. Fantastic DIPA."
"Crazy rich and complex. I could drink quite a few of these but the alcohol content would rock me."
"Fresh out of the can. Pours a hazy auburn with a short bubbly head. Sugary grapefruit and pine aroma. Robust hops in the taste. Lots of grapefruit and resin, with a fair amount of pineapple and mango flavors blended in. Caramel malt backbone with just a little biscuit. A truly righteous imperial red."
"Not my favorite oskar blues but still damn good. Pours a dark golden, amber color with an off white head that leaves good lace. The aroma and flavor are almost identical. Super hoppy with a gigantic malt bill. The beer has a super full body and leaves a lingering bitterness and sweetness"
"Aroma is raw, hoppy - reminds me of homebrew wort. Pours with a decent head that lingers for a bit. Taste is raw, hoppy without much of a malt backbone to balance it. The second one I had was a drainpour, I didn't care for this brew at all. At $11.50 for a 4 pack, this beer is WAY overpriced."
"An all around great brew."
"The mouthfeel is full but a bit too round for me to consider it perfect. This beer has plenty of body. I think this coupled with the 8.7% ABV make me give it a low score on drinkability. I couldn't do more than 2 of these in a sitting without reaching for something a little more tame."
"D: One of the most quaffable DIPAs you will find. Another great one from Oskar, what a wonderful brewery."
"D- Had a slight alchohol burn in the after taste but over all it was good."
"I poured a 12 ounce can into a standard pint glass. Pours an amber/orange with a 2 finger head. The smell is real heavy pine with a pleasant amount of grapefruit mixed in. The taste is of a dry gin&tonic(a good thing). The pine taste is heavy with a sticky piney aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied and the 9% abv is not noticeable."
"Pours a clear coppery red color with 2+ fingers of foamy eggshell colored head. Great retention leaves nice sticky lacing. Smells of caramel and biscuit, pine, floral hops, and citrus. Tastes of apricot, orange peel, and grapefruit up front then brown sugar, caramel, and bread in the backbone. Finishes with some dry grass, pine resin, and a touch of alcohol. Medium in body with good carbonation. Hoppy yet balanced, sticky with some spiciness and lightly lingering bitterness in the finish. A great double IPA, very sessionable, and being canned makes it a great beer for outside consumption."
"Had the pleasure of visiting Capone's for the first time on this day. Matt had a good bit of stuff on tap, which was quite welcomed. Poured a nice golden amber color. not much head. very hoppy in the nose. I guess this brew only uses amarillo hops. so it has quite the piny smell. The taste is very similar, great for a hophead (like myself). Very crisp and piney in the taste as well. up front taste in the mouth. nice beer overall."
"D= This is an excellently balanced DIPA. Has all of the hops it should, yet remained balanced and produced enough sweetness to really do all those hops justice. Excellent!"
"Highly decent, and strange that it is in a can. Memorable, if not fantastic."
"D- This is a really drinkable beer. Although I taste a tad bit of the alcohol, the overall hoppiness and tad bit of malts suits my preferences very well. Thanks aubuc1 for a great experience in my first trade!"
"Drinkability is great very good I2PA malty and hoppy , very aromatic and tasty all from a can."
"D- This is a really well-rounded beer. Although not a session beer, a couple cans can certainly be enjoyed."
"Orange/amber pour, nice off white head arose. Citrus, pine aromas, faint sweet malt. Interesting for a pale, almost creamy mouthfeel. Nice bitter hop up front, but quickly mellows to some sweet malt and light red and citrus fruits. Little biscuity. Very clean, alcohol well hidden. I particularly liked it because it was not just a hop bomb. Pretty excellent version of the style."
"Dark brown pour with a frothy white top that never fully went away. Complex aroma with dark malts and floral smells. Creamy, caramel flavor with a rougher, earthy texture. Maybe some toasted malts but it's not much. Some florals. Very well balanced with lots of complexity. At some points I also noticed some pine, citrus and an oily bitterness."
"Overall: Thanks go out to both Russpowell and mentor for gererously hooking me up with this beer. This beer is great, and I am glad that I have another can. This is a good beer to be drinking as Barak Obama just got named as the winner of the presedential election. Cheers"
"Feel is nice, a medium-full body, good carbonation make it so the hop doesn't kill the palate. I could have another but the alcohol makes it end there."
"I had high expectations for this canned brew, and they were not met. This beer is just too boring. When I think of DIPAs I expect to be blown away with either malt or hops. This takes the safe route and goes light on...everything. The one perk of this beer is the hidden abv. It's already sneaking up on me. A sub-par DIPA at best."
"Staring at the can, you really want to start drinking right from it, but I resisted the temptation. Pours out very, very hazy, with a sticky decent-sized head. Leaves a fair bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is pretty good. You can smell citrusy and piny hops in the beer, which just beg you to drink. The taste is great in terms of hops, and there's a strange sweetness that I can't quite figure out, something like honey perhaps. It goes down fairly easy, and I enjoyed drinking it. Most likely I'll have another someday, if I see it on a shelf and I'm wondering what to buy."
"D: pretty nice, but a little heavy all around, i could probably drink a few but not too many, the alcohol presence is a good reminder to not over do this one."
"Drinkability - High. You'd never guess this beer is 8.7% ABV. I only wish it weren't limited availability."
"Drinkability: Really smooth with great complexity and balance. Overall flavor is more on the subtle side which gives this a pretty high drinkability. Still, this didn't taste like an imperial IPA; it tasted like a dubbel. I don't know if all Gordons are like this (I only got one can), or if this can had issues."
"Of 3 Oskar Blues purchases (Dale's and Old Chub) this was the one that knocked the socks off. Yes, a DIPA, but balanced and ungodly smooth. Pours a reddish amber with a short lived head. Aromas of grapefruit more than resiny pine. Taste follows suite, but not the hop bomb I was anticipating. The bitterness is there, but it is very nicely balanced by a smooth sweetness. But the real kicker for me - and this was true for the Dale's and the Old Chub as well - was the mouthfeel and drinkability. Their beers are so smooth and creamy. Dangerously drinkable? You betcha. I have got to get my hands on some Ten Fidy...The mind boggles..."
"This poured a dark, slightly hazy mahogany with tan head. It smelled like roasted red barley and earthy wheat, along with some sweet caramel malt and floral and pine hops. It tasted like earthy roasted barley malt with sweet caramel and bitter, rusty copper cops and a bit of licorice. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a robust bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a lot of depth of flavor, more like an imperial red than 2IPA. But it was fairly tasty, very clean and easy to drink despite the higher alcohol level. It had great body (as with all Oskar beers), and was overall pretty enjoyable."
"This is my kind of IPA. Plenty of malt and caramel to balance the prodigious quantity of hops. Amber and caramel in appearance, with substantial head. Smell is good, nothing that out of the ordinary. Mouthfeel is thick, sweet, and nicely carbonated. Overall, one of the more enjoyable IPAs I've had."
"12oz can from a liquor store in northern Mass. Pours a hazy copper-red with a good half inch of light tan head that leaves a fair bit of nice lacing. Citrussy piney hops dominate the aroma, but not without a fair bit of caramel malt to add balance. Tastes like piney, citrussy, and grassy hops with just enough caramel toffee malt to give the beer some balance. Silky smooth mouthfeel, like few beers I've had, with ample carbonation helps make this sipper go down fast. Wow, what an awesome beer. Surely one of the best examples of the style. Practically perfect in every way."
"D- average, usually drink a DIPA down pretty quick, but i think because of the sweetness it took a little longer to drink than usual. Cool seeing a DIPA out of a can, just wish it was a little cheaper"
"Drinkability- This is the highlight of the beer for me. I could drink a dangerous amount of these. The alcohol doesn't hinder the drinkability at all. They go down smooth, and I immediately want to go to the fridge and grab another...but I only had one. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed that Oskar Blues come back to OR. Thanks again Paul (Lum), yet another awesome extra."
"This IPA is not your typical IPA..Hoppy nose, grapefruity mouthfeel, but a caramel/malt flavour to kick out the hops at the end of the drink. A most drinkable IPA, and if mor IPA's tasted like this, I would turn into a notable hophead! I highly recommend this brew to any anti-hophead, see the difference and appreciate!"
"Medium-bodied and packing a hop punch, this beer still retains a little sweetness and is very pleasing at it passes the tongue and goes down smooth. Pleasant aftertaste; the fact that this stuff is in a can and cheap is amazing - I couldn't session b/c of the high ABV (I must note that they hid it well). This is a graet DIPA."
"Pours a very cloudy, orangey, gold with a thick, soft white head. The aroma is very hoppy but also intensely fruity. Citrus and hops combined with a fruity malt profile. The flavor follows the aroma - lots of soft fruit, strong malts, balanced well by a ton of floral and fruity hops. The balance is impeccable. The finish is both very bitter from hops but also very fruity and sweet with malts. The after-taste is very hoppy - but not bitter. The mouthfeel is very full bodied, but nice on the tongue - not syrupy. Overall - amazing!"
"This beer poured a cloudy copper color with single finger head that dissipated after a while. The smell is a big surge of citrus and piney hops with some maltiness. The taste starts off with some citrusy hops that give way to some caramel maltiness that is cut by some piney and floral hops. The mouthfeel is thick with fine carbonation and a little bit of warmth from the alcohol. I'd consider this beer very drinkable considering how much hoppiness there is."
"I have nothing to say bad about this brew. Absolutely nothing. Give me more."
"Mouthfeel is clean and sharp, but a tad too heavy for the style, good nonetheless."
"Overall, a very good DIPA. It's not as bitter as other beers of the style, which I like. Makes this one much more drinkable to me. Each sip leaves me wanting to take another."
"Nice amber glow with a pleasant head. I don't know Gordon Knight, but I do know Gordon McCrary and he'd be happy with this beer too. Not overly hoppish and almost tasting more of a regular IPA compared to an imperial because it is so smooth, almost creamy. Doesn't have the hops bite I was thinking but I always feel like the hops gets toned down once it hits high alcohol. One of the best drinks I've had in a while. I've been very happy with Oskar."
"D: Rather drinkable. I like this one more and more everytime I taste it."
"A very interesting twist on the DIPA style. The beer poured a nice dark amber color with great head and lace on the glass. The smell threw me off at first with much malt sweetness and slight hops in the background. The flavor pretty much followed suit with a large dose of caramel sweetness up front, then a slight shot of hops in the middle followed by a sweet aftertaste that left you wanting more. I can't say this is one of my top DIPA's but it is quite a unique beer and one to bridge the gap for malt lovers into the IPA world."
"This is my kind of IPA, and comes in a can!"
"Drinkability: Incredible looks and smell, but the hop flavor was lower than expected for a beer called a DIPA. While smooth, malty, and nice to drink, I am not sure it is tops with respect to the style."
"Tthis is an awesome imperial IPA. It's got everything, the look taste and drinkability and the 8.7% gives it balls."
"I could easily drink 3-4 of these in a session, it's very drinkable. Oskar Blues makes some damn tasty brew, and I'm glad to finally have been able to get my hands on some Gordon."
"This can was a dud for what I was expecting. A muted Double IPA is not very exciting to drink. Next..."
"D - excellent beer. Will definitly buy again. Due to the style I don't think many of these in a row is called for."
"Gordon's DIPA is really none of the above, to its credit, and what a relief. The beer is full bodied, no doubt, and you will get a goodly dose of a high ABV, but overall the beer is creamy, thick, mellow, and toned down compared to most others of the style. The beer pours a clear dark amber color with a nice creamy head, retention, and lacing. The aroma is very typically DIPA, lots of estery hop notes, oily hop residuals, lots of sweet malts, caramels, and some very bready smells as well. The aroma is first rate, and not too over the top. The taste is just a creamy delight. It is a thick, syrupy, full bodied beer, but it just stays well inside of the line of being forced to do more than it should. This one is a real winner, well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drink ability - This is a very solid imperial ipa. It makes my top 10 ipa list. I will enjoy this one again."
"Please distribute this in KY. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability -- Very good for style, but I feel a buzz rather quickly. I wouldn't want more than one in a night, but it's definitely a beer I'd like to have on hand."
"D - Pretty drinkable for a DIPA. I could have a couple."
"I could have a few of these and what a great option for the beach or races versus the other canned options??? Good beer can be put in a can!!!"
"drinkability: good"
"Overall a grand experience I'm glad I participated in. Its definitely original and ballsy, but not quite my bag (heh heh heh). I'd throw a few in a cooler though, just to surprise some unsuspecting beer lurkers. I respect it, but just don't appreciate it all that much."
"Mouthfeel is heavy with big carbonation."
"Very mild carbonation and a super smooth mouthfeel make it very easy to drink. Wish they'd distribute in Ohio."
"Pours a transparent amber/orange, with a small off-white head. Smells of raw citrus hops. Very pungent. Taste is surprisingly malty, with a toasty flavor up front, followed by herbal, piney hops. Not very much citrus in the taste, but I looked at the website and it says it is dry hopped with amarillo, so that probably explains the different hop flavor. Very good, although there is a touch of alcohol heat in the finish. Drinkability is good, a great beer for sipping on."
"good stuff yo"
"Overall, an incredible beer from a world-class brewery. I'm so glad that we finally get some OB's in Texas finally. Highly recommend. Get off your butt and go find one. Regular rotation for sure."
"D: A tad sweet to be quaffable (at least in the DIPA realm), but it's still damn good. Oskar Blues just doesn't make bad beer. Period. I think Gordon is more of a double/imperial amber/red ale than a true DIPA, and it's really tasty."
"Drinkability: I got a 4-pack of this for $10, which I thought was a pretty good deal, especially since I'm such a fan of all the other Oskar Blues brews. This goes down very very easy, so was very easy to look down and see only a few sips left after what seemed like only a few minutes. I don't think it's breaking any new ground, but the alcohol is extremely well-hidden and almost non-existent, though you can feel it later. Balanced and of very high quality, and I'm certainly glad I have a few more left."
"Drinkability - a very drinkable DIPA. Not top shelf but I like in a dangerous sort of way. Thanks to mully for bringing me this at DLD08."
"4/4/4.5/3.5/4.5"
"This is one of those beers that just doesn't fit a style it is in between a Barleywine and a DIPA. Nice beer, but if you want a DIPA that will render your tongue useless after you drink it, get something else. If you are looking for a big balanced beer, this is it. Recommended."
"D- Great beer. High ABV makes this a brew that I wont session much, but I can see myself enjoying this brew quite a bit!"
"This beer is very drinkable, especially if it's hot out."
"Oskar Blues Gordon pours a bright orange red with a nice tan head. The aroma is loads of C hops, tons of citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine. The sweet caramel maltiness comes through, but barely behind the hops. The flavor is a punch of bitterness first leading to resiny fresh hoppy flavor. More lightly piney citrus as well as a bit of metallic, almost grassy hops. The malt is there and although it doesn't shine, it does a great job of balancing the hops. Gotta love craft beer in a can, I wish I could get it locally!"
"This beer pours a very dark amber with a creamy 1 finger head. The smell is of citrus and pine. The flavor is very smooth a nice inital strong hop flavor followed by a wonderful malty finish. The main flavors are grapefruit and pine with a very sooth malt finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth and comfortable. A very drinkable beer, almost a 4.5, but the dry aftertaste would force me to drink something else after a few beers. Well done brew!"
"Four 12oz cans purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston for $12. It's not too often I get to enjoy Oskar Blues beers after having an Old Chubb explode in my checked suitcase on a flight. But I was spending a full week in Boston this time, so I took the opportunity to drink some cans while in town. I had to choose between the Gordon or the Ten Fidy, and was in a hop mood. Pours a clear dark red with a big fluffy head and a hoppy aroma I can smell from over a foot away. A plethora of lacing. The flavour is well balanced with a solid malt base and hops that linger long after the beer is swallowed. Taste is perhaps slightly lighter than expected for the alcohol level, but it's still a nice bold brew. I was planning to say that the beer perhaps didn't warrant its $3/can pricetag, but this last one is making me rethink that."
"D - This one is very deceptive. It's smooth, refreshing, and enjoyable, and the 8.7% abv is barely noticable."
"Pours almost like a red ale. Darker color brew with a fine beige head. Has a bread like smell and something sharp, like a can? Not a big smell. Nice sweet malt taste up front with some hop coming through in the finish. Nice lacing. This is pretty easy to drink. This is a lot more flavorful after warming. The can smell is gone and replaced with a caramel, malt aroma. I can taste the alcohol in the finish. Another great beer from a can."
"Drinkable for a DIPA, but the ABV sneaks up on you. Not a real sessionable beer. It's longer on malt perhaps than most brews of the style. Tastes like kind of a cross between an amber and an IPA. I wouldn't mind trying the canned version one day."
"Pours a hazy orange marmalade colour with half a finger of off white head and nice lacing. Nose- caramel, and pine. Taste- a chewy caramel pineapple candy. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy. Caramel and sweet cookie dough are front and center. Hops certainley don't overpower- pine needle, earthy hops meld very well with the malt. Finishes dry and puckering from the hops with still some lingering sweetness but not too cloying. Nice stuff"
"The mellow character of this one makes it very easy to drink, but I'd still probably stop at one just because of the abv."
"A sure-fire winner from Oskar Blues. It's very different than your typical DIPA. I think Oskar Blues actually describes it as a DIPA- Imperial Red hybrid of sorts, which definitely makes sense. Whatever it is, it's a very good beer and one to be sought out. Recommended."
"Pours a copper/ amber-ish color, with a off white to light tan head. In the aroma, big piney hops, and a grapefruity sweetness. In the taste, piney hops, and a nice malt backing. A small hop bite, and medium bodied mouthfeel, and a semi dry piney hop in the aftertaste. Nice big hops, with a good malt backing. Nice, very nice."
"Drinkability: I got a single and am regretting not going for the 4 pack... this is a very enjoyable example of the style... the alcohol is well hidden and there's something for everyone is this beer."
"D. Pretty drinkable despite the high abv. At $6.50 a can, one was enough. I will say this is the best beer I've ever had from a can."
"Overall Impression: A very interesting beer. A beast with a refined manner, a little Jekyll and Hyde action going. The leathery/earthy element is different, and I could see having this again, but I don't think I'll be buying it by the 6 like I do with Dale's Pale. Worth a try for sure."
"I really enjoyed this beer, just wish it was easier to get in New England..."
"Got this on tap at the Big Hunt, a nice treat after missing out on the Hop Red from Green Flash. This one was quite good. Looked how an IPA should (or DIPA), although the head and lacing didn't quite stand up to what I expected of a top-of-the-line DIPA. Flavor and nose are high on strong, piney hops...this one isn't that much stronger than a high ABV IPA (I had a Two Hearted right after and didn't really notice any difference in hoppiness), but it's still quite good, especially if you're looking for piney hops with just a touch of grapefruitiness in there too. Body was solid, although didn't sit on the tongue as long as the Two Hearted. Overall, quite tasty, on tap just as in the can."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Alcohol is moderate and flavors are decent making for a fairly easily consumed brew."
"Enjoy this one!"
"All in all a very nice beer."
"This probably will not replace my favorite SoCal Imperial IPAs, but certainly the best IPA in a can. Very good stuff!"
"Tastes belgian at first then hop puts it in a different place. Middle has some burnt flavors, like a campfire marshmellow. Gives me a bit of heat at the end. Definately hides the high alcohol content, I can see why more than 8 of these could be troubble. I'd like to see a version of this as a session beer."
"D- This is a very nice beer that has good balance and a nice sweet support to the flavorful hops. The hop bitterness balances with the hops flavor and sweetness alike."
"Notes: By far the best canned beer i've ever had, would get a case if i could find it in pa"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with an off-white head that sticks around nicely and leaves impressive lacing. Smells of floral hops and fresh oranges with a full malty sweetness. Taste follows suit. Incredible well balanced for such a huge beer. Hops are powerful and oily but not hugely bitter, but finish with lemon rind that sticks. Malt is here in spades, adding honey and a touch of biscuit. Again surprisingly sweet. Resiny and medium full body. Carbonation tickles the mouth nicely. Too drinkable for 8.7%. I could get in trouble with this."
"Bottle courtesy of gford217: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter and citrus hops are dominating. Taste is also dominated by those citrusy and bitter Qwest Coast hops with a nice caramel malt profile that is overshadowed by the hops. Full body with some good carbonation and no discernable alcohol behind all those hops. One-dimensional for sure but still very tasty and nonetheless a beer I wouldn't mind having access on a regular basis."
"Pours a hazy copper with a single finger head that dissipates to a thin layer of foam that just sits on top leaving a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Smells like pine trees after a rainy day with notes of citrus and caramel-like sweetness. This stuff tastes pretty, much like awesome. The hops are a bit subdued, playing second fiddle to the malt. There are flavors of caramel, pine, and mild notes of citrus that leaves a nice warm creamy, sticky feeling in the mouth. The big malty, stickiness and awesome flavor make this a sure winner for me. I Wish Oskar Blues was distributed here in Michigan..."
"[can 'o bliss. satisfy ya.]"
"D: Only a few, but don't get me wrong, this brew is awesome!"
"D- Very drinkable and easy to consume."
"D - This is a highly drinkable DIPA. Full delicious flavor that hides the alcohol quite well. I think this is one of the better double IPAs I've had. Highly recommended!!!"
"Great beer, well worth tasting. I'm still amazed it came from a can. Looking forward to trying some of their other offerings."
"D - If I could afford it, get me a 12 pack of this stuff on a Friday night. LOL."
"D - Pretty drinkable put not to much with the 8.7% ABV. Best out of the can IMO."
"The fact this beer comes in cans get high grades from me. A very good DIPA and extremely fresh tasting."
"Drinkability: it was a hoppy beer, but not an overly hopped Double IPA. Well, I guess it was more piney and grapefruity than anything else. I didn't have any problems with this beer. In fact, I guess the only problem I had with it was that it didn't last long in my glass. Not a once in a while treat. This could easily be used as a session Double IPA if it wasn't so expensive. Yet another canned winner from Oskar Blues."
"D: For the style, this one is very drinkable. It is quite hoppy, but not so overbearing that you couldn't drink a few easily. Just be careful with the ABV."
"Drinkability- Goes down a bit too smoothly (considering the ABV). A bit too sweet to be thirst-quenching, but that's to be expected. I love this stuff. I think I'll have another..."
"M&D: Medium to full body beer. Just right on the carbonation. You don't notice the alcohol at all, which makes this is a highly drinkable brew. I don't think this is a DIPA. I think this is much more along the lines of an American Barleywine. Thick, creamy, and smooth. The hops are not the star like they should be in a DIPA. But, that being said, a very nice selection from Oskar Blues. Skal."
"Overall I like it, but it's not what I am used to for the style. Not as bold and rich as I expect. More delicate, and in some ways, more interesting because of it."
"Frighteningly easy-drinking for the ABV. Very soft, creamy mouthfeel, but not sticky, and decent carbonation. For those who doubt decent beers come from cans, this would be a good beer to challenge that notion."
"HV"
"This is a really well done IIPA and up there with my current favorites in the category."
"D - A home run, but at 8.7% ABV there's only such much one can inflict upon the liver."
"a wonderful awesome sexy beer .. very very nice head, lacing o' plenty .. lots of hop and piney and sweet flavours... this beer just flows down the gullet .. smooth as silk .. no more locked doors, gracias ... this one good ruby red radical brew!! oh ya!!"
"Cheers to Gordon Knight & Oskar brewing!"
"I had this, from a can, at Sugar Maple in Bayview, WI."
"Alot of flavors going on here. Take your time and enjoy this beer. I usually drink one and move on."
"Poured a dark amber/burnt orange color developing a 1/2 inch head and generous lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and grass. Taste is of roasted malts and caramel backed up with huge dose of American hops giving this one good balance and a dry bitter finish. Thick and creamy, average carbonation and an overall pleasure to drink."
"Nice chewy/sticky mouthfeel."
"I did not care for this one at all."
"D - I've only got one of these tonight, otherwise I'd pour at least one more. This is an extremely smooth and mellow DIPA that hides its ABV quite stealthily. A joy to drink."
"A poor example of the style in my opinion."
"The smell of this beer is its high point. So much going on in hops and malt."
"I enjoyed this beer straight from the can so I can't really comment on the appearance and smell of it, but I still quite enjoyed it. It's got a nice amount of maltiness before the bitter hops start to come into play. It rounds out with a woody taste that made me want to keep going back to try more. A strong flavor and like nothing I've ever had before."
"D: A very good Double IPA. At times I wasn't as in to it as I thought I would be, but overall another tasty brew from the new to CA Oskar Blues. When I see this beer in cans I will definitely pick up some."
"D - A very well rounded DIPA that doesn't quite stand out in any category but comes together to excel overall. Great flavor, certainly worth seeking out. As you might expect, alcohol packs a bit of a punch at 8.7% ABV."
"This stuff was poured out of can into a pint glass... two hours ago. It was amber in color with a decently lasting head. Basically take an IPA and make it an amber, or take an amber and make it an imperial. The mouthfeel was thicker from both the citrusy/piney oily hops and smooth chewiness of the malts. It was caramelly, sweet and had a decent hop profile. This stuff was actually fairly balanced and smooth although slightly more bitter (in comparison to a standard amber). Medium mouthfeel should be expected. Made me believe a can can hold a decent beer."
"D - A drinkable beer, but leaves a lingering sweetness on the lips. Could be cloying if this came in a 6-pack."
"I love drinking this bitch out a can too! What a fucking awesome beer."
"date code 6 09 13a 1 ba, pours a cloudy copper color with a thin white head which vanished immediately leaving little lacing in my nonic ; a moderate smell laden w/ citrusy hop and cereal grains, some caramel and dark fruit notes but very subtle ; a rather sweet malt accented flavor w/ well balanced hop bitterness, a bready/caramely taste up front quickly turns to nuts and piney hop giving it a strong tea-like undertone, finishes crisp w/ a hint of mineral ; a med. body with a good amount of co2 leaves a creamy feeling on the tongue ; a good beer indeed, prob. better fresher, def. doesn't drink like an 8.7 ABV brew at all..."
"This is in the Maharaja-camp of DIPA's, not the Ruination-camp. I prefer the latter."
"can in to a goblet. Hazy dark orange pour with minimal head. Smells grapefruity and piney, yet smoothe. More malty than I expected to taste. Strong hop presence, but biscuity malt flavor. I guess I shouldn't underestimate Oskar Blues, this was much more than I anticipated. Very good beer, and slightly different than other DIPA's I have had."
"I have said before that it seems as if the Imperial IPA style has become a bit overdone. It is a great style, which is a testament to its success and popularity, but somewhere in the process, I feel that some creativity was lost. Lets see how this one fairs. Pours a dark orange, with a large, fluffy, white head. Looks pretty dark for a DIPA, which might be from the addition of chocolate malt. Aroma is big on resinous hops...sticky and pungeant ones that give scents of grapefruit, pine, and tree sap. Taste comes in waves, with a quick blast of hops to begin with, juicy fruit in the middle, tobacco and earth notes to finish things up. Not really a hop bomb in the sense that it doesn't destroy the taste buds completely. I think this is a good thing, in that although the hops shine well enough to beat the malt, everything is perfectly balanced. A nice chewy DIPA, yet still remains very drinkable. The alcohol leaves a great warmth after the first can. This is an exception to the trend of samey Imperial India Pale Ales. Not only reliably fresh, but also one of the best out there IMO. One to seek out, sip and enjoy with friends. Cheers"
"Taste came through, was anticipating something uniquely hopped and was disappointed. Reminded me a lot of their Dale's Pale Ale, but nowhere near as flavorful or well designed. May have to try a can locally or get a fresher pour and re-evaluate, update this after another try. Still a good beer from a talented brewer, but nothing like the exceptional Dale's Pale Ale they make (which is much more like an IPA than a pale ale)."
"overall it's just highly drinkable, I think that this double IPA is in the same league as 90 minute or hopslam. Great beer."
"I was super impressed with this DIPA and my very first canned craft brew. It's full from front to back, and the alcohol is hidden nicely, resulting in a high level of drinkability. It's so tasty and in line with what I like in a high-hopped ale."
"D: One of the best DIPAs out there and one of the few I could drink all night. Unfortunately, I bet I'd be paying for that in the morning."
"D- pretty good beer"
"Acquired in a trade with thickerfreakness. Thanks dude! Decanted from the can into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a one finger head that fizzles away quickly. Aroma of citrus, resin, and sweet caramel malts. The taste starts with some resiny bitterness, which transitions into a a citrus flavor, with some caramel underneath. Mouthfeel is right in the middle. IPAs and DIPAs are always easy to drink for me and this one isn't any different. Overall this beer is great and exactly what I wanted this afternoon."
"What more could you want out of life?"
"D - Awesome brew! Best IPA avaliable in a can in my area until surly loosens it's belt :)"
"By far one of the best IIPA out there and the fact that this is out of a can is what makes this a supprise. I will be sure to keep this on a short list of feel good beers."
"Enjoyable for a Double but would have enjoyed the hops sticking with you a little longer in the aftertaste"
"M/D - Syrupy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Too sweet for me though. A good DIPA, just too much malt sweetness. I prefer mine to be a big mouthful of hoppiness."
"D : Real easy to drink"
"Wow, excuse me while I just lean back and savor this wonderful beer... and out of a can too. Forever more, this will always be my pool-/beach-side beer. And a frequent late night companion as well."
"D: Overall this a very nice DIPA. Other than the nose, I found nothing exceptional in the beer, but it's very easy to drink and quite accessible for those not familiar with large, heavy-hitting hop bombs. Packaging in a can (a novelty for craft beers) makes this easy to grab and take with you to a variety of places. Probably couldn't have more than 3 or 4 of these in a sitting without becoming addled and tongue-fatigued, but I enjoyed it very much and would keep it around often if it was available locally."
"Notes: Rating this I couldn't help but think it's a """good""" beer, hence all the fours. It's not 100% excellent, but it's definitely one I wouldn't pass up. A great brew for those that can get it."
"It's hard to believe this came from a can. The odor is pine, resin, hops, hops. It tastes like just hops. Grapefruity hops. There's some malty sweetness back there, definitely, but I have to squint to find it, because the hop bitterness is very strong for me."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for sending this rare treat my way!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Oskar Blues does IPA's very nicely."
"Mild enough to consider sessionable in winter but a little too much wallop (that's not a bad thing). Good stuff!"
"This beer hides the 8.7abv well, would be good to drink on the top of a mountain, and good for day hike so you can just bring one light can with you. This empty can smells chronic."
"D: Easy drinking DIPA. The pine is not too much as its balanced well. The only set back is the slight alcohol warming which could deter one from """pounding back""" good Ol' Gordon."
"I like Gordon. A very Hair Of The Dog kinda name, and even though I never knew Gordon Knight, I'm guessing his taste in beer was impeccable. Glad I have a couple of these left, it's a treat. More brewers need to can--a beer like this proves canned beer can be awesome."
"D- At $15-16 a 4-pack, its unlikely that I'll buy this again (unless I were to find it on tap somehere) It is very drinkable, but there are a lot of really good <$4/can beers out there too."
"Overall, an interesting brew that people should at least check out. But at around $15 a 4-pack, I'll probably only pick up one or so a year. Would love to try it on tap (or cask)."
"Pours a unique, very nice looking deep red color, some orange highlights with a nice white fluffy head. Smell is quite good, smells like a midnight sun DIPA. A sweet smell also. Taste is quite good. Beautiful malt presence and a nice sweetness. Hop flavor is well rounded and bold with a nice citrus/pine hop flavor, with a little bit of spice. Nice thick body and mouthfeel, slightly more viscous than your average DIPA, which I like. Drinkability is quite good, very slammable. Dangerously so. Certainly a wonderful offering from OB. I really wish they would start distributing up here. A very smooth, tasty, mobile brew!"
"Taste wise, this beer does the American IPA quite well. It has that sticky mouthfeel that is a monster in hoppiness. It ranks right up there with brutal bitters, my other favorite double IPA."
"D: I was kind of surprised to see the ABV on the can. It hides it very well, but that could be all it takes to do someone if not expecting it! Sip away, enjoy the flavour... there's something of a macro quality to the can, perhaps, that makes it so much nicer to not have to guzzle a drink to feel the pleasant benefits!"
"Big thanks to CBurian (Team SINISTER will win!!! BIF Race '08) for my first canned craft beer. SWEET! Very cool can. Pours ruby / mahogony with a sticky offwhite head that paints the sides of the glass with lace. Smell is hops. Pine resin, mouthpuckering, sticking whole hops up your nostrils hop smell with a very small buscuitty malt finish. Taste is bitter, piney hops, carmel hints and a floral hop finish. Alcohol is hidden to a scary point. I could drink these all night... relatively speaking."
"Great beer, I would seek this out again if it ever finally becomes available locally."
"Drinkability: A nice DIPA, that is well-balanced and flavorful"
"D = This is a very approachable beer, with the mixture of sweet tastes which reminded of a sweet roll breakfast pastry and the nice strong marmalade quality of citrus zest (though offest perhaps by the pine notes), this would be an awesome breakfast beer, but at 8.7% ABV, you'd better not have much to do that day."
"D: Another winner from Oskar Blues. Very tasty and dangerously drinkable for the high ABV. I will revisit this brew again. Recommended!"
"Thanks to the HIP HOP BIF for this one!"
"This is a very drinkable brew. The only downside is that it is canned and not bottled."
"This is one of my favorite Hop-Head fixes and just tastes so fresh coming out of the can. A great mix of juicy hops, bready malts, and a big drinkability that belies it's almost 9% ABV. This is a complete winner for me."
"Another canned accomplishment from Oskar Blues. Balanced, yet bold with few errors in flavor."
"The look of this beer was almost unearthly. It was practically glowing, and the color looked different every time I took a sip. The flavor had a chameleon-esque quality as well. Flavors emerged & subsided consistantly, except for the bitterness which stood strong from the first sip to the last and beyond."
"Pours a nice thick head that has great retention and lacing. The color is golden brown caramel color. The hops are green smelling hops with a sweet malty caramelized smell too. The hops smell like grapefruit citrus hops. The flavor is very hoppy with a sticky feeling sweet caramel malt backbone. Aftertaste is fresh green hops, reminds me of brew day's late hop additions. Mouthfeel is great, I poured hard into a Surly pint glass and left to warm for 30 minutes. Feels like light carbonation with a medium full body. Overall, this is very good and I would have 3 or 4 of these with BBQ."
"Overall I'm very happy I had a chance to try this beer. I recieved 2 more to try at a later date and I'll update this review if anything changes. I love good beer from a can, and this one fits that bill nicely."
"Another quality brew from OB - and from a can, classic!"
"Pretty damn drinkable for its 8.7% ABV, only reveals itself with the slightest amount of alcohol warmth, just the way i like it. A great stepping stone to bigger, hoppier brews, and a tasty one with enough depth to be well worth coming back to from time to time. Obviously a bit too boozy for session fare, but it would be nice to knock pack a four pack or more on occasion. I have yet to be disappointed by Oskar Blues, and look forward to drinking this one again, as well as finally getting my paws on some Ten Fidy!"
"Pours a rich amber color with a smallish head. Smell is caramel, sweet oranges, and bitter pine. Taste is sweet and orangey caramel along with the same piney hops present in the nose. Slightly thick and a bit syrupy going down but not cloying in flavor. Very drinkable, in fact, with a sharp, short lived piney hop flavor balanced well by the sweet orange and caramelly malt. The carbonation is on the soft side making it rich and smooth. This stuff is great!"
"The hops are there but there is nothing to balance this beer. It just tastes like a watered down hop-juice IPA. This is a far departure from Oskar Blues' Dale's Pale Ale, which is great. This beer just doesn't measure up, to Dale's or any DIPA I have had."
"D: The stated IBU and ABV seem like a lie. Would be one of the most drinkable DIPAs yet, but it's just too sweet for me to have very much of it."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I doubt I will ever get another bottle of this, but a HUGE thank you to Tayner for sending me this amazing brew."
"Drinkability is near perfect for me. I just wish this was available at my local stores in NH."
"Overall an interesting beer that delivers a unique balance that I wouldnt expect form a DIPA"
"D- Oskar Blues does great things. I have yet to try one of their beers that I have been less than enamored of, I need to make a pilgrimage..."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a creme head that falls to nothing and leaves quite a bit of lace. Nose is a thick floral citrus hoppy thing with a strong portion of piney resin. Flavor is a bitter earthy hoppy tone. It's nice and full and firm, but not overly complex I think. Smooth feel with a slightly lower but biting carbonation. This is a nice DIPA. Nothing real crazy going on, but it's a good one to drink and you can definitely go for more than one. You've gotta love Oskar Blues!"
"This is a pleaseant beer to be sure, but again, its a bit odd for the style."
"Body a bit thin, but has good carbonation. A very tasty beer. However, I had one of these that was a few years old and it did not age well."
"This was a good beer experience. If you run across a can, give it a go. My favorite can beer thus far."
"(original date of review: 9/16/2007)"
"D: Drinkability was very good with a big flavor hopping of citrus that was wet, thirst inducing, and made you look forward to the next sip."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Earthy, citrusy hops with a big toffee and biscuit malt flavor. Medium-bodied, crisp and easy to drink despite the high ABV. I prefer my IPAs with a bit less malt, but this is a great brew nonetheless."
"The feel is thin and delicate for so much hops, but this adds to the drinkability. It's a bit sticky, but it could stand to be fuller-bodied. I'm not sure if the price tag ($4-4.50/can) is warranted but this one will definitely give you your hop fix, and some unique flavors at that."
"What an amazing beer. Could live off this, nectar and two hearted. Imperial red is a great description of this one."
"This would be my goto DIPA in the off Hopslam and Double Crooked Tree season. When is this going to make it to Michigan?"
"Well done for the style. The only thing that's not completely balanced is the feel, but I love the sticky full body. Nothing is too aggressive or intense, but at no point is there a lack of character. I could drink a lot of this if it was easier to get. It really came from a can? I find that interesting."
"D - yeah, this is a great beer. I don't know how many I could put away in a sitting, but I really enjoy it and it was great to have on tap. Would definitely drink again. Woo DIPA's!"
"I will certainly have this beer again and it has helped to remove the stigma I had placed on canned beers."
"I can't really write anything that hasn't been written already, so I won't bore you with it. I agree with just about every other review. I don't know if it is worth $3.00 a can, but I like it alot. I didn't know what to expect, but I am glad that I tried it."
"Drinkability - I was definitely not expecting this from a canned beer. Oskar Blues I respect your kick ass 2x IPA. Bravo!"
"The beer is a very rich copper color with moderate clarity. It had a finger of thick head that retained nicely and left quite a bit of lacing. The smell is almost nothing but hops, with a slight amount of sweetness coming through as I kept drinking. The taste was very well-balanced, although the hop bitterness was on the forefront. There was a nice sweet malt flavor in the finish with a small amount of alcohol warmth in my throat. The mouthfeel was very nice, and with each swallow I was eager for another sip. I used to look at canned beer as a bad thing, until I met Gordon."
"This pour produced a finger's worth of heavy, thick, off-white head with great retention. As I leaned in for a sniff, I felt my nose hairs ignite and catch fire! I looove hops and this was like mainlining for a jonesing junkie. My mouth began to water and I could barely restrain myself. The smell was like a cross between a newly mowed lawn and licking a pine cone. Yow! The color was a slightly cloudy deep amber. The mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a very piney taste on the tongue. The finish had a pleasantly offsetting malt presence, but this was still mostly hops, baby! My headache began to subside, my blood pressure came down and I was at peace again. This was liquid hit in a can. Groovy!"
"Mouthfeel is full and very soft, carbonation maybe just a touch higher than I'd prefer. Nothing to complain about here, and for the style, exceptionally drinkable. Price was a great value for the quality and style too."
"OK beer in a can. Hmmm. Not so sure. The appearance is a great golden, copper color with a thin white head. The aroma is a piney punch to the face with subtle hints of maltiness. The taste is the same. It's as if you have a pine forest in your mouth. It also had a nice maltines which gave the beer a great balance. I love it! The mouthfeel is a bit heavy with medium carbonation. Overall I was extremely happy with this beer. Beer in a can tasting good. Hmmm, who would have thunk it. Man if we can get this to New Orleans it would be great for Mardi Gras since you can't have bottles on the parade route."
"Drinkability - Fantastic! Went down super smooth. ABV is hidden well. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel-a generous but medium bitterness greets the tongue and stays consistent throughout. Some orangey citrus flavors are there. A good thick resinous mouthfeel- yeah its got some malt backbone. A froth on the palate sweetens the brew and a tea-like sweetness emerges. Not over the top, very assertive with plenty of hops and malt. I hauled this can back from Colorado myself! Cheers!"
"Drinkability - My knees buckled and I fell to the ground for this one. I got way more than I expected, and it held up true to the style. The smooth sweetness helped balance it out oh so well. I'm definitely gonna have to hit up more offerings from oskar blues."
"The argument has been made whether or not this beer is worth $12-$14 a 4 pack, we will find out. Pours to a beautiful dark rich amber brown body. An inch and a half of creamy fat tan head with nice resillance. Slowly fades to leave a thick cream like painting of lace. Nose is laced with phenolic joy including ginger root, fig, vanilla and raw fresh cut vegies, almost creamy. Enters the mouth and the first thing you get is the crisp sweet bread like maltiness. This does give way to a woodsy hop character that is actually creamy and long. A bit os alchol bite jumps off the hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. As the beer warms you get a raw vegtable feel. All in all the bitter effect is not harsh and very complex. Mouthfeel is reallatively soft with a bit of crisp thickness and the desire to take another sip. Drinkability at 8.7% is extremely high. I would pay $3.50 a can for this no problem."
"Drinkability is as high as it is because it is hard to tell the abv% and I wouldn't mind drinking this frequently. Very smooth."
"I wasn't impressed with many of the Oskar beers that I had tried during the night, so I had low expectations for this one. But surprisingly, it was delicious! A well-balanced beer with a good amount of fresh hops. Mouthfeel was average, but the smell was fantastic. Just lots of hops coming through. And I couldn't tell it was as high in alcohol as it was, it was well-rounded. This is one that I would have again."
"Drinkability is moderate, I would like to have seen more of a hop presence here but it scores points for balance, the sweet profile is a little strange (like chocolate and candy mixed) and detracts a bit from drinking in larger quantities, i like Gordon but it definitely falls behind Dale's and Old Chubb IMHO."
"D: Bitterness isn't harsh so it's decently drinkable. I'll try more thanks to the 4 pack."
"Nicely red for a DIPA, tons of lacing, moderate amount of head that retains to a caked on layer. Smell is lots of earthy hops, some citrus, some maltiness in there but hard to distinguish. Taste is much more balanced than the smell would suggest. Nice malt backbone, caramel, toasted malts, floral hops with a wonderfully dry, bitter finish. I've only sampled one other beer from this brewery so far (Old Chub Ale), and I've been really impressed by both of them. I only picked up one this time but I'll be back soon to pick up a six pack."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, prickly carbonation, lots of hops oils in there. Decent drinkability. Not the best example of the style I have had, but it's good."
"I couldn't drink too many of these to be honest, I don't like the aftertaste."
"Flavors are reminding me of Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe IPA and that's a good thing. Rich hop flavors in a mellow citrus kind of way. The flavor type lends to a smooth mouthfeel and experience. Not as mouth puckering as some other examples of the style. The smooth mouthfeel makes for high drinkability. Finishing a serving was easy to do. I'd be happy to have this again."
"This beer pours an orange-amber color from the can with a nice off-white head that laces down the glass. The aroma is of deep sweet malts and citrisy and floral hops that make it a nice double IPA smell. The aroma follows through to the taste. A big bold malty base starts it off with great citrisy, piny, and floraly hops build on top for a great IPA flavor. It has a nice crisp mouthfeel with a nice fresh feeling finish. The drinkability is good, especially for an IPA of this magnitude. Great beer, definately worth a try if it's available."
"If I could acquire this beer here, it would be my go to brew. Simply incredible...."
"12 oz can copped for about $4.00 from Gary's in Madison... heard a lot of good things about this brewery and beer, so I had high hopes for this one... Just recently sampled Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale, and was really impressed - this one is certainly a step-up and one of the better American brews I've sampled... the style is very unique and intricate... the best way to describe it is that it falls somewhere between a highly-hopped IPA and a strong Imperial Red / Amber Ale... nice copper / bronze appearance with minimal head that soon receded... smell was literally bursting with citrus, grapefruit, and hops... the bittersweet aroma really came through on this one, and in addition, was greatly manifested in the taste, as well... Flavor combined the finest elements of both an IPA and an Imperial Amber... great citrus, grapefruit, lemon flavor that included strong florals and fresh fruit notes along with a heavy dose of fresh hops... One of the great American beers, for sure... Great thick, and rich mouthfeel led to an equally good level of drinkability that took a slight bump due to the hefty 8.7% ABV... otherwise, the alcohol is hardly noticeable behind a fresh burst of hops, amber, and grapefruit... Excellent stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Well, being that I drank Ten Fidy before this I was let down by the quality of this compared to that but then I realized it is two completely different styles and I remained a fan of this brewery from what I have seen, not hoppy enough for me but still worth a try"
"D - Not too bad overall, I'd say it's definitely worth a try. Not my favorite for the style, but certainly one of the more well rounded offerings."
"D: Oh yeah! I want more! I wish it was a six pack so I could share with friends and have two or three myself!"
"Had this on tap at the Dirty Truth in Northampton MA. I've had this in cans and always liked it, but on tap it is a very different beer. The appearance is a nice reddish amber and the lacing nice and sticky and persistent. The smell blew me away.... I finally realized what is reminded me of and it was SN Harvest. The hop smell was so full and fresh. Even more flavors came through in the taste, which reminded me even more of the wet-hopped SN harvest. Not sure if this beer is wet-hopped or not, but it certainly tastes like it."
"D- Not extremely stand out, but such a well balanced DIPA it's hard not to like it."
"This is the best beer I've had in a can and one of my favorites overall. Easy to drink and easier to enjoy."
" This is a pumped-up IPA that is highly drinkable, but watch out because that nearly 9% abv will hit after. Gotta dig the can."
"Drinkability: I must admit, I am a Russian Imperial Stout and Belgian Dark Ale man, this was a """walk on the wild side""" for me. Something that was a """cathode""" to my """anode""" taste profile. Be that as it may, I've run through one four-pack and have purchased another. This beer has indeed widened my boundries. Perhaps wide enough to try the Three Floyds Dreadnaught IPA I have in my beer cellar. Well done on all accounts."
"Very good beer from OB.They have not let me down yet."
"Drinkability is above average. Not bad tasting, but not that impressive either. However, it's super smooth, and went down in a hurry, really warming up the cheeks easily. I'd like to try it on fresh draught at the pub to really compare, but as it stands now, am in no hurry to do so."
"D- Really well done, never overpowering or overwhelming, better balance than most. High bittering, but low alcohol presence and great flavors make it a great choice. Not what you'd expect beer from a can to be."
"Excellent beer...."
"D- limited complexity, but very enjoyable, strong points include the scent and mouthfeel; recommended"
"D:Awesome brew. I love anything this great out of a can."
"Mouthfeel is semi-thick and well carbonated. Not one of my favorite hoppy brews but I wouldnt turn this one down if offered again."
"This is a kick ass DIPA. Full of hops and still well balanced. Ill get this again for sure."
"poured into a nonic, this was a slightly hazy deep amber with a creamy, lasting, tan head and lacing. no visible sediment. aromas of caramel, citrus, pine, and honeyed bread. taste was a moderately sweet malt up front with a prominent, lingering spicy bitterness. medium to full in body, with a spritzy mouthfeel and long finish. one of the best, if not the best, canned beers so far. thanks to oxymoron for this one."
"T: Very nice, absolutely well balanced. a little bitter but just the amount you'd hope for. the hop flavor is also well balanced with a slight citrus taste that yields to a mellow maltiness"
"All in all, a solid DIPA, but the price is outrageous. $14.00 for a four pack of cans is ridiculous for this beer. For that kind of money, I would rather buy a Avery Maharaja or DFH 90 Minute and save some money. I won't buy this again at that price. I would buy it on tap if I saw it at a pub though."
"This is a real good sipper, big bodied and bold. I'm going to be enjoying this one for a good while this afternoon."
" Deceptively drinkable, watch out this is strong beer."
"The bite of the hops doesnt make this an easy drinker, yet it is what I like about the beer. A solid DIPA, though a bit overpriced."
" If I could afford to brink this beer every day there's no doubt I would, but well worth the experience."
"Prosit!"
"D-- smooth balanced loads of hops but not too bitter."
"D- A very good beer. A little expensive, but at least this beer shares my name."
"D - High alcohol content and huge flavor reduces the drinkability. It's still pretty smooth and a good brew."
"Well, I have enjoyed this beer for a couple years now so here is one of my less-than-stellar reviews. Nice amber red color with a head that alludes to the gravity of the beer. Smells like fresh pines and hops. The taste is also very piney, hoppy with some tropical fruit flavors and reminds me a lot of Yulesmith winter. These two beers are helping me understand why people call them """Imperial Red""" ales; they are much more malty than a standard DIPA but they still have a super hop element. This is definitely my favorite beer from Oskar Blues"
"Notes: This was a bit pricey (I think I paid $12 or more at Halftime Beverage for the 4-pack), but still, at a little over $3 per 12 oz serving, I'd have to say it's worth it. Worth seeking out if you like Imperial/Double IPAs -- this is one of the smoothest, balanced ones I've had. . . ."
"single can from Bruisin' Ales"
"D: A damn fine DIPA. Expensive (14 per 4-pack), but well worth it. Too bad I can't get more aroud here."
"EDIT: I got this beer fresh as it just came to texas. It is quite a treat fresh. It's hugely hoppy fresh. Have it fresh or age it. It's awesome either way."
"Body is nice and robust with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel accentuated by the pinpoint carbonation. Very balanced, plenty hoppy, and very smooth."
"The taste is more hoppy than my nose leads me to expect. Lots of pine and citrus, a strong malt presence (caramel, chocolate) and some oranges. This is very very drinkable and the mouthfeel is top notch."
"D: I liked this beer. I didnt really know what to expect, but it was different and enjoyable. Definitely recommended."
"Kind of an unclassifyable beer IMO. Not hoppy like a barleywine or an IPA. Too strong for a Pale Ale. I like it a lot because it is kind of unique."
"Sticky mouthfeel and lasting bitter finish. Another great brew from Oskar Blues."
"Brilliantly clear bold red body with a light off white head that fell leaving patches of foam. The aroma is powerful. Strong caramel malt backbone and a wallop of citrusy hops to the face. Oskar Blues turned the hop flavor up to eleven on this one. There is a lot of caramel in the flavor also. Very nice balance. There isn't as much bitterness as I'd expect for a DIPA. The body on this one is good, decently heavy but totally drinkable. Ultimately, I could use a bit more bitterness in this but it's still totally great."
"Since I never had a fresh bottle of this, I can't say if it has improved or degraded over time. I can say that this was pretty tasty, albeit a very different animal compared to today's Gordon in a can. Hops are still present, but muted. Being the hophead that I am, while I've enjoyed this trip down memory lane, I prefer Gordon fresh!"
"Overall a very hoppy and remarkably drinkable DIPA."
"Partly cloudy copper-amber body. Tall, thick, whipped light beige head with excellent lacing. Sticky, resinous hop aroma. Candied apple, toffee, and butterscotch malt backbone. Nice. Pine, resin, and minty hop bitterness up front. Sticky caramel and butterscotch malt sweetness try to break through the hop blockade, but the hops win out in the long and slightly warming finish. Full-bodied, slightly syrupy with a creamy finish. Very nice and I like the can!"
"I like this beer. I dont love it though. I did *LOVE* the barrel aged version on-tap at the brewpub during GABF weekend. If I was to review that version (and I didnt because I wasnt in the beer geek mood) it would have been a solid 5 for taste and drinkability. Still, the normal Gordon is, like I said, good, no it is really good actually it drinks much smaller then a nearly 9% ABV beer. In the future I would rather by Dales Pale Ale if I want hops and an OB beer. Cheers to Oskar Blues for canning a DIPA nevertheless! I purchased a 4-pack at the brewpub this was my last can."
"A bit chewy this one is. The alcohol is hidden well, and the overall body here is good, but the hops are big and almost feel thick. The flavor is quite nice, a big sweet mixture of bitter, but not overly harsh hops with an aroma that'd pull in any hophead. I'd say this might give Surly Brewing's Furious a run for best canned hoppy beer."
"Drinkability-This is a terrific beer. I enjoyed it very much. Although given it's lofty price at around twelve bucks a four-pack, chances are this one will be reserved for special occasions."
"Recommended. This is a nice beer that I can definitely get into. Here's hoping they start sending stuff to California."
"D. Again I review a great beer and have to drop this rating due to regional availability. I have to trade to get this beer, but it is worth it. The abv is high, but I am honestly at the point where 3 beers a night is a big deal. I like the canned beer and I hope this trend continues to grow in the micro market."
"It was as I recalled it but even better. There is a notion within the beer world, in fact stylistically mandated that Double IPAs should be dry to accentuate the hop character. I personally differ. I want an incredibly malt balanced beer that can support a boat load of hops. And that is Gordon, a delicious drinkable hop potion with a clean but full of depth malt character. The flavor profile of this beer is so complex and inviting that it belies the alcohol content entirely. This is a return too often beer. Just waiting for cans to arrive again."
"Beer poured a deep orange with a near perfect white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is nothng but fragrant floral hops, very nice. Taste is very large blast of caramel malts balanced nicely with a large dose of those floral hops. There is a big residual dose of hop resin left on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and quite smooth. Drinkability is quite nice. This is a beer that i can see falling into the ipa2 rotation!"
"Pours a hazy amber, thin white head forms, goes pretty quick, leaves a thin ring, some lace spots. Smell is caramel, citrus, rich hoppiness, floral and light pine, nicely balanced. Taste is sweet, lots of toffee, then big hops follow through the middle, nice grainy feel to it, floral, light fruits, some citrus, nice and malty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty sticky stuff, warms going down. Pretty decent, but would like to try super fresh. Thanks Jan!!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is good. At 8.7%, it's strong, but very smooth. I could definitely drink a few of these. Overall, this is a very good beer. Definitely recommended."
"Oskar Blues has done it again. I want more of this beer right now. Even my non-beer geek roommate was shocked at how good this """canned beer""" was. A real winner; Gordon is great."
"Served in a standard pint glass, deep copper orange color with a perfectly proportioned head. Big aroma of hop resin with each smell. Fruity, flowery, citrus, grapefruit - all classic IPA. Lots of flavor and character, hint of malt but kicked up hoppiness. Bitter, grassy, earthy, make it great tasting and still smooth and easy to drink. This is my new standard for an IIPA, against which all others will be judged."
"The flavor is alot like Dale's Pale: hoppy, citrus-galore, and with a HUGE, sweet malty balance. To be honest, I was expecting a little more hops out of this one. It's not quite as bitter as I had hoped. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great. I'm just nit-picking here. The mouthfeel is exceptionally well-done, with the right amount of carbonation, a medium body, and a nice hoppy finish. For the ABV, Gordon drinks surprisingly well, although the price is a bit steep. Ahh, here comes the alcohol. What a great beer."
"Stunning appearance with a glowing scarlet body, light carbonation, and an ample khaki head. Resinous aroma of those wonderful Amarillo hops and a sort of beefed-up American Brown/Red malt profile. Some nice juicyfruit/peach/strawberry fruit notes and plenty of highly acidic citrus. Oily body with a strong bitterness throughout, but surprisingly, this is not overly bitter in the way that most DIPAs are. Quite drinkable with lots of nice fruit flavors and touches of caramel. A very fine canned beer. Thanks to xmarcnolanx for the taste."
"Great body and mouthfeel here, this goes down VERY easy for a hoppy, 8.7% ABV brew. Another winner from Oskar Blues."
"It's got balls, it's got character, and it's got style, a winning troika. The result is a nicely balanced pint of crafty goodness. It sticks to the ribs, and in spite of a mighty healthy ABV, one is barely gone before you're popping the top on the next. But, beware the morning after if you give in too often. So no, I don't know Gordon Knight, but kudos to him for inspiring this gem."
"Overall I loved this beer. It was very well-balanced, something I wasn't expecting from the style. This was really good stuff and was super easy to drink considering the ABV. I wish I could buy this one around here."
"Taste is very sharp. Again, the pine and earth hints dominate. Reminds me of eating pine needles, with a dash of citrus. Smooth, very nice malt touches on the back. Powerful IPA. I can drink this better in the winter."
"Pours a dark, rich brown amber color with a creamy and fluffy white head that dies down to leave a small layer with plenty of sticky lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is piney and earthy hops. There is a little bit of citrus but not much at all. Taste is of earthy hops with a little bit of bittering. Mostly the taste includes a strong hop presence followed by a malty backbone. Can't really say its balanced, but I can say that its tasty!"
"Pours a burned orange with a creamy head that lasts and laces sheets throughout. Smells of big thick hops, malty and possibly a tiny bit of dried fruit and some citrus. Taste huge hops, then huge malt to balance with a grapefruity finish but not bitter. Mouthfeel is medium with perfect carbonation. Crisp, refreshing, delicious, ABV is non existant. Im liking canned beer more and more."
"Love the can, would love to find this on tap, and love Oskar Blues, but find their APA and Scottish to bring more to the table."
"D - This is another great Oskar Blues product."
"High drinkability for the abv level and style. A great DIPA that does have a metallic touch that brings it down slightly. Additionally, it is overpriced. Very good, but I don't know that it is worth the high price. Still-in-all a robust DIPA that is a must-try, at least once."
"Good stuff! Thanks again jaxon53!"
"Strong and nicely balanced with well-crafted flavors, best beer Ive had from a can to date"
"drinkability is great. very well balanced, this one definitely doesn't seem like 9%. great malt character. wish i had more of this!"
"The beer poured a hazy burnt orange out of the can with a short, light beige head. Very good retention with a bit of sticky lacing. Powedery hop aroma with lots of pine resin and sweet grapefruit in the background. Moderate bitterness, a little low for the style, with a fruity caramel sweetness dominating the foreground. Pine and grapefruit provided a nice hoppy counterpoint for a well balanced flavour. Hops lingered into the finish. A bit of the dry side, medium bodied with moderate carbonation composed of fine, creamy bubbles. An easy drinker, especially when compared to other DIPAs, mainly because of the generous malt content providing a solid balance to the hops."
"Another great beer from Oskar Blues. I've tried three of their offering and everyone was great, not just good, great. Keep canning these brews, I want to try them all."
"One is a real treat, maybe two if you're feeling ambitious. The alcohol is tucked away, but you will definitely feel it after having one or two..."
"D- Great hybrid beer. The DIPA/ strong red combination really works here. Its got a big malty character with good hop flavor. Very easy to drink and the ABV is almost undetectable. Something I will have again."
"D-This is a very flavorful brew....my take is a big amber ale that leans toward the caramel malt but also has some nice sweet juicy hop flavors in the mix...if you want a bitter hop bomb IPA, this is not it....if you want a hell of a tasty big amber ale than you should definitely find some of this. I find it quite enjoyable...."
"Beautiful orange to amber color with a huge, ice cream float head on top. Big and thick, resiny aroma. Screams of tree sap. Very malty with a huge hop flavor but not the bitterness you would expect. Moderate amount of bitterness but against the flavor and malty sweetness the balance is perfect. Good body-very nice finish. Fantastic beer-perfectly balanced all around. Dont know about the high price I have seen it offered for. I got this in a BIF. Still a great, great beer."
"Very very nice. I haven't had a beer yet from Mr. Dale that hasn't hit the spot. Quite drinkable and refreshing for an IPA, yet still very hoppy. Wish this beer was easier to find."
"Cheers to the boys at Oskar Blues. This one is a great beer for a nice venison steak. A very good example of a good style. Definitely worth picking up, and being in a can makes it a perfect choice for some places a bottle won't go easily."
"Anyways, this thing has great hop aroma from the moment you open the can. There is a nice citrus hop flavor, with hints of pine (maybe I'm crazy), but I surely tasted it. This beer is highly drinkable. It would make a wonderful session beer if it were not for the higher alcohol content, which isn't really noticeable due to how well balanced this thing is."
"Overall- This seems more like a regular IPA not a double. Just not big and bold enough for a double but regardless, this is very tasty. Yet another damn good beer in a can."
"I was disappointed that the taste of this beer couldn't give me what I expected from the aroma. For a Double IPA I didn't get that strong side-of-the-tongue bitterness to round it off. Instead the flavor kind of stayed one dimensional all the way through. Worth trying but hard to keep buying it at $4 for just a 12 ounce can..."
"Not overly impressed with this one, and I feel I have had better DIAPAs. It's not bad, and I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't reach for one either."
"First DIPA in a can i've ever tried and a brilliant one for sure. Recommended!"
"Glowing scarlet red appearance. Decent sized creamy white head. Lacing is more than ample with spiderweb like patterns all over the place. Nice blend of malt and hops on the nose. Hops are citric and rind-like in character. And also pungent and smoky. The malts smell of sweet caramel in the background. This is a well balance DIPA. I like the mix of hops and malt, though I could stand to see some more hops. The Dale's is actually more """hoppy""" than this. But this is still good. And very drinkable for the Octane rating. Though I would tend to place this more as a strong ale. The malts give a nice foundation of caramel and toffee. The hops are pungent and oily. Bitterness could stand to use a boost. But overall, this is an enjoyable brew."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one. The high alcohol was almost completely hidden by the sweetness of the malts, and the hoppiness balanced it out quite well. Highly rcommended to Double IPA fans, but be careful. It is 8.7% ABV after all."
"Drinkability- About one of the most well rounded even keeled DIPA's I have had. Nothing really jumps out as outstanding, but it's quality all around for sure. Very easy drinking per style."
"Drinkability - The 8.7% ABV is hidden well. A real good drinker, but at better than $4 a can it was probably a poor choice after a warm ride on the lawn tractor."
"This is an all around good IPA. I had it on tap, but I'd like to try it from the can. It's a clear amber gold beer, looks pretty nice with an ok head. Nose is hops and more hops, as is the taste. Both lack much other than hops, but the actual hop characteristics are varied. Taste has a bit of spiciness as well, and a hint of malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good."
"D-This is an alright brew. A decent 2xIPA that borders on a single. Neither the hops nor the malt stand out for me in any way"
"Best beer I have had from a can to date. Poured from the can into a Chimay glass. A brownish orange color with a fair head and good lacing. The smell is bananna, hops, pine. The taste is sweet hops. The alcohol is well hidden. The hops leave a nice sticky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is great. The abv is undetectable and the beer is so well balanced that 8.7% does not enter your mind. This beer is just too drinkable. The best DIPA that I have had to date. An exceptional brew. Reccomended."
"I've wanted to try this beer for a long time, and to be honest, I'm somewhat disappointed. It's kind of blah. I really like the Dale's, and Old Chub, but sadly, this one really doesn't match up to the hype. Good beer, sure, but not excellent."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, very good representation of style, deceptive kick, this is an excellent beer to stick for a whole evening, but the ABV can catch up to you quickly."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, awesome one-finger plus creamy tannish head, some nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet, malty, nice touch of hops, slight grapefruit/piney, good dose of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, bitter, malty/hoppy. At first the sweetness plays up front, then a nice touch of malts/hops, a nice well balance between the two, the finish is slightly dry/bitter. Medium body. A nice chewy texture. Very drinkable, this is my first Oskar Blues brew, I have a Dale's Pale Ale, and an Old Chub coming in a trade. My can sez 9.8% ABV, just cannot image a brew this high in ABV and flavor coming out of a can, the same with the Surly's. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than is usual in a nice DIPA, but the drinkabilty is outstanding. Smooth and creamy, abv is well hidden. This is one tasty beer. I could drink this all day, any day. Oskar Blues sure as hell know what they are doing with the hoppy beers like this and Dale's. This is about the only DIPA or any other beer that I would pay over $13 for 4 of them."
"A can? I kept having to look back at the can after the pour and shake my head. I couldn't believe something this good from a can. Deep brown with a slight head that formed after I poured it. Not much carbonation present when opening, but it came out in droves afterward. Nutty malt and hops in the nose, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Taste is very complex, both malty and citrusy hops. I didn't taste the alcohol right off like some have mentioned... and I'm usually one to get it right up front. So that says a lot for the taste of the beer overcoming a higher ABV for a really nice offering. Now I can't wait to try the other cans from Oskar Blues."
"Mouth is rich, full, and ever so chewy. Very clean with a medium short finish. Alcohol has no presence in this beer. Could drink this all night, at least until the 8.7% ABV snuck up on me."
"Taste of raw US hops, citric and little grapefruity, but not sharp. A nice bitterness which is supported by a medium dextrinous, sweet maltiness. Not the most bitter DIPA I had, but this beer seems to be toned down in every taste direction. Not only are the hops mild and flavorfull instead of mouthpuckering, but also the malt sweetness isn't as syrupy as other DIPA's. Personally I think that this beer is a great example of the style."
"Poured into a pit glass, pours a orange amber color with a minimal fluffy head that leaves some heavy and thick lace on the glass. Smell is quite outdoor wood and bark also a bit of grapefruit. Taste is pretty impressive has a sweet nectar hoppy taste with a bit of a malt and alcohol finish that is not overbearing, this is not as hoppy as I thought it would be but nicely balanced between the hop bitterness and the malt backbone and the alcohol sweetness, this is highly drinkable for its high abv and is almost like a meal in a can. This is one fine damn offering and one that I would purchase again, pretty pricey though for the 4 pack but worth every penny."
"dale's pale ale on steroids for sure. 14.99 a four pack hurts, but it pours a geourgeous dark amber orange with a massive head that has pretty good retention and lots of nice lace. citrusy and piney like a dipa should be. just not as thick as i like. sticky and redish for sure, but not as creamy as i dreamed it would be. in my experience, freshness is the key with this one. i could session this one, but 14.99 hurts bad."
"A solid, but not exceptional DIPA. The hops aren't super out-of-this-world, but it's fairly rich without being sickly sweet. As much as I like dry, straight-up-bitter DIPAs like Ruination, this one deserves credit for its smooth drinkability. Outrageously priced at Bukowski's at $7!"
"Overall, very good. By far the best beer from a can I've ever had. I prefer a more bitter hoppiness, but this is a well made DIPA. Recommended."
"Drinkability - An easy drinker thats at home with BBQ, as it would be in the dead of winter, as a nice warmer."
""""Can'o bliss. Satisfy Ya.""""
"Mouthfeel is fully bodied and oh so smooth and creamy. This is one of the smoothest beers that I've had in a while, and that only increases the drinkability for me. I picked this up at total wine and more is Sterling, Va and I'm glad I finally had a chance to try it. I just hope that I'll have another chance to have this again."
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Medium to full body with medium carbonation."
"D: The novelty of this beer is that it doesn't kill the palate, yet gives you a mellow hop kick that does little harm. For that, I salute Oskar Blues for this offering; its appearance was enticing, its flavor was unique, and it makes for a very practical beer."
"D: A very good DIPA - it draws instant comparisons to another canned winner, Surly Furious. I think I may like Gordon a little better than the Furious, but who's comparing? One I'll like having again (recently found at a local bottle shop) and certainly recommend. Bonus points for portability in the aluminum can and for having the same name as my Dad."
"Pours a beautiful crisp copper hue with a nice one finger white fluffy head that dies down to a thin layer for the remainder of the tasting. Stickiness/legs are pretty good, here and/or there. Smell is an oily piney hop with a bit of pale malt in the background. Very complex odor, really enjoy it. Taste seems to be a bit weaker than the smell a bit of a disappointment. Starts off with an bitter pine hop and ends with a slick earthy malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with hardly any carbonation. Probably not a good idea, but this may become my next golf beer. I don't sense much alcohol at all. Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance. FORE!"
"Drinkability: A solid DIPA, although sweeter than I generally prefer. And you have to love the idea of a DIPA from a can."
"Got just a single can of this at Murray's in Milwaukee and i wish that i had picked up more. Pours big, red and sticky. Nice off-white cloud of a head. Smells lemony and freshly hoppy. Very inviting. Smells as fresh as if it had just come out of a tap at the brewery. Taste is creamy, sweet, hoppy and grassy. Bitterness doesn't hit until the finish and then its oh-so-smooth. This is a fantastic-tasting beer. Mouthfeel is creamy like its been slightly whipped-up. full bodied. An amazing beer all around and a fantastic argument for putting all beer in cans (also see: Surly Brewing)"
"I can see the allure to this in the can. Would thrwo this one in my backpack when camping."
"D - drinkable beer, as it warms the taste of alcohol becomes more pronounced, but it still deserves a 'good' rating."
"I picked this up on a recent trip to Milwaukee. It reminds me more of a barleywine than a DIPA, very malty instead of over-the-top hoppy. A pretty good beer even if it wasn't what I'd hoped for."
"Finish was slightly bitter, but not as much as expected. This was a darn good beer!"
"Note: This is 8.7% ABV, so WATCH OUT! It is obscenely easy to drink, no alcoholic flavors or aromas..."
"Excited to try this out after a representative from Oskar Blues came to our homebrewers meeting this week. The guys took it easy on the questions because she was pretty new to the craft beer scene (plus she was cute). Amber ceoor with high carbonation. Not as hoppy or tart as expected, malts must have balnced them out somewhat. Easy to drink the sample. However, the cost for a four pack vs. a six pack of their Dale's Pale and Old Chub makes it my third favorite (out of three) from Oskar Blues. Still happy to see more craft beer in cans available here."
"Gordon is the best way to spend a sunny day on the course ."
"Cloudy brown, it came to me with a thin head. Aroma was not particularly noticeable but was fairly hoppy. Taste is not complex and has a strong alcohol bite, making it taste almost like a liquor than a beer. Thick and smooth, it has some bitterness in the aftertaste but is still pleasant to drink. This is a beer to be sipped slowly and savored rather than chugged down."
"Drinkability: Extraordinarily well-balanced, just as it's secondary Dale's Pale Ale is. A beer good enough to help you pull yourself up out of the muck and make your life something worth living. Thanks a million, Oskar Blues!"
"D- Too drinkable for the ABV! Very good, deceptavly strong."
"Quite a great beer across the board. This is one that I have to be in the mood for, but when I am, it is fantastic."
"drinkability - Not bad, not bad. Nice balance here. Malt meets Hops. 4 pack for $8? I have other beers I would spend my money on. Not sure why it cost so much. Worth a try though. Though the Scottish Ale that they make, now that I buy a lot of."
"Caramel malt flavors abound. A kiss of honey and buttery crackers provide a solid body for some sharp-edged, grapefruit-like bitterness. The alcoholic kick transports me back many years ago when my aunt Sylvia used to allow me a taste of her Manhattan Martini. As a bonus, I got the martini soaked cherry."
"A very drinkable DIPA. This beer straight from the can around a campfire would be Nirvanah."
"D - Meh, its taste is all medicinal - definitely not something I would want to have again, but at least it is finishable. Smells nice."
"MF/D - One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. A lot of my experience with this style has been a lot of overhyped, overhopped beers, but this one really did it for me. Very balanced, true to the style, exactly what all """extreme""" beers should strive to be. Highly reccomended."
"D- It is a good DIPA. I don't think I am going to try and trade for one but if I saw it I may pick it up."
"Good for it's style with lots of hops and balancing malt, and a very good balancing act. A potent lacey mix with cloudy yellow and beige head. Hoppy """C"" aroma. Some citrus, drying aftertaste.This is an aged version, we went back one year, and it worked."
"I've had Dale's Pale Ale and enjoyed that so I figured that with the reputation of this one I had to try it. In fact, I was lucky to find it in my opinion seeing there were only two four packs and a single left from what I saw. Expensive but well worth it in the end which I'll get to. Pours a nice reddish orange with a good head. It stayed around throughout at about 1/4 inch...from a can. Big. Red. Sticky. All pretty true from what I can see. Sweet caramel and biscuity malts that are already tempting hit the nose along with hops. They aren't quite as up front as you'd expect but I'm still enjoying this. The taste of this is amazing. Very well balanced hops and malts, sweet without that overpowering bitterness from the hops I've come to expect. Instead, the hops simply seemed to peak through at the end, making this quite tasty. Carbonation is close to ideal for the mouthfeel which also happens to be silky smooth. Medium and closer to light bodied brew along with the taste make this the most drinkable of a big bunch that I've tried. Overall a great DIPA and another solid offering from Oskar Blues."
"As I wrap up the glass, I certainly want another one. The nice malt balance and the pine sappy finish are quite agreeable and make this a surprisingly drinkable concoction. They come in a four-pack, and I think I would have no reservations about going for the lot of them. A treat. Though its classifed as a DIPA on BA, I find it more in line with Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster, which is labeled an imperial red. Splitting hairs, but that sounds more accurate to me."
"That said, unlike many other big IPA's that slap you down with raspy hops and loaded bitterness, this one is soft like a baby's blanket. It's rich malty base is the perfect support for it's resiny hop load. It's caramelish, and even slightly chocolatey, but perfectly balanced by the softly piney and grassy hops. The bitterness is even soft. It's 85 IBU's are barely felt - against the plush malt background it seems more like 35 or 40!!! It's remarkably rich and mellow at the same time... hoppy, but not so hoppy... malty but not sweet. IT'S RIDICULOUSLY GOOD! And stunningly drinkable!!! And I have to say this, but not because of the can thing, although that's great and I'm all for it, and excited that it's catching on, but... this is one hell of a beer for relaxing around the campfire with. It reminds me of my homebrew club camping trips... big, soft, hoppy beers - and you only need one or two because they satisfy. Good times! Oskar Blues keep doing it!!! It takes a lot to turn my head, but damned if this one didn't do it! Highest praises! ...Now I need to go get more!!!"
" Body is thick and syrupy, something I usually dislike, but here I find it rather pleasant and very appropriate. After about half the can it does become kind of a chore to drink, but this is a pretty intense beer. Does my name proud."
"A solid DIPA with great balance makes this an easy drinking brew. Easy to enjoy more than one in a sitting, although $13 for a 4-pack is a little prohibitive when I can get comparable beers for $8-$10 for a six pack."
"Worth a try."
"Pours a very pretty amber with some darker brown depths. Tight-bubbled head that leaves a bit of lace. Fresh, green hop aroma with lots of pine notes backed by graham crackery sweet malts. On the palate, sharp acidic bite of hops first off, then some malty sweetness. Towards the end it gets considerably hotter with some raw alcohol and hop oils, which skew toward the piney side. There's some great length here -- the finish lasts a long time, and features some fruity citrus notes that aren't present in other parts of the palate. Big, rich mouthfeel with only light carbonation; the overall impression is heavy -- just shy of syrupy. Overall, this is a very good double IPA, with some good hop flavors, a nice balancing malt bill, and some smoothness. Quite drinkable and tasty."
"Poured a deep, dark, hazy orange, with a very nice white head which faded down leaving a nice lace up the glass. Very nice pour from the can. The smell was a nice blend of citrus hops. Grapefruit and pineapple being the biggest players here with hints of tangerine and pine flavors. Alcohol also made its presence felt, tingling the nose a bit. The taste was nice and sweet, not overally so but well rounded sweetness. Nice citrus flavors again, pineapple and grapefruit. The alcohol again was noticeable, but as it warmed it was masked well by the flavors. Very nice bitter, dry finish, lingered and made you want more of it. The balance between the malt and hop flavors is very nicely done here, and the compliment each other well, and mask the high ABV nicely. Overall this was a very nice DIPA and another quality brew from Oskar Blues."
"Goes down way too easy."
"Very good DIPA overall. I hope they start distributing this in NC pretty soon. The only complaint I have is the price...a bit too pricy in my opinion."
"Pours well out of the can. Rich and creamy one-finger head atop an amber-hued body. The foam fades relatively quickly, but doesn't entirely dissolve. Wow, what an aroma for a DIPA! Smooth and sweet, but not the piney, citrusy aroma I have grown accustomes to associating with most big IPAs. This one has a very strong caramel presence in the bouquet. A bit musty too. Kinda like the Old Chub in both respects. They couldn't possibly use the same yeast strain for both the Chub and the Gordon could they? It's probably just the malts used. Either way, it creates a fantastic aroma and a pleasant surprise for an IPA of this magnitude. The hops are clearly present in the taste. Mellow and chewy, with a nice smooth hoppy bitterness. Some chocolate and coffee. Definitely some caramel seeping in at the edges. This is a fine IPA, but definitely not my favorite. They do a nice job masking the alcohol here, but it could really come back to haunt you if you're not careful. Overall, a nice beer, but I'd gladly take an Old Chub over this one just about any day."
"Cheers!"
"T: Yum. That's it. I'm a fan of malty IPA's and this one does the trick. Really well balanced with hop vs. malt. Citrus front that blends with vanilla, orange, and a yeasty feel. Slight bitterness throughout that slims slowly. Red goodness from a can and at $10 a four pack I'm going to go broke."
"I'm a big fan of Dale's Pale Ale so I had to try a four pack of Gordon even though it was $10.99. It poured a nice red color with a solid two inch head. Excellent hoppy aromas. The malt background did not give in to the high IBU's, nor did it create a warming flavor. I would say it is well balanced, but I typically like the hops to be a bit stronger than the malt in this style (e.g. Hercules Double IPA or 90 Minute IPA). A solid offering, but definitely not a session beer at 8.7% ABV. I still prefer Dale's Pale Ale as my standard."
"This great little can was courtesy of blitz134. Thanks!"
"Pours with lovely colour and fairly substancial head. Clear but deep caramel amber colour. Incredibly hoppy aroma. Green and fresh hops. Certainly doesn't taste the almost 9%, balanced and plenty hoppy. Carbonation good, with bitterness well under control. Really nice composure. This drinks like a regualar IPA. Sterdy malt in the backbone, this is the best beer I've had from a can. Big thanks Harry!"
"Gordon pours a hazy reddish copper with a tan head that leaves a thick lace as it recedes. It came in a twelve ounce can. The aroma could be better and stronger. Taste on the other hand is nice, there is a strong caramel malt flavor and a strong resiny hop flavor balancing nicely against it. Best beer I've ever had out of a can, hands down. Definitely worth a try."
"Very enjoyable, easy drinking DIPA."
"Notes: hmmm. Definitely unexpected flavorwise. I really wonder if this should be listed as more of an American strong ale or maybe an amber. Either way this is simply a tasty brew and definitely something nice to sip on for a while."
"I was expecting a little more judging from some of the ratings but now that I look at the overall average...I guess my opinion isn't too far off base."
"Don't let the can and weird, generic-looking labeleing fool you. This is a wonderful beer worth seeking out."
"The can adds real appeal. I'd love to show up somewhere with a sixer of this stuff, but it's so pricey in Wisconsin. An easy drinker for 8.7 percent ABV."
" Go out and try this...preferable at cellar temperature or about 55 degrees"
"An excellent beer, though expensive at over $3.50/12 oz. Alcohol catches up to you after not too long, and so this is definitely not to be consumed in bulk."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thick sticky white head. The aroma is a perfect 5! There are fresh hops-a-plenty in the nose with a nice backing of sweet malt. Upon the first sip, the deliciously citrus and piney hops just explode in your mouth! Behind the delicious hops there is a very nice malt backbone that keeps you craving more. The mouthfeel is medium-full with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, this is certainly right up there with any of the top IIPA's in the world. Outstanding!"
"Overall this is a fine Double IPA and even neater considering it's in cans. Bring this on your next fishing trip and surprise your buddies."
"App. - 4, Smell - 4, Taste - 4.5, Mouth - 3.5, Drink - 4.5"
"Drinkability: a great beer here. For those places bottles won't cut it - this is the beer to get, but don't forget the higher alcohol content."
"D - Not as overly hoppy as I expected, but definitely more balanced than other DIPAs I've had lately; sweeter than most others, too. I can see this making for a good session beer, if there is such a thing for DIPAs."
"Cheers."
"Damn fine beer from a can, via trade with JAYW. Deep, dark, and thick in appearance; not much air escapes when I crack the can, and I think the thick malts could use a touch more carbonation, which brings down the drinkability. It's sticky, resiny beer, and in a very good way. Mostly cascade hops carry the bitterness, which is full of lively dried fruits. A bit chewy. I'd recommend this one very cold. Reminiscant of Pete's Wicked Ale circa 1994, but definately taken up a notch or two. A good call for hopheads who like a malty full body, and a fine brew to help smash sterotypes and redefine the can. Cheers!"
"This was good stuff in the end. It's very drinkable, full of flavour and just well crafted. It's a bit of a different Double IPA. It doesn't smack you over the head with huge flavour or an overabundance of hops, but instead comes at you with a solid, well balanced amount of flavour. Good stuff."
"Oddly enough, the body doesn't seem to be as big as with the Dale's. Could be the perception of alcohol and the fact that the creaminess isn't as noticeable. Drinkability suffers due to higher gravity and less smooth bitterness. Still a good beer, but I stand by my statement that I'd drink a Dale's over this anyday."
"I may fall more in the minority with my review. Fascinating beer in a can for sure. Way to far into the pine hop effect for my preferences. The nose and taste were predominantly pine. A touch of light to medium bodied malts support the pine but to me it was all about the pine. I prefer more of a citrus / pine to citrus combination."
"d - easily drinkable and a very warming finish. oskar blues always does a great job. war eagle, dale."
"Pours a ruddy amber with not much of a head. Some spotty lacing. Smell is very nice- a beautiful whiff of apricots followed by some earthy maltiness and a touch of hops. The taste is extremely dry for the style with subdued hops up front, some thin malt, and a late hit of fruit followed a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is too thin for me, but contributes to the dryness. No stickiness, instead a little bit of tannins at the end. Pretty drinkable due to its dry nature, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden."
"D - The alcohol is completely hidden. A very tasty and drinkable DIPA. I hope to see more tasty beers like this in a can."
"Thick mouthfeel partly from malt and partly from hop oils. Modest carbonation works well with the character of this beer."
"This is really a fantastic beer. I love the Old Chub but wasnt crazy about the Dales Pale Ale, but this, this is really spectacular. The oily hops are balanced just right against the malt making it very reminiscent of Three Floyds. Great beer. Im glad they come in 4 packs. :-)"
"Cans are good."
"A solid offering in a convenient package!"
"Deep amber color with a coppery hue. Medium creamy head holds nicely and reduces leaving tons of sticky lacing along the sides. Aroma is intense with a resiny piney hoppiness. Some sweeter fruity flavors. But the grapefruit and pine dominate and almost burn when I smell too closely. Nice. Taste is just as good but smoother than I expected. Lots of hoppy flavor but bitterness is held in check by a firm malt foundation. The malts a bit sweet which counters nicely with the acidity and almost tea-like herbal qualitites of the hops. Very resiny in the back with a piney finish. Very smooth and some cream elements give this beer great drinkability, esp. considering the abv and the style. I love the can too. This brewery has continued to impress."
"Taste almost lives up to the nose, it's quite crisp and light, but lacks a little bit of depth that the nose has. More piney and woodsy flavors, a tiny bit of sweetness peeks through. Mouthfeel is, again, light. Amazingly light. This is a highly, highly drinkable DIPA. Very sneaky in the alcohol department, flavorful, refreshing... and in a can! Gotta love that. Lovely."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, one that I enjoy again and again--but not at one session. The alcohol is evident, no enticement to chug this one. One of my favorite DIPAs."
"Pours an amber to copper color and clear with a fairly small cream colored head that fades back to a ring. Aroma is sweet grapefruit, orange sweetarts, and a sweet berry smell. Taste follows with a mix of citrus and berry that is cut by a steady and slightly dry bitterness that lingers nicely. Light to medium body, somewhat lighter malty feel, fairly smooth texture up front mixes with a peppery zing of hops and a bitterness that hits the back of the tongue. Nice dipa, quite easy to drink."
"All in all, an excellent beer, though not my type. If I'm in the mood for a great beer from a can, I'll probably stick with Dale's Pale Ale or Brooklyn Lager."
"Awesome brew! I am eternally grateful to cburian for providing me the opportunity to try this great brew outside the state of CO. Thanks, Chris!"
"This pours deep amber with an off-white head exhibiting the thickness that seems to be a trademark for this Lyons, Colorado craft brewery. The smell is absolutely amazing. This is one of the most aromatic, floral hoppy beers I have ever smelled. It practically smells like burying your nose in a couple handsful of hops. Amazingly, under all that floral scent there is significant malt to be smelled as well. The taste is not as hoppy as the smell would indicate; must have been a very large and late hop addition. Its a big beer, with rich honey malt flavors and piney, sappy bitterness. The higher alcohol content is detectable in the mouth as a warming feeling during the long bitter finish. All in all, a very balanced beer (in the taste, if not the nose). Big beer, big abv%, big price, but well worth it."
"While certainly above average, this wasn't sensational IMHO. I am very glad, however, that I tried it. I bit expensive, though, for what it is."
"Oskar Blues really amazes me. Around here they were never heard of, and all of a sudden show up with 2 beers, in CANS, that are amazing. I'm glad that I finally got my hands on some of thier Gordon, which I have been looking for. A great beer, from a brewery that I very much respect for quite a few reasons. I do wish that it was a little cheaper.... $14 for a 4 pack is a little steep, but I do think that this is worth it. Very enjoyable, and highly recommended."
"Poured a nice burnt orange color and a much fluffier head than I was expecting. It appeared very syrupy in the glass. The smell was immediate grapefruit/citrus and the first sip was much of the same. The hop bitterness is very good and the drinkability is high for a beer with such a high alcohol content. Delicious brew and looking forward to trying this one again."
"10-ounce goblet at Pizza Plant on Transit Rd. Hazy dark amber with golden highlights and a densely-packed, small onionskin-colored head. Beneath a powerful sugary spruce sap and citrus rind aroma lies the scent of a vaguely fruity ester and caramel malts. Massively bitter citrus flavor up front (grapefruit, mandarin rind, etc.) quickly gives way to a slightly alcoholic, strawberry-mango-inflected caramel malt sweetness. Pine, grapefruit, and vegetal cannabis flavors all appear in the scorching burps. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and juicy all at once. The 9.2% alcohol content is certainly noticeable, but not in any way that inhibits enjoyment of the other flavors. A DIPA that isn't syrupy or cloying is always a keeper in my book. And it really is a damn good DIPA. If one wanted to exemplify a classic of the style, one needn't look much further than Gordon here."
"M/D- This beer is nice and thick syrupy, and slightly chewy...coats the tongue and leaves you a lot to think about long after you finish the sip...This beer deserves a 5 on drinkability, but at $3.99 a 12oz can all I can give it is a 4.5....but none the less a great beer that will venture in to my fridge many times this winter."
"This beer had a little too much carbonation for my taste on the first poor from the growler. The next day was much better. Drinkability was so, so. It's an enjoyable beer, but I didn't want to consume much more than one glass at time. As I mentioned before, it could use a little more balance. To me it just didn't have the right hop flavor for it to stand alone on them. I've heard this is a better beer when pouring for a can. Maybe I'll track some down and re-review."
"recommended, and just as good as i remember from the old days of gordon bottles."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of medium bodied. The beer isnt sticky. This is a dam fine beer that hides its alcohol well. I could easily see kicking back a few of these in a evening."
"D- goes down easily, after having a whole 750 I am a bit buzzed, an excellent beer, i would love to be able to find in a can"
"When I poured this beer not much of a head but the aroma could smell five feet away! Though the small head still laced the glass all the way to bottom. The nose had a nice grapefruit and sweet lemony with a soft floral finish. mouthfeel was med. to full body with hints of amareto and dusted peacans. The finish was a little spicy with a vanilla coffee finish. Best beer in a can I've tried!"
"Drinks very easy for the abv & ibus. The only thing that would keep this out the rotation is the cost $10.99 a 4 pack. Seems much smoother when compared to the draft, having said that. it was a pretty young batch. Another can of goodness from this brewery. I liked this about .5 more than tap version for what it's worth"
"This beer pours a ruby amber with a frothy just off white head. The smell is mostly hops backed up by some sweetness. The hops seem to be of the centennial varietal. The taste falls short of the smell. This is a major malt bomb. The hops have a hard time shining through all of the pale malts. It is still tastey, just not hoppy. The mouthfeel is full and thick, with nice carbonation. Overall, its drinkable, just not a great IPA."
"Big sweet hoppy flavor that attacks the taste buds with a mix of sweet and bitter. There's a huge toasted malt balance that reminds me of 90 Minute. Very dry bitter finish from all of the wonderful fresh tasting hops. A good beer although not all that complex."
"Drinkability: Definitely a highly drinkable beer. In my opinion, not too far off from Dale's. More hop character, though it would probably stand out more on tap (rather than in a can). Another great one from Oskar Blues."
"This beer poured a deep reddish amber color with a small head that left a bit of lace on the glass. Upon cracking the can open I caught a huge whiff of fresh hop flower aromas. Very enticing for a full blown hophead like me. Sweet malt aromas came later along with some peach and citrus notes. Taste was quite hoppy, but there was also a very good malt backing with this beer that went along well with flavors of peach, apricot and grapefruit. Mouthfeel was medium bodied on the palate. Alcohol was not really too apparent for a beer that is 9.2 percent. Overall, another very nice offering from the canned beer craft brewery that continues to impress me. Ordered online from Vintage Cellar in VA."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4""" tan head over the slightly cloudy copper brew. Head is dense and lasting, with tons of sticky lacing. Aroma is defined by resinous hop character. Taste starts with a heavy malt sweetness, which is quickly cut to the quick by the incisive piney hops. Certainly can't call it well balanced, but the flavors are quite complementary. Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, especially for a style that can sometimes abandon flavor for sheer bitterness. Glad I have a couple more of these in the fridge..."
"Let me preface my review by saying I was very skeptical of paying $15 bucks for a 4 pack in a can, I said to myself """ whoa thats more than the 4 pack of Founders Breakfast Stout.""" So, this beer had a lot to prove and boy did it ever. Appearance is a very dark brown with a bit of orange hue around the edges with a white creamy head, you know similar to a guiness head with little to no bubbles. Smells of sweet citrus with some alcohol esters are the first to hit the nose. Taste is incredible citrus hops with none of the alcohol burn that might be expected with the alcohol esters in the nose. I could drink a 4 pack but with the 9% and the big price tag I keep a couple of these in the stash."
"Pours a dark brown, copper in appearance with a clear body that leaves a thick tan head. The aroma is very nice, pine, sharp earthy tones, tarragon, lots of herbs throughout the nose. This brew brings a toffee sweetness lots of malt which is needed to balance this hop bomb. The taste is very herbal, bitter hops upfront spicy and delicious. There is a slight anise presence to this brew, rounded by a chewy bitter pine feel that roughs up your palate. In the finish there is a sweetness of caramel with a pine cone bitterness after taste. This is a good IIPA but not worth the $3.99/can."
"A devilishly drinkable IPA. I found the canned version to be slightly less assertive than the draught verson. Slightly more mellow, yet every bit as enjoyable taste-wise. This one is not cheep, however, at 15 bucks for four cans. This makes it about the same value on draught as can. If I can find again on the tap lists, I will be likely to get it."
"D - Although I like this beer, it is not exactly real drinkable. It's one and done for me."
"Forget about the can, this is a good, solid (if overly sweet) version of my favorite style of beer. If I had read my own review prior to tasting, I wouldn't have been thrilled with the emphasis on cararmel malt. In the drinking however, Gordon is a big, gooey, friendly sort of DIPA that I'd probably buy on a regular basis if I was fortunate enough to live in Oskar Blues's distribution area. Thanks to hopsaplenty for the opportunity."
"D: Highly drinkable dipa, but I may be overplaying this as I'm just so happy it's in a can. I would definately grab this again, although it's a tad expensive for both a 4 pack or 1 of them."
"In finish, this is a great double IPA that could be even greater. I applaud Oskar Blues for their canning initiative. I like beer in cans!"
"The body is very smooth and a dare I say creamy. I think this almost distracts the hoppiness from the beer though. Overall I was impressed with the taste, and shocked at the high price, it was still worth it."
"The smell is a nice blast a hops. Grapefruit, citrus, and floral smells are everywhere. The taste brings more of these flavors all the way through. The mouthfeel is solid and pleasing while drinkability is very good."
"good drinkability and i gotta say, the least in your face double IPA i've ever had. don't let that give you the wrong idea though, it's still loaded with hops and very good."
"Finish is more alcoholic than I'd like. Normally I hope that bite is more subdued, even for a beer of this strength. It interferes with drinkability for me, and turns this into a sipping 1 per sitting type of beer."
"If you can find it, get some. The supply in cans is up and down throughout Colorado. Supply has not nearly kept up with demand."
"A nice DIPA with some balance, Oskar does it again."
"Abundant fruit mixed with the barleywine feel in the flavor, an impressive acheivement. Wonderful, relaxing ale, this. And, without a doubt, the finest beer I've yet poured from a can!"
"Happy to get to try this one on tap @ Hop Devil, Lower East Side NYC, pours a dangerous brownish plum tone, cloudy with a nice tiny bubble film and leaving loads of fine, sticky, sheets of lacing, nice....the expected resiny hop nose, leads to waves of buttery hoppy goodness, creamy, smooth, malt rising to support the hop blast. Full bodied, full flavor, heady, American in attitude brew! Simply lovely stuff, in cans this would be the ultimate beach or camping in the cooler beer. Where can I get cans of this stuff in the NYC area?"
"Bottom line: another very good DIPA to put on my list of go-to beers. And, apparently it's avaialble in cans, so it'll be a great camping beer if I can find a case."
"Poured aclear rich bronze with a nice white sticky 1/2 finger head leaving a ring of lace as it settled slowly,I know giving a 5 for for anything really means something when reviewing but I had it give this a perfect score for the nose of this bad boy the pine jumps out and grabs ya the underlying citrus just adds to to it its just resiny and piney and just damn good.Long lingering hops on the palate no big wallop and done here a nice coating mouthfeel the piney flavors just coat the mouth and just seem to linger over top of a pretty sweet malt base but the hops seem to just go on late into the finish inducing those blessed hop burps.Big thanks to my buddy Dale aka """hoppedup""" (Dale) thru AK Smoked Porter hey every once in awhile even an Ohioan makes me happy."
"Notes: I've had it on tap at Oskar Blues and I really liked it. This one isn't quite as good, probably due to the flaws in the brewing/fermentation process. Its sweet, but not cloying, the hop flavor is good, but could be stronger, and would like some more bitterness."
"Drinkability: My second Oskar Blues beer, and I can honestly say this beer has no ill effects from canning whatsoever, and is an above average DIPA."
"Notes: This is another Oskar Blues beer that hides it's alcohol content quite well. 9.2% is not what I would have expected from the flavors. The dryness on the finish is quite pleasant and it makes this a beer that is very easy to drink."
"This is a seriously rich and delicious DIPA. It has a wonderful body and sweetness without being the least bit syrupy, and is one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced in the style. The taste is of strongly citrusy hops, a smililar hop profile to Dale's Pale Ale, but is nicely balanced by the residual sweetness. Very strong effort by Oskar Blues, and I wish we got the cans here in New England."
"A bit thin for a double IPA. Carbonation is about right though. Alcohol is not present in the least. Very very smooth drinking for such a high alcohol IIPA. Also, incredibly balanced in a category of beer that is dominated by over the top hops."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a powerful hop aroma that's floral and quite refreshing. The taste is good. It has a nice bitter hop taste that is complimented with a complex malt flavor. It goes down easy and finishes hoppy and slightly warm. This is a big brew with lots of flavor. It's rich and well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's all around good; another wonderful offering from these guys."
"A very drinkable DIPA that is almost in the top 1% of its class but not quite yet. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and filling with a mellow creamy carbonation. This one floats down with immense ease and not sign of the over 9% abv contained within. I'd say this is a darn drinkable DIPA. I could go for another and wouldn't mind killin a whole 4 pack if I had it. Cheers to Oskar Blues for canning some great beer, I hope more breweries will branch out into canning as well! Thanks to warriorsoul for this tasty treat."
"Big dry hopped nose with lots of floral and citrus notes. The first thing you notice is a big grapefruit flavor it slowly fades away to a nice matly flavor. As the malt flavor leaves your pallet it leaves a dry alcohol flavor. There is also a very sweet note to the beer it leaves me wishing it was a little drier. But other then that a very good DIPA."
"After reading some of the reviews of this brew I noticed the bottled versions were all very dark in color...could have been reformulated at some point since canning and kegging. Appears caramel amber hued with a nice sized cream head leaves even bands of lacing with each sip. Aroma contains citrus earthy hops coming off nice and herbally spiced heavy hand sweetness from the caramel malt base wtih a touch of alcohol present in the smell. Flavor seems upfront with the caramelly doughy tone with assertive bitterness tailing to balance quality citrus and earthy hops with a signature yeasty Oskar Blues finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated quality texture light hop oils not quite resinous. Drinkability is very nice dangerously drinkable beware of the abv effortless and balanced DIPA get some cans off this to pair with your tackle box this summer and you may just fall off the boat."
"D: This is an addicting beer. A good all around beer, no huge remarkable qualities, but lots of good consistent qualities make me keep on sipping this. I will buy again, and I will be sad when I finish this glass."
"-UF"
"12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Nice off-white head and mohagany in color. The smell is sweet and fruity with nice floral, citrius hop follow through. Very nice smelling DIPA. The taste is very much on the hoppy side, but has good sweet malt backbone and finishes with a nice bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is very good. The alcohol is very well hidden and the can is also very cool. This has been a go to beer for me since it appeared in GA this year."
"An experiment perhaps...."
"Dark color considering the style. Light tan head that laces quite well. A very nice looking beer. Bright and vibrant aroma. Fresh floral, pine and spruce. Dry hopped with other notes of green apples and cherries in the nose. This is truly a delightful beer. Its a hop monster and displays all kind of fresh, floral and sprucey hop flavor but its bitterness is subdued. Tons of flavor. Very creamy and full bodied. Canned version just lacked the magic, or maybe I'm just crazy. I just remember the old Gordon being better,"
"The 12oz were gone almost before I knew what had happened. An astoundingly well-balanced American IPA."
"One of the best beers in a can Ive had. This beer will definitely change perceptions about what canned beer can be."
"From the 12 oz. can, I poured this beer into a standard 16 oz. pint glass. The beer came out very highly carbonated with a two to three finger tall head that prevented the emptying of the entire contents in on pour. The underlying body was reddish amber in color, which was a departure from standard issue DIPAs. There was also some yeast in suspended animation in the glass. The aroma was very mild for the style with a sweet toffee-ish nose and some spicy hops. The alcohol was also evident in a mildly fumy manner. Taste was little too sweet for what it was meant to be with the mildly bitter and earthy hops providing only a slight contrast. This beer had a pleasant caramelized and balanced taste, but much closer to a concentrated English Bitter in flavor profile than a bulked up American IPA. Nice toastiness and nutty flavors also reinforced the impression that this was off style by quite a bit. The cloyingly sticky and slick mouthfeel lacked the bright punch I so love in the real Western hop monsters built on pale malt base. Alcohol was also too detectable in the aftertaste. Enjoyable but flawed, and overpriced to boot. A decent beer, but not a good DIPA."
"Bottom line: A double ipa that brings the hops but also kicks in with a huge malt backing...this is *great* stuff!!"
"Drinkability: Not what I was expecting from a DIPA. This is not a big, hoppy DIPA in the Hop Wallop or Clipper City Loose Cannon vein. Has a well pronounced malty sweetness that offsets any hoppiness. Alcohol is well pronounced, leaving a warming face. Glad I was able to get this limited edition offering in a can. If you like a sweeter DIPA than a big hoppy DIPA, then Gordon is for you. Worth a try if you can find it, but not necessarily one I would buy again."
"Beautiful reddish hue. Thick creamy head. Enormous hoppy aroma. Followed by just what you'd expect, an enormous hoppy flavor. It's a hop monster, and delcious. No hint of any problems from the can."
"Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. Nice as well. Drinkability is too good. They really need to keep putting these in cans b/c I'd definately drink them up. Good stuff..."
"Yum. I love Dale's so I was thrilled that I could get some of these in Georgia. Aroma was very hoppy, as one would expect, but not as much of a resin aroma as a Ruination or Hercules. Nice frothy, light-brown head, with super lacing. Taste starts off hoppy, then goes malty, before finishing with an average hoppy taste. Carbonation was soft. There was a slight alcohol finish. All in all a good, but not great DIPA. More on the Big Hoopy Monster side of the style."
"The high ABV and rather jarring change of flavors (from hop to malt and back again) make this a brew for a specialoccasion. Enjoy Gordon if you can--on tap or in aluminum."
"Overall it's a fine (if somewhat mellow) DIPA. It's nicely balanced, but I would prefer a little more hops. It's similar to the Dale's, but I think Dale's has more bitterness and flavor. It's a tad pricy ($10 for 4), so I think Dale's is the much better value."
"Beer is goood. Happy big bold beering."
"Comments  This was one of dozens of beers that Kim busted out for her first annual Bavarian Bratwurst Beer Fest. What a treat!"
"Strongly recommended."
"750 ml corked and capped botttle. $13.49. This one was probably even better fresh."
"Pretty dark for an ipa. Pours to a murky dark brown color. Wtih an off-white head. The aroma is malty and caramely with a chocolatey smell as well. I get a bit of roastiness as well. The flavor is malty and buttery with a rich caramel, candy flavor. The hops are slightly spicy and fruit, but the malt is what sticks out most. Medium-full in body and very tasty. I nice beer."
"Reviewed from a 2003 750ml capped and corked bottle with no dates of any kind on it and a hefty price tag of 14 bucks. Wow this poured out very dark with a nearly opaque dark brown with red hues and it appeared black at times. The head was a tall beige one that had good retention and left sheets of lace around the glass through the session. The nose was of a bit of fruit with citric and floral hops jumping out at you. The flavor was great with caramel and chocolate standing out more than I would expect from a double ipa and citric hops still holding there own here. A very nice mix of flavors mingling here with an interesting caramel citric bitter finish to end it all. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a nice chewiness to it. This was one of the more interesting beers I have had in a while. The malt profile added greatly to this IPA was still maintaining the hoppiness expected from it. The 9.2% really made not sharp appearances even as this warmed. If not for the huge price of this I would enjoy this one much more frequently."
"A great double IPA. Huge thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sharing this one with me."
"Sampled from a corked 750ml bottle. When I poured this I had to double check the label to make sure it was an IPA...didn't expect it to be so dark. In the glass, it's a deep amber almost brown with a sticky white head. Rich & very sweet aroma of floral hops and candied passion fruit. Smooth bready malt start with evident warming alcohol and underlying dulled sweetness. Sticky hop resins & notes of pine. Moderately bitter and medium to thick in the mouth. Finishes with sugar coated raisins and spicy hops. A rather odd, but unique blend of flavors make this a brew that's certainly worth trying."
"Quite tasty actually. There is a medium-bodied fullness, which compliments both the hop and malt contributions. This is in the tradition of Arrogant Bastard Ale; massively hoppy but with a caramel sweet hint of toasted maltiness to boot. Goes down so smooth, this is an incredible brew, get some if you can."
"ng"
"WOW! This is the darkest, thickest, richest IPA, Ive ever consumed! The beer pours a porter brown to almost black with some ruby high lights, the head mountainous, the texture creamy, and the color a toothsome light brow, the lace is thick and glutinous. Nose is dominated by the hop floral aroma, with an almost cotton candy sweetness, start is ambrosial, rich in malt with the top thick and pleasant to the palate. Finish has a modest acidity, the hops enduring in their spiciness, and with a 9.2 ABV, quite a nice belly warmer, a magnificent beer."
"Pours very dark for an IPA. This looks more like a scotch ale or even a porter than an IPA. Very dark mahogony, yet still clear. Large cream head on top. Aroma is not incredibly strong, yet is somewhat complex. Apples jump out at first, along with some citrousy hops and a whiff of alcohol. Hard to detect much more. Taste is complex and lengthy.Apples and grapefruit & piney hop resins come out up front and last throughout the sip. A bitterness takes over big time. Behind all this is a decent malt character. Just enough to keep the taste factor up. Some caramel taste show up upon warming, all the while a alcohol bite pokes through. Mouthfeel is excellent and almost chewy, with flavors dancing around the tongue. Drinkablity is decent for a beer this potent. """Better than Dreadnaught"""? I think not, yet this is a bit different."
"Delicious! This is the darkest, thickest, and creamiest IPA I've encountered. Pours a beautiful dark brown with a thin white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing in its wake. An explosion of hops fills the air as the beer is poured, with lots of citrus and pine notes. Incredibly balanced, with lots of chewy malt complementing the heavy hops. Smooth, chewy, and delicious. If there was such a thing as an """Oatmeal IPA," this is what it would be. I can't wait to have another."
"A whopper of a brew from Colorado. A nice copper brown color with thick, creamy head. Lots of citrus and pine aroma escape the glass. This is a very full bodied brew with plenty of complex hop and malt flavors to ponder. It is balanced nicely, citrus hops and very chewy malt ( caramel,brown sugar, toasty,lightly nutty) the flavors go on and on here. I'm not sure if this is a regular beer of theirs or a special release but worth seeking out while in the mountains. It can easily supply you with enough nutrients for a stay above tree line."
