3.66,-7.6,3.75,3.25,3.75,4,3.75,"Deep amber in color with a murky appearance.  There's a good inch of densely packed beige head resting on top.  Heavy lacing is on my glass.  Aroma of citrus hops and cereal grains is prominent.  The flavor is a deep citrus burn comparable to an orange that is held in check by some light cereal grains.  On the fade you get a nice citrus hop burn.  The mouth is fairly thick,creamy, and a bit chalky.","Franziskaner","Sunday at 05:04 PM"

An exceptionally creamy palate with big citrus, traces of melon or perhaps guava, very light caramel and light grain notes finishes with a citrusy hop accent that segues into a quinine type bitter over lingering citrus flavors. A very creamy medium body with fine soft carbonation.","pat61","Nov 10, 2014"

That said, it also lacks some of that pungent juicy hop kick. It's a fine line to walk, and this one does it a bit more conservatively than most. However, that makes for an very drinkable brew that pairs well with a lot of different types of food.","LambicPentameter","Jul 15, 2014"

This hopped up beer is surprisingly balanced and the malt, hop and citrus flavors balance perfectly. Got get yourself one !!","hophugger","Jul 13, 2014"

The aroma is incredible, with definite citrus notes and some slight fruity/floral notes. The taste, thought, while not awful, doesn't live up to the aroma. There's not nearly as much hops in the taste as in the nose. It's just a little nondescript hops and mostly caramel malt. Not sure how that happened. The mouthfeel is silky with a nice bitter bite on the finish. This should be a great IPA but with the flavor so "meh" when compared to all its other components, it just falls short.","delta490","May 04, 2014"

Malt on the nose with very lite hoppy-ness, does not have the floral hoppy aroma that you would want or expect with an Imperial IPA. I have had the single wide and honestly prefer that to the double wide. Mouthfeel was flat and the finish leaves you with a poor aftertaste.

That being said, this is one of the better examples of the style I have tried. It has a lot of hops, but not to the point of killing off the other flavors. I found it to be fairly balanced, and a decent blend of the sweetness with the bitterness. Better than anticipated, but still not enough to make me a fan of the style.","Vixie","Feb 21, 2014"

4.49,13.4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I've been wanting to try this stuff, for a long time. Pours a deep clouded rusty amber hue with a billowing cloudy pillow of foam, rises well above the rims of the glass. Aroma I could sit and smell this beer all day, super citrus, apricots, spicy Belgian yeast has those Belgian Pale Ale notes a bit of funk tartness that works well with the hop additions. Pine takes a back seat to the more acidic citric notes, muted with Belgian yeast strains in the most beautiful way. A hint of band aid or medicinal quality is quickly brushed under the rug by tart apples, citric notes, and an explicit earthy quality that some call horse blanket or simply "funk" with an edge of apricot pit ground up on the palate. Citric notes, horse blanket earthy qualities again on the palate, bitter funky yeast notes in a nice double IPA. I'm happy overall, the carbonation and mouthfeel take this beer to another level with the Belgian inspiration the beer has, much with the rest of the Smokestack Series I have sampled thus far. This beer would pair great with a nice meal, pretty much anything I would go with braised pork ribs, or some ribeye with this beer in particular it's a beer that touches on the umami sensors on the palate already so any meats/cheeses would work well here.","WVbeergeek","Jan 24, 2014"

The hops dominated, but this didn’t shred your taste-buds or bore you either: it was like the average DIPA was captured and corked for our enjoyment.","CHickman","Jul 13, 2013"

Beer is well carbonated so it's light to medium bodied, sharp, crisp, even a little spicy, dry and crisp finish, mostly earthy citric hops and a more of a hoppy than grapey DIPA. Not too much sweetness, but there is a tad bit sweet and breadlike malt so there is a balance underpinning the mostly citric hops and there are a touch of sweet fruits, mind you. The ABV is subdued and this is a sipper that is one you can drink quick, although a little heavy, and not the most flavorful DIPA I've had but did not kill my taste buds and I thoroughly enjoyed it.","clayrock81","Jul 06, 2013"

Aroma of pine and citrus hops, light stone fruit and an unusual apricot fruit leather component that is intriguing. Flavor is dominated by sweet malt with citrus, somewhat dissipated herbal hops, hints of stone fruit. Finishes with a pleasant complex hop bitterness. Medium bodied. The hops are not as intensely forward as I hoped, but the hop flavor is relatively complex and interesting. A bit mellow for those spoiled by west coast hop bombs, but the malt / hop balance is nice and the flavors are complex enough to make a pleasant DIPA experience. Wish that dried apricot flavor was as dominant in the flavor as aroma, it is unusual and pleasant. I will return to this again.","LiquidAmber","Apr 11, 2013"

Poured an orangish-red, the color for the flesh of a ripe plum and filled with yeast sediment. The head was a sandy white, the color of an east-coast beach in the spring and fair to moderate lacing. The smell was fairly sweet like a peach or lavendar with good grassy hops. The taste was a little overly sweet, like sucrose. It was like fruit that was a little north of ripe. The hops had strong bittering, but much more low key for a DIIPA. Very full mouthfeel and fair carbonation. Not my favorite of the Smokestack Series which are usually very strong offerings. Definitely not a bad beer, but not the best of the DIIPAs that I love.","estlinska","Mar 15, 2013"

A fresh, fruity citrus hop aroma somewhere between orange and grapefruit dominates, but a touch of malty sweetness is also apparent. The flavor is less bright, and is instead driven more by a woodsy, piney blend of hop characteristics, but there is also a good dose of light caramel malts to balance. The medium body is lightened by a fine, active carbonation that may be even a bit too assertive. Overall, though, the rich, resinous, multi-faceted bitterness lingers comfortingly, making this beer an easy one to savor.","devilben02","Jan 24, 2013"

This brew poured a hazy tan color, produced a thick off white head, excellent retention and great lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of a very strong citric, piney hop aroma. Medium in body, a foundation of malted grain, fresh baked bread that is overtaken by a bitter citric, piney oily hop flavor. There are some slight suggestions of spicy white pepper, apple peel and pear juice. Overall, this is an excellent example of an Imperial IPA, a great session beer, lots of flavor but still bitter enough to please a hop head. If you are a hop head, you will not be disappointed with this offering. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 15, 2013"

Tropical fruits, citrus and cinnamon rolls greet the palate. The finish is dry and assertive, the malts and hops commingle as you swallow leaving you wanting for more. As a west coaster who enjoys the abundance of world class IPA/DIPA and their unique profiles I respect this brew as one that truly defines the regions resources to their fullest.

The smell was very strong from the open bottle, and intensified to mangoes (or peaches, which also smell similar), fresh cut hay, and pine resin upon smelling the glass. The taste was not as bitter as many others in the style, and gave this beer a woody, smoky, herbal character, which I believe comes mostly from the Chinook hops. Very clean and dry finish with apricot in the aftertaste. Very thick body, that feels like it could be chewed on. The sampler 4 pack of Boulevard Smokestack series has been full of winners so far. I am probably going to have to pick bombers of these beauties soon.","rajendra82","Dec 11, 2012"

This must have been bottle conditioned, as there are floaties suspended after a full pour. Malt is most prevalent with thick caramel and biscuit, hops have a grapefruit presence. Flavor is really caramelly with some wheat bread crust, bark and slight pine. Bitterness is nectary, flowery, and strong in the back of the tongue. Alcohol burn is noticeable, but not necessarily a flaw. Feel is slightly viscous, somewhat dry finish.  While this is solid, I'm just not used to such a malt prevalent double IPA. I'd really like some more earthy hops to go with the malt. I understand they aren't doing the whole West Coast hop thing, but I prefer hop forward IPAs. This is what a doucle IPA mist have tastes like in 1988. I'll try again, but my initial thought is that this isn't worth $12 for a four pack.","Philousa","Dec 10, 2012"

The scent is very hoppy, very inviting for an IPA. The texture is thin and smooth. The taste is crisp yet has hints of sweet toasted malts before it finish with a dry, bitter after taste.

The smell of this brew has a good hoppy aroma with a hefty amount of malt too. The taste of the beer gives off a nice malt profile in the beginning, soft and sweet, then unleashes the hops in the finish leaving behind resin like lemon flavors.

Very aromatic. Flavor follows with huge bitter, pine, some biscuity malt, very little sweetness. Medium carbonation and rather dry. The was a one dimensional beer that didn't really impress me.

On top was a thick, dirty tan head that started at about an inch and a half, dropped the inch, but the rest persisted throughout the drink, leaving a thick, scattered lacing as the beer level sank. I didn't think the nose matched the appearance. I picked up on some grassy notes, maybe some apricot, but to be honest it didn't jump out at me... The taste was back on target, with grass, pine, apricot and caramel malt rolling across the tongue to a significant astringency in the back of the throat, with heat from the alcohol. The mouthfeel of this beer is medium heavy from the malt, but hold it on your tongue and savor the bitterness. I'm a DIPA fan, and this one is good, really good.","bschinelli","Aug 18, 2012"

Lots of caramel malt notes with some mid range fruits behind it. I keep getting an apricot flavor with some citrus and pine hop notes behind it. The taste is more of the same. The bitterness is not harsh but has a nice soft roundness which comes off as tea like. Mouthfeel is good, easy drinking. Overall this was not a super dry pine hop bomb of a DIPA. Instead it was balanced, had some unique fruit hop flavors and the tea bitterness really rounded and integrated the beer for me. I will definitely pick this up again.","quirkzoo","Mar 01, 2012"

The taste however, is a straight up malt bomb. Granted, there's also a large hop presence, but it's extremely bitter, and still takes a back seat to the malt. The mouthfeel is extremely boozy. This is the opposite of smooth. The bitterness really lingers for quite some time. Overall, this is decent at best. I don't expect to revisit this anytime soon.","Retail1LO","Feb 18, 2012"

Like other Boulevards, this one's got floaties, but not too many. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light pine, light mint, light leek, and buttery caramel in the background. The taste is more malt-centric, with plenty of caramel coating the tongue throughout. The hops aren't gone, though, as grapefruit peel, orange rind, pine, very light leek, and light balsa weave their respective ways through the caramel cytoplasm (wow, some high school biology just found its way in there, eh?).

Poured a deep red-orange with a three finger cream colored head that subsided to one and a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, sweet alcohol, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, citrus hop, earth, and bitter hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The hops on mine were a little muted, but it was a little old by IPA standards when I got around to drinking it though. Still good though to be fair. I would love to try a fresher one as the malt by itself was a little abrasive and really needed some bitterness to help balance it out.

If that's what they were going for, they did it well. I assume not, and I was unable to have much more than a few ounces.

3.98,0.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Double Wide pours a burnt orange, lightening at the edges when backlit. The bone colored head is absolutely massive, 4 fingers of foam that comes as close to spilling over the top of the glass without actually doing so as possible. The head retention is decent, and leaves tightly grouped rings of lacing plastered to the inside of the glass. The nose is a little bit dull, which is a disappointment, but has a balance between caramel malty sweetness and citrus and slightly piney hoppiness that's right in my wheelhouse. It's not as absolutely bone dry as some other IPAs, but hops are definitely more in charge than in some more balanced, east coast versions of the style. The flavor follows suit, with a pronounced yet smooth bit of bitterness providing an intermission between malty and hoppy flavors. I was not surprised to find Centennial in the list of hops Boulevard used, as that distinct bitter grapefruit flavor I get (and am not crazy about) shines through. The body is pretty good, fairly middling and it lines up with the slight malt presence of the beer. The carbonation is surprisingly disappointing, given the voluminous head upon being poured. It falls a bit flat by mid sip and really doesn't help the hops truly shine. Boulevard's crafted a very good/enjoyable double IPA, but one that, to me, doesn't quite measure up to the best of the style.","axeman9182","Jun 09, 2011"

There's some hop notes in the nose but not much of anything else. As far as the taste . . . I don't really have the built up palette to know the difference between differen hops. That being said, I don't like the hops used in this. There's a sour flavor mixed in which I'm not sure if that's from the hops or yeast, but it's unpleasant for the style.

A hint of something medicinal. The thickish, fluffy feel also seems out of place.

There is a date on the bottle saying 09/2011, so I guess this is the "best by" date, so this may explain the oxidative flavors and aromas. I can appreciate a brewer that can take this style and make a drinkable beer out of it. So many in this category are just "hop monsters" with no real regard for drinkability...they just want to have 10,000 IBU's printed on the bottle or some such.

It was a good beer but the bitterness that is often overpowering in heavy IPAs was prevalent in this beer. It has a nice aroma with hints of spearmint and an almost cotton candy sweetness of the malt. It pours marvelously with a full thick head and a delightful hazy cinnamon color and thick lacing along the glass. The taste was the most disappointing factor for me as the hops tasted forced and not flowing like a really excellent IPA. The alchohol is not expertly hidden but it is still tasty enough to finish the whole bottle with a smile on your face. The 8.5% helps with this. I really didn't taste much of a difference as the beer warmed up yet I would still recommend this beer not be too cold. All said, being a native Coloradan, this is the best thing that has ever come out of Kansas. I'll have to try some more of their specialties.","vincicle","Oct 09, 2010"

Not completely overpowering but the primary flavor is definately grapefruit. Hunting a little further and you can taste the sweetness of the malt before turning to grapefruit.

Cloudy copperish red-orange, you can just see through it, your fingers are shadow puppets on the other side of the glass, lightens around the rims. The nose can jab you but isn't out to score points, the first sign that this is a beer content to just be an "American IPA" and not a wannabe DIPA. Scents of tangerine, lime, pink grapefruit mesh with pineapple, papaya, peach, apricot fruit, more floral than piney but in any case appears fresh and ruddy cheeked the first concern, vague dusting of cocoa powder, just hits you with the categorical basics with dignity and reserve. Medium-bodied, same demeanor as in the nose, maybe the carbonation adds a little too much fluff. Otherwise, very balanced with an emphasis on that tangelo, pink grapefruit citrus as well as pine and then caramel, butterscotch and honey. Never too sweet, just lively, there's a pleasing herbaceous nip to it. Calms down as it gets near the finish line with elevating carob, chocolate notes. Manages both a clean and lingering finish.

That is soon followed by a grass and pine fragrance, then ending with a hearty malty and bread scent. The malt is hearty on the palate, but it does not last very long. A hop onslaught occurs, bringing intense citric flavors of grapefruit, pineapple, and lemon. Other flavors like grass and earth show up, but they cannot overtake the citric flavors. A medium to slightly heavy body that stays consistent all the way through. The back of the palate is left with a medium dryness. A very strong offering to sip on, with the dark and enticing color, along with the intoxicating aroma, intense flavor and finishing with a pleasing feel, puts this beer in the hopheads delight category.","cameraman","Mar 02, 2010"

Smell isn't too strong, but I do get a fair amount of caramel and sweet malty backbone. A bit of citrus hops come in too. Taste is overpoweringly hoppy--big resinous, bitter, leafy hops give way to a nice display of some citrus hops... as it warms it's followed by a substantial malt backbone with some alcohol. Nice balance with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, somewhat creamy, although I was looking for a bit more smoothness... good stuff here for sure. The Smokestack Series is the real deal, IMO. Big ABV and hop character make this one a sipper, though a great beer.","LordAdmNelson","Nov 17, 2009"
4.09,3.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a tumbler after a five minute struggle with the cork (Why do they =ever= use corks?) it forms an impressive 2 inch tannish head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is a somewhat light amber and cloudy. The aroma is strongly of citrus hops. The taste is mainly the hops with moderate bitterness and nice malty sweetness.

The smell is likewise ominous, a strong malt presence not only balances the hops but threatens to take over. This smells sweet and barley-winish, I want more hops. The taste is more malty than I'd prefer or expect, just as the aroma promised. The hops are west coast citrus style but are just totally dominated by the malt sweetness. The body is thick which fits the rich flavors, but it doesn't suit me and it certainly hurts the drinkability.

Full flavored, the fruity citrus taste is balanced well with substantial sweetness. So tell me, is this a Double? Yeah, maybe. The sweetness and hop resin characteristics linger nicely on the palate.

4.02,1.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very hazy amber color. It clears a bit if you let it sit for a while, but the haze never really disappears. The head that forms is huge - really huge. But it's very loose, the bubbles start popping, then it looks a bit like miniature swiss cheese, then it starts to collapse, leaving only tiny bits of lacing down the glass. I really enjoy looking at this one, but the color is just a bit too dark for my tastes. When the head is still at its peak, there's a moderate note of tropical fruits, backed up with a nice floral smell - a bit of pollen and some resins, and as the head falls back, you get a nice malt presence - slightly toasty, a bit sweet, caramelly, a tiny bit crackery, but still nice and dry as far as I can tell. The hops come off a bit more pungent, slight overtones of barleywine, kind of toeing the line between IPA and Barleywine in the smell. The taste starts out with a very nice battle between the hop bitterness and some malty sweetness. The hops seem to win at first, coming off a bit fruity, almost peachy, as the malt and alcohol begin to win, slightly bready, but not too sweet, with a nice toasty almost crusty flavor, with a light alcohol burn. Then the hop profile opens up again, with plenty of floral notes, this may be one of the most floral beers I've ever had, really delectable I think - leafy, slightly herbal, it's as if the springtime was realized as a taste in your mouth, that's about as accurate as I can describe it. And it turns out much drier than it appears to be, but there's still a very nice malt complexity to the whole thing. Much less citrus than you expect, but I think it still comes across quite nicely. I really like the mouthfeel, quite a bit less full and chewy than I expected it to be, which is very nice in this case. Good carbonation, a slight tickle, not too powerful. The body is actually about medium, and it's enhanced nicely by hop resins. Overall, I found this to be quite enjoyable. It's quite a bit different, and you've got a bit to get over in terms of the difference between this and the average american type IPA. I'd go for it if I could have it again.","taylorhamrick","Jul 19, 2009"

Look at the ABV, and look at the name, and then consider that they've got another beer called Single Wide. Do the simple math, and most importantly, just taste this thing.

Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet hops up front, roasted malt, and then some sweet malt. A strong general bitterness.

Pours a deep copper color, with a ton of carbonization providing a huge 3 finger head, and foamy lacing as it slowly recedes. Impressive appearance that falls short in the aroma. I was expecting as strong hops punch, but couldn't find it. It was a very muted scent overall. I am surprised that the taste was this good given the weak smell. The taste is a strong hop bitterness up front followed by a sweet citrus aftertaste. The sweetness overtakes that hop dryness that some DIPAs provide in the aftertaste, which helps balance out the high carbonization that stings a bit in your mouth. In the end, a very tasty DIPA.","bhalter8","Feb 28, 2009"

Taste is not nearly as hoppy as I would have thought from the smell. Defiantly the usual suspects in there but lots of caramel, some astringency. Definitely sweet, but not overly so.

4.3,8.6,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"This one explodes out of the bottle with a hazy orange amber color with a hint of red. the head is massive and lingers as a cap forever leaving tons of lacing. The aroma is very balanced with big citrus hops smells up front with grapefruit and apricots. But the sweet caramel malt base comes through as well as a slight honey sweetness. The taste has a bit of hops up front with grapefruit, but nothing overpowering, followed by the bready malts and fruity sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and a slight bitterness in the finish. This is my first in the Smokestack series and I'm extremely impressed. This is a great IPA.","gford217","Sep 07, 2008"
3.8,-4,4,4,4,4,3,"Pours a gorgeous bronzeish,orange color with a nice off white frothy, pillow like head that really hangs out for a while. Smell is Hop glorious! Very subtle aromas of orange peel,grapefruit with a pleasant bready aroma. Taste is superb! citrus fruit extravaganza with a nice tangy hop bitterness. Malt is by no means overpowering but is matched well with the extreme hop profile. Mouthfeel is also superb leaving a nice creamy bitterness with a touch of alcohol at the end. Drinkibility seems to be ok for a DIPA with a 8.5%ABV. Overall a fantatic beer, and well worth seeking out, if you haven't tried it. Highly Recommended!","ABHatter","Sep 05, 2008"

Super piney aromas- almost medicinal in their intensity, like a nice gin. Sweet malt and some breadiness rounds it out. The taste is very nice as well, but it drops off a bit after an initial spicy, hoppy breadiness. There is a slight medicinal taste and some sweet breadiness at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than it could be, and it is just a tad grainy as well. Still, this is quite an enjoyable beer. Very nice.","Georgiabeer","Aug 23, 2008"

4.23,6.8,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a 750ml champagne bottle into a tulip glass. As I poured a little faster than normal, a huge head formed and I had to wait a few minutes for it to recede so I could pour a little more into the glass. The foam stuck around for quite a while and left behind some very nice lacing. Hazy amber in appearance. Very lovely to look at! Smell is of big-time piney hops. Not like other DIPAs out there, as this one is not so much on the citrus end of things. Some hints of caramel hit the nose, but it's hard to find amongst the huge hop aroma. Taste is much the same. It's all hops on this one, baby! Piney, a bit of citrus, grapefruit, a bit floral, good use of caramel malt, dry yeasty finish. Also, I strangely picked up a hint of coffee on the finish?? Hmmm... This thing was supercarbonated which made for plenty of enjoyable belches, yet it was somewhat syrupy and full-bodied. Alcohol could be felt, and gave a slight warming effect as the brew warmed up to room temperature. A very nice DIPA, and was very happy to find some of the Smokestack Series while in the Cities over the weekend.","KeefD","Aug 04, 2008"

Aroma consists of dominant citrus and floral hops with a distinctive touch of grapefruit all of which constitute a near perfect aroma. Taste is a mix between some citrus and grapefruit hops with a light floral malt backbone. Bitterness is not a dominant element and I somewhat enjoy the fact that a IIPA can be something else that a bitter bomb. Average body with good carbonation and no discernable alcohol. I really enjoyed the presence of grapefruit notes and the attenuation of the bitterness. This beer really makes me want to further discover the beer form this fine brewery.","Phyl21ca","Jun 24, 2008"

A ton of pine aroma in the nose, almost completely dominates the smell. Taste delivers on the pine, with a decent amount of sweet/caramel malt taste to equal things out, a touch of grapefruit bitterness in there, too. There's a bit of a raggedness to the edges of this beer, kind of rough on the palate...some nice spiciness on the tongue, though.

Not that those are necessarily bad, but this is more like smelling pine-sol. Some grassy notes as well on the nose. The flavor doesn't pick up the slack for the nose. Very average as well. Too grassy. Too piney. And a little too harsh for my liking. There's a lingering harshness that is not like your typical lingering bitterness in well crafted DIPA. This is more astringent than bitter. More solvent like than resiny or pungent. I've had lots better. This is merely average.","Bighuge","Jun 12, 2008"

It is almost the color of tea. It doesn't have a strong nose, but what is present has hints of citrus and grain. For as thick as the head is, there isn't much carbonation on the tongue.

A seriously anticipated brew from some regional favorites that should give me my fix. Pours a flat copper with a ton of fluffy, rolling tan head off a very light pour. The head recedes at a snails pace and leaves a chunky lacing here and there. Smells of sweet citruses and sugary grapefruit with a fruity sourness as an afterthough and a striking hoppiness enveloping it all very nicely. Taste is uniquely thick and sweet up front with the bitterness and citrusy goodness following things up quickly, making for a different, yet very substantial and palate pleasing experience. Some chalkiness lingers around afterwards. This brew is big on the carbonation, has a medium mouth presence, and goes down fairly smooth.

Spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is pretty good. Some pine and grapefruit with a spicy presence. Flowers, fresh grass, pretty earthy. Light sweetness. Taste is spicy up front. Pine and grapefruit rind to follow. Quite the earthy taste. The pine is almost like pine needles straight from a tree. A hint of caramel sweetness but a bitter, drying finish with some biscuity, breadiness to it. Mouthfeel has a good bitterness level. It isn't thick at all and very effortless and smooth. Great persistent carbonation and tingle with dryness on the tongue. Lots of assertive bitterness and very unique flavors. Almost too easy going down.

Drying, bitter and nicely fruity all at the same time, with peaches, mango, apricot and some grapefruit rind coming to mind. Wow, this is unique, flavorful, and very fruity without being syrupy or cloying in the least. Crisp bubbly mouthfeel, but slightly thick body too. This is perhaps my favorite DIPA.

4.77,20.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"there has been some discussion on the board as to which style this falls under. It kind of sits on the fence between an American IPA and a DIPA. Either way, this is delicious.","bort11","Nov 19, 2007"

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer has a nice balance of bitterness and malt. It is not a hit you over the head with hops brew. Very easy drinking for the alcohol level.","homebrewhawk","Nov 17, 2007"
4.35,9.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is an excellent new IPA from Boulevard, It's not going to burn your tongue off - with only 55 IBUs, it's barely an IPA - but the taste and aroma off this beer both have enough complexity to keep you interested and the balance of the beer preserves your taste buds so you can enjoy the whole 750ml, although the 8.5% will sneak up on you.","SafeAtFirst","Nov 16, 2007"
