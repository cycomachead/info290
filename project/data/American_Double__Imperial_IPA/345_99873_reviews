review_text
"Poured into a tulip glass, this beer had a nice thick white head and a mango orange color. There where copious amounts of floaties probably from the whole cone hop additions, and quite a bit of haze. It smelled of citrus, earth, and hops. It had a full mouthfeel with citrus bitter, earth and grass notes. Nice dry piney aftertaste."

""

"Liked the pour; nice but short lived head. Enjoyed the woodsy smell but expected/wanted more hops. Felt a bit watery for a double. Would buy again if at a better price."
"Looks and smells great. Taste is a little too bitter and unbalanced. Solid tho"

"Mild hop, but great taste"
"This is my first beer from Victory and I can't wait to try more from their lineup!"

"An extremely well done, often overlooked IIPA. Exceptional value as well."

"What SHE said, """I find it very acidic. Just.. weird taste at the back of your throat... bitter. Smells better than it tastes.""" 3.5/5"

"Wonderful Example of DIPA. The Perfect balance between the malt sweetnes and hop bitterness is fantastic. A lot of grapefruit, mango, papaya, and pineapple in the taste, with dry finish and citrus notes at the and. Thin texiture, medium body, soft carbonation."

"Overall: My go-to dIPA. I'm very thankful that its so available where I am and am blessed to have a beer this good on hand. It is a bit pricey so it is a treat, but absolutely always in my fridge in some amount. If you haven't had it, you have to."
"Beautiful beer, but get it on tap. The difference is pointed."
"Excellent! Wish I ran into this little gem more often."
""
"Id call this an exceptional DIPA. My only complaint is that it only comes in a four pack."
"Overall - Wow this is a kickass DIPA! Honestly, not my favorite style as I prefer single IPAs, but this is just spot on in all the right places - doesn't feel too boozy or cloyingly sweet, really tasty hop profile. Awesome beer."
""
""
"Very close the Pliny de elder! Very delicious beer.  Had it at strangers, el Centro ca.  Definitely try it again!"
""
""
"Smooth beer for the amount of alcohol, but a bit too sweet for my taste; also a bit too carbonated. It was very good, but there are a lot better double IPAs out there."
"Very sweet, not skunky, appears unfiltered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Overall a great beer."
"Enjoy by February 2, so a bit late to enjoying this. Still has a great hop aroma and citrus taste. Crystal clear. Poured in a Spiegelau IPA glass. I bet it tastes great fresh, because it was very good """expired"""."

"Bottle, best by date july 4, 2015. Not bad beer. Just didn't blow me away. Lemony taste. Real smooth. Alcohol hidden. I wanted to try this for awhile. Maybe I hyped it up too much."
""
""
""
"A very good IPA. I prefer this one from the bottle."
""

"Got a lot of dank hop flavor. Love this beer in small quantities, could have it once a month but not an every week type of beer for me."

"Because perfection is hard to come by, I  have to go with a 4.75 overall.....but as I wait for the perfect beer, this is as close as it gets for me. Best tasting IPA out there and I've tasted many. Out of 7 billion ppl in the world and each having an opinion, mine is this is the best IPA out there!"
"Great smelling beer- just a little danky on the aftertaste and a tad boozy."
"This has to be one of the best buys out there for what it compares to. Taste tested up against Lawson's Double- Sunshine and difference was minimal. Would rate higher... but for some reason... this one imperial seems to give me heartburn... each time I have had it. Maybe something unique in the ingredients... but overall... a wicked good beer."
"Nice, citrusy flavor. Balanced hop taste as well. Don't taste any of the alcohol, and I would definitely get this again."
"on par with Pliny the Elder"
"Thoughts- I've had this many times over the past few years and it never ceases to amaze me. I have had some fluctuations in clarity and sometimes in taste, but still overall one of the finest beers I've ever had."
"Pours a golden yellow, almost orange with a white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of pine from the hops, was hard to detect anything else. The taste was great with bright hops and lemon peel coming through first and then giving way to the sweetness of the malt for a very clean finish. Mine was a little over-carbonated but I still thought it was exceptionally solid."
"Great pronounced hop flavors but not overly so, overall a great beer"

"Great hoppy brew with lots of flavor."

"Great beer. Excellent after taste...slight citrus. Will be buying alot more"

"Not a bad double, a bit citrusy for my taste, but not bad. The smell is nothing like the taste."
""
""
"WOW! Having tried some of the highest rated DIPA's, I'm not sure in a blind taste test which I would pick for my favorite - lucky to be in Victory's distro area and realize I can buy this beer anytime, anywhere. This beer is truly excellent on all counts."

"I shan't bore you with a thousand word essay...  This is a very good IIPA that is fairly easy to find. That may sound like an easy thing, but it's not. It borders on a top tier IIPA to me, but is it really?  Everything is there but it's not quite up to the level of a fine handcrafted, dare I say, Vermont. top level IIPA. But with all things considered it is indeed a very good beer which is pushed up the beer meter even more because of its availability.... If you can't drink it, you can't taste it. In that regard, my friends, this good stuff."
""
"12oz bottle poured into shaker. Appearance is clear light golden with off-white head that’s really sticky. Aroma is grapefruit, floral hops, grassy hops, light malts, and tropical fruit. Taste is initially sweet with honey and caramel then moderate grapefruit peel and herbal bitterness. Light to medium body, some stickiness in the texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"So what do we have in the final conclusion? Drinkablility. It cannot be argued, this is a Lorelei of a beer, a """siren sweetly singing"""; and she needs to be appreciated for her beauty, but recognized for her stealth and potential. Possibly the best double IPA on earth!"
""
"Fantastic!! Delicious hoppy hit with grapefruit and citrus notes and finishes so nice and clean. If you're looking at a line of taps and see this one, take it."

"Huele y sabe resinosa de hop. Puedo sentir la mezcla del citra con el mosaic"

"Strong pour yields about a finger’s worth of cream white foam, more or less even surface, a few larger bubbles, has good retention of what’s there, the lacing is more like a thin, consistent webbing than thicker streaks. Coppery colored liquid, neither shiny nor dull, somewhat translucent as well, very few visible bubbles. The nose has a good amount going on, lots of pine and grapefruit, tangerine citrus, peppery, leafy without seeming green, the fruit is tropical pineapple, nectarine, mango with apricot, more edgy than wet and juicy, for the punch it packs it also possesses a sinewy, punctuated dissolve. Full-bodied, sappy and heavy in mouth feel. here too leans on the pine, citrus and herbal matter for the cornerstone of flavor. Not that floral but has a patina of malt sweetness and brioche style breadiness. Mango, papaya, pineapple, nectarine, apricot fruit bright and succinct at once. A touch boozy but no heat in the throat. The stickiness prevents it from being a thirst slaker but that is clearly not the intent. Big, bold and proud of it."
""
""
"Edit: After finishing off the 4 pack, I found that this beer has a much bolder, hoppier taste straight from the bottle vs poured into a glass. In the glass, it has a slightly refined, more toned down intensity. Good either way. I think I prefer it in a glass."
""
"Very nice full body IPA.  Like"

"Paired with burger. Deliciously hoppy."

"Bitter citrus hops explode on the palate with grass and metallic carbonation even enhancing its crisp impression, while ample bready, slightly toffeeish malts carefully balance the brew. The hop complexity is suberb, great interplay between tropical, refreshing orange and papaya, with an enjoyable herbal support, while sour citrus and onion sting the palate, leading to piney, wooden malt notes. Long, sticky citrus finish with an unexpected piney quality shining through."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very well crafted Double IPA that brings a ton of American citrus hops to the party. The entire focus and balance of the beer is out towards showcasing the hops."
""
"Ok. Not great, just ok."
"Floral and citrus aromas leap from the glass and hopefully portend good things to come.  Has a pallid, yellow-orange body with a handful of off-white froth.  Taste is bold and bright with striking notes of orange and lemon zest followed by citrus peel, a touch of vanilla, some grain and tannins.  Lighter than expected body and the alcohol hides behind a curtain pure fruit juice.  Must rank this one up there with the best of the style."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours golden with tall, fluffy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy, orange marmalade and bready malt.  Body is medium and crisp.  Citrusy, herbal hops dominate the flavor while bready malt and tropical fruit provide support.  Finish is long and dry from alcohol.  Dangerously drinkable brew."

"Pretty good. Decent flavor, after bite a bit harsh - it is a double IPA."
"Poring out Dirtwolf for the first time it looks slightly hazy, light straw colored with a  frothy two finger white head.  Putting it up to my nose it has a dankness, citrus, lemon, and a slight sweetness (could be slightly stronger but still very appealing).   Taste follows the nose with more complexity and starts citrusy, lemony, has a pepper note, salty, dry in the back end with a slight bready tone, then a bitterness that lingers.  Carbonation is perfect for this beer and the mouth feel is medium to full, as the beer goes down it has a slickness to it.  Probably the double IPA that victory has made.  One of the best beers produced by them so if you like big bold IPA's this one is one to look out for, Cheers!"
"Great Double IPA. Nice light caramel color. Beautiful nose, floral as fruity. Initially sweet smooth taste with a grapefruit finish with just the right amount of bitterness. Top notch DIPA."
""
"A variety of tastes after you sip one is amazing. Very filling."
"Nicely integrated finish. Helluva beer."

"O: Another great on from Victory."
""
"Excellent beer, great taste & body"

"Pale yellow, thin head. The aroma reflects the piney hops, almost a cat-pee smell, prolly from the Citra. Great juicy taste, no caramel but lotsa malt backbone. Grapefruit and citrus hop taste, lingers on yer tongue. Very enjoyable, zipped through my pint pretty darned quickly..."
"This might be my favorite beer from Victory.  Nice balance of hops and malts.  Highly recommend this beer."

"smells like wolf pee, in the dirt"
""
""
""
""
"O-  A top notch Double IPA!  This was my first Victory product and it lived up to the hype.  I need to try more."

"Drink fresh. Clean and delicious double."

"Drink 5 and your good to go"
"This dirty wolf is fresh and clean.  It sings more than it howls with the perfect amount of bite.  Not sure what all that shit means but this is a fine beer."

"Bough this today as suggested from another site. Upon opening the hop nose is pretty intense/nice. I was trying to compare it in my mind to the V Hop Ranch. I believe at the moment that the hop flavor of the Hop Ranch is more intense which I like. Will need to revisit the Hop Ranch to be certain. Pretty solid overall."
"Honestly would be hard pressed in my opinion to find a better double IPA.  Fantastic hop kick and very smooth.  I go through cases of this since it is easily available here in Philly area."
""
"This is one of my favorite beers! Big bold and tastes delicious!"
""
""
""
"Overall: very good brew, cant wait to try some more like it"
""
""
""
""
"Great dry, bright, citrusy DIPA. Readily available in the NE and outstanding for the price. Easily compares to the hard to obtain legends in this category and has become a go-to. A must try for enthusiasts of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not an IPA guy or a hop head, but this beer balances somewhat aggressive hops and malt sweetness to become a truly delicious IPA. I really like this one and wish I lived within distribution range still."
"Great double IPA, which has been my preference as of late. I had one last night that tasted great but had a lot of yeast in the bottle even after I poured it into glass. Had not had that happen with dirtwolf in the past. Looked a bit unappealing but did not affect taste. Great beer"

"O: Easily one of my favorite DIPA's. Earthy, fruity and easy to drink. Almost didn't notice the high abv."

"Definitely the best double IPA I have had. Great hoppiness, very possible my favorite beer"
""
"This is a beer that is not regularly available to me and would gladly go out of my way to drink again.  No problem saying this is a top 10 beer that I have had in a 12oz bottle."
"I do not like this style at all but, If I did I imagine this could be one of my favorites. Crisp, Dry, Citrus, Pine, Pine , Pine  and oh yeah, lots and lots of bitter."
"One of the top 5 best double IPAs I've tried.  The abv is hidden well and if you like bright, grapefruity and piney IPAs, definitely give this one a shot."
"Nice and bright, very citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Even with a relatively careful pour, the lively brew overflows the IPA glass with steady, slow rising carbonation. The end result is a staggering whipped cream-like head that mounds over the top of the glass, adorning a golden honey colored ale. It's a little lighter than I expected, and the color and clarity afford a great view of the myriad particulates that are suspended in the liquid. After a good while, there is still ample foam retained, and lovely lacing on the glass.  This one looks like it belongs in a commercial. The aroma is incredible. Dank, earthy and aromatic. Very bright and floral. A bit of pineapple and tropical fruit flair. Absolutely luscious! The first sip is an explosion of complex hop character. Tart earthy spice, minty pine and citrus zest. Artfully balanced with just enough malt sweetness to play along, without becoming cloying. The alcohol is well hidden, so despite a cumulative booziness on the breath, it's undetectable. The mouthfeel is juicy. Exceptionally fresh and lively. This is hands down one of the best double IPA's I've ever had. Nothing is to excess, but it is brimming with complexity and character. I would be happy just smelling this beer. Fortunately, the look, taste and feel are up to the challenge too. This is a marquee example of an American IPA and what passionate brewing can produce."

"Way too much grapefruit notes.  Overpowered everything else."

"Glass- Tulip"
""
"Enjoy by 24th of April, 2015.  Poured from the bottle into a tulip at about 55 degrees.  Pour is very hazy light orange in color with a thick foamy white head that fades to a thin film with little lacing within minutes.  Smell is sweet citrus fruit and candy corn.  Taste is grapefruit, lots of grapefruit and sweet malt flavor that blends very well with a pleasant hop bitterness that lingers a while on the palette.  Mouth feel is medium heavy with medium carbonation and very little alcohol presence.  Overall this stuff is top notch and easily takes a spot in my top 5 in terms of DIPA."
""
""
"Good beer! Needs more carbonation. I would pair it with something a little more on the sweeter side for a main course like pork tenderloin and apple sauce or honey glazed salmon. I give it a 91/100."
"Not much of a head. Pours hazy with heavy sediment. Overall very good beer"
""
"Good beer. Full, tasty, not pungent. Easy to go down and with an 8.7 ABV it can get you really quick!"

"Amazing DIPA with beautiful lacing, amazing hop aroma that perfectly (and expertly) enhances/blends with the flavor.  Best of all, cost is surprisingly low for such an amazing beer!"
""

"O: This beer is fantastic it's fruity spicy and you want to just keep drinking one after another."
"Smells good. Extremely hoppy and sweet initial taste. Slightly malty. Very drinkable. It's like a sweeter idiot ipa"

"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Cloudy  straw color with heavy suspended sediment.  Nice two finger head with reasonable retention and nice lacing. Not heavily carbonated.  Sweet earthy hop aroma which prepares you perfectly for the flavor.  A nice balance though a bit on the malty sweet side.  The hops are pronounced but not overly bittering.  Overall, this is a great DIPA and another excellent offering from Victory."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark golden color with a nice two finger head, good retention and lacing. Outstanding aroma, with citrus, pineapple, mango, slight resin notes and a bit of bready sweetness from the malt. The flavor is identical to the smell, with pineapple and tropical fruit dominance and just a hint of a nice malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied a nd silky smooth. Overall, this is one of my favorite IIPA's, simply outstanding, I can't wait for it to be released each year, well worth waiting for."
""
""
""

"this beer pours a hazy light copper. Not much of a head. Wonderful Apple smell malts and citrus. Taste is rather disappointing.not really what I would've expected from a double IPA. Mouth feel is pretty good. Bitterness at the back of the tongue which is my preference on an IPA."

"12 oz bottle.  Dusky straw gold, a light touch of particulate suspension creates a hint of cloudiness. Clean white head is prominent and quite willing to stay for the party. Some decent lace on the glass. The nose is big and fragrant with lots pineapple and other tropical fruits, citrus. There are peppery notes of spice and alcohol heat. A bit of a lemon honey malt undercurrent. Taste is superbly balanced for such a strong brew. The light pils type body and mild honey sweetness are quickly engulfed in the blanket of hop melange. The tropical qualities really stand out at first and the body develops and unfolds into a piney progression that blossoms in a grapefruit skinned finish, with a light minty flourish that opens up the well concealed alcohol as a vaporous fusel cooling of the tongue. Feel way to light and supple for a DIPA. Smooth, lightly creamy carbonation. Quenching and refreshing feel puts you in trouble when it comes to staying sober. It just goes down like as a session ale. This is a great all around DIPA and while not Pliney it is a great, easy drinking take on the stye. Love it."

"Pours a golden orange like color with a thin head that becomes a creamy white lace that clings to the side of the glass. Lovely oily hop aroma with a citric orange or grapefruit like smell. Initial taste is a strong balance of malty, spicy, and citrus fruit which is overpowered by a grassy and strong dry and bitter hop finish. Not such strong carbonation but the feel is a pleasant and creamy. If you like hoppy aroma and taste, this is definitely the beer for you. I have thus far enjoyed all of victory brewing companies products, and this is no exception."
""
"Sweet, no aftertaste or a tiny bit dry. No stupid afterflavors like berry, chocolate, pepper, etc.  Less hoppy than most IPA s at this ABV. SOLID. Your less beer-knowledgable friends will like it AND SO WILL YOU."
""
""
""
"Great hop character with lots of stone fruit, esp. peaches + prunes."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a fairly decent double IPA.  It has bite where it counts, but doesn't consume your taste buds either.  I definitely ask for it when I'm at the bar.  On tap, it's a must try."

"A nice West Coast flair to this beer.   Mostly clean, copper color with a mouth feel very similar to a Coronado.......soft and light.  I was surprised by this beer, very drinkable and has nice balance; much more so than some of the more popular West Coast favorites like Stone and Green Flash.    Trust me , I love those too, especially Ruination but this is an everyday IPA that is super-solid.  Impressed."

"From bottles expiring 09 March 2015: Intense pine and moderate grapefruit aroma.  Tastes of strong hops with pine, citrus, and flowery notes nicely complemented by somewhat sweet, bready malt; some spiciness that starts fading mid-palate.  Long moderately drying finish with grapefruit pith and flowers, and moderate hop bitterness and lingering sweet-saltiness on tongue; some nasal alcohol fumes.  Reminiscent of Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum—but with more citrus and flower here—and Bell's Hopslam—but sweeter here—if I recall correctly.  I seem to be drawn to brews with grapefruity esters.  An excellent American DIPA, with a subtle Arcimbaldo-esque figure on the label representing its rather silly name.  —Reviewed 27 October 2014"

"Pours light golden hue with two finger white creamy head and lacing everywhere,smell is pineapple, honeymelon, boiled candy and sherbet,feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are very balanced which I really dig with pineapple and honeymelon on the forefront followed by some candy and finished with a guava bitterness, overall a great example of what balance and restraint can do for a beer wish I bought more."

"Clear gold with visible carbonation.   Medium sized head with great lacing on the surface and on the glass.  Crazy good citrusy grapefruity brewed-inside-of-a-pine-tree hops smell.  Big sweet light malt carmelly backbone supports huge citrusy hops taste.  Like the best of the DIPA's it actually ends up tasting pretty balanced.  Heavy and boozy feel, which is really fine given the style.  Pretty great Imperial IPA."

"After reading the reviews this popped right into my wants. Then on a lowly day when beer shopping my phone died, unable to turn to BA for advice. With no particular wants in mind I picked this up, read the description on the side and knew I had to try it. This ended up as a want twice and for good reason. Smells and tastes primarily of citrus, mostly grabbing grapefruit and apple, surprisingly brings a brisk spice aspect once the pine comes forward. Aftertaste is dry and suitable to taste. Mouthfeel is crisp with biting carbonation. So easy and pleasurable to drink, my new personal go-to."
""
""
""
"O: Decent enough, but nothing to write home about.  I'm not sure the cask did this any favors.  (3.75)"
"Delicious DIPA, that is big, but dangerously easy to drink. Superb zesty citrus flavours, and has the required sweetness to counterbalance the layers of hops. Piney, bitter, perfect dry finish, wonderful balance, an absolute gem all round."

"Overall? Awesome. Can't tell if it's a double Belgian-style IPA? (I only say that because of the color and appearance...otherwise no hint of Belgian yeast). Methinks they realized Racer 5 set the bar for an unfiltered IPA and tried to match or exceed it. I say we keep the wars going, because this is pretty great..."

"Overall, this is an outstanding double IPA. If you enjoy IPAs, this is going to be an excellent beer for you to get your hands on. This beer really stands out over many others in its class. One of the better year-found DIPAs I've had."

"Shocking to think this is 8.7 as it certainly doesn't taste that strong but is incredibly smooth for a double IPA."
"original review 9-27-13"
"Definitely one of the better DIPAs I have had. It has a lot going on with its flavor including grapefruit, mango and peach all tied together with a fresh and earthy hop flavor. With bright and juicy flavors up front and finishing with a slight minerality, this beer is balanced wonderfully and feels wild and untamed. I love it!"
""
"Big malts ate up the bitterness and hop aroma and presence but overall a really nice example of the style.  Appearance was great and head and carbonation in the bottle were good as well.  Would like to try a draft since bottles are my least favorite delivery.  Had a punch for a 8.7 ale."

"The beer pours a hazy gold with specks of hops floating in the glass.  There is a good amount of carbonation bubbles racing to the top. The aroma is full of sweet citrus with a faint earthy characteristic.  There is an assertive hop flavor and bitterness right up front, yet the hop flavor and bitterness are perfectly balanced. Flavor is predominately citrus—like chewing on a grapefruit/orange rind. There is little malt taste present, but I don’t think this beer really needs a malt balance. The mouthfeel is very crisp, with a dry finish.  A truly exceptional DIPA."

"One of my top 3 beers this summer.  Excellent price for this one.  Craft brews can get expensive, but if you find this one, it's one of the best 12 oz. bottles for under $2."

"Very nice surprise. Had off Tap in Brattleboro VT in a tulip glass. Very pleasant with a nice kick. Nice smell. Very clean taste. Appearance is very clear with lite carbonation. Highly recommend."

"Overall- One of my favorite DIPA's, still doesn't measure up to Hopslam or Scream, but still in my top 5, mostly because the mosaic hops."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of citrus hops with some bitter notes also clearly noticeable. Taste is dominated by huge citrus and grapefruit notes with some floral undertones and some bitterness. Malt presence is hard to distinguish under the huge amount of hops used in this beer. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very good but a little bit too strong on the bitterness in my opinion."

"Pour is clear amber yellow with a tight full off white head.  Nose has clean fresh grain with strong citrus and grapefruit hops.  Brightly subtle and balanced.  Taste is similar, strong grain bill, fresh and deep.  Assertive clean hop, citrus and grapefruit.  Light bitterness in the finish with a lighter body, clean feel, moderate carb and dry finish."
""
""
"Poured a hazy yellow with a small head. The smell is tons of fresh hops. The taste follows the smell with plenty of hop character! Both earthy and floral a bit of bitter. A great DIPA full of flavor."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste / Palate: This one is all about the dank earthy hops with a good solid malty backbone. The flavor matches the aroma and brings a full smooth palate full of tasty hops and malt to the tongue. As I sip on and it warms a bit I get some tropical fruity notes as well. The finish is well balanced and the drinkability is crazy for a big Double IPA."

"Had this one to finish off an evening watching some TV on the DVR. Poured out a deep amber color with a slight hint of orange. The aroma is very hop dominated; particularly citrus. The taste is the same - strong citrus hop note but very well balanced by the rich malt backbone. The slightly bitter finish is so good that you almost don't want to lose it with another sip! The carbonation level is superb and the mouth feel quite rich. This is overall a top tier IPA that is perfect for enjoying slowly as you unwind from a tough day."

"Pours a mostly clear amber body with a small white head with good retention. Aromas are very big on orange zest, tropical notes, and spiciness (lots of zing), and caramel malt underbelly. Hops up front present as a citrus peel medley with a touch of resinous notes. The mid-palate is a soiree of sweet malts and spicy flavors, before a pleasant orange peel finish. Aggressive but well balanced. This is quite good, and I'd happily buy more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden in color with a bit of haze and a billowy off-white head. The nose is big and beautiful with lots of citrus and tropical fruits, really juicy with some nice dankness. The taste is just like the nose with some some great bitterness balance off all that sweet fruitiness. The beer is full and round in the mouth without being heavy. This is a great IPA, big hop presence in great balance with the rest of the beer."

"I bought a case of DirtWolf almost as soon as it hit the shelves. And it did not disappoint. I would only warn that the beer is so well crafted that the higher Imperial ABV is masked completely (unlike some other Imperial styles) . So, tread lightly! It's not called DirtWolf without reason!"

"Was really excited to try this one after being disappointed by the Hop Ranch. Unfortunately I didn't find this one much better. Tasted and smelled a little too much like an sweaty gym sock. I don't get the hype, but different people have different tastes, especially for IPA's. I must just be more of a West Coast IPA guy."

"O: 4 A really nice DIPA but nothing super special. There are a few ways it could improve (like being a bit more balanced), but it’s still nice for what it is. It’s also fairly different from some of the other popular DIPAs, which is kind of refreshing."

"super clear deep golden color, mild head dies down to a sticky bit around the edger. spotty but decent lacing. i am really surprised by how absolutely clear this is. not much in the nose, bit of hops, hint of grass. taste is mild for the style, good but could have more punch. hops are adding bitterness, but in a very pleasant way, touch of lemon is there. mouthfeel is smooth, touch of oil. wet. this feels as wet and it is clear. methinks a bottle would have a tad bit more presence than a growler."

"This to me is the perfect Double IPA.  It pours a great golden color with a creamy white head.  The smell is of beautiful hops and much of them.  The taste is hoppy, citrusy, piney, earthy, and smooth.  The mouthfeel is sticky and leaves you wanting more.  This is about as good as it gets for me.  Victory nailed it with this one!  I love this and would recommend it to anyone!"
""
""
"Wow very impressive. Pours great and just golden orange color with off white head. Great taste but not overwhelming but has that crisp IPA bite. Huge citrusy blast upfront but perfect malt balance at the end. Very well balanced. I would recommend this to anyone."
""
"Overall - This is darned near a perfect DIPA. These are the flavors I enjoy most in this style, bright citrus and tropical notes, a natural sweetness that is held perfectly in check by the hops, a wonderful transition to citrus pith and then finishing with the natural bitter dryness of stone fruit pits, leaving traces of the citrus and tropical flavors between sips. Victory has hit a home run here, right out of the park. A Must Try."

"This was a great beer that I would love to try again. Lots of hop aromas and great flavour. Mouthfeel was also really nice. Could have done without fewer floaties in my glass, perhaps I poured it too quickly? Awesome beer by Victory nonetheless and dangerously easy drinking at almost 9%."

"The beer pours some light, white, creamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a hazy orange with some brown notes. Lots of lacing on the glass. The beer has some very strong hop notes. The notes consist of orange and an earthy smell with a bit of tarty apple. The earthy smell is a bit strong and curls the nose a little bit but is certainly bearable and gives the beer a fairly unique aroma that isn't found in other hops. No real malt backbone to detect. The beer taste is somewhat similar to the smell. The taste has the orange notes and earthy taste from the smell but the orange/grapefruit notes are stronger than the pungent taste. The flavor reminds me a little of an orange creamsicle. There also appears to be a slight malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. The feel is creamy. Overall, a fairly unique DIPA and worth getting at least once."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a hazy medium to dark golden amber with a fine two finger slightly off-white head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with hints of pine, apple family and light tropical fruit. Flavor very nicely integrated pale malt supporting flavorful citrus, piney and slightly dank hops, very herbal and fresh tasting with a lingering citrus rind, piney and herbal hop bitterness. Medium bodied with pleasant light creaminess. Not as intensely hop bitter as the aroma suggests, but the depth of flavor is remarkable. Little flavor from the malt, but it adds body and a supports the fruit and hop flavors very well. Probably a not absolutley fresh bottle, having travelled across country and into Washington's Byzantine distribution system, but still top notch. I will make this a top priority next time I'm in the east to drink fresh. Excellent hop flavored IPA."

"Had this beer on tap at Victory before it was named Dirt Wolf. I really liked it then and still enjoy this brew very much. It has intense hop flavors of orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Nicely balanced bitterness, hop flavor, hop aroma and alcohol. I really like this beer."

"Pours a lovely orange marmalade with blonde highlights, a thick white head stick to the sides of my tulip. Dank citrus hops and soft piney resins are readily apparent on the nose. The body flows easily across the palate, orangey sweet malt, closing with a blast of hop bitterness. It goes down smooth and the lingering notes of evergreen pineapple leave me craving more. The ABV is dangerously understated. This one is not to be missed."

"Mouthfeel is the best part. Full hard medium with a nice long lasting/lingering finish. Starts sweet but then nice and bitter but not too gritty leading to a slightly juicy but more of a dry bitter finish. Not too much of a bite from the alcohol or the carbonation. Well balanced and touches all taste buds. Nothing not to like here, very drinkable. Nice beer, Victory did a great job."

"Vivid orange in color, not clear but far from murky. Nice 2 finger head settles to a cap of foam kept in tact by steady streams of carbonation. Lace is spotty but present. Smell is amazing. Big nose of peach and mango dance out and are followed by a tangerine sweet citrus note. Taste follows starting tropical with more mango than peach. Tangerine fight there way in mid palate and are met with an earthy and herbal edge that's very welcomed. A hoppy, citrusy and slightly piney finish make you forget how sweet it started. Initially very healthy carbonated and lively mouthfeel is refreshing. It smooths out a bit over time, taking on a creamier feel with a body that never surpasses medium. It's amazing what they've done here. A legit DIPA that drinks like one of the top in the class and can be had anytime. Great job!"

"O- Being a fan of Hop Wallop, I was a bit incredulous with its retiring in favor of a new DIPA recipe. However, I am pleased to say that Victory Brewing Co. have outdone themselves with DirtWolf. Being that Sierra Nevada is one of the few other craft breweries to use whole-cone hops exclusively, whole-cones have a personality all unto themselves and Victory's offerings (along with their yeast strain) possess a unique aroma and flavor that is altogether difficult to describe.

"The roasted pale malts stand up on the first sip but those snazzy floral and piney hops have too much of an ego to be kept down...so they jump forward. However they know when enough is enough so they end in a subtle, yet bitter fashion. This is wonderfully balanced and both subtle and vibrant at the same time. I could drink several of these."

"O - Been on a DIPA kick for a few weeks after having a Maximus. Trying to hit a few I have not had before, and this (and Hop Stoopid) were on the list and readily available here. This seems more hop forward balance wise than some of the others I have had recently (Maximus, 2xIPA, Hoptimum) but is pretty solid."

"Excellent offering. I don't understand the low scores from people who admit they are not in to hops - why on earth did you buy/try this. Victory continues to wow the hops crowd - now I hope they get Hop Wallop back on the shelf along with this wonderful brew!!"
""
"Wow - a hop tsunami that engulfs the senses! Impressive. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour possess a heady mélange of fruity aromatic hops, intense bitterness and subtle malt. Lovely body - nicely judged on all counts. While the malt and yeast are subdued they balance the hops perfectly. A sterling effort and a hophead's delight - if you love hops then this is well worth seeking out."

"Poured from 12 bottle into a tulip. Slight white head that dissipates fairly quick. Golden orange to straw in color with touches of pink grapefruit mixed in. Citrus for sure in the aroma, lots of grapefruit and even a touch of pineapple and lime. Citrus comes through again in the taste with a hop bitterness that doesn't really kick you in the teeth or leave you wanting. Not a whole lot of maltiness, but just enough to smooth it out a touch. I was quite surprised by the creaminess of the feel here, looked like it would have a lighter body. Awesome DIPA!"

"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Just off-white head forms and dissipates quickly, leaving slight lacing around the upper rim of the glass. Beautiful light orange color, slightly cloudy. Nose is strong citrus, with a bit of pine and a twinge of sharp bitterness. Taste follows, bright orange and lemon flavors balanced by a bitter kick at the end. All flavors are very smooth, this one's a bit lower on the sweet/malty scale in favor of the hop blast. Light and pleasant mouthfeel. Overall, a great DIPA, not quiet on level with the very top tier, but for the availability and price this is one of the best value beers available. Thanks Victory, for making something so great so incredibly accessible."

"This is a beer that absolutely matches it's hype. Didn't have a chance to do a side by side with a fresh Nugget Nectar, but that's a challenge top throw down next winter. I reccommedn this beer to well, everyone. It's that good."
"O- This is an enjoyable DIPA, I don't think it stands above the other high end DIPA's but it certainly doesn't sink below either. I would definitely buy this again."

"O- Great job here. Packs a hop punch and is up there with my favorite super-hopped ales. Price and availability make this a staple next to our milk and eggs in the fridge. I think Victory hit a home run if you're looking for a strong IIPA."

"The palate opens with a moderate sweetness, simple in nature with sugar and honey and (thankfully) minimal caramel flavors. Along with this is a moderate hop flavor - honey, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, peach, and, unlike the palate, some candied citrus - are all present. Bitterness is moderate and thoroughly enjoyable, mildly resiny, moderately oily and quite nice. The sweetness is surprising - this has the sweetness I expect from a good triple IPA (Notorious?) but the hop character of a good DIPA. Carbonation is a little bit on the high side, but all told, this is a solid DIPA that I will likely buy again, especially if I see it fresh."

"Poured a cloudy medium gold with a big creamy white head. The head has good retention and leave some sticky lacing throughout the beer. The aroma is lighter but it has nice distinct floral, citrus and pine notes balanced against a slight malt sweetness. The taste is similar but just a little more robust. But it has all the same dimensions as the aroma. The mouthfeel is also lighter for such a hoppy style but its not watery. There is a slight bite from the hops on the finish. It's a lighter flavored but not lacking DIPA."

"O: it's got a nice twist of flavors besides grapefruit, and they work well together -- too many American DIPAs come off as a mess of caramel/mango that I can't stand, but this brew has a few hints of tropical fruit flavor while still maintaining that tasty grapefruit note. I'd have to drink this side-by-side with some of my favorite IPA/DIPA grapefruit bombs to get a better handle on where it fits in my personal ranking, but the bottom line is it's very good and hides a healthy load of alcohol completely."
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer and reminds me of two beers I really like, Lagunitas Sucks and Hopslam. However, I'm not sure that it combines the best elements of those two. The bitterness is a bit much and I would like to see more of a malt presence. This does correct itself a little bit as the beer warms, but I think it could still be improved. An excellent to-style brew but the bitterness prevents this from being one that I would go back to often"
""
""
"This hits the mark. Spectacular. Bought a 4-pk in The Andersons General Store in C-Bus OH and poured into my trusty tulip. Very fresh (but to Greg's chagrin... no bottle dates). Good thing that I trust The Andersons. Light golden hue (exactly what I aim for in my homebrewed IPAs; and never achieve) with 1/2 finger of marshmallow white head which left some lacing. Not a huge nose (especially compared to the fresh Citra-Hero from earlier), but a good nose. Very fresh... notes of citrus and pine. This was also v. cold from the fridge, and the aromas amplified a bit as I nursed this beauty. Lemon zest and a shockingly clean bitterness opened the salvo... with a huge PUNCH of pine on the end. Something about the clean taste of this beer... follow me here, makes it taste like you are drinking it off of an ice block (circa 1997 frat parties in run down colonials in Bloomsburg PA; in a GOOD way). Just amazingly refreshing. Great IPA mouthfeel. Good carbonation, crisp, a bit dry, and not oily. Again, clean comes to mind. I never knew that something that was so clean could come from the Philadelphia area (just kidding, let's go Mets). I don't really have to tell you to buy this, do I?"

"Fresh , tapped - growler filled. Nice copper color. Big brew, but you can't tell right away. Huge hop presence all the way through the last sip and smooth, Enough sweetness reminiscent of honey maybe? just to balance this great beer. A wonderful beer to share with others (as is most beer) but this one is impressive to everyone."
""

"Overall: Not my favorite IPA. I had high hopes with the tropical fruit aroma, but the tart/sour Simcoe flavor let me down. What I liked about Lagunitas Sucks, I can't seem to enjoy in DirtWolf."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid, well-made West Coast style imperial IPA, but maybe it doesn't quite live up to all the accolades it has received. I'm not really sure what all the fuss is about. Reminds me a bit of Lagunitas Sucks. Although, to be fair, I love Lagunitas Sucks."
""

"Pours a pale amber body with a frothy white inch of head. Staircase lacing cascaded across the sides. Dirt wolf is an appropriate name because his has huge rustic aroma. Dirt, vegetable matter, twigs, pine needles, moss and tree sap. Grapefruit and spice come through once it warms. Taste is straight citrus rinds, lemons and peppery spice. Loads of citrus in a prickly medium body. Crisp and clean flavors and a complimentary dose of bitterness along with spiced booze."

"If I had to make a choice, I'd prefer 21st Amendment Hop Crisis.  But Dirtwolf is my """go to""" DIPA because it's always available and it's damn good."
""
"This one's big, bold and sharp. Where's my aged cheddar? It's complex off the bat, as the smell is. Lemony citrus, pepper and earth, juicy bread, orange citrus rind, grapefruit, pine and grass. Bitterness bites hard. Creamy, slightly sticky, nicely carbonated and highly drinkable. This is what I like in the department of stinging DIPA's. Superb really."

"Poured into a glass. Clear golden-orange with persistent 1/2""" off white head. Piney and dank aroma mixed with some citrus and tropical fruit - nice. Taste is similar with more tropical fruit mixed with pine and spice, moderate bitterness and slightly sharp. Seems a little watery but otherwise great mouthfeel. Overall, very nice DIPA."
"Good beer! Among the top IPAs.. Great label on the beer.. Victory is pretty consistent at brewing good beers.. I think this was one of there best.. Nice hoppy citrus taste.. Well deserving in being one of the top 250 beer list..If this beer is available at the liquor store it would be hard to pass up on.."
""
"O: This beer is dangerously drinkable. While 8.7% ABV isn't monumentally high, I would have hazarded a guess of roughly 6% ABV (or less) based on what I could taste and feel. While I think this beer may be a tad overrated, it is absolutely a quality DIPA that stands above many of my personal favorites. I would highly recommend this brew to anyone who enjoys DIPAs."
""
""
""
"O- It's tough to not come off as a homer for this one. Victory is on the other side of the state from me so this one is available for a great price point which has made it a main stay as I usually buy it by the case. After drinking so much of this I know this beer hits its sweet spot about 2 weeks after its bottled and packed.They used Simcoe, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic hops on this one and I loved what they did with them. A mix of a few old school hops with some newer tough to get ones. They let the hops control the show in this one but its not quite the hop bomb that a Heady topper is. I wonder what yeast they used in this because I feel like its contributing some of the Mango/peach notes in this one. Either way this is an excellent beer no matter how you cut it even if you don't have to travel to the ends of earth to get it."

Clean, crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Overall the aroma of the beer did not match the taste but for me this made for a wonderful beer. Great DIPA that I can't wait to get my hands on again!"

"O: A very nice DIPA. Interesting - but not a negative - that the piney taste didn't follow the citrus aroma. The very hop-centric finish is an explosive contrast to the easy beginning, and makes this a memorable brew."

"EDIT 15 June 2014: Another bottle confirms my initial review."
""
""
"wow, I have been a fan of the Victory beers from way back in the day when I lived in DC. Moved to AZ ten years ago and could not get it until recently. when it came available a few months ago, I immediately picked up some of the Prima Pils and it lives up to my memory and remains a great pilsner. being a huge IPA and double and imperial IPA guy, I was really excited when I noticed DirtWolf at Total Wine. I got a growler and brought it home to pair with some rare seared sushi grade salmon and kale salad. dinner was great, but in short the DirtWolf was a drain pour, a waste of $6.99 IMO. it wasn't like the keg was bad, maybe it was, but rather this beer seemed to have the hop profile, but it seems like a one dimensional beer, no backbone to speak of, flat tasting yet with seeming plenty of carbonation. vinegar like. just kind of a cheap IPA. I would probably buy a 12oz bottle one time to try it again to see if I had a bad batch or if I just wasn't in the mood, but from the growler experience this stuff is not good. I dumped it."

"O - Flavorful and drinkable IPA. Low alcohol presence. Just had it back to back with Jai Alai, super similar just a bit more pine, alcohol, and body."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. The minimal head that is produced fades rather quickly leaving only a slight ring accompanied by substantial lacing. Resulting color is a medium gold that is wonderfully opaque. Aroma is mostly true to form: Flowery and bold. I did note hints of burnt toast which was not expected but neither was it deterring. Outstanding taste that leaves zero doubt that you are experiencing a hearty double IPA... Very bold. Mouth feel is obvious and lingers. This double IPA outshines its beloved predecessor - Hop Wallop - while not losing any of Wallop's appealing characteristics. The hop blend used is outstanding and is balanced to near perfection. Bonus points to Victory for its creative labeling."

I do recommend it."

"O - This beer is walking a tightrope, and it could easily fall down the rabbit hole, but it avoids the more offensive onion flavors of Hop Ranch. It does not, however, and the result is a satisfying beer."

"This was a game changer for me as I was never too fond of DIPA's.Hoppy luscious,delicious,there are no more words for this that can describe this beer and the taste.I have not had any other beer in 3 months other than chillwave(another great new DIPA) but far and away I drink this 3 times as much."

"I was very happy with their Hop Devil and thought I couldn't go wrong trying this one. I was right! Smooth, deep and delicious. Looking forward to its next appearance. This will be in my beer rotation for sure. I'm very pleased with Victory and would try any of their other beers. :)"
""
"with all they hype around this one, i have been eagerly waiting for it to arrive fresh in denver, and finally it did. i have to say, while this is a damn good ipa, its not as distinct and unique as i want it to be, and realize maybe how spoiled we are out here with good hoppy beer, this is great, but not world class in a colorado context. hazy blonde, almost greenish tint to the gold, with an inch or so of lasting white head. it smells simcoe heavy, and the mosaic is probably the most subdued of the listed hop varietals. forceful bitterness in the nose doesnt make it to the flavor through, instead a softer, more floral vibe hangs around, delicate for a big ipa, and given how well the alcohol is hidden, one could easily get into some trouble with this one. layers of hop flavor from fresh pine to grapefruit peel, i like the diversity but the cohesiveness as well. not a ton of bitterness either. the feel rocks, soft but aggressive carbonation prickles the tongue, and opens my senses up to receive this hop complex more completely, its just right with the medium body. for my palate, more robust mosaic would make this, but i like the use of whole leaf hops, it makes a difference, and i love the way it feels. great beer from victory, but an eyelash below my lofty expectations for it, given the hype."

"O- This hit the spot. It was refreshing and easy to drink, but plenty of flavor."
"As with all the great DIPA's the bitter builds to an attractive hue on the back of the tongue forming a very pleasant mouthfeel. Lovely drinkable for such a big beer."

"I really enjoyed this one. I had heard a lot of buzz about it and was expecting to be disappointed, but it was really wonderful. Poured a beautiful golden yellow with very tight bubbles and a nice pillowy head. Nose is all hops - strong dried pineapple, citrus fruits, some peach and apricot. There is pine there as well but the fruit aroma was strongest. Taste follows the nose closely - lots of fresh pineapple juice with some peach in there. No hint of the 8.7% in there at all, though it is very, very sweet - strong honey-ish malt profile, some yellow box cake sweetness. Some mango in there as well. The mouthfeel started creamy but ended dry and made me want more. Overall this was great and really delightful. Will certainly have again."

"I have been into IPA's and DIPA's lately, maybe its the season. Maybe its because Hopslam this year was so damn good. I have had a few Victory beers years ago, but I thought I would revisit this one and I got this one at a good deal at a local place that was running a storewide sale, So I figured what the hell? This one has a nice hazy golden color too it, not too many floaties in it, which has been common this year, it was smooth but left a bitter bite on the back of the palate which lingered for a while. It is nearly 9% abv which might get too you because overall its pretty smooth for a DIPA, It does have an earthy dirty dankness to it, which I liked. I am planning on doing a review of Stone Enjoy by as a comparison, because I have heard it described as dank as well. This is a good beer and I actually have two four packs to go through so I am happy of my purchase and may give Victory a chance again. I truly did enjoy this one and look forward to working through the two wolfpacks I purchased, I just wish they had it in six packs, but sometimes that is the way of the world."
""
"O- This is a terrific Double IPA brew from Victory....worth a case in my eyes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a great double IPA. The taste starts with a bursting floral hoppiness. I also detect some pineapple and mango. The floral flavors then transition into a piney taste with slight citrus. The pine lingers on the tongue and is very pleasant. The finish is very refreshing leaving you wanting more. This is fairly easy to drink and could get me into trouble with the higher alcohol content. A very good offering from victory."
"Pours a hazy light gold color with a finger and a half of bright white head that settles down to nothing after a minute. Yeast floaties abound at the bottom of the glass. The grapefruit and pine smells are overwhelming in this one and hit you right as you pour the glass. There's also a ripe mango, some clean malts, and a floral quality to the nose. Grapefruit again shows up big in the taste, with lemon peel, grass, mouth-coating hop resins, and clean, sweet malts. It finishes dry and very bitter. There's a nice level of carbonation in this beer that tingles the back of the mouth and enhances the sting of the hop bomb."
"Sticky mouthfeel, but unfortunately doesn't have the deep, thick mouthfeel of the best big IPAs. Great beer though, with some nice flavors waiting to be teased out."
"After reading reviews of this beer, I feel like I'm drinking a different beer. The aroma reminds me of underarm sweat, really off putting. The same quality comes across in the taste. Victory usually makes a pretty decent beer but I think they missed the mark on this one. I wouldn't buy this again. I bought a 4 pack and it's going to be a chore to polish it off. Really disappointing beer."
""
""
"O: this is a delicious beer. I will definitely be getting more of this. Would recommend to anyone who loves hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an amazingly delicious IIPA. Probably the best I have had. This beer is better that Hopslam and goes toe to toe with Sucks. Also the price and availability can't be beat. A world-class beer."
"Cheers all!"

"O. Standing out with a new beer in the DIPA category is no simple task. Victory has done it with DW. This is a well crafted beer - one that will be in my fridge year round."
""
"The beer poured a straw yellow to gold with a huge pillowy white head with good retention and lacing. It was slightly hazy as there were bits of sediment in the bottom of my glass, but nothing like that detracts from a beer in my book. The aroma was full of dank tropical fruit hops with a hint of peach underneath. The taste was a full hop explosion that started with the tropical fruitiness and dank tones that melded into citrus notes that ended in bitter prickly pine that danced on my palate and lingered between tastes. This was definitely a big aromatic and multidimensional Double IPA that was easily drinkable and a well executed beer. Very fruity and very balanced."

"Overall: I can see why this is loved so much. However, I enjoy Hop Ranch more, but these two are good examples of two excellent IPAs that are very different."

""
""
""
"This is as good of a drinking DIPA around. Can certainly do more than 1 and only the alcohol will be the issue. I suppose 3 could lead to a hop hangover, but in the right circumstances I may take a chance on that."

"Overall: This is a really nice DIPA by Victory. Nothing mind blowing, but just a great 6 pack beer that will keep hops heads returning to purchase more."

"Doesn't have the balance or chewy body I prefer in a IIPA."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by good flavors and aromas."
""
"O- An excellent DIPA, a much better year around then their previous Hop Wallop."
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderfully complex flavors and aromas from the combination of hops used in this DIPA - not as sweet or bitter as some others in the style but that probably makes it a little easier to drink. Very enjoyable and definitely a brew I would grab again though I can probably only have one in a session due to taste bud fatigue. One of the best new beers I have had from Victory in quite a while."
""
""

""
""
""

"O- This is a pretty good DIPA I just don't really care for the flavor of the bitterness in this one though. It's something I have fond I don't like in the Mosaic hop. It's funny because in Great Lakes Chillwave I didn't get any of the herbal bitterness at all just sweet peach and tropical candy. Apart from that though the Simcoe does come out and all other aspects of this beer are great. Definitely like this one more than Hop Ranch."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall this is an extremely solid offering from Victory. Anyone who enjoys grapefruit-forward DIPA's will love it. The flavors are pretty simple and straightforward, but very well executed. This has become a regular in my rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This brew is everything good from IPAs pulled into one. You get that palate wrecking bitterness, it's a slap to the taste buds, the bitterness opens the palate to the refreshing character of the hops, very fruity, citrus, pineapple, mango, tropical goodness, ends with this wonderful resin that will end dry. This is a great beer. Don't be mistake, this is a big aggressive beer. But wonderfully crafted."
""
""
""
""
"It is very hop forward in a citrus manner... Hops all the way through the waves of taste. Not much of a malt foundation, but this IPA doesn't need the antidote to the hops bitterness... Just enough sweetness there to not miss the malty underpinning you might taste in a 90 minute, for example. Distinct, refreshing and complex enough to keep coming back for more... Hops hops and more hops."
"Overall: Well, then. $9.45 for a 4 pack well spent!"

"DirtWolf is a classic verison of modern Imperial IPA- all the fruit notes in tact, less than dominant herbal tones and a dryness that reminds me that its still an IPA- check, check, check! Yet I look for that one dominant character to shoot the beer into the stratosphere. Where that may be lacking, it seems that this beer is only great!"
""
"O: DirtWolf is an excellent brew that has pushed its way into my list of all-time favorites. All of the complexity and flavor of a DIPA with the drinkability of a regular IPA. At 8.7%, this brew is deadly. Victory has truly outdone themselves with DirtWolf—a masterpiece, if I may say so."

"O. Worth the wait, this & hop ranch are excellent beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great hop aroma and flavoring diversity. Not as sweet as some examples, but the flavoring hops prevent it from seeming terribly bitter. Good balance. The resin is a little overpowering in the finish. But, my mouth is watering for more. As it warms, the onion becomes a little much."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This respectable DIPA successfully captures hops qualities without really stumbling. The range of qualities runs from orange citrus, to pine, to savory onion; while the sappy tropical fruit of some other modern recipes is lacking, it is not particularly missed. No other qualities really threaten to obscure or distract from the hops."

"The Verdict: Delicious. Full of flavor while still hiding the high ABV, this is a winner. The longer I’m on the west coast the more I fall in love with all of the great breweries out here, but Victory, Stillwater, and Dogfish Head remain at the top of my list."
""
""
""
""

"The only thing you need to know about Dirtwolf is that it's a top-notch, must drink beer. One of the best IPA styles you can drink. I could sit and type about the 50 different flavors and smells I come across, from a baby's bottom, to fresh outerspace vaccum, to bigfoot's velvet fur, to fresh cultivated diamonds in Western Africa. But I'll let the beer snobs present you with all that BS. It's just an amazing beer, easy to drink at 8.7%, a great price point, and will mess you up. So don't believe the hype of other IPAs, or family members related. No review needed - just drink it and see for yourself."

"O - Definitely good for what it is, but ultimately over-hyped. The complexity just isn't there to make it a 5/5 selection."
"The crisp bite remains through the sip in the not-quite-full, deep medium body while carbonation is moderate and puts up a nice smoothness that's pretty creamy and rolls well. It starts of close to semi-dry and ends up in a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a great DIPA that's very drinkable for an 8.7% ABV beer. Remarkably light."
""

"Pours a hazy straw color with a thin white head that clings to the edges and doesn't quite cover the surface in patchy bubbles. The color looks like a saison, while the head reminds me more of a pale ale. Lacing is lacking, with the bubbles falling back into the drink. Slippery instead of sticky. Lots of pine with lemon and grapefruit, some pitch, and a hint of sweet fruit like apricot. Flavor is surprisingly sweet, but not close to cloying. Like a Mexican sweet bread made with darker flour and a kiss of lemon. The back end is smooth but decidedly bitter with the citrus and pine playing their part. Finish is very dry, drying the mouth, and the body is rock solid. This is a very good double IPA more in line with the West Coast style where the hops really shine and the malt gets out of the way. This goes the Lagunitas route with the sweet malt, making it a showcase, but not the main event. I wouldn't mind having this more regularly and I'm glad Victory is back in the Bay Area."
""
"A nice, solid DIPA but I have had better DIPAs. The taste was fairly clean and crisp and the hops were not over-powering as they can be in some imperial IPAs. The smell was a little off-putting and the nose almost had a spoiled or infected scent. Overall though, a very good brew!"
""
""
"Overall this is an excellent beer. Victory: please distribute to Nevada"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to read the print on bottle, but I'm quite certain this was fresh. This beer improves considerably- even more so than other DIPA's I know- with warming, almost to room temp. A lovely hop aroma that stays true on the palate- some tropical fruit, blended with bouquet of flowers, herbs and spices. A splendid beer, on the cusp of the very best in this style, for me."
""
"Another fine DIPA. Reminds me of Hi-Res which I absolutely loved, maybe not as sweet. These are in cuuurushable territory."
"O - Very good, but not amazing DIPA. Too many other good ones out there to get too excited about this one. Solid, well made and highly enjoyable, but just not wowing me either. I had high expectations on this one - can't say I am really disappointed, but didn't live up either. I would easily get this again, but wouldn't go crazy looking for it."

"Overall not bad, about what I expect from a nice DIPA, big earthy spicy hops, pine, resin, little citrus, etc, with a decent malty sweet balance, again well done beer for Victory."
""
""
""
""
"Color me impressed. There are many double IPAs out now, but not a lot of really, really good ones. This definitely falls into the that range. Not overly bitter, but hugely hoppy, and the hop varieties they chose make a great team. It doesn't wear its big ABV like a badge of honor, but keeps it under wraps. This is just a big ol' tasty fruit cocktail of a brew, and absolutely worth finding. Great beer."

"O) Pretty good stuff... Not smooth by any means, and the aftertaste could be better, but I could go for another already."

""

""
""
""
""
"O ) One of the most fantastic IIPA's I've had in a while. Well pronounced aromas and flavors leave you wanting more - though watch out for the alcohol @ 8.7% it will catch up to you quick if you don't blow out your taste buds on the hops first"
""
""
""
"Excellent copper hue, quite a lot of smooth hoppiness, a bit more alcohol and because of it can creep up on you fast. Very pleasant citrusy nose. Compares well to double IPAs from Stone and southern Tier. It was served in a snifter glass and I waited a little while for it to open up."
"A well crafted impressive DIPA. Given the chance to develop this is one satisfyingly complex beer, taste is fantastic and everything is in quite harmony. A winner, glad I was able to try this."
""
""
"Pours a pretty clear, light straw color, with a great foamy head. Nice looking beer and the smell is delicious citrus hops with a touch of skunk. The taste follows suit. Powerful hop flavor that mixes the dank side with the citrus and not too bitter. It's got enough body, but feels light and the alcohol is well hidden. A solid DIPA that drinks like an IPA. Definitely the most impressive beer I've had from Victory and one of the most exciting new offerings this year. Fast becoming a staple!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too bitter for my personal taste. Fans of Ruination and Hoptimum will really enjoy this one. I'd much rather prefer Hop Wollap to DirtWolf."
""
"Overall: an extremely high quality beer that is quite drinkable bit extremely satisfying. Also a tremendous value."
"O-I am a late arrival on the DirtWolf hype train, but I was glad to have hopped aboard (no pun intended). This beer manages to carve out its own flavor niche in a world of super fruity, juicy IIPAs, and for that I give it props. I also enjoy the balancing malt. I could not, however, get over the onion that I kept noticing, especially on the finish. I tasted three different bottles with the same result. Oh well...another good IIPA on the shelves is a good problem to have."
""
""
"I purchased a single bottle at the specialty shop for about $2.50. It has quite a citrus punch with enough hoppiness to give it that bitterness. This is a great double IPA. just recently had Hop Devil and Prima Pils from Victory and I have to say I like those two a lot as well."

"As a fan of Victory Brewing I was quite excited to finally see this in my area. This ale pours a hazy golden amber color with a lot of white head that gives way to a nice film and substantial lacing. The nose is the best thing about this beer. It is super fresh and hoppy. Lots of notes of citrus, pine, and some great skunky weed. There is a slightly malty note but it is minimal at best. The beer pours fairly thick and sticky definitely on the heavier side of medium bodied. The flavor is hoppy and citrus but not overly so. There is more malt on the tongue than there was on the nose. This bottle seems very fresh and is quite good but I feel Victory's Hop Ranch is a better offering on the whole. That being said, I'd never pass this up if I saw it in a store again."

"Overall this is easily one of the best DIPAs out there and one of my favorite beers ever.  This was my second from Victory (after Hop Ranch) and has since became a regular, because it is just that good."
""
""
"Easily an inch thick head of tightly woven white foam. Somewhat hazy golden yellow hue. Brussels lacing. Pungent aroma of citrus hops greets my nose. Mouth is a bit thick and slightly chalky,but pretty easy going for a DIPA. The front of the palate is an intense burst of citrus hop bitterness and and nice hop burn on the fade. Don't get me wrong,there is a light malt backbone,but this is a hop bomb."

"O - One of my favorite DIPAs. It's called Dirtwolf, but they're not doing hops for the sake of hops. Absolutely well balanced drink. That being said, don't pick 'em up if you don't like hops. Leave more for me."
""
""
""
"Overall: not sure what the best IPA I've tasted but this is one of them. Outstanding."
""
"O - A great offering from Victory at a reasonable price. Not sure if I like this or Hop Ranch more, but it looks like I scored Hop Ranch a bit higher. Both are my type of IIPAs."

"Honeyed color with light orange hues in lower light conditions, with medium sized white head that dissipates after a few minutes. Nose has a good blend of citrus, pine, and herbs. Complex. Palate offers a nice balance too with plenty of hop character, background malt, and an overall drinkability that is sadly uncommon in most DIPAs on the market today. DirtWolf could easily be a daily beer for me."

"So, this is a hazy, golden, ultra-hopped, slap-in-the-face beer. It's high in alcohol, incredibly hoppy and bitter, and very, very enjoyable. The beer has a slim head, moderate lace, and some serious effervescence. The smell is of earthy, fresh, herbal hops. Some malt is behind the hops, but far, far behind (it's been lapped). The taste is not at all balanced...spicy, peppery, tingly hops...and some serious warming and spritzy carbonation. Beautifully interesting. The finish is bitter and lingering. Expected, and not exceptionally creative, but this is a full force, very enjoyable, serious beer."
""
"Unimpressive, just another DIPA, like drinking a bitter perfume. Glad I only bought a four-pack."
"Overall: I don't think Dirt Wolf lives up to the hype. Maybe it's because I've been indulging in Enjoy By, Head Hunter, Chillwave, etc., but it seems too watery, and whatever good flavors are there, are muted, borderline astringent, and comes off as a bit of an imitation of the greats in my opinion. However, this beer is still solid, local to me, and reasonably priced, which is why I keep coming back."
"Straw yellow body. Mild haze. Thick, foamy, white head with lasting retention. The aroma offers pine, biscuits...hold up, let me blow my nose. ok, there we go...where was I? Oh yeah, pine, biscuits, resinous hops. Perhaps a touch of tropical fruit in the flavor, but not much. Alcohol presence is certainly there, but not overly so. Definitely a balance of malt to hops, though favoring the hop character. Medium to full bodied for the style. Lingering hop bitterness and bready notes. Overall, pretty tasty."
""
""
""
"O: a very good DIPA, quite sweet with good hop flavors"
""
""
""
"O- I am a fan of citrusy DIPA's, and this one didn't disappoint. Loaded with resiny hops, yet super drinkable. This is one of my new favorites"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't enjoy one aspect of this beer. Even if it was a little past it's prime for an IPA, it was downright terrible. I never get that """onion""" note that people talk about, but I got it full force on both the nose and the tongue in this beer. No thanks."
"O - It's not your standard IPA. I think I'll revisit this brew from time to time. Recommended . Cheers!"

"O: Overall so smooth, perfectly balanced with a high regard towards drinkability. So smooth and polished bringing a ton of fresh and wet nature upfront followed by a beautiful soft complimentary bitterness on the trail. Honestly the growler never stood a chance. The balance and polished nature of this beer is just so harmonous it will be near impossible to just have one, or two, or three. Not to be a factor the price point at $12 a growler is perhaps the best bargin in craft beer i have ever had and ends up easily as a possible top five double ipa canidate in my book. It is worthy the hype, seeking out, waiting in line and multiple case purchasing (and this comes from a guy who primarily drinks em one and done as singles). Dont worry about the hops expiring, the cases will never sit around that long. A definite wow factor beer for me."

"I poured it into a glass, it has a nice orange color body with a small head. The aroma has a citrus and hop smell to it. The taste has a nice citrus and bitter hop notes with some malt coming in on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and overall a damm good dipa."

"Fairly dark for a double IPA huge hints of citrus, grapefruit, lemon on the nose. Very citrusy, slight pine, more grapefruit on the back end very little malt presents but that doesn't throw off the balance at all. Very smooth and drinkable, the alcohol is hidden extremely well and makes for a very crisp clean finish that has you craving that next sip!"
""
"O - easy drinking DIPA considering the ABV."
"M: dry finish. low carbonation, relatively speaking"
""
""
""

"Appearance is a pale orange with thin white head and heavy lacing. The nose features heavy pine hops with notes of mango, tropical fruit, resin, and deep grapefruit notes. The hops are pungent in the nose! The flavor starts with a bitter assault of pine hops which is followed up by fruit, orange, grapefruit, with heavy bitterness throughout. This definitely packs a huge bitter punch with mild malt character mixed in. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with moderate body. Overall, a nice hop assault with a high IBU content, a little one dimensional, but for those that appreciate that dimension, this is a great beer."

"On tap at ABV in NYC. Pours a nice clear gold- hue with a finger that settles to a really nice espresso like head. the color is brighter and more translucent than most other DIPAs I've had. Aroma is subtle - not a huge nose on this one at all. Taste is fantastic- really emphasizes the hops without a boozy contribution which can sometimes interfere with the taste in DIPAS, in my opinion. There's a nice, clean hop bitterness that lingers on the back. Mouthfeel is also great- light and not sticky or chewy at all like a lot of DIPAS I've had. More like a low abv ipa mouthfeel, which is amazing for an 8% double. Overall, One of the best DIPAS I've had in awhile, glad to see Victory come out with something great as I had kind of lost interest in them recently."

"This beer has a nose that imparts a lot more than that which comes to the palate. From smelling it, you have the impression of a big double IPA- with all its piney-big-hop goodness- and get something light-bodied, with subdued malts and delicious west coast hop flavors. Mint, melon, jackfruit (bubblegum), and of course citrus, come forward balanced out with malt sweetness, and a great lingering bitterness, followed with the alcohol. A well balanced, and what comes across as pretty sessionable DIPA."

"Overall a nice DIPA. I really like that it's not over sweet, or cloying as some Double IPAs can be. Victory has a winner on their hands."

"O: good sippin’ version of a double IPA."

"Overall: Very good DIPA. The aesthetics of this beer make it definitely above average (appearance and feel). The flavor and and aroma aren't quite as good as some of the big names, but I would definitely recommend this beer and will absolutely drink it again. [3.75]"

"12oz. bottle served in a willibecker. Enjoy by May 24th, 2014 on the neck of the bottle. Pours a translucent golden-orange with a loose, sudsy, one inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a frothy cap. Swaths of lacing coat the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus zest, a hint of tangerine sweetness and an earthy/musty character. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a suggestion of Simcoe hops (aka cat pee) spice and pineyness in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation that offers a bit of a bite at the finish. An interesting an complex DIPA. Not something I would consider a go-to for the style, but really quite enjoyable. Nice job Victory!"
""
"O: Great, hoppy DIPA that has enough malt to it as well to appeal to both schools of IPA thought. Not the """world class""" rating most have been giving it, but that's not at all a bad thing. I'd drink DirtWolf any day."

"Poured an auburn gold body with good head and lace. A juicy, crispy, citric hop profile in the aroma and the taste is the same. Classic DIPA as it is light bodied, easy to drink, hops aplenty and not only citric notes but some grapefruit. Very little sweetness but it's there for balance and the beer finishes crisp and refreshing. Just a simple but sessionable strong IPA that is a must try."

"Overall, this is a great dipa, love the huge hop aroma and great balance in the taste and mouthfeel - hard to create a brew this big without it coming off cloying in bitterness or sweetness, but this is very well done."

"Victory remains one of America's great microbreweries, but I've become less and less impressed with their brands the more I try from the country's other craft brewers. Up and down their lineup is nothing but solid, but, to be sure, one can now easily find comparable and better offerings. DirtWolf is a good DIPA, but it's far from the best."
""
"Overall - Pretty good. What people would call balanced, but I call too sweet."
""
"I poured easy into a 12 oz beer mug, ended up with about ¼” of white head that lasted about two minutes. The body was golden-yellow, bright, and clear. The beer looks like it has a fairly thin body for a DIPA, but I don’t think Victory aspired to achieve balance…this beer is clearly about the hops. In fact, American hops crush your nose from the time you pop the crown. At first, there is some subtle underlying pine scent, but the big ones are grapefruit and citrus. Clearly, this is a heavily hopped beer but is still less than that overwhelming dank bitterness you get in some DIPA’s. The citrus flavors help to keep this bitter beast palatable and the carbonation is medium, which makes it easy to drink. You are left with the pine and grapefruit after you drink, which subsides when you get the blast of citrus in your nose while enjoying your next sip. Overall, this is an enjoyable DIPA that I would drink again, but I was expecting a bit more based on what I have heard from others."
""
""
""
""
"O- The nose shows promise of a more tropical DIPA but then the hop bitterness almost demands your attention. Maybe once I get further into the beer and it warms it might allow the fruits to show but right now I can't pick them out with ease. EDIT: Definitely found the fruits! Grapefruit and orange wrapped in bitterness toward the end of the taste. As much as I fancy myself a stout or barley wine guy this and Hop Ranch are outstanding examples of why I drink IPA/DIPA."
""

""
""
""
""
"WOW I can not wait until this is actually on the shelves all year long, Hop Wallop was great, this is equally great. Both are pretty equal in my mind.... But now that Hop Wallop is off the shelves this needs to start filling its place so I can have one of them!"
"Working way through new double ipa styles and this was fantastic. This could take top billing from Prima Pils as my favorite out of victory. Freshness out of the bottle was superior. Hop character delivered without burning. Nice aroma and overall mouthfeel."
"Overall: Great IPA for the price. Super drinkable. It seems that more and more breweries are using Mosaic hops which have a truly unique and interesting hop profile. This one is certainly complex yet the Mosaic are the biggest player."
""
""
"O: A very interesting IPA unlike I'm used to here in CA but I like this. Aroma is great, taste is awesome and overall this beer is tasty."

"overall this is one to be missed when gone and the dirtwolf is now extinct in these parts. victory victorious again. one could only wish for some hop wallop to fall back on..."
""
""
"A pleasant, slightly bitter beer. It did not wreck your palate but had a moderate amount of sweetness. the carbonation was a bit above average. A long lingering finish is a nice touch by Victory."
""
"Features some of my favored hops. If they would of used Nugget instead of Citra, I may of had a beergasm. Overall some really nice hop flavors that compliment each other."
"This hop profile is a departure for Victory, IMHO. If you're a fan of Hop Devil or Hop Wallop, you may have to look twice at the label. It just doesn't seem like a Victory beer."

"Excellent double IPA, not overly sweet as some in the style and very bold in flavor and bitterness. Loved the tartness citric touch and the incredible hop complexity. I didn’t see that coming, I bought it randomly."
""
""
""
"Overall - Great creation from Victory and I am glad this will be a year round offering. Looking forward to having another soon."
"Beneath everything is a solid yet slightly sweet malt body which carries a moderately carbonated, full bodied blend of hop flavors across the tongue. Up front look for tropical hop flavors, pineapple, papaya and mango. Along the mid-palate is a tart-citric hop flash and bitter resinous piney presence. On the back end look for that bold brash rustic earthy bitterness. Finishes slick with a lingering bitterness and fruitiness that builds with every sip. An amazing blend of hops that showcases their fruity sweet characters and balances with their bold bittering properties. Mouthwatering to say the least. (At cooler temperatures you can taste more of those earthy bitter flavors while as the beer warms you can expect to taste more of the fruity sweet hop flavors)"
""
"Overall, nicely restrained, with a lot of nuanced flavors. Doesn't smack you in the face like a lot of DIPAs. It's strangely reminiscent of some sort of Ocean Spray cran-peach-guava juice. Quite tasty and drinkable."
""
"Resinous bitterness, slight citrusy sweetness, bready malt middle. Dry aftertaste, some dried citrus peel. Fairly smooth and easy to drink, abv is felt but not overbearing. It's good but not especially nuanced, not really a world beater in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Crisp amber body? Check. Small cream head, with decent lacing? Check. Sweet malts as a prelude to juicy fruity hops? Check. Nose finishes pine-ish, and round as a gumball. Tongue follows the same blueprint. This is not a groundbreaking beer by any means, but what it is is very delicious. Finish is sweet giving way to a gently abrasive finish. As I said this is not breaking any new ground, but it is extremely enjoyable. Would gladly grab another."
""
""
""
"O - I expected more. Unfortunately when there is a lot of hype for a product, there is an expectation that you cannot help but to have. There will be those who swear by this, and those that will not get it, not even for a minute. I fall somewhere in between, as I think it is worth a try, but does not rock my particular vote. Am going to grab some Harvest ales next...."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very bright, goldenrod coloring with sediment throughout and a steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. A sparse, film, bright white surface coat of head clings throughout while you drink. Aromas of wet, resinous hops, with bitter notes throughout, tangy citrus highlights of tangerine and grapefruit, subtle pine notes, and a rich caramel backbone. This smells pretty damn good! Flavors are roast and resin forward, with piney notes throughout. Subtle citrus highlights accent the bold malt backbone of caramel, and there are kicks of pepper, cut grass, pine tassel, and bitterness throughout. Very dynamic and layered palate, with a resinous undertone throughout that is a hophead's dream. Very tasty, and very drinkable despite increased ABV and heavier taste profiles. The body is robust and smooth, yet kept light with the increased carbonation. That same carbonation also helps clean up the finish, which comes together as a crisp, slightly effervesced, bitter finale. Great beer!"

"Solid stuff, quite drinkable without being overwhelming. Not sure if citra or mosaic, but quite pungent."

""
""
"I had another bottle of this and also had it on tap at Melt (without food). I'll stick with my rating, but it was better."
""
"Overall 3.5: Good beer and good example of the style. Not a hint of the massive ABV this bad boy packs, so be careful. However, let this beer stand as an example to other brewers: match the blended hop scent with care before you go into final production."
"O - good hop forward DIPA, but I'm finding all these Citra hopped beers to be so similar in flavor. This one is very well crafted, but I much preferred the old school DIPA, Hop Wallop, to this new-age DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a well-done wet DIPA, especially for the price of $10/4 pack. Very well-integrated and complex, with a really nice resinous mouthfeel. The nose suffers a little bit for some reason, however that is not enough to make me not recommend this beer to the hopheads out there."
""
"O - This bottle was just barely a month old, so I'm not sure if that had an impact, but this was a very mediocre DIPA. The aroma was definitely off. I'll try to re-review this at a later date with a super fresh bottle."
""
"Thick orange sap body with floating mass of white wash over top. Thick lacing develops on the sides of the glass. Aroma of grapefruit, citrus with rind, palm leaves, and sharp fruit soap. Flavors mirror the aroma but with a more pronounced grassiness, a bright lip-puckering fruit effect, and boozy undertones. Thick in body with medium carbonation. A standout beer for Victory. Not as menacing or dirty as its name suggests but rather a hoppy fruit bomb that will be familiar to any double IPA drinker."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Rich golden hue, only a slight head, and very light persistent lacing. Nose is bready with piny and lightly sweet components. Bitter and crisp, a bit of yeast, and some resiny sweetness for balance. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DirtWolf pours a golden color with a large frothy head. There is a floral and hoppy but sweet aroma. The taste is the same, bold floral and hoppy taste, but finishes sweet. Good and bold flavors, nice strong body. Overall its a very good beer, but a bit overrated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: Aug. 5, 2014. From a keg this time. Still easy drinking for a Double IPA. Hop presence is very nice. Assertive but user friendly. Hop character is not buried under a blanket of flat bitterness. Yum!"
""
"O: A lighter take on the double IPA, but still retains the complexity typical of the style. An above average beer that really with its unique aromas and mouthfeel. There was something missing in the taste department that would have set this beer apart."

"A very tasty, well done DIPA that I'm glad I was able to try."
""
""
"A very satisfying drink - built for sipping, not for quaffing."
"Enjoy by 3/27/14. Golden pour with a strong head that laces well. Nose is of hops, mostly earthy (dank) and citrus, but there is pine in the background. Light medium body with typical carbonation resulting in a smooth, but not slick, mouthfeel. The taste is a mixture of hops against a slight sweetness. Dank and citrus flavors are the most forward, with pine in the background. The bitterness component has grapefruit characteristics. Smooth finish with a lingering grapefruit tartness and bitterness over a nice dankcentric aftertaste. Well balanced overall."

"Hazy gold with a short, cream coloured cap of fine and sticky bubbles. Sharp hop aroma with lots of citrus zest and grapefruit, spicy and fruity, slight orange and an undercurrent of malt sweetness. The flavour was all citrus up front, then oranges, followed by lingering dry bitterness. Notes of mild malt sweetness, spicy zest and a bit of fruity tartness, slight tropical/pineapple character. Medium/full body with soft carbonation, sturdy mouthfeel. Overall, it felt very balanced, yet jammed full of American hops. Very enjoyable."
""
"Hands down my favorite beer of the moment. Absolute great taste. Citrusy, hoppy goodness. I found out about this beer through a friend. It came up because I still have not had Heady Topper and was told that in a blind taste test, this could pass for it. Im still not sold on that until I actually taste Heady Topper, but either way this beer is delicious. In fact I bought out the stock at this little store where I found it. I know its fairly new from Victory so go out and get it!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is remarkably good. Unique, and showing off all aspects of the hops within. A fantastic beer, at this price point or any other. For me, the best beer I've had all year. A must buy."
"O: One of my favorite DIPAs"
""
""
""
""
""
"Will look to get this on tap, and try it again...often."

"Nice hanging lacing, creamy foam. Smell of piney citrus lush fresh fruit in the flavor, especially pineapple. Has a nice spicy finish, taste is nice and long. Very much enjoyed."

"O- This is a damn good beer. It is both incredibly balanced and nicely complex. There are so many hop subtleties going on its hard to nail them down. Big aromas, big flavors. I will surely be drinking again."
""
""
"Grabbed a 4-pack at Triboro Beverage for $10 from their cooler. Mmm, delicious. This is the best IPA/DIPA from Victory I've had yet. There's a big citrus-mango aroma with a bit of resiny pine. The flavor gets a little spicier with a big, dry finish. It's not as rough a Hop Wallop, in a good way. This big, satisfying, but also reasonably drinkable. It's going to be hard not to crack open a second bottle. This beer's a real pleasure."
""

"Mouthfeel is great, tons of oils and resin are cut with a nicely balanced moderate to high carbonation to keep it refreshing and highly drinkable."

"O: DIrtWolf is an impressive effort from Victory -- they have rested on Hop Wallop for a long time and had produced some really good one-off DIPAs, but this would be an exceptional addition to their lineup, mainly due to the outstanding hops complexity in the aroma and flavor departments. A very delicious and satisfying beer -- great job by Victory on this one and I hope they keep up high production of this beer."
"Changed from one of the better dipas to one of the best. Once again the grapefruit is the dominant hop flavor, but the mouth feel is much more crisp and smooth as opposed to sticky. Maybe there's some variations between batches since the first time I had it (6 months ago), but at this point it tastes and feels much better.  (96/100)"
"Overall - A great IPA, listed as a double IPA. I would like it to be a little stronger for a double IPA. I prefer FIrestone's double jack but this one is definitely worth a go, great beer!"

"Do we really need another beer showcasing the citra and/or mosaic hop? Of course we do, as long as it's a good one! Thankfully, this one is. It has a terrific citrus fruit hop character and just a little sweetness to go with it. Definitely recommended."

"Overall this is a fantastic DIPA that I am planning on including in my regular rotation."
""

"Medium body and slightly oily with a blast of dry, hoppy bitterness that lingers over the pale malt, sweet fruit and boozy heat into a dry finish.  Again, the flavor is dominated by bitter, earthier hops with hints of grass, dank buds, resinous oils, pine sap and spruce tip.  Subtle tropical/citrus sweetness but this opens as it warms.  Lots of grapefruit with some pineapple and blood orange.  Very boozy with strong heat and alcohol sweetness in the finish taking away from the hop flavors.  Pale malt backbone with biscuit and cracker flavor that doesn't interfere with the hop bitterness.  Decent but too boozy for my preference and the strong alcohol flavor takes away from the interesting hop character. Feels more like 10+% beer and most of the interesting flavor falls off mid-palate."

"Verdict: A really delicious DIPA from Victory and easily the highlight of their lineup. The nose is really wonderful and while the flavors don't quite equal it's showing, this is still so nice to sip on. It's bitter and impactful, but soft around the edges and balanced quite well. I can't wait to finish my 4-Pack and get another soon."

"One of the finest, well-balanced and intriguingly complex IPAs I can recall having. Glad I ran across this at Coaltrain Wine and Spirits in Colorado Springs. The only down side is I only bought one four-pack. I highly suspect my next visit will leave me empty handed with this beauty."

"O: An amazing beer, was super surprised by this beer from Victory, well balanced and refreshing, one of the best DiPA'S I have ever had, hands down."
""
""
"T: Opens with pine and floral hop notes with a drawl of pine sap across the palate. Mint, caramel malt notes, sticky floral hop resin and another smattering of pine on the finish. Mouthfeel is a touch heavy, but the crisp carbonation keeps it from getting too much so. Good, but I don't think this is top tier."
""
"The beer pours a clear golden amber with a fluffy off-white head that fades into a thin halo around the glass circumference. The nose is a bit weaker than expected, though I can't determine exactly how fresh this bottle is. I gather some notes of citrus, pineapple, peppermint, and grass. The taste packs in the right amount of hoppy bitter-fruitiness and backbone malty sweetness with a slightly lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, quite effervescent, masked alcohol, not too bitter/sweet, slightly dry finish, and pleasant lingering bitterness. This drinks really easy for an 8.7% DIPA, I can see what the hype's about."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel could be a bit better: medium carb but a bit lacking on the consistency, I enjoy the heady smoothness or creaminess of some others better... very bitter/semi dry finish"
""
""
""
""
"O-this is actually a really good IPA. It different too. The weeds and bitterness and grains. Everything is perfectly blended to make an extremely drinkable beer. I really recommend this to others."
""
"Overall, a solid offering into a crowded style that reminds me of some other DIPAs I've had in a lot of good ways. There are a couple others I would likely pick up before this one, even if it was easily obtained in my neck of the woods. I imagine it's a pretty solid go-to for anyone in Victory's distribution footprint."
""
""
""
"O – This is a great example of a DIPA?IIPA. I’ve come to expect different from East Coast breweries, with huge malty presences, this is a great example of a break away beer. I’m happy that this has lived up to all of the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Pineapple and grapefruit, sweet toasted malt, and a big dose of piney hops. Great flavor and balance, and very nice blending of hops and malt. One of the best new Double IPA's I have had this year. Well done!!"
""
"O = Kudos Victory, you've really blown my mind with this one. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear body, golden in color, with a two finger thick head, fed by lively carbonation. The smell was perfumey and herbal hops with some citric smell. The taste was loaded with grapefruit, and very bitter. The whole flower hops were clearly the star attraction here, and the malt was very unobtrusive. The alcohol level was shockingly well hidden, as there was no burn of any kind. The finish was very dry, with an herbal bitterness. The beer was light and slippery in the mouth, providing a refreshing jolt of bitterness in each sip that did not linger on or coat the mouth. This was truly in the dry West Coast mode of DIPA presentation, and I love that style of beer."
"Pours out a deep orange-gold. Thin head. Hops in the nose are funky, herbal, earthy, and oniony. I pick up some bready malts in the smell as well. Malts are more candy-like in the flavor. Kind of sweet for me. Hops are solid, though, but I'd like more of that grassy/oniony flavor to break up the heavy maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy; a bit sticky. A little sweet for me, but the flavors are there."
""
""
"An excellent Double India Pale Ale."
""
""
""
"An extremely nice IPA- nice to see Victory breathe some new life into their IPA category. Pours a slightly hazy gold with a slight glow to it and a head that fades just a bit too quickly. The beer itself is delicious, with a deep hoppy fruitiness and a touch of pine to balance things, and some nice spice on the finish. The hops are also nicely balanced with the malt- not too heavy or sweet, but not too thin or acrid either. A job well done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An extremely solid, delicious, well balanced Double IPA with a hop forward attack, a great blend of flavors with almost no alcohol presence in the taste though it is there. It is a great double IPA. Is it better or close to Pliny or Heady? No, definitely not, but it is solid and if those beers are damn near impossible to get for you like they are for me, this is a solid replacement."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This was a fantastic IPA. The scent and taste and body were all excellent. The finish was surprisingly smooth, with well hidden alcohol. So it was easy to drink, but worth sipping. Yum!"
""
"A fortuitous day, given our sighting of a dirtwolf at Clemsonville. A majestic beast. Pours a gorgeous hazy gold. Luxuriously thick head, slowly dissipating and lacy. Nose is floral and festive for the beginning of this Advent season. Taste is lovey bouquets, but nothing close to the intense hop bitterness I was hunkering down for given the """imperial""" label. Wonderful balance and subtlety! DirtWolf doesn't bowl you over like a clumsy rhino, but rather hunts you down as a pack and brings you to where it wants to take you with time. Aftertaste is Christmas tree pine. The perfect ale for a family pack hunt for an evergreen."

"O-super hoppy beer. its like flower power mixed with tropical fruit. Really delicious and drinks very well for the relatively high abv"
"A great new DIPA and hopefully one that will be readily available as this was tasty, easy to drink and hid the ABV completely; this is a beer I could drink on a regular basis. Nice new addition to the Victory portfolio."
""
"Overall this was excellent. Glad I picked up several 4 packs."
"O - Excellent DIPA, in my opinion. Very nice flavor and easy to drink. I might have to grab another! I'm glad to see it lived up to the hype here on BA. I've had it in the fridge for a few weeks now but haven't gotten around to tasting it until now...I shouldn't have waited so long. Fortunately, this beer is pretty easy to find (for me at least...I found it at the liquor store here in town) which adds to my enjoyment. I'll definitely be picking up more of this in the future."

""
"O- do yourself a favor and buy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Id say that overall, this beer has perfect aroma and flavor. The smell is just perfect. The taste is just perfect. It shows how a double IPA can have a huge amount of hops, and yet, not have the grading heavy hop character to drown out all the other flavors. This beer is not balanced, but its not overpowering. Its a brew that has all its characteristics working together to deliver the best possible outcome. 5\5."
""
"O: By far my favorite Victory brew. Love a DIPA that doesn't have an overwhelmingly heavy malt presence - this fits that perfectly. This is practically dripping with juicy fruits and hops. An awesome surprise that I would recommend to any hophead."

"Since I can't get the Heady Topper regularly, this is my replacement. As a lover of big beers and preferably double, or triple ipas, the DirtWolf was destined to be right up my alley. However I didn't expect this beer to take over my palate and never let it go. I love this beer, fantastically floral and earthy it pops onto your tongue and placates it with a wealth of intense hops and dry malt back. A must buy and at a very reasonable price for the quality."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty awesome, the flavors tend to mush together a bit too much and the resinous qualities seem to dominate. I anticipate that changing once I get this beer around 50 degrees or so. I'll critique this as necessary"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, I'm really happy with this one. Very good, especially for a shelf IIPA that comes in a four-pack. Really well-done, and I anticipate this one making frequent appearances in the refrigerator. Recommended for sure."

"The alcohol led to this feeling as well, as it was certainly present but by no means could I taste it at any time during my time savoring this. This may say Imperial but don't be fooled - this handles like a regular IPA with a bit more complexity and less bitterness than one would expect. That's a great thing but not nearly as great as discovering this for yourself - Victory has a winner here and the only shame with this beer is that it comes in 4-packs, since I'm craving more of this as I type my review out."
""

"Henry Street Tap Room - excellent imperial IPA on tap along with fifteen others. Great place to enjoy the warmth of Saratoga Springs on an Autumn Night. Eight dollars for flights of four; this beer moves to the top of the paddle. Above Troegs, Allagash, and North Coast."

""
""
"I welcome this beer in the Victory line up."
"O - Perfectly balanced. Really hope they keep distributing in my area. Victory has really outdone themselves with the Dirtwolf. Just the perfect DIPA"
""
""
""
"This stuff is about as good as it gets. Pale orange in color with a frothy white head. The head is a little rocky and laces beautifully on the the glass. Smells Fantastic! Big thick hops. Tangerine notes intertwined with dank, earthy almost onion notes. It works! Taste follows. Big hop punch fades into a surprisingly graceful bitterness. The malt is there to keep things going, but stays in the background. Good light but significant feel with lively carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent stuff, and easily the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had from Victory Brewing. Hop Wallop is decent, but this stuff is flat out terrific."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some earthy, herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with grapefruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a huge citrus presence that comes through especially well in the taste."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasure to try and easy to drink. Would have again."
""
""
""
"O: Never had it and find it? Buy it. Had it and love it? Buy a case of it. Done deal."
""
"Appears a warm shade of gold with some haze. The soft white head thins to a ring around the edge. Lots going on in the aroma-first peach, melon, and citrus, then pepper, grass and pine. So potent, almost seems minty. Some evidence of bready malts to balance the hoppy goodness. The flavor is a continuation of the aroma, hoppy from the tip of the tongue to the back. More citrus rind, some grapefruit pith, and the finish leaves you with a trace of caramel. Big, fruity, and earthy and it begs you to drink up in spite of the abv, which could be ignored if you weren't careful. Well done! Nice addition to the Victory lineup."
""
"O - I really liked this one as a change on takes of beer. Yes it is dipa but there was a bit more going on showcasing the hops than your average beer. Lately I have had so many that are focused on packing as much hops as possible where this one really has some character."
""
""
""
"cheers"

"On tap at kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Slightly off white head, moderate retention on a very slightly hazy gold body with a touch of copper. Sticky, resinous, oily lacing. Aroma dominated by tropical fruit and pine. Mainly mango, tangerine, grapefruit. Damn. Taste is bitter and tongue coating. Slight malt sweetness in the background but beautifully dominated by the bitter, juicy hop bite. Very dangerously drinkable and really delicious."

"smells like citrus, biscuits, bread. citrus is mostly tangerine and orange. taste follows, although with a substantial amount of rind-type bitterness. a very good DIPA with lots of flavor, which is what beer is supposed to be about, right? not just a slam of hops...."

""

"Draught @ CBH: This one pours a clear, golden color. There was about a finger of foamy white head. It lingers a bit and leaves some lacing. An interesting nose. A big wallop of hops, but they tend to blend together. Some pine on top of the others. The taste is good. It has a good bitterness, but the taste is a bit unusual. The various hops blend together into a distinctive bitterness, without having any one specific aroma on top. Maybe a hint of pineapple coming through. The malts are hidden. Definitely dry. Interesting. It definitely grows on you."

"Low B"
""
""
""
""
"O - A great addition to the DIPA series from Victory and a must buy. The freshness on the Taste makes this a top DIPA to try in any form you can find it."
""
"This is a supremely well put together beer, and for Victory to just nail the DIPA category like this shows what they are capable of when they want to create something new. I am a fan of theirs in general, and this may be one of my favorites that they have come out with. One problem is the alcohol content, I couldn't drink many of these in a sitting. One is plenty! But if it is ever on tap somewhere, I know what my one beer for the night will be. Very solid example of the style for a very decent price too!"

"A very tasty, easy drinking DIPA that hides its nearly 9% abv well. I thought the body was a little thin, but the flavor and aroma held up to the last drop."
""
""
"*** Reviewed after trying a few Hill Farmstead product which may be slightly unfair. Clearly cannot compete in same league. Will amend review if required on next try."
""
""
""

"OVERALL: This is one of the best IPAs I've ever tasted. Deserves all the hype and certainly worthy of """world class""". Well done, Victory. Beer snobs who say this isn't on par with Pliny or Heady Topper are just too smug to admit otherwise."
"Excellent beer and should be tasted fresh."
""
"O- I see why everyone's so gung-ho about this IPA. Its delivery is assertive but has enough balance to allow a steady drinkability. However, it just does not do it for me as much as the Hop Ranch masterpiece Victory has concocted. To each their own though, as this is certainly tasty enough."

"O - An excellent DIPA from Victory. Definitely the best beer that I have had from them. A great amount of hops and very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."

"O - Victory hit it out of the park with this one. A very good and well balanced DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""

"I like it, this DIPA is full of the dank pine and citrus aroma and flavor from the hops and less focused on punishing you for it with overwhelming alcohol or bitterness. Dirtwolf has it where it counts, solid beer."
""
"Taste starts with tangerine, grapefruit, and pineapple, moves on to bread and pine, with a dank hop finish. Has a just below average mouthfeel and just above average carbonation."
""
""
""

"Very good beer, recommended to all BA's. Glad I finally found it in SD."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/10/2014. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, floral, grass, pine, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, pineapple, peach, pine resin, floral, grass, light honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Large amount of pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest/rind, pineapple, peach, pine resin, floral, grass, light bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; with a great crisp bitterness/malt balance that never gets cloying. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane DIPA! Awesome complexity and balance of hop flavors with moderate malts; and very crisp and dangerously drinkable for the ABV. An incredible offering all around."
""
"O: wow. worth the wait and search. Solid DIPA, even if the color, at first, said BORING, the smell, taste and mouthfeel delivered a solid punch of flavor, bitterness and dryness. Very smoot and good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of tropical fruits, a bit of pine. Taste is bold, bitter, fruits, some pine, a hint of malts, lots of flavor here. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a beer worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"DirtWolf is, I don't like using this word much because I feel like it's used way too damn often, pretty amazing, especially when taking into account the ABV of this thing. 8.7%, and I doubt anybody would guess that in a blind tasting. Outstanding floral and tropical notes, a not-too bitter finish, and just an overall incredible experience. This is one of the very best IIPAs I have ever had. I am thankful that this beer is not only in Michigan, but YEAR ROUND."
"O: A really good DIPA. Coming off the aroma, the taste was a bit of a letdown. Was expecting a bigger citrus punch. Was thrown off by the watery finish. All that being said, this will be one that I will revisit often."
""
"Doesn't quite live up to some of the ridiculous hype I've seen for this beer, but I can't complain. This is still one of the best DIPAs I have had."
""
"O: Very good. I don't know if I've liked anything I've had from Victory as much as I've liked this. This isn't really anything super special, but it's a great option if you're looking for a DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall- Was not quite as good as I hoped but for the price its excellent. I still love hop wallop but I do like this better, and I can see why they switched. I am pumped this is year round, and it will likely become a go to DIPA."

"I have to give Dirt Wolf a 5, seeing as how it's the best IPA I've ever had. Hops are nice and floral, giving a beautiful, sweet finish. A touch of grassiness to ease up on the floral. None of those unctuous, gasoline-y bottom notes. A lovely, lovely IPA. And I typically don't like IPAs ..."

"Pours deep yellow/soft orange with a pronounced chill haze. Huge pineapple and mango characters on the nose with elements of very dank marijuana. Pronounced hop bitterness at the front of the tongue is quickly balanced by more fresh tropical fruit flavors. Taste ends """wet""" with more deep, classic west coast flavors and slight warming. Extremely delicious."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle $2.79. Thank God I bought a single. Bright yellow orange, good head and lace. Aroma is really thick and earthy hops but then a strong plastic aroma. Flavor is astringent alcohol and plastic notes. Not really a pleasant beer at all, would not purchase."

""
""
"O: Not what I was expecting from all the word of mouth and rating, but I will give it another chance later. Good, but it lacks in mouthfeel and real body."
""
"Overall I was skeptical at first with the smell but I will be damned it turned into one of the smoothest DIPA's I had in a while. Some may argue it doesn't carry a massive hop bite other want to taste the kick of the high volume. I find perfect balance is worthy of praise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: DirtWolf represents what is the next in a long line of similar tasting IPAs from many different breweries and as a hop-head who particularly enjoys west coast IPAs, that's just fine by me. Unfortunately it also means that DirtWolf is probably at its prime for only a month or so before it becomes ignored by anyone who knows how to read a bottling/enjoy by date. Get it while it's fresh, the price is very reasonable. Would I drink it again? Yes, I imagine it would be really good on-tap."

"Overall impression: A very drinkable, assertively hoppy IPA. Sorry, it's just not in the double category for me. It is in the ballpark with Columbus Brewing and Fat Head's IPA but I just can't see it as a double."
"O: Victory for Victory yet again: this is a fantastic DIPA. I could see myself getting much more acquainted with this beer in the next few months."
"Overall- I have to say I had low expectations due to all the hype I have been hearing about this beer, but I have to say it lives up to the height. A very solid beer, it has everything you look for in a DIPA. A little on the sweet side but a damn tasty beer that I will definitely be revisiting."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent DIPA that drinks on the lighter side of the DIPA spectrum. Here's hoping they add this to their rotation full-time."
"Tangerine orange color, clean and clear, and a small white foam pile on top. Aroma is a juice party. Lemon, orange, passionfruit, pine, melon, lime, apple....pizza dough. Just the right amount of sweetness. Taste is big business. Also quite juicy with an array of fruity flavors and a solid bitter punch. Big piney tropical concoction... Mouthfeel is...yes....juicy. Juicy, dry, and a wee bit chalky. Citrus rind bitterness lingers in the mouth urging you to take another sip of happiness."
"O - Note to self - I must get this again. This is a solid DIPA - must try."
"O- Overall I enjoyed this beer and it lived up to some of the hype. This is up there in a regular DIPA I would keep around."

"Pours a mildly hazy golden yellow color. Some fine particles suspended in the body. Nice thin off-white head. Leaves very nice reaches of lace. Good, bigger citrusy, lightly piney aroma. Grassy, citrusy, piney hop in the flavor, some bready, biscuity malt. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, crisp lighter carbonation, lightly soft texture, more dry finish. Easy to sip. Good long, hoppy aftertaste, a nice crest on the hoppy wave as it rolls through the finish. Bigger bitter taste, light sweet towards the end."

"Really psyched on this beer. The hop flavor is different enough from the more common hop bombs of today and somehow it captures a unique melon/canteloupe flavor with floral and citrus fruits. It all comes together very well."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazed pale orange color with a low, creamy head that quickly settles to a bubbly cap. Aroma is heavy on the fruit...melon, grapefruit, and tangerine with underlying pine resin and a floral pungency. Heavy, ripe, oily fruit in the flavor. The focus seems to be more on a melon-like greenness and big time pineapple rather than citrus. Medium bodied with an oily slickness and a fairly tame bitterness for what it is. Pretty sticky - not overly sweet, but I`m not sure I could have more than one without it wearing on my palate a bit. Good stuff, especially if you like a more new-school fruity type DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Like a number of their other beers, this DIPA from Victory hits all the right notes while still retaining a moderately unique character—and yet it still feels just a little conservative in almost every regard. It’s like every part of it is outstanding, but set at Level 9 instead of 11. That said, this is a fantastic new DIPA, and it’s great to see Victory take a new swing at a hypercompetitive style and show that they nail it just as easily as they do their long-time standbys. Great beer and a greate value—seek it out."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is smooth, yet still has the crisp feel with a little carbonation bite at the end. Medium bodied, nothing overwhelming or out of the ordinary here. Overall, this is a great brew, and something that is a wonderful year-round option if found fresh. There are better brews available for this style, but this isn't something to pass on if you're looking for a great DIPA."
""
"Overall: a refreshing and satisfying beer. Not a quick drinking beer, but the flavors keep you interested from the start to finish. Super beer."

"Bottom Line: Great brew!"
"According to the guidelines of the """IPA's as Nick Cave Recordings""" system, DirtWolf simply never aspires to anything that could justify 'The Firstborn is Dead' or 'Let Love In' designations -- it just isn't a landmark for the style nor is it decade defining. The argument for a 'Kicking Against the Pricks' designation is a sound one, maybe even an altogether reasonable one (the large extent of its substance being already explored and the debate of preferences being, somewhat moreso than others, subjective). However, with its poignant aggressiveness and general lack of risks noted alongside its immediate (and, at times, deserved) acclaim, I'm going to go ahead, follow my heart, and give it a solid 'Murder Ballads'."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol is wide open and outfront with lots of depth of hoppy characteristics. This is a bold display of simcoe all around and it really works and is balanced as far as dipas go. The bitterness persists long after the swallow and the alcohol bite seems much more intense than you might imagine for the listed level. Thanks again Matt, I appreciate the chance to try this."

"Overall: A very good West Coast style IPA. Very good juicy taste of citrus fruits with some good earthy notes."
""
"Pours a nice medium gold color. Mildly hazy. The head is small to medium and just a bit off white. Good retention, a bit of lacing. The aroma is sugary lemons, white grape juice, honeysuckle, grapefruit, peach, peppercorn, pineapple and pine. Lots of bright hops. Nice and juicy. Not much malt to be found, except a little sweetness in the background. The taste is similar. Lots of hops, sweet and full of flavor. Citrus, stone fruit, some pine and a bit of tropical fruit. Mildly dry. Mouthfeel is relatively light, smooth, carbonation is a bit lower than normal. Very good DIPA and a surprising flavor to come out of Victory. It's much closer to an Alpine DIPA than anything that I'd expect from them. Excellent work."

"O: This is a really solid DIPA. My favorite? Not quite: the slight booziness is really the only thing keeping this from being elite. Still, I really like all of the berry flavors emanating from this. I can't decide if this is better than Hop Wallop or not, though - there's a definite resemblance, but I think I'd take the delicate grapefruit of Hop Wallop over the berry goodness of this, if only slightly."

"Overall: absolutely great DIPA, I found a diamond in the rough today while shopping around for beers and this one delivered. It is not like Vicory's Hop Wallop which I find more caramelly, more built for those who want the hard bitter feel. Roughly 10 to 12 bucks for a 4-pack...I consider it money well spent. Salud!"

"O- Victory has created an awesome IIPA. Four packs of this goes for only $7.99 which is a killer price. I had quite high expectations for this beer, and Victory truly delivered."

"If a brewery other than Victory made this, people would probably score it lower."
"Overall - Pretty good. This is victory's take on a west coast style dipa. If it wasn't for the alcohol, this would be one super smooth, easy drinking beer, but to me, the alcohol is too present and overpowers the nice, smooth tropical fruits. Good beer though and a welcomed addition to the victory lineup."
"I would agree with other reviewers that this beer is for Victory an excellent step in the West Coast IPA direction. It is not a beer that holds up to the standards I desire of the few excellent west coast beers available on the east coast such as Firestone or Green Flash. The initial smell is not of grapefruit and the taste is not as hoppy and bitter as my very narrow palate desires. I can understand when a brewer does not want to go more extreme in order to sell more product. I think this is a nice compromise for a product that I would drink again but do not dream about while finishing another shift at work!"
"Overall- great double ipa. Not the biggest double ipa fan bbut would ddefinitely buy this again."

"Pale slightly hazed golden body with a bright white head forms thick and even with speckled lacing the hops are packed into this DIPA served in 8.99 four packs. Aroma has citrus, earthy layers of hops fresh off the vine it's a green fresh hop experience in a year round offering, it's crazy. Flavor wise it explodes with hop bitterness bringing you to the edge of comfort on the palate with insane herbal, citrus, tropical fruit hop bitterness. I'm in love, and it's way too drinkable at that. No freshness dates on the bottle, you have to check this beer out it's packed with loads of whole leaf hops bringing a DIPA from Victory to another level. Candied citric hops ride the flavor out not too sweet finishes more balanced than most hoppy offerings but doesn't kill the palate and hop head experience with malt sweetness. An enjoyable beer to be had by all, especially those beer drinker's who are craving hops. It's my third bottle and the hops just keep getting more and more addicting, this is the type of DIPA that is going to sell out in cases, smooth carbonation oily slick mouthfeel medium to light bodied goes down without any effort. Great beer I'm glad this is going to be available year round, big step for Victory Brewing."

"O - Outstanding Double IPA, I like Hop Wallop, but it was packed with a lot of bitterness, where this is a great balance of bitterness, flavor, malt and sweetness, and goes down excellent. New year-round double IPA? I think so."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- great beer i love it, not to compare but it seems to have the hop profile of a heady topper, and thats alright by me. Just a great DIPA tons of sweetness and citrus at great price as well. Not the biggest Victory fan, but that may be all changing."

"Having this next to Hop Ranch, this is just as good, but very different. For those into light malt bodies, light citrus and tropical (less so than Hop Ranch), but also strong pine and dankness."
"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and very nice example of the style, it really highlights the tropical fruit and citrus hops nicely while not being overly bitter and being pretty drinkable and refreshing. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these without getting bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was great, it wasn't too better and it really showcased the kind of hops I love. What I liked the least about this beer was the carbonation, it wasn't bad but I thought it could be toned down just a little. I would for sure buy this beer again, I may have to pick up a four pack next time I'm at the store. I would recommend this to anyone who loves hoppy beers. All in all I'm a little impressed with this beer, it came pretty close to being as good as I had heard it was and while it's not my favorite of the style, it's still a damn good beer. I thought Hop Wallop was a good beer, but I think this one is better and I don't think I'll be missing Hop Wallop anytime soon, so far DirtWolf is my favorite beer from Victory.. Great job Victory, I've been overlooking this brewery a little but they sure got my attention now, keep up the great work guys."

"I've read a ton of reviews calling this """west coast style"""... it isn't. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice DIPA, but it has its own twist to it. I'll certainly grab more."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a smallish fluffy white head that persists for a good long time. Aromas of pine and resin with bits of tropical fruit and citrus. Very faint bready malt deep in the background. The flavor starts with a light sweet bread malt back bone. Assault by hops starts with some dank resinous pine and follows with tropical and citrus fruits. A touch of alcohol pops in before a lingering dank resinous bitterness lingers on the palette long after each sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and slick resinous bitter mouthfeel. Great double IPA, big bold and aggressive."
""

""
""
"Pours a dark gold with a light head. Aroma of grapefruit and tropical citrus. In the taste, grapefruit, pith, pineapple and herb. Nice fruity tropical notes and a peach skin like note. Solid bitterness and just a hint of alcohol. Medium bodied, well carbonated and slightly dry. Overall, this is a great west coast style IPA."

"Bottle from Gator Beverage. Pours a lemony gold color, slight haze, and with a big frothy white head that keeps on going. Very floral aroma, the hops are dank and earthy with some hints of citrus juice. Flavor follows with lemony pine flavor, good bitter but not overwhelmingly so, and with a solid malt backbone giving this a nice sweetness to support the hops. Medium to lowish carbonation for the style, slick, but still feels light enough on the palate. This one gets lighter as I go, and is dangerously drinkable. While I would prefer other DIPAs out there, this one has drinkability of a 6% brew. That makes this very nice."
""
"Single finger thick head with excellent lacing on a slightly hazy bright and deep golden body. Aroma has a lot of musty and earthy hop presence with some pale malts and vinegar. Flavor follows with more of a bready malt base and more earthy and piney hops. Only a hint if tart citrus throughout. Medium body and moderate carbonation, a little oily. The name having dirt in it is right for the earthiness. It's good but not as good as some people are aaying for my tastes. Too me it's too sour and funky."

"Unexpected surprise from Victory on DirtWolf, which is a solid IIPA, though a touch hot, it has a lot of good qualities and is solidly hop forward. Worth trying if you love hops in your face."

"Personally, a done deal by Victory. A tremendous DIPA with sticky sweet hops and a balance of bitterness. This IS different from hop wallop, I don't care who you are! HW has that crazy bitterness and hop explosion. .. DW is literally a come up from the ground mouthfeel of earthy and citrus hops(get it? Up from the ground, DirtWolf!) Overall, a definite """must have""" for all BA's!"

"12 ounce bottle, best by Mar 09 2014. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) and pine hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some spicy hops and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good double IPA, I liked it. $9.99 a 4-pack."

"This is an awesome DIPA. Definitely the best one I've had from Victory. It's nothing like their other hoppy beers and it doesn't have their signature """house flavor""". This will make a great addition to their year-round line up. Great execution and well crafted. Recommended."
""

"Glad this has finally made its way to the northern va area having heard lots of good things. This certainly did not disappoint and all the positive reviews are well vindicated. It pours a clear straw gold colour with a white fluffy head. Aroma is wonderful, a real citrus bomb with a blast tropical notes. The taste follows suit, the citra hop dominates with tropical notes of peach, mango, and papaya. The other hop varietals bring good balance and flavour, and while citrus remains at the core, but there is some grassiness and spiciness that keeps things interesting. The bitterness is present, and whilst hoppy, isn't overpowering and supported by a modest malt bill. This beer is extremely smooth and the alcohol impressively well hidden making it dangerously drinkable. All in all, Victory have done a great job here in producing an excellent ipa that stands out in a very saturated market. It is also an impressive departure from Hop Wallop, which despite being a decent brew, is left in the dust by this. I expect as distribution continues to widen people will remain impressed by this beer, and at $10 a four pack, it is very accessible. Highly recommended!"

"Had this beer easily half a dozen times now and my opinion never varies. One of the best DIPAs I've had and one of the easiest and most fun beers at 8.7% to drink. Superb stuff."

"Overall: I really didn't think that Victory had this in them. I really love the brewery, but it is more due to their German and Belgian beers than purely hoppy brews. I was wrong as this is near perfect for the style."

"Poured into a New Belgium globe glass. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a 2 finger head and decent lacing. The smell is of citrus and tropical fruit with malt in the background. The taste matches the nose, with tropical fruits, citrus and a hint of pine with malts coming through last. This is a big and well balanced beer, with the alcohol well disguised. It's a worthy challenger to the best of the best."

"O- very good 2IPA with a great hop profile"
""
""

"O - Very enjoyable and will definitely look for it again. It goes down very easily."
"Overall, I really like the hop profile. It's just a bit watery up front washing out some of the flavor - which keeps it from being outstanding."

"O- one of the most surprising beers I have ever had, ever. I had no expectations but once I tried this I was blown away, amazing west coast style double. The balance is amazing and the consistency is dangerously drinkable. At the price, you can not pass this beer up, go buy it now! A beer this good, should not be this easy to buy."
""
"O: This is a interesting and wondeful DIPA. Hits the full spectrum of hop flavors, not just a tropical citrus bomb like the in vogue IPAs of today. It must be the Mosaic hops that give it an interesting/new flavor to me. Must try for Hop heads, wonderful beer for the price. Has a great nose. More interesting than Hop Wallop, will buy again."
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a two finger frothy head. Decent lacing. The aroma is citrus, tropical fruit, and resinous pine. Bitterness from start to finish on the palate. Flavor follows the nose - tropical fruit and citrus, with pine resin, floral and spicy notes on the back end. Great malt backbone, just enough to balance the massive hop assault. Finishes dry. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, an outstanding Imperial IPA from Victory."

"o: Excellent beer, outstanding addition for a new every day beer(wish it came in 12, or 6.packs)."

"Overall, I feel this had great potential, and I like it, but it comes close to being fantastic without quite getting there. It's pleasantly dry, but ultimately I wish it tasted juicier because it hints at being so. Still glad Victory is putting this out and I'll still pick it up every now and then."
"Enjoy by date is nearly impossible to read, but it's from last week's delivery, and has to be October, November, or December, so this is pretty fresh."
""
""
"O - While I'm not lauding this as the best DIPA of the year as some people are, it's a very good representation of the style. Lot's of great hop flavor and seemingly more malt flavor than most DIPA's. It won't overtake Heady Topper, Cafe Racer 15, SN Hoptimum or Ruination on my list of favorite DIPA's, but I really enjoyed this beer, and will purchase again."
""
""
"O - Victory really surprised me with this one (hell, I think it surprised the whole BA community). Easily makes my top 5 list of double IPAs, and that ain't an easy list to make. World class for sure. Just an explosion of bright, clean citrus and tropical fruit without bitterness overkill. I'm pretty damn stoked I live 15 minutes from the brewery right now!"

"Well done, Victory!"
""
""
"Overall: Hop bomb. Not much complexity, no balance whatsoever, and very boozy. Just because it is a double IPA doesn't mean it can't have any malt presence. That being said, I could see this beer improving after aging it for a few months to a year. Not a bad beer by any means, just not the best example of the style. Almost tastes like a poor man's Lagunitas Sucks to me. If unabashed, reckless hops in beer is your thing, give it a shot. Otherwise, seek out another DIPA with a bit more balance."

"Pours a hazy bright orange color with a finger head that goes away quickly and leaves some nice lacing. Lots of carbonation. Smells of dank pine, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, marmalade, floral, light breadiness, and some carmel. Taste is filled with tons of pine and grapefruit. Beginning brings wet pine, grapefruit, and mango. The middle brings bready malts, carmel, as well as more grapefruit and pine that is not as intense as before. The finish turns to more of a tropical fruit like papaya or guava, as well as a sweeter grapefruit and mango. Not much breadiness like before, but do get sweet carmel to somewhat balance the onslaught of hops on the finish. The resinous pine comes back and adds a west coast style dryness to the beer. Multiple hop flavors linger on the palate. High medium body with an oily and sticky mouthfeel. Get tons of juicy citrus and tropical fruits from the citra and mosaic, yet you also get lots of spicy pine and grapefruit from the simcoe and chinook. Glad this is year round."
""
""
""
"O- For all East Coast Hop Heads who love our West Coast IPA/DIPA, this is a must try. The appearance, smell, taste and mouthful is all West Coast style, but brewed in our backyard of the Philly suburbs. At $40 per case, this is a home run in taste, price and availability. Enjoy!"
""
"O: a really nice DIPA, leaning more toward an IPA in feel and flavor, but with a little bit of extra weight and substance to make sure you know what you're drinking - subtle and assertive at the same time. A well-crafted and thoroughly enjoyable beer."

""
""
"Overall, it's easy drinking, looks good and tastes good. What more could you ask for."

"I was honestly mildly saddened to see hop wallop go, but when you consider that it was replaced with DirtWolf, it dosent seem so bad anymore. First off this brew has a fantastic smell of citrus and mild earthy hops- smells very much like many west coast citraesque beers. I wouldn't call this a one sided or lopsided hoppy brew, but the hops come forth with an a vengeance and stay with you. The malt backbone is there but it in no way takes away from the hoppy nature of the brew. I personally love this quality of DirtWolf as I am not so much into malt taking away from the hop presence in many DIPAS. This is easily in my new top 10 DIPAS and I will certainly buy more. The only downside is that it comes in a 4 pack! I am able to bet Heady on a weekly basis so this is a great rival and slightly less expensive. I strongly recommend this brew to all who desire a hop forward DIPA where the malt takes a back seat as it should!"
"Overall, I'm very impressed with this beer. It outdoes Hop Wallop in every way, and it's awesome to have a great fruit-forward DIPA that I'll be able to find year-round, and relatively fresh as well. Awesome!"

"Overall – This was a wonderful hopped double IPA. Tons of nice citrus in the tangerine and the huge ruby red grapefruit with other nice hop flavors complimenting and a nice creamy taste to boot. This is a very nice brew."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its drinkability, but this didn’t come too far after its bright aroma and flavoring. Our first thought when sniffing back on this guy was “Heady Topper”. It seems like, across most aspects of the beer, they were attempting to mimic that exact profile, with bright and tropical fruitiness, clean malts, and insanely juicy, but invitingly clean hops. To compare to Hop Wallop, the beer that Dirtwolf (I keep thinking, saying, and typing “Direwolf”…can’t shake it for some reason!!) is replacing, it is very different. The former attempts much more to knock you to the ground with as big a hop bitterness as they can muster, whereas here, the goal appears to be cleanliness of blend and form, drinkability, and more delicate (but explosive) hops inclusions. Either way this is a welcomed beer, and Victory really nailed this one. While this may not be the most “original” DIPA, this will easily become a fridge regular as it’s got just the right blend that makes beers like this so approachable, with a consistent experience that is reproducible every time."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with dense white cap,  nice lacing for the first couple of inches.  Smell:  pine, honey,  biscuit, floral, mild citrus.  Taste:  boozy pineapple,  grapefruit, sweet,   white grape, lightly bready.  Different hopping but reminds of the unfortunately """east coasty""" DIPA  it replaced.  Fluffy carb,  medium  plus bodied.  It's  nice but Victory still  doesn't distribute an  ipa that wows me."
"A very bitter beer--upfront and throughout the tasting. Decent body with a good level of carbonation. Lots of harsh bitterness with a good dollop of alcohol. Very little malt taste."
""

"Poured into a pint glass, great color, aroma, and lacing. Very smooth beer that flows down your throat with great ease. Really impressed with the smell, I wish I could get a cologne that smells that good. One of the best DIPA's I've had. Overall a very nectar beer."

"but you will feel it"

"I read some reviews that said it was basically re-branded Hop Wallop. I totally disagree with this! It's quite different, but still sooo friggin' good!!! Thanks Victory!"
""
"Overall....this beer confused the shit out of me. I got this huge burst of citrus in the nose, amazingly fragrant beer there is no argument there at all....but after the first sip I had to look to make sure it was the same beer...the nose on this was completely misleading( to me at least) don't get me wrong there are still notes of citrus while drinking..but the dominant flavors are pine and almost a cilantro - perfume type deal... very interesting ... this is an awesome beer to check out....and it is not bad by any means, more like some thing your not going to expect at all after smelling it."
"Overall - I'm not surprised by how good this beer is, because I've come to expect greatness from Victory; but the fact that they've stepped away from their usual style and managed to make a WC style IPA this good...very impressive!!!"

"O: this is a borderline world class dipa. Hats off to victory on their new brew it's a winner and better than hop wallop. I may have found a new go to ipa. Oh and bonus points for the great price (7.99 a 4-pack around me)"
""
"Not much else to say besides gushing praise. Excellent, excellent beer. Tons of depth, deeep hop flavor, malt that's good enough to be the star of the beer on its own, great mouthfeel, huge aroma. Easily the best new widely distributed beer I've had in a long time."

"This is one delicious DIPA and thanks go out to Trent again for sending it my way. A top notch example of the style."
"Poured into a 13 tulip before March 24, 2014. Pours a straw yellow, with a fluffy one inch white head with excellent retention and coats the glass with thick lacing. Smell is loads of tropical fruit mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, fresh cut grass, and grapefruit. Taste is at first tropical, with punch of grapefruit and a touch of lemon in the finish, it really leaves its mark on the tongue, I like it myself. Medium body, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. Excellent will have this in my fridge often. Much more than Wallup, sorry but rest in peace Hop Wallup. This is like someone took a Heady Topper and a third of a bottle of Ruination in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell, taste, and appearance are very good for this beer. This is one of the better Victory beers. What I do not like is that the taste is present for a second or two, then it is all alcohol burn. I believe if they can mask the alcohol better, it could truly become a quality brew."
"O: This beer will make you forget that Hop Wallop ever existed. Phenomenal in all respects, a very clean and focused Double IPA. This is the type of beer Hop-heads pray for every night. Dirt Wolf is on the short list of best IPA/DIPAs I've had all year."
""
""
"With DirtWolf, Victory has finally catapulted themselves into the arena of spectacular DIPAs, up there with The Plinys, Hopslam, Brown Sugar, Heady Topper and the like. The throne may not be far away. Beware the howl!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an amazing beer, entirely unexpected yet I'm not surprised. Excellent offering."
"O - Victory has successfully crafted a West Coast style DIPA. Huge aromas and flavors of tropical fruits accompanied by an aggressive bitter pine hop finish. I liked Hop Wallop, but this is a welcomed replacement. I don't like the move to 4-packs, although Victory was previously the exception, not the rule with their 6 packs. I will be getting this beer regularly. I suggest you do the same."
"Overall: Honestly, I had no idea what to expect coming into this beer. I was excited to try something new from Victory and boy, I wasn't disappointed. The fruity like flavors and outstanding hops were the first to originally grab me. Went down quite nice too. This is a beer I can see myself having again....and again thanks to Victory. Definitely going to have to try this on tap next time I get the chance. I would and will totally recommend this to a friend. Cheers!"

"DirtWolf is a superbly balanced DIPA that excels on all fronts. Fruity and floral, with an enticing aroma followed by lovely bittersweet citrus. Very close in flavor profile Bell's The Oracle (a hard to find favorite) and available year round. Well worth seeking out, this beer will not disappoint."

"This is the best beer Victory has created in over 5 years (almost taking the title away from WildDevil for me). If this beer matched WildDevil's exquisite mouthfeel, I would declare this the best beer they have ever produced. Still, this is a borderline world-class IIPA. The fact that I will be able to easily obtain this almost anywhere will spoil me. I may no longer feel the need to go out of my way to obtain the slightly better but much rarer IIPA's on the market anymore. Bravo, Victory!"

"Pretty damn perfect"

"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent amber color with an inch of frothy head. Some lacing. The aroma is citrus and tropical fruits with some piney hops notes. Orange, mango, pineapple and grapefruit. The taste is bitter tropical fruits with citrus as well. Some floral and spicy hops towards the finish. Decent amount of malt flavor but this one is certainly hop forward. Bitter grapefruit peel at the end. Mouthfeel is creamy yet oily with lots of carbonation. Overall, an impressive offering from Victory. I'll be buying this again."

"O: For the price and availability, this is one of the best IIPAs on the market."
"this beer is basically the recipe to Enjoy By (9.13.13) but in four packs from Victory. the only differences would be a little more pine on the back end which i do love. isn't necessarily the most memorable, but at about $10 for a four pack i'd choose this over Enjoy By any day. alcohol is pretty much hidden completely, save for the end of the brew there is a little bite. Overall solid beer, but i felt this was an opportunity to do something different that wasn't taken."

"Overall - DirtWolf might be my favorite readily available DIPA. I'm not a """hop head""" but I could down these. Alcohol is well hidden."

"The perfume on this beer is intense and the drink itself is cultivated. It warms slightly in the dry finish but there is nary a trace of alcohol except for that. The mouthfeel is unbroken by anything harsh or unpolished. I'll have another."

"Overall: I like this beer, and I think I liked it even more when I had it freshly squeezed about a week after it was bottled. With my second bottle, drank for the purposes of this review two weeks later, I want to say that the hop character has faded a bit already. I may be imagining that. Nonetheless, I want a little bit more sour, a little bit more citrus, or a little bit more sweet. The flavors are there, but I wish they were more forward and a little more complex."

"D - A wonderful addition to Victory line-up... I'll miss Hop Wallop, but not for long... This is more than adequate replacement and to be honest, it's a far superior offering... The near 9% ABV is rather well hidden... Even and consistent... A very nice highly refreshing offering... Now if we could just do something about that name..."

" The flavor is incredible. I expcected good things, but damn, this is phenomenal the lovely citrus and tropical graprefruity flavors are fresh and vibrant without a ton of bitterness and the flavor of the malt is low with the hops up front and some very low pepper in the back end. The flavor has a valencia orange flavor which considering the 'enjoy by February 5, 2014""" ...Overall this is pretty fresh and tasty -as an Imperial IPA should be - I am looking forward to having this again, it exceeds expectations at least for me lots of hop flavor without a lot of alcohol flavor or excess malt to intrude - well Done Victory!"

"Overall: So glad they have distribution to NJ cause this is gonna be my go to double for a long time. Can't complain at $2 a bottle for a 4 pack."

"Golden yellow in color and hazy, with a very faint amber hue in the middle. Poured with a healthy, rich, white foam that slowly reduced to a soapy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aromas are dominant with malty sweetness just barely eking through beneath. An incredible aroma. Medium bodied with even, refreshing carbonation throughout and tangy, dry finish. Pungent citrus hop bitterness arrests the taste buds at first with a tangy bite. Fresh tangerine and grapefruit flavors through the middle almost as if you’ve just taken a bite of either one. Malts characters are allowed some attention from the middle to the end. Finishes with a citrusy, bitter hoppiness that is accentuated by the crisp dry feel. A touch of booziness creeps in as this warms. I’m a big fan of Victory and even this exceeded expectation."
"O: Great beer. I'd rock this again and twice on Sundays. It's not a palate wrecker like a west-coast DIPA, it's very much east coast. It's got hop, but you can still drink something else (hoppy or big and dark) afterward."
"Overall a good solid dipa and unique tasting one. Earth shatering, not exactly, but worthy and delicious all its own."

"OV: A very good DIPA. Pros for me were the dry finish, the easy drinkability and the harmonious balance between the malt and hops. Cons were the body and that the flavour lacked all the aspects in the aroma. This goes down too easy for a DIPA."

"This beer reminded me VERY much of stone enjoy by 9.13.13. Color was a little more golden pale than anticipated. A little more malt sweetness than that of the enjoy by. Definitely a pretty big citrus bomb with almost a peach/tropical hint to it. Perfect balance of sweet to bitter as nothing took over the other. Incredibly smooth mouthful and drinkability. Couldn't even detect the alcohol. Actually liked this beer better than the enjoy by and is easily in the top 5 dipas that I've ever had. Victory nailed this one. Probably won't reach status of heady or Pliny (probably due mainly to how available it will be so there isn't the rarity factor) but if you're looking for a citrus forward dipa, this would be tops on many list. Factor in price point ($2 a bottle locally) and you won't find a better dipa out there for the price (and probably worth twice...no, no actually it sucks cause I don't want the price to go up)."

"O- A great DIPA. I am mad at myself right now for only buying one bottle, I will be pick up at least a 4-pack tomorrow. I except good beer from Victory and this excessed my exceptions."

"I wwas really happy with Victory’s Ranch series but this takes it to another level. I think the addition of the Citra elevates it to a whole new level. I may be blinded by the novelty of a new DIPA but (at least for now) I can say this is one of the best examples of the style I’ve ever had."
"I think this is the new it beer from Victory. Crazy hoppy and a damn good replacement for hop wallop."

"O: This one will definitely sneak up on you. Doesn't seem anywhere near 8.7%, so watch out for that. Quite the citrus and stone fruit bomb. Decently easy to drink, so luckily it's only in 4-packs. Highly recommended"
""
""
"Overall: Nice new DIPA from Victory. Earthier and spicier than Hop Wallop was, I will have to grab another one of these and do a side by side with one of the (admittedly old at this point) bottles of Hop Wallop I've got in my basement."
""
"Exceptional....this beer has a wonderful nose of fresh picked hops. The mouthfeel is good, and the first sip brings a buffet of fresh, sweaty, grapefruit hop bitterness. The flavor finishes out with a malty sweetness. There is virtually no sign of the 8.7% abv. This beer is exceptional...believe the hype! I could say more but I'd rather take another long sip..."

"Had a growler filled at Premier Gourmet this weekend....I love that place.Poured into an impy nonic a clear light to medium golden with a great looking blooming white head that left two multiple rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Pine and grapefruit along with sugary sweetness in the nose,there is drunken fruit element to it.Fresh citric hops greet the taste buds that melds into a grassiness and then into a sweet dough caramel base,a sugary alcohol element is there but doesn't overpower the hops.I like it,top 5....not sure,but it kicks ass."

"The high level of craftsmanship really shines through with this beer. I just don't care for the flavor-it tastes like cat piss. I will say though that it is well balanced for a DIPA, much moreso than say Weyerbacher Double Simcoe (another beer that I get a strong cat piss flavor from). The beer has a nice fluffy head that lingers and lots of lacing. Very aromatic. I don't get any citrus or tropical flavors at all, it's just straight up cat piss for me. It's a fine beer and many will love this, just not for me."

"Overall: outstanding beer. Reminds me of a lagunitas Maximus with a focus on the citrus favors. Excellent beer."

"Can i just start by saying, WOW! I haven't reviewed in a while but this one deserves a review. I had a Pliny the Elder yesterday, so my tongue knows a good IPA right now. And this one has a huge tropical nose. I could smell it as soon as I opened the bottle. Tropical fruit and dankness. The mouth feel is extremely similar to Pliny, it has the smooth roundness and fizz just around the edge of your tongue that makes it refreshing and bountiful at the same time. There are waves of flavor starting with the tropical fruit, pineapple and mango, pouring into the green dank of pot and lemongrass, dropping right into a bitter cherry and round biscuit crispness. I know crisp and round? I don't get it either, but there it was. It lingers for a long while then cuts out abruptly. For my money and hopefully availability, this is one of the best DIPA's on the market. This stuff knocks Lunch off the shelf."
"O: Peace out Hop-Wallop. This new DIPA is the real deal. Excellent job Victory!"
""
"Can this beer, should this beer be replacing Hop Wallop? Damn right it should, this is a winner of a beer that is deserving of Victory's new DIPA replacement. Well done, I'll be drinking lots of this beer, guaranteed."

"O-good DIPA, nice hoppy flavor"
"Overall - Wonderful DIPA. Very drinkable."
