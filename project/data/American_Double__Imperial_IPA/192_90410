It's lacking body, though. Again, not a bad beer. Just slightly off, in my opinion.","do_ob","Wednesday at 05:24 PM"

It appears that way because this is an excellent IPA that I would put right up there with the Torpedo and Stone IPA. Hits all the right notes that a west coast IPA should. Nothing special to look at, but aroma and taste offer plenty of resinous pine notes with hints of biting citrus. Just a hint of balancing malt sweetness. Body is on the light side of medium, with crisp lively carbonation and a clean dry finish. Add the fact that I can find this easily for $8.99/6 pack and it's clear there will be a lot of this in my fridge this summer.","glass_house","Mar 19, 2015"

Not much head but moderate lacing throughout. Aroma of anise, juniper and maybe butterscotch. The taste is simultaneously sweet and bitter, mildly citrusy, moderately carbonated - definitely its best quality. Mouthfeel is a torrent of syrupy, boozy malt checked by a defiant melange of hops varieties with all the familiar dankness of American hops, though more prominently just bitter than floral. It lingers appropriately, as an Imperial and an IPA should. It has some of the best characteristics of an Imperial and many of the great characteristics of a hallmark American IPA. It'd be a really great Imperial IPA with some more aromatics and floral finishing hops.","mdexter","Mar 03, 2015"

New Belgium has done it again and I think Rampant is worth every penny. Just be sure to drink it from a nice glass in order to get the full experience, because the head and appearance are every bit as savory and pleasurable as the flavor itself.

Nose is light as well with a mild tropical note. Pine and light citrus. Malt brings sweet aromas. Taste does have the peach like character as well as stonefrut and a mild nuttiness. Finish is dry and short with a clean but a large hoppiness that kisses the mouth lightly with a memory of hop oil. Feel is light and supple with velvety carbonation. Super drinkable and this goes down like a session ale instead of a DIPA. A very nicely done hop showcase.","scootny","Dec 23, 2014"

Maybe not as hoppy as many top DIPAs but for the money you will spend on a 6 pack it's a deal that is hard to beat. Just make sure you get it fresh. I'm really starting to warm up to New Belgium's stuff. I love there sours and Rampant, Ranger, and Accumulation are all pretty good hoppy beers. Still not a fan of many of their non sour bomber releases though.

The overall impression is a pretty decent yet not quite exceptional Imperial IPA to me. It is a little to alcohol forward in the taste for me but better than most with more hop flavor than less as far as this style goes. It is lacking hop flavor which is what I like to see more of instead of just bitterness","Slatetank","Sep 29, 2014"

Nice copper red body, good carbonation, poured into a snifter. Presentation has a lot going for it right now, I've got it at a great temperature and its leaving a beautiful lace on my glass. Nutty and hoppy, somewhat oily, even a little vegetable (celery or onion?) like in the taste. Aftertaste has some nice malted backbone. This is solid. Good beer. That orange kick is a bit interesting, not good or bad. Some brown sugar like sweetness at the end. I like it, and would buy it again.","cambabeer","Sep 15, 2014"

3.78,0,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.75,"13 oz bottle from Tipples. Pours a beautiful golden orange color with a fluffy white one finger head. Nice floral hop aroma , bready malts, citrus peel, grass, pine. Flavor is nice bitter pine, floral notes, lightly sweet bready malts. Body is medium to light, somewhat dry, bitterness on the tongue, with medium plus carbonation. This goes down very easy. A slight dirtiness on the finish is my only complaint, and it is very strange. But an otherwise solid DIPA that’s easy to find, and nice and light for the style. Just a weird flavor here and there that I can’t put my finger on.","BMMillsy","Jul 23, 2014"

Pouring it into the glass released an immediate hop smell, which is exactly what I was looking for. I don't pout aggressively so I only got about a finger of head. It dissipated to a point, but there's about 1/4 finger worth sticking around. It is a clear golden-amber color. Lacing is great. It smells of a crap ton of hops. I'm still working out my pallet and nose, but I do pick up a hint of citrus. When drinking I taste hops, then a bit of pear (which I wouldn't have guessed unless the label said so), a tiny bit of citrus, then a piney finish. Overall I enjoyed this beer. I was craving a good IPA and this fulfilled my craving","nreed","Jul 13, 2014"

The taste is sweet and the alcohol is present, the hop bitterness kicks in a second later and lingers for a few seconds after you swallow. I wish it had a more resinous hop flavor and feel. The mouth feel is o.k. Overall, this is an o.k. DIPA, it's enjoyable but really leaves you wanting more. Definitely don't drink this after an Enjoy By or Green Flash Imperial. I don't seek this out regularly but for the price it is an excellent buy. You get a nice quality enjoyable brew from a reputable co-op company, so cheers and go America!","CCStix","Jun 15, 2014"

Flavor is obviously hop-forwarded. Hops, as in the nose, are earthy and herbal, with the NB house taste complimenting the hop character well. Malts taste of caramel and toasted bread. Mouthfeel isn't too thick. Carbonation helps to scrub up the sweetness and bitterness. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that is outside of what I normally look for in one.","goochpunch","Apr 23, 2014"

Aroma of spicy (as in winter holiday spides) piney hops, orange family citrus, bready malt, appealing. Flavor is citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, finishing with orange and lemon citrus, mild tropical fruit and piney hop bitterness. Quite nice creamy mouth feel and medium body. The hop formula leans towards European citrus and fruit flavors, with a complex mix of tropical and citrus fruit flavors and sweetish malt. Nicely balanced, interesting flavors and a very nice body.

This ale pours a hazy golden straw color with a slightly off white head. This gives way to just a slight film and decent white lacing. The aroma is nice with lots of citrus and pine notes and an underlying malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is super smooth and drinkable. With an abv like this and this sort of drinkability, this one could get you in trouble. The flavor disappoints though. Its not bad just not as fresh and hoppy as what I had on tap a few weeks back. Before I speak my final piece on this one, I want to find it on draft or at least a very fresh bottle to try because I know this beer is better than what I'm tasting right now.","lochef81","Feb 11, 2014"

I have had a lot of New Belgium's lineup over the years, which I should revisit and review at some point, alas this is the one I have at present. The color is a nice true gold, different than other DIPA's I have had as of late. It has that New Belgium smell to it, I guess its the yeast they use, but just about every one of their beers have it. Its kind of a funky sweet smell, that unlike those true Belgian Trappist and Abbey yeasts. I like New Belgium and as the person previously mentioned this is a gateway craft beer. But also one I would drink again if in a certain circumstance where it was present. I know it says peach on the bottle and someone else said it had a peachy taste, I didn't get as much as I was expecting to get. It does have a nice balance of hops and fruitiness, almost a blend of a Belgian style with an IPA, but not exactly. It is sweet and less hoppy than I would expect from a DIPA, nonetheless, it is good but not spectacular.","humuloner22","Feb 11, 2014"

Rampant features a boozy sweetness reminiscent of sautéed peaches, cooked sugar; a clean hop bitterness with herbal and grapefruit flavors. A little light on the hop aroma, and more balanced in flavor than some hophead would want. Nothing special if you're used to the very best IIPA's, but certainly not a drainpour, and worth the sale price if you can find it.","Aaron_Ramson","Jan 31, 2014"

Smells nice, a mix of citrus and vegetative hop material. Smells maybe a little rough around the edges but is pleasantly assertive without having one dominant note. Taste is much of the same if slightly less hoppy on the flavor than one might expect.

Smell is definitely floral with some nice strong hints of resin and pineapple. Taste is definitely hop forward that's less fruity and more resin. Really not very bitter. Really a great put together flavor as you get a little taste of grains to give it a tiny bit more balance than a lot of IIPAs.

3.89,2.9,4,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear golden with a thick white head and a ton of lace.. the smell is sweet fruit and faint floral hop.. the taste follows with the sweetness increasing as it warms with little alcohol coming through.. there's peach kiwi with a flower hop that more so balances the sweetness.. the mouthfeel is medium to heavy but a crispness follows through the end.. pretty good ipa but with a heavy malt/ alcohol sweetness.","DrewsBrews450","Dec 06, 2013"

Smells like lots of hops, mostly pine and earthy in character. There is a slight malty smell as well. Taste is very hop pronounced, resiny, earthy, and bitter up front. There is a mild malty sweetness throughout the taste, and the bitterness lingers through the finish which is very crisp. No discernable alcoholic taste even for an 8.5% beer. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium high carbonation, and slightly viscous. Overall this is a very good Double IPA, not nearly as extreme as some, both in terms of maltiness and hoppiness. This could pass as a Single IPA to some breweries. Will definitely have this beer again.","scvance","Nov 24, 2013"

Its actually fairly 'balanced' for a DIPA and the malts are not overly toasty, which I do not like in a hoppy beer. Mouthfeel is nice and the beer has a pretty smooth flow to it. While this is not going to blow anyone out of the water, I personally appreciate a moderately priced six pack of a DIPA and dont think there is enough of them out there. This is one that I will most likely purchase again, dating on the bottles is a huge plus for hoppy beers.","twiggamortis420","Aug 26, 2013"

While Rampant didn’t completely blow my doors off, I thought it was a very impressive and solid Double IPA. I did detect some similarities to the Super IPA, but not quite as bold and well-rounded. The light copper color immediately gave off a wonderful aroma of sweet tropical fruits with only slight hints of citrus. This was really a great smelling IPA. The flavor doesn’t overwhelm you with a face melting hop overload but rather an enjoyable tropical fruit and slight dank bitterness with a peak of resinous pine on it’s dry finish. A good dose of sweet malt held all the flavors together into what I thought was a very tasty and dangerously drinkable brew. Rampant is definitely a slightly different take on your typical Imperial IPA, with more ripe fruit flavors and dank hops than pine or citrus, but another well done beer from New Belgium.","brurevu","Aug 12, 2013"

3.38,-10.6,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and a pretty close to average example of the style, it was unique, but the hop profile wasn't the cleanest and it started to wear on me after a while, the hops didn't keep me coming back for more like some DIPA's. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth and the flavors didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one bottle is enough for me, I don't have the urge to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma they were both nice with the head and lacing looking pretty damn good. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, I know DIPA's aren't the most drinkable style, but it's just not the kind of beer that I have the urge to keep drinking. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's just not my type of DIPA and I don't think I would recommend it. All in all i was a little let down with this beer, it just didn't come together as well as I had hoped and it's a pretty forgettable DIPA, I wouldn't search this one out and I wish I would have bought a single bottle before I committed to a six pack. Better luck time new Belgium, this beer just didn't work for me.","StoutHunter","Jun 10, 2013"

4.62,22.2,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Standard New Belgium bottle with raised neck collar and the simple label. The pour was very clear, a touch more pale amber in shade than a typical DIPA. The head was one to two finger thick. The smell was mostly pine and grapefruit. The taste was quite bitter, with a burst of grapefruit, herbs, and spice right up front. This was a very dry, over the top, """west coast""" style DIPA, and I always seem to like them for their singular purpose as a hop delivery vehicle. This was no exception. There was little no malt influence, alcohol burn, or pretense of complexity here. It was like drinking an enamel stripping, head clearing, tongue scraping, hop juice. If you like hops, you will love this. If you don't like hops, why did you buy a DIPA. A hop bomb picked up at the neighborhood Kroger. My we have come a long way in this country, and I like that.","rajendra82","May 15, 2013"
3.21,-15.1,3.5,1.75,3.5,4.75,3.5,"Pours a nice pale orange with 2 fingers of frothy off-white head. Lots of carbonation visible rising from the bottom. Aroma is extremely weak. Can just barely get a whiff of hops. Tastes great but doesn't really taste hoppy enough to be a imperial IPA. Hops bring out a great tropical fruit flavor with a very sweet finish. Fruity flavors return after swallowing quickly followed by hop bitterness. Hop bitterness does linger on the palate after swallowing though. Not really the hop bomb I expected. I have had other bottles of rampant as well as a glass on tap that were much much hoppier than this one. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and perfect in my opinion. Overall, it does not seem like a hoppy enough beer for a double IPA but still a great tasting brew and is greatly priced for the style.","bennett_loves_good_beer","May 15, 2013"

3.89,2.9,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall: I feel this beer deserves a little more credit that its being given, New Belgium did a fine job. They used a very innovative hop bill, utilizing Mosaic (a new variety) and Calypso (a less known variety) and created a beer that has a very unique flavor profile. It is not the hop bomb that many people want from this style, but it does serve a role in introducing one to the style. I could see a fat tire drinker deciding to pick up a bottle of this, and not being to off put by the change to try it again, ultimately leading to another craft beer fan. Good job New belgium.","Siriusfisherman","Apr 06, 2013"
4.2,11.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"Orange-amber body that's crystal clear. Pours with a two finger head that retains. Good nose on this stuff - the spicy, weedy and slightly oniony notes from calypso work well with mosaic's brighter tropical fruit aromatics. There's a bit of sweetness to the aroma, but little malt character, and that follows through to the palate. While it isn't overtly malty, it does have some sweetness to it, which highlights the fruity aspects of the hop bill. Mosaic brings a great pineapple flavor that's rounded out by the earthier, spicier notes from calypso. There's a slight grassiness mid-palate, and a touch of onion. This is fairly light-bodied and easy drinking for a 8.5%er, with well hidden alcohol. A surprisingly good offering from NB, especially coming in six packs for a very reasonable price.","largadeer","Apr 06, 2013"

Some light, airy hops that aren't too strong, mostly citric notes and not what I think of DIPA aromas, along with minimal breadiness and sweet malts. For a DIPA, at least the beer I had, this was a slightly watered down version as the hops are more neutral than aggressive and there isn't much to say of the malts, although the hops do seem to give off something like sweet or tropical fruit notes. Easy to drink and has a vanilla but not disgusting finish; I'd take this over a macro beer anyday.","clayrock81","Mar 19, 2013"

Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, peach, pine, lemon zest, pineapple, light honey, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of hop notes with a fairly moderate malt backbone; very unique aromas as well. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, peach, pine, lemon zest, orange rind, pineapple, floral, light honey, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Nice amount of citrus pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, peach, pine, lemon, pineapple, floral, light honey, and pine resin on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt backbone; with some light cloying pine bitterness on the finish, but not really that bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a very sticky, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. Very nice and unique hop complexity with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. The Mosaic and Calypso hops were definitely different, but it worked out very well. No complaints at all, really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Mar 18, 2013"

Rampant is rather sweet and a little of this flavor can go a long way. the appearance is a vibrant golden, slight copper hue that is almost perfectly clear with a decent head and really good lacing, which i wouldn't expect with how clear the beer is. the aroma is intense its... (reloading)... oops, i accidentally opened a fat tire that someone left over...i'll just give that to the dog, ok, rampant, yes, the aroma is a loud balance of citrusy and piney off the charts. Taste is, like i said, sweet. Maybe a bit grassy but not too dry.

I liked everything about this beer, even the not so subtle alcohol content, it just works in the context of this light and flavorful brew. also, its priced like a beer not a bottle of rare French wine, which is something new Belgium really needs to get back to if they are going to frequent my fridge with any kind of regularity. bravo for this.","StonedTrippin","Mar 17, 2013"

This is more hop-forward than balanced, and I usually like more balance, but I'm liking the pine-citrus dominance here. Mouthfeel is well structured and tight, and the alcohol (which is not pussyfooting around at 8.5%) is fairly negligible, perhaps taking a back seat to the hops.

However, if you are a fan of the taste of IPAs and want something that tastes great then read on. I am new at this so please bear with me. I am a big fan of O'Dells IPA, great stuff...am I right or am I right. And I am a huge fan of Pliny the Elder, which I recently had for the first time (because I haven't experienced Pliny the Younger or Heady Topper) it is my personal opinion that Pliny the Elder is the standard to which all IPAs should be judged. Keeping that in mind I was very pleasantly surprised with Rampant. I am from Fort Collins and in this town you are either a NB fan or and O'Dells fan (no disrespect for the newer smaller breweries/ brewpubs). I have always been an O'Dells fan. However, with NB release of Rampant I have gained a new appreciation for NB. This is not like Ranger at all. The subtle citrus and fruit flavor mixed with the malts make this an amazing IIPA. It is very affordable, well at least in FC, and the ABV is 8.5%. The hops are not to overbearing and I feel that anybody that appreciates a good beer will enjoy this. I would recommend this to almost anyone who enjoys craft beer. This is not a beer for Joe the Plumber, but then again Joe the Plumber is probably not reading this and is content with his case of Budweiser. I digress, go out and give this a try...it is a great beer.","mosquitoking","Mar 07, 2013"

Luckily New Belgium puts an expiration date on all their bottles as freshness is probably key for enjoyment of this West Coast IPA. Melon hop flavor is one of the most delicious in my opinion and I find myself both happy and surprised the Rampant Imperial IPA nails it. Would I drink it again? Yes.","JamesMN","Mar 07, 2013"

I enjoy the bigger malt base which keeps this beer from being too hoppy - at first - but I find it inches towards the cloying side of the spectrum after a few gulps. An attempt is made to blend the tropical fruit """style""" double with some of the earthier pine notes and it works out just fine, but in the end that's how I view this beer; """just fine""". It's a nice, very well brewed, and accessible double IPA from a quality brewery, but I feel the hardcore hop-heads might be dissatisfied with this one.","BeerFMAndy","Mar 04, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavy emphasis on the earthy tones of the toffee and the green.s A bit of grass pokes through in patches every now and again as well.
