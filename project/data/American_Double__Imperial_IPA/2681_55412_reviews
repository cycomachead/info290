"O - 4.5 - A very smooth and deceptively easy drinking IPA. As far as sessioning doubles goes, this is one of the most sessionable imperial IPAs I've had! Highly recommended!"
"Overall this is a very good double IPA. As I mentioned before, I would compare it to something like Sixpoint's Hi-Res. The price point near my house ($15.49/4-pack) makes this a few and far between type of beer, but if I saw it at a restaurant, I would certainly order it."
"I really like this beer by Oscar Blues, looks like a cloudy golden beer, tastes a little hoppy, but overall a really good beer.  I have never had a bad Oscar Blues beer."
"bitterness. 4"
"O: A nice combination of hops and spicy rye, with the citrus and spiciness really standing out. The 10% and 100+ IBUs are masked extremely well, especially under the rye. Glad they got rid of the summit this year, as the onion/garlic could definitely throw the balance off a bit. Definitely worth trying now, though"

"Smells good, the taste can be a little dissapointing because it does not follow the nose, as their Pale Ale this is very malt heavy and bitterness not your typical DIPA, it does a REALLY good job hiding it's 10%."
"Pours a sunset amber with a tall head."

"This would be a really good alternative to Hop Crisis, which is one of my favs."
"something was off. Had it on draft. Not in love with it"
""

"The aroma stood out for me on this one. Smells of honeydew melon, cantelope, very tropical. The taste was on point with the aroma. Getting a bit of alcohol on the finish,but it is 10%. Overall well done."
""
"O: Great smell, good taste.  Got it in Asheville, NC, drank in Kunming, China on March 13th, 2015."
""
""
""
"The Rest:  This one's a but much.  One glass is about all I think I could manage before wanting something else."
""
"The beer starts off with tropical fruit as the big taste coming through. In the final sips as the beer warms. It becomes a big floral bouquet."
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy head. Smells like sweet tropical citrus. Upfront taste is sweet and almost reminds me of a barley wine. Malty for sure too. Very clean and not too bitter on the back end. This is unique for sure. I really like it though. Hides the fact that it is 10% well."
""
""
"Can into pint at Rocklands. Pours hazy coppery orange with two fingers of white foam that leave lots of lacing. Aromas of pine, citrus rind, and tropical fruit. There’s some bready malt, too. Hits the front of the tongue with malty sweetness then the pine/citrus bitter flavors come on. Creamy, oily mouthfeel with medium carbonation."

"Crispy yet citrusy yet easy drinking"
"I had this beer a bit on the cold side, so it was a bit less tame than it might have been had it warmed a little.  I like it the way I had it.  The bitterness was never overwhelming, but with the high ABV and rye, I'm sure it could have been.  A really good beer."
""
"Hellooo Gubna!  Oskar Blues Gubna one of the most unique DIPA that I have ever tried. The Sorachi Ace, Chinook and Mosaic hops combination gives it a piny evergreen hop flavor with a hint of lemon.  It is the malts that really make this different though.  Rye and North American Pale Malt and Munich Malt give off a spicy flavor I do not think I have ever tasted in a DIPA.  Started off really loving this beer but as I finished beer 1 and started beer two (20 oz pours from my growler) the flavors are starting to become a little overwhelming.  At 10% abv this is a real ass kicker.  If you are a hop head well worth the try, but this strikes me as a beer that you would either love or hate."

"Re-rate: 2014 version is even better. Poured from a can. Earthy fruity aroma. Taste is amazing. Huge yummy pineapple taste. So good. I don’t know if they could top it in 2015 if they switch the hops up again. ---- On tap for $3.50 a pint at brews brothers. Really like this beer. Happy to see it added on tap by me. Love the sweet caramel taste with the pungent summit hops. Very well balanced. Nice juicy citrus happyness."

"GUBNA pours a darker golden color with a big white lacing head.  The aroma is balanced, sweet roasted malts come through.  The taste has a big malty backbone, but a nice noticeable hop flavor, with a nice dry floral end.  Good flavors, great feel.  Overall its a fantastic IIPA, balanced but yet the floral notes still come through."

"O-   Typically I am not a fan of beer with a big alcohol bite, but somehow the moss and oak flavors carry it well. I was disappointed with the fruit flavors as they did not match the nose of the beer. Overall not a bad beer IMO but it’s not on the top of my buy again list."
"12 oz can, 4/10/14, poured into a tulip glass. Orange/red with a tinge of brown highlights, one finger head that moves to a thin lace that hangs on the side of the glass.  S- Wow.  I have never smelled one like this, heavy on the mango/cantaloupe/and whatever those little oranges are called.   The same dominates the taste,  with some strange bread like qualities, and some alcohol notes and burn.  The mouthfeel is thin, with the carbonation trending low.    Something has me wondering what this is like fresh.  Should have checked the date, but this was the first time I saw it, so the assumption was made.  The smell alone makes it worth a try."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a golden amber with a finger of head and good retention. Nose is very fruity. Tones of hop aroma with citrus playing a dominant role. Taste follows with lots of hops and lots of beer. It's a big one. The 10% alcohol pokes through, but it's well hidden considering the size of this beer. Mouthfeel is bitter but balanced, overall a great dipa."

"O: Oskar Blues has been switching up the hops in this  brew each year now, and this year's hop of choice was mosaic. It was a damn good choice. It's just one of those strains that can do no wrong. The nose in particular bursts with mouth-watering tropical aromas. Smart use of rye here too. It keeps the body from feeling thick and viscous and prevents things from getting overly sweet."

"O - Love this beer.  Maybe the ABV could be dropped back for more balance.  But I'm happy to have the variety."

"Was pretty disapointed in this. The taste I got, while not unpleasant, was not what I was expecting."
""
""
"12 oz can poured into a a ipa glass. This beer has golden color body with a small foamy creamy head. The aroma has a bitter hop aroma. The taste straight out is a burst of bitter hop. It also has a malt on the back of the tongue. The hops leave a bitter hop aftertaste on the tongue and overall a darn good imperial ipa."
"Poured a deep golden amber with a thin white head that hangs out around the outside. A little bit of lacing. The aroma has a definite hop presence but it seems it a little restrained. The taste, however is not. This is a hop bomb with a nice tropical fruit and floral presence up front and a hint of pine on the finish. It has a pretty thick mouthfeel and is a great imperial IPA."

"Light golden color to this beer. The aroma is very interesting with a citrusy presence. This bitterness is quite intense but not too much as it is balanced well for a 10%er. The alcohol is strong with the bitterness covering some of it. The thing that really grabs me from this beer is the STRONG grapefruit rind bite to it, it over takes a lot of the bitterness and alcohol in this strongly bittered alcohol beer. It is different than any other DIPAs i have had, and worth trying just for its uniqueness, quite interesting! It is enjoyable, but not sure I would drink more than the one i have had."
""

"Overall - Although I wanted a stronger hop front end to this beer, its smooth, sweet, and toasty malt backbone was a pleasant surprise that makes a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."

"Quick note: Just looked on the Oskar Blues' site and it says this 2014 version of the beer has Sorachi Ace, Mosaic, and Chinook hops in it. Does it change year-to-year? I don't know, but what was put in my can was unreal."

"Another great beer from Oskar Blues. Will definitely keep an eye out for more of this. At 10% it makes you feel good though, but I've got to be careful cause I could knock back several in one sitting easily."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is chewy, very nice going down. This is a novel take on an Imperial, less of a hop blast than some others. It's not what I expected but not an awful surprise."
""
""
""
"Golden colored with a good inch of densely packed off white head. Brussels lacing. Intense aroma of citrus hops is present. The citrus hop flavor is at the forefront and yet is clearly backed by a strong light malt backbone. The mouth is a bit sticky and fairly carbonated."

"This beer is chocked full of malty goodness, lip smacking good. With the right amount of citrus and bitters. At 10% ABV, undoubtedly from the humongous amount of malt, this brew isn't to be quaffed although it's drink-ability invites you to do so. Rather take your time as you would with a fine brandy or cognac."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - a bit on the pricey side, but I'd say this is an overrated brew...I recommend picking up a 4 pack!"

"Poured from a can into a pint glass. This beer is incredible. Honestly i don't know how people are complaining about booziness. I literally detect NO booziness. My biggest problem with hi-res was the alcohol taste. This beer blows hi-res out of the water. It's far and away the best imperial IPA i've ever had. Huge hits of candied grapefruit and nectarine followed by a nice, faintly piney hop bite. The back end is more citrus with some malt. Perfectly balanced, outstanding. Pours a delightfully bright yellow-amber. I could not recommend this beer any more strongly."

"Overall: Not the most complex double IPA I've ever had, but well balanced and easy to drink for its high ABV. The rye is subtle, and interestingly the can doesn't mention it at all, so I didn't know it was supposed to be in there when I wrote this up. What I took as a tropical fruit zing may be the rye spiciness on the tongue."
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
"Overall I'm very disappointed because I've heard so many good things. Maybe overhyped? Maybe I just have messed up senses? Nahhh. Just not into it."
"Poured from a can into a DFH glass, which revealed a hazy amber with a 2-finger head which, while moving toward a coating, never left. Nose was dominated by caramel, pine and citrus. Taste was creamy and nicely balanced with predominant notes of citrus (esp. orange), green apple and caramel. Mouthfeel was sticky and nicely carbonated. Bitterness is not overwhelming but lingers. All-in-all, a nice DIPA option."

"Overall: They need to cut this one down to no more than $12 and really $10 would be the ideal price point in my opinion compared to others. Its a good beer, not spectacular but worth seeking out if you find it on sale somewhere. I understand they probably use better ingredients but when you can buy a case of an adjunct lager for the same price, 90% of people would probably do that. Its just not that special to make it worth the money. If I could get it for $8-9 bucks, I would buy it all the time. This was a one off for me I am afraid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, the beer is a bit of bitter bomb with the herbal and earthy hop characteristics that I do not prefer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Sorachi Ace seems to turn any lump of shit into gold - just love that hop!... all-in-all, this is a fine recipe... body and character still in line with their other products... more or less a one-and-done thing"
"O: A more drinkable, more balanced Hopslam. Excellent. I usually don’t enjoy beers that some might call “Triple IPAs” – ales that seem to get a pound of hops for every pound of malt – mainly because they end up oily, oniony, and in the end, undrinkable (think Founder’s Devil Dancer). But there’s something to this beer that gives it a fantastic drinkability and a hop character that’s not overdone. Dark German malts instead of caramel? A hefty dose rye in the grain bill? Who knows. Whatever it is, though, it makes this a beer worth revisiting. Cheers."
""
"Poured into pint glass and nice color of golden to dark golden appeared small to medium head wasnt bad either. Taste like a flat IPA and mouthfull is just as bland and the taste of this beer. Was kinda disappointed with this beer to say the least of it all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is big! There's the thick, wet hoppy, sloppy, tangy citrus and grapefruit alongside some tropical pineapple and conifer/evergreen notes. This is a strong IPA, with a thick and dry finish. Again, this is a brew for serious hopheads. I found it solid, but not one I'd pursue again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you've seen Oskar Blues beers before, and gave them a pass because of the can, go back and buy it. The beer may be in aluminum cans, but it is of the highest quality. One of my favorite brands."
""
"Quite possibly the fruitiest DIPA I've tasted."

""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: not a bad dipa. Not something I'm going to pay $4 a 12oz for everyday. Unlike ten fidy, this is not something I would consider a consistent treat. However, it isn't bad, price excluded."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid DIPA, but it is a bit intense for my liking. The really heavy alcohol on the fade gives the whole package a somewhat crude, ragged, unrefined feel that will likely alienate those used to more integrated IPAs and DIPAs. All in all, this is not the best DIPA I've ever had, but I do admire the way the aromas and flavors just burst forth after the pour. Not bad, but if you are new to the style, start elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
"My beer guru brought this one over to share. I was excited because I had not had it and like Oskar Blues very much. Excellent looking beer with a perfect smell, exactly what I want out of that IPA. But the taste let me down, too much bitter on the finish. bonus points overall for the ABV. Good but not great beer, one I would have again but not one that I would buy."

"Overall taste and experience: a very good beer, but falls short greatly at the price point. With so many great beers of this style available, paying 15-20 bucks a four pack needs to be weighed into the equation. Try one if you can, it's a 3.75-4.00 beer if money is no object. If money value is important to you, split a 4-pack with friends."
""
"I've come across this with wine, but never with beer, this one was chewable, meaning full, strong bold but not something to hit you on the side of your face"
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale pours a beautiful reddish amber hue with a slight off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is a bouquet of dank citrus and floral hops. The aroma is very fresh and inviting. The mouthfeel is on the thicker end of medium bodied and coats the palate gloriously with hoppy bitterness. The flavor is a purely bitter hop bomb, that (while delicious) does not seem quite as fresh as the nose. This imperial ipa is trying to achieve the dankness of something like Enjoy By. It is good but doesn't quite hit that mark. Definitely worth trying though."
"A very nice douple IPA, lots of good flavor and aroma and goes down super smooth. Very much worth trying."

"O- With all the IIPAs out there, at least I can say that this one is different. There is a definite earthiness to it that cuts out some of the bitterness, but leaves just enough."
"Overall (4.0): Off-kilter, for sure, but I like its uniqueness. A lot of folks will lament the strength of the malt, especially since the rye really sticks out and that’s not everyone’s thing, and others will say it’s too boozy or messy. I say it comes with the territory, and if you’re looking for something different within the style, this is a very good bet. Worth the price? A can or two, at least once, yes. Beyond that is up to the individual."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know this beer causes pretty mixed reactions from people, and I can see that as it is odd. But I do like it, as it is somehow strangely balanced, as I have noticed for Oskar Blues beers in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite a polarizing DIPA, swings like a barleywine in the malt department, sticky and deep but most of the fruit character in the nose and the bitterness is clearly hop driven. I'm comin' back Gubna. (4.5)"
""
""
"O: Can't rank this as high as I want to. Alcohol is in your face and the hop/malt ratio is completely unbalanced to my taste. Lots of malt that just seems unfermented - AND THAT IS WITH A 10% ALCOHOL BILL. I'd like to know what yeast were used..."
""
""
""
""
"Tasting was done from a can into a room temp pint glass. Pours a light golden hue, with a smooth velvety head. Nose is hot, and full of alcohol in the beginning. The first taste is very welcoming and surprising. The alcohol is hidden by citrus and herbal notes that make this very pleasant to drink. Very smooth for a imperial IPA"

""
""
""

"Solid malty beginning, but it quickly gets crushed by the strong straight bitterness of the hop. Not much complexity after this point. The body is fine and the carbonation leaning to the high side."

"O - A very solid DIPA. There are better DIPA's out there, but this one is spicy and powerful. I won't purchase it again for the price I paid ($16 for a 4-pack), but I would certainly do so if cheaper, or if it were offered. DIPA and any big beer fans should enjoy this."

""

"Well, as far as DIPA's/TIPA's, this one has a bit too much bitterness and leafiness. I think it would do better with less bitterness and a broader blend of hops. The finish is mouth puckering and grassy. I probably wouldn't bother buying it again."
""

"O- I enjoyed this beer. It was one of those where the flavor scored the lowest out of the 4 categories, but the flavors were still awesome. It was definitely better than I thought it was going to be. I would have again in a heartbeat."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a snifter. Pours orange golden with hints of red with a large head. Smells of cirtus and slight piney notes. Tastes of nice hops with citrus and earthy tones. Beer is a tad boozy medium body, definitely a sipper, good carbonation. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
"UPDATE 11/18/13: Later cans were not as silky smooth but still powerfully hoppy. Based on which, I would venture to suggest that not all DIPAs being close to a year old have lost their hop punch. Flavor change, though, I can't vouch for at least until the 2014 version appears."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - it's okay, but a bit overdone. I'll stick to Dale's Pale Ale and Deviant Dale's and GNnight for the hoppy beer from Oskar Blues."

"From my tasting notes: The beer poured a golden amber with a generous white head. I got a hint of onion in the aroma like I had heard, but more of a sweet onion with a base of sweet citrus and tropical fruit. The taste was a bitter hop monster that erupted in my mouth like biting into a grapefruit rind. The Gubna was big, bold and full of hop dominance with a blast of grapefruit and dank resinous hops. The rye malt gave the brew a spicy malt balance and a great lingering taste on my tongue. This had a very strong balanced bitterness that was delicious and surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. It got a little boozy as it warmed, but that’s to be expected with such a high ABV."

"Overall - 4.75 - I love this beer, but I can't say it's perfect. The lack of any malt whatsoever is a downside, but only a tiny downside at that. The hops come through amazingly and I'm surprised at how good the flavor was despite what a lot of other people say about it. Great beer!"

"An intense, interesting beer. The one-hop (Summit) character is the predominate feature overall, but may be overbearing for people other than die-hard hop heads. Still, this is a good option when you're looking for something other than your average IPA (or DIPA, for that matter)."

"Overall: This is a malt heavy beer, with a great amount of hops added it to it. It is not overly sweet nor bitter. It is a very unique beer and I am looking foreword to do blind tastings with this one a several other DIPAs. It was a bit overpriced in my opinion for just a 4 pack but this is something that one must buy at least once to try it out. It is a great quality beer with its own unique flavor to it."
""
""
"In all honesty, I would say pass on this. It should be half the price and even then I would possibly buy something else. I love Oskar Blues but this beer is WAY too overpriced (In Michigan i see it for $14.99 which is still crazy). Buy something else that's better and cheaper."

"O - This is a very well-made, very enjoyable brew. Rich, delicious, and nicely balanced, as a non-hophead, I greatly appreciated how the ying and the yang of the malts and the hops are well-paired with each other, with neither dominating and each complimenting the other. Highly recommended, especially for those who favor rich, malt-forward brews and want to venture into getting more out of the hops side of the equation. And with the higher ABV, it also makes for a great cocktailing beer with friends on the deck on a Friday evening."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is much better now that they have changed the recipe away from hops with onion and garlic notes."
""
"O: Perhaps one of the more drinkable 10% brews out there. Pretty crazy. A very well-balanced imperial IPA - definitely not the hop bomb that is pretty much expected nowadays."
""
""
""
"O: Nicely done. I'm normally a bit Luke warm to the IPA's but this one has the kind of balance and complexity that makes me want to try more like it."
""
""
""
""
"This imperial IPA is one of the smoother ones I have tried. It really packs the flavor and the alcohol reaches double digits, but it is remarkably more drinkable than others of this style/strength. The complexity is very nice and the taste is interesting, to say the least. About the only issue I have with it is the price- it is quite costly, even for an imperial IPA. Still, the experience is worth it at least once and everyone who has the chance should give this beer a try."

"overall: i am very surprised this is not in the 90s thwn it comes to ratings. this can satisfy both hopheads and those who enjoy a """balanced""" beer. the 3 different malts really give this beer some character and the hops can equally balance them. id highly recomend this brew to anyone who loves ipas, imperials, or barleywines. truly original. oskar blues never disappoints."

"Gubna pours a slightly hazy gold amber with a thin head. The aroma is sweet with pungent and fruity hops as well as a nice fruity orange character. The aroma is a bit mild, but the flavor makes up for it. Sweet malt mixes with fruity citrusy and herbal hops. There is an almost tea like quality to the hops and a deep resiny bitterness follows as the big malty sweetness rides through the finish. The alcohol is well hidden, and I don't get any of the cat piss character that some people complain about with Summit. If I could get this one locally it would be in my regular rotation."
"D- Enjoyable, but not my favorite DIPA. Surprisingly easy drinking for a 10% DIPA. Lacking a bit in the hop flavor compared to others. The bitterness isn't all that intense either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This thing ain't messing around. Goes straight for your tastebuds with a select amount of flavor. I typically like my hops to be more varied, but this is a good choice. If the price point was cheaper I'd drink this more often than once a year."
""
""
""
"Clear amber pour with a finger of white head; moderate retention and lacing. Citrus and pine hops dominant in the nose, backed with a malty base. More of the same in the taste, citrus and pine hops, somewhat resinous, solid bitterness, with a bready maltiness in the background. Medium body, dry, and solid overall."
"Overall - A unique brew that all DIPA fans should at least try. For me the downfall was too many malts versus the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice and quite different beer that is a great pleasure to drink. It tends to be a little one dimensional at times with the pine and earth but I quite like it. A little pricey but really worth every penny."

"Clear golden orange and, after a bit of a hard pour, a lovely, huge, persistent head. The aromas don't exactly leap out of the glass and consume the senses, but come across as a more relaxed blend of sweetened grapefruit and pungent, dank, earthy hops. Yes, there is a sort of grassy onion brothiness that takes over the back end. The flavor is full of hops...bitter, oily grapefruit, spicy rye, pineapple, and resin. A little sugary, but not overly sweet or anything. Fullish, creamy body and bitter. A solid, pungent, warming DIPA. Surprisingly not way over the top, like I was expecting."
""
""
""
"There most certainly is a respectable hop character to this Double IPA, and at 10% abv it was very drinkable, yet the malts play center stage. At $16 for 4 12 oz. cans, I can't help but factor that into the review: it is pricey and relatively one dimensional in the delivery of flavors. GUBNA is darn good,worth a try, and is quite a strong, but lacks subtleties that keep it from the level of excellence. Another IIPA in a can that makes me appreciate fresh Heady Topper more than ever."
"O- I haven't had this beer in years so this is obviously my first time trying the single-hopped version...I don't notice much of a difference but, again, it's been years so whatever. Great beer!"

"O - What a difference a week makes. I tasted this for the first time last Sunday. I was unimpressed and downright disappointed. I like it a lot better today. I would buy this again after today's tasting. Well maybe not at its current price. I can get better for less."

"Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Initial rye sweetness with a touch of spice. Rich sweet and spicy malt body leads to a super bitter citric rind flavors with a nice dollop of grapefruit flavor as well. People are claiming to get onion scents from this but i dont. Rye is actually a really nice addition lending a sweetness and spiciness which adds complexity to the summit hop."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 3/11/2013. """Evenin’ Gubna!""" slogan. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, light caramel, honey, pine, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes, without being overly sweet; though it is pretty muted for a DIPA. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, light caramel, pine, floral, grass, and piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, light caramel, pine resin, floral, and piney spiciness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and good complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a slick and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice DIPA. Good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall a real bitter and different DIPA, than the rest. It's nose I thought wold be bigger though, but I do enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
"O – Awesome redux for this one. The balance in this is much better than before. Great summer seasonal."
""
""
"Overall this is not a bad DIPA, just slightly too much alcohol flavor for me. If they tuned this down to say 8% I could see this being one of the better DIPA's but thats not what they were going for. They were going for a high ABV kick in the mouth and that is what you have here! The alchol is a little distracting for me. Paid $13.99 so a bit pricey. Now that its a seasonal I might pick up a four pack next year and revisit with the Gubna."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and it was a slightly above average example of the style, this DIPA was big and bold, but I thought it was a little rough around the edges and it lacked the refinement that some of the best of the style have. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and it was fairly filling, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, but with the high amount of bitterness and all the other factors I think one would be enough for me and I wouldn't feel like drinking two in a row, one is more than enough for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was was pretty good and the lacing was really nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the lack of drinkability, it wasn't smooth and it doesn't really keep me coming back for more. I might buy this beer again, but if Hopslam, Double Trouble, or Lagunitas Sucks are on the shelf then this beer will be overlooked, and it was a little overpriced, I recommend it if you really like DIPA's but I don't think it has the quality's to be a top tier DIPA. All in all I thought this was a solid DIPA, but I don't think I will be revisiting it soon with all the other great DIPA's out there. Now that I finished all the beers that they released to Michigan I think Oskar Blues is a pretty average Brewery, I was dissapointed in a couple of their beers and I didn't find anything that I really liked, but I'm not going to rule out anything till I try Ten Fidy, till next time Oskar Blues. Old Chub still seems to be my favorite so far."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I know some people want their IIPA/DIPAs to be hops, hops, and more hops, but I prefer this type. Hoppy, but not hop flavors are not dominating everything else, and a great appearance and mouthfeel compliment the hops and the strength of the beer. I feel this is a damn good beer, and it's dangerously drinkable as well. I want another one but I know I'll get loopy and regret it later if I have another one. A very well crafted beer."
"O: A solid DIPA that hides the alcohol well. Very sweet and pretty bitter. Not my favorite but glad to have tried it."
""
"O: Looks and feels good, but lacks bitterness and pungency."
""
""
""
""
""
"An above-average IIPA that I'm glad I had the opportunity to try but probably won't buy again. There are simply too many IIPAs out there that are superior to this one. This one has a nice balance of bitter and sweet, but the bitterness is too resiny and not fruity enough to suit me. The finish is quite nice though."
"The alcohol isn't masked and it isn't well bodied. All those negatives said it isn't bad at all. It's a big ipa and well put together for the style it's just that flavors don't mix well at all. I still think this is better than average beer, it's just so weird."
""
""
""
"O: Another winner from Oskar Blues!! They're quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
""
"Spared no expense on hop flavoring, and not as sweet as some examples. Could use a little more malt character, imo. But lots of great hop character. Rye doesn't overpower."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first time having GUBNA. It's always been on my radar for years. I really wish I got to try the 100% Summit version, which seemed extremely polarizing. This version doesn't seem polarizing at all. The """onion/garlic""" notes don't seem to dominate. This seems like a DIPA that would be friendly to the masses. Solid DIPA right here. I would drink this again."
""

""
""
"Poured into a tulip from a 12oz can, dated 9/12/12, so it's gotten comfortable on the shelf for a bit. It looks a shy cloudy apricot color while the moderate foamy halo settles around some surprisingly generous lacing. And quite pretty to look at too - it falls like intricate lattice work. The nose is right away biscuity sweet straight into sticky citrus fruits (mainly ruby red grapefruit, subtle cranberries and pomegranate, along with a slight whiff of peach) and over time as the beer adjusts to room temp more of the delicate pomegranate and cranberry notes prosper. This reminds of Green Flash' 'Le Freak' in that regard though I'm not sure what type of yeast Oskar Blues utilized for GUBNA. Medium carbonation and typical viscosity for the style on the mouthfeel. At 10% abv this does drink deceptively well with virtually no alcohol heat on the finish. Next time, I will be sure to crack one of these after it's acclimated from the fridge to the kitchen table as I am discovering with most beers I have tried with higher abv's that they're even more palatable when the chemistry of the beer has been altered by those varying change in degrees. Ultimately, definitely another winner from Oskar Blues right here - a brewery that has never disappointed my drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is actually a big disappointment to me, I love Dale's Deviant, but this is not in the same realm as that, the disgusting boozy flavor is overwhelming. The weird burnt buttery resiny hop flavor is what really does it in for me. Will avoid this beer for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce can, canned on date of 02/27/13. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that sticked around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, orange peel) hops, along with some grassy hops and bready malt. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, this brew is all about the citrusy hops. There's also some light rye spicyness noticeable, along with a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good beer, but I don't think it's $12.99 a 4-pack good. With that being said, it's worth trying."

"I'm sick of buying Oskar blues beer only to discover off flavors. They need some better quality control. This beer is a diacetal bomb with lots of spicey rye flavor. Potentially could be much better, but like I said, I'm not going to continue to buy their beer to only find infections. Sorry for the bad review but come on! This is expensive beer even by craft standards and is simply not worth the price"

"This imperial IPA pours a semi-clear, copper color with a creamy, beige head. There is a mild scent of hops with some citrus. The taste is rather crisp and hoppy while being rather complex. The texture is quite smooth making for an overall tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty sweet start to the flavor profile. Lots of toasty biscuits and sweet caramel. The hops pop in for a little resiny fun, but don't seem to add much bitterness or balance. The palate is a bit syrupy and alcohol warm. Its not bad, but not what I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear gold and copper with a solid quilt of fine whites. Lots of lace. Smells of resin, well actually, this reminds me of the bowl on my weed pipe from high school. Dank. Flavor carries more sweet malts and this is of course dominated by resin, pine, marijuana, and a hint of malt extract. Medium bodied with low carb and a dry finish. This seems very one dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-decent, glad I tried it"
"O - The look to this beer was fantastic. Smells great. Malt has quite a strong grip on the flavor that doesn't lend itself well to the hops. It's a little too sweet and viscous lacking the stylistic backbone of an IPA. I've not had this beer since it was """Gordon's", but this beer will always bring back memories."
""
"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the ale was a copper color with an off-white head. In the initial aroma, one gets the hoppy notes of grass. It is not bitter enough to burn your nose hairs, but you can tell the bitterness on this one will be evident. In the initial taste, one gets a malty lemon flavor at the front. Further thoughts include lemon candy, pineapple, grapefruit, and a pleasant malt backbone. A certain spiciness develops toward the aftertaste as the citrus notes unite to form a warming sensation at the back of the throat. I will note that the taste seemed muted to a certain degree with the beer itself seeming mildly flat. Yet for a canned DIPA, I enjoyed this one. Not the best DIPA I have had, but certainly a drinkable one."
""
"Overall – A big and boozy tasting double IPA. One that warms and definitely one to sit and sip over a long time."
"Cheers"
""
""
"Excellent beer. Will drink again. Must be served warmer. tulip recommended. Good malty character with alcohol and fruit notes. Underrated."
"O: I was a bit skeptical going in as this beer seems to get mixed reviews, and I can see why it's a love-it-or-hate-it proposition. It's a very different kind of DIPA than most, though it definitely doesn't skimp on the big hop flavor. It's ridiculously expensive so I doubt I'll be getting it again, but I do like it a lot."
""
""
""
""
"This is a different approach than most DIPAs with the rye malt and summit hops. Not sure about using Summit for dry hop aroma but definitely one of the most bitter flavored IPA variants I''ve had. I enjoyed this beer and glad I tried it; different approach but there are other versions I enjoy more. Nonetheless, hats off to Oskar Blues for doing something different for this style."
"Overall this is good. Too much maltiness up front for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Blimey, this is something else. Very hoppy and bitter, as well as a booze bomb. Rather unbalanced, with odd notes like onion, cannabis and earthy hints of plant that are somewhat disagreeable. Could do with a bigger malt backbone to balance the hops more effectively, though the spicy/tingly mouthfeel is nice. An impressive effort, but an imperfect drinking experience."

"O - Booze is there making a lurking appearance. I felt the brew was just a bit off. Balance was good, yet the sweetness alongside the bitter hops was a bit to drastic a change in one glass for me. Granted I paid $4 for this lonesome can, I will not return to it."
""
""
"Poured with a nice, creamy two-finger width head that dissipated quickly to maybe a half-finger. Some lacing on the glass. The body of the beer is very a very clear amber color. Smelling it, the beer has the hops to kill, but very consistent probably attributed to the single hop variety used in brewing. The taste is obviously hoppy, but also the alcohol shows itself with a a little more burn on the back end than I would like. Medium mouthfeel, fairly smooth given what I expected. Overall, straightforward, but nothing spectacular."

"Overall- I prefer their Deviant Dale's as a drinkable but strong hop monster. This has some good layers and isn't one dimensional but goes down too harsh to be an all star."

""""Yes, Linus. Gubna. And a right good one at that.""""
"This is a take no prisoners style that may appeal to hop nazis. This thing is a zinger. I can't think of a sharper, more paint-remover example of a DIPA. I'd call it off balance and out of control. I will say, though, that a swig from the warm can that was left out all night was less intense and the hop aromatics were more accessible. From the 12 oz can."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is all about transitions and progressions, and I love them. Starts out on the sweete side with fruits and citrus, then goes to semi-sweet citrus, then to bitter, then to dry and almost ouckering. Even the carb has a wonderful transition/progression to it. The flavors are all bod and delicious and work so well together. Very complex. The flavors are balanced in that they work so well together, and the transitions must be experienced. It's on the pricy side for a 4pak, but I will always have this one in my fridge. Try this one for sure - can't wait for Ten Fidy to come out :o)"
""
"O: overall I'd say this is 3 out of 5. The epitome of average for an imperial IPA. Could use more hop character and a little lighter."
""
""
""
""
"O – I like this beer. I don’t think the onion flavor is off-putting at all; in fact I think it adds a level of uniqueness in a world where most DIPAs are dominated by citrus, tropical fruits, or pine aromas and flavors. This is highly drinkable for a DIPA at 10% ABV. I’ve only had good beers from Oskar Blues so far, and this is one of them."

"Pours amber with golden and orange highlights topped by a off white two finger head. Decent head retention and some sticky lacing. Pine and grass notes with some undiscernable spiciness. Very unique taste, pine, spruce, and fresh cut grass with an edge of spiciness possibly from the rye malt, finishes smooth with piney hops bitterness and booziness somewhat blunted by the abundant malt. One of the largest malt backbones I can remember, medium carbonation, and on the lighter side of full-bodied. An extremely unique IIPA/DIPA that proves that every brew in the style doesn't need to be a citrus bomb."
"do the MALT LIQUOR PEOPLE know about this? rename this stuff TIGER BUZZ and put it in a fluorescent green and orange can and you have a winner!"

"Has the fairly typical hazed orangish-amber color with a brief flash head and no lacing for a high ABV IPA. At first whiff upon cracking open the can there is a relatively strong blast of green onion / garlic but given about one minute of settling down in the pint glass, the garlic pulls back in intensity and allows the aromas of grapefruit and tangerine over toffee malt and earthen mustiness to shine through. The flavor is a lot more spicy and dankly resinous than the nose had me expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise. Starts out very slightly to the drier side of your typical IPA but finishes slightly on the sweeter side in the finish, tapers off with a light onion and alcoholic heat rising up in the aftertaste. After letting the glass warm up for a while I get some additional flavor nuances of green leafy herbal and mint tones in the midsip rounding things out. The malts present as a balancing palette of spicy rye and graham crackers. Medium body thickness and carbonation levels."

"Cloudy orange with immense white head that stays for the duration of the drink. Big aroma of bubblegum, papaya, citrus, soccer field. Big flavor: citrus, grapefruit by the shovel load, grass, pine, booze. Thick body with little carbonation, a real smoothie mouthfeel. Chewy, smells great, flavor is a bit overwhelming with the lack of crispness."

"Overall I really like how its focused on one type of hop. However summit may be just a tad too bitter for my likes."

"O: a different DIPA - perhaps that explains the """good""" rating - it isn't as prominently citrusy or bright as the more popular DIPAs - has a much duskier/earthier taste and feel than most of the other DIPAs I've had - it reminded me of a pale American strong ale, but I thought it was great tasting and hearty drink, just perhaps not as aligned with the style as some would expect."
"Overall: This one was great at the start, but digressed with time. Meh, worth the try but I won't return. Oskar Blues has generally great beers, this one did not wow me."

"Thanks to EgadBananas for providing this can. Poured into a pint glass. Pours light, cloudy golden orange with a tall, creamy off-white head that retains very well. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of sweet malt and citrusy hops. There are some piney hops in the aroma as well. It's a very bright smell. The flavor is dominated by intense citrusy hops and sweet malts. Some of those bitter piney hops come in at the back end. The aftertaste is bitter, but pleasing. The body is full with adequate carbonation. It is smooth, but also thick and creamy. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer and another great offering from Oskar Blues. Try this DIPA if you can find it or trade for it."

"Overall: Bought this on a whim because I was so impressed with Oskar Blues G'Knight and this one falls a notch short. I really like it but they set the table with G'Knight the best way I can say it is this is Robin and G'Knight is Batman. Not a bad thing...drink up, Salud!"

"O: Not bad. Need to try this fresh since it's just over 6 months old. Pretty good drinkability considering."
"Overall - a little too hard to put down with the bitterness in finish and the heavy alcohol content. I'll try to work it down, but I might not finish. Just not very pleasing on the palete"
""
""
"I have never cared for this beer, but I thought I would give it a try at the brewery before a final verdict, and this is it. On-tap at the Tasty Weasel. The summit hops just don't agree with me. All I get is onion, garlic, bell pepper, and dirt - blech. The malt side is nice and bready, sturdy yet clean. It looks great, too. Bright orange with thick, ringing foam. Everything is right except the chosen hop variety."

"A good big IPA, but not quite enough meshing between the malt and hops for my liking."

"O: A very interesting sort of DIPA. I wonder what they did to get it this citrusy. I'd have another, and I'd recommend it. Deceptively strong."
""
"Thick creamy feel. For being 100 IBUs this is not a mouth puckering beer at. Definitely a sipper though."
"O - Not the best I've had from Oskar Blues. The malty sweetness along with the other flavors combined to make a not so awesome IIPA."
""
""
"Overall a bit heavy in the overall taste with the malts and hops but in no way too heavy to have a couple. Completely worth the 5 bucks I paid for a 16oz pour."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, canned on 3/07/12. Pours a yellow orange with a two inch inch sticky white head, with lacing all over the place. Smell is garlic, pineapple, pine, marijuana ,and onion. Taste is better, but for many people way to much garlic and onion. I think it is over the top, but I don't hate the flavors. Body is large, nice amount of carbonation, a little dry, and if you don't mind a huge garlic flavor in beer, it goes down pretty easy. Wouldn't want this every beer, but once in awhile it is nice to abuse you palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very very good sweet/juicy fruit profile as well as sharper citrusy bitters. Would probably like it more as a session with a little less boozyness but at 10% its pretty mild. Definitely a fan"
""
""
""
"A can of Gubna, an imperial IPA from Oskar Blues Company. The beer is a hazy orange color with a sticky head from a hard pour. The aroma is pleasing with a mixture of floral and citrus notes from the summit hops. The flavor bursts with raw hops and citrus rind. The beer is thick with hop oil. The malt tries to raise its head but it can't break through the layer of hops. This is an assertively flavored brew that is surprising drinkable consider the heft."
""
""
""
""
"I liked this one quite a bit. It wouldn't be my go-to IIPA, but it's good when you want something a little different than the typical IPA."
"Wow! Huge thick head sits atop a cloudy, hazy, pale gold. The scent coming off this thing is incredible. I've read about beer scent filling the room but this was my first experience with that. Huge citrus, pineapple, and mango scents. Impressive. Taste did not disappoint. hops is sweetened down by the citrus, but still a bitter bite remains. Mouthfeel is juicy. Overall, the best DIPA i've had in a while."

"O: Not bad but not great, it's a five month old can so it shouldn't have lost much. it tastes like watered down 120 min at first and then tastes borderline drinkable afterward. I remember this being awesome on draft at the brewery. I don't know what it is about Gubna in a can but I would recommend getting it on draft or not at all."
""
""
"well, I have to say, i was a little put off by the initial smell of this one @ first, kind of like a locker room @ half time... anyhow, being a big fan of deviant dales and g'knight, I managed... The taste was quite hoppy and had a hint of spice.. alcohol present, but not overwelming @ all.... the lacing could be read like a book, and the finish wasn't so bad either... I probably wouldn't buy this again, but I would buy all the deviant dales I could find... I hope that makes up for a not so great review..."

"Cloudy yellow-gold, with a small white head.The nose on this had a lot of hoppy citrus, mainly grapfruit and even pineapple. A dry, bitter liquid pine flavor with citrus and grapefruit. The malty balance is there but the hops power through this beer."

"This beer really packs a punch. You can tell that it is 10% ABV."
"Overall, I'm a huge hophead. But I'm also an idiot for buying a 4 pack of dipa that was solely brewed with summit hops. So unbalanced. I've had probably around 150 ipas and dipas, this was practically unpalatable. With that said, interesting idea, it just didn't work out. high AA mess."

"Pours a very pale straw hue with a two fingers width head that quickly flattens, leaving some thin lacing behind. The nose is pretty dank. Lush with hops and a good dose of pin. Little to no citrus here. The taste is an explosion of hops. VERY bitter, with a decent pine influence. Again, this is not a citrus variety DIPA, and there's absolutely none to be found here. Zero. There's definitely some onion overtones here, which is interesting. The mouthfeel is on the sharp side of bitter. This is a palate wrecker for certain. Overall, a decent beer. I dig it."
"Poured from a can and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazy, bright, orange-yellow coloring with an inch of foamy, light, off-white head that slowly recedes down to a filmy covering. Aromas are smooth and rich, with a roasted caramel backbone, some sweet and tart grapefruit and navel orange, and resiny, slick fresh hops. The flavors are rich and roasted, with a super tangy sweetness from both the caramel backbone and the resiny hops. The citrus sweet notes are joined by a pineapple characteristics that blends well with the stronger ABV and hops profiles. A decent peppery jolt at the end helps to keep the aftertaste light, leaving only the slightest hint of tangy caramel sweet and hops bitters. The finish has a decent linger, although it slowly dries from the hops and ABV, so the palate ends up clean and clear after a bit. Very solid DIPA."
""
"O: Overall I like this, it could just use more boldness and more hops- for supposedly 100 IBUs, it doesn't show it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of both caramelized malts and citrus hops. The taste is well balanced and includes hints of spice and honey, along with the expected malts and hops. The 10% ABV is terrifyingly well hidden, the only sign being a mild warming in the finish..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The fine hop and malt flavors make this a unique DIPA. Perfect for pairing with food. Not a bad price either."
""
""
""
"Appearance is a hazy orange with a thin dissipating head leaving moderate lace. Smell of rich malt, grapefruit citrus, caramel and a light breadiness. Taste has a good balance of rich malt and hops with a well rounded citrus flavor with the alchohol very well hidden. Mouthfeel is medium/full with good carbonation. A very well balanced and tasty IIPA"
""
"O- Lots of hop bitterness and not much hop flavor make this beer a bit one-dimensional, but the big sweetness helps to cut some of the alcohol."
""

"I feel if it did that, it would have been phenomenal."

""
""
""
""

""
""

""
"O - Decent. but I've had better."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad DIPA in any way but safely falls in that average category. Huge hops and rye but not enough caramel or other malts to carry you through. Definitely drinkable for 100 IBU and 10.0% abv though. For a cheaper, better 100+ IBU beer, go find yourself a hop stoopid."
""
""
""
"An ok beer, but it fails to live up to the hype."
""
""
"Big fan of Craft beer movement towards CANS. Tired of good craft beers tasting """off""" from one bottle to the next. This beer has the look of a belgian wheat but explodes with hops/taste of an imperial ipa. Nice change of pace to traditional imperial profile. A+ for a canned craft."
"Not a bad beer, but for $10 (most expensive beer on the list at the bar) I was expecting a bit more from this one. I think I can move on, and will save a couple bucks tasting something different next time."
""
""
"Overall: Highly drinkable for an IPA of this alcholol content. The booze is well hidden. This one is highly underrated in my opinion after reading other reviews. May question the freshness of your can perhaps."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a pint glass. The color resemble orange blossom honey, and the head is nice and thick. The lead laces the glass beautifully. The aroma is heavenly. Big hops, a little bit of the onion smell that I hear so much about but I think I've tricked myself into smelling it. The taste? Now that's tasty. Same as the aroma. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel to it. This is definitely my favorite beer from Oskar Blues."
""
""
"O - It may not what you dream of in an Imperial IPA. Still, it's strikingly drinkable. Think of it like an Imperial Pale Ale, rather than a bigger, badder IPA. The bitterness is present, but unoffensive. However the flavor and aroma are present, but uninspiring."
""
""
""
"A different DIPA- not great but not awful. I remember liking this one a bit more at the brewery. Pretty heavy, with tropical citrus and a malt forward body that is jammed with 100 IBUs worth of hops. The onion aspects of this brew were a little off-putting (more interesting than bad though)."
""
""
"It’s OK, and I am glad I tried it, but that being said it’s not one that I will buy again."
""
""
"Really missed the mark on this one in my opinion. I suppose using all summit hops was a mistake. BUT, then again, dont take my word for it because I was not a fan of devil dancer, which I think is very similar. If you have the palate for Devil dancer, this may be a beer you enjoy."
"Slightly hazy sunset orange/yellow body. Off-white head, with a moderately good retention. Sweet caramel malt but a little bit of a vegetative, almost scallion-like aroma mid way through dominates the nose and is a bit unplesant. That scallion aroma follows through in the taste. It reminds me a lot of devil dancer acutally (which is a highly convroversal beer as we all know), without the extreme bitterness. Its still bitter, just not to the level of devil dancer. Silky, velvety mouthfeel with a medium carbonation that is really nice."

"O - my first beer from oskar blues, absolutely outstanding, my second favourite canned beer behind wild onion hopslayr (at time of reviewing)"
""
""
""
"Gubna Imperial IPA form Oskar Blues weighs in at 10% ABV. Gubna pours a very hazy peachy-gold with a thin white head that provides plenty of lacing throughout. A BIG citrusy sweet nose features hints of grapefruit and alcohol. HOP BOMB! This beer features a full mouthfeel with a medium amount of carbonation. Lots of hops out front, in the middle, and in the lingering finish. Also picked up on rye, sweet malt, and a bit of earthiness. Not for your novice beer drinkers."

"You sure do pick up on the 100 BUs in this and maybe it's because I'm a self proclaimed hop head that makes me not mind this at all. This is a big, syrupy, well crafted DIPA that I thoroughly enjoyed. Oscar Blues has yet to disappoint me."

"O: I can see how this is a polarizing beer, but I like it. I wish I could've found a newer canning and will update my review. I can't recommend buying an entire 4 pack of this, but it's certainly worthy of a single purchase."
"Cheers to the best Imperial IPA I've ever had!"
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit DIPA. No real off characters. Plenty challenging and decent complexity."
"I like it...I dont love it. It seems overly strong and pungent. The flavor is ok, but is so overpowered by the ABV. I dont know, maybe its the can, but I seem to like the bottle fermented strong IPA's much better...like any beer, its worth a try. Nonetheless, I am now drunk."
"DELICIOUSLY DIFFERENT, TRY IT!"
"Overall the aroma really throws this one off for me. Considering that I originally drank this within a month of canning and didn't enjoy any of the four pack very much, this one will be getting passed over in the future."
"O - A good double IPA, but not one of the best. But I like..."
"Overall I must say how superior this is to most DIPA's. The hop and malt bill is perfect. It is real easy to pick this up with an old canned on date. Not good. Picked fresh this is amazing beer. A must try fresh!!"
"Can poured into snifter. Aroma is that of grassy, citrus and slight fruit hops. It is a good aroma but is not a strong one. Appearance is golden orange, with sea-foam colored head. Taste is fruity, pineapple or honey dew melon tasting hops. Seeing as this is a 10% alcohol this beer tastes awesome. The taste has almost no alcohol to it. Palate is medium bodied with a resinous sticky mouth-feel with light carbonation. Long, tasty finish. One of my favorite double/imperial IPAs."
"Off-tap in Syracuse this beer was a rusty orange color with one finger of khaki colored head. The retention was decent and it left streaks of lacing. The aroma was of pine, pineapple and grapefruit. Boldly hoppy with very little detectable malt. The flavors were similar with the added addition of alcohol heat, a little tropical sweetness and a little cookie dough malt. If you don’t like green, gargantuan hops you wouldn’t be into this. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium-full and the carbonation on the low end. Drinkable and punchy but a little one-sided."
"I have not reviewed in a very long time. Simply put, this is the best double IPA I have ever had. Significant hops balanced perfectly with the malt profile. I always felt that Gordon did not really fit the double IPA category. So it is nice to see Oskar Blues put forth the Gubna, which is a fine example of a DIPA. That alcohol sure sneaks up on you. The only downside is the price, which I will now definitely pay in order to imbibe this tasty brew!!!"
"Verdict: This IPA certainly wont pander to a hop head, but its good in its own right. Reminds me of Dogfish 120 minute. A big bold IPA in a can. Looking forward to sampling more of Oskar Blues."
"O - once upon a time someone said onion and that really has stuck with me since and reminds me of this brew....i enjoy this brew very much and i think it is a quality dipa the reviews are skewed from all the bandwagon haters imo but overall given the price tag i can get some really solid beers that i love instead....oh where art thou DR11?"
"This is a more piney than citrusy IPA, a characterization that often leads to a lower rating for me. The sensory impact of the high ABV doesn't help either. The overall score of 4 may indeed be too generous."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the fresh, varying hops throughout the taste. The mouthfeel also struck a nice balance, with a hoppy dryness, but a thicker coat to cool the palate. This beer is decent for the style, but the generous inclusions of alcohol, at times, seemed to detract from the potential of the beer’s flavoring."
"O - Would definitely have again, and obviously strong at 10%"
"The body and carbonation are both mid-level, which lends a nice solid backbone. Bitterness is assertive, but not over the top for a DIPA. Overall the hop character is not as harsh as I expected for an all-Summit IPA, but does have a sharp quality. It's an interesting hop, but I think it would be better as an accent to something with a lot of citrus flavor, rather than the showcase in a hop-forward beer. I would buy this again though, as it is an interesting and unique hop-bomb."
"D - Okay, not one of my favorites, a bit too sweet for me"
"Overall I really enjoyed this one from Oskar Blues, much more than their Dale's Pale Ale. It is as solid of a DIPA as I have had, and from a can even!"
"An above average DIPA, though I think using only Summit hops doesn't make for the best DIPA."
"O - I had heard mixed reviews about GUBNA, but I was sold from the first sip. The hop selection balances the malt extremely well, and the dry finish begs for another drink."
"Poured a clear golden amber with a small lasting ivory head. Aromas of dank earthiness, grapefruit, pine, biscuit, light carmel and light orange zest. Palate was medium bodied and crisp with a smooth dry finish. flavors of pine resin, dank earthiness, grapefruit, biscuit and light orange zest with a smooth dry lingering dank bitter finish."
"I like every other Oskar Blues beer I've had quite a lot. This one was decent, but not a standout in its class."
"Overall, it's a solid beer. It doesn't have the bitterness I'd like in a DIPA, but the malt character is solid and the hops are present and noticeable. Drinks easy too."
"Very smooth for a 10%er. I really enjoyed the cloudy light golden autumn color when I poured it. A sweet plum to smell most definitely. A great starter, but an exceptional closer. Hops through out with a glaring mouthful of malt... However, it is deliciously done! A must for all Imperial IPA fans! A treat to the palate, while a beautiful stress reliever after a long day! Won't need many of these after work... Excellent brew OB!!"
"This is my favorite of Oskar Blues offerings, just nipping their other malty giant Old Chub."
"O - Overall, this a a really good DIPA & worthy for hop heads. Weird being in a can, but I can deal.... Pretty hot going down... well it is 10% Alc though. Smooth stuff with a big kick. Thanks for the can Dave!"
"I'm a little surprised at the deviation on this beer. I personally think that this is a fantastic beer, and I love the very herbal hop profile. I guess if you don't toe the line with citrusy/piney hops, you won't please the California posses. Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. After many cans and plenty of this on tap, decided to review it. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a creamy off-white head. Smells super piney and herbal, and fresh, fresh, fresh, with a nice orange rind finish. The taste is also fantastic, with more of that fantastic herbal quality with dill, a touch of chives, orange, and a bit of a yogurty tang. Nice spice and pepper finish from the hops, and enough sweet malt to support the huge, fresh tasting hop bouquet. Delicious."
"Overall I love this beer. In my opinion its one of the most unique and tasty DIPAs on the market. The only beer that i could compare it to would be Founders Devil Dancer. But this is way better."
"Overall a very unusual beer that I can't decide if I like or not. I'm not generally a fan of medicinal flavors."
"This was a bit of a let down, some strange off flavors."
"Overall, this is a very good piney DIPA.  I'm giving it a good review, although I probably should have reviewed it a little fresher."
"O: I honestly don't understand why Gordon/G'Knight gets so much more attention. I love G'Knight, but the Gubna is a near perfect example of an American DIPA."
"This is tasty and somewhat complex, but pretty darn hot. Worth trying for sure, but not as drinkable as the top offerings in this style."
"D- smells great, high point is the feel here, drinkability is borderline """WTF""". 2/3 of the can and a buzz is sneaking up and i'm starting to not make sense. the promise of intense bitterness has been fulfilled although i think that other better DIPAs use a blend of hops for a reason. showcasing one is nice, very nice, and it's a good way to pick out and commit to memory a strain's qualities (especially when used in this quantity!), but there's flaws in all varietals, no hop is perfect, and i think that with the foundation this beer has, perhaps a summit/simcoe/amarillo would be in order..."
"O- good. Im torn. I feel like this beer is on the edge of something better, but it isn't quite there..."
"O- good IPA, but much different then most of its style"
"D: this is ok DIPA. It has some interesting hard to describe flavor and doesnt pack the finish of other DIPAs. "
"Overall, while this is one of the more extraordinary and extraordinarily hoppy beers I've tasted, I can't recommend this to anyone who thinks something even as basic as, say, a Harpoon IPA is too bitter; doing so would be equivalent to finding someone who likes playing with rubber bands and suggesting they bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower. If you truly, and I mean *truly* love hops, this is your beer. If not, you will truly, *truly* hate it."
"Gubna is very interesting. The pepper and woodsy smells and flavors are unique to it. I will say that it's not like other imperial IPAs I've had. It's unique but doesn't have that double punch of hops and sweet/fruity malts like the style usually brings out."
"Overall: I've enjoyed most of the offerings I've tried from Oskar Blues, but this one, well, it just didn't do it for me. One and done for me."
"Overall: Hmm, this is mildly entertaining, but soon enough I am bored and annoyed by aspects of it. As a DIPA there are far too many superior examples out there. Despite all of the perceived heft 100 ibu's might have, the beer is exercising little of the might so many hops ought to impart."
"o - worth trying but not one of the better 2xipa"
"The mouthfeel is great, it's full-bodied and coating, with a spot-on carbonation level. The drinkability? It's absolutely great, especially for the high ABV. Overall, Gubna is really a winner. It's just an outstanding DIPA, and I really can't see how someone who would like, say, Maharaja wouldn't like this. I know plenty of people say """onion""" with it comes to this brew, but I don't get any. It's got to be a personal reaction thing with the Summit hops."
"Not really what I expected - the hops seem to be off - no clean, crisp citrus/pine effect here, just an earthy dullness that overrides the other universal attractive attributes - a good looker, that holds its booze very well. Which means, of course, no lasting desire to engage."
"For me this is one of the best IIPAs I've had. The flavours are really good with some great tropical fruit notes and really light malt."
"Poured a nice hazy orange color with a 2 finger white head which has good retention and leaves a nice lacing. This smells mostly of citrus and pine hops a little malt in the background. The feel is medium with expected carbonation, lots of hops coat the mouth. The taste is pretty good, there is an initial sweetness, maybe some orange, grapefruit and citrus followed by lots of a dual sweet / high bitterness on the way down. Overall a pretty good beer, I prefer a little less sweetness but that seems to happen a bunch with this style."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-yellow color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a thing cap of foam that lingers. The aroma is of rotten grapefruit and pine resin. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with a strong bitterness that masks some of the rotten fruit character. There is also a strong alcohol heat in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is an average beer at best. With so many DIPAs out there I cannot see myself revisiting this one."
"Drinkability: This beer is more of a sipper than one for a session, but if you have the fortitude, this beer is good enough to drink a few."
"Thick foamy head (about 2 fingers worth) sits atop a light burnt orange ale. Sweet malt in the nose. The taste is dominated by caramel malts. Sweet and thick, syrupy. Bitterness comes through, pine sappy, grapefruity bitterness, without any real hop leaf presence. Medium bodied, with medium carbonation, provides a sharp alcohol sting in the back of the throat. Didn't really stand out, but I'd probably buy it again in a pinch."
"This beer is too one-dimensional for me. Strong flavors of bitterness overshadow the nicer, but more subtle, aspects of the beer. No depth or layers here."
"This is real close to being a top 3 imperial IPA for me. Of course I’ve never been disappointed from anything I’ve had from Oskar Blues so far. I defiantly see why the price is a little high on this particular beer. For a higher ABV, this one is not boozy at all and is certainly balanced enough to be considered a ‘multi-purpose’ imperial (if that makes sense)."
"Plus, like all Oskar Blues' brews...easy to bring on hiking, camping and/or bike touring trips due to weight/size."
"Definitely worth trying, especially by all hop-heads."
"Drink- A welcome extra but just a tad old. Ill have to find a store that does single cans and try to find a MUCH fresher can of this. If this is how it is all the time, I probably wont come back."
"Pours a golden to slightly orangish color with a white head that did not last very long. It appears to have some chill haze. The aroma is huge: grassy and citrusy american hops with some clean, sweet malt aroma. The taste starts with big hops, some perceived bitterness from hops and alcohol, and finishes with some sweetness. The bitterness really dances on your tongue. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium with a slight alcohol warming. This is a drinkable Imperial which is an important quality of Imperial IPA's. It isn't nearly as complex as some but a clean, enjoyable, and well crafted beer."
"This beer has officially made me a fan of Oskar Blues Brewery, really like this and their 'Old Chub' Schotch Ale."
"O: Not a beer i would drink again. Like the design of the can though...."
"Interesting beer that provides great drinking and alcohol didn't show up."
"Stay the hell away from this; for $13.25 for a four pack of twelve ounce cans, it should at least help me put a deposit down for another worthy beer after this mishap. Not a total bust but far from good. The price is outrageous for a mediocre beer. Maybe it was the older can that ruined the taste but I would think something like this would taste better with age."
"Overall a very good double ipa. At 13.99 for a four pack not too expensive for really big beer."
"overall - pretty underwhelmed by this. I thought that this was there best offering other then 10-Fidy. Syrupy, minerally, and onion(?), and of course citrus hops. Just didn't work for me and definitely not worth the money."
"The taste is more of the same. Great bitterness and weight. Carried down by the hop flavor. I will never use late additions of Summit hops after tasting this thing. Wow."
"Overall a pretty good beer and a heavy hitter @ 10%. This is the first time I've experienced it fresh and makes it a completely different beer. A more """in your face""" hop bomb for sure."
"O - very solid beer, will mos def enjoy this beer again."
"O- Overall this is one interesting beer. The summit hops do come through quite strong but I think this beer would benefit from using Summit in addition to some other more palatable varieties."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer and an excellent example of extreme brewing done well. It's balanced, yet on the extreme part of the spectrum. Definitely not one for those who don't like IIPA's but if you do, check this out for sure. You won't regret it."
"Overall, I've never had an IIPA like this. Due to there being only 1 kind of hop used there isn't much complexity. There is an overpowering grapefruit flavor which is why I rated the taste quite low, it's just too much."
"Pours from the 12 oz can (canned on 1-19-11 @ 9:15) a lighter than expected pale copper color with a large 2 1/2 finger head of foam. Carbonation appears to be light, almost no bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is lighter than expected, and is of sticky piney & lemony hops. 1st sip brings a totally unexpected hit of sweetish malt, with some very dry piny hoppiness on the background. I was expecting to be bowled over by the 100 IBUs of bitterness, but it's quite subdued. The mouthfeel is of medium heft, neither heavy or watery. Maybe almost five months of aging has mellowed it a bit? Overall, I was expecting a more """in-your-face""" experience from this brew. It's OK, but i'd rather have a G'Knight or Ten Fidy if i'm going for the Oskar Blues experience."
"Overall a good beer but doesn't sit as favorable ad their Gordan, a much better beer, in my eyes. Yes... I know Gordan is now called G'Night but I'm not bound legally to change what I call it. Hmmmm... Sticky Red!"
"Usually love Oskar Blues brews, especially Gordon, but felt this one wasn't quite balanced enough. Personally I felt it a little to malt heavy for me as far as IIPAs go. Still a pretty good brew, but not the first IPA I would personally grab for."
"Mouthfeel Heavier than expected but not a bad thing it helps the flavor stick around longer, hops mmm"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good DIPA. The hops are in your face as you would expect for this style, but there is enough malt to maintain some kind of civility in the end so that the beer is rather pleasant to drink. Though this isn't my favorite style, this is a very good example of it, so I would definitely recommend this beer if you are a hop-head at all."
"Overall. A decent IIPA. Flavours seem a little harsh and it's a little boozy, but not too shabby."
"Overall - A pretty enjoyable IIPA that does a good job of separating itself from the hop-bomb generic 2X india pale ales on the market. While it may not be the first IIPA i reach for (they had Pliny on tap), the pineapple hop flavor curiously meshed with the heavy sweetness for a pretty interesting beer. The aroma has a kind of cannabis characteristic to it as well."
"Mouthfeel only has a brief hop bitterness on the palate, leading into a lasting taste of lightly sweet malt and pineapple/grapefruit that pair well together. I can not tell that this is 10% ABV. My judgment: 7%. Overall, interesting brew that I would love to buy often if the price were a little lower."
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer. It's not as citrusy as I would have liked but the bold pineapple and malt taste made up for that. I'm not sure I could drink too many of these in one evening but it's nice to have on hand for every now and then."
"D would be tough to down more than one of these at one sitting. 3.5"
"O-i've heard many mixed feelings about this IPA, but I love it. its a unique but tasty and well balanced IPA. its very drinkable, especially for the ABV. this is definitely something i'm recommending to hop heads."
"One of my personal favorite IIPA's, and a real asskicker at that. I don't mind it right out of the can, but I guess that that could get my crucified. Delicious, either way."
"O: This beer is $*%&ing amazing. DFH 90 minute, Bell's Hopslam, and Maharaja have long been my go to IIPAs, but this one is giving all of them a run for their money. This has to be the best combination of thick, piney, syrupy, resiny hops combined with a crisp, clean, fresh floral aroma. Truly a fantastic brew and I will buy again very soon."
"Golden orange color in glass, has a generous white head that fades to spotty patches. Aromas are piney and sappy, smells like hop candy. Flavors are well integrated, caramel malt gives a good boost to strong hoppy finish. Pine and orange peel dominate the palate with a caramel and cake finish. Fairly thick mouthfeel, big body to this one. Solid beer overall, but Dale's is much better value."
"Pours a modest half finger of egg shell colored head. Just a ring of lacing remains. I'd like a bit more head to start but it's 10% and I can forgive it. Body is a hazy orangy body. Smell is floral, fruity as it warms up, citrus, apricot peach. The smell is very complex and changes with every sip just about. Tastes very good, orange juice like, carmel, citrus. It is a party in my mouth. I can understand the onion some people taste but it's not detracting in any way. The body is full, light carbonation. A light hop bitterness on the finish, a touch of resin, but the finish is quite nice. I could have a few of these in a night. The 10% is barely noticeable in the taste. Overall a superb beer for me. The price at $4 a single is a bit much but I could handle it if I know its fresh. This on is dated """Canned on 4-1-11""""
"O: Overall I thought it was a good beer. It's 10% which masked itself well though drinking the whole can. I felt it could have had more aroma and flavor but it was good enough that I was pleased to drink it. I would drink it again, especially when looking for something in a can where I can't have glass bottles."
"Overall good and very hoppy imperial ipa that was ok but for its price was expecting more"
"I would have liked this beer much more if it weren't for its ridiculous of $16 a 4-pack. Oskar Blues passes for that price, but barely, Gubna definitely is overpriced. It's pretty tasty, but has too many negatives holding it back from greatness. On that note, I think i'm fit to take a nap...one and done."
"O: I was skeptical of the """onion""" group and I had an older can a while ago and liked it. Fresh, this stuff is just funky odd and not in a very pleasant way. I can see how Summit hops may contribute some nice resins and flavors when in add in moderation with other hops, but alone, it's too green and onion(y). I don't want to just call this an awful beer, because the base isn't that bad compared to a lot of IPAs/DIPA out there, but the hops are just repugnant. I could barely choke this down and certainly wont be buying or drinking it again."
"Serving type: OT and in CAN.. Multiple can's"
"I couldn't seriously believe this is what they intended to release. It was way too pungent and one-note to even reflect the traditional elements of the style. Drinking this was a chore and I'm certainly never going to try it again."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and oily slick, with low carbonation, a medium body and good drinkability if you are a hophead that wants to have your palate shocked and coated with bitter sweet hops. Not worth the price, as single cans and 4 packs are crazy expensive, so that has a negative impact on the over experience. A good beer, but not a great beer, especially at this price range."
"Overall: Phenominal. This beer will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, as though some spiritual hop presence is in the room high-jacking your taste buds. But that's just the beauty of it, until you realize it is merely one and ONE hop only doing this to you, and then you realize, you are suddenly a student and Oskar Blues is teaching your palette: Less is More, don't overdue something that can be done simply! Must HAVE beer."
"O - This is definitely a different double IPA. Nice spice profile and sweet hop flower aftermath."
"I was not satisfied with this offering. It was a gloomy orange color because of the cloudiness. No head retention although the high alcohol content really left a nice film on the glass. Nose was very malty, but the beer was very hoppy and bitter. Not a very good after taste from this full bodied beer. Nothing seemed to work together with the piny hops, citrus flavors and sugary flavors."
"I have a lot of mixed feelings on this beer... I feel it would be much better with a blend of hops or a different variety."
"Overall this beer is nothing special. Drop the hop amounts down and it would be better. Probably won't buy it again, just thought I would try it once. About the only thing it has going for it is it's appearance."
"O: I have to say that this is a good offering from Oscar Blues. It's not the best double IPA ive had but certainly the best one out of a can!"
"Split the can and still struggling. Disappointing after the pale. Hops and malt don't seem to combine as well as some if the better DIPAs. A bit one dimensional and doesn't reall do it for me."
"The Gubna, the appearance is pretty nice. It's a Golden copper color with a white head. The aroma is super piny, not much else really come out for me with this beer. The taste has a ton of pine in there too, some light citrus in the aftertaste bit not a whole lot else. I like the mouthfeel too, it's smooth and bitey like an Imperial IPA should be. Quite a damn good beer."
"Overall the gubna was an good beer and I would certainly get it again."
"Drinkability is well looks great smells nice just has little off flavor in the taste maybe too much hops, or the Rye is adding some sour to the hops who knows. Defiantly worth a try might be your cup of tea."
"Overall, an interesting IPA, but one that I think I won't buy a lot of. Too expensive and I think there are better examples of the style out there. The odd tangy flavor was a bit of a turn off for me as well. If you enjoy, sweet, hoppy IPAs, this could be for you though. I definitely understand the love/hate aspect to this beer."
"Well I'm basing this off a pretty old can which I looked at the bottom and it was over 6 months old. So take it for what it is. I would definitely try this again fresh though."
"-Cheers"
"Hides the abv very well, but I'm feeling this one pretty good."
"Pours a murky orange with a half-finger off-white head. Looks like a good DIPA should. The smell is of grapefruit, hops, and every now and then I get a hint of metal. Taste of stale hops, grapefruit, and a hint of citrus. The taste is ok, but nothing special. Mouthful isn't bad, decent carbonation. Overall this beer isn't bad, but I wouldn't pay the hefty price tag. Glad I received an extra and didn't get stuck with 3 more for the price."
"O) No pop. I like the beer and its take on this style. But the flavors aren't bright. It's interesting. I don't love it but I like it and I think we could learn to love each other."
"Overall, I think this is a solid beer. It is a bit of a palate blaster and the ABV combined with the flavor limits things slightly, but this is a solid beer."
"D - The taste was a real let down after the excellent appearance and smell. I will have to try another to see if this was just my can or more prevalent. As tasted I would not normally try another."
"I'm not overly impressed by this one, though they do manage to do a pretty good job of keeping the alcohol hidden. I would say something like """damn though, this is good for a DIPA in a can!""" except that Surly makes a much better one."
"Maybe someday, if I can't find anything else, I'll pick up a fresher can of this to confirm or refute the awful-ness. Wow, not good."
"There is not too many out there beers that I enjoy but this one is has it. It manages to be crazy like hell and control itself. Big hops with big malt with big taste. Worth the price, though I nearly crapped myself when I saw the price for 4 12 oz. I'm sure I'll get this again sometime. Perhaps when I get a job."
"Drinkability is exceptional for such a hight abv beer."
"Oskar Blues has never let me down. This was my first time trying this beer and it ranks among my favorites. I was lucky enough to get a very fresh can, and I believe this is key in tasting this beer."
"D - no can do. not for me. And this beer was very expensive which adds to the let down"
"Pours an amber orange with a finger of head. Looks fine. Smells of citrus and maybe a bit of medicinal hops? Doesn't smell all that great. Uh oh...tastes like hops, citrus, garlic and onions. Like, big onion garlic. Ugh...this is gross. One of the worst IIPA tastes I have ever had. Mouthfeel is fine, drinkability is nil as this beer tastes horrible. I perused the reviews and I am so confused. I can only assume that some people don't taste the flavors I am tasting. Maybe it is like cilantro, where some people taste soap and some don't. Anyway...I like you OB, but this is not a good beer."
"D- With the caveat that I'd like to review this fresh, this was still a good beer, even if I'm not getting it as OB would intend for me to have it. The sweet flavor (citrus flavored chocolate, almost) would really keep me from having more than 1 of these, along with the ABV."
"overall oskar blues did a pretty good job with this beer it is just personally not one of my favorite styles."
"Taste is more like a Belgian pale ale than a standard American double/imperial in its herbal and spice notes. The pine hops are subtle and come through with some floral hops as well. But the effect of the hops is more of a bitter wash on the caramel and toffee malts rather than the prominent taste."
"Drinkability: Picked up a few of these on a recent trip south. Not available here, but if they were I might seek them out again. Definitely enjoyable."
"Drinkability? It's good as long you already have food in your stomach before you drink it. It packs a punch, so it's probably not a good idea to bring to the tubing outing you might want to plan for (This is for you Austinites) this spring or summer. You'll be out cold fast!"
"A fantastically juicy hoppy Imperial! What more could you ask for? This thing is bursting with fruit flavor!!!! This sugary malt, bitter citrus, glorious tropical beer is almost perfect. It could use more bitterness, but other than that it is a fantastic DIPA!"
"D -- Thank you sir may I have another...and call me a cab!"
"Future outlook: Interesting beer. Glad to have tried, but probably don't need to seek out again."
"Overall, one hell of a beer."
"medium-full bodied with average carbonation. OK, drinkability-wise. will definitely have to grab a fresh one and re-review with differences. as it stands now, it's a very mediocre beer."
"12oz can. Pours a semi-translucent orange with virtually no head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is hoppy. Smells of citrus, namely tangerine/orange, and floral. Picking up on some malts and also a bit of a stinky smell, but it's not very off-putting. Flavor is bitter with a lot of hop flavor. Some omore of the tangerine flavor. Not as much citrus as the aroma but more of a flowery taste. Bitter aftertaste. I can't decide how I feel about this beer. First off, I'm shocked that it has a ABV of 10%. The smell and taste are solid but there is something about them that I can't put my finger on that is a bit odd. Overall it's a decent Imperial IPA, but it is wildly over-priced."
"Oskar Blues continues to impress me. I don't know how their beers will keep over the long haul in the cans but from the cooler, they are damn good!!! With fishing season coming up here in PA and I'm predicting a potpourri of Oskar Blues beers on ice!"
"This beer is everything I expected it to be. It poured a clear golden yellow with a white head. The smell was all citrusy hops. This beer has great body and good carbonation. The taste started with sweet malts and then progressed to citrusy hops and ended peppery. This is a good solid beer and if you drink a whole four pack you will be feeling pretty good and full."
"It's a pretty big and dense beer so while delicious, remains single."
"Drinkablity - great for style, but a one and done beer."
"This beer pours a gorgeous burnt orange color with awesome clarity and a nice full head. Medium-full to full bodied with adequate carbonation to carry this big beer and a nice lingering sweet, and bitter finish. The flavor followed the aroma pretty closely with a little more roundness. I got lots of sweet caramelized malts with a full punch of citrus and spice, almost a citrusy, caramelized spiced syrup. There is definitely a presence of alcohol and smoke too. This is a big, bold beer."
"D - this was the definition of a drain pour in my opinion. I could only stomach a couple drinks of this before it went down the drain."
"Don't get it twisted, though, the beer is solid. Like that stripper, it still feels good. It ain't a high-class uppity show-off, but a basic and grimy American Double. It's the Gubna, a name I find so fitting. The beer drinks quite well, actually, and these canned melons serve the purpose and fit the bill. It's neither a malt-bombed imposter, nor is it a model-like sculpted Sculpin. It leans toward the latter, so the Gubna's worth grabbing."
"D - This does not have the best drinkability. The vegetable/spice taste is just so off-putting and weird. If it weren't for the odd tastes than this would be an excellent beer. I don't think I'll be having more of this one any time soon."
"D - Ahhh! Oskar Blues delivers another excellent beer in a can. I do wish that their cans had the same """can caps""" that some other breweries put on their cans, because the tops are filthy. I have to wash them off very carefully even to pour it into a glass. But the drinkability rocks. I loved the four pack - expensive stuff, but well worth it."
"dated april 30, 2010....bought recently from kenosha's woodmans and still a tasty treat! while its still hoppy, the timem has mellowed it a bit....the glass, still laced with what's left of a lacy foam as a thick, golden coppery liquids awaits... gotta love the oskar blues-"
"Cheers"
"I actually enjoy the Gubna better in a can than in a keg. Having both I find that either way I am going to pour it into a snifter. The high ABV is a plus but this means I can only have a few. the color is a pretty brown much like its label. Coming from Colorado, I am always a fan of brewing beer in the homeland."
"Pours a deep golden color with a one finger bubbly white head that slowly recedes to lace in my glass. Resinous garlic, onion and pine hops dominate my nostrils with their spicy aromas. I look all over for some malt, but aside from a fleeting bread type aroma I can't find any. If I close my eyes, take a big whiff, and think about tomatoes I've got spaghetti sauce in my glass. Taste is actually less hoppy than I would have thought from the nose. The malt is much more present with its bread and caramel, but it barely masks the pine resin, garlic and onion I get from the hops. Long lingering garlic resin after every sip leaves me longing for olive garden bread sticks. Full rather syrupy and resinous mouthfeel, Medium to thick body and light level of carbonation. I have mixed feelings about this one. I could not drink much of this, but I applaud the effort and the out of the box thinking. I think this beer is a great style expanding experiment, but I feel for my tastes this beer hits some notes that my palette may not be ready for."
"Cheers!"
"Final thought - This brew and brewery, are really starting to impress me. Even at $15.00 for 4 cans, I could do this beer at least once a month"
"(NB. Mouthfeel received a 4, and S a 3.5 purely to average the scores out - 3.75 is a fairer rating for both)"
"Syrupy and oily comes to mind when you leave i in mouth before swallowing. Not extremely in love wit this one but has some good foundations and great potential."
"Small head, and fairly clear amber body. As outlined, a citrus aroma (I don't get the grapefruit they suggest; more tart orange), but with a bit of honey coming through as well. Smooth, and fairly clean body -- especially given the heat on this bad boy. Crisp finish. One of my favorite IPAs around in either can or bottle."
"The first thing I have to say about Gubna is that this is a really good brew in a can! Its very rare for me to endulge in canned beer, but this one is amazing! First oof, you will notice the citrusy hops flavor, blended with a sweetness of citrus aroma. The beer pours a unique orange color. The beer is smooth for a high ABV pale. The can states 10.0% ABV and I believe it. This is a pleasant surprise from Oskar Blues. Give it a try if you happen to stumble across it."
"Poured a murky medium orange with an average sized frothy head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing.The aroma was of grain malts, a sweet yeast and a strong note of citrus hops. It tasted bitter-sweet from the onset and shifted slightly to a bitter-sour hoppy flavor with a hint of grapefriut at the end. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and dry in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a nice and tasty Imperial IPA with the alcohol tinge hidden well in the complexity of flavors."
"I'm very happy to say that I fall on the pro-GUBNA side of the fence (mostly since I spent the money to get a can). If this was available around me, it would have a pretty regular spot in my beer fridge."
"Its a good beer, would like to see more hops"
"D- Very refreshing and complex. Too easy to drink. Slight oily finish."
"D: I like balanced DIPAs, so I find this dangerously drinkable. Hardcore hopheads might disagree."
"It's not very """drinkable""" as it has a high alcohol flavor and lots of burnm"
"D:I like Double IPAs so maybe two but they are pretty boozy and rich. I wouldn't session even though I love this style."
"Sampled on January 28, 2011. It pours a cloudy golden yellow with a thin head. The powerful aroma could be felt two feet away with its hoppy hoppiness and grapefruit citrusy sensation. The texture is smooth and medium. The hops do a nice job covering up the 10% ABV with a muted breadlike flavor mixed in."
"M, D- Viscous mouthfeel and medium+ body. An epic battle of bitter, oily astringency vs. syrupy sweet maltiness. The hops actually provide structure, rather than just a bitter addition. Ethanol was apparent on the finish."
"Medium carbonation"
"D: The onion notes weren't as overbearing to me as it was to other people but it was certainly there. This is just a bit off."
"UPDATE (9/11/12): I have no idea why I once liked this beer. Perhaps my palette has changed drastically since then, or I've gained more of an appreciation for this style, but I'm not liking this beer very much anymore. I'm getting a distinct onion-y flavor, and I'm not digging it. Meh."
"D - Despite the strange smell and abv, it is quite drinkable. Probably won't knock your socks off, but definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: Toughest part of this beer to review. The appearance and smell offset the actual taste. This is one helluva beer to stomach, but I highly recommend you at least try it. My hat is off to you if you're able to finish a can. It's the type of beer that's over the top in every way (amount of hops, IBUs, and high alcohol content), for better or for worse."
"Nice looking beer, one finger white head that produces spotty lacing around my glass. The aroma is pungently hoppy, with wisps of onion and garlic. Grassy notes and herbaciousness are also very prominent. Tastes similar to nose, though the malt stand up well to the hop assault. Appropriate mouthfeel. Basically I would say I like this beer, but I feel Oskar Blues made some misques on their hop selection and schedual. One is enough for me."
"D- The 10% ABV does effect the drinkability of this at all, in fact it is not noticeable at all. The grass and onion flavors are what hurt this beer. I know that I am reviewing an Imperial IPA that is over 9 months old and I really hope that the age of this beer is hurting the taste and smell. I am hope to review a fresh can soon. This beer feel like it should be better than it is. The front of the nose and the taste are truly good, it is just the finish that is not."
"still drink this again"
"I wish I could be more in depth. I also wish I could recommend this. Very underwhelming for the style. Simply a poor performer. I love myself some Imperial goodness. This was a kick to the pocket book. Good ol Oskar Blues better step up the game. $17 for a four pack of canned under achievement is an embarrassment to humanity. Drop the price and up your product. A win win. If someone is letting you try it,all aboard. For your personal cash there are much better investments."
"Drinkability: Not too bad overall and it's another solid offering from Oskar Blues; not sure it's something I would want on a regular basis due to the spiciness of it all, but it'd be worth having once in a while; the ABV and sheer weight would also hurt it's ability to be drank often."
"Terribly disappointed, as Summits have become one of my new favorite hops. This may have suffered from age? Can was dated 6-29-10, so I'm at 6 months. I'd like to give the Gubna another shot, but it'll be a while."
"T: Very overpriced in my opinion... especially for a single-hopped DIPA. This is truly a polarizing brew for sure... but I personally didn't really care for it."
"Gubna pours a hazy caramel color with a half inch head that rapidly dissipates. Smells of sweet malt with some floral hops. Taste is a mess. Malty as hell with a huge alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is chewy with a lingering sweet aftertaste. I find drinkability to be low cause honestly, I dont think it tastes good. Gubna is the first disappointment I have had from Oskar Blues. This beer is one dimensional and a complete miss for me."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a crisp orange with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel malts and a hint of garlic. The taste is a nice amount of pine hops alongside a decent kick of burnt caramel malts, nicely balanced. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a nice dryness. This is a very enjoyable Double IPA, even better on-tap than from the can."
"One of the more malty IPAs I have had. Alcohol was well-hidden."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, with plenty of juicy carbonation. A touch of booziness found in the finish."
"Gubna is a different kind of IIPA not earth shatterign but not bad either."
"Reviewed on 4/12/2010. Can of course. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of pine, citrus, hop resins, grassy hops, and caramel malt. Flavor is pretty similar -- grassy hops, hop oils, pine, and citrus. Plenty hoppy and drinkable. I'm a fan!"
"OB makes a good beer. When you are looking for a quality beer with a strong and powerful hops presence, look no further than the cans that Oskar Blues puts out. I was very excited to see this release. I loved the Gordon so much and didn't think they could improve on it. This picks up just where Gordon left off. The nose and mouthfeel are much more refined, and the flavors are very well integrated. Will buy this again."
"Drinkable in a 12oz dose, but I don't think I'd want much more. It's just too sweet. That, and 10% abv doesn't exactly make for a session beer."
"I think this will be a bit of a love / hate type of beer. I'm not firmly in the love camp, but I'm close to there."
"As far as drinkability, there's nothing wrong with a super-hoppy double IPA. I'm a hop-head. But the alcohol is almost too present, which makes me want to drink it then move on. Overall, i do like this beer a lot... And, blasphemously, I'm thinking of cellaring it a bit to see how it changes. I know the hop presence will fade, which sucks, but so will the alcohol a bit. I'm curious to see what will be left. We'll see. Anyway, I still think this is a great effort from Oskar Blues."
"I must say, craft beer out of a can is still a bit of a novelty for me. A bit murky and looking for all the world like unfiltered apricot juice. Big punch of raw sugar sweetness up front, veering toward syrupy. Hops follow with a blunt forcefullness that attempts to conceal the raw edge of the alcohol, but does not quite make it. Not bad, but heavy-handed."
"Appearance is a cloudy golden color with a decent head for an IIPA, but not as tall as some. Smell is hoppy, some malts, and a small amount of floral scents. The taste includes a large amount of hops, which dominate the taste. Some basic malt and sweetness is also there. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy, bitter finish. GUBNA is a boozy hop bomb that is fairly one dimensional as other reviewers have previously mentioned. It is an above average beer, but nothing worth going out of your way for IMHO."
"This beer is great. Delivers in every big way. Hops, booze, malt, flavor, and backs it all up with a fine balance."
"Medium bodied, dry and sticky feel - this beer can really wear out the palate fast, and the alcohol is a little potent as well. A slower drinker, and fun for hopheads looking to bash their tongue into submission, but I can see why some don't like this."
"Imperial IPA all the way, baby. My favorite style of beer just became more awesome. I love when I can continue to solidify my list of favorites with more proof that they're awesome. Gubna poured a clear pale orange, almost peachy color, with a thin eggshell head breaking into wispy lacing and thin patches. Sticking my nose into it, I came away with pine, a weedy marijuana/hemp, and a zesty bite of bold pink grapefruit. All together it was very bright, but dank, and I had a hard time finding anything sweet in it - hops all the way. Once in my mouth, the pine dominated my palate, closely followed by waves of lemon-rind hops, grass, orange peel, and pink grapefruit. By the end I had a thick, bitter aftertaste of dry pine on my tongue, regardless of the lighter mouthfeel. The carbonation added a nice spicy twang to all of the hops, almost rendering it """springy.""" I found that it reminded me of SanTan's Count Hopula with all of the pine and grapefruit running amok, which is in no way a bad thing as I find Count Hopula to be one of my favorite beers. If you need a way to wake up in the morning, skip your coffee and dip your tongue in this - note: I'm completely downplaying the punchy bitterness here."
"L'chaim"
"Very drinkable, moreso than other """hoppy""" IPA's on the market (i.e. ruination, hopsecutioner, hop3, etc). Although the price-point is a bit steep I will say that the difference is there and it's hard to not shell out the cash again and again for a truly unique IPA experience."
"Drinks well for the size of beer. Fresh might be pretty darn nice."
"Drinkability is damn good. Oskar Blues has done it again, another excellent brew in a can. Perhaps they can (get it?) do no wrong..."
"This beer pours a dark honey to light copper in color, slightly cloudy, with a short head that is nevertheless thick and foamy, although it does then rapidly dissipate. The aroma is of massive hops, more tropical fruit than citrus, although both are present and a touch of pine. The taste follows the aroma, definite tropical fruit, some pineapple, some melon, some citrus, a bit of pine, very hop forward, but sitting atop a very sturdy foundation of unobtrusive malt. For 10% there is not overt alcohol in the flavor, but it can be detected in the nose as the beer is in the mouth. This actually drinks refreshingly light and flavorful for its high alcohol. This is a superb Imperial IPA."
"Drinkability is really hurt by the fact that, honestly, no beer should taste like onions. They just shouldn't. And this from someone who loves rauchbiers that taste incredibly like sausages."
"D-lighter taste than other double/imperials out there. What it may loose in style points it gains in taste. I would drink this again."
"D- decent, but on the low end of DIPA's, and not one i would drink everyday- but now I know that good hoppy beers are possible out of a can"
"It's hearty, sweet, hoppy. I do say we have a good beer. Worth plunking down the cash for? Not likely again at these prices...especially with Ten Fidy hangin' next to it."
"Pours amber (fat tire..) with solid medium bubbles and head leaving a pronounced lacing across the surface. Smells of earthy hops, reeeaaally earthy, like pasture, hay, some onion and/or garlic, etc. Not at all unpleasant, but definitly gets points for pronounced and distinctive originality! Tastes very rich. Mouthfilling and the hops aren't in the least abrasive. Flavorful and characterful. Smooth on the palate, with no lingering astringency for a potent DIPA, down remarkably well, but in the end, this is a 2x12oz and I think I'd move on to something else. In the end, I think that speeks to its originality and the fact that you lose that after a bit. Try it though, it is solid bubbles."
"Took me long enough to try out this acclaimed IPA, didn't it, and now I know for a fact that it belongs in the top rank of Imperials. Good on you, Gubna."
"This is a beautiful IIPA! Although I only rated the mouth feel and the appearance at 4.0, I can't say enough about the aroma and taste of this canned elixir! With intense notes of wet and juicy hops that are reminiscent of mowing lawns on a hot summer day, the nose is at first overwhelmed and then transported to a floral paradise. As it warms, the GUBNA mellows and expands with some hints of earthy bitters, pale malts and citrus. Unlike many Imperial IPA's, the GUBNA is refreshingly drinkable and does not blow out the palate even though the hop profile is so intense."
"Glad to try but I'll pass the next time"
"Pours a moderate orange color with a white head and good amount of lacing. The nose brings quite a bit of pine and really dank hops. The taste is the same with the dankness really taking over and dominating other flavors. No ham in this version. The feel is really nice and quite bitter. Dry finish. Drinks quite well, especially in this format."
"Can: Poured a hazy medium orangey color ale with a nice thick frothy head with good retention and very good lacing. Aroma of pine and citrus is quite intense. Taste is totally dominated by the hops with really heavy notes of pine and resin with some citrus undertones also coming through. Malt backbone is also noticeable thought taste is overwhelmed by hops profile. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no alcohol was showing. Very interesting though piney hops is maybe a bit too heavy."
"Overall, very good. Easy to drink, even at 10%. Pricey, but worthy."
"D. I had high hopes for this one, and although it didn't quite meet my expectations, it was not a total disappointment. The 10% alcohol is well-hidden, and overall it was an enjoyable beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer but there are several other in the style that I would choose first."
"Overall: This is certainly the sweetest representation of a Double IPA I've tasted in memory. In a way it's overly sweet, as you drink the glass it becomes a bit too much as your palate adjusts. It's a delicious brew never the less and I recommend it, as it's a tasty interpretation on this sometimes over-the-top style. Easy drinking, warming and certainly packs an alcohol punch."
"Drinkability = Goes down very easily."
"D: Definitely something I would buy again but not on a regular basis."
"Nice brew, very much enjoyed."
"D - extremely easy to drink, but dangerous at the same time. One can not ignore the 10% ABV."
"Pours a fairly clear medium orange color with a small off white head that dissipates with a tiny bit of lacing. Aroma has slightly spicey hops, with notes of onion, garlic, lemongrass, black pepper, hint of grapefruit and caramel. Flavor is fairly hoppy, does have a bit of onion hint, with a touch of malt. Finish is fairly bitter but not overwhelming. A fairly decent crafted beer, and I can understand why some may not like this beer. All in all a beer I probably wont pick up again..."
"Except for the really high abv, this could be one to drink time and again. Very impressed!"
"As it warms the alcohol really takes over, appearing in the smell and dominating the taste throughout. At first I was really impressed with this brew but then the alcohol came roaring out and ruined it. This would be a much better beer if they knocked it down to around 8%."
"A brief taste of toasted malts up front gives way to sugary caramel and rummy fruit malts. Hops come on eventually with a strong herbal, cannabis, resinous flavor. Very funky and earthy. Bitterness is moderate, but there is some lasting cat pee metallic astringency. Warming. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Goes down pretty easy for its strength. Not bad, but I think I like Gordon more."
"Not nearly as bad as I had feared, you have to be in the mood for a dank, hoppy beer, but the garlic / chive character that comes along with Summit hops isn't too objectionable here."
"This is a one-and-done beer, mostly because of the high abv, but also because of the enormous punch packed into the flavors that can overwhelm the senses."
"Drinkability: down a bit for the alcohol levels but this beer was pretty easy to consume. Definitely a nice big beer in a can."
"D - Its ok, just not a favorite. Prefer my ipa/dipas with a more citrus profile."
"I could quickly drink these although it wouldn't be very fulfilling."
"Drinkability: Boozy but drinks well for a strong beer."
"A post-modern beer for folks who like it down and dirty but understand the confused paradox of taste vs. snobbery. Smash that $150 bottle of wine upside some pricks head and pop a Gubna open and drink it straight from the can."
"D - This is one of my favorite beers around, in one of my favorite styles, and it comes in a can so it stays just as fresh as can be. WIN."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkabiltiy: The body of the beer is medium and the hops are a bit resinous. Not a sign of alcohol in the mouthfeel. This beer is a very strong and drinkable beer. Looking forward to my remaining cans."
"D: I am shocked how much alcohol Oscar Blues can hide in their beers. There is no hint of alcohol, much less 10%, if someone asked me, I would have guessed 6% based on the residual sugars and obvious amount of hops. This is a good beer, but not great. I would much rather have a Gordon than this, but I can't quite put my finger on why that is the case. Regardless, that is probably an unfair comparison. Worth trying, but not the best in the style. Still it is nice to have this in a can, an excellent choice for a campfire."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a foamy white head. Lots of hop oils in the aroma, very fresh. Taste is very bitter with an underlying honey-like sweetness; very strong but still hiding some of its alcohol. Finishes nice and hoppy. This is a lot better than Oskar Blues' Gordon, the brewery's other DIPA. This one is a lot better balanced, though still dominated by the hops. Hop heads should seek out this brew."
"A rare non-hit from Oskar Blues... there's just no character to this. It's not a bad beer, but there's nothing to distinguish it from the pack."
"Overall- I wrote a lot about the overall in the taste column. I was fairly impressed in June when I had this beer on tap at Osker Blues in Longmont but would not recommend the beer I'm drinking tonight. It's a unique beer and definitely different than any other DIPA but just not outstanding especially when you consider the price on this beer."
"Better than expected, under control balance with malt sweetness, high IBU but still nicely drinkable for the style. Carbonation right there. Deep yellow coloured body with off-white head. Hop aroma. Lemon and orange and grapefruit citrus rind and fruit."
"Strong. High alcohol. Not a session drink. But a quality IPA."
"d a little sticky and a touch prickly but overall, goes down pretty easy for such a huge beer."
"Hmm, I enjoyed this one a lot more than other folks, by the look of it. This was just a big, resiny double-IPA. Big hop presence. I guess I'm getting some of that onion folks are referencing, but it didn't jump out at me and I didn't think it was much of an issue. Enjoyed it, although it was so big and hoppy that I couldn't put back too many of these in a night."
"D: Don't let the little can fool you. This is a big beer with bite. Strong booziness would keep me from wanting more than a couple. Portability makes this a great tailgate/beach/movie theater companion. I'd prefer Exponential Hoppiness."
"T/M: As with many beers that have complex layers and levels of different qualities the reverse oder: after the beer is completely gone there is a dry, warming feeling. A rich and rolling mouthfeel is met with hoppy resin. The body of the hop bomb is a short blast of hops, but slowly backs down for after spice linger tastes. As the nose releases beer, there is a uplift of taste."
""
"D: This beer is a huge double IPA whose origins and wide distribution may be serve as a more accessible stand-in for Russian River's elusive Pliny the Younger. While both beers are rich enough to earn the 'triple IPA' descriptor in certain company, Gubna strains the palate over time with its aggressive flavors. A closer, more appropriate comparison for this beer is Alpine's equally challenging Exponential Hoppiness."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a small head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is, well, quite the hop bomb. Really no malt balance to speak of. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is not so drinkable. Overall if you like overly hoppy beers, you will love this one. If you want some balance, look elsewhere."
"- Overall this is surprisingly drinkable for how madly hopped it is... not too chewy or sticky... sweet while going down... massive hop aftertaste that some may not like. It's nice to have a can... but it's not one to session.. or even have more than a couple period."
"I could drink this IPA everyday. While I'm a huge Oregon fan, Colorado definitely knows beer and NW style IPA's to boot"
"They went big on this, but not all the flavors line up with my tastes. I think I had the same complaint about their Pale Ale. Interesting, but not stellar."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a mixture of hops and sweet onions. In the taste, sweet onions, hops, and a sweet malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sweet onion like aftertaste. Big onion like flavor in the hops, but hides the alcohol."
"I gotta put it brewery, they make a good DIPA. The malt doesn't interfere with the hops. It's balanced the way a DIPA should be: hops up front, malts playing the rhythm section."
"The body is pretty thick, with a slick and resinous mouthfeel. Drinkability is good."
"D-Just not good enough to make me want another now, or at anytime. From other reviews, this appears to be a love it or hate it type beer. Not for me."
"Drinkability is extremely low. I've got one more of the 4-pack left. I'm not sure if I want to try to choke down one more or use it in a BIF/trade for someone who loves DIPAs. Lots of A+'s on this one, God love you if you like it. But this one is not for me."
"My nose was overwhelmed by intense wafts of pine cone and cherry - was it really cherry? The palate became inundated by a heavy blanket of biscuity malt that possessed a finish that resembled something on the cusp of wet rye bread and brown sugar. I finished the """Gubna," set down the lace encrusted snifter and quietly remarked, """Now, it belongs to the ages.""" What a quaff!"
"Was excited to try this one but I left it feeling a little disappointed. There is a nice balance of hop flavor and malt but I think it's a lot closer to an IPA in taste."
"Pours gold with a solid head that dissipates slowly and leaves some solid lacing. Nose has tons of sweet fruit smells: pineapple, mangos, orange. Smells absolutely incredible, and actually reminds me somewhat of hopslam. Taste is also heavy on the citrusy hops: a lot of the same flavors found in the nose with a ton of hop bitterness. No malt backbone to speak of, just straight ahead hoppiness. Definite alcohol flavors that might inhibit drinkability somewhat, but still extremely tasty."
"Appearance is a golden straw, a touch darker than Ginger ale. Smells like weed, straight up, some hops but mostly weed. I gave it a good rating for smell just because it's so damn unique. Taste is sweet malts, some hops and a bitter finish. Drinkability is way easy for 10%. A lot of people rag on this beer, but it's pretty damn good once you get used to/appreciate the smell. And no, I don't smoke weed but I like this beer."
"D. Very balanced for an Imperial IPA. The 10% is very well hidden under the hops and malt."
"I love everything else I have had from Oskar Blues ergo what the fuck? And I really wanted to like this."
"I've been waiting to try this one for quite some time, and I'm not disappointed. Pours a pretty clear, light amber/orange color with very minimal head. The nose is dripping with pine. There's also an orange citrus scent mixed with some sweet malts. The pine smacks you right in the face then the citrus comes in. It's more pronounced than in the nose. Heavy with grapefruit, then fading to oranges. Leaves a pretty bitter finish. I'm looking for the wild onion or garlic taste, but all I can discern is a hint on the aftertaste. Perhaps contrived, it is there lingering in the background. As you get through this, the hops mellow out and sweet caramel malts become more and more prevalent. Nice slightly syrupy viscosity and relatively low carbonation. Alcohol is quite absent in the taste...though I can feel a light tingle on the lips. I really enjoyed this and look forward to more of them in the future."
"Overall: I really wanted to enjoy this one because I typically like what Oskar Blues puts out but I just didn't. The bitterness and flavors do not compliment each other well at all. I'm a hophead and love high IBU beer but the bitterness doesn't work for me on this one."
"OVERALL: This was awesome! I love me some polarizing brews, and this is probably the top choice in the country in that respect. Everyone should have a chance to try this. Colorado folk, make it your duty to send a can of this out as an extra in every trade. The rest of the world should have a chance to experience what I just have. In the end, they will thank you. I want to give a huge thanks to belgbeerdrinker for giving me the chance to give this bad boy a try. Cheers!"
"D: A really drinkable and delicious DIPA; I don't understand the criticism--this is a great beer!"
"m/d-medium body and bland for an ipa. There is no bitter aftertaste and there is more malt than I expected."
"...revolutionizing canned beer. huzzah!"
"D - For a mouth ripper of an IIPA, this is actually enjoyable with many spicy Mexican dishes as well as seafood."
"Tasted from can purchased at Discount Liquors. Pours clear orange with a medium white head that slowly recedes to heavy lace. Nose is super intense hops citrus with some sweeter fruits and malt. Flavor is dominated by pineapple with some citrus and brown sugar malt, but there is something salty, briny, and weird about this. It reminds me slightly of pre-packaged lunch meat, not very enjoyable. Body is medium and oily with average carbonation and a long bitter and pineapple finish. The alcohol is very well integrated, but there is something off about this as well."
"Also quite enjoyable to have on the slopes."
"Bright and crisp up front with an obviously assertive bitterness and carbonation level. Sizable body and definitely a warm, big beer to be sure. Scary high in the drinkability department! Spoken like a true hop head; I could down quite a few of these jewels. The booze doesn't show up like its 10%, especially not at serving temp. Moral of the story: if you drink fast enough, you're in trouble."
"Good brew. Stands out as startlingly unique among IIPAs, whether intended or not. That flavor profile...wow."
"I wanted to like this more. I love this brewery and what they do, but it seems as if this follows along with a disturbing """too thick, too sweet""" trend. The appearance is nice enouugh, despite the fact that even a 'glug glug' pour results in very little head. It's orange and hazy and that's what counts. A nice hoppy aroma devolves into a too-sweet mess with an onion-y character that totally overwhelms the nice initial hop presence. Bizarre for the style, particularly because of the mouthfeel, which is as thick as the Old Chub and Ten Fidy but in this case, totally inappropriate for the style. As a result, the drinkability downright suffers. I barely wanted to finish this one. Sorry for the paragraph-style review, but I typed it on my mobile phone."
"can sample- pours light orange with good clariy. Robust off white head and soapy lacing. Nose- syrupy sweet, pine and onion. Taste- thick resiny hops, sweet cookie dough malts. Finishes with a significant amount of booze hotness and asprin like dryness. Drinkability suffers from the hotness"
"The cloying sweetness and strong resiny bitterness work at odds here. The two characteristics don't work for me, and just kind of wear me out. Well worth a try, but a one and done for me."
"This is very drinkable and does not seem like 10%. Solid but not awesome."
"D: It's a fair beer, but tough to get through the whole can. I'll stick to my Gordon, thank you very much."
"D - Probably about as drinkable as a 10% ABV hop bomb can be. I think I could do more then one...if I had another."
"Notes: Once again Oskar Blues does it the can and I love it!"
"M/D: Pretty full bodied, alcohol is hidden well. Drinkability is pretty good for me, this drinks like a smaller beer. Big hop heads I think may be let down a bit, but overall this is a solid beer."
"D-Oskar Blues makes some fine beer, and this one has the makings of a great one, but it is just too hot and bitter to be enjoyed as anything but an occasional sipper. At $15 a 4 pack, it also is not a great value."
"D: This beer was ok at first, but I struggled to drink it after a while and almost didn't finish it. At the price I paid ($5/can), I can't see myself buying this one again"
"D - Very good drinkability for the ABV. Alcohol is noticeable but not detrimental. Overall, I liked it, wouldn't be my regular choice, but it was good."
"Drinkability:A slightly challenging beer to drink, but if you like DIPAs you will be well rewarded with a unique complex beer."
"Pours a nice clear bronze color with a healthy khaki head. Leaves some creamy lacing. Aroma is bright and atypical. Pink grapefruit abounds but there's something else, kinda like orange juice or that tropical orange/mango/pineapple juice. I can see why people might call this beer garlicky. There's no explicit garlic taste, but there's a similar spiciness to the hops in addition to the expected citrus aspect. Besides that, there's a pronounced caramel maltiness midpalate that's a bit too heavy for me. Gives it that syrupy maple-syrup-on-grapefruit character. Definitely more in the west coast barleywine vein. No alcohol in the taste but there's an obvious warmth in the chest after each sip. Bitterness is firm but not really up to double IPA standards. Syrupy body with lowish carbonation. A little sugary to be particularly drinkable. This is a perfectly decent beer, and maybe a bit underrated."
"Drank in a 10 oz. snifter from TPH taps. One finger head, golden semi-clear color, some lacing. Smelled piny and grassy, lots of hops, not much else. Tasted same, huge hops with grapefruit and pine taste, some sweetness attempts to tame the hops, but fails. Mouthfeel was good, but nothing special. I gave drinkability a 3.0 only due to the 10% ABV, which can pack a wallop."
"D: This is not as drinkable as many other DIPA's I've had. It finishes hot and is overwhelmed by one dimensional hop taste. It would be much better with a slightly lower abv, perhaps 8ish? and a stronger aroma. This is tasty enough for me to finish the glass, but I won't be coming back to it during this session."
"how interesting to have a imperial IPA in a can... makes one think. a proper nose that has some inconsistencies in the palate that give the malt quality a plastic finish... a tad lighter in color. and weak in malt backbone. this actually came out to be not thick and warm but thin and sharp. finish of soap, corn syrup, and eggplant bitter. lean at best and not something that would keep long enough to have in a can. but then again a beer style that is intolerant to small fails. this is a lob sided beer."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade. Poured from a 12oz. can (canned 4/15/10) into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a glowing orange with a soapy dense head. Aroma consists mosty of the summit hops which I can sense oranges and dark malts. Taste is very interesting. Can definity taste the orange flavors from the summit but then the sweet malty backbone is all over the place. Haven't really tasted a malt combination like this before in a DIPA, kinda different but I like it. Full bodied mouthfeel that leaves a filmy layar on the palate. Overall feeling is this would be a good change of pace DIPA from the rest of the group, very different and unique."
"Good, not great."
"Beer poured orange with a two finger head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is citrus hops but not as pungent as expected from a big beer. Taste is big malts balanced pretty well by citrus hops with a funky onion finish that is a big detraction. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with pretty decent carbonation. Drinkability is average, big alcohol warming with the first sips which is expected but the funky onion aftertaste was not. Glad i tried but it is a bit pricey to seek out again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Really quite decent, carb makes it feel lively. Overall, this is decent - something I would have again. But certainly not a typical beer, more of a novelty for hop heads who also like onions."
"I was turned on to this today as I am an incurable IPA slut and am always looking for something surprising in a new IPA. Absolutely, this is an uncommon IPA. You may think me mad but, it makes me think of mother's Sunday Pot Roast. The sweetness of the carrots, the bite of the onions, all with a beefy back-beat. Its a fascinating, if not entirely successful, brew. I will drink it again, it is eminently palatable and uniquely complex. To top it off, its in a can! How retro!"
"Gubna is a hazy golden ale with a soft, dense white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a huge, hoppy aroma with lots of pine and flowers. It smells sweet with a touch of berry. It's full bodied and very smooth with a clean finish. It's pretty sweet and pretty bitter. It's well balanced with lots of hop flavor. It's mostly resiny pine with echoes of Red Zinger tea. The aftertaste is resiny and bitter. It goes down real easy for 10% ABV."
"really thick, overall somewhat drinkable.overall worth trying if you're into imperial ipa's/summit hops."
"A mostly clear appearance. There is a substantial head and good lacing. Unfortunately, this is the best aspect of this beer. The aroma is comprised mostly of big hops, followed by a sturdy malt presence. The taste is full of sticky and sweet hops, which becomes cloying after only a few ounces. This beer just lacks the craftsmanship that makes a 10% DIPA enjoyable. There are some nice things going on here, but there's a harshness to the beer that I find distracting. This, coupled with the sticky sweetness, significantly affects my overall enjoyment of this brew. Although my review is somewhat harsh, this wasn't a terrible beer. However, there are so many amazing IPAs and DIPAs out there, I won't be returning to this one anytime soon."
"All in all, not a bad brew, and worth a try. I wouldn't be averse to another can at some point, and I'd love to try it fresh on tap."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a 10% 100 IBU brew."
"I tried Gubna on two separate occasions, purchased from two different locations. The first time it was carbed ok. The second time it went flat quickly and has a bit of a alcohol aftertaste after warming up in my glass a bit."
"Drinkability; If you can get past the onions and garlic and farty armpits then you can drink this. high abv but made well enough be smooth. would love to try on tap and fresh."
"D - Went down very smoothly. I could definitely feel the sting of the alcohol which was the only downside."
"Verdict: Gubna is surely a very different Double IPA; from the appearance as it pours out of the can to the aftertaste it leaves in the mouth. The buzz with this beer is that it's a love-it-or-hate it brew, but I'm just sort of indifferent."
"On the heavier end of medium bodied. It's very smooth, slightly crisp and very drinkable as a whole."
"D- This one was a sipper and still a little hard for me to get through. The exclusive use of summit hops is a little overpowering for me; definitely an interesting idea though."
"D: The best thing I can say about this beer is that it isn't as bad as I was fearing...it tastes alright but the smell wears on you and the mouthfeel is pretty far from what it should be."
"This stuff is just as good in a can as it was fresh. Absolutely amazing! Very relaxing and pleasant tasting brew. Probably one of the BEST I've ever had in the DIPA category. The can has a more balanced carbonation and lacing over the growler. These DIPA's have different tastes, but are absolutely perfect when manufactured with quality as this one is."
"D: Once is enough in a sitting but if I saw it again I would def go for it"
"Split it with some friends who like to split beer. Smells herbal and earthy, dirty yellow color. Not expecting a bright flavor out of it. And damn sure didn't get it. No hops, mostly stir fried veggies, predominantly yellow bell peppers. Within three sips its gone from bad to worse. This beer saw the benchmark for an Imperial IPA, ran the other way and tripped leaving it stranded in a realm of disgust. Its not the worst beer I've had but in terms of expectation for a style and respect for experimentation this has turned out a mess. If you're going to sell this, categorize it differently or something. QC may have just botched this batch. This beer is undesirable in every way."
"I'm trying to be as colorful as I can because words cannot describe the bizarre sensations this beer caused in me. That grainy quality combined with everything else... all I could picture the whole time was a litter box, it was like a bad dream."
"Drinkability: Maybe a bit past its prime (I believe Gubna was brewed back in the early spring), but still quite good. Not sure if I'll be purchasing it again, but I certainly enjoyed the experience. Worth a try."
"A nice dryness and the abv adds some heat. Unbalanced for sure. Not the most drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is moderately light, slightly sticky. Not a pounder, more of a sipper. Nice."
"Grapefruit, citrus and piney resin smell. Citrus, pine and orange peel flavors. Actually creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced hoppiness. Yum."
"If you can get past the taste this is a decent beer. The mouthfeel has all the warmth and pinch that a IIPA should have. The bitterness raws up my teeth and has everything I'm looking for in a beer. I just can't get over the poor flavor. It is so good everywhere else but in the flavor department. What happened? Pass on this one, even if it's free."
"D - It's a sip & swirl brew, I could see myself enjoying a snifter after a long day but not anymore than that. One of the better DIPA's Ive had, and I definitely liked the fact that it isn't sugary or syrupy. I'm not big on the style but I might buy this one again sometime."
"D- well its a trip and a half but all in all I feel for a single hop beer a different hop might have done better. Not bad just super interesting."
"D: It starts well and ends horribly. Not finishing this but glad I tried it. Now I know to stay away from 100% Summit hop beers."
"D - Scary easy to drink at 10% ABV, be careful!"
"Hops are sharp in the flavor and very onion-y, resinous like smoking a bowl of red onions out of a 3-footer. Nothing in the way of a malt backbone. Flavoring and bittering hops are in equilibrium and have a certain smoothness, but the varietal choice is totally not for me. Waaay too much onion for me, and I like onions...just not in my beer. I am glad I split even this one single can I bought, a 6 oz sample was plenty for me. Surly blows this out of the water, easily."
"Excellent beer overall!"
"D: A rare disappointment from an outstanding brewery. I'm a big fan of Gordon, but this one falls short in its lack of character, literally """green""" taste, and texture. Pass."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Surprisingly easy to drinl and smooth for a 10% beer. Great aftertaste."
"They need to barrel age this bad boy...call it Gubnator. ...That sounded funny in my head. Yeah. Anyway, it pours a cloudy sunset orange topped by a half-finger of quickly-dying white foam. The nose comprises a haymaker of hoppiness, as though a citrus blend (like those from Dole) was cut with a healthy amount of pine sap. There's also a sort of leek-like character in there as well, along with what seems like some spicy pepper. After this assault, a meek contingent of light caramel tries vainly to pitch a tent on the ruins. The taste follows in lock-step, with a hefty amount of oddly peppered hoppy bitters and leeks swarming the tongue, followed by a comparatively faint bit o' caramel. The hops...the hops... The body is a fairly hefty medium, with light carbonation and a somewhat chewy feel and sticky finish. Overall, an experience, yes, but not the greatest in the world. I think it's the pepper. Maybe."
"D: A good DIPA, but not one of OB's best efforts. ABV is hidden fairly well here, but the syrupyness deducts slightly."
"D: A nice offering from Oskar Blues. This is definitely deserving of a try but the high ABV makes this a one and done for me."
"Other Notes - I'm very disappointed with this. I expected a hop bomb in a can and was instead greeted with a decent bitter kick and some citrusy flavors far subdued compared to my hopes. I probably wont buy this again especially because of the price. Were the cans more reasonable i might be more inclined to give this one another shot."
"Overall, pretty good, but not great by any means. I feel that Gordon was a FAR better DIPA. While I very much appreciate the balance and restraint here, especially considering the ABV and mouthfeel, along with the fact that it is not sweet at all. It's well crafted, it tastes good, it's balanced... but that's not why I drink DIPA's. Overload me on hop flavor and aroma. Singe my taste buds. Help it live up to the double moniker. Give me something with the hop presence of Gordon, but the dryness and mouthfeel of Gubna. You figure that one out, and you've got a real winner."
"Took a shot with a single can of Gubna. I was cautious going in due to the summit hops, which I really disliked in some other beers. However, I didn't get the onion/garlic flavors from them here--I thought this was a solid DIPA with good balanced sweetness and bitterness."
"D - Interesting beer. Unlike any other I have had. I don't think I would want to drink this often but it is a nice change of pace from other DIPA's. I would recommend this to any fan of DIPA's in a heartbeat. I would drink this one again if I was in the mood but I would not go crazy trying to get more of this unless I was really jonesing for it's flavor."
"Drinkability- Fairly decent, I would attempt a second can worth. This beer is definitely different though."
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice citrus hop scent along with some subtle hints of rye and bisquit malts. The taste is decent as well. It's incredibly complex with loads of hop character and a serious malt bill. The rye is very pronounced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This isn't the best DIPA out there. It's malt forward with tons of complexity. I prefer one that's not too heavy in the mouthfeel. Overall, not bad."
"The price point for this fellow is a bit off-putting. At almost $4 a can the impact of the brew didn't quite make me say it's worth it. Given the flavors, for very similar money i could have two six packs of Dale's for the price of one four pack of Gubna. Still I can't fault the brewing. I intend to have a taste test between this and Gordon. While I didn't get to have Gordon in a can, I recall that on tap it was delicious."
""""Liquid Phish concert""""
"mouthfeel is very good, and I would like to have another, which is a disappointment since I bought only one can. :("
"D - This selection from OB is kinda out there. Not sure if this onion thing is intentional, but aside from that, it is a solid brew."
"Taste is great, the hops really aren't too strong but it's very drinkable and quite tasty. It's very light bodied and very drinkable."
"Nice light finish with long lingering flavor is superb. i plowed through this can in no time, simply an amazing beer, nees to get more credit."
"D: I don't quite know what to make of this. I wouldn't quite say that it's bad, but the off flavors definitely detract from the overall experience. In the end, it's nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"feels smooth while drinking, but the overpowering nature of the big dose of summit hops really detracts from the drinkability"
"Pours a slightly viscous peachy-gold hue, with a sticky white lace. Sweet aroma of candied tropical fruit, with a hint of that earthy/onion-like note everybody is complaining about. I don't get too much of it though. Starts off with caramel sweetness up front, with a zing of citrus rind hops in the back. Interesting tropical fruit flavors from the hops integrating with the esters from the heavy malt. Slightly chewy body, a little sticky. Nice flavors but I find this one a little under attenuated, my most common complaint with these huge DIPAs. Its just too sweet to allow the hops to really shine, which results in an unpleasant cloying in the finish. Definitely won't be paying over $4 for another can of this."
"Notes: Good beer. Not my favorite impy ipa, but damn good and it's in a can for god's sake! Rock."
"Overall, Gubna is an excellent example of an imperial IPA. It's strong, and overly hopped...giving it a sensational aroma and flavor, but making it less drinkable and one that should be shared with friends."
"D - Besides being 10% this beer had a definite alcohol present and not much malt backbone to take away from the bitterness"
"Poured nice with a decent head and left some sticky lacing. This smelled great to me! Loads of fresh hops, decent malt backbone and floral sweetness that I love in an IPA. This is a nicely balanced IPA with a lot going on flavor wise. I got the obvious sticky pine resin and then balanced out with decent maltiness, sweet fresh flowers, anda bit of honey. It did have a bitter aftertaste but that was not entirely unexpected and was my only negative comment. Great smooth mouth feel, I may only have a couple of these at most but very drinkable."
"D- drinkable. I really like DIPA style beers, however this isn't one I would go out of my way to buy. In fact I probably won't buy it again. I'd rather have a pliny or even a conductor."
"Drink: well I didnt really like it overall and wouldnt want to drink it again. There was a lot of hype about this, maybe this one was bad? Dont know but I had to chug this glass down."
"D: 10% catches you off guard, it is well masked. GUBNA is a different sort of IPA with a flavor profile that is a challenge to many and a joy to some."
"Pours a clear amber with a decent eggshell colored head that falls to nothing after not too long. Nose is a tight pine tone. Flavor is...a bit unusual for the style, I think. A bit earthy and rough on the aftertaste and slightly stringent. And there is a bit of an unpleasant alcohol burn on the end too that stays in my mouth as an aftertaste. Seems a bit wrinkled and needs a run through with an iron to straighten things out a bit. Which I guess sums things up for this beer in general really. Not entirely a miss, but could've and should've been a whole lot more."
"Thin cream white head, barely gets to half a finger, not much retention either, lacing slightly above average. Very cloudy with a warm glow, offers a light orange to yellow hue, even with strong translucency you can see many active bubble beads. No lack of grapefruit, orange citrus in the nose, however, most marked by peat moss and lichen sort of scrub notes, charcoal ash and then scone to biscuit breadiness, followed on by golden raisin, peach, apricot scents, pine and honey, sweetens as it warms. Medium-bodied, the carbonation comes off a bit too """fluffy""" as if masking the lack of natural heft. Loses a lot of the herbal dimension here, milk chocolate and vanilla pair up with the tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus for a sherbet like mix. Biscuit to corn bread more than """bready""" per se. Pine tar like the resin on a baseball bat. Lacks substantive hop bite but avoids slouching. Interesting to try but doesn't make you yearn for more, methinks its reach exceeds its grasp."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink given the alcohol content--it's apparent but well masked."
"Served in a pint glass at Homemade Liquids and Solids. Apple cider colored. Cloudy with no signs of carbonation. Very little head. Some created on swirling, but not long lived. Lots of lace, though. Big aromatic pine aroma with sweet honey hints. Very soft mouthfeel, as if hand pumped. Bitter and piney up front with creamy, slightly sweet middle and long bitter finish. Served slightly warmer than most drafts. Perfect temperature. Alcohol well hidden. One of the best DIPAs I've had."
"Drinkability: I quite enjoyed this, and as a huge DIPA fan it's always great to find another drinkable, flaorful DIPA. The 10.0% is nothing to sneeze at - it was the only beer I had that evening, and I couldn't imagine having too many of these in a row. I was a huge fan of the flavor profile though, the bitterness level, and the """make""" of this beer - definitely a sipper, but definitely one worth sipping."
"A grimy, greasy, dirty Dbl IPA that is quite the fun ride of hopitude of citric flintyness and hidden ABV that catches you off guard and creates one heck of a nice tone of earthy, off-the-vine hop cone floralness. Drinks down easy enough but will catch up to ya before ya know it."
"Another DIPA that smells great & tastes like an overly sweet, overly hot semi-mess. Not sure it's worth my sobriety, but I'd give it another chance in the future."
"D - Pleasant beer for this style, enjoyed it."
"D: Not diggin' this one at all. Didn't even finish it and I can't remember the last time I could say that about an IPA/DIPA."
"I bought this beer in a 4 pack from the Whip-In in Austin, Texas, and I can only assume that this has got to be a bad batch that is throwing off this body odor hop flavor. I can't say I am willing to try another to test my theory, which is a shame as I have absolutely loved all the other beers from Oskar Blues that I have tried."
"This is certainly a different sort of IPA. I guess it's the use of 100% Summit hops that gives it its unique character. I'm really not sure if that's entirely a good thing or not. It was definitely interesting and I'm glad I tried it; I just don't think I'll be revisiting it any time soon. It's worth a try if you're a fan of the style."
"Poured a nicely hazy tangerine with a thick opal head. Chunks of lace adorning the chalice. I was surprised by the strong citrus and onion-like aroma, perhaps a pungent smell of... urine? Um, I hope no one peed in my beer. The taste is just as weird. A strong metallicness melding with lots of grapefruit, a hint of pineapple, and... onions? Dude, this is quite odd. Onions and alcohol warmth. I'm not too happy with this right now, though I'm sure I can get used to it. A decently bodied beer with crisp carbonation. But I just couldn't finish a glass of it. Didn't know it was all summit before this too. I guess I won't be brewing with that type of hop!"
"Thanks BrokenStv!"
"Drinkability is going to depend on your tolerance for Summit hop. Personally I like this."
"Golden orange with nice clarity. Bubbly complexity. The smell is a mix of citrus hops and a slight grainy sweetness. Maybe I just don't like Summit hops all that much, but it just seemed a little one dimensional. Taste was similar, with a pretty chewy and oily mouthfeel. As far as DIPA's go, I would say that this is a very average beer."
"When I had this on tap however I found it to be very intense on the alcohol and a little cloying for my taste. I'll try it again, but it's not the best beer for the summer."
"My first craft beer in a can! Pours a golden orange that looks crystal clear and sharp. Lots of little bubbles at first. Smells very hoppy and sweet too. Tastes of caramal honey with a nice hop bite and bitterness to it. Very smooth overall and the 10$ alc. what this is 10%? shit. I couldn't tell. Really enjoyed this one."
"D: Suprisingly good considering how unmasked the booziness is. Nice, but balance the booziness in upcoming batches and watch the score rise."
"D- Good, but the carbination could help this out more."
"Overall not bad, but certainly nothing spectacular, and the hint of onion from the Summit hops detracts from the experience. Drinkability is hindered due to alcohol content and, again, the off-putting flavor. Interesting, and perhaps a lower price point would make this beer more enticing, but as it is, it's much too expensive for being so lackluster in so many areas."
"good carbination and body. the touch of onion detracts from drinkability."
"I'm surprised this beer doesn't get higher scores. It's not the most exciting DIPA out there, it's very different, but it is solid. Worth a try."
"This is probably a well made beer and it could be exactly as the brewer wants it to be, but it just isn't working for me. I'm glad I got the chance to try it, but I think I'll pass on it again in the future."
"This one really caught me off guard. Everything else that I've had from OB has been great so expected this to follow suit. I just don't understand how this one made it all the way to the can. Someone in the brewing process should have realized that the flavors here just aren't right."
"A bit warming, alcohol is present but not overly so. Lively enough to keep the thickness down. It's the spiciness that makes this a one and done."
"D - Pretty tasty brew, but between the 10% ABV and the mild astringency on the finish, I think I will stick with one."
"An appropriately hoppy Imperial IPA. Good job OB."
"This is a well made ale that the hop-heads are gonna love. For me it's a bit much, even as one who loves the hopped up brews."
"GUBNA doesn't grab my senses like other DIPA's, but its laid-back is a change from business as usual. Personally, for the money, I'd go for the hundreds of lower ABV beers on the market if I wanted a """laid back """ beer, and I'd stick with Dale's Pale Ale in the Oskar Blues portfolio if I wanted a hoppy treat."
"Not likely to get again."
"one and done. took me awhile to finish even a 4 pack of this. i remeber the first one or 2 i had when i bought them a week or 2 ago where somewhat better than this last one. and there only a month old, so freshness may really be an issue. oskar blues makes great beers, but this, surprisingly is not one of them, i had kind of high hopes for this one, there was a lot of hype, but plain out dont like it. gordon is a way better ipa."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. This is my first craft beer from a can. Orange-yellow pour with almost no head and minimal lacing. Really big, unique nose! Orange jello, and something else I can't quite put my finger on. Taste is also very unique. Not like any Imperial IPA I've had before. I'm tasting the orange jello for sure and some citrus and alcohol, but there's a wierd faint onion taste also. It's slightly syrupy in the mothfeel but not bad. Fairly drinkable for a 10% beer. I'm still not sure if the wierd, smell and taste is pleasing or not. Definitely unique."
"I can't make up my mind on drinkability, so I'm going to go with """average.""" The first taste is good and leaves me wanting to drink more, but that aftertaste and mouthfeel makes me ask """why?""" I definitely won't be seeking this one out again. In my opinion Gordon is a far better hoppy offering from OB."
"A very excellent DIPA from a can."
"I drank this from a 12oz can into my Rochefort glass....The beer pours a medium gold with hints of orange. Not much head at all, white and gone in a couple seconds...The aroma is light but extremely acidic, pine and metal underlaced by some grapefruit to start. Very sharp bitterness but only briefly...The taste is malty to start but almost too sweet not any acidity to balance. There is tons of light piney hops, its ok nothing special. Very alcoholic. The beer is pretty watery ok to drink."
"Yep... this beer is the next best thing to PtY and god."
"Chewy medium body that is very hop forward with a strong earthy pine hop presence that lingers throughout into a long, bone dry finish. Pale malt backbone provides very subtle balanced but this beer is all about the hops. Slightly soily with a nice sweet citrus fruit presence. Lots of mango, grapefruit, orange peel and pineapple. Sweet alcohol provides a bit of heat and warmth in the chest. Well balanced and complex but just a touch too soily and dry. Pretty good. I'm not sure why there is so much hate towards this one."
"GUBNA carries itself with that John Wayne attitude - it epitomizes all the rugged, brazen, larger-than-life ideals of an American icon. That being said, it's no surprise that such a burly and obnoxious 10% beer has polarized people the way this one has. You ask me, as far as the ideal American DIPA: this GUBNA isn't the right man for the job."
"I have to admit, this beer is enjoyable if only because it's making me laugh. Also, despite the strange flavor, it's a truly well-made DIPA. Great feel, strong hops flavor, smells good, looks good. Still, if 100% Summit hops in a well-made IPA yields onions and weed, I vote that you put some different hops in the beer."
"D: eh, not so sure about this. Flavor and aroma are pretty good, but the alcohol is overly aggressive and not at all well hidden. It's like I want to keep coming back for more, only to be punished for it."
"The first time I tried a sample of this, the onion was overwhelming. I enjoyed the full serving much more, but I can see how people would be put off by the flavor."
"Thanks to Ohoove for this highly unique offering. A nice clear amber color with a modest off-white head and good lacing coats the glass. The aroma is a unique rhubarb apple vinegar, odd skunky prune and olive wierdness. It finally hit me that it smells like pearled onions! Wow. I mean OW! Can't say I like it but it really makes me wonder WTF it could possible taste like (not this I hope). The flavor is an intense sweet potatoe turnip and floral perfume in a near full bodied brew. Tangy intense swampiness with a herbal hop bite. It's sort of bright with relatively fine, full carbonation, full bodied and viscous and hard to ignore. But I doubt I will ever buy more of this. Give them credit for a quality feel and a different sort of brew. But this might be a drain pour for some. Just not too delectable and certainly not a session beer."
"As much as this beer gets railed on, and justly so for it's ridiculous $16/4-pack price tag, this wasn't anywhere near as bad. Perhaps it's the fact that it's pretty fresh, or perhaps I'm an idiot... but I'm looking forward to finishing the pack."
"D- A sweet, but enjoyable take on the style. The alcohol is well hidden. Stands out, but doesn't blow me away."
"This is like a grain alcohol, hops, and pork slurry. Must be what pork soda is."
"Morey's Bottom Line: The boldest beer that this geek has had out of a can to date. An above average, yet not quite elite DIPA."
"D- I wouldn't call this very drinkable. The hops are strong, and the alcohol really starts to show through as you continue to drink. Also, that mouthfeel...ugh. Wouldn't buy again, and I'm starting to think Oskar Blues just isn't for me."
"Hops here are rough and raw. This one comes off as unsophisticated and nearly undrinkable. An interesting effort from a brewery whose other products I greatly enjoy."
"Overall: As I drink this beer I'm can't help thinking that it seems like a really cool but ultimately unsuccessful single hop experiment. I really liked the orange character that I was getting at first in the aroma but I tasted too much onion/garlic to make the flavor really enjoyable. In the end, this is why you blend hops - to get a more balanced beer with a variety of flavors and aromas. I learned a lot about the character of Summit hops but I guess you have to be careful how you use them. I'd recommend trying it once to decide for yourself. It's certainly a well made beer but doesn't have the right balance and complexity for me to buy another."
"D- If you can get over the aroma, it is a solid beer. If you can't get over it, you are going to have problems with this beer."
"First off nobody should ever brew an all Summit hopped anything, this brew was an onion/garlic bomb that really started to offend me while I was drinking it. Poured a clear amber hue with a bright white head formed fine even lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma was bursting with fresh cut green onions it almost made my eyes water, shar earthy garlic spiciness kicks in as well. Biscuit malts slip through and let you realize there's some malt balance going on. Flavor was just rough for me, blast of strong booze from the highe abv, minimal hop bitterness a bit sweet actually, but the hop flavors that came through didn't sit right with me green onion and garlic in my beer doesn't work, well maybe if it was Mama Mia's Pizza Beer. Mouthfeel is rough as well alcohol doesn't go down smooth I don't like a burn with my DIPA. This one sears the nose hairs, carbonation was moderate and body was fuller no a bit resinous and oily with the Summit additions. Drinkability overall too much booze and onion/garlic Summit hops to equate to a good experience for me, not my cup of tea. I will stear clear based of this one can."
"Drinkability isn't outstanding, but it is tasty and bold. I like the unique exclusive use of this hop, which makes this beer like nothing I've had before. For the price I wouldn't be stocking my fridge with it, but I'm glad I got a chance to have a can."
"D: This is definitely one of the most drinkable imperial IPA's I've ever had. I could have a couple of these in a sitting, which I would certainly classify as sessionable for an imperial IPA."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is just a touch low. The alcohol is not well hidden once this comes to temp. Overall, a pretty solid example of a DIPA. Skal."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Slick and oily feel. Lightly carbonated. Full body. A little sweet actually. Surprising."
"Gubna's actually not a bad DIPA, and I'm actually semi-fond of the much-maligned oniony flavor imparted by its summit hops. The price tag, however, is way too high to inspire me to seek out another can. It's good, but not $16 per six-pack good."
"Drinkability: Overall, I really like this beer. Its not a top tier DIPA, but I really enjoyed it. Sorry to all of you who think this tastes like onion or garlic-- sucks to be you."
"D - drinkability is good but the 10% abv will kick your ass in a hurry."
"Clear, golden in color with about a 1/2""" head that dissipated soon after pouring. The clarity revealed fewer bubbles than expected, which also disappeared quickly. A very potent aroma of citrus, pine, floral and alcohol wafted up from the glass/can soon after pouring. There are flavors of orange and other citrus fruits, with a prickly mouthfeel followed by the warmth of 10% a.b.v. This is not a mouth-puckering IPA that just resonates with dry, resiny hops. It's much lighter in body and brings citrus flavors. After letting it warm up a bit more on an 85 degree evening, it showed a creamier texture and some baked bread flavors. This would be a great food beer--Thai comes to mind."
"After having alleged DIPA Double Crooked Tree last night, this hop bomb was just what the doctor ordered. Apparently a polarizing beer, Gubna is right up my alley. Keep on doing what you're doing, Oskar Blues!"
"D- This is kind of a strange beer. Im glad I got to try it and see what all the fuss is about."
"D: Not the greatest but good. Not terribly drinkable due to ABV and PRICE!! I'm pretty sure those things are correlated though."
"Overall a decent double IPA. It's a bit too expensive for regular drinking, but at this strength, it's really for a special occasion. Be warned: One can is more than enough, unless you want to suffer the consequences."
"Kind of a let down on the taste. Smell is great."
"D- I guess I'll say its ok to drink. Something about this one didn't totally turn me on. I'd probably try this one again if I have the chance but I think there are better ones out there."
"This is a very nice DIPA, much more complex than anticipated, and a very well-balanced example of the style. Enough hops to satisfy even the most dedicated hophead, but with a lot of sweetness and malt to balance it out. One of the better DIPAs I've had lately, if not ever."
"O: Overall I did not like this beer. It has great character: the initial hop aroma and taste, but the aftertaste of garlic severely detracts from the overall enjoyment for me."
"100 IBU and 10% ABV? You'd never know it, so drinkable. The real bothersome thing about this beer is that its almost always between 100-200 days old when you look at the date stamp."
"A complex, challenging palate to this one. A definite change of pace compared to others in the style. I'm not convinced that summit is the best hops for a single hop IIPA though. It is supposed to have a citrus profile from what I've read but I barely got more than a hint of that in here. Pleasant, but a bit over the top."
"Wow this is a strange brew. Definitely can scratch this one off my list. This beer is best described by the word that crowns the top of this can """disestablishmentarian""" An opponent of an established order. This beer is big time out of the box!"
"The ten ounce pour was a task upon itself. This easily ranks as the worst IIPA I've had. Unspeakably terrible. You'd have to pay me to drink this again."
"Clear deep gold body, multiple streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. A bit less than a full finger of small bubble white head, with fairly significant lacing running down the side of glass. Malt forward in the nose, caramel and breadiness nicely balanced, with spicy hops leading to a sharp bitter finish. Taste is sweet up front, almost sugary, not so much citrusy or melons, more like cane sugar, with a full-mouth feel and bitter finish, but not too sharp, the sweetness cuts into the hop presence. I don't think pounding these back is a good idea at this ABV, and it's a bit too sugary sweet for my liking, but this does taste good and is most certainly worth giving a try. Recommended."
"Might be tempted to order this one from time to time, despite the sweetness and 10% abv."
"My coworker told me I had to try this IIPA and since I've enjoyed everything else OB has offered, I thought it would be a no-brainer. Wow, what a shock! It smells like a ripe grapefruit and whets the tastebuds with the typical IIPA aromas. Let's taste it! What??? Onions and garlic! Wild! Grapefruit, hoppy spice, and a savory onion/garlic follow-through. Nothing like it. I would recommend enjoying this IIPA with a tasty burger and an order of frings... Awesome combination."
"while i love summit hops, the GUBNA isn't my favorite, and at the same price as TEN-FIDY, it's really not worth it for me to keep buying these. definitely props to OB for what they're doing, though."
"Gubna is a pretty unique IIPA. I really loved the hop bitterness, but the malt bill was a bit strange for me. I would say Gubna is worth a try, but at the price Oskar Blues cans command around here, I would leave Gubna on the shelf and grab a different IIPA, or perhaps a 4 pack of Ten Fidy instead."
"I think I prefer Gordon just a little more since it comes out a bit more dry. This beer feels intentionally under attenuated."
"Normally, I would prefer a more citrusy character, but I enjoyed this. It is """dangerously""" drinkable... Different, but well-balanced and very smooth for the abv, with an interesting aroma and taste. Get a can!"
"Pours a slightly hazy toasted straw color with a small creamy off-white head that left some clingy lace. The aroma is pleasant, not a strong hop aroma but solid. There is a very fresh, buddy hop aroma, which I like. It is like I am smelling a bag of fresh hops or weed. The taste is of a pale malt a touch of sour from the rye, not overly sweet which is nice, a bit bready. The hop profile has some grapefruit and tropical fruit notes, there is some grass and pepper as well. The feel is of a huge malt body, very heavy on the palate but not overly sweet. There is good hop flavor with no ridiculous bitterness. There is a bit of an odd creamy texture to the beer due to the malt presence. Amazing that this beer is 100 IBU's with the bitterness so well hidden It is also amazing that with such a heavy malt body that this brew is not that sweet. An interesting DIPA. Definitely big pale malt presence and hoppy flavor. I didn't get huge bitterness or sweetness which is nice. The feel is a bit odd and the ABV is there so it limits the drinkability."
"overall - balanced beer, enjoyable but the hop was slightly strange. Would drink again but would not search it out."
"Overall, an interesting beer that keeps me on my toes. Loved it the first couple times then really didn't like then middle of the road then liking again. Really have to be in a certain mood for this one it seems. Recommend at least a single can if you can just to try something very unique. Available here in TX in limited quantities so got several 4 paks. Rotation - got several in the fridge to last me for a bit then probably done with it unless I really fall in love with it. At $17/4pk, it's too pricey to be on the fence about. [O;O]"
"I now have vidalia onion breath."
"D- Quite drinkable despite the outrageous flavor. The texture really helps."
"D: The beer is ok, not too drinkable, but it's not awful. A bit too extreme for my tastes, it started out ok, but I found it sort of hard to choke down a whole can of this."
"this was served too cold straight from the tap, so i can't be the best judge of the aroma. it was pretty mellowed from the temperature; i got no garlic, but none of the pleasant IPA hop/floral aroma either. flavor: """this one tastes like the IPA got into an onion patch.""" the high ABV isn't terribly overwhelming, but the aftertaste is anything but clean. the more this warmed up, the less i liked it. that makes me think it would have been worse if it hadn't started out too cold. just seems totally out of whack, so i was pretty psyched that my sample was $6 glass instead of a $15+ four-pack."
"Unusual? YES! But it works. Great job by the guys at Oskar Blues. Drink is far outside the box but quite enjoyable. Gubna's a winner!"
"I love single hop performances. And Oskar Blues definitely knew what they were doing with this one. Lot of love, lots of hate, but more importantly, lots of discussion. This brew was a success."
"D: Drinkability was a bit odd, but somewhat intriguing enough to keep you guessing and puzzled as to its oddity. Not nearly as bad as some people made it out to be. A four pack is perfect for conversation and discussion among friends for this much talked about ipa. Worth the price for to experience the first time around, but the chance of repeatability is low as well not really a session or summer time quencher."
"Overall, this is a very interesting DIPA. I like that Oskar Blues is trying to branch out a bit with the style. I don't think I'll drink this too often, but it is definitely worth trying and a beer that I will probably try again in the future."
"Overall not one I would come back to again and again, but it was worth a try. Definitely one of the standout IPAs I've had."
"Thanks to the guy at DLD who first poured me some in line... it piqued my interest for sure."
"Drinkability? I just can't handle the taste of this beer so it is very low. I will not buy again but I see others like it or love it. More power to ya."
"Pours sunny orange with lively head. Aroma is sweet and orangy, like orange candy. Flavor is a hoppy bomb, with a grassy attack and a chewy, grapefuitlike middle, and a piny and citric finish. Throughout is sweet and candylike. The mouthfeel is viscous and clings, emphasizing the citrus bitterness that sticks high on the mouth. The feel is prickly with carbonation over a creamy creamcicle character."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"Pours a very nice slightly hazy golden dark yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice thick creamy one-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is a big hop note, nice malt balance, citrus, and pine notes. The taste is hoppy, sweet, nice malt note, good dose of citrus, and pine notes. Medium body, pretty chewy, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Very drinkable, this one really surprised the shit out of me, another very tasty brew from Oskar."
"This wasn't in my notes, but I'll point out that even my mom liked this beer, and she is not anywhere near the hop-head that I am."
"Appearance was pale with moderate lacing. The smell was citrusy and floral (reminds me of the nose on a Stone Ruination). The taste is big and bitter. Definitely over 100 IBUs, but a simple hop taste. Heavy grapefruit citrus flavor. Slight sweetness on the finish (honey?). Mouthfeel is oily and lingers. Quite drinkable for 10%abv. Overall I'm not ready to put it in a category with Pliny or Hopslam, but this is a pretty damn good beer."
"The flavor is similarly balanced between positive and negative. I love the pithy, in-your-face deliciousness of the hops. Two tons of Summit. That said, the one-note pony (mixing metaphors) can only hobble so far, and the syrupy mouthfeel and abundance of diacetyl-buttery flavor calls the dogs off to new prey."
"Drinks easy for the strength & style, but not in love with the hops used here. Probably one of my least favorite OB offerings"
"Love Oscar Blues. Could live on Dale's Pale and Gordon. Now this beer is something else. It is truly disgusting. Blue cheese was the first smell. It followed on the palette. It looks ok and the mouthfeel could be worse. But I poured three quraters down the drain, so I have to give it a 1 for drinkability. They let me buy one can only at the store, and for that I am grateful."
"The taste is very sweet and any bitterness in there is covered by it. The aromoa mixed with that sweetness isnt that easy to drink. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Seems to loose some of the funk after a few sips. Which makes me think I should try this again to see if I can get past the nose shock. We'll see..."
"Not a beer I'd have again. I was suprised to see it rate so high. At first, I thought I would try it again just in case I got a bad can, but considering that others noted the onion/garlic taste too, I'll pass."
"I rather liked this and enjoyed it's overall tangy and earthy profile from that mix of Summit hops and rye. I didn't really get any of the strange flavors that many other reviewers seem to have gotten but I can understand that some different stuff might come out from that mix of ingredients. Also, I drank several of these fresh in late March and the ABV was very nicely hid. Had some more a few weeks later and this was already showing much more alcohol than before. Best get this one uber-fresh when you can find it."
"Drinkability: tasty, but the solid amount of flavor really hits you in the fact. The alcohol is hitting me pretty hard, as well. I think this is a good one, but I wouldn't want to make a session of it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth, even carbonation."
"My pour created two fingers' worth of yellowish-white foam that burbled and popped like a chemistry experiment. Color was a slightly hazy golden-amber. Nose was definitely funky, kind of cheddar cheesy overlain by an earthy grassiness. I CAN understand where others noted onions, but none of this bothers me. I seek out craziness where others may drainpour or otherwise shy away. Mouthfeel was fairly full with a riot of funky flavors in the mouth - I remember the first time I smelled aged hops and thought, """WTF, over?""" This was much like that. Cheesy, oniony, earthy (like fresh turned soil), wow! The finish had a definite onion quality to it, but it was not a deterrent. Instead, I allowed the 10% ABV to seep into my addled brain and leave me feeling real good. The lacing in the glass would need a jackhammer to remove it. Good. Something else to fill the idle hours."
"D - dont see what all the (bad) fuss is about. wasnt picking up any """rotting vegetable""" or onion that some other people described. just a well done (and somewhat unique) DIPA. to each his own."
"Kind of disappointed with the Gubna, I was excited to try it since I had heard great things when it came out. The 10% is nowhere to be found though."
"D- After the first can I think I was over the taste and needed to move on but I did think that it was an interesting beer to be tried once. Too one sided on this beer, I like DIPA's but this was too sweet for me. Enjoyed the different taste but will not search out regularly."
"Overall, I wanted to give this beer lower number scores, but I'm trying to be fair. I cannot recommend this beer. Again, Oskar Blues, it's time for you to put down the bong and focus on your beer."
"Overall - Didn't do much for me, particularly for the money."
"This is a love it or hate it beer. The garlic is understated at first but begins to build although it never really completely takes over. That locker room smell really stuck with me though. I swear I would catch a whiff from time to time an hour later. I've heard it's a different experience on tap and would be willing to try it again. By the can it is certainly a unique experience, just one I won't be looking to repeat."
"To me the Summit hops are the highlight of Gubna, but also the biggest misstep in this beer. I think if OB's would have used another hop to help balance the Summit, this one could have been a Contender! Still a very solid DIPA though that I enjoyed. But at the same time I can see how this is a polarizing brew."
"Served in a Sams Adams glass. No hint of carbonation with the opening of the can, although the light amber colored brew develops some fizz with the pour. Aroma is primarily hops, not overwhelming. Taste is a pleasant hoppy brew; strong, a little bit fruity but not super-bitter. Aftertaste is a little strange with a strong alcohol presence. Enjoyable beer, but I'd still rather have a Ten Fidy."
"D - If you don't like garlic and onions, a lot, then you probably won't like this beer. I like both, so it's okay in my book. I may even buy it again sometime. It certainly isn't your average DIPA, and I can see why some people would hate it."
"A can split at the Pizza Port bottle shop, courtesy of Overlord. The beer is golden orange with a frothy white head, decent retention, and scattered lacing. The nose exhibits pine, grapefruit, and a caramel malt backing. Alcohol is evident, and there's an abominable onion presence. The taste is of grapefruit and pine with some caramel malt and a big astringent onion kick. The onion flavor is rancid. When Overlord went to look in the coolers I snuck over to the sink and poured the remainder down the sink. Avoid. This is one of the worst DIPAs I've ever had."
"Mouthfeel was probably ok but since it tasted like crap...who cares???? Drinkability is bad....I drain poured the last quarter of the can. I don't think it was a defective can...Maybe something happened in storage or it was a bad batch, but I will wait till next year if and when I try it again. Very disappointing."
"I don't know how much Gubna I will drink, as the price isn't really on the mark for me, but I am glad I tried this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy, however there's a sugary slickness as well that I didn't really like. Overall, a middle of the road DIPA. I don't think it's horrible but it also doesn't leave me desiring more."
"D- I'm not one hundred percent sold on this beer. It is good don't get me wrong but I think they should have gone with a different hop. Will try this again but I can see why this beer is a love it or hate it beer. Glad I got to try though."
"D: OK. Too green and garlicky. Vampires beware."
"D - Really unique DIPA with a bold citrusy character and plenty of spicy and catbox notes. The alcohol remains quite restrained for a 10% ABV, which makes it that much easier to throw back."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is slightly below average. A very good mouthfeel for the style overall. Drinkability isn't that great for me, one was plenty and don't see myself buying another anytime soon. It wasn't bad but it was a little high in alcohol flavor and hot for a hoppy beer. The hop flavors were pretty good but it could have been better. The 100% Summit hop just didn't do it for me."
"Drinkability: Chalk me up on the side of those who like this brew; sure, it's a little different but that is a good thing to me"
"D - I thought it was good can't wait to have another at 10% ABV maybe just not too many."
"I really enjoyed this beer, even with its big price tag and wierd single hop overload. Bitter, but not rough, balanced with a pleasing blend of honey and fruit flavors, and an obvious but not overwhelming alcohol kick. My idea of a great DIPA, but clearly not for everyone. A lovely treat."
"No, just no. This is terrible. A complete train-wreck, in my opinion. With the exception of the appearance, almost nothing fits the style; it doesn't even work if you think of it as any other style. I feel compelled to finish this out, but I've been contemplating a drain pour since the second sip. It's a chore to finish."
"D - This is good but not great. I'd rather drink their Gordon for a DIPA."
"It's hard to believe that Oskar Blues sells a ton of this stuff. It's just too 'out there' with respect to flavor. These guys can some amazing ales, but this ain't one of them. If the suggestion box is open... impeach the GUBNA!"
"D- Either you love this beer or you hate it. I wouldn't run to buy another four pack."
"This is a wild beer. If you like hops you have to love it, or do you?"
"D- Not a bad beer, but not the hops that I'm craving for now."
"So far I have loved everything I have tried from OB. But this one was a swing and a miss."
"D: I can definitely see how this beer is so divisive. Aside from everything else, it is so assertive that it demands a response and it can be hard to not respond extremely to a brew this extreme. I would recommend anyone trying this just for the sake of trying it as it, in my opinion, really shows how surprising a beer can be. Definitely a WTF moment in beer tasting for me, and I can happily say that this chalks up to another OB success in my book."
"Overall there isn't anything terribly wrong this beer but the flavor profile just isn't hitting any high notes with me. I do appreciate how smooth the bitterness is though since that is one of the things that can win me over with a DIPA."
"For an DIPA this is a very drinkable beer and very unique. I Dont know if I have ever tasted a beer like this."
"Sold in 4 packs for 15.99...for all the hype this beer got on this site it didnt live up to much of it."
"Eh. Glad I got the one. Won't bother buying that pack after-all. Especially for the price."
"Been looking forward to trying this one since OB is one of my top 3 breweries and it didn't disappoint. The hops may have faded the past 2 weeks since it was canned but I don't see them fading that much. I didn't think it smelled like weed in a can like some people have posted. It really reminded me of Alpine Nelson with the apricot smell and taste."
"Note: This is a strange score because I'm rating Taste at 4.0 but Drinkability at 5.0. I thought the hops and malts clashed a bit which is why I 4'ed the taste but this beer went down in gulps. It is so smooth and the hop dryness just keeps it going."
"Drinkability: This is a bit of a one trick pony. The weird flavors really prevent this beer from being too drinkable. A beer you should try, but probably won't return to."
"The hops lay the smack down on the palate, and it's a beautiful, bitter burn as the alcohol kicks in. Raw, leafy Summit hops add a very flavorful balance to all the IBU's, with pine resin and wild herbs. The malts taste sweet and pale with a spicy rye kick, but ultimately get overshadowed by the hoppy onslaught. The booze takes hold mid-palate, and grips the tastebuds with a breathy ethanol note until the 10% ABV warms the stomach. One of the longest-lingering aftertastes in recent memory, and I like it. Mouthfeel is deceptively light and drinkable, but you can tell this is a big beer all the while. I guess the uppity carbonation level helps lighten the load. All in all, a fantastic IIPA from Oskar Blues. I was a bit skeptical of the all-Summit hop schedule and hefty price-tag, but this is well worth the asking price. Yum!"
"This isn't especially easy to drink, but still enjoyable for sure."
"Pours somewhat hazy gold at first but clears somewhat to a medium golden color. Quite the resiny and piney tree sap aroma. Just a huge hop blast upfront. Deep resiny and piney flavors. A ton of sweetness in the finish with a mild spicy bite. Long lasting hop flavors. Huge body-fairly heavy, quite viscous. A hell of a DIPA-thoroughly enjoyable on all levels. Will revisit this again and again."
"Overall, this was an odd dipa. Nothing I really enjoyed too much. It had some interesting flavors with it and showed too much of its alcohol. Glad I only have one can to get through."
"drinkability: let down witht he hype, but still a great DIPA"
"I know some people are really digging this beer, but I think Oskar Blues could've benefitted from diversifying their hops and toning down the residual sugar from the malt bill."
"I would heartily recommend pairing this particular beer with food. I hold no illusion that I would want a pint of this coming in on a warm spring afternoon (they're warm here in SoCal). But it worked amazingly well with the meal I paired it with."
"D- Overall, this is a big hop dominated DIPA that packs a lot of hops. Don't know if I'd want more than one can though, that would be palate overload for me."
"D= Decent brew. When you get use to the onion taste it's decent. There are a lot of better IIPAs that are at a more reasonable price point. Decent beer though."
"Definitely worth picking up."
"Drinkability is high because it's not cloying and it's not a palate-wrecker. 10%, $15 4-pack, I don't know that it would be a beer I'd seek out again. I'll enjoy the other 3 however..."
"I might give it 5's across the board if it was in a bottle."
"4/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"D-I'm not fan of Surly Abrasive as I think that has similar characteristics as this one but this is much worse. Probably the worst tasting DIPA I have had. Will never buy again."
"The feel is a little tough for the unprepared and can be really a shock if you are inexperienced with high bitter IPAs. This beer is well carbonated and a bit effervescent. IT is pretty drinkable once you are used to the bitterness and does down well. Some nice bitter aftertaste that stays for about five to ten seconds after each sip. A good bitter, Imperial IPA."
"Big thank you goes out to Lloyd for thinking of me and picking this up while in Co. Beautiful hazy orange pour with a big fine white head, that leaves nice lacing. Sticky. Good. Pleasant fruity aroma, kind of earthy. Strong. Big citrus hop front with a nice malt back bone. I would compare this to a modus hoperandi if it came in an imperial style. Look out for this one, its one strong brew. It hits you from the start. I had three glasses from the growler in three hours and had to call it a night."
"Pours a dark amber with a disappointing thin white head, not much lace. Smell: earthy with some cantaloupe and mild tropical fruit. Taste: mild toffee sweetness, spicy, earthy, a little alcohol and a touch of pineapple aftertaste. Syrupy. Alcohol and earthy/spicy linger. This one was a lot better cool, as it warmed it got earthy and """green""" tasting (Summit I assume)."
"D: Because of the high ABV, I could only do about 2 of these before I fall out of my chair. Still, a sessionable DIPA, though I think I want to underestimate this because it comes in a can."
"D - This is a very nice DIPA that delivers in the way one tends to expect from OB. The hop character is both complex (shockingly complex for a beer brewed with a single hop) and extremely pungent with a particularly spicy leaning. This hop intensity is mirrored in the flavor with strong notes of grapefruit and other, more subtle hop characteristics that combine well with the rich malt. This combination of malt and hops comes together particularly well in the finish and aftertaste, where it creates a woody tobacco character that highlights the moderately toasty notes of the malt. A nice new offering from Oscar Blues and well worth seeking out."
"Finish is hoppy and resiny, not that thrilled with the aftertaste ofthis, really overwhelms he rest of the beer."
"D: Overall this a decent beer. When you factor in the price though this is a only buy once type of beer. I think one at a time is all I can due because it does have some funkiness going on."
"This poured a nearly clear gold with some off-white head. It smelled like strong pine with some apricot and floral hops, plus light caramel malt. It tasted just about the same as it smelled, like pine with floral and apricot hops, and some caramel malt. It was thick with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had huge hops but was still somehow very well balanced, leading to a great scent and taste. It had great body also, and hid the alcohol all too well, so it was dangerously easy to drink. A wonderful double IPA that shows a mastery of extracting a ton of taste from a single hop. And while this is a gem when fresh, the malt backbone seemed strong enough to make it a very interesting candidate for aging."
"P.S. This bad boy is only 12 days old! Fresh as a can can be."
"12oz. can served in my DT tulip. Poured a translucent golden orange with a creamy, 2.5 inch off-white head. Head eventially settles into a fairly consistent skim of a cap that coalesces around the shoulders. Lots of lacing with excellent adherence on this brew. Nose starts off with citrus notes initially, but there seems to be a slightly herbal/medicinal quality that follows close behind, as well as perhaps a hint of something vegetal - garlic and/or onions? Taste consistent with nose - WTF - there is something a little off-putting about the taste for me. Another review cited a Funyuns taste. While it's been years since I've had a Funyun, there is definitely an overpowering oniony/garlicky character to this beer that comes out in the middle and peaks at the end as a not so subtle reminder of what you just tasted - all this on a very malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and syrupy viscous with an even carbonation level. All these factors, coupled with the price, makes Gubna a major swing and a miss for me. Very disappointing considering the quality of the other OB beers."
"** had the opportunity to try this on tap @ sunswick in astoria and went for it, hoping it would taste better than it did from the cans - it did not..."
"Big disappointment obviously... Wanted to be one of those that fell in love with yet another OB offering but this one missed the mark in my book..."
"Taste and poor warming qualities made this hard for me to finish."
"This is a very good beer. A bit unusual, but I like the change of pace. The only problem is the price... $15 for a 4 pack is way too steep for me to buy again."
"D: I am enjoying this beer but it is expensive. We got the 4 pack in NJ for $15 but it showed up around here for 17.99. For 15 I would grab it once in a while. For 18..."
"This is an interesting take on the style, but the onion takes some getting used to."
"D - I was perplexed by this, too bitter to be drinkable for bitterness' sake and has lack of depth beyond the herbal grassy quality and strong malt/alcohol to be truly drinkable for me. The IIPA seems strange and the single Summit usage doesn't win me over in this style- I would say try it, but it isn't the best example of the style"
"D - As much as I'm loving this beer, I don't see myself drinking more that two of these... mostly because it's DIPA, but still very drinkable."
"D: Too thin and too carbonated, one and done for me."
"d - it's not horrible by any means but i'm a little disappointed as i usually love everything that oskar blues brews and this isn't up to par. many dipas i prefer over this one."
"Summit hops lend their mark to the palate; there's a distinct onion-like quality to this beer, but it's matched by pineapple and sweet papaya. This is very tropical, spicy, decidedly sweet, though not terribly viscous given the high ABV. Rye is evident, melding with the hops to create a pronounced spiciness not dissimilar to fresh rye bread with garlic spread. The finish has a firm bitterness which borders on, but never quite reaches, astringency. It's quite juicy, never really reaching the dryness of a West Coast IPA, but also lacking a heavy malt profile, with a hop bitterness that's intensely resiny, like sucking on pine sap. Unique, enjoyable, though not necessarily remarkable. It's worth a try."
"this is really world class beer. An I woulda even given it better cept fo the grapefruit thang. Served with a nice off white head and good lace. Color is a clear 18k gold amber. Aroma is major hops with good malt and a little fruit. Interesting thing about this beer is although it has the grapefruit thing going on, it's tempered by a reduction of acid and a slight boost of sugar. Makes it chewier, less coy, and a much better brew all around. Great body and finish- in fact, perfect for the style. Finish is quite rich and so only a slow sipper. Not a session."
"Overall, this beer is pretty strange. When I first had it on tap, it was much different and better. The hops were much fruitier and more resiny without the weird stinky earth notes (also described by people I'm with as """catty""" and """armpit"""). The last time I was there (Longmont location), it tasted the same on tap as it has in the bottles. I can only guess that there's a difference in batches, and I've heard that Summit hops can be unusual and hit or miss. It's very strange but I still kinda like it."
"The beer pours a clear medium yellow color with a white head. The aroma is orange and pine hops at first, with some resiny and catty hops showing up as well. The flavor is similar but the catty hops are much more dominant. The bitterness is about medium and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice DIPA, but at the price this sells for, I wouldn't buy it again."
"My first DIPA in a can, and I enjoy it. I had Obliteration VI a few months ago so an imperial IPA using only Summit hops isn't new to me, although I'm not quite sold on Summit hops for a single hop ale, but it could work in combination with others. Still this is a fine brew, and I'd certainly pick it up again."
"D - Mehh. If this was $1.00 to $1.75 per can instead of $4.00 per can, I would pick it up again. There are so many DIPAs readily available for me, this will not be a repeat. Too sweet and WAY too fruity. It is surprisingly smooth, for 10%abv. I did not detect much, if any alcohol."
"Seeing the mixed reviews of this beer,I was almost hesitent to buyit,but alas I did.Poured into a tulip glass a clear bronze with a fluffy one finger white head that never really fades completely.Hmm the hop aromas are a bit different,there is a resinous quality,but like a few others have stated there is a """meaty""" quality to it wich is odd,also I pick up some leather wich I normally wouldnt find in a DIPA.wow the flavors are very odd,the Summit hop gives off an odd flavor,its gotta green leafiness to it and a weird kind of fruitiness as well,its a bit prickly and not fun to drink really.Hmm this is different in a not so good kinda way."
"D: Good, loads of hops, more IPA like than DIPA."
"2014: 3/17 can consumed 3/21 - 4 days old! Lovely dank weed nose. Sweet citrus and honeyed hop juice spread across nose and palate. Quite bitter, but enjoyably so. At it's juiciest and most pungent best on the nose, vivid and alive. Resinous. Floral tropical fruits - really packs it all in. Alcohol keeps contained. Very nice."
"This beer is definitely all it sets out to be - an assertive hop blast, well balanced by spicy, independently assertive malts. Still, it's a bit much (and a bit high in alcohol) to try and session."
"D - I'm torn between giving drinkability a 3.5 and 4 as it could potentially be drinkable for the percent and the flavor but right now I'm not feeling it as much as I was at the beginning. Another great beer in a can though!"
"Notes: This beer is delicious just like every otehr Oskar Blues beer I've had. I like Gordon better overall, but this is an awesome IIPA. Even at the price I will be buying more of this."
"Not too bad at all...a little intense and syrupy, but the nose is really awesome. Alcohol is very intense, and even extreme when fully decanted. It is unrefined and maybe seems a little sloppy, but serious potential."
"D: The nitrogen really didn't add much to the ale. If anything, it made the ale more palatable by reducing the sharpness of carbonation. A good DIPA but I've not no problem curling up with a can of Dale's."
"D: Very drinkable, this one melded the flavors together really well and it wasn't as big feeling as it is, nice masking of the alcohol and mixing of the flavors."
"not worth the moola, incredibly drinkable for the style but lacks the flavor punch of many others which can be had at better prices. heck, Gordon trumps this by a mile."
"D: Meh...I expected a lot more, and am a little let down. I don't think a second can would e enjoyable. Overall not a bad DIPA though, it just lacks some of the substance thait a Pliny, or even a DuganA has. Really reminds me of my most recent homebrew. The summit hop is a decent one, but I don't think it is appropriate for use as a single hop. Applaud the effort, but not overly impressed."
"Drinking this after a moderately spicy Indian meal, the onion and garlic character of this hop are hidden quite well. I'll have to try this on a clean palate to see what I think."
"D - Very easy to drink with some nice flavor but I'm not sure it's worth the $14.99 I paid for it ($16+ with tax)."
"d- from the first sip i knew i was going to struggle to put this one down but i mean this was rough. ill give a round of applause for oskar blues for trying something different here but i think its a failure in my eyes. way too malty and sweet, tons of hops, NO FRUIT taste or smell what so ever and just way too foresty. maybe i just like my ipa's hoppy and fruit not like im trying to survive in the woods by eating the needles of a tree..."
"Edit: Had this a few more times since then and i definitly see where the bad comments come from. The last one i had tasted like onion creek skunk weed from norcal. Not very good in a beer can. I just think they have some serious consistancy issues that they need to iron out and this will be a great beer."
"Canned on 4/8/10 so exactly a week ago (the OB distributor came through for once), and pours an amberish golden color, with a thick beige head that retains well and leaves impressive lacing. The smell is immediately impressive as you can smell this sucker from a mile away, with big piney, citrusy, fruity, and floral hop notes, along with some caramel, rye, biscuit, fruity esters, and a little alcohol...truly amazing aroma here. The flavor is not quite as impressive as the aroma, with a huge hops blast upfront (consisting of citrus and pineapple, and a little pine resin and grass character), along with some bread dough and caramel, fruity ale esters, and a wallop of alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and rich but not syrupy, and drinkability is decent despite the massive bitterness. Really enjoyed this one, though the aroma made a promise that the flavor couldn't deliver upon. Very nice beer from OB, easily my favorite of their lineup."
"This is a good offering, but not one I'd pay the price for often. Love the cans though."
"So I've got three more cans left... I think that they might be destined to be trade extras. This is worth trying once. Drinking a scallion & grass & malt-that-tastes-like-the-honey-biscuits-from-Church's-Chicken flavored beer is sort of fun for half a glass. I should have bought a 4-pack of Gordon instead."
"Overall a real disappointment. Honestly, the more OB stuff I have the more disappointed I get. Their only true winner to me is Gordan, the rest of their stuff I can leave. Sorry OB, you missed on this one."
"Overall this has perhaps the most unique flavor profile of any DIPA I have had to date. There is some bizarre stuff going on, but overall, I like it. Recommended."
"D: A drinkable, if somewhat unusual beer."
"D: this is an in your face DIPA and is quite unique. Lots of funky flavors that I wouldn't expect in an IPA, and its hoppy as hell."
"I don't think I'll have more than 1 or 3 in a row."
"I poured from a 12 ounce can into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a hazy red/orange with a solid 2 finger head. Lots of pine and citrus in the aroma, some candy like sweetness also. The taste follows the nose, sweet grapefruit and pine. The sweet finish sticks around for a bit. The beer is medium to full bodied and has a sticky mouthfeel. A friend recomended this one and he was right, a very good DIPA."
"A bit light. Offputting."
"Drinkability: The alcohol tinge and the abv hold it back."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange, with almost no head, what head there is is white. The nose is great, pine, orange peel, with a little caramel. The taste borders on exceptional, bitter, biscuit malt, piney, orange peel, well separated flavors and nothing out of balance, real impressive. The mouthfeel is great, it is like a pale ale, light and refreshing and somehow this beer is 10%ABV, amazing. It is way too drinkable for this level of alcohol."
"D: Drinkability is low for me on this beer. The onions/grassy taste as the beer warms just kill it for me. If the beer retained its cold characteristics throughout the whole beer it would be much better."
"D- ABV creeps up on you relatively fast, but the taste of it is good enough to keep me coming back for more. A pretty good beer overall. Definitely not my favorite DIPA but it's also not my least favorite. Thanks again brees6221!"
"D - Big beer and big flavors, but high drinkability for the style."
"D: not bad given the abv. be careful with this one. You think its a good sitting on the porch in the sun beer because you forget how much alcohol is in it."
"Clear, orange-amber body, craggy large head, and steady carbonation made for an attractive looking beer. The smell was intensely citric and succulent. The hops came through in the taste as up front bitter and spicy flavors, and the malt backbone was solid with a candy like sweetness. Quite sticky in the mouth with a lingering spicy aftertaste. No frills construction, but does not need any gimmicks to stand up to the completion."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, this is a very solid and different IPA, might be one that grows on me with more time."
"D: This legit tastes like straight scallions. The two times i have tried it now are enough"
"The roasted nut quality of GUBNA is odd and less than pleasant. I make a breakfast shake every morning and on the rare occasion I throw flax seed into it, the flax seed totally overpowers the flavor in a bad way. GUBNA has that quality and it's rather odd. This is no threat to the fantastic Gordon."
"A distinctive take on the style, though single-hop IPAs (especially imperial strength) often end up more interesting than good. Definitely worth a try, even if it doesn't end up a staple in your fridge."
"Gubna (dumb name) seems to be a love or hate beer, and I'm not quite sure why. Yes, it's intense and devilish, but isn't that what an imperial IPA is supposed to be? For me it was love at first sip, and this one, my third in about a week, is pushing all the right buttons. And it comes in a can, no less...will wonders never cease?"
"Very smooth, especially for an Imperial IPA, and it flows over the palate effortlessly. However, if you aren't a fan of summit hops, stay away from this one or drink it quickly while it is cold. The onion bagel character makes it a little difficult to finish. Summit hops should just go away and not come back."
"D: The alcohol is hefty, and the flavors don't really work together. A big disappointment. I will be drinking a lot of Gordon to make up for this experience."
"D - Very good beer, wish a four pack wasn't $16+"
"D: Suprisingly well for such a strong beer."
"Woof. I don't know what some of the reviewers are drinking, but it's not the same beer (I mean it probably is, but you know). I split the can with a hop-head friend and she poured it down the drain after a few sips. The vegetable and meat aroma and flavor overpower anything pleasant or reasonable in this beer. Really, it reminds me of the arugula salad I get at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. And while it's a tasty salad, it's nothing I want to drink. The one good thing I can say is that the body is very drinkable for the style. Now if it only tasted good too, we'd be on to something."
"D: This is the most unique beer that I have had of the style. It's extremely complex in the taste and the nose .... but yet brewed with only summit hops ( to the best of my knowledge). WTF - one type of hops shouldn't madden me so with picking out what it is bringing to the table! I enjoy it immensely but is a beer that would be far better paired with food then one to sit with for a sessionable beer."
"D-this is a hop bomb, the only way an imperial ipa should be. Extremely good and will please that pine thirst and bitter finish that we hop heads can grow to love!"
"D: DISAPPOINTING. Such hype, and this is what we get? I drove 45 minutes to a store that had this beer and definitely won't do it again. The funky onion thing really takes away from the experience. I normally like tropical hop flavors, but somehow this one doesn't work. I'll try it again just to make sure I didn't get a bad batch, but not impressed so far."
"Very good DIPA in my opinion. Still pretty easy to drink for 10% and big on flavor."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but I really can't see myself drinking more than one of these in an evening. It's worth a try if you see it on the shelf, but don't go making a special trip for it."
"drinkability - is it drinkable? yeah. but i would never want to drink an onion bagel with chives now would i? Good beer, decent drinkability, would not have again, esp for 15 for a 4 pack."
"Overall impression: Can't recommend this one. I loves me some palate-wrecking bitterness, but this was just a very odd mishmash of flavors."
"D: I really had a tough time getting past the onion/garlic smell and taste of this beer. I have had MANY IPAs...my favorite style. Some bad IPAs. But never have had an IPA taste this awful. Wow. This is really terrible stuff. I am a fan of Oskar Blues as well...but just have no idea why they decided to brew this beer. Disgusting."
"D: if i wasnt distracted by the xbox it would be drank very easily."
"Great palate, with some hop oils there but nothing too brutal. This adds to the drinkability. Overall I'm a really big fan of this, and not just in the, """Sweet dude, it's like in a can! That's so unpretentious!""" kind of way. A good beer for the slopes, a camping trip, or a volcano boarding session (if you have to ask, you're not extreme, chief)."
"A very interesting beer. Although it will probably receive an average rating, I can not bring myself to label this beer average. It is leaps and bounds from most beers I would call a IIPA yet I do not desire another."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a good sized, white head. Aroma is mostly of onions with some citrus as well. Taste upfront is of a touch of toasted malt, but that quickly gives way to funky onion flavor along with some pine. This is a strange beer. I've had beer that has some onion-like qualaties and it works, this however, does not. Sorry Oskar Blues this is not good."
"D: As many others have pointed out, there is something odd about this beer. Perhaps its the malt complexity just overshadowing the one dimension hops. The massive alcohol presence does not help this beer along."
"D: I don't know what they were trying to do, but I think I can safely say it didn't work. Awful beer, and ridiculously overpriced. Living in CA, I don't see the point in giving it another shot when there are so many other competing DIPAs. Easily bottom-tier for the style."
"It is pretty interesting, but odd. I like the taste much more than the smell. Worth a try."
"It looks like Oscar blues managed to come close to making an Avery Maharaja for half the price. It's a mixed bag, but a pleasure to drink. Probably won't be coming back this way again, because I just don't really like messing with beers over 9%"
"D- Average drinkability. Would I drink this again, for sure. Would I keep it in my stable? probably not. It's a very good beer but the high ABV sure is noticeable and I'd probably take a Dale's over this most days of the week."
"The alcohol is up front and this beer is not something to toss back playing softball. An addition of a bittering hop other than Summit would really turn this beer into something great. It would help balance the aroma, malt and alcohol flavors. I really expect more for the pretty premium price of $3.50 a can - sold in 4 packs."
"D-Good. Interesting approach with the single hop use but I feel this hurts the complexity on the palate. Plus, the alcohol burn diminishes the drinkability for me. This needs to be hidden more in the background and not showcased in the flavour profile. I certainly liked it but in no way did I love it."
"The malt bill is spiced up and completely needed to combat a largely onesided rawish hophouse. It took some getting used to but it works. I love cans and the whole outdoor gig that oskar is employing but this would never be sucked down after a river rafting tour. This is huge bottle jones with a cork and cap type beer. Dot."
"Tasty, funky, unique DIPA, price hurts though..."
"D- Moderate. The hop profile is not terrible but I prefer something a bit more citric and piny, this spicy profile gets tiring quick. Not cheap, either."
"Pours a slightly reddish light amber with minimal head but nice sticky lacing. The aroma is mouthwatering with tons of mandarin orange sweetness, pineapple and other tangy acidic fruits. The nose is also bolstered by a fair amount of malty sweetness that gives the fruits a candied sort of aroma. Initial flavor is quite sweet, sweeter than many doubles, but has a nice bitter edge to it. Similar to the nose this beer drips with citrus and pineapple and has tons of tropical punch character. The more I sip this, the more of the bitterness I get and I am finding it to be one of those beers that gets better as it goes down. I am really not getting any of the garlic notes that so many people speak of, though there are some very interesting flavors that remind me of the hotness of a good raddish. Definitly a complex brew, and I cannot stress how pungent the bouquet is on this bad boy. If it has a downside, I would say it is the mouthfeel. Medium bodied and somewhat slick, yet with a sticky finish that seems to be equal parts sugar and bitterness. Not picking up any alcoholic warmth until it gets in my tum tum. Despite all this is remains quite drinkable and I regard it as a fine new double. I have to say, I came in worrying it would not live up to the hype, but as it turns out this is a beer that you should find and enjoy."
"Can, home. Very good DIPA but not quite up to the best. This beer pours honey gold with a big white head that leaves lots of lacing, ringing the glass as I drink. The aroma is fairly underwhelming for the style, in my opinion. The piney hops are a bit muted, and there are more interesting things going on with the malt - some spice, some grain, all quite nice. For a 10% abv DIPA, I expect more. On the other hand, a lot of the flavors come out quite nicely in the flavor. The hop bitterness is strong but there are complex flavors to it - flowers, pine needles, grapefruit, cannabis. The rye spice is quite good; the general malt flavor is more interesting than most DIPAs. Unfortunately, the beer just doesn't drink as big as its alcohol content would suggest. Knowing how much flavor other brewers can pack into smaller beers, it's a bit disappointing. Otherwise, it's quite good."
"D- Big beer; high alcohol, mountains of hops and with a overly sticky and crazy bitter finish. DUnno if would want more than one, but not a bad DIPA."
"This was not a drain pour but close to it for me. The combination of syrupy sweetness and the funky taste and aftertaste will keep me forever away from this brew."
"Drinkability- Its easy drinking to me but mostly just because its pretty light for the style, its nothing personally that I would be seeking out again as there are just alot of better examples out there, and I know others have said but from what I remember in the past even there cheaper gordon was a bit more complex and enjoyable, it just lacks that aspect that really makes you look down at your glass and say darn thats good and worth remembering, overally simple though I do have to say it did improve a bit as the temperature warmed and really the nose is simply put just to funky and off, I love this company but this is a swing and a miss to me"
"I'm glad I only bought a can. I love DIPAs but this is not not my cup of tea."
"Overall: I guess I'd recommend it to some true hop-head bitterness-seeking IIPA junkie, but this definitely isn't what I'd give a friend to try who didn't already know the style. Maybe in a year or two the edges on this beer with smooth, but consumed fresh, this is a disappointing offering from Oskar Blues whose Dales, Gordon, and even TenFidy (no, I will not admit to liking an Old Chub) are fantastic. C-range."
"I enjoy the uniqueness of this brew. It was easy to finish 1 or 2. However my palate is officail wrecked. I must now go brush the loose enamel off of my teeth that the hops scraped off."
"Overall: A good example of a DIPA...and one I'm going to forward to having again. A must try. Cheers!"
"This is an interesting beer. Some odd aromas and flavors and lots of hops. It could use more balance from the malt and maybe some age to take the edge off the spicy hops."
"Gubna(love the name) pours a hazy golden color with some orange slices mixed in as well. Kinda has a hopslam type hue to it. The head is off white with a medium build but it does not quite stick to the glass. The smell is not as bitter as I was thinking coiming from the 100IBU's. The summit hops used are up front and center at a pretty even pace with the malts used. Some citrus and not alot of pine. 10 percent you say, get out of here. Like the nose the alcohol does not come out in taste at all, I was expecting a little bit, but it's well hidden. Grapefruit, mango, caramel, slight bisquit and and even slighter raw vegetal taste in the finish. The feel is kind of thick like sort of like a watered down oil. The Hop resins are stepping out a little bit. Id say above medium bodied with noticable carb. I would drink this again but wont go out of my way for it. Im not quite sold on GUBNA yet and Im a Mel Brooks fan, so maybe a few more cans will make me see what all the fuss is about."
"D: the beer goes down really smooth especially for 10%. I could down a couple of these while grilling out or anything outside really easy. I would love to taste this on tap because Gordon is super delicious fresh and i think this would be the same."
"Pours a lovely transparent golden with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Strongly hoppy aroma has a hint of citrus. Fiercely hoppy, evergreen flavor has an undertone of sour orange. Smooth yet tingly and lively texture leaves a hoppy and citrus finish. A must for hop-heads."
"D: For 10% this is very drinkable and smooth, the malt gets a little sweeter toward the finish as it warms, but overall this is a delicious beer and love to see it in a can!"
"The mouthfeel is about as good as it gets though. It is smooth and silky, with low carbonation and a lingering oily finish. The drinkability was okay. It wasn't a chore to finish this beer...that was easy even for 10%. It just was a little strange tasting, and I'm not sure I'll have this again."
"Poured crystal clear and gold, looked a bit heavy during the pour. A thin off-white cap quickly formed and left sticky lace on the glass. Good head retention. Very fruity aroma, pineapple, lots of citrus with grapefruit dominating. Faintly catty with green, grassy hop notes and a bit of sweet malt. Bitterness was solid throughout, but stayed nicely balanced with big malt and fruity sweetness. Alcohol was forward, but not hot. More tropical fruit with lingering bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation, very smooth and viscous. Great drinkability for sizable IIPA, pleasant alcohol warmth and bitterness without destroying the palate completely."
"The taste is quite sweet and syrupy. The piney hops predominate, but thankfully there is more balanced hop flavors in the orange and citrus line of things. The juicy and estery hops are very pungent in this beer. There is a slighly booze soaked pineapple layer here, lots of sweet malts, and a barley wine type consistency. There is a cloying, and unpleasant biting sensation on the back of the tongue from this beer that I'm not happy about. It is as if some raw hop cones got out of line and wanted to produce a crude harshness and bite on the tongue. They succeeded. This needs to be tamed. There is a load of ABV in this beer and it does nothing to hide any of it. This is a strong, thick, syrupy DIPA with lots a very good qualities, but the biting and harsh bittering sensation really detracts."
"meh, not that impressed to be honest. this did improve as it warmed up but i started it at 46 degrees. after having several other oskar blues ales, this really does not come through. tons of bitterness but no complexity. besides the pine bitterness, nothing else really stands out. its not bad but not something ill seek out for how much this costs ($4 /can)."
"This is certainly a unique double IPA with the herbal presence dominating with only a bit of citrus and sweet malts to balance things out. Still, I really enjoyed this one, though I couldn't see myself drinking more than one at a time."
"Drinkability: This is about as different an IPA as I have ever had. I do want this again, but I am not sure if I would ever drink more than one in a night."
"Much thanks to psycohops for tossing a few cans of this my way. Canned with care on 3-15-10. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. GUBNA appears a clear golden copper color with about a finger of quickly vanishing off white foam. The head leaves no discernible lace behind. Nose and flavors consist of alcohol, ripe pineapples, other tropical fruits such as mango, citrus-y orange and tangerine, caramel, a of bit dank weed, some pine, candy coating like on a candy apple. The taste does not live up to the complex aromas, but it is no slouch either. Just not mind blowing. Body is bit lacking with decent carbonation. The alcohol burn hurts the drinkability for me just a tad, otherwise it would be a 4.5 especially considering the ABV. I saw the bottom of my glass quite quickly. Thanks again for the cans Bob!"
"Bits and pieces of this beer is great, but the flavor is lacking."
"D: One and you're done."
"a different take on the style. not like any beer i've had. not terrible, but I'm glad i bought only the one can. probably won't visit this one again. canned two weeks ago on 3-15-10, so freshness is not a problem. I can see why people like it, yet its just not for me."
"Drinkability is good. Alcohol is well-hidden."
"Drinkability: I would have this again, and would love to try this on tap. I recommend this to those seeking a floral Imperial IPA with a solid hop profile throughout your sip."
"Overall I really liked this beer although I can't say I was all that surprised, I don't think I've had a beer from OB that I've disliked. A few tweaks to the hop bill would help out the flavor profile just a bit but I'm really just nitpicking. Well worth a shot."
"very unique experience and enjoyed the beer. not sure I would say it is real drinkable due to the sweetness & boozy taste on the end. all in all, good beer."
"Hard pour into duvel tulip. Orangy light brown color with a bright white head. Fantastic thick, oily lacing that slowly subsides. This smells fantastic, similar to a pliny with citrusy grapefruit, hops and pine...Very aromatic. First impression on the taste; this is a heavy duty high test extreme brew! The first taste is some syrupy malt somewhat similar to a barelywine, with an intense very strong bitter finish and the expected alcohol warmth. This is surely intense! (coming from a lupulin threshold victim). But the citrus hop taste that I thought I detected in the nose is not to be found here! This is a thick oily, mildly cloying beast, with very low drinkability (for me). If you want an extreme beer, you've found it. The quality is there for sure. I'm sure I'll revisit."
"TOTAL: 41/50"
"The price alone is discouraging, but everytime I buy a four pack I drink it in one or two days."
"Pour is a bright gold with a nice head that leaves tons of lacing. Nice looking beer. Smell is, well, uh, interesting? Is that garlic? I get some hops behind it but the garlicy smell is odd. Man, not sure what to think about this one - the taste also has something odd though not as much as the smell. I at least get a nice punch of hops upfront, but the after taste brings back the garlicy thing. Mouth feel is normal. Drinkability was heading for a 2 - 2.5, but I am noticing improvements across the board as it warms - I am not sure that it isn't that I am used to the smell or that it really is mellowing. Think I'll have another in a day or 2 to see what the story is."
"12 ouncer, $3.99/can(!) at Whole Foods Bowery in NYC. I can find no dating info, although one previous reviewer did refer to it. Pours typical lighter amber, with a slight grenish olive oil hue, off white head is tight knit, moderate in volume, then leaving a thicker film, medium collar and ample scattered and fine lace. Loads of pine hop goodness in the nose. Big and bold DIPA, pine hop notes continue to exert their muscle and dominate the palate. Nice addition to the OB line..wonder what is availability will be on the East coast. Hop heads seek out and enjoy"
"I'm frankly not a fan here. By far the laggard of the Oskar Blues line."
"Can is dated 3-15-10, probably as fresh as I could get on the east coast. Pours a pretty bright orange, 1-finger foamy white head is kept alive by numerous carbonation bubbles. A bit of sediment floats in a standstill. Leaves good lacing. I could smell this easily while pouring it, a seriously STRONG citrus smell, it's like sticking your nose inside a tangerine. Also picking up somewhat dank, earthy notes. I'm taken a bit back on my first sip. A seriously sweet tangerine taste. Ripe orange peels if you rolled them around in hops, dirt, cannabis, and sugar cane. I still can't stop smelling this one, the nose is insanely fresh smelling. Any trace of booze is really hidden by the strong tastes. Almost like a beer-version of one of those strange Dole fruit combo drinks (orange-pineapple-pomegranate juice). Definitely unlike any other IPA I have had. The flavors here are pretty excellent but I think they're a bit over the top, the sweetness is way too high. If it was toned down or balanced better this may enter Sculpin-esque territory, because the fruity tastes here really are great. Mouthfeel is good, very oily and a little creamy. Carbonation is at a good level, booze is very hidden until the end when it shows slightly. Drinkability I gotta pin at a 3.5, the sweetness gets to you, and the price ($16/4-pack) is pretty much inexcusable. I'd say pick up a single and try it out, definitely worth trying at least once. A great and original one here from Oskar Blues."
"Blast of malt cloaked hops on the nose. Bit reminiscent of an Alpine brew on the nose with citrus and wet pine, and some yeast notes a bit later. Taste follows with citrus and a nice spicy character. Offers a slightly coarse texture and finishes with a return of a lightly creamy orange malt presence. Carbonation becomes light by the bottom of the glass, but the beer doesn't become cloying, yet hides its strength well. Still a bit sweet but not unexpected from the brewery, or for the style, and particularly at 10%...."
"d - I thought this was an ok DIPA. The smell originally reminded me of HopSlam a little bit, but the taste wasn't quite there. I think the high alcohol here hurt it a little bit and was noticable. Not a bad DIPA, but a little bit disappointing."
"Drinkability - I could drink this all day long, alchohol is extremely well hidden, only problem is the rediculously high cost for this ipa."
"well the beer starts out with a nice yellow hue and nice white head then. the smell is very pungent but not in a bad way i kind of like it and it very resiny with some odd kind of off citrus notes. the taste os kind of off i feel like its missing something and has to much a one thing i attribute thats the sole use of summit hops. i feel like if they deverified the hops a bit this beer could have been great. the drink and mouth feel are fine"
"This is one weird DIPA. These Summit hops are strange, and while I enjoyed this I think I'd like something a bit more citrusy and, frankly, mainstream for my everyday DIPAs. A very interesting beer; definitely worth picking up and giving a try."
"F: Even more bitter as it seems to build, but that strange gumball/gummy bear fruit flavor also come through on the beginning of the finish, but seems to give way to the heavy fresh musty wet hops. The heavy bitterness just sticks around, bombarding the tongue. Crazy, and doesn't seem to want to fade. It's a little drier due to the crazy hop bitterness, but still sticky sweet from the heavy malts. I think I could call this beer a triple version of Gumballhead. It's nice to know I can get some of the weird 3F flavors distributed here, but the heavy sweetness and ridiculous amount of hops almost overpowers it and takes away from the crazy 3F flavors."
"Totally overpriced at $5.45 per can though, one and done on this one."
"Would I buy more of it? - yeah, I definitely would seek this out again. I've got 3 more cans which should last a little while but when they're gone I will go in search of some replacements."
"D: Just not there. Struggling to finish one. Needs something to balance out the vegetal flavor."
"Grabbed a four pack of this at Bermans in Lexington. Pours out orange, with about two fingers of white heading. Smell is pof dank, pine hops, but there is also something off putting in there as well, cannot quite put my finger on it. Taste is dominated by the hops, and has a sour quality to it as well. Metallic as well at times. Not a whole hell of a lot of balance either, as the hops totally dominate. Overall I am pretty bummed, as OB tends to make awesome stuff. Not recommended."
"This is a unique DIPA. Kudos for doing an all Summit IPA. They rye is a nice addition, I'm guessing it's about 10% rye in the grain bill. It gives the beer a spicy flavor and smooth mouthfeel. I love summit hops, but for me the sweetness distracts from the hops. Lowering the abv to 8-9% might help to dry this beer out, and smooth the alcohol burn. Nice effort, but it needs to be refined a bit."
"EDIT: Had another can from this batch. The aroma has died considerably, as have the hops. Now there is an astringent bitterness, some onion flavors in the aftertaste that take away from the experience. Drinkability now is much lower."
"drinkability - this is a great ipa, the hop flavor is amazing, it's not a session beer"
"which gives this beer a slight upgrade for new nobility. Look, I like sitting drunkenly in a Caterpillar as much as anybody, but I still take the Gubna's orders.. more to come .."
"One week later since my reveiw and I have to say I like this stuff more and more as I work through the case. It's by far the spiciest IPA I've ever had and I'm really impressed Oskar only used one type of hop. I need to grab another case of this before it's gone for another year."
"Would absolutely recommend every hophead try this one. Price is a little steep but you probably only need 1 4 pack anyway. Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"This beer is pretty refreshing and an easy drinker, but there's a lot of odd hop flavors going on here that require attention to be appreciated. I think I'd like another variety or two of hops in here to complement each other and make this a more delicious beer. As it stands, this is an unbelievably interesting IPA, but that's not enough to get me to shell out 4 bucks a can consistently."
"D= I'm struggling with this one can, and not enjoying the excessive ABV% that is only diminishing any enjoyment. If you do like this stuff, be sure to find their Dale's Pale Ale if you haven't had it (also in a nuveau-trend can). It's got better flavor and less un-necessary ABV."
"D - This is a great, great beer. Just a notch below the pliny's for me...but since they aren't available here, I think I will be buying this again and again (although $18/4pk is pretty steep). Still think it will be a staple in my fridge. My """new""" favorite beer in a can, hands down."
"The beer has an oily mouthfeel and the medium carbonation level works well for the style. Bottom line is this beer is a laser guided Summit hops bomb straight to the mouth with no time for balance and hell bent on making your tongue beg for mercy. While the taste arguably isn't bad, my friend surprisingly drain poured his and said, """This beer tastes like body odor smells.""" With that being said, if unbalanced hops is what you crave, then look no further."
" A foamy whit head, sticky lacing yellow and gold ale with a very slight haze. This DIPA pour rather clear for the style....very pretty. I could dump this into a glass for one of my BMC drinking pals... they would not be the wiser except for the smell. There is no getting past the aromas of catty hops, fresh pine and lemon zest with grapefruit. Smelling GUBNA makes my pallet crave the hops. My mouth begins to water with the expectation of bitter, bitter hops. Oskar Blues delivers on the hops in bitterness and flavor. The first sip is twice the kick that the nose had moments ago. Alcohol and hops is all i can taste. I can detect no caramel or grain taste. This is a one dimensional brew...hops delivery vehicle, and I am in love. Grapefruit and lemon peels, and I swear I am finding very slight green onion. For the thin body and good amount of carbonation the aftertaste is minimal but bitter all the way. I have to say even at 10%ABV I find this very drinkable and could put more than 2 of these back. Tread lightly my fellow BA's when facing the GUBNA!"
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1 1/4""" off white head above the clear golden amber brew. Dense head lasts nicely, with lots of sticky lace. Aroma is dominated by funktacular pine hoppiness. Taste is quite sweet upfront, quickly giving way to the piney bitterness, which coasts through the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, even with the strong bitterness, and drinkability is great for the style. Yay, good beer, and yay good beer in cans!"
"Be careful with this one, people!"
"Let this beer start to warm a bit before drinking, it is superb then. (I know this is true of most beers, but is really true with GUBNA.)"
"This started out as a very good beer. Unfortunately a week later after I finished the fourth one I was sure I would never buy it again. Don;t get me wrong this beer was exactly as advertised, huge, super-hoppy double IPA. Too bad it was all Summit hops. All I could smell was pine, cattiness, pine oil and the taste was identical with the added qualities of parmesan and pepper.. I prefer a hop profile that has a citrus element of some sort to balance out the pine. If you like Maharaja or Green Flash Imperial IPA you will probably like this."
"I came into this with high hopes, as I love everything that Oskar Blues puts out, and was especially hyped knowing how good Gordon is. This was one of the worst disappointments in my beer drinking experience. I can hardly finish this single can, let alone the 4 pack I bought. This beer is way too unbalanced, and the flavors are not pleasant at all. The other cans may sit in my fridge for some time, as I am not impressed with anything about this beer."
"D - while glad I tried it, for the price there are others that I like better such as the Heavy Seas Big DIPA and the Maharaja. I wouldn't order it again. I was a little disappointed after hearing such good things about it"
"Decent DIPA overall, but, in my opinion, not close to the ranks of Pliny, Dreadnaught, Hopslam, etc. Actually, this reminds me of Exponential Hoppiness a bit."
"I found this to be very easy to drink and thoughts raced to ideas about casks and kegs for this particular ale."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable for such a high ABV drink. I can barely taste the alcohol and there is only a slight warming on the way down. A pretty good DIPA, but after testing it head to head with PtE, there is no way I would ever get this if I have PtE readily available. This is over four dollars a can for 12 ounces, whereas PtE is less than five dollars for 16 ounces. Pliny not only tastes better IMO, but is cheaper than this. A good beer, but I will never drop 16+ dollars again for a four pack."
"Beautiful hue, floral aroma's with bitter hop and soft herbal notes. Flavors explode with edgy bitter hop, soft undertones of vegetable, and herbal blossom, followed by lingering subtleties of fruit that gradually grow through out the finish. Hints of biscuit dance around in the underbelly, with the sharpness of the hop prevailing from start to finish."
"pours a a light peach color with an off white head and some good sticky lacing.. the smell was strange it was tropical fruit (good) with medicinal/fish smell (bad) but more on the fruit side..the taste was better then the smell the tropical fruits..mango and pineapple with grapefruit hit you first.then some crisp/strong hops and pine right after led to a syrupy malt finish i did detect some alcohol heat but it is 10% abv..this was not as well balanced as it could be and the mouth feel was a little on the syrup side and thick..overall i put this on the top of a 2nd tier dipa,,because of the taste and the cost of about $4 a can..ill crack a couple of more this week and update but as of now its just a good dipa not a great one"
"It has an immense fruit flavor: ripe peach, pineapple, grapefruit and a slight piney bitterness and some grain on the back end. The pineapple personally is a bit off putting but it works here with the other tropical fruit flavors. But alas coating all of this fruit is a horde of tomato and onion veggie surprise which makes it undrinkable past the first few sips. It isn't too bitter, a balanced DIPA, but a vegetastic one."
"I love a canned beer, and this one is very nice. Poured from the can into a snifter, beautiful copper/orange color with an off-white head that laced well and stuck around a good bit before dissipating to a cap and crown. Quite complex aroma with a bitter pine note prevailing slightly over the rye. Taste is nicely balanced with the rye being maybe just a slight bit more prevalent than the hops. Feel is very smooth with a medium body and slightly less than average carbonation. Great drinking beer even for the ABV."
"Overall, I'm probably not gonna pick this up again for the price, but it was a surprising and enjoyable brew."
"The Gubna is worth trying, but this could never run for President with Pliny. Go for the single before dropping $17 on a four pack of this. Not much reason for me to buy this again when I can get better IPAs much cheaper. I'll take the rounder flavor of Gordon over the Gubna too."
"D: A good but not amazing DIPA, especially for the price. I really enjoy some of the Oskar Blues beers, but why buy a 12 oz can of Gubna for $4-5 when I can buy half a liter of Pliny the Elder for that much?"
"A: Light to medium gold - reminds me of a dark honey, thin layer of head, no noticeable lacing, slight viscosity visible in the swirl - 4.00, S: Tons of citrus especially grapefruit and orange, a touch of spice and mild pepper; thick, syrupy and resiny; the aroma reminds me of golden raisins and passion fruit - 4.50, T: Sharp hop bite, heaps of grapefruit, alcohol is evident but does not notably interfere with the palate, pureed raisins and dates, tons of malt, extremely pungent - 4.50, M: Very smooth and silky - 4.50, D: An outstanding imperial IPA, incredibly drinkable for a 10% beer - 4.25"
"Nice amber/silver poured can into Chimay goblet glass. Very bright clear golden color with a big pillowy head that stuck around for a couple minutes. Fair amount of sticky lacing left on the glass. I find the hop smell to be very appealing. I never really knew what summit hops specifically smelled like but I certainly do now. Very floral nose and the summits are intense. Taste is nice, big hop smack in the mouth followed by bitterness. The hop flavor really comes through in this beer and the hop taste really sticks around. Light mouthfeel with an oily hop coating on your tongue. Drinakbility is good. Hard to believe it's 10% abv. I sense no hint of alcohol at all, but I certainly feel it after 2 :-) Nice beer from Oskar Blues and I will buy when I see it locally."
"Sweet, medium body, lots of bitterness on the backend. The hop flavor is good on the palate too. It finishes nicely. Second taste, not a lot of midpalate character and the carbonation in the mouth is low. Overall its a nice DIPA. Not too malty, not chewy, good bitterness and nice balance. Sweet."
"Notes: Pity, it really got me excited early on and in the end did not quite make it. And I mean it did not quite make it as one of the top-notch DIPAs out there, and for most of the brew I felt it was getting there. It's a new release and sure deserves a try as brewing of new batches goes along to see if there is any difference. I also agree that it reminds me quite a bit of Avery's Maharaja but in the end the completely rounded act is not there. Great addition in any case from Oskar Blues."
"Drinkability: pretty good"
"This beer kicks ass!!! Great job from a great brewery!!! If you like DIPA this beer will knock your socks off. The smell is like pine tar and grapefruit, yummmy.... and the taste is great. Pure hoppines with the right malt back bone.... this beer could get you in trouble!!!!"
"D- This is a great DIPA. It's pretty drinkable even with it's rich hop bitterness and 10% ABV."
"D: This is fantastic, it blows away Gordon without even trying, sorry Gordon. Nice sipping DIPA."
"This beer pours a nice golden amber color with a foamy white head. The nose is amazing loaded with grapefruit and citrus with notes of fresh cut grass and pine. It was hard to let the aromas go long enough to take a sip. The palate is full and round with some distinctive hoppy notes, not your typical hops either. The hops all most have a hint of caramel which is quite welcoming. Overall one of the best colorado made Imperial IPAs"
"Great Imperial IPA! The appearance and bouqet are brilliant. This will not be my last Gubna."
"Finish of big citrus oils and pine. This big hoppy beer can hold it's head up high with any of the complex and popular hop head brews."
"D - All I can say is wow. For 10% abv, this is a dangerously drinkable brew. The flavor and balance are both excellent, and the lighter body for such a big beer lets this one go down so smooth. Gubna is definitely making its way into my regular rotation."
"It's a good looking beer with good texture, and probably a valiant effort for people who don't get onions from the hops. However for me it's a total dog."
"D: really liked this beer. thought it was true to the style of a double/imperial IPA. if you like Dale's and like IPA's you won't be dissapointed."
"I try to avoid hyperbole. This business has WAY too much already. So I will simply say this: Just when you think the last thing the world needs is another Double IPA, Gubna comes around and sweeps you off your feet. Well done Dave, well done."
"The body is moderate. Very easy drinking and no real off notes. I would have expected a bit more astringency but very clean. Overall a good DIPA that is more along the fruity side. Im sensitive to simcoe and there seems to be a bunch here."
"Tastes potently hop flavored with strong hop bitter and an accompanying flat alcohol sting. Carbonation is strong and contributes to the assault, too. Hop flavors are so potent they almost come across as syrupy and sour. Lotsa green onion and baby aspirin. Plum skin, blood oranges, lemony pith, sand (like from a sandbox, not a beach). Weedy. Hop bitter is multi-dimensional consisting of a clean bitter and a raspy cohumulone bitter. Malt flavor, if any, is lost beneath the hops. Could be some esters of plum, but it's hard to tell if they are esters or from the hops. Very abrasive ending from the hop bitter, alcohol sting, and lingering super-hopp flavor. All in a dry mouth. Thick mouthfeel, which is strange that it can be so dry in the aftertaste."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite OB beers...been tending toward more malty beers but this may sway me back to the land of hops."
"It's very drinkable and it's definitely one of, in not my #1, favorite from the Oskar Blues line. I think I'll have another!"
"Overall a fantastic version of the style. The tap handle showed what must be the eventual packaging for the Gubna - A rusty maroon colored 12oz. can. Note to self: look for said can in stores soon."
"Medium to full body has great carbonation and a lasting finish. Great beer from Oskar Blues. Right up there with their best."
"D: Was considering ordering a pint of this after my sampler. If anything, that should say something as it was begging me for more."
