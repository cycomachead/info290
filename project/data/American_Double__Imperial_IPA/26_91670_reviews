"Nice balance.  Malty sweetness and citra hops."
""
""
""
""
"Why this beer gets 100 on BeerAdvocate is beyond me. this beer tastes stale and oxidized, cloying with the malt, and I drank a fresh bottle! (only 3 weeks old). 3Floyds is just not good with IPAs. Stouts yes, but their IPAs suck. they need to learn how to brew a new age IPA like New England."
""
""
""
""
"I'm resigned to the fact that certain flavor profiles must not be compatible with my palate. This was a bottle less than 30 days old, and was reminiscent of stale, cold french onion soup. Looked nice, didn't smell terrible, but the taste of garlic and onion was overwhelming. Bad bottle? I don't know. Maybe I'll find out someday. As much I adore Gumballhead and Zombie Dust, this was an epic 3F's failure for me. I'll chalk it up as an """it wasn't meant to be""" experience and move on."

"Intense ipa! really nice fruit flavor with a bunch of hops"
""
"Earthy spicy fruity garlicky hops. Really rich and sweet. I'm not sure I love this. It's a bit...much? It tries to do too much. The aftertaste though is overwhelming. It doesn't end. I can't get it to go away. It clings through water, through pickles. It's a candied papaya sort of flavor with drying bitterness. Candy like and increasingly pleasant the more I drink. What a DIPA. Color me impressed, but one is enough forever."

"Enjoyed at Hunahpu's Day 2015 at Cigar City Brewery."
"Seriously the nose on this.."
""
""
"The single best double/imperial IPA I have ever had."
"One of my all time favorites!"
""
""
"I think the label design is actually better than the beer. This is a perfect example of a beer that is overrated because it comes from a trusted brewery. Love 3 Floyds, but there's no way that this brew deserves a Top spot."

"At Huna '15 this was an incredibly delicious IPA. I had this right after drinking heady. Less orange/peach but more body, better aroma, and all around better IPA for my money."
""
"T) Damn its good.  All those tropical flavors hit home.  Mango, melon, a little grapefruit.  bitterness is low despite the quoted 100IBU.  Alcohol is non-existent.  You could sip it or crush it almost."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could drink this every day. Absolutely one of the best beers I have ever had. The heavy fruity, citrusy taste, mixed with a light bitterness is what I look for in a IPA/DIPA. You can't go wrong with this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not the best DIPA, but certainly a top 10 for me."

"On tap at FFF brewpub poured into half pint. Appearance is that typical Floyd’s slightly hazy orange-copper color with an internal radiance that may have been fueled by my excitement that they re-tapped this beer after running out of one of their guest handles. A thin off-white cap remains in place for the duration and leaves rings. Aroma is tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, resin, pine, and caramel. Taste is medium citrus hop bitterness trailed by light malt sweetness. Medium bodied, oily and syrup thick texture, average to soft carbonation, finishes dry and bitter."
"I've had this 100 times, whether via draft at Three Floyd's Pub or bomber, and I love it.  BUT.... this is the only beer that made me and my dad look each other in the eye and say """wow, this is the best beer ever", upon having our first sip together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is outstanding in this beer, lots of juicy peach with some nice citrus, and some really dank pine to it. Flavor doesnt follow through though, very sweet and unbalanced."
""
""
""
"The beer itself... so juicy. So hoppy. So well balanced for a beer this big. Still blown away."
"BRUTAL label, love everything about this beer. I'm a floyds fanboy and this is why. Zombie on steroids? Drink it fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty good it's surprisingly sweet but it's not world class I'd drink it again on tap but at their 22 oz prices meh"
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding brew! Absolutely one of my favorite Double IPA's. Excellent!"
"Great tasting, perhaps the best beer I've ever had"

"Just a great beer, if you can get yer hands on a bottle DO IT!"
""
""
"O- How is this 10.5%? I can't wrap my head around how deliciously smooth this is while also being so high gravity.  Astonishing.  Just when I thought I've encountered all the wonderful and complex layers of flavor a DIPA has to offer, something like this comes along to show me that there are still a lot of innovations left to be seen in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
"The strong alcohol content gets lost in the awesome hops that blend piney/earthy flavor and citrus. FFF gets it right with a lot of hop forward beers and Permanent Funeral is my favorite of them all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very bitter and piney Ipa def not my favorite but still a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Tasted from draft at Firkin on January 23, 2015."
"O- Another awesome beer from 3 Floyds.  Definitely worth seeking out, alcohol is not fully hidden, but it actually works in balancing the beer.  Wish I had more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wayyy too boozy for me."
"Overall a good beer, but I will probably stick to other IPAs in the future. Glad I got to try it. 3.75"
"If it's on tap, then it should be your first. If it's available to go, then """Get some!""""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was expecting a lot, and boy it delivered.  Will be getting this again if I ever see it for sure."
"Quite frankly, this is one of the best ipas I've tried and one of three floyds best showings. Boom."
""
""
"Recommendation: Must-try, hop-head or not."
"Loads of mango, mandarin bit of tangerines. Very juicy fruit. Not aggressive at all and super smooth to drink."
"FFF third best IPA offering after Zombie Dust and Space Cake Middle Finger"

"On tap at the 3 Floyds brewpub"

"Overall, this is definitely up there in the conversation for top 10 DIPAs out there. Not in my personal top 5, but certainly in my top 10. A real treat and so glad I got to try this badboy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was pretty good, but I found it overly sweet, and with some downright weird flavors (that I've gotten in other hoppy FFF beers) that I just don't really love. Decent, but I'd never pick this up with the wealth of other options available."
""
""
""
""
"Essentially this is like an Imperial version of zombie dust. Seeing that ZD is my fave brew ever, I am crazy about this one. An amazing nose on this one and the taste follows right behind. Truly world class."

""
""

"I am not quite as knowledgeable as some but I know what I like. So do my bartenders Joel and Nick at Bigbys Pour House in Addison Illinois. Most times I walk in and a beer just appears. The past two days it has been Permanent Funeral. the beer is served in a small glass due to the 10.5% ABV. This fine brew does not taste like or go down like some of the higher ABV brews. It has a very nice carmel color and the head lingers a while. While it is a Double/Imperial IPA and I would have not chosen this initially believing that it would be strong and all hopped up it was DELICIOUS!! One of my favorites the past two months. Give it try."

"Pours a golden amber. Clear. Beige Lacey for me to finger head. Aroma! A mess of hops. Citrus fruits! Complex taste. Lemon. Oranges. Tropical over ripe fruits. High alcohol. Delicious beer."
""
"I wish I had 365 more of these"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very big beer that's incredibly well made. Perhaps a tad thin, but this is easily the best DIPA I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smoking good"
""
"The taste is absolutely amazing. This tastes like fresh, wet hops. The pure hop flavor shines through in this as much as any DIPA I have ever had (reminds me of Pliny in that way). Tropical fruits are on the tongue just like the nose: grapefruit, mango, sweet hone, etc. There is some pine and dankness as well. The perfect balance for me. As much as I love Dreadnaught, Alpha King, Zombie Dust, Arctic Panzer Wolf, etc., this is the best FFF offering imo.  An absolutely stunning beer that you should definitely get your hands on."

"Damn this is near perfect.  A fairly light malt backbone rides a huge citrus smell AND taste. A wonderful crafted ale. Very strong across all metrics."
""
""
""
"O-  One of the better DIPAs out there.  I enjoy and appreciate a lot of what FFF delivers and this was no letdown.  I thoroughly enjoy Zombie Dust and this would be comparable to Zombie Dust on steroids.  Very bold and packs a punch, which is what is expected.  My only complaint is the same I always have with FFF, I wish it was more easily obtainable.  Great beer."

"yup, its real, a double pale ale as they call it, and maybe the best beer i have had from the acclaimed three floyds. this stuff is magic, rich in grain base without ever being sweet. almost has the base of an esb, a huge one, but its in that range. the point here though is the hops, and its really hoppy. in the smell i am thinking simcoe, its so bitter smelling, green and leafy and crystalline, like the sticky dankest bud, where the fingers get all stuck like super glue. the nose is the hop equivalent of trimming blue dream plants, no joke. the flavor is less of that, more refined aggression if you will. the hops are woody here, more centennial like fundamentally, but so overdosed as to not be recognizable as their normal selves. the malt does in fact provide a cool balance to all the hops, which was unsuspected. it almost seems light for a second in the middle there, where the hops are more fruity than anything and the grain is at its fullest, but the bitterness returns to thrash the palate in the finish, its really intensely flavored stuff, but well put together. i have gone back and forth on whether or not the hype around this brewery is fairly founded, and this may have tipped me into thinking it is. really unique and enormous beer."

"It smelled great. Malt presence was strong, but not overpowering like a lot of big IPA's. I really get disappointed when an ipa tastes like a malt bomb. I would drink this again...and again...and again. This beer is in my top 20 ever had."

"Bottle in trade from Joe. Thanks buddy! Been wanting to try this one for a while now. Bottle dated 8/20/14 poured 9/11/14. Pours very slightly hazy golden orange colored with a huge creamy and fluffy white head. Aroma is big time juicy citrus hops, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, grass, sweet malt and very reminiscent of Dreadnaught (though it's been a while since I had that one). Flavor is big on the dry pine bitterness with sweet mango and grapefruits, some sweet malt backing but this is much lighter than expected. Lingering dry bitterness on the tongue. This seems to bridge the gap of the super bitter and the sweet tropical malty DIPA extremes and comes off very nicely. Medium plus bodied, very resinous, dry finish, with medium carbonation. This is excellent."

"O - Permanent Funeral is a grand offering from Three Floyds. It's definitely one worthy of grabbing a place in their year round or seasonal bottlings. Just when you think these guys can't add anymore brilliance in terms of a big ipa they slap everyone In the mouth and create an all out jewel of a brew like this. It's def my 2nd favorite brew from them behind only the infamous dreadnaught, but both offer different qualities and that's great to see. No doubt Permanent Funeral will go down as an all time great for years to come."

"O - Its been a while since I've had a bottle of Dreadnaught, but this seems reminiscent of that fine beer in my recollections. Malt profile is pure Three Floyds - their bigger IPA/DIPA offerings seem pretty similar in this regard. I think the yeast used in common among many of these beers too. I find Three Floyds and Stone have very distinctive and identifiable fermentation profiles that I feel confident I can pickup blind pretty easily. Very glad I got to give this one a try."

""
"O: among the very best I've had."
""
"Had this one on tap at the 3Floyds taproom. Poured a light orange, hazy, with a decent sized white head. Hop-forward aroma, which gave way to a very well blended DIPA. The malt comes through with a sweeter, caramel flavor to balance the slight bitterness from the hops. Overall, well balanced and delicious. Glad I could try it fresh from the source!"

"What an incredible beer. I've been disappointed (slightly) with some of the coveted, non-West Coast-style IPA's, but I'd put this up against just about any of my favorite IPA's. Refreshing, layered, balanced, drinkable (dangerously)...no hype in this one, this is the real deal."
""
""
""
"This is by the perfect beer for me. The smell and the taste is just amazing. I love the thick body for the beer. You can't even tell the high 10.5 abv. This beer is not always available at the brewpub and I really wish it was. Well actually not cause I would go broke cause I would always keep my fride full."

"Dank, dank dank hops in every aspect of this great beer. Cloudy hoppy golden appearance. Hop smells waft out of the glass with pine, citrus and some bready aspects from the malts. Flavor profile follow suit with a huge punch of wonderfully balanced hops and malts. Just a great beer from FFF. Thrilled to have picked up a case."

"Been anticipating this one for a long time. Appearance is exactly what I want in a dipa, beautiful hazy copper orange. Less nose than I expected, could pick up some grapefruit and pine but not overwhelming. At first was slightly disappointed. Seemed a bit unrefined and bitter. After sitting for five minutes and warming up the citrus starts to come out and evens out. Half way through bottle it was what I had hoped for. Overall a wonderful dipa and worthy of its rating. Definitely not an everyday beer or for faint of heart but one I hope to secure again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All said and done, a very good DIPA, but could benefit from a little more floral citrus and balance on the palate. Well done nonetheless."
""
""
"T: Mango and peach upfront, with a resinous pine note creeping in around the middle. Finish brings a blanket of caramel malt and some lingering pine on the finish. From reading other reviews, it seems like this has faded a bit in the month and a half since it was bottled. Really glad to have tried it, but I'll have to try it again a bit fresher."

"Despite the bottle being 5 months old, this held up being incredible well. Possibly the best hoppy beer from Three Floyds."
""
""
""
"Overall, can't say I like this better than Zombie Dust because I tasted it almost a month after bottled. Still, it's one of the best """pale ales""" I've ever tried. Hope they brew this one again. As a SoCal native, I don't have buyer's remorse for what I spent on this beer. Says a lot for a mere """pale ale.""""
""
""

"O-What a beer this one turned out to be. I loved its pure power and it's intriguingly unique hoppiness. Will probably never try this again and that makes this review very bittersweet."
""
""
""
""
"Permanent Funeral is an amazingly hoppy double IPA that contains boatloads of those sweet, tropical fruit notes that I love so much. Three Floyds makes a number of excellent hoppy beers and this is one of their best."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great DIPA. On par with some of the best. Very well hidden ABV."
"By the way, in terms of pairing this with food - I drank the first half of the bomber while cooking and enjoying spaghetti and red sauce for dinner, and the second half with ice cream afterward. Honestly, I got the best flavor when I was just drinking the beer; pairing it feels like a conundrum. It doesn't have the same dry acidy bite that calls out for cheese that I sometimes get from other big pale ales, and it's not as sweet as I expected from some of the other reviews. (I am guessing that the people who find it extraordinarily sugary are not drinking it fresh.) I hope I find it again so I can get closer to matching it with the perfect partner. In short: get some of this if you can, and don't hold on to it - drink it!"

"Overall: This beer was crazy good. Easily making it into my top 3. Can't wait to gave more!"

""
"A beautiful looking beer: a slightly burnt bright orange. A nice but not overpowering piney-citrus scent and a big oily mouthfeel. Upfront the taste is intense: pungently hoppy with a grapefruit orange flavor. But I found the finish just a bit bland. Nice no doubt but not as powerful as I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O - This may be the best DIPA I've ever had. I prefer it to Heady, and it's neck and neck with Pliny. I hope to find this one again sometime down the road..."
""
""
"O - One of, if not my all-time favorite beers. I get this every chance I get. I cannot emphasize the importance of freshness with this one though. I've had it several times in a bomber a couple weeks after being bottled, and it was amazing; however, I had it on draft at a place that tapped it 6 months ago, and it was a completely different beer. The tangerine and citrus hop aroma and flavor were gone, and all that was left was malt and intense bitterness."
"What a perfect DIPA! Had it on-tap in a tall pint glass in Perrysburg, Ohio at Swig. Thank you Three Floyd's and thank you Swig. At $9 a pint, I decided to switch to the much less expensive Ballast Point Sculpin after that. Might as well have had a Bud. Just couldn't taste the Sculpin after that amazing hop blast from 3F."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A damn good DIPA! Great hop profile, and a very pleasant hop aftertaste left behind. For 10.5% abv, this has almost no trace of alcohol heat at all. I do however prefer my DIPAs to be a little heavier on the tongue, but that's the only negative I can come up with. Overall, this beer is a must for any lover of hops."

"Pour is a hazed dark amber with a tight off white head. Nose is piney hops, resin, notes of orange peel, and an underlying grain. Taste is not overly hoppy, a bit of balance with the hops bringing pine and a hint of hop resin. The citrus comes in in back, strong orange and a touch of orange juice. Finish is very dry, gently carbonated with a soft body."

"As I sat reviewing this beer, each number I entered I thought to myself """this can't be that good", and with each successive drink it was actually that good. An IIPA dripping with juicy fruits, an aroma that makes you salivate uncontrollably, assertive bitterness, and drinkability that will get you in trouble. This is the best IIPAs I've had in ages and probably prefer to Dreadnaught. Oh, and Pig Destroyer is fucking HEAVY!"

"Taste-Onrush of sweet, toasted malt, pineapple and candy sugar. Big hop profile not quite enough to keep things in balance, as this brew comes off a bit too sweet for my tastes. Cries out for a spicy food pairing to balance things out a bit."

"O- this beer us delicious but the sugaryness to it keeps it from being outstanding to me. This bottle was dated almost 2 months ago so that could have something to do with it. Will revisit this beer again more fresh."
"Overall I really like this PALE ALE from Three Floyds. Rivals Zombie Dust in hop flavor and drinkablilty. Well done!"
""
"O - I'll be honest, Permanent Funeral isn't for me. Don't get me wrong, I love double IPAs, but this beer just goes a bit over-the-top. It's extreme hop profile and almost cloyingly sweet malt base clash on my tongue, finishing with neither component the victor, just a mash-up of one extreme vs. the other without compromise or collaboration."
"O- I need more! I caught myself drinking this way too fast because it was so delicious, so smooth and balanced.. good lord this is a good beer!"
""
""
"O-Fantastic example of what FFF is doing with pale ales."
""

"Pours to a hazy amber gold in tone.  Head only achieves about an inch of off white head.  So often top pours try not to give you much head.  A little more here would have been nice, otherwise perfect.  Nose is flourishing citrus and floral hops explosion.  Super fragrant and it really gets the mouth watering.  Taste is just so big and luscious with the gambit of citrus going on here.  You get citrus rind, juicy freshness, and even the orange based meaty pulp plays in the flavor.  The flavor profile of this beer is just so vibrant and full.  Really on of the most flavorful and drinkable DIPA's I have ever enjoyed, and I've had a few.  Complex and not abrasive at all."
"Luminous orange color. Fragrant pine and mango on the nose. This is sticky, gooey, luscious hop business from start to finish. It's humid and tropical up in here -- just like you want a DIPA. The hops bite nice, but the malt rounds things off perfectly. This is extremely well balanced. A delightful beer, but falls just short of the hype for me. It may be the freshness factor: My bottle was 1.5 months old. I would definitely reevaluate with a slightly fresher offering."
""
"O - one of the best DIPAs I've had. Too bad it was a one-off. I love its uniqueness,  especially with the apricot notes."
"O - No one would mistake this as anything other than a serious beer. Surprising, given its over 10% ABV, is the lack of heavy booziness. This could get you in trouble for sure.  One of the finest DIPAs I've had."

"The feel is dry without giving off an aspirin or chalk-like scrape on the tongue, staying consistently dry but keeping the tongue from fatigue with the juiciness. The body is big but not too heavy, enough to support everything happening without weighing down. The bite is strong from beginning to end, and smoothness is not neglected."

"This is definitely a big beer, but what I really like about it is the strong malt backbone that can hold up to the gush of citrusy hops. This beer pours a hazy orange with a serious head that sticks to the glass leaving behind a gluelike crust as you drink. Big citrus aromas with a citrusy taste held in check by a caramel malt keeping this big beer from wrecking your palate. This brew only got better on the second pour from the bomber. Plenty of hoppy flavor without too much bitterness. FFF hit the nail on the head with this one."

"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O: Really love this beer, but after having it in the bottle I love is so much more on draft. Still really good though."

"Pours a very nice orange color. Minimal head that fizzled out quick. Leaves a nice bubbly ring around the glass. This smells awesome. Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, some other tropical fruits. It's so juicy. Tastes follows the nose really well. A lot of ipas smell awesome then fall short on the taste, this is not one of those ipas. Truly delicious. Grapefruit is abundant but there are so many other tropical flavors, too. Papaya, mango, hint of pineapple sweetness. So much flavor it's almost overwhelming. Slight alcohol burn and bitterness. The bitterness lingers on the top of my mouth. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, not overly carbonated but enough to feel it on the tongue. So easy to drink. I really liked his. Even with almost a month on it and it being shipped in artic temperatures it was amazing. If you like juicy ipas, definitely find one of these."

""

"Scary drinkable."
"O- Definitely a must try. Very different, but good. Three Floyd's totally pulled it off. Great IPA."
"Not much of a head on a very clear golden copper body but has excellent lacing. Aroma of wet socks, onion, vinegar, caramel and sour citrus. Flavor of tart citrus, vinegar, candy sugar, pale malts, wood and earthy hops. Medium but oily body and moderate carbonation. I have to say I am disappointed. I don't know everything about beers but how is this so highly reviewed? Is it bad, no. Is it amazing? No. Glad I had it, but I will only remember this as being disappointing."

"Poured a rich, deep amber with white head of very fine bubbles, persistent creamy and frothy. Aroma of citrus and piney hops evident even from a distance. Robust spicy tones from hops and malts. Beautifully sweet on the palate, balanced by just enough bitterness...again, piney, slight citrus, over-ripe papaya. Complex malt profile, some aromatic malt, and I swear a hint of rye. Finishes strong, tingling with a pleasant lingering residue that is not entirely bitter, nor sweet, nor alcoholic. Better when 50-55F than cold, IMO."

"Three Floyds Permanent Funeral ---4.5/5"
""
""
"Overall: 3 Floyds shows a little bit more finesse with this beer than I expected. I am not a huge fan of chalky and dank hops in hoppy beers (I prefer citrusy and tropical fruit notes from my hoppy beer), but this was still pretty good considering. I thought this beer was going to be another over hyped hoppy beer by 3 Floyds. It does remind me alot of Fremont Brewing's DIPA """The Brother"""."

"Appears a glowing orange copper hue with a big khaki tan beige head forming thick with a rocky textured head, fine speckled lacing layers on the sides of my chalice. Aroma is straight up citrus peels, pineapple flesh, and other tropical fruit notes flowing from the glass. So worth the drive to Newark, OH to try the last of their stock of this fine American brewed IPA. I don't know the next time I will see this beer but I will definitely savor this pour of 22 ounces of liquid bread coated hop candy. The flavor is sugar coated raw herbaceous hops, big citric layers, orange marmalade, tropical fruits...mango, star fruit, and hints of passion fruit. Over ripened fruit juice with bready malts bring all the caramelized sugars to the forefront and the big oily hop oils let those sweet candy qualities fade to the background. Mouthfeel is big oily resinous IPA, carbonated well carries each sip effortless down the gullet, to equate to perfect realm of dangerous drinkability. I can't talk enough about how much I enjoy this beer, all of the true hopheads listening go find this, drive 6-8 hrs if you have to, hell make a pilgrimage to the brewery. I might even start listening to metal if Pig Destroyer had a hand in the collaborative creation of this liquid beauty."
"Consumed a few half-pints (standard serving size) of this really wonderful DIPA - it's big bodied, for sure. Huge assault of grapefruit, pineapple and tropical fruit. Boozy undertones throughout. Moderate bitterness and just an exceptional hop profile throughout. Shame they were out of bombers, but still glad to be able to consume this in > GABF quantities."
""
""
"Overall - Drove 4.5 hours total to get this and glad i got it. Huge flavorful beer done up right. Hop heavy beer with the right amount of yeasts and malts to make it a wonderful beer. Alcohol is masked really well, making it easy to drink the bomber. World class for sure."

"Poured clear dark golden color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Heavy complex citrus and earth hop aroma. Medium to full body with slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy smooth bittersweet flavor with a heavy bittersweet finish of Moderate to long duration."
""
"This is the perfect beer. From the second I poured it you can smell the grapefruit. I split a bottle with my wife (who hates IPAs). She was blown away by it. The best I've ever had hands down. There's no way this is 10.5 abv. There's not a single hint of alcohol in it. Just liquid gold."
""
""
""
"O - probably prefer this over APW, debating whether this is a 5 or not. I think it just may be..."
"I had this at the brewery in a tulip glass. Holy crap is this stuff good. Total ultra smooth hoptastic bomb. This is the only beer I have had lately that I would compare (seriously) to Pliny the Elder. I would not be suprised if this got onto the top 250 in a hurry. I had 2 of these at the brewery and made sure I had a dozen in my trunk before I left. Dark redish brown appearance, floral hopiness and sweet smell, wonderful flavors abound with a perfect balance of sweet and hop with a long lasting piney flavor that sticks around for a while. I though it held up well in the bottles I have had as well. Tasty stuff folks, get one if you can."

"O: 4.25 Yet another great brew by FFF. I'm not surprised, haha. This may be the best balanced DIPA by the Floyds. Other comparables have been mainly a hop bomb of some sort, this may be the most enjoyable throughout."

"Hazy ornage with one finger of white head, sticky eith a bit of lace. Smell is full of hops, citrusy, orange, grapefruit and mango are dominant but fairly fruity in the nose overall, a touch of sugary malt as well. Taste is fruity lots of citrus and tropical fruit, mid palate malty-sweetness that leaves notes of grapefruit/citrus candy mixed with all those hops, quite bitter and finishes a bit dry with lots of tropical fruits. Light to medium carbonation, medium full bodied and fairly sticky with a bit of an oily feel. Awesome stuff here, second favorite of the whales brought by Liam on this evening."

"Tap at Paradiso. Pours a clear bright as hell neon orange. Weaker white foam. Weak swathes of lace. Nose is a bit skunky, some prominent cat pee, very dense dried pineapple and dried papaya. Stickier, tropical. Taste is melon heavy, lots of thick mango and cantaloupe. Palate is dense, lightly nutty and spicy. Mild tannic bitterness. Not very buoyant or quenching. But still yummy with a big focus on aroma hops typical to FFF. Noticeable spicy alcohol after 3 or 4 sips. 8/3/7/4/15=3.7"

"$10 a bottle is a little steep for any ipa. If you're a fan of Zombie Dust, Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer, Alpha King, Aeotara, Apocalypse Cow etc. . . you're very likely to dig on this, even if you've had beers very similar to it from FFF already. It is a great summer beer with a punch."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. Had you given this to me blindly and told me it was Zombie Dust I would have believed you. Point being, it lives up to that level of expectation. Since we’ve had the pleasure of sampling Zombie Dust there are certain obvious differences, but to no real detriment. This guy is much more fusel, boozy, phenolic, and generally strong, but then again it’s about twice the abv. This remains decently well hidden throughout, but is nicely contributory when it comes up every now and again. The tropical fruitiness in the end was astounding, giving sugary sweetness, syrupy thickness, and glorious balance. The nose is not as juicy as it could be, but that is merely keeping it just “awesome”, rather than """perfect""". With too much warmth the booze does take things a touch off base in the flavoring. This is a phenomenal addition to the masterful pale ale lineup, and something I certainly wish I bought more than one bottle of on my visit to the brewpub. Simply awesome."

"The beer poured a copper color with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma was a big shot of pineapple and grass, overall quite sweet. In the initial taste, one gets pineapple, apple, grapefruit, and notes of pepper. In the aftertaste, the dry and pungent hops make an impression. It was a wonderful tart sensation. There was a slight warming impression in the aftertaste that was accompanied by a peppery nature in the back of the throat. In terms of Imperial IPAs, this one is right up there with FFF's Dreadnaught. Really good stuff."
"Clear golden orange with a huge soapy bright white head and tons of lace with decent retention. Huge citrus! Bright, vibrant, piney, pungent, sharp hops. Massive citrus in the taste. This one doesn't hide the hops, as expected. It's definitely a hop bomb but it isn't overwhelming. Highlights the beauty of the hops used. Dry, pungent, resiny, delicious. That's all. This is all Three Floyd's."
""
"Hazy glowing golden orange with a cap of khaki foam, excellent lacing. Smells of mangos, oranges, pine and a little sweetness. Taste tangerines, pine resin, citric pith, papaya, light caramel malt, moderate bitterness, juicy. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, medium weight, very nice. Overall- delicious."

"This arrived via aasher today, just ahead of my birthday. Thank you as always, Al, for the fantastic array of beers! Initially thought this was a Pale Ale but doing a little web searching steers me towards DIPA instead. Putting away my Three Floyds pint glass in favor of a Delirium Tremens tulip. There's a very slight haze cutting through the orange liquid and a frothy cap of white foam sits up top, about 2 fingers tall. Good retention and lacing. Heavy hitting fruit in the aroma with mango, citrus, and some dankness. Not picking up much in the way of malt. Big, biting bitterness grabs on the palette immediately with piney, orange being prominent in the hop flavor. A little sweetness on the back-end could be coming from caramel malt. Definitely picking up on some warming from high ABV with a medium-body and modest carbonation. Thanks again, Al!"

"Whoa confusing... I've been drinking this brew and waited for the last glass to review it. I was thinking that this was a pale ale as stated by the label and somewhere in the 5-7% range. I was shocked when I learned the actual ABV, but that's a testament to the balance of this brew. Nice gold pour with dense white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is aromatic with a few varietals of hops coming to the surface, mainly citrus, lemon rind, melon, and pine come through. The taste is fruity and full of delicious hop flavor up front with light bitterness. Tastes as if this brew is hop bursted as the bitterness is well overshadowed by the aromatic hops. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and peach join the party with a sturdy malt presence towards the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with smooth and somewhat creamy body. Overall, quite a tasty beer with absurd balance and drinkability."

"O - Another solid FFF offering that's not really that special. I'd still stick to Zombie Dust only, but because they don't bottle date I had to watch my friend open ZD after ZD and pour them down the drain right after he got them in a trade. Let's go FFF, you make enough of a killing on your prices you can afford to bottle date or you're doing something wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I liked this quite a bit more than Dreadnaught which I think is seriously overrated. Dreadnaught is a syrupy, barely hoppy mess and Permanent Funeral is what Dreadnaught should have been. The West Coast should like this beer. It probably won't make their top 5, but maybe their top 10."

"Beautiful golden color with white head that fades away quickly. Slight alcohol legs. Huge hop aroma that is heavy on Pineapple and tropical fruits. Bitterness seems lower than 100. Goes down very easy for a ten percent beer. I would recommend everyone that likes hoppy beers seek this one out. Very memorable. Fantastic!"

"This beer is perfection. It ha got to be a imperial Zombie Dust. I am three floyds crazy and this is one of there best ever. I carry this beer and went through all 24 bombers in one day at the bar. I can not believe the aroma of citrus and the flavor they put in this beer. There is so much citrus to this beer it is amazing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer with great label art that I would love to drink again, but I think its just a little hyped. It seems that the loads of hops kind of cover up the lack of sophistication. But, don't get me wrong...I couldn't brew this."

"Sweet tropical fruit, mango and dried pineapple, edge of the glass is sticky like a fruit cocktail cup. Also pretty dank and bitter, a hop blast incarnate. Medium bodied, resiny, slightly syrupy. Big and uncompromising, but very tasty and drinkable."

"Very drinkable, seriously fresh and tropical."
""
"Overall- This one does not hold back for an imperial- the alcohol is in there. The amazing thing is that for as boozy as it is, it does not dominate. Everything holds up to it and matches it well. Perhaps the most perfect balance of any imperial IPA I have had. Very well done Three Floyds. The collaboration with Pig Destroyer is an awesome added bonus. Amazing."
""
""
"O - It's hard to imagine a DIPA that I would like more. I don't know how FFF is able to get that much fresh, citrusy hop flavor into a beer that is almost refreshing to drink - even at 10.5 % ABV. For the hophead, this is a must try in my opinion."
""
"Do not drink this too cold. The taste at first sip was very good but turned to excellent as it warmed. Somewhat similar to Z.D. in aroma but not at all a grapefruit bomb. This one is citrusy but I think more piney in taste. All in all another great ipa from the floyds."
"O - It's a laugh to see """Pale Ale""" on the bottle but I guess I get it in the sense that it's light on the malt, which is a very good thing in this beer. I'd not heard of this beer until today and of the samples I had at the brewery, this is the shining star. Better than Dreadnaught for sure. Maybe equal or close to Zombie Dust (my personal 3F favorite). Dang."

"M - Medium body. Stick and full of resinous hop oils. Light carbonation."
"O - really liked this one. Like zombie dust with more punch."
"Very good DIPA, very drinkable. One of my favorites by FFF, behind ZD."

"First off, I love how Three Floyds tries to confuse people by putting """pale ale""" on the label. I am not being sarcastic, I think it's funny and unique. Secondly, the artwork on the label is awesome. I am a huge fan of the genre of metal that Pig Destroyer play...though I am not a Pig destroyer fan. I tend to like Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin, The Chariot, BTBAM, etc., but never got into Pig Destroyer. Now, let's get to the beer. Pours a nice clear golden orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely citrus fruit and piney aromas. Sweet honey with a ton of hops and just a bit of tropical fruit...mango mostly. Just a hint of malt in the nose. Taste is fantastic. Not overly sweet...just the right amount of sweetness for a DIPA of this ABV. The hops are the most noticeable in this beer. I had a six pack of ZD a long time ago, so can't really compare. Some sticky, malty, honey-ish flavors...but thankfully just a tiny bit. Lovely blend of citrus and tropical flavors...stellar combination of hoppiness. Finish is smooth and kinda dry. Drinkability is very high, as alcohol is well hidden...not hot at all. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but perfectly carbonated. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that I wish I could get more of. I would love to see how this one would do if it had been at The Bistro's DIPA Festival during SF Beer Week."

"This is not a DIPA. This is the big brother to ZD. Unreal taste. Classic 3 Floyds taste. Classic citra mouth. A beer to remember. Unreal. But not a DIPA. This is an amped up pale ale. I would not call this a DIPA. The hop character is way fired up. Clean taste like a ZD."

"Pours beautifully hazy bright orange with a two finger head.smells piney, very tropical fruit, some peach maybe. Taste is also very bright tropical fruits, sweet hops, bright citrus, some biscuit, some licorice, and just the perfect hop bitterness, not too much though and a hint of malt backbone (I guess a hint of malt makes it a pale ale for FFF). I agree I don't see how this isn't an IPA but its amazing. Extremely drinkable, nice velvety mouthfeel, very bright fruit and west coast style hop profile. I wish I could get this again."

"If I'd known how much I would enjoy this I'd have purchased more than one for sure. This is an outstanding DIPA with plenty of tropical citrus hop character, a nice sweet malt body and nicely balanced body. Very well done and worth checking out while it's still around."

"O: A great DIPA. This thing drinks like a 8% beer. Tons of flavour, great aroma. It really reminds me of a HF DIPA meeting a hardcore west coast DIPA. I cannot pin point anything overtly wrong with this beer. Perhaps the ONLY thing is that it isn't showing me anything SUPER different from some other great DIPAs I've had. With that said, it is done almost perfectly. A great amalgamation of DIPA styles."

"F - Initial impressions were great, but the aroma actually worsened as it gave way to the higher alcohol. Deserves a 5 for the label alone, and while its not utterly spectacular this is recommendation that requires no hesitation."
"M: Larger side if medium. Thinner than other FFF DIPA which is nice."

"I can't believe this really says """pale ale""" on the label. No matter, whether you wanna call it a pale ale or an IPA or a double IPA, the fact remains that it's a damn good beer regardless. Similar to a more potent, less citric, and slightly more abrasive Zombie Dust. Three Floyds definitely knows their way around a hop, and this is nothing but proof."

"My first PF, thank you mpayne5! Pours a gorgeous golden orange with one finger of creamy tan head. Holy Shit! What a great smelling DIPA!!! Grapefruit, peach, mango, pineapple and pine needles and faint hints of melon, I could sniff this stuff all day long, and be happy. Taste is very rich and satisfying, a tropical hop explosion, everything I was hoping for and more. A little boozy, but not overpowering. Overall this is another world class DIPA from Three Floyds, I put this one between APW and Dreadnaught. If you can find this one, get it! Three Floyds is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries in the world, and they continue to blow me away with their hop-forward line-up of great brews. Cheers!"

"Overall, I think I may like this one more than Dreadnaught. Though the bottle says it is a Pale, it definitely drinks like a DIPA. Maybe Zombie Dust’s big brother? I really enjoyed the loads of citrus aroma and flavors. Being a fan of aggressive music, you can't go wrong with a brew named after a Pig Destroyer song. I am hoping that FFF will consider adding this brew to their regular line up."

"Overall - Good if nothing distictive. Always a good beer from Three Floyds."

"Very glad to have had the chance to try this one out. Superbly superb!"
"Try it when you can."

"O: Floored."

"D - A really nice beer, although it's not as mind-blowing as I was expecting given some of the other reviews. I could definitely drink this in large quantities, but it doesn't have that intense crackle to it that the best beers do."
""
""
""
"This is a very good limited release beer. For 100 IBUs I was expecting much bitterness, but the bitterness was somewhat mild and the beer was very delectable. However, Southern Tier's 2XIPA is as good, if not better, and the 2XIPA is much cheaper at only about $1.50 per glass compared to $5 a glass for the Permanent Funeral, so I will stick to ST's 2XIPA for my IPA needs."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.50) Really solid beer. It delivers a ton and really just has it all. It boasts a huge bounty of flavor from the hops and if you're looking for crunch, it doesn't leave you asking for more. This is a beer which overshadows anything that comes before or after it. It will be the only thing I drink tonight and I will not be saddened!"
""
""
"Overall - A nice limited release, but I'll be sticking with other FFF brews. They call it a double pale ale, not a double IPA. I can see why. It's hard to believe it's 10.5% ABV though. It's blended extremely well. Even as it warmed up, the taste did not fall off. That's huge for this style. Extra points just for that."
"O - It's no surprise that Three Floyd's knows how to brew great hoppy beers, but this is just absolutely ridiculous -- astonishingly good. Makes Zombie Dust seem like water, this is so intense. Be sure to grab this one while its still around!"
""
""

""

"O) This Mo-Fo gets the job done after a tough work week. If Three Floyds put this in their regular rotation, I doubt there would be anyone complaining."
"o - with so many of these ipas with the insanely great nose, the taste leaves you disappointed since the nose set the bar so high, but this beer...the taste lives up to the nose. truly a master piece for the style. hope that this becomes year round and available locally (hey, i can dream can't i?)."
"O - A very tropical and sweet beer from FFF balanced with the usual FFF hop bitterness. Definitely a unique beer in the FFF profile though with so much juicy and tropical hops. Great collaboration that is definitely worth seeking out."
""
"Overall, this may be the best double IPA Three Floyds has ever brewed. It feels very much like an amped up, imperial Zombie Dust. Bursting with juicy, dank, fruity flavors and a nice clean hop bite, Permanent Funeral is a big, bold beer. The only thing I didn't love was the relatively strong alcohol heat present in the flavor. I'm a fan of high ABV beers but I feel like knocking this down to 8.5 or 9% would make this a more balanced and easier drinking IPA. Still, this is a fantastic and extremely well-made beer with one helluva hardcore label and name."

"Mouthwatering citrus. Lasting bitterness is off the hizzy. Recommended for DIPA fans. Thanks for grabbing this kawilliams81!"
""
""
"Overall: FFF hits another DIPA out of the park, following their others. I don't care if they call it a Pale Ale, its a double Zombie Dust that's heavy on the citrus that is barely balanced by an intense malt presence in the middle of the swig. It's a beer that lives on the precarious edge of balance, which is typical of FFF and definitely worth going out of your way to buy a bottle of. I usually prefer a little more balance to my DIPAs, like from Pliny or NG IIPA, but I am definitely very pleased with how this one came out."
"O - absolutely fantastic, pretty much like Double Zombie Dust. I would gladly make the trip to Munster for this"
""
""
"O- another great dipa from FFF. Very good balance of sweet, citrus and bitterness."
""
"It's an effortless Imperial IPA that favors citrusy hops over all other. Simple in its plan but extraordinary in its results!"

"This poured out as a very nice looking clear orange color with a white head on top. The retention was thin but it leaves a really nice lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer gives off a really nice sweet fruity aroma, plenty of grapefruit on the nose here. The taste of the beer is give off a really nice balance of sweetness with a dominant bitterness in there as well. The fruit flavors of grapefruit and oranges really give this a vibrant citrusy flavor. The mouthfeel is great, really nicely carbonated and has a thinker oily feel to it. Overall this beer is awesome, hoping it can possibly become a regular rotation for FFF some day. Definitely try this beer before its gone."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable for the ABV, although it is slightly sweet. The fruitiness of it overall was great and the slight bitterness really added a little pop that this needed. Definitely an enjoyable DIPA from FFF."
"Overall: I have come to expect nothing but good from FFF with this style. I have to admit they all taste similar to a degree but holy shit I find this one so flavorful and enjoyable that I believe another drive out to the brewery will be needed before these are gone. This is one that I wish they would add to their regular line up because I'd be one happy man."

"(O)- Simply an excellent DIPA. I am always a huge fan when the citrus and fruit coming from the hops is massive and juicy like this one is. It really reminds me of an imperial version of zombie dust."
""
"Fantastic, but not an everyday casual indulgence."
"Verdict: A very intense Imperial IPA from Three Floyds, which doesn't really come as a surprise, but this might be one of the juiciest and pineapple forward beer I've tasted to date. It's massive, it's bold, it's brutal and yet the bitterness is kept in check making this wonderfully drinkable."

""
"O: Would love to see this permanently in stock. Huge fan."
"O: Just an amazingly flavorful brew from 3 Floyd's. This should be the DIPA they brew all the time, even over Dreadnaught and APW. Really felt like a double Zombie Dust. I'd step over my grandmother to get another bomber."
""
"Overall: A really, really impressive DIPA from Three Floyds. Quite possibly their best work yet in that category."
""
""
""
""
"O: Permanent Funeral might be my favorite brew of the style that Three Floyds has put out to date! It's top-notch, and each sip leaves me craving more. Well done!"
"Pours a bright, opaque sunset orange color with decent carbonation and about a finger length head that dissipates to a thin lacing. Smells of pretty bright, juicy tropical fruits like papaya, guava, and pineapple. Also get some resinous citrus fruits like orange and a slight grapefruit. Nice candied sweetness as well. Smells like a big, sweet, citrusy double ipa. Taste is amazing. Starts with bright, clean citrus fruits like orange and grapefruit with some resinous pine that adds quite a bit of abrasive bitterness. Then melds into a nice carmel/candied sweetness, somewhat bready malt backbone. This gives the fruity hop qualities a more juicy-like flavor. Finish brings a slight abrasive bitterness back, but its subdued compared to some of their other dipas. Along with this comes more of the tropical fruit variety. Pineapple, papaya, mango, and orange stand out as well as a great candied sweetness. Also get just a hint of pine. Just the slightest alcohol burn on the end, but no alcohol to smell or taste, which is impressive for 10.5%. A crisp and somewhat clean, refreshing finish that really makes this beer awesome. High medium body with a creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel from the hops, but still very clean compared to other dipas at this strength. I have very high expectations when it comes to three floyds dipas and this one meets it and then some. Outstanding beer."

"stopped reviewing but compelled to do this one. clear golden/light amber w/persistent white head and lace. the nose just pops. huge fresh berry aroma-are these some newfangled hops? also some citrus, tropical fruit. none of that overripe fruit/rotten banana thing i hate in some dipas. just enough pale malt sweetness to showcase these beautifully juicy hops. big lingering bitterness but not sharp or astringent. i love me some dreadnaught but went back to pick up bombers of these. please make this available year round. phenomenal!"
""
"This is such a treat. Didn't have huge expectations on this beer. This is easily one of Three Floyds best beers ever. An Imperial Zombie Dust is a fair assessment. If you can get your hands on this beer then DO IT!!!!"
"Wonderful experience. I immediately wished I had purchased another bottle of this after the first sip!"

"A seriously stupid good DIPA that is aggressive yet tolerable, and a heck of a lot of fun. Really dug this brew a lot, I don't know if I'll ever get to have this again though, that's my only disappointment."
""
"O: 47.5 - I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try some 3Fs beers again as part of CBC 2013, and this beer was a pleasant surprise but, to be honest, I shouldn't have been surprised by its quality; it simultaneously hits hard with hops and sweetness, which, to be frank, is really difficult to pull off well because most sweet """Third Coast""" DIPAs are sickingly sweet for my tastes; in sum, this is another fine example from The Hop Lords"
"An awesome, awesome beer, they again are masters of the hop! I am not worthy."
"Overall this is a SERIOUS DIPA. This is unequivocally the most powerful DIPA, flavor-wise, I've had. Crazy good and definitely something to seek out for hopheads."
