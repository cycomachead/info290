Flavors are of strong citrus juice and grapefruit bitterness followed by some floral undertones.

This beer is a hop bomb, which I'm not complaining about, but it just didn't give me as much of a balanced feel as I'd like so I have to give a slight knock on taste.

Aroma is a snoutfull of citrus and hops with citrus rind being the predominant smell. Taste is an explosion in your mouth of the multitude of hop varieties in this one. Tastes of bitter hops, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, pine and resin. Really nice feel of carbonation on the palate and relatively smooth for an IPA at over 8% ABV. Great job on balance.

The first sip certainly has some hops and citrus to it but it’s smoother than other IPAs in that there’s some interesting flavors that come through. I think “fresh grass” best describes it and it’s quite pleasant. The mouth feel is wonderful with just the right amount of carbonation.

Popping the top I get a very fresh piney citrus waft with a nice sweet backbone under it.  Pours to a cloudy bright orange with a one finger head that recedes to a quarter inch and hangs out. On the taste this brew has an exceptionally smooth citrus and pine taste up front with a sweet middle followed by a citrusy bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is superb with a smooth as silk viscosity and a sharply sparkling carbonation that breaks it up oh so slightly.  Look up IPA in the dictionary and you see this brew.  Nicely masked 8.1 ABV that creeps up on you and gives you a nice glow.  A winner.","mooseisloose","Dec 20, 2014"

The aroma is fresh grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, bubblegum, and honey. The hops are complex and potent with pungent citrus zest blending into a piney fresh lemon and alcohol middle. I don't detect much malt presence except for a slight earthiness throughout.

Perhaps I enjoy their Hop Head Red and Le Freak so much that the West Coast IPA no longer measures up.  The malty taste of alcohol is too strong, yet the red copper color is still inviting.  I avoid it in the store and grab it on tap only when other fine IPAs are not available.  The aroma and taste are no longer as clean as it once was.  Still a good beer, but no longer a stand out.","BeerOpine","Nov 16, 2014"

It's bottle-conditioned to help shelf life for European distribution; otherwise aiming for the same standard, so (and I checked with moderators) goes in the same entry as the native version. Notes are combined from a few tastings, not simultaneous but about a week removed from sampling a bottle of the American version.... Appearance is spot on, the copper of a cloudy Pacific sunset, under a layer of finely bubbled, creamy head, with just a bit of milky residue in the bottle to attest to the refermentation. The nose seems slightly less powerful and less flowery, but still an enticing pine forest with bready notes, a bit of banana (it's not Belgian yeast, though), some subtle spicing, but clean. Flavor to me seems slightly fruitier and less cereal, with juicy apricot, mandarin orange, plus a bit of sweet grapefruit flesh to go with the punch of grapefruit pith of the hops. Aftertaste/feel of pine resin and florals lingers nicely. Similarly substantial and creamy mouthfeel that swallows cleanly. My impression is of a very close fraternal twin.","ManforallSaisons","Nov 09, 2014"

Big blast of hops on the first taste with lots of grapefruit/citrus and a sweet caramel malt. Real nice bitterness on the back of the tongue that lasts a long time.

You can smell the sweetness of the malt, but the alcohol remains hidden to the nose. The taste is aggressively bitter.  There's a hint of caramel,  but that is quickly masked by the tidewater of hops. They coat the tongue. The bitterness stayed for seven counts after swollowing. Pretty intense.

It starts off mellow with just enough hoopiness, but it could bite you in the butt. The citrus notes of all the West Coast hops are amazing. Reminds me of lying on the beaches of California with citrus trees nearby. Even though it has a fairly high IBU count it doesn't taste like it. Something that a normal IPA drinking can enjoy but he/she might want to think about standing up too fast. lol","BeerT3ch","Sep 06, 2014"

Lots of biting grapefruit at first with a pine bed that sets the stage for a healthy caramel malt that brings balancing sweetness and flavors. Taste is quintessential West Coast. Hops explode from the initial contact. Grapefruit and hop oil at first burst on the scene. Big malt core carpets the somewhat abrasive swallow. No alcohol flex and a refreshing. character makes this one came across as a session beer. Then again it is a delicious and aggressively hopped brew. Feel is lighter than it should be. Easy to quaff and enjoy. Stupendous beer. Drinks below it weight class. Tastes above it.","scootny","Aug 29, 2014"

The hop flavor notes goes from an intense citrus rind to a heavy leafy herbal to an intense piney/spruce like character and back again somewhat typical of a great hopped beer. The malt adds some supporting sweetness in the beginning with some bready and yeast like notes. There are some peach like fruit notes with maybe even a slight hint of cherry. The finishing hop flavor takes over and coats the plate with heavy citrus and piney bitterness. A beautiful beer.","stoutman","Jul 27, 2014"

The smell has strong sweet notes mixed with grapefruit hops mixed with floral notes. The smell also has weak hints of pine. The beer taste is surprisingly different from the smell. The taste has strong grapefruit and pine notes with weak floral notes and a bit of malt sweetness to it. The beer also has a slightly yeast backbone that works very well with the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodiedbut is a bit heavy. Biting carbonation with a dry finish. Overall, a fantastic IPA and worth getting. I'll definitely pick this one up again.","HattedClassic","Jun 13, 2014"

The appearance was a dark yellow with a nice sticky head. The smell was nice with a lot hops. The taste was great with mellow taste in the beginning from the malt and then a lot of floral and grapefruit flavors come out in the middle from all the hops. The finish had a bit of a molasses taste which I thought cut the bitterness well. A wonderful beer that I would highly recommend hop-heads to try.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 03, 2014"

The bottle I drank had a best-by date on it that passed a few months ago, and this was one of the last beers I had during a night of drinking, so I probably wasn't primed to appreciate it as much as I perhaps should. Anyway--the hops were strong and flavorful (with a steady malt backbone); mouthfeel is thick and substantial. This is a good, serious IPA.","AmyfaceNYC","Jun 02, 2014"

Slight touch of citrus in the aroma but nothing substantial, mostly piney hops with a touch of caramel and alcohol. Flavor is again piney and resinous with a deeper floral presence, again light on the citrus notes, maybe the slightest hint of orange zest. I usually like more of a balance with my fruit-hop bitters but this one is all bitter hop and it works really well. Light on carbonation with a fairly dry mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers for quite awhile, this is the type of IPA that got me into the style.","Phigg1102","Jun 01, 2014"

4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Pours a slightly hazy medium amber with a slight red cast. Very strong head with exceptional lacing. The nose is a blend of hops - grapefruit and other citrus over a light pine resin overlaying a subtle malt sweetness. The body is almost medium with a nice smooth texture. Normal carbonation level. The outstanding flavor profile is complex and well balanced. Like the nose, grapefruit and other citrus lead with an earthy pine in the background. A biscuit malt sweetness appears in the middle, which rapidly flows into a quite nice tart bitterness. The finish is smooth and a nice tartness lingers. A bit more carbonation effervescence would accentuate the flavor of the finish and the underlying hop resin.","tillmac62","Mar 05, 2014"

3.83,-9.2,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty a nice beer and a pretty standard and nice example of a West Coast IPA, it seemed to be pretty inline with the style, but it lacked that juiciness and brightness that some of the better ones seem to have, but I still thought it was very solid for what it is. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, clean, a little crisp, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these, but that would probably be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good and they were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste wasn't a little more juicy and bright. I don't think I would buy this again, it's a little pricey for what you get and there's more than a few west coast style IPA's that I like more. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. I'm still not sold on Green Flash, but this wasn't a bad beer at all and I thought it was pretty solid for what they were going for. Nice work guys, keep up the solid work. So far this is my favorite Green Flash beer.","StoutHunter","Feb 28, 2014"

This outstanding ipa pours a cloudy deep amber color with a two finger white head that dissolves to a mere film on the beer decent legs and lacing. The aroma is pure California hops. Pine, citrus, tropical and stone fruits, and a decent aroma of weed. It sips clean and pure and very refreshing. There is just enough body to coat the mouth with gorgeous hoppy resin. The flavor is simple and to the point...hops. a little malt on the aftertaste but mostly just glorious hoppy bitterness. This is an outstanding ipa and should be viewed (along with stone and lagunitas) as the benchmarks of west coast ipas.","lochef81","Feb 07, 2014"

A guy can get a bit jaded with this sort of mentality, as many very good beers can still leave one wanting just a little more. On this occasion, I felt this awe and really did get a jolt of beer-hunter enhancing excitement. Admittedly, I didn't think this would be the beer. Then again, Green Flash is pretty well-regarded in terms of flavor if not price. This brew is a dark russet amber color with a decent dose of beige head that threatened to billow over the sides of my American pint glass. Aroma included all the features you'd expect in a top-shelf IPA, quite tropical, certainly citric: Grapefruit rind galore, fresh pine resin, sweet caramel malts, a solid dose of flower shop and spice cabinet. Hits all the marks. Wait until you taste it, however. This one has layers that peel back as you go. Starts with grapefruit and tangerine flesh and rinds, cantaloupe melon, a little red berry (good old Simcoe), tart bright lemongrass, and then BOOM, massive pine sap and pot resin launch a Blitzkrieg. Very aggressive and spicy menthol bitterness that builds and builds, begins like a cough drop and evolves into mouth numbing spruce needles and mustard greens ... There's almost a heat present, and the floral and citrus elements never quite disappear. I get fresh lime juice, perfumed black tea, white pepper ... Just when you think its done, some fruity grape and gummy candy pop in and you wonder how you can still taste something so subtle amidst all the oily resins and sour fruit wash. The malt backbone manages to protrude into one's awareness despite the hop attack, some light toffee and toast. Medium body, its a tad chewy but not enough to escape the impression that this is a hop bomb as opposed to something sweet. One of the most pine-laden and bitter IPAs I've tried to date, yet redolent with all kinds of fresh juicy fruit flavors. If this is such a world beater, what must Pliny taste like? Someday I shall find out. For now, Green Flash has a wide distribution network and thank God.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 31, 2014"

4.35,3.1,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"This beer is hops, hops, and more hops! Definitely a West Coast IPA with a very clean hop bite and a lingering resinous hop aftertaste. This one leans more towards the piney hops rather than a strong citrus flavor with a very in your face hoppiness. While the bartendress warned me that it was really aggressive I really enjoyed it. Another fantastic brew from Green Flash which continues to impress.","brurevu","Dec 12, 2013"

4.66,10.4,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Deep amber with a good finger of off white head. Nice smelling IPA some sweet malty under notes but this brew is dominated by delicious hops. I’m picking up on heavy pine notes as well as some citrus in the aroma. A nice hoppy flavor and a bit of hop bitterness as is to be expected in a beer like this. The flavor to me is primarily grapefruit with some pine resin more in the aftertaste. These hoppy characteristics are balanced out quite nicely by the solid caramel malt backbone to this brew. This is definitely a hop forward beer though, just the way I like ‘em. A damn solid west coast IPA that goes down surprisingly easy and is quite refreshing considering it is a 7.3% brew.","CA_brewster","Dec 05, 2013"

Make no mistake, this is an impressive West Coast take on the style, but it's so different from the usual offering in so many ways. Due to its extreme bitter profile, it's far from balanced or applicable for everyday drinking in my routine. Nevertheless, it's a perfect example of Green Flash doing what they do best - getting the hop profile, turning it up to 11, and somehow make it drinkable throughout. Recommended for those wanting more intense hoppy beers.","magictacosinus","Nov 14, 2013"

Pours moderately hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity of hop notes with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Large amount of pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, citrus zest/rind, pine, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with minimal cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! All around awesome complexity of hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very crisp and smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

I've gradually become harsher on grading beer (especially IPAs, as they make up one of my favorite styles) and it is obviously reflected in the final score. However, let it be known that this beer is heads and shoulders above any other run-of-the-mill American IPA swill that so many pop-up breweries are releasing. But I digress. Would I drink it again?

Like many, this beer still benefits from extreme freshness, and even though it was still in code, it felt as though it lost an edge. When within three months of bottling, this is one of the best readily available west coast style IPAs in my market.","ryan1788a5","Sep 18, 2013"

The smell is piney with hints of orange and passion fruit. Taste is similar but has a good bit of bite. Yet there's an undertone of sweetness that I detect now that I didn't notice in the past. Maybe my palate has changed, but I liked the drier sensation. Still, a classic and a good go-to DIPA.","Qbdoo","Aug 31, 2013"

Once you get over the 7% range you start venturing into the Double IPA valley, which is by no means a bad thing. Good brew nonetheless. Looking for more brews from this place.

Very malty with caramel and toffee notes. Huge pine resin on the back end that really sticks around. Full body with moderate carbonation, finishes super dry. That dry bitter finish compromises the drinkability.

Hazy with 3 fingers of bone white head that fell slowly to a thick collar and cap with a nice skin on top. Lots of effervescence. Just beautiful. Nose is sparkling with floral hops, grapefruit, some tropical, lots of citrus. lemon and lime. A really deep malt spine. Caramel, toffee and bread. No alcohol on the nose. A graceful light pine and I do smell a little yeast. Taste is excellent. Fruity hops, orange, delightful bitter, juicy tropical fruits, good bread and caramel. Simple and delicious. Drinks so easy, you definitely want more than one. Finishes with a light coating of resin and oil for a piney aftertaste with a little bread and sweetness. This was a truly great IPA that had enough hop bitter to tempt you into each sip but not enough to sting you for it. I really liked this.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

While this may have been one of the better IPA's back when, its overly aggressive flavor, and feel just renders your taste buds useless for a while. Though if you're in the mood for that kind of beer, this is it, and much more so than palate wrecker in my opinion.","Omnium","May 29, 2013"

This means that much more coming from someone who is not a hop head and doesn't drink IPA all that often. This is an exceptional beer no matter which way you look at it. I would strongly recommend this to intermediate level craft beer drinkers and above, as it may be too aggressive for a beginner, but it is outstanding. I can't say enough good things about it.","TheCondor","May 27, 2013"

It was very dense and allowed little to no light penetration. On top there was voluminous head the color and apparent look of crushed limestone. Looked great in the glass. The smell up front was lots of dark resin and very dank. There was a good amount of caramel sweetness to balance. As the beer opened up, there was good grassy smells and some citrus: mainly grapefruit and lemon oils. The taste very much like the nose. There was a good sweet caramel malt, but it was definitely a big, bitter hop bomb. There was lots of big citrus fruit like oranges and limes, but also some big pine and mint flavor as well. It did get a tad astringent, but only ever so slightly. The beer had great body overall with a dry and bitter finish. No ethanol burn to it at all. Overall, this is an excellent and big IPA. They almost went too far, but kept it overall in check. Very tasty brew..","estlinska","Apr 20, 2013"

Hops lent a unique flavor profile also drying the beer up well. Bitterness was a little on the sharp side for my preference and a little over carbonation contributing to that sensation.

A nice big hoppy beer, quite bitter that plateaus right away, nice hop characters with a little spicy (but not chewy), a bit of citrus but more like rind and pith bitter citrus, and just enough malty sweetness to give it a base so it doesn't get astringent. Nice IPA.","jlindros","Apr 10, 2013"
4.59,8.8,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,"This is my first legit tasting of a West Coast designated IPA. It poured beautifully with a picture perfect head. Slightly murky amber orange that tells me we are packing natural flavor here. Smells like hoppy bread dough. Wonderful hop flavor follows which takes me to a new place with every mouthful. Grass, dandelion, grapefruit, resin, mineral- a ubiquitous profusion of hop flavors continue to evolve. The label says """Extravagantly Hopped""". Well, that about says it all. This beer is so well crafted it is wasted on a neophyte so save this for your well versed IPA connoisseurs. Overall it is a magnificent beer that is sure to impress any IPA fan.","FinerThings","Apr 10, 2013"

On my second pour into the glass, I took as aggressive a pour as possible, and for a brief moment, there was literally ALL head in the glass. Woah. The nose has more going on than I can properly parse apart, but the bottle text hits me in the lane with an assist: pine, florals, grapefruit (rind!). Having been properly educated, I can detect these widely varying smells. The taste is equally complex: strong hop bitterness with the individual flavors rotating on a wonderful beer merry-go-round. The ride doesn't stop with the swallow, and really keeps going for quite a bit. Impressive. Not as sessionable with all the intensity of the bitterness, but certainly an important IPA experience.

Poured an unfiltered orange brown into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Lots of sediment floating around and lots of bubbles trickling up. Large off white head with good retention. Aroma was dank and resinous. I could definitely tell there was a lot of complexity in the taste and that it was a well-crafted beer. However, it wasn't terribly balanced and it seemed like the bitter and piney elements were at war with the sweeter malt characteristics instead of bringing the flavors together. I could appreciate the number of different things going on but this particular bottle didn't live up to my expectations.","Fusion7777","Feb 28, 2013"

4.34,2.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Mostly clear amber-orange pour with an off-white two finger head with great retention and crazy lacing. This is a hop bomb in every way. Huge hoppy, floral nose with tons of grapefruit, pine, and resin up front along with hints of tropical fruit, and perfume. The taste is complex and just as hoppy. Loads of bitter, resiny, mouth puckering goodness with hints of grapefruit, pine, fresh hops, orange peel, along with some subtle mango and apricot. The mouthfeel is thick and oily with a tangy, bitter, dry finish. With that said, there's just enough of a sweet caramel maltiness to add at least a measure of balance to this insanely bitter beer. Overall, this ranks right up there with all the elite hop bombs and truly lives up to its name.","beerdrifter","Jan 27, 2013"

Pineapple and mango, herbal notes, balanced perfectly by slightly sweet bready malt, and finishes with gentle and pleasant grapefruit rind bitterness.

Aroma is definitely hoppy with hints pepper, floral, and pine balanced against the citrus and grapefruit notes. Taste is excellent--combining the citrusy taste with the hops and malt. The finish is hoppy with a huge bitterness that lingers wonderfully. Not for everyone as some may not enjoy the bitterness, but I think it makes for a terrific finish. Medium body with good carbonation. Just a great balance for this style. Highly enjoyable.","ScottieD","Dec 01, 2012"

At no point were any of the bittering elements overwhelming, which is easy with such a strongly flavored beverage. We found the nose to be a bit subdued, but this did improve in depth with some warmth. This beer is excellent for the style, and surprisingly balanced for its geographical origin. This, my friends, is the definition of “West Coast IPA”, and the standard to be compared against.","TheBrewo","Nov 12, 2012"

4.97,17.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This brew poured a cloudy orange color with some sediment floating in it. The head was a full two fingers and pure white. It dissipated relatively quickly, leaving mild lacing on the glass. On the nose, I got lots of fresh hoppy goodness with some citrus as well. This smelled like something that I’m really going to like. On the first sip, I get some definite hops with grapefruit flavors, but more intense than I expected. It was also a bit on the oily side towards the end. Pine came up next. Hops definitely overwhelm the palate and the malt gets lost, which is totally fine by me. The moderate carbonation really went well with the flavors of the beer. The finish lingered for awhile with the sticky, grapefruit flavors. Also, the booze was really well hidden in the brew. I could put away a few of these without any problem. I would definitely have this again. This is a brew that really helped my hop head craving.","mgironta","Sep 26, 2012"

3.83,-9.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Lightly hazed amber-orange colour, one finger of off white head, really good retention and some lace. Smell is a mix of citrusy pine and toasty malt, biscuit like, grapefruit and orange with a faint suggestion of alcohol. Taste is full of dry citrusy hops, mango, orange and grapefruit, big bitterness with a bit of malt toward the finish and a little warming alcohol. Light carbonation, medium body, thick and resinous at times, good mouthfeel. For an IPA that was nearly 4 months old to the day this was really good and probably stellar when fresh, so I will change my review upon a fresher bottle if need be but I would still drink one 4 months old.","peensteen","Sep 21, 2012"

The nose is a very malty sweet with hints of hops and grapefruit. I like the taste better. Begins with a malty forefront with the grapefruit hops dominating in the middle and ending the same way it began with a malty hoppy balance. The mouthfeel is a medium thick.

There are some tiny bubbles that can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left behind as the head dissipates. The aroma is of citrus hops and sweet malts. There's a bit of that piney hop aroma in there as well. It's such a nice, hop forward IPA despite having two months on it. Those piney and citrus hops really come through in the flavor. There's a nice sweet and bready malt backbone to this beer. It hits all the taste notes of a solid West Coast IPA. The alcohol is well hidden here. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. I have yet to be disappointed by Green Flash.","acevenom","Jul 31, 2012"

The amount of sediment swirling around depends on how careful you are with the pour. A reasonable head forms on top. Time for the aroma! It’s big and all hops. If you like an aromatic IPA, this is your baby. The flavor is insanely hoppy. The malt does not come through the layer after layer of hop notes. The aftertaste is big and bitter. You really have to be IPA conditioned to handle this beer, it’s a real hop monster. An amazing experience, but I prefer a more refined IPA.","iSip","May 29, 2012"

A romantic white thick head sat on top of this mossy green/brown ale for the length of its life. Very murky beer with signs of alligator bubbles brewing up from the bottom, feeding the slight carbonation of the drink. The scent is amaaaazing... full of hops and flowers, and not much else. No fruity side to this... just straight hoppy beer. The taste is heaven served both cold and when warmed in the room. Overall, this is probably the greatest IPA i've ever had, and I see why Green Flash has earned its reputation. I will come back to this beer whenever I have a chance, and if you haven't checked out this San Diego legend, do yourself a favor.","shigg85","May 18, 2012"

I have read reviews that claim this is not quite a """west coast ipa," but I feel they may have become too blinded by over hopped versions of that style which border on Imperial. This does not. The multi-hop mix polished the tongue and sides of the mouth on the way down with both bitter and grapefruit sense. The nose is pure hop, except a hint of caramel malt in the back ground which is delivered in the taste... could be just a tad more complex. The taste is all the hop necessary for the style, but a medium body w/caramel malt sense that SEEMS heavier due to probably a caramel 60 or more sense. It lingers. It seduces. Delightful.","kencarman","May 12, 2012"

Poured at around 55 degrees into a pint glass. Oh my, what a fluffy little pillow of white head, and the smell is amazing. Piny floral citrus-y hoppy goodness. The color in the glass is a honey amber and I swear it almost glows. I couldn't wait to pop the top but I find myself just staring at the beer in the glass, marveling at how clear and radiant it is, like liquid sunlight. Finally, the first sip. Grapefruit tartness, pine dryness, and just a hint of earthy/fruit sweetness to balance the green bitterness - overall very balanced considering it's all hops, all the time. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. As I sip, and it's hard to sip - this is a Very Drinkable beer and I would have no clue as to the 7.3 ABV based on taste alone - the glass is nicely striated with strong lacing and remains pleasantly fragrant all the way to the end. IPAs are one of my favorite styles and this might just be my new favorite IPA. Thank you, San Diego!","RescueKitty","Mar 06, 2012"

The nose is biting grapefruit rind, hops, and fresh pine, very nice. The flavor follows with bitter citrus and explosive hops that refresh and entice another quaff.

3.85,-8.8,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Pours clear light orange with a 1 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is a total hop bomb: herbal, floral, citrus zest. Taste is also all about the hops with citrus zest and herbal/floral hop flavors battling for dominance. There is a somewhat assertive hop bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. Unfortunately, this beer was flat as hell and that made it a bit of a chore to drink. Overall, this is a good IPA that blasts your nose and mouth with hops of all kinds.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 24, 2012"

I'm so glad that I can get Green Flash in Tampa now, this is an absolutely top-tier IPA, and very affordable compared to 8 dollar Sculpin bombers.","shand","Feb 09, 2012"

4,-5.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured the classic reddish-brown body w/ two-finger white head that dies slow and leaves lace patches. Very floral/piney/citric aroma, and I think a touch of grape which I usually detect in only DIPAs, and some oakey and sweet caramel malt. Body is the same as it's medium-to-heavy, has a good smooth, almost creaminess to it, the bread and sweet malts are nice complements as they are underneath a powerful citric and floral hop punch that leaves a lingering crisp finish and it tastes like some grape notes on the finsh as well. Good ABV for an IPA that wasn't a hop bomb and didn't overpower my tastebuds/retained a nice balance. Classic IPA that you can always fall back on.","clayrock81","Dec 30, 2011"

I'd compare this beer to the Firestone Union jack in that it has a deeply enjoyable bitterness balanced well with mainly grapefruit and other citrus. At 7.3 percent alcohol, the west coast IPA is a beer you could drink more than one at a time, and at about $8-9 for a 4 pack, it won't break the bank. Overall, a surprisingly enjoyable beer and another standout California IPA.","BenHesk12","Dec 05, 2011"

The initial punch it packs, as I said, is quite strong - stronger than most IPAs I have - but I still really enjoyed it, all the subtle flavours. I would definitely have it again.

The aroma really highlights the West coast American IPA style with waves of grassy, piney, and citrus hop notes. The taste of the beer is deeply hoppy, especially on the swallow. During the drink, there's nice malt profile to keep the heavy hopping in check. The swallow leaves your tongue heavily covered in resinous hop oils, so I wouldn't recommend starting with this beer at the beginning of a drinking session. Overall, this is a nicely hopped beer that hop-heads in St Louis are excited to finally have access too. Given the higher ABV (7.3%), this would be a dangerous beer to have a few of unless you have a ride home.","jmvecchio1","Oct 10, 2011"

An overall gret brew.","HOPPYKC","Sep 12, 2011"
4.25,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5," The taste of West Coast IPA is very good with some nice zesty flavors -the hops have a sort of orange tase which is also herbal and mildly acidic grapefruit accent which brings to mind a tangelo as the combination of tangy sweet and bitter reverberate. I like the way the malt sweetness is subtle and it is a generally dry bitter combo with a nice acidity to bring you back for more. The spice accent is slightly peppery and adds dimension to the mildly dry finish. Overall I think this is a great beer, I think it pushes the alcohol and verges on an Imperial IPA with the bitterness level but it isn't too sweet so I would say it fits the style very well.","Slatetank","Sep 12, 2011"
4.03,-4.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: The bitterness seemed a bit much and without much in the way of malt sweetness it just seemed to be a bit much.

The smells are of hops and lots of them grapefruit, pine, and underneath I get some caramel malts. Body is medium. For an older IPA, this is still pretty hoppy not the super hoppy experience I had on tap but there are plenty of piney and grapefruit tastes in there, there is also a slightly sweeter / caramel flavor which I didn't notice with the overpowering hops while this was fresh.

I wouldn't say it's balanced (damn hop-heavy) although the malt carries the amazing hop blend quite nicely. The resinous mix hangs in the mouth for an eternity while at the same time begs for the next sip.

I’m not putting it down a whole lot, though: hell, if I could homebrew anything like this, I’d be a happy man. All in all, it’s good beer that’s sitting on the edge of greatness.

It's incredibly hoppy and certainly bitter as hell, but the 95 IBUs that it claims to have on the bottle isn't overbearing or unpleasant in any way after the initial sip. Again the malt is hard to find in the taste, but this beer doesn't really hurt too much from the lack of balance. It finishes dry after a fairly clean, somewhat crisp mouthfeel.

Nose is quite sweet but still with a nice balance between a light malt and crisp, lively hops. Aromas of mango and orange. Full bodied and rich mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Carbo is too low. Super bitter palate! The fairly rich malt tries to cut the hopiness but, happily, to little or no avail. You can count all 95 IBUs in this one! Mostly grapefruit and pine flavors but the malt does tease out some lighter lemon zest and mango notes.

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. The flavor on this one was very hop forward and it lets you know that even upon first smelling it. The citrus aspect in the flavor is a nice touch as compared to being pine overload.

Really good retention on this guy, the head sticks around for a while and leaves sticky soapy lace. Really a dry piney smell on this. Bitter hops through and through. Slight citrus aromas round it out with citrus peel and grapefruit with grassy aromas to really sum it all up. A little bit more of a subtle flavor than what the aroma leads on. However, this is really balanced with a prominent grassy hop flavor and a grape fruit finish. Really floral and earthy flavors on this one. The mouthfeel is light with sharp carbonation and a great hop flavor. At 7.3, I've been trained to think of this as kind of light. Nice and easy to drink, really a star.","Bendurgin","Jan 16, 2011"

3.59,-14.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"West Coast IPA pours somewhere between a deep orange and the first stages of brown, depending on how much light is hitting the glass. The off white head only ever reaches two fingers in height. It doesn't stick around for too long either, and lacing is present, but not remarkable. The nose is classic California IPA, minimal to no malt (I think I can pick up on just a hint of caramel in this one), and a massive dose of tropical citrusy aromas. Green Flash gets extra credit for producing an IPA that's particularly pungent. Unfortunately it doesn't taste as remarkable as it smells. Caramel is a little bit more present here than in the nose, and a rather pronounced bitterness announces the imminent arrival of grapefruit and pineapple citrus notes. It's good, it just doesn't do much of anytning to distinguish itself from any of the other west coast style IPAs that I've had. The body is impressively solid for a beer that's largely devoid of a malt presence. The carbonation, while solid, I think could stand to be a little bit more energetic . Green Flash West Coast IPA is a fine beer (though I think maybe a little too bitter relative to it's hop flavor punch), but there's just really not much to recommend it over some other IPAs.","axeman9182","Nov 18, 2010"

4.32,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4," An aggressive pour delivers two fingers of white fluffy head resting proudly atop an amber colored ale. Lacing galore as the head falls to a thin cap that maintains for the remainder. A tint of gold is revealed when held to the light. Truly a beauty of an IPA and strangely dark for an ale boasting West Coast in the name. Sweet candy hops come through in the nose highlighted with light floral aromas. The hops become stronger as the ale draws closer to room temperature. Orange and grapefruit become more and more prevalent. The tip of the tongue gets a nice treat of sweet grain and hop resins. The pallet becomes coated boldly with hop oils of bitterness. Sticky hops lasting in the after taste proving worthy of the west coast name. The very slight evidence of caramel remain dry but pay homage to the style. West Coast IPA is quite a quaffer, but heed the 7% ABV dong your best not to kill the entire growler to you can still respect beer.

The taste is a bit of a step down though, in my opinion. The hop bitterness is extremely intense, and a bit too rough around the edges. Citrus is there with a moderate malty sweetness. In the end, though, the overload of bitterness just seems a bit unrefined to me - not enough balance. Load it with hops, sure, but give me something there with it to complement it.

This beer has more attitude than Stone Ruination and Lagunitas' Double but remains somehow dry, crisp in its power.

The smell of this beer is exactly what I would expect out of a west coast style IPA, the floral aroma comes through very solidly along with the bite from the piney scent. Just very fresh in general and entices you to indulge after a long deep smell. The taste does not dissapoint after the strong smell. It has an intense spicy flavor, they used a ton of hops but instead of trying to balance the hop bitterness with some maltiness they used a few different kinds of hops in the beer, citrus flavor hits me pretty well along with the pine I smelled initially. The flower aroma didn't manifest itself as much as in the smell but that is definitely no detriment to the flavor at all. This beer every feels good in my mouth, its not super smooth or anything but that spiciness in the taste has a distinct feel when its in your mouth, almost a tingly feeling before you swallow it which I think is pretty standard with any decent IPA. I found this beer very drinkable, but I also want to reiterate that I love IPA in general and I can drink dIPA all night.

This beer was served from a bottle into a pint glass in a local bar in the D.C. area. Immediately, I noticed the hop aroma. It was clear and present. The head was there but thin and disappeared as I drank. It was light copper and relatively clear. As I drank the beer, the bitterness grew in my mouth. There wasn't an aftertaste in the classic sense of it, it was just building on me. Even with the increased hoppiness, the beer was still drinkable. A good example of an American IPA.","drabmuh","Aug 25, 2009"

This brew pours to a cloudy orange yellow color with a thick off white head that has great retention and leaves a good deal of lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is what you would expect from a west cost IPA, very hoppy nose that gives of a strong pine scent with floral notes, seems that the Centennial hops come out more for me. Slight malt profile there but very much overtaken by the hops. The flavor is nice, the bitterness is there and is aggressive but I thought it would be just all hop but there is a nice malt flavor there as well. This is not to say that this brew is not over the top as far as hops goes, suppose it is, but it plays nice with the other flavors. The hop presence says on the tongue for a long while after. Also mentioned the malt flavor, it comes across semi-sweet with caramel coming to mind. Brew drinks very easy, have limited myself to one per sitting but could easily have a couple. Finishes somewhat dry. Very nice brew, though I do feel that there are others that are as good if not better with a better price point, imagine distributing to the east coast and the newness of the product is driving the cost up ... plus the hop bill.","Stimack","Apr 29, 2009"

I love hops and hop bitterness. This beer could just use a tiny bit more malt sweetness to express a pinch more flavor for my tastebuds. I respect Green Flash's choice in the recipe, but it's just ever a wee bit less enjoyable for me than other entries in the style.

The flavor is definitely what I would expect, with a great hop bitterness on the end -- certainly a unique bitterness. I don't know if I would say it's as challenging as IPAs from Russian River, Stone, or AleSmith, but it's certainly a pleasure to drink. The mouthfeel is light, with moderate carbonation.

Medium-bodied, just about the same story in the mouth but the tactile dimension gives it more range. The grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus remains at the head of the class, pine, orange pekoe tea, violets, bitters follow on. Small sized portion of apricot, peach, nectarine fruit.

The aroma is hops, mostly apricot and mango but also a bit off fresh cut grass. Not surprisingly, hops dominate the aroma, leaving my tongue in anticipation of what was about to come. The flavor is big hops. Dried Apricots are the major flavor with hints of mango, pine and grass. I have to say that it almost has a fake apricot flavor to it. A bit strange to me.

Looks excellent. Huge, frothy head that takes its time dissolving, over a nice amber beer. Excellent lacing. Looks exactly how an IPA should. Nose is great as well. Extremely spicy hops, both piney and fruity. Light toffee malt, but this is unquestionably a malty brew. Aromas are maybe a touch mild. Flavor's a hop bomb, and it's a total surprise given the fairly smooth nose. Huge drying hops up front, and this one is just hoppy as hell throughout. Drying, piney, hoppy bitterness all over the place. Light breadiness. Maybe a hint of malt in the background. Honestly, it might be a touch unbalanced for me, with the hops overwhelming just a bit too much to make it a masterpiece. Feel is excellent, with great body and good carbonation. The drinkability takes a slight hit because of the huge hopiness, but it's still one I would definitely enjoy again.","soupyman10","Jul 16, 2008"

Mouthfeel has a good body but my beer is pretty flat. I think I got a dud bottle. Going to have to grab another one.

Poured in to my Sam Adams pint glass a mild hazy orange, with a clingy, large white head, and tiny pieces of sediment floating here and there. Nose gives off a perfume of pungent, oily hops, pine tree, hints of citrus, and fresh cream. Taste is full of complexities, many of which include some of the smells above. The most remarkable aspect of it is the hop flavor, which comes in waves, and leaves your taste buds a bit numb and beaten up. Body is thick, and oily...pretty big and bold for this style. Although the flavors are really strong and come right at you, I could probably put four or five of these back easily. This is a very good IPA IMO. I have to admit that I have not been very impressed with any of the Green Flash big beers that I have tried (Stout and DIPA). This one on the other hand is a sure winner, and one that I will be buying again in the future. Cheers","jamie2dope","Jun 09, 2008"

Numerous suspended chucks worth considering. The smell is aggressive floral and piny with a balanced sweetness to it. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is primarily tangy from the hops and there's a nice lingering resin texture. Full flavored, the taste is overwhelmingly a citrus hop; grapefruits and tangerines. Wow, really well done. Nothing left up to interpretation here!! and there is nothing shy about it either. Really well done...a boat load of quality ingredients in this one.

West Coast is a darker IPA in the glass, bordering on a medium-dark caramel tone that eerily reminds me of the locals' leathered skin when I lived in America's Wang, Florida. The smell is a smack of resin, intermitten with a catty note. Not unpleasant, but it does have an intensity that speaks of its west coast roots. After a couple sips you can really get a handle on the hops. They rampage around the tongue and assault it with hits of pine, citrus, grapefruit zest, cut grass and once again that racy twang of hemp. Mmmm. Malt is not forgotten though, and lends a weight to the body, resulting in a full mouth-feel. The finish goes on all week and makes this a beer to savor, even if you are sessioning it.

Fresh citrus explosion to the nose with mostly grapefruit. Green grassy hops and funky cannabis resin. Taste is also great. It carries on with the hop assault. Again, quite green and resinous. Big citrus and some pine as well. A little biscuity malt is all there is to keep this from going way overboard, though it's already pushed the limits enough. Tiny hint of alcohol peaks through. Great bitterness, solid medium body. Had the hop power of a IIPA minus the need for tons of malt to back it up. Oily, resinous, not thick. Definitely tingles the tongue and has a dry finish. Not the most drinkable but the hop fix of all hop fixes quite possibly when it comes to an IPA. Classic stuff, here.","ncvbc","May 04, 2008"

The nose has plenty of bitter hops, pine and bitter herb, some crystal malt. Moderate hop aroma as well, with some citrus. The palate opens plenty bitter with a pleasing, resiny pine character, along with citrus pith (grapefruit). A definite crystal malt character is present, with a little toffee and a touch of caramel. Drying, bitter, resiny on the finish, this beer is medium-light with medium-medium high carbonation that's a little too much IMO, hurting the mouthfeel a little bit.

At the finish there's a distinct but brief resiny bitterness. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth.

Good beer, how it can win out over Stone IPA is beyond me. They must be same """judges""" that did not elect Chris Carter to the pro football HOF this last vote.

Probably would have given the appearance score a 4.5 but there were tons of particles (yeast?, don't think this is bottled conditioned) floating around the brew. The aroma is of a nice floral and piney hop, some bready malt noticable. The taste is bitter grapefruit rind, can't really pick up any other flavors after that. Must say it is a little harsh. The feel is light and fizzy, and finshes with a harsh bitterness. An IPA for those who love bitter grapefruit hops.

Lots of citrus in the nose, with a hint of sweetness that isn't nearly as present in the taste. Oily hops with a huge grapefruit flavor nearly overwhelm the malt, giving it a slightly one-dimensional quality, though an enjoyable one. The hops really stick to the palate, leaving a long-lasting bitterness. This is a good, solid IPA, maybe even a great one. I've had better, but I've also had much worse.","largadeer","Oct 01, 2007"

In the finish there is a pleasant and lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. The 7% ABV is barely noticable.

The hops is by far and away the dominant taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Coats the tastebuds....wouldn't appreciate a Pilsner after this one!!! Very little alcohol taste.

The smell is assertively hoppy but backed by a fair noseful of biscuity malt smell. The hops assault the tongue but, again, the malt sweetness rounds things out fairly well. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. The hops overtake the tongue quickly and this doesn't strike me as an all-nighter in the drinkability department.

I can see bits of yeast sediment floating around in my glass, which I didn't expect from this beer. Oh, well. The aroma here is all pine, all the time. There may be a trace hint of grapefruit in there somewhere, but it's drowned out by all the trees. Hoppy, hoppy, hoppy. And the taste is the same way. Hoppy, piney, and even a tad bit sweet. Tart and tangy pine up front, a bit of evening out sweetness in the middle, and a crazy hop finish with lots of lingering bitterness. Certainly not for the faint of hops. Mouthfeel is nice and sturdy, although it also has a syrupy feel to it which is ultimately overcome by the strong hop finish. I wouldn't necessarily call this a highly drinkable IPA. It's more of a hop-head's dream come true, but I don't think it's really all that accessible for non hop fans. Still, I like it, and I'll revisit this beer in the future.

One word PERFECT. Strong classic west coast hop bomb. Enormous citrus hops, pine resiney goodness, huge flavors, nothing subtle here, Sooo smoothe, crisp, perfect fullness and feel.

Caramel flavours melded nicely with the fruity, slightly powdery, hops. Solid malt provides a good balance here, while still letting the hops do their thing.

There is the same refreshing citrus in the taste. There is a bitter hop bite in the end, but my tongue is left with a candy finish. It is a full tasting, well-carbonated beer.

I really love many of the San Diego breweries and Green Flash is yet another exceptional example. I vividly recall my first taste of this beer which was on tap at Najas and me and my brother were blown away and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

All of the lemon, and orange reminds me of a fruity breakfast cereal in a good way since the malt comes in just when it should.

Hop flavor dominates-almost overwhelming depending on your liking. Wants to strip my tongue of taste buds-AND I LOVE IT! Malty base behind it all. Great mouthfeel-very well balanced overall.

There wasn't an awful lot of sticky lace, some, but most was just kind of there. The color was a gorgeous light amber. The smell was a sweet hoppy smell.

I even get a touch of sweetness, strawberry like, and faint. The taste hits me with pineapple and grapefruit again, right int he front, developing some peach and other stone fruit flavors. The whole time the grapefruit and pineapple stay with you though, and it finishes bitter, reminding you each time you swallow that it's a big IPA.

It does have enough malt to maintain a presence, though. The ABV is sneaky, as it declines to overtly show itself, but it is there, do not doubt.

Incredibly bold hop aroma, cascade-y and centennial-y and a couple others I can't quite nail -- strong pine notes over a thick base of citrus. Tastes like all those, with the lemon aspect coming out a bit more strongly in the flavor than in the smell. A little sweet at the outset and full-bodied, but finished with quite a stiff bitterness. A little over the top, in fact, even given the clear prominence of the malty sweetness. That's the only thing keeping this from supreme drinkability; the hop aroma really makes me want to come back for more each time I put it down.","PeatReek","May 29, 2006"

Nice carbonation in the form of tiny, tiny bubbles that keep on coming for a while. Aroma of spicy, grassy hops, along with a hint of grapefruit and just a hint of sweet, biscuity malt. The hugely assertive hoppiness on the palate is offset just enough by the sweet malt to keep this beer from being over the top. The hops are grassy and bitter, with just a hint of anise lurking behind the scenes. Body is substantial and just a tad sticky, providing a good vehicle for the lupulin to coat the tongue.

It smells like a west coast IPA, with tropical hops (grapefruit, mango) and dank, resiny hop oils. On the palate it is medium and quite smooth with a big tropical hop profile, contributing grapefruit, mango, and hop leaf, and leaving a healthy bitterness along the way. Despite the ABV, this is an easy drinking beer for those looking for a west coast hop fix and my only complaint is that it could have had more of a malt background.

Very floral, spicy, somewhat piney and candy-like in aroma, attention mostly focused around the hops. Well, there's no false advertising going on, this is certainly a """West Coast I.P.A.""". Predominantly hoppy and bitter, however, some tea-like malt sweetness comes through mid-palate, adding some depth and a further bit of toastiness comes through nearer the finish. But the obvious attention-getter of this ale is the hops and their orientation to the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. Playful carbonation accentuates the long, bittering finish on this one.

It has an intensely bitter hop flavor that goes down slow and warms on the finish. THe malt bill provides a stable balance and an elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking IPA. It has good malt flavor and a heavy hitting hop character.","WesWes","Mar 24, 2006"

I'll stick to putting Stone's IPA in my Stone IPA glass from now on and pass on this brew.","Boilermaker88","Mar 24, 2006"

3.9,-7.6,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Beautiful appearance. Great head retention and lacing. Massive assault of pungent, resinous, grassy, and floral hops in the nose. Medium-full bodied with a perfectly crisp carbonation. Firm, toasty/bready malt base. Layer upon layer of resinous hop flavor. Bracing bitterness. Finishes a bit too resinous, and that tends to hold what bitterness is there for just a little bit too long. West Coast IPA? No doubt!!! Be forwarned then, if you're NOT a hophead, this one will slap you senseless! :)","NeroFiddled","Mar 03, 2006"
4.18,-0.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and satisfying. There's a tight, mellow carbonation that really acts as a nice catalyst making this beer easy to drink down. Another solid IPA from the great state of California and one I would be drinking more often if it was readily available. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the hookup once again.","orbitalr0x","Mar 01, 2006"
3.68,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours an amber color with a small head that is gone fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of all US hops - citrus and pine - with almost no malt aroma. The flavor follows suit - tons of hop flavors that just mask any malt backing that could be around. I would prefer to have more caramel malt in the flavor. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good.","clvand0","Mar 01, 2006"
3.83,-9.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a superbly clear deep copper color with a finger of white head that falls quickly to a light coat over top. Good looker. Nose is resinous, with big American citrusy, juicy hops over top a very sweet caramel base. I really like the nose here. Flavor is more malt focused. Good caramel and light toasty base. The hoppy flavors are lighter citrusy and a kiss of earthyness, with a good resinous peppery bitter on the finish that hangs on well after the finish. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty standard, and not setting itself apart. This is a pretty solid brew. No hint of the 7% ABV anywhere. The bittering hop is a touch too strong for me, and I would like to see more flavor hop coming through. Overall, this one is pretty nice.","kmpitz2","Feb 28, 2006"
3.11,-26.3,4.5,3.5,3,2,3,"This baby is hoppy alright, but it's a real floral hop, not really feeling it. My mouth feels like I just took a sip of perfume. the beer seems to be constructed well, just not my style of hop i guess.","ReebShorts","Feb 22, 2006"
4.52,7.1,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Ooured a slightly hazy burnt orange with a thinner but sticky white head that leaves spots of lace as it settled.Fresh raw hop aroma comes at ya hard when first opening the bottle extremely piney with big grapefruit notes as well I even noticed a touch of caramel malt as well.Well oddly enough hop dominated hop oils and resin dominate quite piney but that resiny finish is great just enough of a hint of caramel makes it a gem in my mind.A few years ago I would have thought a good beer but a little over the top for me now I take it all in,gotta love the hops.","oberon","Feb 22, 2006"
4.35,3.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I just had a pint of the Green Flash IPA while in San Diego so I was excited to see it distributed in Southeastern PA. The price was very reasonable at about $35/case. The hops were strong in this IPA but not overwhelming as in some other CA IPA's. The beer had a pine flavor which was tasty. It poured a nice head and was very drinkable. It's ABV is at 7% so it won't (hopefully) get you in trouble with the wifa. A very good IPA & better than most than I have had and I am a hophead. Cheers.","SkinnyElvis","Feb 15, 2006"
4.5,6.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a very good IPA. Obviously Amarillo hops, but not overdone, which some beers with Amarillo hops have. There is a nice malt base, and hop bitterness is there, but not in your face. Highly recommended.","jakester","Feb 09, 2006"
4.25,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I'm glad this beer has made it to my area. A very, west coast style IPA, hence the name. Plenty of big, hoppy flavors to satisfy any hop head. Well balanced and very easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden for a 7% abv IPA. Session some these guys and you'll be tasting them for a while after the fact. An IPA that has found a home in my beer fridge. Definitely worth seeking out.","SwillBilly","Feb 05, 2006"
4.3,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer poured very well into a pint glass, and even as I drink it now with half remaining it still has a very delicate, frothy ring around the glass. It leaves a nice lace as you drink, also. The initial taste is very fruity, then a hop bitterness at the end followed by a smokiness that is more characteristic of a scottish ale. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it!","IPALOVER","Feb 02, 2006"
4.3,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I'm shocked that this beer is only getting a B rating. One of the widely distributed West Coast IPAs that is always consistently awesome. The bad part about this beer is that it went from being served in a 12 ounce six pack to a four pack and costs more now than I ever remember it being. Pours a bright copper color with light khaki cream colored head, forms even speckled lacing evenly coating my chalice. Aroma is great packs in Simcoe, Centennial, and Cascades probably a couple more hops...but it packs the aromatics in with pine, earthy, floral, citrus grapefruit peels, even a touch of pungent marijuana like smell, very green. Rolling aggressive hop bitterness with ample caramel malts to balance out the heavy handed hops. A really nice aggressive West Coast IPA with balancing hop bitterness to dance with. It's a shame that the beer is running around 14 dollars a four pack or I would gravitate this IPA much more often than I can currently afford to. Flavor offers an earthy herbaceous, grapefruit peel ridden hop bitterness/flavor with a lingering hop bitterness that makes you feel like you brushed your teeth with hops. Ample sweetness from the malts makes this more palatable than your average unbalanced hop bomb. Mouthfeel is coated with hop oils and is medium bodied with a flowing carbonation level. Overall very drinkable beer that brings joy to hopheads across the country, although I prefer Port Brewing hoppy offerings to this I can't seem to get any of their beers locally.","WVbeergeek","Feb 01, 2006"
4.72,11.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Lasting white film covers the hazy orange hue. Delicious honeyed malts envelop lively bright citric hops, evolving into leafy and floral territories in mouth. Agressively dry and mineral in mouth, it is fully citric, but not overly bitter. Medium bodied, woody dryness, peppery. Pleasant small-bubbled carbonation. A very aromatic example that I can see people appreciating a lot. A most excellent IPA","chargerfanjess","Jan 26, 2006"
4.43,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"edit: sipping a stone ipa right now which is pure hops. sort of longing for the malt balance that this beer had. world class, imo, and I will certainly get me hands on more of this beer.","pjwilson","Jan 24, 2006"
4.95,17.3,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Notes: I've yet to find an IPA as solid as this from top to bottom. Throw in the fact its priced at $7 bucks a sixpack it then becomes even harder to argue against this brew. THE BEST!","DogFood11","Jan 22, 2006"
4.6,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear copper with a little over a finger of fluffy white head. Fresh citrusy and piney hops. Maybe a little caramel in the background. Bright and crisp hop flavor. Strong, yet not overpowering. Mostly orange and lemon in the hop flavor, but some grass and pine are in there too. Enough malt to stand up to the hops without being really noticable. Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Very refreshing, it'd be easy to knock a couple of these back. Really happy to have this as an option in Phoenix now, I'll definitely be getting this again!","nvsblman","Jan 14, 2006"
3.93,-6.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured a deep copper color with a nice fluffy head leaving a nice lacing. Nose is malty but I am not catching the blast of hops that is to come. Taste initally was a bit more heavy on the caramel malts than usual for this style. But then look out for the blast of hops that finishes the sip! Mouthfeel is very nice for the style, very full and lively. Overall drinkability is good but watch out for the ABV if you are planning on making this a session beer!","arizcards","Dec 23, 2005"

4.05,-4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Very nice in the mouth, the flavor transoms give you a lot to think about but at the same time are blended well enough to enjoy without effort.

3.8,-10,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours a clear full copper color and is topped by a frothy light tan colored head. The aroma starts out with a raw herbal hop note but then moves to softer, sweeter citrus notes of grapefruity and orange peel. The taste has a slight sweetness up front which carries through towards the finish. The malt sweetness accentuates the grapefruit-like citrus hop notes, but there is also a noticeable raw hop note that is a mix of herbal notes and pine. The beer has a solid bitterness to it that slowly builds towards the long astringent, lingeringly bitter finish. This is a nice example of an IPA, perhaps the body is a bit thicker than usual and at this point I might like it a bit thinner, but come another day the body would probably hit the spot just perfectly. Perhaps the finish is a bit too raw and astringent with the heavy handed hops, but it definitely is an enjoyable hop blast of a beer.","Gueuzedude","Oct 29, 2005"

3.87,-8.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"The beer abandons the stubby 12-ounce brown bottle a cloudless deep amber with a behemothic frothy light tan head that slowly fades away leaving a fine coating of lace to encircle the glass. Nose has a nice hop floral spiciness, undergirded by the sweet malt, quite crisp and fresh to the senses, start is sweet with a nice but light grain profile, top a bit light for my liking. Finish is adequately acidic, the hops persistent in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a nice drinkable IPA, that doesn't murder the tastebuds and fits in nicely on this 112 degree day in sunny Arizona.","Gusler","Jul 01, 2005"
4.03,-4.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A good interpretation of the west coast IPA and another good Green Flash brew to add to their lineup. The pour and the apperance of this brew were outstanding with a dark copper color and a very nice fluffy white head that stuck to my glass and stayed till the end. The smell was very hoppy with an earthy quality to it as well, and very citrusy. Most of the malt flavors are burried under the very bitter hoppiness, but I for one like the hop flavor that it has. It is very raw and may not be the most balanced IPA, but it is lots of that great hoppy taste. The lightly sweet maltiness sneaks into the flavor at the start and is noticable in the finnish, but the hops are definantly the star here. Green Flash seemed to get off on a slow start, but with this beer and their latest anniversary ale, they seem to be getting on the right track.","Dmann","May 17, 2005"
