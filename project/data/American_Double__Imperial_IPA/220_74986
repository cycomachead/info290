Not the best offering from Lagunintas currently on the shelf but there was enough to like here without the usual """hop bomb""" characteristics that are found in so many beers of this style. Quirky, subtly strong, and deep, this beer was typical of Lagunitas style and slightly held true to form as there was some brown sugary-sweetness that was underneath everything else here. A fun beer that's worth a go for IPA lovers.","JerzDevl2000","Monday at 01:37 AM"

Going down, everything sticks right there. Then the malt kicks in on the back end to balance everything out perfectly.  Really tasty beer!  Or should I say sucks? Top shelf beer here people.

It should be a year-round beer, as it stacks above much of the other countless examples of this style without going far out of bounds in terms of radical ingredients/ taste. Based on the lengthy, self-deprecating description of this release, they really screwed up (their words much harsher), however I disagree that they did (as I suspect even they do). Solid stuff, and in a 1-quart bottle of under $5.00 cost, a huge plus. IPA devotees, try this.","TBoneJones","Jan 23, 2015"

Piney hop resin left on the lips. The body is medium-heavy yet the nice citrus balance makes it feel a lot lighter. After taste of strong piney hop resin.","GregJ","Jan 11, 2015"

The taste follows suit with the piney, resiny hops even more prevalent along with sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, orange peel, tangerine, and tropical fruit.  The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and really oily, with incredible balance and drinkability.  Overall, this is incredibly bold and flavorful, yet totally balanced and drinkable.

Hops and floral nose, mild bitterness, and a nice balance. Worth the wait here in New England for an annual taste, and solid. Held it's own in a tasting lineup with Stone Enjoy By, Jai Alia, and some killer home brew from Bobhouse brewery. Looking for another bomber or two.","RobbDogg","Dec 06, 2014"

For one thing, brown sugar substitute or not, hints of faux brown sugar are immediately apparent from the first sip. Not too much but it is noticeable. The flavor is a great compliment to the well-blended mix of grains found in this beer. But what really got me was the """holy cow""" moment when I remembered I was drinking an Imperial IPA. My favorite part of this beer is that, as an IPA, it relies on flavors other than hops to set it apart. If you are looking for a super-hoppy pour, this is not your bag. But if you just want a really smooth brew, with very smooth taste, you've found it.","TheRaven","Nov 08, 2014"

Citrus hops dominate the smell and the taste too.  I note grapefruit as well as some pine.  While the hops hit you hard at the start, they give way to a caramel malt flavor and the finish is quite clean.  Overall this is just a great beer that I could sip on daily.","Retroman40","Nov 02, 2014"

Taste is huge tropical fruits, dankness, and citrus. Still no alcohol. One of the smoothest drinking DIPAs out there. This stuff is liquid gold. The blend of malts is perfect and makes this beer incredibly drinkable and balanced. Overall one of the best DIPAs around. I just wish they had it in 6 packs more often.

Immediate nose of pine, lemons, and bitters. Mid-palate seamless shift to barley, malt, and sweetness. On the back palate there is great hop notes: lemongrass, wheat, and toasted barley.

The nose is a combination of fruity tropical hops, piney hops, floral hops, even some lemon. Basically every kind of hop character imaginable.  The flavor has a very present sweet malt base, but a strong hop flavor. Peppery at first, and then it dies into a faint bitterness. Really good. I'm much more impressed with it this time around.  My last one must have been very old.","BenwayPHD","Sep 24, 2014"

Nose in glass I found a wonderful combination of faint caramel and a hopnoxiuos blend of pineapple, orange, mango, and honey. Taste follows the smell. Caramel is here but not in the usual """heavy""" way common to so many IPAs. Instead in lends just a hint of sweetness to the hop medley described above. The tasted pretty fresh to me, but I have a feeling that one I knew was a couple of weeks past bottling would be a completely different animal.","DIM","Sep 23, 2014"

The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, piney, and a nice touch of citrus. The taste is hoppy, with some maltyness, piney, nice citrus note. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Nice to have some nice Lagunitas brews here in UT. One of the best breweries out there for the price.","Wasatch","Sep 20, 2014"

Heads and shoulders above the Hop Stoopid I had last night (although the Hop Stoopid was about 4 months old compared to the 2 month old Sucks). Of the 50-60 IPAs/DIPAs I've had, this is now in my top 5, and if it becomes readily available in my area year-round, I'll be buying at least 2-3 every time I can find it under a couple months old.","randeezy74","Aug 21, 2014"

The color is a nice light-copper with a sizable head that slowly dissipates. The initial aroma is a tepid, piney hop aroma with a strong malt presence and a bit of citrus. When you give the glass a good swirl, it unleashes a strong orange and citrus aroma. The taste is full of juicy citrus and light pine. A modest hop bitterness then hits the palate. The bitterness is followed by a distinct orange rind flavor that sits on the tongue. There is a ton of hop flavor, but modest bitterness: I like it! The carbonation is muted. The beer is medium bodied with a sort of wet, “juicy” mouthfeel, which suits the beer well. Overall, a really good beer and, at $7 for a 32oz bottle, will definitely be a brew I’d buy again. I would love to try a fresher bottle, too!","thomda11","Aug 05, 2014"

4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from bottle into rocks type glass from hotel. Nice thick foamy head that persists and laces well, at least in this odd glass. Appearance is completely transparent straw color with lots of carb coming up from glass. Nose is kinda funky, almost savory in a way. Had this beer a lot but didn't examine nose this thoroughly before. Taste is malt forward and followed by a hop bitterness that has flavors of pepper, some citrus peel, and finally some booziness at the end, which i actually like. Mouthfeel is where it should be. Overall an outstanding beer that is a go to whenever available.","slackattack","Jun 26, 2014"

It does have a distinct sweetness, like brown sugar, or molasses, but it is not refined. It tastes a lot like a cheap beer with no hops.","JulioH","Jun 20, 2014"

Smell is of pine and tropical fruit, citrus, lots of grapefruit and orange, juicy mango with a bit of lightly sweet malt as well. Taste is dry and hoppy, tons of citrus and dank pine flavours, grapefruit and mango, bit of orange in the aftertaste, oily hops and some lightly sweet malt. Slick and oily mouthfeel, lightly carbonated, medium-full body. Amazing stuff, truly one of the great beers of the style, something I would love to drink on a regular basis.","peensteen","Jun 16, 2014"

It's a tad to dry and hoppy for my taste. Beautiful citrus ale color, lots of bubbles, a nice thin typical ale head. Very refreshing taste and smell. The smell really previews the hop taste that is to come. Taste is very dry and hop flavored. Lightly sweet and citrusy though. Pretty easy drinking, if you enjoy a dry hoppy brew this is probably going to be up your alley. It's a little to hop for my likings. Very high abv, so considering that it's very drinkable. Very refreshing, would highly recommend this.","MIchelle","Apr 15, 2014"

A big fresh peach smell is the first thing I get, with an awesome blend of orange, grapefruit, floral hops, pine needle, and sweet bread malts. Really a great smelling beer. In the mouth, it starts out like a classic IPA with grapefruit and lemon zest flavors, then it really becomes a beast of its own with sweeter fruit flavors like pineapple and peach. Toward the end I pick up a lot of mouth-coating hop oil and pine needle. It's not as bitter as it sounds though. The bitterness is muted by a strong, sweet bread malt presence from the beginning of the tongue until the end. Medium body with good carbonation.

One of the more acclaimed and storied DIPAs on this website and more generally, this is the sort of thing a guy like me will go ballistic over, buying a case or two to share and overindulge in during a shitty work week. Quite a light color truth be told, a golden sunset orange with a reasonably prominent beige head. Who cares what it looks like, really. Smells like a tangerine dream, massive dank grapefruit, mandarin and lime on the nose along with tropical starfruit or perhaps guava, melon, and a grainy spice note that I attribute to the hybrid grain bill. A taste reveals a brew positively bursting at the seams with citrus juices and aromatic oils, goes from lime to navel orange to grapefruit to sweet pine needles in a rapid assault and then stabilizes somewhat into a heady mixture of sugery nutty malts, papaya spears, pineapple, muskmelon, orange Creamsickle, blackberry, and faint garlic. Amazingly smooth and drinkable despite the assertive fresh flavors, not a palate wrecker and lacking obnoxious protruding off-flavors like really strong pine resin (sometimes I crave such flavors but here they would wreck the mood). It does make the mouth tingle, almost like Sichaun pepper. I do get a little floral flavor but by and large this is a fruit bowl. Moderately thick body and finishes wet, with the citrus and tropical fruit flavors staying until the woody bitter end. Notably though, the bitterness is not coarse and I could (and have!) consume this in quantity because of the dangerously smooth mouthfeel. You can taste alcohol but not to the brew's detriment. Carbonation manages to stay out of the way. Wow. Believe the hype. A cornucopia of hop flavors and perhaps edges out Green Flash as my current favorite IPA ... I'd have to check the ratings. Right now its all about the moment.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 01, 2014"

It's good, don't get me wrong, but there are much better DIPAs out there.","xabyss","Mar 23, 2014"

Its almost more malty than hoppy, but whatever it is, it just makes for effortless enjoyment. Really enjoyed this!","hoagzzz","Mar 20, 2014"

Nothing could be further from the truth, so I have no idea what the name is about. With that out of the way, this is a competent but unremarkable west coast IPA--big bitterness without much else to distract. If I liked IPAs, I might be a fan, but to me this is just another one-dimensional hop bomb. The fact that the label betrayed me doesn't help...","MaximalC","Mar 19, 2014"

The smell was highly potent out of the glass at an arm's length. Very citric hops with a touch of pear, and the intensity is great. I could just smell this beer for a while. The taste another hop assault, as the grapefruit, tangerine, and bitter orange flavors just hit all at once. The malt is not much of a presence here except providing some sticky sweetness. Medium dense and creamy feeling in the mouth. This was a very well crafted DIPA. There is of course no substitute for Brown Shugga, but I hope they keep this one around too. Otherwise they would really suck :)","rajendra82","Mar 08, 2014"

The aromas will about knock you out, very floral with pine and plenty of hops as well as some honey. Taste is amazing nice sweet honey upfront followed but a bit of pine with hops galore. Great bitterness that is not overpower but lingers nicely. Good body without feeling filling or heavy. This is really a nice beer that won't let you down.","EricTKole","Mar 08, 2014"

Supremely disappointed to discover (too late) that no sixpacks are being made.  I finally broke down and bought one of the new quart bottles for $7 (had held off because they were $8-10 around here and it was just a turn off to have to pay almost double per ounce compared to last year) despite the fact that it had no readable bottling date on it, and sure enough it was OK but had no particular hop flavor.  Perhaps I'll find a fresh dated bottle or two this year, in the mreantime hoping the sixpacks come back next Jan, albeit certainly at a big price jump (I'll guess $13-15/6 at least from previously $10-11/6.)","scotorum","Mar 07, 2014"

Color was a deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity and since Croesus, Midas and Mammon were already here, they decided to hang around a bit longer. The nose was nothing less than resinous and it seemed to be leaking pine tar. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops went right to work, coating my tongue with sticky pine goodness. This doesn't suck at all! They lied to me. My hops fix was finally starting to take 'hold, but I wonder what my upper limit is. The label marks it as 63.21 IBUs and I could sense every one of them. My eyes actually began to water a little bit. Finish was dry, but not to the point that I needed oxygen afterwards.

Completely white top with a small amount active carbonation rising to the top. Grapefuit smell. Devoid of the pine smell that accompanies some hoppy beers. Really bitter pale ale from the initial taste, finishes with a long after taste on the tounge where pineyness appears. Devoid of sweetness. Flavor lingers for too long IMO. I am not a huge fan of this. Can slightly tell the abv is above 5 at 7.85 while the IBU is 63. I'm really not a fan of the taste or shall I say after taste on this one.","Ryanm1","Feb 13, 2014"

From the very beginning the aroma is very inviting and greatly shows the hops used, but I wasn't too much of a fan of the dryness to this beer. I seem to enjoy IPAs with much more body and a malt backbone to them, and although I see why this beer is thoroughly enjoyed and sought after, I would have enjoyed it more if there was more complex malty flavor that didn't leave such a dry finish.","Steve_Dave","Feb 05, 2014"

I did not go into this one with high hopes. I have not really had a good experience with the other beers I have had from this brewery, maybe I just like East coast breweries, or at least from the Rockies eastward. Anyway, I was actually really impressed with this one. The color and everything was lighter than I had expected it to be. The smell was sweet candy, with some hops present. The taste was where it was at. This beer was very well balanced. A great mixture of hops and sweetness. I have been on a lighter beer trend lately and for some reason I expected this one to be more on the darker side. I was overly surprised with this one and I will have to say they did make a beer that I enjoyed. I will try this one again next year and I hope it remains consistent. I have heard it may become more of a year round thing. Which might lighten its luster a bit, but over all I would try this one from time to time, if I caught it on sale like I did this time.","humuloner22","Feb 04, 2014"

Sultry even. It has a tropical fruit sweetness and bit of mango. Soft suggestion of pine but nothing sharp. Fresh ripe orange and a bit of sugar for a malt presence on the nose. Some orange peel to really sweeten it and brighten it. Taste is a light delicious juicy mouthful of liquid fruit. Fresh orange with tropical underpinnings. Gentle pine. The malt is supple and graceful and like a bit of sugar. It drinks with a bit of hop oil on the body of the beer, medium mouthfeel and has a touch of sticky resin to coat the mouth and leave a softly moderate bitter. Dries the palate and finishes with a faint spice and a bit more bitter with a pleasant aftertaste like fresh orange juice. There is no alcohol on this beer save for a touch of warmth. Drinks so easily and has an amazing lightness .","utopiajane","Feb 02, 2014"

Lacing close to perfect, rippling down the glass sides, like beach sand after a blow. Aroma does have the sweet fruit smell, not quite to pineapple, but close. Steady carbonation feeding that Carmel head. Mouth feel is fresh and invigorating. Taste, ya grapefruit , high on the bitters. I keep swishing the brew over the tongue, cheek to cheek , trying to find the floral oils, of orange, tangerine, crushed fruit bowl... Not there... Looking for the mystery, the hidden flavor which puzzles the taste buds... Not there... Good beer, pouring number 2, but hoping for a whole lot more. Far from SUCKS, quite good and very drinkable.

I always forget Sucks is a DIPA. It tastes like a robust IPA. If the brew had a more creamy feel at the outset with longer lasting carbonation, and if the color of body were more distinct and uniformed, (not a toss-up of yellow/orange/gold) it would get a perfect score all across the board.

A pronounced fluffy white head gives way to myriad lace patterns resembling constellations and snowflakes. Quite impressive. The nose on this one is without rival. I've smelled some really good IPAs in my day, many of which I've yet to review, but this one takes the cake. Brown sugar, grapefruit, pineapple, and tobacco leaf invade the senses and demand that you come back for more. As remarkable as it smells, it tastes just as good. Distinctively hoppy, yet equally balanced by a generous amount of citrus flavors. Despite the Imperial billing, the abv is barely detectable. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth like a nice pair of legs. Lagunitas turned what could have been an accident into, what is in my opinion, the best beer in their inventory. Like Kate Upton emerging from a pool in a curve hugging bikini, this beer arouses me in ways that are beyond words. Sucking never tasted so good.","weiserr","Jan 29, 2014"

The head dissipates aver a few minutes, leaving generous gobs of lacing clinging to the glass. The arom is of resinous pine sap, freshly cut grass, some straw, and lemon and grapefruit citruses. It tastes of resinous pine, the aforementioned citrus, some grass/herbs, and some special combination of hop spices and holiday spices that I can’t seem to put my finger on. Hint of nutmeg or clove? Either way, it works well. The mouthfeel is as expected; bitter up front, lively and carbonated in the middle, and dry on the finish with the resinous nature of the hops lingering. Overall, this is a good IPA that incorporates a great hop profile with “a little something extra.” Well balanced, yet still interesting, flavorful, and exciting.","eclipse54","Jan 27, 2014"

4.34,0,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured this out of a 12oz. bottle into my Maudite snifter. Gave it a nice aggressive pour that produced a solid 1” thick head that lasted for a few minutes. The lacing the beer left behind was lovely, almost as if you could see every sip you took like the rings of a tree on the edge of the glass. The smell of the beer is pretty good with a nice dank resiny sent, I do have a slightly stuffy nose myself right now so my sense is a little off. The beer is truly a delight on the palate, with a wonderful sweetness reminiscent of a dank mango fruitiness that leaves a lasting impression on the tongue well after you’ve swallowed this treat of a beverage. Now I’m a huge fan of Lagunitas and this beer has that sweetness flavor to it that you’ll find in any hop forward offering from Lagunitas. So just another great beverage from a great a great brewery.","Boomblaze","Jan 26, 2014"

Healthy amount of just off-white head that held pretty well, and faded into a medium-thin collar and a thin head that held until the glass emptied. Lacing is spotty, but pretty good. Aroma is a really interesting dance between pine and citrus hops with a nice supporting cast of a medium malt base. Though, the more I sniff, the more I pick up on the citrus over the pine. Taste is surprisingly malt centered. I get some tropical hops character in the front, that moves into more of the grapefruit, then some pine, then back to citrus; all being held up by this really great malt sweetness. Carbonation is a bit high for an IPA, but I'm kinda digging that. Body is medium to full.","mverity","Jan 26, 2014"

It has a lighter mouthfeel than most DIPAs I've had, but the hops pack quite a punch as your taste buds become overwhelmed by a grapefruity bitterness, in a good way (it's smooth, not harsh).

Typical Stone aroma of just heavyhanded hops, mostly citric although some grape and even possible tropical get in there (there seems to be some light, airy fruity sweetness poking around). Taste is basically the same with lots of piney, earthiness, citric, some grape and again this tropical fruit sensation (at this point I'd say pineapple, mango, apricot - just a sweeter fruit). Great balance as the small amount of bready malt and possible caramel malt help keep the beer from being too hoppy and it finishes so crisp and clean.

Remove some of the hops that delightfully highlight the beer, and focus on the underlying tones that supplement those fresh hops. When I tried heady topper with a year of age, it honestly tasted so much better without the distraction of the intense bitterness on a 2 day-old batch.

The malt backbone is there but it definitely takes a back seat to the hops, which is what I prefer in IPAs. Given the availability and price this is hard to beat. Sure, Heady is probably better, but this is on the shelves all over the country, and it certainly trumps anything else with that sort of distribution. I have gone through 3 6-packs in the last few weeks alone; highly recommended.","mrkdwrds","Jan 16, 2014"

Crystal clear with just the slightest sediment. No haze and more Pliny than heady. The aroma was one of the best I've smelled. Pineapple orange citrus with a piney balance that had my nose buried. I crave this beers smell. The taste hit all the citrus and pine. Very good only slightly less refined than say Pliny but better than average no doubt. The bitterness was good not overpowering but late on the palette it was more noticed than others. This beer overall is one of my favorites and was very good.

It may be a touch sweeter too, which helps emphasize the fruit flavor.  I'm digging the quart bottle for sure!  Flashback to a time when it was common to buy beer (70's) in quarts.

I don't have a preference either way; what I can say is that it Lagunitas has executed this kind of Imperial IPA quite well. The only thing that needs to improve is the carbonation level. That's not a huge issue, but it does rob the beer of some of its potential. Still, a very, very tasty beer. Recommended for all those hop heads out there!","hagbergl","Jan 13, 2014"

Nose is filled with pungent freshly picked grapefruit like hop aroma. I get just a whiff of that cereal grain mixture. The mouth seems weighted,dry,and sticky from the hops. I would describe the taste as a great blend of bitter citrus hops mixed with sweet and slightly nutty cereal grains. Like honey but Cheerios meets west coast IPA.","Franziskaner","Jan 10, 2014"

A bit sweet, which slightly turns me off. Tons of sticky hop funk in the flavor throughout. More citrus than in the nose. Mouthfeel is sticky, but the carbonation helps to scrape it off the tongue.

As much as I like Lagunitas, I think many of their beers have a house style that makes them taste too similar to one another. Not this one. It's a breath of fresh air, with a flat out stank to it and lovely citrusy aromas and flavors- lime and tangerine with some herbs and some light fresh malt flavors that serve as a pedestal for the hops. Fresh tasting and not heavy on the palate, but with a satisfying finish with a touch of honeyed sweetness that complements the hops. A lovely beer.","Georgiabeer","Jan 03, 2014"

Overall this beer is a brilliant citrus IPA that packs a silent punch with the ABV. My favorite Lagunitas IPA.","mc4z","Dec 27, 2013"

The hops are pretty intense but there is no bitterness until the aftertaste. Lagunitas Sucks is a superior DIPA and it pretty much lives up to the hype (although I still think that their Day Time IPA is slightly better and generally their crowning achievement).","walkinginplace","Dec 27, 2013"

Off the bat there is significantly more cat pee, pine, lemon peel, and huge florals than last time. Flavor is a mouthfeel of fresh hops, medium bitter, with honey, pine, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, and some sweet malts in the background. What a night and day difference! Medium slick mouthfeel with medium or a little less carbonation. A really nice brew that I could have again for sure. Maybe a step or two below my favorites but still very nice. Only complaint is that I would like a bit more carb. Glad I retried this one. Deleted the other rating because I think it might have been a really old bottle. Shit happens.

4.32,-0.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Poured into a pint glass: a light amber with thick white head that fades into fine lacing and a thin top layer. Wonderful hop citric aroma and flavor that is characteristic of Lagunitas brews followed by a slightly syrupy and numbing (from the hops) mouth-feel that compels one to drink more and more. The hops, of course, are the focus, but they are supported and wonderfully balanced by a medium/light malt/sweet backbone that makes the drinkability excellent. It is light, crisp, and perfectly hoppy. In my opinion, far better than brown sugga.","Eisen","Dec 12, 2013"

Sucks accomplishes both with it's powerful hop aroma and flavor, straying quite far from the usual winter warmers released around the same time. This tropical, citrusy double IPA is a look forwards to spring and summer as it finishes crisp, clean, and damn drinkable - it's a quenching double IPA, not a barleywine-like monster. I don't think anyone will blame Lagunitas for sucking unless they stop making this delicious beer.","BeerFMAndy","Dec 09, 2013"

This is what I have come to expect from Lagunitas. As the Holiday Ale warmed I could taste a nice malty backbone that helped balance out the strong hops. The beer leaves a good lingering bitterness on the palate and the flavor kept me coming back. This was another great beer from Lagunitas.","brurevu","Nov 18, 2013"

Smells like I was awoken from a stupor in a British Columbia marijuana farm. Dank hops explosion. Holy crap. Mild notes of pale malt, wheat, oatmeal, jackfruit melon, and candied orange peel come through. Insane dry hop character. Taste is not too sticky, fresh, well balanced, mild alcohol spice. Palate is very soft and silky and small saltwater quenching. Mild piney hop character. I can’t believe it- Lagunitas best beer by a mile. Makes Hop Stoopid look a little stoopid. Why this is called a """holiday ale""" is beyond me but this is on another level from Brown Shugga. Actually on another level from Lagunitas. How did this happen? I would seriously consider this beer as a DIPA of choice over Pliny the Elder. This is a DIPA masterpiece. 9/4/8/4/17=4.2","tarheels86","Jul 18, 2013"

Smell is hoppy with mostly citrus hops, but also some floral. Good amount of malt in the background as well, pale, caramel and a hint of spicy rye. Taste follows with mostly hops, citrus, floral some pine. Maltiness is here too, with the rye playing a slightly more pronounced role. Nice complexity. Mouthfeel is bitter with a bit of spiciness, not the beer's strong point. Overall a great beer, but I've had better, not as excited as some of the reviewers.","IllNate","May 04, 2013"

It has a killer hop scent surrounded by a solid pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a wonderful hop flavor; bold and full of citrus notes. The malt bill provides adequate balance and a smooth pale and Munich malt flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious DIPA. It's true to the West coast style and highly drinkable.","WesWes","Apr 15, 2013"

It tastes awesome--dominated by pine, but with a solid malt backbone and a real brightness from grapefruit, mango, citrus. Finishes somewhat bitter but clean.

I also find it far lighter than a lot of DIPAs and certainly light for the ABV. Better than any east coast IPA i've tried. I can't stop drinking it. Very very good.

The initial taste was quite pleasing, replete with piney, lemon/orangetastes and plenty of well balanced piney and citrusy hops. The first three seconds on the pallet is great, packing great amounts of flavor into a well balanced sweet, resinous, and citrusy punch. The only issue I had with the brew was in the aftertaste- slightly more sweet than I like in my IPAs- maybe amplified by the yeast? Overall mouthfeel was good, fairly crisp and carbonation is there while it finished nicely. Certainly could taste the booze towards the end of the bottle- but I was skiing so WTF it made for a great few runs off of paradise. Overall a well balanced IPA that exemplifies piney resin but a bit too sweet.","80x2HopHead","Mar 24, 2013"

Clear golden yellow with visible carbonation, thick foamy white head that came up a lot more than I expected, even with a pretty tame pour. Leaves bubbly lacing all over the glass as it's drunk. Smell is sweet fruit at first, sort of mango or pineapple, then hoppy at the end. Almost smells gin-like. Taste follows suit exactly; sweet and smooth up front, then hoppy and bitter at the end. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, odd for the style, but probably from the extra sweetness. Overall, this is quite different from your average DIPA, but it's delicious.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Mar 09, 2013"

Favorite part about this brew is the smell, and it's pretty much everything I could want out of the aroma from an IPA. Bold hop flavor, clean citrus, and some fragrant florals. Absolutely great smell. Looks very similar to their other IPAs, a bright golden, perfectly transparent, but with some very small suspended bubbles. Taste is all about hops and citrus. You will feel like you just enjoyed a fresh, tart and perfectly sweet grapefruit after you take a sip. Overall, more well balanced then Hop Stoopid, exceptionally smooth and drinkable.","Samuel906","Feb 27, 2013"

Tastes are sweet and tropical; similar to aroma with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, honey, biscuity malt finds its way in there, a tad boozy, finishes sweet, but bitter and dry.

Citrus and tropical hops dominate the flavor as well, but there is tons of pale malt sweetness. The bitterness is surprisingly light probably partially due to the sweetness. Overall the hop flavor is hard to beat, and the sweetness and lack of bitterness make it extremely drinkable.","ericj551","Feb 18, 2013"

Overall a very good ale, I actually prefer this to Brown Shugga, a little less dry than some west coast Imperial Ipa's, however it is very fresh and has a full hop taste from beginning to end with emphasis on hop flavor rather than just bitterness which I like compared to others of its ilk.","Slatetank","Feb 17, 2013"

Palate has some good flavors of citrus with malt to balance it out, pine too, but oh my goodness the booze is just over the top. With the booziness I would have sworn it is a 10% beer but it's not, as it's barely higher than a normal IPA in the 7% range. So this is a major flaw because so many really good examples and great examples do so much better at integrating flavors that yields a non-boozy result. Just not all that enjoyable to drink this one, though it is great to look at and smell. But I can't get over that with every sip I feel like I'm downing some alcohol bomb... but it's actually not very strong.","yemenmocha","Feb 08, 2013"

4.29,-1.2,4.5,4.75,4,3.75,4.5,"D/O: This big IPA is the hedonist's choice for the style--it presents abundant hops and abundant malt sugar that are surprisingly successful at balancing each other. As a DIPA it is more believable, but here it wins because it retains easily observed defining characteristics that the bigger DIPAs simply lose control over. Flavors may step over a line of appropriateness--if this is a regular IPA--but seem tight and much more modern compared to most DIPAs. Pliny it is not--that beer is an exercise in restraint while this is a projection of excess on a budget. Exact style aside, this beer succeeds resoundingly at delivering some of the most desirable hops qualities available without the burden of a 10% abv investment.","beagle75","Feb 08, 2013"

3.72,-14.3,4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"The beer pours a lovely oranged yellow, almost golden, with a great big slightly cream white head that sits at over two finger widths. The body is light and translucent, with only the faintest mist of haze, and a steady stream of gentle carbonation bubbles working to the top of the glass. The beer’s lacing is droopy and thin, leaving a spatterwork of hanging sheets upon the sides of the glass. On the nose the beer smells big with minty pine, a touch of citrus, and a faint touch of salty onion. The grains are found only as the lightest backdrop for the smell, suggesting slight toasty bread and caramel. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with a nice light sweet tinge. The beer begins with sweet bitters before opening into slightly caramelly herbal bitters that lightly suggest mint and onion. The finish runs with a light touch of orange citrus and is strong with pine, which lasts into the finish. The aftertaste is light with medicinal bitters and piney hops. On the mouth, the beer feels medium-light in body, with just the faintest gelling to suggest a heavier beer. The carbonation leaves a decent prickle on the tongue, and after the beer leaves the mouth is left sticky-dry, with a bitter astringency gripping at the tongue, though the mouth is clean. Overall, I’m a little disappointed with Sucks… Lots of people are heralding this beer as an amazing DIPA, but honestly I see it more as a strong IPA, falling just short of the bigger flavors that a DIPA carries. The beer is nicely drinkable, and carries some nice bitters, but the onioniness that this beer has is throwing me off the taste, and other than that I fine the hop profile a little lackluster in terms of complexity. Just to clarify, I have tried a six-pack of these now, and all of them have had the slight onion flavor, which is odd and I suppose I will chalk up to an older pack (though they had spent less than a week on the shelf when I picked them up…). This beer is a mediocre almost-DIPA, in my book, but is not really worthy of hunting down.","Maxwell","Feb 05, 2013"

The first time I had this year's batch I was surprised at how malty it was, given how everyone kept calling it a DIPA. That, combined with the fact that I picked up on less hops than I do now, made me think of this as more of a strong ale, so it took away points for the lack of sticking to the style. However, I keep drinking it and now I can't stop. I dont care if I get a heavy malty stickyness from that cereal medley of malt, it tastes really good. Call it what you will, but I'm in favor of a beer that just tastes great, even if it doesn't fit squarely into one style. For $9/6 pack, I can't imagine I will drink much else while this is available.","MCain04","Feb 05, 2013"

4.49,3.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste focuses more on hop flavor than bitterness, which is nice on this beer. Lots of pine and tropical hop flavors with a crushed grain maltiness that is a little heavier than 'biscuit'...maybe 'hint-o-caramel' works better. The components are supremely well integrated, it is so smooth and...well...delicious. While this tastes similar to many of Lagunitas' other offerings, it almost seems like they have perfected it here. At 7.85%, I would argue this fits better in the regular IPA category than DIPA but they seem to have failed to axe my opinion. I might go so far as to say this is Petaluma's best beer, it really is delicious.","twiggamortis420","Feb 01, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, and earthy hops. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, pine, floral, honey, grass, and herbal hop earthiness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zests, citrus rind, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, honey, and herbal hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop complexity, with a nice malt balance supporting the big hops; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

Light green onion and garlic grow confidently under a shady pine tree while sipping on a hint of vodka. Light bready malt peaks through but barely musters the courage to stick around. The flavor is light cracker and bready malts with an onslaught of onion garlic and pine. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel.

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Had while hanging out at Potent Potables with beermeX2! Served from tap into Lagunitas mason jar style glass (proper!). Poured golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, onion, onion hop, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, onion hop, onion, earth, citrus, and grass. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was surprised at how easy this one was to drink and how refreshing it was. You would never imagine that this brew was almost 8% ABV by the aroma or flavor. I could definitely see myself drinking a ton of this before it was too late with no problem at all. A really well done brew that I would love to have time and time again.","thagr81us","Jan 27, 2013"

It wraps up with malt and a touch of eucaliptus oil. Very pleasant to drink with a nice hop bitterness playing counterpoint to the light malt sweetness.

In the aroma, one gets a big hit of pine with a measure of citrus in the background. The aroma is actually quite potent. In the initial taste, one gets pine, lime rind, and grapefruit. Sour tickles the sides of the tongue with a candy sweetness goes down the center. The sourness is what lingers most into the aftertaste. This does not dismiss the warming sensation that follows the beer down to the beer belly. The texture is appropriate for the style and little carbonate is evident. The thickness allows the sour to linger nicely on the tongue. Lagunitas makes quality accessible beers for a cheap price. With Lagunitas Sucks, they hit it out of the park.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 25, 2013"

The head settles a little bit but leaves a really nice sticky lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is ripe with citrus notes and some addition pine in there. It smells like a DIPA for sure, and a good one at that! The taste of the beer is hoppy with the citrusy pine notes with some subtle caramel malts in the finish. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and has an oily feel to it while remaining lighter bodied.

5,15.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall: A perfect DIPA. I can't get over how crisp and clean the hop flavors and aromas are in this beer. Honestly, this beer has some of the most clean, and complex hop flavors and aromas I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Lagunitas really does create magic with hops, and how well they balance out strong hop profiles with sweet, complez malt flavors as well. If you love hops, you'll love this. I can find nothing wrong with this beer, at all.","HeresToHopping","Jan 21, 2013"

4.27,-1.6,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"The palate opens with a blend of the fruity hops and some of the malt sweetness. The fruity flavors are a riot, they are super-fresh, juicy, vibrant and refreshing. Mandarins, peach, mango and melon are exuberantly expressed here, making the hop bitterness relatively insignificant. The sweetness is medium-low, mostly with flavors of honey and a kind of cracker-like malt character. While the sweetness is a little higher than I'd typically care for, it does work here. The mouthfeel is rather excellent too. Hoppy without being too resiny (not that that's ever been a problem for me), a water profile that really works with the flavor profile (not too chalky/mineral-y), and with a moderate carbonation level (a little too high IMO), this is very enjoyable. The finish is pleasantly bitter and resiny, but is also very fruity. Excellent stuff.","DefenCorps","Jan 20, 2013"

The flavor is balanced toward very fruity, slightly piney hop flavor but malty sweetness and some hints of ABV emerge after the burst of hops. Bitterness is smooth and appropriately high.

Aroma of piney, herbal, lightly floral hops, grapefruit and apple. Nice. Flavor combines piney and citrus hops with an excellent bready malt body with notes of grapefruit, lemon, citrus rind and light fruit. Very nice. Even if this had sucked, you would have to admire a brewery that responded to massive disappointment and anguish for the lack of a beloved beer with a tongue in cheek spoof offering that ended up even more popular than the original.

The bouquet might be the best of any beer I've ever had. Fresh grapefruit right up front with some underlying cannabis. Just a wonderful aroma. Mouthfeel is full, wet, and a bit oily. Carbonation bites just a bit on the finish. The flavor is magnificent. Grapefruit! A lot more pine in the flavor than appeared in the bouquet. Just enough rye in this beer to set all the flavors and aromas off in a more vibrant fashion. A remarkably well-engineered brew.","DocJitsu","Jan 19, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, had tons of great flavors that held my attention, and the low amount of bitterness really helped the drinkability, I could drink quite a few of these when in the mood, fruity hops with out too much alcohol and too much bitterness, yes please! What I like the most about this beer was how awesome the fruity hop profile in this beer was, I don't think I have ever picked up peaches from hops before, I also really liked the appearance, it was really good looking. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I will be going back to the store to get at least a six pack, I will be looking forward to the yearly release of this beer and I highly recommend this beer to just about anyone, even if you aren't crazy about hops, you should still give this beer a try. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, it's everything that I hoped it would be and just a little more, it had one of the best hop profiles that I have encountered in a long time. Lagunitas did a kick ass job with this beer and I'm glad I finally got a chance to try it, this is one of the better beers that i have had from them, maybe the best, I was already a fan of Lagunita's but this beer puts them close to being my favorite out of state brewery, great job guys, I can't get enough of this stuff.","StoutHunter","Jan 16, 2013"

Tons of hop character in the nose, predominately citrus tones with some tropical fruits. Taste is what a hop bomb should always be, tons of hop flavor and bitterness but not overdone. Citrusy hops are front and center again with a buttery malt sweetness holding it all together. Mouthfeel is about what you would expect for the style and the alcohol is well hidden.

I would definitely put this beer next to my other all time favorite single IPAs (Sculpin and Blind Pig). If you see this, buy it immediately. Truly is an amazing beer.

The first thing I notice is the appearance of this beer, its a beautiful pale orange with a half inch cap that is off white. The nose is great, everything I look for in a well made DIPA, dank, sweet, floral, and fruity. The flavor profile is mango, oranges and molasses with a bitter beam of hops to balance the brew out, very well done, the beer gives up more complexity as it warms in my tulip. The mouth is fine, not to oily and not to dry, the finish though dissipates rather quickly. Overall I think this is a very well made beer from a very well respected producer that I will gladly seek out again.","OTB","Dec 31, 2012"

The taste followed suit, but the bitterness of the hops tended to drown out the other flavors. Finally, if we must gripe, the coloring was a little light for our preference, but this was made up for greatly by the beautiful carbonation and head, and the following retention. This all lead to a fantastic fell and slurp, making this beer great from every angle.","TheBrewo","Apr 20, 2012"

Most IPAs (the stronger American sort I favor) normally seem to run much more toward the coppery end of the spectrum, so I was surprised upon decanting. The smell is similar to the stand-by Lagunitas IPA, with a hint of something...different. One taste revels that difference in its full glory. While a very similar hop profile to Lagunitas IPA, this brew has a wonderful clear hoppiness and strong, lingering tones of tropical fruits, notably pineapple. More rich citrus flavor than the IPA as well. Vaguely tacky to the palate, yet still fairly drinkable, which is well-motivated by the delicious flavors. This could be my favorite offering yet from Lagunitas.","fezmeister","Feb 06, 2012"

Great nose on this beer - candied citrus fruit (grapefruit), herbal/piny hops, a slight onion and pepper character. Upfront flavors are predominantly piny resin and citrus rind. Middle is light, toasted malts and finish re-asserts the faint onion character in the nose with a light, lingering earthy bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an assertive carbonation that leaves a residual prickle across the tongue. There's also a light oiliness and a little bit of acidity.

Grapefruit and pineapple sugary sweetness from the start and throughout over a light caramel malt body and a mild resin bitter finish. Fairly simple, a little sweet, a little boozy and medium bodied. Ok, so I don't get the love for this other than the price. It tastes like any other Lagunitas IPA, which I typically don't enjoy. Happy to drink this fresh, but I'm pretty sure my pint at Friscos cost more than a 6 pack of it does (so maybe that's why I'm...wait for it...bitter).","yourefragile","Dec 28, 2011"

The malts, unlike in most DIPAs, provide a distinct, dry bready undertone to amp up the complexity. I gotta say, I really prefer this to BrownShugga'. Grab this up if you can find any more.

Pours a golden yellow color with a nice white head and decent lacing. Nose is nice and hoppy. Tastes like crisp fruit with lots of floral and citrus hops. This is how I like my ipas. NO MALT ALLOWED and the booze only sneaks through a tad. No sweetness at all here. A nice crisp fruit hop head dream here. Very well done. Hope they brew this again.","DNICE555","Dec 20, 2011"

Barely which is true to the DIPA style in a way. It works because the hop flavor is pushed to the front just above the 63.21 IBUs. I would think any higher and this beer would start to lose it.

A citrus twinge lingers on the palate, and gives way to a sweeter taste of melon and mango, making you almost forget about the unctuous funk quality. Light-medium in the mouthfeel department, and fairly drinkable, but not something I'd revisit.

The aroma is great! Mango, grapefruit, lemon zest and orange rind. The taste is very hoppy, lemony and piney with a big bitterness on the back end. Slightly spicy on the swallow with a touch of more bitters on the aftertaste. Salivation a plenty. Mucho carbonation. Overall I enjoyed the session but it was a little too much for my buds.

The nose of this beer was amazing - grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple and pine. The taste is just about as good. It hits hard at first with the hop and citrus you would expect, follows with some biscuity malt and ends with a pleasant dry bitterness. Wow. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated.

I am not saying the typical """hop bombs""" suck, but it is good to get one that has some balance in the finish.

I can imagine myself licking a tigerlilly, partially because the hops are so thick and pervasive. Clean and smooth though, surprisingly easy drinking. Definitely doesn't come across as a 'heavy' DIPA.

Has a perfect hoppy taste that's not too overbearing but just right. It reminds me of a 90 minute, but smoother. It goes down very smooth. I brought it to my brother-in-law's house last weekend. He drinks one of two things, whiskey or cheap beer. The only time he tries anything good is if I'm around. He couldn't get enough of the stuff.

Smell is really nice- hops, wood, floral notes, maybe some pepper. Really hoppy, well balanced, really nice nose. Not overbearing at all. Taste is good as well- hops in abundance, w/ some malt in the background. Some floral, pepper, and spice in there as well. But let's not kid ourselves... the hops are in charge here. After half a bottle, they've had their way with me.... in a good way. None of the 7.85% alcohol is evident at all- very well hidden. Feel is medium, with nice carbonation. Killer hops bite on the aftertaste. The hops coat your throat like a throat lozenge. Overall, this beer really surprised me. I really enjoyed it. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Dec 02, 2011"

Maybe I haven't had a really fresh, quality IPA - which is clearly what this is - in a while, but this really hit the spot. In retrospect this is approaching hopbomb territory...it won't seem balanced if you don't like big, hoppy IPA's as a rule, but if you do, there's a nice undertone of sweetness and faint spiciness that offsets the IBU's just a smidge.","tobelerone","Dec 01, 2011"

It reminds me a lot of Hop Stoopid, but it's lighter than that, it actually reminds me a bit of Kill Ugly Radio. The malt bill is different, but the hop profile tastes similar to it, and that was my favorite Lagunitas beer.

It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange rind, light lemon zest, pine resin, light leek, white grapefruit rind, and a nice undercurrent of rich caramel. The taste seems to simplify things a bit, focusing on the pine, grapefruit, and caramel. Yeah, it energizes all three, as well. Some mild balsa notes linger in the finish.

Lagunitas has crafted IMHO a classic no-coast IPA. It doesn't have that dank bitter pop of the West and its not too sweet to be East.

Aroma is nice and hoppy, it smells mostly like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's full of pine and citrusy hops, and some sweet malt is noticeable too. There's a bit of sweetness in this brew, but it's still mostly hoppy and has a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and sticky with good carbonation.
