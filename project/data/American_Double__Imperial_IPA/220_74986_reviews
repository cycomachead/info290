"O: I really like this one and will definitely have it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really thought I was going to like this, but I felt the brown sugary sweetness didn't complement the other flavors and left an unpleasant lingering flavor in my mouth."
""
""
""
""
"While the alcohol was strong, I only felt it and could never taste it. Not the best offering from Lagunintas currently on the shelf but there was enough to like here without the usual """hop bomb""" characteristics that are found in so many beers of this style. Quirky, subtly strong, and deep, this beer was typical of Lagunitas style and slightly held true to form as there was some brown sugary-sweetness that was underneath everything else here. A fun beer that's worth a go for IPA lovers."
""
""

"Really good beer and firmly in the new school which emphasises aromatics over bitterness. Cheers Wyatt."
"Looks like more of a light yellowy haze for a DIPA. Good carbonation. This DIPA tastes very sweet, honey, pine, mango, orange peal, tropical fruits.  Going down, everything sticks right there. Then the malt kicks in on the back end to balance everything out perfectly.  Really tasty beer!  Or should I say sucks? Top shelf beer here people. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Pours a clear and deep golden color with two fingers of thick foam. Minor lacing on glass. Smell is very piney and earthy, with notes of honey and sour citrus. A very hoppy and piney taste explosion on first taste, followed by honey and citrus notes. Mouth feel is slightly bitter, but not bad. Overall a top shelf brew."
""
""
"Overall: Very classic west coast IPA."
""
"I never had the original, but Sucks does not suck, but it does have a strong flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really like this DIPA. It is very unique and easy to drink. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  considering it's three months old in the bottle, pretty damn good.  the malt has overcome some of the hop flavor, and that caramel/mango sweetness isn't my personal favorite, but even that taste note keeps in perfect step with the style ... and there's no mistaking what this is, a pillar of the American double IPA community.  it's citrusy, sweet, bitter, big and just lightly crisp enough to stay drinkable.  I'd hop at the chance to drink this under a month old.  As it is, it's still dang good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Come on! Poured out of a 32 oz bottle! For the style, okay. Look is amazing in the glass, light amber. I can't locate the bottle date.  A little sweet and a very slightly malty taste. Overall, enjoyable, again, 32 oz bottle!"
""
""
"A perfect blend of hops and smoothness. Clean aftertaste. Great brew. Comes in a 32oz bottle. Pour a pint for yourself and someone you love. This is life, my friend."
"Absolutely rock-solid beer. The look, smell, taste and feel of Sucks puts it a class of its own. Delicious and worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
"The winner here is the complexity of grain. Excellent hops inviting the body of grain. Great offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Another hoppy beer that I have found to be very balanced. I don't always enjoy super hoppy beers but I will by this again. Especially for $7."
""
""
"Crisp, a little citrusy, hoppy in all the right ways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good but standard citrusy ipa. A bit sweet. Unusually light for a DIPA, but everything else is usual. Some nice grapefruit notes bump this up a level"
""
""
""
""
"Bursting with grapefruit smell, a little spiciness. Lots of hop bitterness"
""
""
""
"Not hoppy enough for my taste."
""
""
""
"Overall very good.  Better than Double Jack.  Not as good as  DirtWolf and Sculpin."
""
"I like how Lagunitas always wants to tell you their life story on their labels..."
""
""
""
"Malty sweet goodness with a hint of citrus hops. The 2014 bottle topped out at 8% ABV."
"I can see both views of being very good and of being just ok good. Either way super easy drinking. Def sweet but mixed well with the hops and malt. Great mouth feel, hops up front and a malty finish behind. Nice beer."
""
""
"Overall: Very disappointed. Oh I scored it good, but this is it? It tastes like every other Lagunitas IPA."
"Totally lives up to the hype."
""""Sucks""" is that last word that I'd use to describe this gem."
""
""
""
""
"But seriously, this beer is superior to it's predecessor and is quite possibly the best beer in the world. Lagunitas does suck for not making this available in 6 packs this year!!"

"12oz bottle into nonic. Pours clear golden with a white head that settles to a cap and leaves some patches of lace. Aroma is pine, tropical fruit, bread, alcohol. Taste is firm bitter orange peel, pine resin, and tobacco followed by subtle bread and caramel sweetness. Medium bodied, oily, creamy, and thick texture, average-to-lively carbonation, and a long, bitter finish."

""
""
""
""
""

"What a great substitute for another outstanding beer.  Really a tasty malty IPA."
""

""
"O: Of the nicest IPAs I've had; well-balanced and pleasant without being face murderingly hoppy."
""
""
""
""
"I'm rating this beer based on its fresh rating, and not docking points, but the freshness issues need to be noted."
""
""

"For shelf turd isnot bad"
""

"Maybe old bottle?  Not impressed.  Poured half of it out.   Yucky."

"Hoppy while also tasting of oats and barley. This ale is boastfully dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite beer, perfect amount of hops, great taste and lots of alcohol."
""
""
"Only beer I've dumped in awhile. Just can't enjoy anything by Lagunitas."
""
"Wasn't sure what to think when i saw a label that said it sucks! I was actually pleasantly surprised.. great DIPA!  Very hoppy smell but sweet aromatic flavor with little lingering aftertaste.. Would definitely get again!"
"Excellent DIPA! Clear deep amber, full white head and plenty of lacing. The aroma was wonderful citrus and pine hop goodness! Taste is just as good as the nose."
""
""
"O-It is good. Not something I would seek out again but I'm glad I picked up the double pint fatty bottle. The price point was something that I couldn't ignore either. $6.50 for a 32 oz bottle is a very, very fair deal in this day and age."
""
""
"Deep Amber color with a one finger creamy head pour into a RuinTen tulip.  Smells like freshly mowed lawn.  Tasted smooth dank caramel and sweet malty notes.  Well balanced.  Boozy, but not overwhelming.  Easy to drink - perhaps too easy if I'm not cautious.  Overall, will definitely be included in the weekly lineup going forward.  4.5/5."
"Just not my cup of tea.  Sweet, malty mess."
"Overall: I really liked this beer. The fact that it came in such a wonderful package at a great price is pure bonus. I have another bottle in the cellar that I don't think will last more than a few more weeks around here."
""
""
""
""
"I was honestly really impressed with this beer. The bitterness was at a perfect level for a double IPA. Not too strong of aroma and the taste lasted. 32oz for $6 I was really surprised. This is definitely a beer I'd drink with my buddies. I'm surprised a beer like this isn't more expensive. Lucky us."

"Malty/spicey/fruity/sharp/clean/thick flavors. Excellent mouthfeel. Awesome beer."

"Still has that candy wave upfront like brown shugga with some nice, light fruit notes right behind, mostly orange & even a little honey.  Finishes with a little hop kick, but not an overly bitter DIPA. Refreshing, festive and smooth, an excellent beer for those who like pales that don't bludgeon you with hops but still have an unique profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm ready for a hoppy bite and for my wife to pass, since she isn't into bitterness. But this bad boy is totally balanced. Taste is sweet and smooth, with a hop bite on the finish that lingers on the back of the tongue for just a moment.  She's actually drinking it without complaint."
"but when and if you can find it on tap...oh my glory!!! have two."
"Love it! Brown Shugga is great, but SUCKS is fantastic!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good, interesting beer. I like it."
"Great DIPA edition, and I recall trying this once with last year's version and liking that one even more. More citrus and tropical fruit on the resin than pine. It should be a year-round beer, as it stacks above much of the other countless examples of this style without going far out of bounds in terms of radical ingredients/ taste. Based on the lengthy, self-deprecating description of this release, they really screwed up (their words much harsher), however I disagree that they did (as I suspect even they do). Solid stuff, and in a 1-quart bottle of under $5.00 cost, a huge plus. IPA devotees, try this."
""
"Would probably buy and drink again. Very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious sweet brown sugar finish in a nice and hoppy ale."
"Overall:  I don't remember liking this quite as much in years past, but this year it really hits the spot, and is spot on. Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"For the price-volume ratio, this beer definitely sucks like Primus."
""
""
""
"not that great but not bad by any means"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tropical fruit bomb with incredible, room filling aromatics. So glad this now comes year round in sixers."
"O - 5.00 - My idea of a perfect IPA, definitely a must try for fans of the style!!!"
""

"5 Star beer. The best double I've tried"

"Taste: More of the bitter, acidic citrus and pine hops up front, with some submerged tropical notes underneath. A solid IPA for sure, but somehow not one I’d care to revisit. A hop bomb, and tailor-made for hardcore hop-fetishists."
"Pours a beautiful golden honey which shimmers from the heavy body. Fluffy white head 2 fingers thick. Smells absolutely fantastic. Maybe the best smelling IPA I have ever put my nostrils to. Very sweet citrus. The spice of the rye malts is present, strong orange citrus notes with spicy, pine, resinous, hop taste. Great balance. Piney hop resin left on the lips. The body is medium-heavy yet the nice citrus balance makes it feel a lot lighter. After taste of strong piney hop resin."
""
""
""
"The Rest:  A great hop bomb.  Tons of hop character but enough malt sweetness to balance things out."
"Lagunitas Sucks is a resin heavy, mango nosed, bitter and sweet ale. The complexity and deep hop profile here makes it an interesting and multi-layered beer with a unique taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer very tasty, pours a deep amber. It does not suck"
""
""
""
"I won't even dig deep into why I love this.  It is singularly one of the best ipas that has been created by a brewery."
"this beer does not suck, as the name would imply"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Initial smell is pretty hoppy. The initial taste is very hoppy and bitter. I feel like the is no backbone to this. But this is still good. I would prefer hop stoopid over this anyday."
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not that impressive for the category"
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew, I can see why it is highly sought after.  Love the 32oz bottle.  Doesn't go overboard on the hops, but it is a very nice profile, and has a good balance of malts to compliment the hops.  Very well rounded beer."
""
"My long hunt for this beer was worth the wait.   Really good balance of flavor and body.  This one seems to be firing on all cylinders.   The gentle sweetness that is present from the brown sugar gives it a delightful flavor that balances out the hops.  Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O): Very good, yet after some time hunting for this i just didnt get the definitive outstanding feeling like i did with a heady topper, dirt wolf or hopslam. Very good none the less, teases the line, yet just not enough to set it apart for me."
""
"Disappointed.  Incredible bang for your buck but tastes just like yet another American IPA.  I'll pass."
"Overall - A well crafted DIPA from Lagunitas. The citrus hop profile in this one is done very well. I wish the malts were a little more predominate to balance some of the tropical fruit flavours. Other than that, a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I have heard so much about this beer and I have never seen it to buy until late last week.  I'm far from a Lagunitas fanboy, but overall I'd say it pretty much lives up the hype as it's a damn good beer.  However, don't get carried away and think it's an all timer, it's not.  Excellent beer that is very fruity and hoppy and enjoyable.  PS:  Love the large format bottle!"
""
"Thick and tasty! A hop-bomb, but rich enough to stand out."
""
"An exceptional brew if you see it get it because you may never see it again."

"Excellent!"

"O (4) – I liked this one.  It wasn’t what I was expecting by the style or name.  But I can see the allure here.  I wish it didn’t come in quart bottles, but that’s not a huge deal for me."

"Pours a reddish amber color with a two finger off white head.  There is a lot of carbonation and quite a bit of lacing.  The odor is herbal, malty, sweet, a little bit of citrus orange, grapefruit, resin, pine, earthy.  The taste is very malty, resin, some sweetness, grapefruit, spices, some dry bitterness throughout."
"Very good, but it was a bit thin in the feel department.  Good smell and taste - a good IPA."
""
""
"Good but derivative and overly alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear golden with small head, smells very hoppy and citrusy, tastes piney slightly grassy with hops as the front of the taste, mouthfeel is creamy and silky but thin"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  great hop forward, juicy IPA.  Very sweet and fruity.  I like the bomber, as that's about the perfect serving size for this ale.  One if my favorite Lagunitas offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only criticism I have about this beer is why the heck is Primus not doing a commercial for it?  Somebody's slackin' down in advertising...."
""
""
""
""
"A good DIPA, nice adn ctirusy with a good hop profile but not mindblowing."
""

"This beer does not suck! Despite the large format I can't bring myself to dump out any for the dead homies... It's just too delishious!"
""
""
"Overall (4.55): This has the big dank, bright fruit flavor without the bitter mouthfeel; Exacly what i go for in an IPA/DIPA. This goes down like a 5% beer, not 8%. I'm glad i grabbed the last two 32oz bottles off the shelf. Considering the price, this is at the top of the list of best beers for the value. In fact, this may even be one of my top 5 IPAS i have tried right up there with Enjoy By, Head Hunter, and Sculpin to name a few. Get it while you can"

"Clear yellow-amber pour with a two finger foamy white head with great retention and crazy lacing.  The nose is sweet and citrusy with tons of brown sugar and caramel along with hints of grass, tangerine, and pine.  The taste follows suit with the piney, resiny hops even more prevalent along with sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, orange peel, tangerine, and tropical fruit.  The mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and really oily, with incredible balance and drinkability.  Overall, this is incredibly bold and flavorful, yet totally balanced and drinkable.  I drank the 32 oz. bottle and was left wanting more.  Highly recommended!"

"Poured a cloudy amber body with one finger of fluffy white head. A very nice looking DIPA, true to style. Scents of pine resin, dank, vegetal, earthy hops, light spicy hops, medium-light notes of orange peel, tangerine, juniper berries and a medium-light presence of alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of an excellent DIPA that is true to form, very dank and powerful and quite pleasant. Flavor begins with medium-high bitterness with notes of dank, resinous, herbal hops and pine resin, orange peel, medium-light alcohol, and a very light caramel malt backbone. Middle is still bitter, with strong notes of pine resin and resinous hops and bitter, dank, earthy vegetal hops. Finish is bitter with strong notes of pine resin, juniper berries, dank, earthy hops, medium levels of alcohol, orange zest. Aftertaste is pine resin, light alcohol and dank, earthy hops. Overall impression of flavor is of a very bitter, dank, resinous DIPA that is quite nice and very flavorful. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with medium carbonation and a drying, resinous feel that starts slick, but finishes drying. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice DIPA that is very easy to drink. Overall this is so good DIPA that has a full aroma and a wonderfully bitter flavor that is resinous, piney and strong. The mouthfeel is the standard feel that aids the experience. A very nice DIPA that is true to form and very nice."

"Another great brew from Lagunitas. Not surprising as everything I have had from them is great. An amber pour, clear, with a nice foamy head and good lacing. Hops and floral nose, mild bitterness, and a nice balance. Worth the wait here in New England for an annual taste, and solid. Held it's own in a tasting lineup with Stone Enjoy By, Jai Alia, and some killer home brew from Bobhouse brewery. Looking for another bomber or two."

"Seasonal beers are not normally among my favorites. But this one is a little different. For one thing, brown sugar substitute or not, hints of faux brown sugar are immediately apparent from the first sip. Not too much but it is noticeable. The flavor is a great compliment to the well-blended mix of grains found in this beer. But what really got me was the """holy cow""" moment when I remembered I was drinking an Imperial IPA. My favorite part of this beer is that, as an IPA, it relies on flavors other than hops to set it apart. If you are looking for a super-hoppy pour, this is not your bag. But if you just want a really smooth brew, with very smooth taste, you've found it."

"Bought this in a quart bottle and shared with some friends at a party.  The color is clear amber with a long lasting thick and creamy head.  Citrus hops dominate the smell and the taste too.  I note grapefruit as well as some pine.  While the hops hit you hard at the start, they give way to a caramel malt flavor and the finish is quite clean.  Overall this is just a great beer that I could sip on daily."

"Sweet and boozy. Great beer. Excellent as a BBQ marinade base also. If you get the bomber drink it with a friend unless you want to take a nap under the table."
""
""
"O - More balanced than an IPA, as you'd expect for an Imperial IPA.  Slightly sweet and cloying finish detracts some from the clean hops and malt, but overall an enjoyable beer."

"Pours a golden straw color with a thin white head. Huge tropical fruit aroma right off the bat. A little citrus too. No detectable alcohol. Taste is huge tropical fruits, dankness, and citrus. Still no alcohol. One of the smoothest drinking DIPAs out there. This stuff is liquid gold. The blend of malts is perfect and makes this beer incredibly drinkable and balanced. Overall one of the best DIPAs around. I just wish they had it in 6 packs more often. The 32oz bottle is a bit ridiculous, but priced pretty fairly. Make sure to check the bottled on date. These things have become shelf turds."

"Pours a straw yellow with noticeable carbonation. Thick foam head that reduces over several minutes to excellent even lacing. Smells of pine trees and grass. Some lemon. Immediate nose of pine, lemons, and bitters. Mid-palate seamless shift to barley, malt, and sweetness. On the back palate there is great hop notes: lemongrass, wheat, and toasted barley. Settles with bitter and sour notes on the aftertaste. Very complex. A lot going on here. Takes several sips to take it all in. Very good, 4.25 out of 5. Recommended."

"Pours with a very thick head, that will leave a ton of lacing on your glass afterwards."

"I've only tried this once but what a wonderful experience! I found this in a little shop in Rhode Island and the owner said they can't keep it on the shelves. All the elegant taste you expect of Lagunitas, with their signature background of pine and citrus. The hint of sweetness adds to the overall complexity. I just wish they could make this on a regular schedule."

"Pours a clear beautiful amber. Smells great. Piney, citrus and fruits. Tastes delicious. super good. Just the right amount of bitter. Very bitter as a matter of fact but it works out great. I think because it is balanced so well with everything else that the bitterness works. Great beer."

"Smell is incredible, taste is great, price is right. More drinkable than any other beer this site classifies as DIPA. Tied with Sumpin' Sumpin' for the best brew Lagunitas has to offer, in my mind."

The malts are both sugary and cracker with a multigrain earthiness. Very unique. The more I think of it, the more I can recommend this brew. This brew is recommended."

"Pours a semi hazy holden off-road he color. Two finger head quickly died down to one finger and lingered.  The nose is a combination of fruity tropical hops, piney hops, floral hops, even some lemon. Basically every kind of hop character imaginable.  The flavor has a very present sweet malt base, but a strong hop flavor. Peppery at first, and then it dies into a faint bitterness. Really good. I'm much more impressed with it this time around.  My last one must have been very old."

"I have been cornering the market on this stuff... its a bit hard to find here in Vegas... when I see it I pick up all that I can"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As as the cap cracked I smelled sweet tropical fruit. Nose in glass I found a wonderful combination of faint caramel and a hopnoxiuos blend of pineapple, orange, mango, and honey. Taste follows the smell. Caramel is here but not in the usual """heavy""" way common to so many IPAs. Instead in lends just a hint of sweetness to the hop medley described above. The tasted pretty fresh to me, but I have a feeling that one I knew was a couple of weeks past bottling would be a completely different animal."

"Pours a very nice golden yellow color, with some nice carbonation, which leaves a very nice thick creamy two-finger white head, and some nice thick creamy sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes, piney, and a nice touch of citrus. The taste is hoppy, with some maltyness, piney, nice citrus note. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Nice to have some nice Lagunitas brews here in UT. One of the best breweries out there for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional. Pours a hazy dark yellow/orange with a thin head that trails the glass. The smell is full of hops but also a toasty aroma. The taste was full of different flavors. Started off mellow with a yeasty flavor which then exploded with piney flavors from the hops. The finish had a lot of malt in it making a very refreshing finish. Loved this one."

"In my opinion, this is Lagunitas' best offering. Heads and shoulders above the Hop Stoopid I had last night (although the Hop Stoopid was about 4 months old compared to the 2 month old Sucks). Of the 50-60 IPAs/DIPAs I've had, this is now in my top 5, and if it becomes readily available in my area year-round, I'll be buying at least 2-3 every time I can find it under a couple months old."

"Lagunita's Sucks has a bold taste and aftertaste. It is perfect for a relaxing evening lounging about. Complex yet simple. Smooth and strong. It also has an interesting story, in that, it was only made due to a mistake on the breweries part. Simply put, it made an impression every time I tasted it."
"Hits the glass bright and golden, a range of yellows, nice frothy head. Smells incredible. It's that note of floral and fruit that surprises. Tastes sweet and thick, citrus, along with the usual IPA profiles, and the DIPA dense mouthfeel. Just kinda glorious. Bold and bright. Pretty damn impressive."

"Bought a 32oz bottle after hearing great things. The bottle is dated 6/3/14, so its about two months old as I pour it. The beer has a pleasant appearance. The color is a nice light-copper with a sizable head that slowly dissipates. The initial aroma is a tepid, piney hop aroma with a strong malt presence and a bit of citrus. When you give the glass a good swirl, it unleashes a strong orange and citrus aroma. The taste is full of juicy citrus and light pine. A modest hop bitterness then hits the palate. The bitterness is followed by a distinct orange rind flavor that sits on the tongue. There is a ton of hop flavor, but modest bitterness: I like it! The carbonation is muted. The beer is medium bodied with a sort of wet, “juicy” mouthfeel, which suits the beer well. Overall, a really good beer and, at $7 for a 32oz bottle, will definitely be a brew I’d buy again. I would love to try a fresher bottle, too!"
""
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel had a raspy texture. Finished smoother and full bodied."

"A slightly darker than golden appearance. A great floral/hoppy smell with sumpin extra. The mixture of hop, pine, floral and slight fruitiness is wonderful, with that little subtle extra makes this one of my top 5 tasting beers. Goes down smooth for a hoppy ale and has a perfect little bite yet finishes smooth due to added substitute. Just bought 4 32 oz bottles. Need to go back to stock up before gone!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't make a comparison as to how well Sucks holds up to Brown Shugga, but if it's any indication, it means that particular beer is just as mediocre. Disappointed because the first two Lagunitas I've had have done nothing but underwhelm me. Hoping the next couple offerings I'll try before the end of the summer show different results."
""
""
""
"Overall one of the best beers I ever tasted. I ordered the beer at a local burger, and it was a great find. Golden brown with a good layer of foam on top, that stay all the way to the last drop. You could taste the brown sugar, but not over powering. Very easy going down. Truly a great beer."

"The beer poured with a lively orange yellow with a healthy head. Looks cool in the glass and in the 32 ounce bottle. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Brown sugar ale, but everyone knows this is an IPA. Tastes pretty similar to the regular Lagunitas IPA, but the taste is a little bit sweeter. That doesn't mean it's like molasses or caramel, it's definitely an IPA that kicks pretty hard but goes down nice. Good for a hearty meal, and versatile to drink in hot or cold weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I will definitely be buying this again and am very interested to see if it continues to live up to the hype on a second or third go. Right now: Loving this brew!"
""
""
""
"Really liked this beer. Special ordered an entire case at the recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed. The beer itself is fruity tasting and leaves you wanting more. The ABV is high enough to give this beer a good kick. It has the familiar taste of a Lagunitas beer. Slightly bitter to the taste as in a mixture of an Ale and IPA, easy for me to drink."

"Poured from bottle into rocks type glass from hotel. Nice thick foamy head that persists and laces well, at least in this odd glass. Appearance is completely transparent straw color with lots of carb coming up from glass. Nose is kinda funky, almost savory in a way. Had this beer a lot but didn't examine nose this thoroughly before. Taste is malt forward and followed by a hop bitterness that has flavors of pepper, some citrus peel, and finally some booziness at the end, which i actually like. Mouthfeel is where it should be. Overall an outstanding beer that is a go to whenever available."

"Pours a nice yellow beer. Has some foam forming. Aroma is very faint, almost inexistent. Taste is not of a hoppy beer. It tastes more like a lager. It does have a distinct sweetness, like brown sugar, or molasses, but it is not refined. It tastes a lot like a cheap beer with no hops."

"Hazed golden orange colour, 2 fingers of white head, lots of lace. Smell is of pine and tropical fruit, citrus, lots of grapefruit and orange, juicy mango with a bit of lightly sweet malt as well. Taste is dry and hoppy, tons of citrus and dank pine flavours, grapefruit and mango, bit of orange in the aftertaste, oily hops and some lightly sweet malt. Slick and oily mouthfeel, lightly carbonated, medium-full body. Amazing stuff, truly one of the great beers of the style, something I would love to drink on a regular basis."

"Lagunitas Brown Shugga This winter American strong ale pours a copperish ruby, with a touch of haze~ Solid head and lacing to follow~ Nose is Hops, Booze, Pine and a touch of Citrus~ Palate is just a scotch above medium, very sticky sugary presence~ Taste is Sugar (shocker) HOPS! maybe just didn't expect such a bitter hoppy beer, I expected more of a Warmer/Brown Ale by the name and label~ Also, Citrus, Banana, Pine, and some Earthy Floral ness, a touch of Maple and Peach~ A bitter and boozy brew that is definitely for hop heads~ Im super picky about hoppy brews~ The sugar does a nice job of balancing the bitterness on a bruising 10%ABV~ This is a unique brew~ Finishes a bit too bitter and boozy for my liking, although I could blame that on the season~ Overall: 7.3"

"I love the quart bottles- one reason why I bought this beer- to bottle my homebrew. I had fond memories of brown sugga ale, which I haven't reviewed here, because evidently they %O$#@) up royally and stopped making it, or some ridiculous thing. Anyway, this is an intriguing beer, with the hops lingering precariously on the edge of balance with a curiously low bodied beer with a pretty high alcohol content."

"Mouthfeel is very pleasant and bready with a bit of spice feel. The rye stands out considerably on the back of the tongue as well, long after the sip. This is a wonderful beer. Please don't stop making it."

"O - I don't normally seek out hoppy beer. Picked this one up on a world beer tour challenge and glad I did. Really nice and enjoyable especially based on the fact that its a complete opposite of my favor of porters and stouts. Would definitely recommend and will buy again. Looking forward to an easy finish of the 32 oz bottle."

"This is a very good brew. I'll admit I didn't read the label all the way since I just am a fan of the brewery when I grabbed this one. It's a tad to dry and hoppy for my taste. Beautiful citrus ale color, lots of bubbles, a nice thin typical ale head. Very refreshing taste and smell. The smell really previews the hop taste that is to come. Taste is very dry and hop flavored. Lightly sweet and citrusy though. Pretty easy drinking, if you enjoy a dry hoppy brew this is probably going to be up your alley. It's a little to hop for my likings. Very high abv, so considering that it's very drinkable. Very refreshing, would highly recommend this."

"A finely made ale with a very pleasing sensory depth and complexity. It looks great, smells wonderful, and tastes incredibly fine. There's a gentle smoothness to the feel with an off-setting hop bite while the grain and hop flavors tango passionately around your palate. This would be a great beer to have available year-round."
"Overall: I'm still pretty new to craft beer, so I jump around a lot in terms of what I drink. Sucks, however, is one that I have been coming back to again and again. It's definitely my favorite from Lagunitas and really got me into the West coast style IPAs. Sucks is an excellent beer with an original flavor profile that entices me every time I crack one open."

"This is a superb beer, easily my favorite Lagunitas offering. Pours a lovely golden color. Very aggressive piney hop smell. Very gentle smooth flavor, excellent hop/malt balance. Great supportive aftertaste. This is a top tier offering. I can't get Pliny or Heady Topper, so frame of reference is limited, but I love this stuff."

"O: I love this beer for many reasons. Personally, I like IPA's and DIPA's by they can get old and overbearing, often being a little heavy. But Lagunitas Sucks is the quite the opposite. It drinks like a pale ale, making it nice and session-able. The flavor is smooth and enjoyable with the hints of citrus, leading me to think that it may have be hopped/dry-hopped with citra hops. Definitely recommend getting it if you have the chance!"

"Pale orange in color with a finger of white head that retains well. A big fresh peach smell is the first thing I get, with an awesome blend of orange, grapefruit, floral hops, pine needle, and sweet bread malts. Really a great smelling beer. In the mouth, it starts out like a classic IPA with grapefruit and lemon zest flavors, then it really becomes a beast of its own with sweeter fruit flavors like pineapple and peach. Toward the end I pick up a lot of mouth-coating hop oil and pine needle. It's not as bitter as it sounds though. The bitterness is muted by a strong, sweet bread malt presence from the beginning of the tongue until the end. Medium body with good carbonation. A beer everyone can, and should, enjoy."

"Welcome back to Alberta, Sucks. Here's hoping you stick around more consistently. One of the more acclaimed and storied DIPAs on this website and more generally, this is the sort of thing a guy like me will go ballistic over, buying a case or two to share and overindulge in during a shitty work week. Quite a light color truth be told, a golden sunset orange with a reasonably prominent beige head. Who cares what it looks like, really. Smells like a tangerine dream, massive dank grapefruit, mandarin and lime on the nose along with tropical starfruit or perhaps guava, melon, and a grainy spice note that I attribute to the hybrid grain bill. A taste reveals a brew positively bursting at the seams with citrus juices and aromatic oils, goes from lime to navel orange to grapefruit to sweet pine needles in a rapid assault and then stabilizes somewhat into a heady mixture of sugery nutty malts, papaya spears, pineapple, muskmelon, orange Creamsickle, blackberry, and faint garlic. Amazingly smooth and drinkable despite the assertive fresh flavors, not a palate wrecker and lacking obnoxious protruding off-flavors like really strong pine resin (sometimes I crave such flavors but here they would wreck the mood). It does make the mouth tingle, almost like Sichaun pepper. I do get a little floral flavor but by and large this is a fruit bowl. Moderately thick body and finishes wet, with the citrus and tropical fruit flavors staying until the woody bitter end. Notably though, the bitterness is not coarse and I could (and have!) consume this in quantity because of the dangerously smooth mouthfeel. You can taste alcohol but not to the brew's detriment. Carbonation manages to stay out of the way. Wow. Believe the hype. A cornucopia of hop flavors and perhaps edges out Green Flash as my current favorite IPA ... I'd have to check the ratings. Right now its all about the moment."

"overall i don't understand the big hype behind this brew at all. I don't consider this a double or imperial IPA, over 9% ABV would be a double or imperial. The label is deceiving, if you have never had The old brown shugga then you have no idea this is an IPA. the label just says ALE and looks very cheaply designed and made. A craft beer without a freshness date? i have to decode your hard to read black codes in the store? For 10 bucks a six pack I was very disappointed. label says limited release, yet it is available year around. anyway a decent IPA NOT a double or imperial IPA at all. I will NOT be buying this again."

"Gotta say, I don't really get the hype for this one; to me, it's an above average IPA but nothing spectacular. Pours a transparent pale copper with moderate white fluffiness. Citrus and hops in the nose. Smooth hops; not too intense. Pleasant bready malts balance the hops nicely. Lots of fruits on the palate - orange, grapefruit, tangerine. Not too hoppy. Well balanced. Fairly dry without much of a finish. Light bodied; right for the style but nothing special. It's good, don't get me wrong, but there are much better DIPAs out there."

"Was fortunate enough to land 1.5 cases in mid January. It took me a try or two to appreciate this beer, but this is really special stuff. First of all it's 41 bucks a case.. Lagunitas Always does a great job of offering high end goods at very affordable prices. Best thing about this beer is its subtlety. Its almost more malty than hoppy, but whatever it is, it just makes for effortless enjoyment. Really enjoyed this!"

"I bought this beer thinking, for some strange reason, that it was a substitute for the old """Brown Shugga""" Lagunitas brewed. Nothing could be further from the truth, so I have no idea what the name is about. With that out of the way, this is a competent but unremarkable west coast IPA--big bitterness without much else to distract. If I liked IPAs, I might be a fan, but to me this is just another one-dimensional hop bomb. The fact that the label betrayed me doesn't help..."

"Pours out beautifully clear gold with a thick tight soapy head that clings to the glass with webby lacing. Smell is a huge hit of citrus and pine, with just a hint of hay. Taste is all citrus and pine. Massive orange, grapefruit pith and lemon zest. Full and silky smooth but still refreshing. Very clean and tasty. A nice change of pace from other West Coast DIPAs that tend to be much maltier."

"Very clear amber colored pour, lots of bubbles, durable head. The looks remind me of Sierra Nevada Celebration, and that's a very good start. The smell was highly potent out of the glass at an arm's length. Very citric hops with a touch of pear, and the intensity is great. I could just smell this beer for a while. The taste another hop assault, as the grapefruit, tangerine, and bitter orange flavors just hit all at once. The malt is not much of a presence here except providing some sticky sweetness. Medium dense and creamy feeling in the mouth. This was a very well crafted DIPA. There is of course no substitute for Brown Shugga, but I hope they keep this one around too. Otherwise they would really suck :)"

"I've been enjoying this beauty almost all of the crappy dark winter now and with what seemed to be and endless supply in my area now drying up I decided it's time time stock up and review. Poured from a bottle into a Lagunitas widemouth jar mug. Beautiful honey golden color with about a half finger head. The aromas will about knock you out, very floral with pine and plenty of hops as well as some honey. Taste is amazing nice sweet honey upfront followed but a bit of pine with hops galore. Great bitterness that is not overpower but lingers nicely. Good body without feeling filling or heavy. This is really a nice beer that won't let you down."

"UPDATE 2/24/15: Portioned the rest out to myself up until practically the day of my annual Florida trip in early Jan. and enjoyed them all, although none had as much hop flavor compared to that first fresh sixpack last year.  Supremely disappointed to discover (too late) that no sixpacks are being made.  I finally broke down and bought one of the new quart bottles for $7 (had held off because they were $8-10 around here and it was just a turn off to have to pay almost double per ounce compared to last year) despite the fact that it had no readable bottling date on it, and sure enough it was OK but had no particular hop flavor.  Perhaps I'll find a fresh dated bottle or two this year, in the mreantime hoping the sixpacks come back next Jan, albeit certainly at a big price jump (I'll guess $13-15/6 at least from previously $10-11/6.)"

I've been a huge Lagunitas fan for awhile, even being from Maine. We've gotten almost every beer they make. The Dogtown IPA and Daytime are perfect summer drinkable beers. The Sucks is perfect for fall/winter. It's been my go-to beer for a couple months now. It is exploding with flavor!"

"O - This is a unique beer with character that I would try again. I think it would be very satisfying on a hot summers day, but one would be enough. That said, I do not want to overhype it. I would like it more if it hit a few more notes in terms of flavors and was a little less dry on the palate."

Im gonna keep writing because beer advocate insists that i have 250 words.

"A heavy-handed pour caused a pseudo-cascade that resulted in a finger of rocky, tawny head with decent retention. Color was a deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity and since Croesus, Midas and Mammon were already here, they decided to hang around a bit longer. The nose was nothing less than resinous and it seemed to be leaking pine tar. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops went right to work, coating my tongue with sticky pine goodness. This doesn't suck at all! They lied to me. My hops fix was finally starting to take 'hold, but I wonder what my upper limit is. The label marks it as 63.21 IBUs and I could sense every one of them. My eyes actually began to water a little bit. Finish was dry, but not to the point that I needed oxygen afterwards. It remained very piney and minty and it really did not suck."

"Pours a golden color, translucent in the glass. After sitting for a bit there is still a millimeter of head at the top of the halfway drank tuple glass. Completely white top with a small amount active carbonation rising to the top. Grapefuit smell. Devoid of the pine smell that accompanies some hoppy beers. Really bitter pale ale from the initial taste, finishes with a long after taste on the tounge where pineyness appears. Devoid of sweetness. Flavor lingers for too long IMO. I am not a huge fan of this. Can slightly tell the abv is above 5 at 7.85 while the IBU is 63. I'm really not a fan of the taste or shall I say after taste on this one."

"Pour is mostly clear orange amber with a fairly tight white head and strong lacing. Nose has a bit of caramel malt and notes of bread. The hops are citrusy and piney.

Tastes hop-heavy, pleasant bitter, CLEAN, floral, citrus-y, maybe even ginger. Beautiful. Nice and bubbly on the tongue too. One of my favorites."
""
"O: Very good beer. Lots of good hops flavor and very drinkable."

"Overall. I like this beer a lot. Something I could drink more than one of. Glad I picked up a 6 pack of this. Money well spent."

"O: Really good, one of my favorites from the brewery, but way overrated. Still, I'd recommend giving this a try if you like IPAs."
""

""
""
"O - For me what really is the showcase of this beer is the aroma. From the very beginning the aroma is very inviting and greatly shows the hops used, but I wasn't too much of a fan of the dryness to this beer. I seem to enjoy IPAs with much more body and a malt backbone to them, and although I see why this beer is thoroughly enjoyed and sought after, I would have enjoyed it more if there was more complex malty flavor that didn't leave such a dry finish."

"O: Outstanding hoppiness in this delicious DIPA."

"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass, nice golden brown color, delicious tropical, grapefruit aroma, and the taste follows the aroma perfectly. It's like a grapefruit-gasm in my mouth pussy. Incredibly easy to drink for a double. Def an instant favorite of mine. Pretty much as close to perfect that you can get here in murdaland"

"You hear about it ad nauseam around the holidays. Every beer store is boasting they have it, the charge an arm and a leg for it and then I found it in a grocery store for a reasonable price and picked it up. I did not go into this one with high hopes. I have not really had a good experience with the other beers I have had from this brewery, maybe I just like East coast breweries, or at least from the Rockies eastward. Anyway, I was actually really impressed with this one. The color and everything was lighter than I had expected it to be. The smell was sweet candy, with some hops present. The taste was where it was at. This beer was very well balanced. A great mixture of hops and sweetness. I have been on a lighter beer trend lately and for some reason I expected this one to be more on the darker side. I was overly surprised with this one and I will have to say they did make a beer that I enjoyed. I will try this one again next year and I hope it remains consistent. I have heard it may become more of a year round thing. Which might lighten its luster a bit, but over all I would try this one from time to time, if I caught it on sale like I did this time."

"Don't believe I had a DIPA as creamy as this. This is a west coast IPA to perfection. Ridiculous amount of hops yet not overpowering bitter. This could easily be a session IPA if not for the high abv. Second best IPA I have had and probably in the top ten of beers I have tried. Nice brew."
""
""
""
"I absolutely love this beer. Seriously. Its like """beerfest""" quotes good. I really can't find fault with it without sounding like some nitpicky douche bag. One of my favorite offerings from Lagunitas, who is one of my favorite breweries. I only wish they'd brew it more often."

"Pours out golden and with an orange blush on it. Fat creamy head of off white foam that lasts and leaves sticky lace. I was expecting a bigger nose but it's a bit shy. Sultry even. It has a tropical fruit sweetness and bit of mango. Soft suggestion of pine but nothing sharp. Fresh ripe orange and a bit of sugar for a malt presence on the nose. Some orange peel to really sweeten it and brighten it. Taste is a light delicious juicy mouthful of liquid fruit. Fresh orange with tropical underpinnings. Gentle pine. The malt is supple and graceful and like a bit of sugar. It drinks with a bit of hop oil on the body of the beer, medium mouthfeel and has a touch of sticky resin to coat the mouth and leave a softly moderate bitter. Dries the palate and finishes with a faint spice and a bit more bitter with a pleasant aftertaste like fresh orange juice. There is no alcohol on this beer save for a touch of warmth. Drinks so easily and has an amazing lightness ."

"O - You know I didn't want to believe this beers hype. To my surprise it surpasses my expectations. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and I might prefer it to Heady, yes I said it. Big citrus notes, surprising balance and an unbelievable level of drink ability. I bought a 6 pack and I'm going out tomorrow for another."

"Friday's beer of the week. After reading the great reviews got off early and happened to have a 6 chilled just right. Pours bright gold with a brown sugar head. Lacing close to perfect, rippling down the glass sides, like beach sand after a blow. Aroma does have the sweet fruit smell, not quite to pineapple, but close. Steady carbonation feeding that Carmel head. Mouth feel is fresh and invigorating. Taste, ya grapefruit , high on the bitters. I keep swishing the brew over the tongue, cheek to cheek , trying to find the floral oils, of orange, tangerine, crushed fruit bowl... Not there... Looking for the mystery, the hidden flavor which puzzles the taste buds... Not there... Good beer, pouring number 2, but hoping for a whole lot more. Far from SUCKS, quite good and very drinkable. Cheers!"

"O - This ranks as my 2nd favorite IPA, and it is readily available fresh almost everywhere they sell beer (in the Bay Area). Easy to drink, great taste, great mouthfeel. I have recommended this beer to ALL of my friends/coworkers who are even slightly interested in beer (even the ones who say they don't like IPAs too much), and will continue to do so. This is definitely my favorite beer from Lagunitas."
""

"Overall, If you like craft beer find this and try it. It is an excellent beer. Every time I go to the liquor store I'll buy a sixer till it's gone."
""
""
""
"O- Lagunitas always delivers above average brews but this one may be my favorite. Huge hop presence with citrus running through its veins. Personally I favor a beer built that way and """sucks""" tickles my fancy. - no pun intended. Damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- YUM! This beer lives up to the hype."
""
""
""
"O-Top shelf beer. Highest level of hops are contained in Sucks before it becomes verifiably pungent like a super high ABV level Double India Pale Ale. I always forget Sucks is a DIPA. It tastes like a robust IPA. If the brew had a more creamy feel at the outset with longer lasting carbonation, and if the color of body were more distinct and uniformed, (not a toss-up of yellow/orange/gold) it would get a perfect score all across the board. But regardless, one can't name too many beers better than Sucks. Happy it's more available now due to demand."

"O - Extremely enjoyable, and ten bucks a six-pack - what a deal!"
"Overall: This has everything I love and then some in a Imperial IPA; complex and balanced with all the lovely hoppy fruitiness while being grounded with bready malt. If you haven't tried this and love rich, fruity IPAs, get this. Do not pass it up."
"O-Magically balanced and deceptive. The hops wallop you at first but then fade into an almost honey-like sweetness that surprises you. A mighty fine, unique beer."
""
""
"Overall a really good DIPA. I'd not turn this down, and I'm happy to pay for it again. But I think it's reputation precedes it a bit too much."
""
""
"Overrall this beer is ok. I do not think it lives up to the hype in any way shape or form. That said, at $10.99 for a six pack it is easily the most affordable DIPA that I am aware of. It just can't compete in the flavor or nose department with MBC Lunch, Heady Topper, or other great DIPA's."
""
"12 ounces of liquid gold poured into a Sierra Nevada pint. This full-figured, voluptuous beauty fills out her repository in ways that other beers can only imagine. A pronounced fluffy white head gives way to myriad lace patterns resembling constellations and snowflakes. Quite impressive. The nose on this one is without rival. I've smelled some really good IPAs in my day, many of which I've yet to review, but this one takes the cake. Brown sugar, grapefruit, pineapple, and tobacco leaf invade the senses and demand that you come back for more. As remarkable as it smells, it tastes just as good. Distinctively hoppy, yet equally balanced by a generous amount of citrus flavors. Despite the Imperial billing, the abv is barely detectable. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth like a nice pair of legs. Lagunitas turned what could have been an accident into, what is in my opinion, the best beer in their inventory. Like Kate Upton emerging from a pool in a curve hugging bikini, this beer arouses me in ways that are beyond words. Sucking never tasted so good."
""
""
""
"I'm a Michigan boy, so it pains me to say this, but... this is a better brew than Bell's Hopslam. I only had Hopslam this year once (on-tap), and it was GOOD, but it was harsher than I remember it being. I know this is 2% lower than Hopslam, but I really couldn't give a shit. This is THEE Imperial IPA."

"pours golden, clean. everything is balanced very well. it has a great hop bouquet. the maltiness and bitterness are balanced perfectly for the style. overall i gave it a 4.75 because there has to be something better, but this is on top for me right now."

"Pours a translucent gold color with a finger’s breadth of pure white, fluffy head. The head dissipates aver a few minutes, leaving generous gobs of lacing clinging to the glass. The arom is of resinous pine sap, freshly cut grass, some straw, and lemon and grapefruit citruses. It tastes of resinous pine, the aforementioned citrus, some grass/herbs, and some special combination of hop spices and holiday spices that I can’t seem to put my finger on. Hint of nutmeg or clove? Either way, it works well. The mouthfeel is as expected; bitter up front, lively and carbonated in the middle, and dry on the finish with the resinous nature of the hops lingering. Overall, this is a good IPA that incorporates a great hop profile with “a little something extra.” Well balanced, yet still interesting, flavorful, and exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear lighter amber with big white head that settles slowly to a quarter inch with sticky spray of lace on the glass. Smell: floral, grapefruit, melon, pine note, apricot, biscuit back. Taste: orange, pine, a little berry, citrus rind, melon, touch of apricot and biscuit. Lighter side of medium bodied... cooler, this one seemed to thin out too early, but not having that problem now. Does come off as a DIPA despite the IPA-range specs. Glad to see Sucks make it down here this year. Good, not mindblowing."
"Poured this out of a 12oz. bottle into my Maudite snifter. Gave it a nice aggressive pour that produced a solid 1” thick head that lasted for a few minutes. The lacing the beer left behind was lovely, almost as if you could see every sip you took like the rings of a tree on the edge of the glass. The smell of the beer is pretty good with a nice dank resiny sent, I do have a slightly stuffy nose myself right now so my sense is a little off. The beer is truly a delight on the palate, with a wonderful sweetness reminiscent of a dank mango fruitiness that leaves a lasting impression on the tongue well after you’ve swallowed this treat of a beverage. Now I’m a huge fan of Lagunitas and this beer has that sweetness flavor to it that you’ll find in any hop forward offering from Lagunitas. So just another great beverage from a great a great brewery."
"O- Really enjoyed this beer, and can understand why people look forward to it as a seasonal release. Would totally buy some for myself if I saw it in the Pittsburgh area. Excellent extra to receive in a trade."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle into a large snifter. Pours a perfect pale gold. Healthy amount of just off-white head that held pretty well, and faded into a medium-thin collar and a thin head that held until the glass emptied. Lacing is spotty, but pretty good. Aroma is a really interesting dance between pine and citrus hops with a nice supporting cast of a medium malt base. Though, the more I sniff, the more I pick up on the citrus over the pine. Taste is surprisingly malt centered. I get some tropical hops character in the front, that moves into more of the grapefruit, then some pine, then back to citrus; all being held up by this really great malt sweetness. Carbonation is a bit high for an IPA, but I'm kinda digging that. Body is medium to full."
""
""
"Smells and tastes the way pipe tobacco smells: fragrant, smokey, floral, peppery; tobacco leaf all the way through. Deep caramel flavors are there to balance the intense hop bomb. Back end bitterness is slightly subdued; emphasis is squarely on the forward hop flavor. Extremely drinkable with very little booziness, there's nothing that Sucks about this except the fact that it's a limited release."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sampled again, a little better than last time."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"The color isn't anything special… looks pretty yellow, like a michelob. Smells nice. Already getting a little citrus on the nose. Man, this thing tastes great. It's like lemon cake with a bite… A pilsner style bitterness on the finish. Nice hop balance. Fine carbonation really buzzes in the mouth. Exceptional beer."
""
"O: A very nice strong ale. Great afternoon beer and good with food. This substitute might be better than the 'teacher'."
""
"Poured into a tulip glass, and it has a golden orange color with a lively head. The foam sticks nicely to the glass as it's drunk. The smell is a spicy citrus. It has a lighter mouthfeel than most DIPAs I've had, but the hops pack quite a punch as your taste buds become overwhelmed by a grapefruity bitterness, in a good way (it's smooth, not harsh). The grapefruity taste lingers in the mouth. Very nice for its style, it's almost light and crisp for a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you love a bold IPAs, try Sucks. I truly believe it will become your go-to IPA."
"poured this into a tulip; dense bright head, long lasting. the aroma is floral with sugar coated pineapples peaches and tangerines. the initial taste overwhelms, there's a lot of hops, but its artistic. there are subtle complexities; lemon/lime and some sweeter citrus, mango, grapefruit, and the hops just stay under the level of harsh"
""
""
"Very dank and lemony with enough malt backbone to hold its own. Not exactly how I remember it but still an excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a dark yellow in color with a two finger white head with great retention and some nice lacing. Smell is nice tropical pineapple, guava, orange, etc with a sweet smell from the hops. Taste is a little more malty that I expected but it works good and provides great balance. Of course everything I found in the nose was in the taste as well. Really tastes nice. Mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style which is nice. Great carbonation here. Overall the beer is great and surpassed my expectations. Gonna be seeking this out more often."
""
"I think the past reviews have done a great job describing this beer. The thing I want to say is that this beer made me sign up for beeradvocate. I am a Lagunitas fan and love the bitter IPAs. But this beer is special. Its clear appearance is in contrast with its wonderful bold fragrance, and full, complex flavor. This is one of the most enjoyable beers I've experienced in a long time, I love it. If I could, I might marry it. Or at least get engaged... for a while. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."
""
""
"overall: This beer really did not deliver what the hype seemed to promise. Its not that its bad. Not at all...but its not that amazing. I kinda peg it on the same level as something like X2IPA. I felt that beers like hop ranch and dirtwolf really blow this one out of the water. Saying that, this is suppose to be different from those two above, and for what it is, its very nice. Drinkable, but still quite resinous\hoppy, I give this one a 4.25\5"

"Poured a yellowish, orangelike gold with one finger head that died slow with lace everywhere. Typical Stone aroma of just heavyhanded hops, mostly citric although some grape and even possible tropical get in there (there seems to be some light, airy fruity sweetness poking around). Taste is basically the same with lots of piney, earthiness, citric, some grape and again this tropical fruit sensation (at this point I'd say pineapple, mango, apricot - just a sweeter fruit). Great balance as the small amount of bready malt and possible caramel malt help keep the beer from being too hoppy and it finishes so crisp and clean. A unique DIPA that is well balanced and a must try."
""
""
"I know you beer snobs look down on those who age IPAs, but I'm going to age this one, along with every other IPA i've had. I'll tell you what, if you love beers, specifically IPAs, you would do the same. Not necessarily because you're looking to improve the beer, but because you are trying to deconstruct it in a way. Remove some of the hops that delightfully highlight the beer, and focus on the underlying tones that supplement those fresh hops. When I tried heady topper with a year of age, it honestly tasted so much better without the distraction of the intense bitterness on a 2 day-old batch. I say, if it has at least 8% abv, age it regardless of what class beer it is."

"Pours a golden orange with an average size, bright white head. Good retention and lacing. Lots of tropical fruit on the nose with a hint of grassiness.

Overall, this is an extremely well crafted DIPA that deserves it's place on the Beers of Fame list!"

"Sucks is a fantastic IPA. Aroma and taste are both dominated by tropical fruits and sweetness. The malt backbone is there but it definitely takes a back seat to the hops, which is what I prefer in IPAs. Given the availability and price this is hard to beat. Sure, Heady is probably better, but this is on the shelves all over the country, and it certainly trumps anything else with that sort of distribution. I have gone through 3 6-packs in the last few weeks alone; highly recommended."

"It is about the only beer I do not mind drinking over and over and over; it is just damn near perfect."

"This hit my expectations. The best brew from laggy I've had. the aroma on this sets it apart from the other ipa/dipas I've had. The citrus is crazy on this but I think it needs a tiny bit of balance to get this near perfect. But for hop heads, this is a wet dream."
"O- Consistently Excellent. Ibu 63. Could easily sit down and drink a couple of these."

"O: This reminds me of the Pliny I reviewed earlier this month, and dare I say, I think it's better? I've heard rumblings that this year's batch of Sucks doesn't hold up against last year's. Having only had 1 last year, I can't speak to that, but regardless...This beer is absolutely perfect. I may only have a few reviews under my belt, and may be a rookie in terms of the craft beer scene, but I know a terrific beer when I taste one, and this beer is just that. Big ups, Sucks."

"BOD 339/13. Golden pour with a nice head and lasting lacing. Very nice nose of grapefruit and other citrus against a slight spruce essence. Almost medium bodied with an average carbonation. The mouthfeel is almost creamy. An outstanding hop flavor with grapefruit the most forward. Spruce and a slight malt sweetness round out this well balanced ale. The alcohol content is totally hidden by the flavor. The finish is more smooth than crisp with a nice tartness and a soft bitterness. This is one of the best."

"Outstanding DIPA. Has a really floral/melon-ish flavor to it; fairly significant resiny hop flavor, though not as intense as Surly Abrasive (which is my favorite beer in the category). Would absolutely continue to buy, at this price point. Stoked that Lagunitas continues to make such accessible, affordable beers."
""
"Had the most recent version on tap 1/13/14. Not as bright as I remembered, with a thicker body, but still retains that delicious Lagunitas-hop smell. Reminded me a lot of a fresher Hop Stoopid. Will be curious to see if the bottle release is any different - hoping they make enough that I don't struggle too hard to find some!"
""
"I'm a sucker for citrusy piney IPAs and this was one of the best all around I've had. It was a beautiful orange amber clear pour with a thick white frothy head. Crystal clear with just the slightest sediment. No haze and more Pliny than heady. The aroma was one of the best I've smelled. Pineapple orange citrus with a piney balance that had my nose buried. I crave this beers smell. The taste hit all the citrus and pine. Very good only slightly less refined than say Pliny but better than average no doubt. The bitterness was good not overpowering but late on the palette it was more noticed than others. This beer overall is one of my favorites and was very good. Already craving another."
""
"Comparables: Oskar Blues Deviant Dale's, Hop Stoopid, Ruination"
"Poured a nice clear yellow-golden color, with two fingers of fluffy head that settled to a nice lace. The smell is amazing, with big tropical and citrus aromas, along with some bready notes. The taste is equally big, with mango, grapefruit, a little piney flavor, and some bready malty bits. I also get a little onion flavor, but in a good way. The mouthfeel is outstanding, with a nice medium body that just rolls around the palate. Carbonation was nice, not prickly. Overall this is just an outstanding beer, glad that Lagunitas has made this a year-round release."
"O: Great nose on the beer followed by a unique mouthfeel and a taste that doesn't disappoint. Its all I look for in an IPA, but is it something I would blow the doors off for? Not really. But just because there are a ton of great IPAs out there."
""
""
""
"O- One of the best IPA's out. Nothing sucks about this. Get and drink as much as you can!!!"
"From: 2014-11-07 This batch isn't as dank as the batch from last January and I'm enjoying it more.  There's still plenty of hop flavor; no doubt.  It may be a touch sweeter too, which helps emphasize the fruit flavor.  I'm digging the quart bottle for sure!  Flashback to a time when it was common to buy beer (70's) in quarts.  This is ever-so-much better in the quart format than anything I was having then except; for Ballantine IPA into 1972.  That was good stuff too."
""
""
"Overall (4.25): Lagunitas Sucks is a very good Imperial IPA–it tends towards the resinous/sticky/sweet/fruity route rather than the dry and uber-grapefruity route. I don't have a preference either way; what I can say is that it Lagunitas has executed this kind of Imperial IPA quite well. The only thing that needs to improve is the carbonation level. That's not a huge issue, but it does rob the beer of some of its potential. Still, a very, very tasty beer. Recommended for all those hop heads out there!"

"Sucks is one of, if not the best, beer I have had from an all around solid brewery. The canvas of toast and caramel really allows the citrus hoppiness to shine. I'll be picking this up in the future for sure."

"Deep golden colored with vibrant carbonation and Brussels lacing. Quarter inch head of tightly knit white head. Excellent clarity. Nose is filled with pungent freshly picked grapefruit like hop aroma. I get just a whiff of that cereal grain mixture. The mouth seems weighted,dry,and sticky from the hops. I would describe the taste as a great blend of bitter citrus hops mixed with sweet and slightly nutty cereal grains. Like honey but Cheerios meets west coast IPA."

"A bold DIPA, aroma is a real winner with the herbal vs. tropical war that captivates the nose. Big flavor, heavy hitting with good balance, malt provides enough sweetness but the hop flavors swing more towards the funky herbaceous side rather than citrus or tropical as I would have hoped. Overall, a complete beer for the senses."

"Overall, I was very impressed with the beer. It's a classic west coast style IPA."

"This is everything a great IPA should be. From the golden pour to pine needle and grapefruit aroma, this beer delivers the goods. It is very hop forward but still remains relatively well balanced. It is bitter and bitey but not so much the one couldn't session this ale. Mighty tasty and mighty refreshing. Will look forward to this each winter. Thanks for another winner Lagunitas."
"Mouthfeel is very good. Good carbonation level. Gritty with a strong dry bitter finish. Sort of earthy at the end. Still like everything I've had from Lagunitas, it's extremely drinkable. Another great brew from a great brewery. I usually prefer a little more balance to my IPAs, but this is a perfect beer if you're in the mood for a hop bomb. Nice job Laguniats."
""
""
"Overall impression: A classic, big West Coast IPA. Seems to light (in flavor and body) to be """Double""" but it doesn't matter. It's delicious and worthy of the hype."
""
"Overall, I prefer my DIPAs a bit bigger in body, with a little more malt sweetness. That said, the juicy hop smack this beer is able to achieve is remarkable. Also one of the best smelling beers I've ever had."
""

"Pours out a hazy brass with a thin head. Smell is redolent of funky, b.o.-y, oniony, citrusy, and piney hops. Flavor is totally hop-forwarded, but not overly bitter. A bit sweet, which slightly turns me off. Tons of sticky hop funk in the flavor throughout. More citrus than in the nose. Mouthfeel is sticky, but the carbonation helps to scrape it off the tongue. Deliciously and massively hoppy. I'd like a little less sweetness, though."
""
"A great beer- I'm so glad that they decided to brew this again. I really think this is my favorite of all of their brews. As much as I like Lagunitas, I think many of their beers have a house style that makes them taste too similar to one another. Not this one. It's a breath of fresh air, with a flat out stank to it and lovely citrusy aromas and flavors- lime and tangerine with some herbs and some light fresh malt flavors that serve as a pedestal for the hops. Fresh tasting and not heavy on the palate, but with a satisfying finish with a touch of honeyed sweetness that complements the hops. A lovely beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: awesome DIPA and worth a buy"
""
"O - This beer lives up to the hype. It's one of the best """shelf""" beers out there!"
""
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, lots of active carbonation, and finishes pretty clean for a DIPA. Overall, this is a great DIPA when fresh. Learned my lesson last time, check bottle dates and don't let it sit. The citrus and tropical fruits are wonderful, and the lack of stickiness is different, but great. The smell is really the strong point here, and keeps drawing me back in."

"Owing to the lower alcohol content, this is far less of an undertaking than OTWOA. It is closer in alcohol content to Hop Stoopid. Comparing those two, this is similar in appearance, but the aroma and taste are more powerful. That's a good thing. Yet the """drinkability""" on this is through the roof. One of the few beers I'd drink more than one of in a night."
""
"Overall very enjoyable good beer, nose is wonderful tropical fruit market the taste is almost as good. Little bit different then most IPA's much more fruity with out being overly bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this one is a classic IPA that meets and beats the hype. Very tasty, I'd love to drink this until I got sick of it."

""
""
"O-I was surprised with this DIPA wished that I tried it sooner. Great price for $10!"
""
"overall; my scoring says it all, to me this is an IPA, so i don't really get how its connected to brown shugga, but with the strong fruit which is so beautifully balanced by hops, this beer is very drinkable, satisfying but not strong, and an overall wonderful experience without making you feel weighed down."
""
"Great play on a beer that seems to have a balanced sweet note with the malt and hops. Think it's an easy drinking beer that goes down easily. Big fan!"
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"I was skeptical, but i'm sold. This is damn good. The smell is a little weak, nothing pronounced or obvious, subtle hints of fruit maybe a touch of juniper, thankfully no spice. Taste is solid, easy-to-drink double-ish goodness. Can't put a finger on what it reminds me of? Color is surprisingly light, almost domestic-lager kind-of-light. I've heard this is going year round, if so i'm in. Lagunitas has never had a daily-drinker for me, but this is just what i needed. Cheers."
"O- I'm always guarded when I drink something with a lot of hype. Even so, this threw me for a loop. Its a pretty good beer, but its lighter on the tongue, and in flavor, than most IPAs I can get at my local grocery store. I'll finish off my 32 ounces, but I'm pretty sure I won't be in a hurry to have this again anythime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Reminds me of Odell IPA. Very effervescent, like hop candy"
""
""
""
"O: Very good brew. This beer has changed my perspective on the IPA style. It seems as though Lagunitas stepped up their game on this one and made a very refreshing, well-balanced, tasty IPA."
""
"Clear gold color, white sticky head. Lace is patchy and stringy. Has that oily hoppy look to it. Aroma is loaded with stinky, dank, fruit. Sweet sugar cookies, mouth watering citrus, pineapple, lemon, all sorts of tropical. Flavor is loaded with sweet, bright, happy citrus, pine, and leaves. Very nice creamy, slick, lightly syrupy texture.This beer is always excellent when i have it."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
"Postscript: Bought 2 more 6-packs. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a solid beer. If I hadn't had the Pliny side by side it would probably get a higher rating, but still a good beer. I will probably come back in a few days and maybe update after I've only had this one. Anyhow, I recommend and I will certainly enjoy the rest of my six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm glad I finally got to try this beer about which I've heard so much. While it didn't completely live up to its huge amount of hype, it was still fantastic. The tropical fruitiness was superb and it was well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Yes, this is a fantastic IIPA. Given the price at $9/6 I look forward to this beer in the dead of winter every year. If only this was offered year round and in cans..."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle into a tulip. Pours a medium orange that is pretty transparent. Good head retention. The nose is grapefruit, lemon, mango, pine. This is a pure citrus bomb. The taste is strong citrus fruit with the grapefruit and lemon really shining through. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Overall this beer is a brilliant citrus IPA that packs a silent punch with the ABV. My favorite Lagunitas IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer itself is fairly light to medium-bodied with a ton of carbonation. The taste, like the smell, is all grapefruit, pine, and hops. The hops are pretty intense but there is no bitterness until the aftertaste. Lagunitas Sucks is a superior DIPA and it pretty much lives up to the hype (although I still think that their Day Time IPA is slightly better and generally their crowning achievement)."
""
""
""
""

"An excellent beer for hops lovers. Juicy in inviting. A smile in a bottle - with hops."
"O: a damn good beer, one of my favs, sells out quickly in my area but i try to get a case or so so i can enjoy it for a while, unbelievable value at around 10 bucks a 6 pack, do yourself a favor and get your hands on this"

"Altogether, I haven't reviewed Brown Shugga yet, but this does stand up to the bit of Brown Shugga I had in quality. Personally I enjoyed Brown Shugga a bit more but that is just my tastes. This is really fantastic and a very good hoppy ale. I was pleasantly surprised and am glad to say I have one more bottle of it. Don't pass it up! Try it out!"

"O- Limited addition IPA hype is no joke....hop heads might be pissed because of the lower IBU's around the 60 mark....but if you are about balance, flavor, and getting excited about a beer...and ohh yeah I forgot it has 7.85 abv that can't be explained because it does'nt show up... Be happy you just paid $10 for this six pack"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink. The 7.85 ABV is hard to believe, it's so smooth. The 63 IBU, however, seems accurate. Almost no bitterness until very late; mostly yeast and a malty sweetness. Doesn't taste like an IPA, much less a DIPA. Reminiscent of Little Sumpin Wild with its Belgian yeast flavor. Not bad, but I much prefer Hop Stoopid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Buy this if you can find it. Its one of the best IPAs I've had and its an amazing value."
""
"You can taste the quality of this beer and it drinks pretty damn nice for +7% ABV beer. I could drop a few of these in one session no problem. Its got that real floral Lagunitas hop taste that is present in most of their beers . This beer in my opinion is better then Brown Shugga simply b/c its much easier to enjoy and the alcohol doesn't kill you, but to each his own I guess. I wish I had a Sumthin Sumthin that I should compare side by side b/c I think this is closer to that beer in taste, mouthfeel, and appearance then any of the other Lagunitas brews. If you like D/IPA give it a shot."
"I don't know if Sucks is really as worthy as the hype implies, but it's certainly a very, very good beer."

"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip Glass. 12/18/13."
""
"Retrying this with a bottle I know is fresh. Pours golden and clear with a giant fluffy white head. Off the bat there is significantly more cat pee, pine, lemon peel, and huge florals than last time. Flavor is a mouthfeel of fresh hops, medium bitter, with honey, pine, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, and some sweet malts in the background. What a night and day difference! Medium slick mouthfeel with medium or a little less carbonation. A really nice brew that I could have again for sure. Maybe a step or two below my favorites but still very nice. Only complaint is that I would like a bit more carb. Glad I retried this one. Deleted the other rating because I think it might have been a really old bottle. Shit happens. This is good."

"O: The first time I had this on tap, I was amazed. Now after having it in the bottle, I think that the people at Lagunitas are dabblers in the black magic of Alchemy. Awesome beer from first sip to last sip. Hug aromas and flavors without wrecking your palate. Among my top 5 beers ever. Believe the hype!"

"Poured into a pint glass: a light amber with thick white head that fades into fine lacing and a thin top layer. Wonderful hop citric aroma and flavor that is characteristic of Lagunitas brews followed by a slightly syrupy and numbing (from the hops) mouth-feel that compels one to drink more and more. The hops, of course, are the focus, but they are supported and wonderfully balanced by a medium/light malt/sweet backbone that makes the drinkability excellent. It is light, crisp, and perfectly hoppy. In my opinion, far better than brown sugga."
""
""
"I like pretty much every Lagunitas beer, but this is my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing says Lagunitas like a) making hoppy beers and b) bucking trends. Sucks accomplishes both with it's powerful hop aroma and flavor, straying quite far from the usual winter warmers released around the same time. This tropical, citrusy double IPA is a look forwards to spring and summer as it finishes crisp, clean, and damn drinkable - it's a quenching double IPA, not a barleywine-like monster. I don't think anyone will blame Lagunitas for sucking unless they stop making this delicious beer."

"This beer was big grapefruit hops from the moment I opened the bottle. It had a very strong aroma and the initial taste was all grapefruit. This is what I have come to expect from Lagunitas. As the Holiday Ale warmed I could taste a nice malty backbone that helped balance out the strong hops. The beer leaves a good lingering bitterness on the palate and the flavor kept me coming back. This was another great beer from Lagunitas."
"O - This has to be the best value DIPA out there. Insanely good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I had a half pint of this stuff earlier in the year in a flight and it was the only one that stuck out and wowed me. When it came out this time I ran right out and grabbed a 6er to consume as fresh as possible. Holy hell! I love this tropical bomb of a beer. It's almost hard to drink because then it will go away and I won't be able to smell it. An instant favorite and something every type of beer drinker should taste or at least smell!"

"355mL thanks to tastybeer. A clear golden pour with a larger, off-white rocky head. Nose is just $&@# insane! Smells like I was awoken from a stupor in a British Columbia marijuana farm. Dank hops explosion. Holy crap. Mild notes of pale malt, wheat, oatmeal, jackfruit melon, and candied orange peel come through. Insane dry hop character. Taste is not too sticky, fresh, well balanced, mild alcohol spice. Palate is very soft and silky and small saltwater quenching. Mild piney hop character. I can’t believe it- Lagunitas best beer by a mile. Makes Hop Stoopid look a little stoopid. Why this is called a """holiday ale""" is beyond me but this is on another level from Brown Shugga. Actually on another level from Lagunitas. How did this happen? I would seriously consider this beer as a DIPA of choice over Pliny the Elder. This is a DIPA masterpiece. 9/4/8/4/17=4.2"

"Lagunitas Sucks Brown Shuggga Substitute Ale pours a dark golden color, with a small lacing head. There is a wet floral aroma, with roasted malts coming through. The taste is rather balanced, with nice floral notes coming through, all mixed in with a roasted malty taste. Nice full flavors, has a """wet""" bitterness, and rather balanced. Overall its a balanced and easy drinking double IPA."

"Great hop aroma. Generous head. Above average mouthfeel. Good malt backing, caramel, a bit of fruit. Nicely carbonated. Nicely drinkable. superior IPA just the right amount of bitterness. Recent bottle from Premier Gourmet. I could have a four pack in the fridge of this."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pint glass, nice golden peach color with a small half finger head. Aroma was piney with some hints of pit fruit such as apricot, taste followed with a nice hop tang coating the tongue and some pit fruit sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel with some bitter notes and a refreshing finish, overall a very nice brew that I would pick up again"

"Pours a near clear amber with a couple fingers of white/off-white head and great retention. Has a bit of a haze to it. Smell is hoppy with mostly citrus hops, but also some floral. Good amount of malt in the background as well, pale, caramel and a hint of spicy rye. Taste follows with mostly hops, citrus, floral some pine. Maltiness is here too, with the rye playing a slightly more pronounced role. Nice complexity. Mouthfeel is bitter with a bit of spiciness, not the beer's strong point. Overall a great beer, but I've had better, not as excited as some of the reviewers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Once again, this is the best smelling IPA/DIPA I have ever had the opportunity to smell, and it tasted great, but it just did not quite live up to the smell. Still a high quality brew from a great brewery."

"Well..."""Sucks""" doesn't suck. I'm sure I'm about the millionth person saying that, but I had to. It's gold in color and piney/hoppy at the same time. The things you want to find in a beer like this. This is an easily affordable, easy to find Double/Imperial IPA. You don't need to trade your first born to get this beer."
""
"Overall - A great beer yet again from Lagunitas...I love nearly everything I've had from their line-up. I'm a fan and you will be too...this is one of the best IPAs/DIPAs in the WORLD! Get some! Cheers!"

"O: Look, this is a fantastic DIPA. I cant imagine anyone not enjoying this beer. Its the pinacle of a hop head's dream. I dont think this beer gets the fan fare it deserves. I'd put it on par with Pliny or Heady topper any day of the week."
"O: Great beer. I'll definitely buy this again. This is a fridge staple while it's available. Very refreshing and drinkable."

"A big west coast style hops taste and I like it."
""
"Poured into the trusty pint glass. nice brownish golden color to it more like a brown sugar color. Nice lacing not to thin and not to thick. Smells like heaven and tastes very smooth for an Imperial IPA. Not a strong after taste but a well worth tasting beer. Mouth of addicting flavor and overall irresistable beer. Two thumbs for this beer"
""

"O - A good beer in it's own right but I'm a bit disappointed with this one. With all the hype it gets I was expecting more. Nothing really stood out to me just a solid all around beer."

"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is excellent. It has a killer hop scent surrounded by a solid pale malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a wonderful hop flavor; bold and full of citrus notes. The malt bill provides adequate balance and a smooth pale and Munich malt flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a delicious DIPA. It's true to the West coast style and highly drinkable."
"Pours a five plus finger white head that fades slowly leaving tons of lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is hemlock/pine hops, flavor is caramel and hemlock. Light lingering bitter finish. Decent Imperial IPA. $2.45 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
""
"Tropical citrus smell and taste that is incredibly refreshing. Must say this is the best smelling beer I've ever had. Taste is almost as good as the smell. Being on the east coast I can't find this often, if I do come across it again I will not hesitate to buy it."

"The body was very much on the thin side of average, if it were any thinner, I would knocked some more points off. Drinkability was OK, fairly typical for style, although at below 8%abv, is this really an Imperial IPA? The low alcohol made drinking easier, but hurt the beers chances of of matching expectations. Overall, a nice enough little beer, one worth trying, but not one that matches the hype that has been thrust upon it."
""
""
""
""

"I think I bought into the hype. Some kind of substitute was supposed to be in place of brown sugar. Pardon me for not noticing the subtlety in this west-coast hop party, which still dominates the initial taste. The sweetness, if any comes out later. It is arguable if this be deserves a """premium""" rating like it has been given. Lagunitas has superior brews than this if you are willing to look around."
""
"O - This is probably the best beer I have ever had, the more I have it the better it gets. Pick this up if you see it! Also the price is great, $8.99 for a 6 pack. Cant beat that for a beer of this quality!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is great, really drinkable and cost friendly! This is one of my """go to""" beers for sure. Lagunitas definitely doesn't Suck!"
""
""
"Pours a clear gold with 2-finger head, impressive lacing, pretty carbonation. The smell has a very aromatic quality to it, lots of pine but also a kind of floral quality. It tastes awesome--dominated by pine, but with a solid malt backbone and a real brightness from grapefruit, mango, citrus. Finishes somewhat bitter but clean. It also has a very light mouthfeel for something of this hoppiness which I'm really digging. Keep it around--I'm sad that it's going to go away!"
""
""
""

""
"A-"
""
""
""

"O - overal to be blunt, hands down better than Maximus and should replace it in their year round lineup. I don't care if it's been brewed since 96, this is a better DIPA and I want more. top of my list of DIPAs so far."

"Hop heads, get it!"

"Wish this was a little more balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Words can't describe what I think of this beer. It is one of the best beers I have ever drunk - period. The hops flavour is amazing with a really floral interesting tint and the way it leaves your pallet clean afterwards is superb. No lingering bitterness. I also find it far lighter than a lot of DIPAs and certainly light for the ABV. Better than any east coast IPA i've tried. I can't stop drinking it. Very very good. I would recommend anyone reading this to go and buy some immediately. The other great thing about it is the price. Cheaper than nearly all the other double IPAs around. Fantastic beer. I think I've said enough!"

"O - Excellent. Love the Brown Shugga sweetness which is balanced very nicely by 68 IBUs. Booze is low but enough to taste. Froth level is the perfect amount you want for a IIPA, head also remains for entire brew. Highly recommend this to even non IPA lovers. Its certainly worth the $11.99/ 6 pack."
""
"The taste is where this beer excels. Wonderful hops whomping my palate then leaves it clean. Appropriate mouthfeel for the style; a great beer."
""
""
""
"Appearance- gold bottle pour with nice head retention and lacing sticks. Smell- sweet pine and hops are very prevalent- slight caramel. Taste- great hops up front- the dry hopping is great. Mouthfeel- lingering and slight carbonation. Overall- one of my fav IPAs. I've tasted literally thousands of beers in the past few years- and this is my first rating as I sit here- so hopefully I get better at this."

"I just bought a 6 pack of this at Trader Joe's for like 6.99! Love it. Love it. Love it. Everything from Lagunitas is fantastic and this is no exception. True to their style, the brewery character shines through in this Brown Shugga. It's like a big ol' red ale with the signature blend of hops and malt character. I still can't believe that I paid 6.99 at TJs and this is on the Top 250. I'll have to do some ISO:FTs."

"Overall, quite good indeed, but not the powerhouse that I was expecting based on the reviews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious DIPA with spices, caramels, tropical fruits and pine notes. Long lasting bitterness with a super fresh hoppiness make this a great brew. Balanced with great body. Hopheads unite on this one. Overall amazing and could drink this bad boy all the time!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brownish yellow color - somewhat deep hue but could be deceiving. Solid head and lively - carbonation continues from the bottom of the glass a long while after pour and maintains a nice thin layer of head on top of the beer even 30 minutes later. Smell is hoppy yet sweet - strong pine, grass and brown sugar - the aroma is really a treat. Taste doesn't disappoint - really solid and would like to see this one brewed regularly. Grassy bitter hops up front - maybe a tad of spice but then finishes with brown sugar sweetness. Really nicely balanced and really accentuates the hops when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly an above average imperial IPA. Great smell, great flavor, exceptional body. Hard to find fault with anything here. Easily one of the better IPAs, imperial or otherwise, I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was glad this one lived up to the hype, at least for me. Almost a perfect brew. Maybe it is a perfect brew, I'm just afraid to say so with so little under my belt. I'll keep picking this one up. I also love the balance of hops/sweet. It works very well here. I would like to see a """bottled on""" date or something. The sixer I got revealed nothing about when this was bottled, or a freshness date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the complexity in the grains and the dry hopped goodness are it's best flavor characteristics. I would suggest this if you like to try different IPAs, or if you are the type that loves the heaviest hop flavors possible!"
""
""
""
"O: A very good offering from Lagunitas. Unlike some other DIPAs, “Sucks” has a nice balance of huge hop flavors and malts. Although I’m not a huge hophead, I enjoyed this brew and will definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is awesome. It is everything the style should be! If it was only a bit more unfiltered, I would say I like it as much as the monster players in the style: Panzer Wolf, Heady, Dreadnaught, etc. This could very well be my """go to""" based on availability, price, and quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Contrary to the title of this IPA, it is top-notch and Lagunitas does not suck at all, especially since this has year-round availability. Glad this was my first Lagunitas beer, and it would seem that they know their way around IPAs. I will definitely be getting this again. Sucks is a must try for anyone that says they like IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has a nice full bright hop flavor but it is very drinkable for such a big flavor. There is a nice depth to the hops that makes each sip interesting."
""
"I poured this into a tulip glass, it has a lite reddish color body with a thin white head that hangs around for a while. The smell has a very appealing nose of piney, and citrus hops. The taste pops of bitter, with some pine and citrus hopness. It has a great mouth feel and leaves a nice hop aftertaste on the tongue. Overall this is a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"The smell is possibly the strongest asset of this brew, I immediately noted alcoholic piney notes with some citrusy tangerine in the background followed up by musky undertones. The initial taste was quite pleasing, replete with piney, lemon/orangetastes and plenty of well balanced piney and citrusy hops. The first three seconds on the pallet is great, packing great amounts of flavor into a well balanced sweet, resinous, and citrusy punch. The only issue I had with the brew was in the aftertaste- slightly more sweet than I like in my IPAs- maybe amplified by the yeast? Overall mouthfeel was good, fairly crisp and carbonation is there while it finished nicely. Certainly could taste the booze towards the end of the bottle- but I was skiing so WTF it made for a great few runs off of paradise. Overall a well balanced IPA that exemplifies piney resin but a bit too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Well, it's not what I'd consider a """Brown Shugga Substitute", but it's definitely not bad either. Succeeds at the often attempted but usually missed moderate-IBU citric DIPA a'la Nugget Nectar."
""
""
""
""
"Super hyped. Super good. Even better fresher. Best DIPA? Nah. But really really really good one? yup."
"one of the most hyped beers on the forums here, and in the top 100, so needless to say, I was stoked to find this on the shelf. the pour is a lovely honey color, pretty much clear, with a lot of rising carbonation and a two inch white head with excellent retention. the nose is that sweeter, more oily hop that lagunitas is so good at getting into their beers. sweeter malt base as well. the flavor is good, fresh hops on the pine end of the spectrum, but the sugar is more than I like in my india pale ales. decent bitterness in the finish, but the residual sugar is close to overwhelming. also, does lagunitas use the same friggen yeast in every one of the beers they make? to me its such a detractor now, it doesn't belong in half the beers, and its boring me here. good feel though, medium body and fine carbonation. its a damn good ipa, but it gets a little alcohol heavy as it warms up, which exacerbates the sugar and the same old yeast they always use. to me, its good, but way overhyped. just my opinion, so don't crucify me, but a new yeast would do this brewery and this beer wonders."
""
"Another amazing creation from Lagunitas. This brewery is another one that can do no wrong. Almost overpowering is the double imperial IPA that also """SUCKS""" come winter time. The colder the weather, the better this beer tastes. Pucker up.!"
""
"O/D - A very good DIPA. If you love the piney resin almost fresh hop style, this is your beer. Not overly filling and a very workable ABV."
""
""
""
"D - A rock solid American DIPA... Loaded with depth, complexity and character... It's not the hoppiest, but it's bursting with flavor... There's also something that makes it rather unique in the realm of hyped hop bombs, though I can't quite place my finger on it... I highly recommend and will gladly indulge whenever presented the opportunity..."
""
""
"Pours a clear, slightly orange-y straw color, very clear, pretty small head. The smell is classic hoppy American ipa; citrus, a bi of tropical fruit, a bit of pine...it's not overwhelming, but very nice! Taste is excellent, hoppy, a reasonable amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is very nice. Overall, it's just a really solid American IPA. I'll be having this one again, when I can find it."
""
"There is nothing like a bright glow of golden honey color as the evening sun peers through the glass. Heavy hints of grapefruit along with freshly soaked pine, creamy feel as it splashes the palate. Very enjoyable brew on a warm sunny day here in the desert. Time to set the carne asada on the grill and quaff a second one."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: great DIPA that's lighter in alcohol than most with an absolutely amazing aroma. Has a grapefruit juice like quality without the acidity."
""
""
"Pours a burnt orange with a frothy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is sweet and juicy; some nice hop resin, citrus, brown sugar and some bread. A sweet and fruity IPA; sweet citric juice, hop resins, and some bread. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, I get the hype for this beer but I am not quite digging this like most. Would drink again, but wont be seeking this out personally. Kinda reminds me a lot of Brown Shugga, just with a different malt base."
""
""
""
"Overall: A super tasty beer that I would definitely indulge in again. It’s very well-rounded and drinkable. Lagunitas generally produces quality brews so no surprise here!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I never thought I would enjoy an DIPA this much, especially with the lack of a malt backbone. The hops are not overbearing at all and it's just sweet perfection. This is on a level of heady topper, and is simply phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd definitely buy this one every year if I had access to it. As I have to trade for it, this may be my only encounter with it. I can confirm that it was a delightful one at that."
"Serving Type- 12oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. Thanks for reading."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
""
"O - Its a very nice offering, I do prefer Sumpin Sumpin to this one though."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear amber into a tulip with a generous white foamy head. Aroma is absolutely intoxicating citrus and pine and easily one of the best noses on an IPA/IIPA. Taste is tropical fruits, hops, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, lemon zest, and balanced by subtle malt. Sticky, smooth, crisp, and balanced mouthfeel. Quite possibly the best bang for your buck at 9 bucks a sixer; packs a very high flavor to dollar ratio. A great go-to beer, especially now that it figures to be a year round offering. The best of many Lagunitas IPA offerings."
""
""
""
""
"O - Picked up 2 (6) packs and upon my first taste I didn't think it was worth the hype. After my second beer I'm hooked! Need more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I found 2013's Hopslam to be off from year's past, and luckily discovered Sucks just in time to fill the gap. One of the best DIPA's I've had in a long time. Haven't had many Lagunitas, but this beer converted me."
""
"Overall a really good double ipa. It's pretty much what I expected given the name and my familiarity with lagunitas."
"This beats the piss outta Brown Sugga."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is awesome. I have not had much exposure to lagunitas in the past. WIth my recent tastings of several of their beers, this is by far my favorite. Though it doesn't come out and call itself one, this is an awesome imperal or double IPA. This may be close to the top of this category for me. Watch out Bells Hopslam and Breckenridge 471 Small Batch!"
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this brew to be sure, and I'm happy to have the better part of a six pack left to hold on to and explore a bit more. I can't say that I'm blown away by it, however; it feels a bit off balance - drier and more bitter than I think I'd like, but it's a fine beer nevertheless. Not something I would go that far out of my way to get again, which considering how infrequently I get my hands on American craft brews, is a decision I have to make."

"Best beer that I've had in a long time. I was expecting something much heavier from Lagunitas at 7.8%. Great hop aros woma and hop burst. Very well balanced. Not overly bitter as you'd expect from 63 IBUs. Great beer. Lagunitas sucks for not making this beer year round."

"A well done DIPA. Drinks enjoyably from top to bottom."

"O: This is an excellent DIPA. It's very easy to drain a glass of this. The fruit smells and flavors are fabulous. There's also a great background story behind this beer along with it's hilarous name. Buy extra if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely drinkable, especially since the bitterness is subdued compared to other beers in the style and no traces of alcohol are present in the taste. It's packed with so many flavors of mangoes and citrus that I feel like I am getting 100 percent of my recommended daily allowance of vitamin C."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well if Lagunitas sucks I don't need awesome, really though this is a great brew and I'm very stoked I can buy this here in Alberta and will be buying it again soon"
""
""
""
"Brothers: Are you kidding me? There's a 9 point difference between you and us and you're on the wrong side of history. SUCKS is amazing. And factoring in the very reasonable price and the fact that it can ACTUALLY BE FOUND on shelves, it's one of the best. The nose: 5. Taste 5. For hopheads, the battle is between Enjoy By and Sucks. And I'm from the Midwest. California: we give up!! You win. (Hate to say it.)"
""
""
""
""
""

"I had one of these the other day and the flavor had really fallen off. I was worried about the remainder of the sixer, but the one I'm drinking new is beautiful. An excellent west coast ipa."

"Poured from short 12oz bottle into mug. Clear golden yellow with visible carbonation, thick foamy white head that came up a lot more than I expected, even with a pretty tame pour. Leaves bubbly lacing all over the glass as it's drunk. Smell is sweet fruit at first, sort of mango or pineapple, then hoppy at the end. Almost smells gin-like. Taste follows suit exactly; sweet and smooth up front, then hoppy and bitter at the end. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, odd for the style, but probably from the extra sweetness. Overall, this is quite different from your average DIPA, but it's delicious."
""
"O- This was a decent IPA, but with so many good IPAs out there it is hard to rate this one that highly. Overall I think it is definitely overrated, but very good for the price. Personally I think there are a few better IPAs you can pick up a four pack or six pack of, but not many that you can get for $2/bottle."

" This beer I think is just as good bottled as it was on tap fresh last year when I lived in CA. This beer is the shit. The best bang for your buck among ANY DIPA."
"Overall-This is a great beer! Very compatible to hopslam and some of the other big DIPA's out there. Priceline this has just about every beer on the planet beat, I got it for $9.99 a sixer. That's insanely cheap for this beer. I hope this becomes a year round brew because I need more of it, immediately. Dangerously easy to drink, abv at 7.85% is surprising, this thing will sneak up on you. 4.75"

This is a unique ipa that has the dank cannabaceae hop flavor that an India pale ale should. I am an ipa lover and this combines hop flavor with a smooth malty spine. The finish is succulent with a bitter tinge. smooth and sweet like the legs of a tight young vavachka. Highly recommend to any ipa lover. This would go good with a fat spliff of sensimilla."
"I could probably drink a 6 pack of these one right after the other."

"Overall: For an imperial IPA I was expecting maybe slightly more bitterness and the flavors to be more robust; however, I still enjoyed it immensely. The appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel all seemed to be cohesive and meld together nicely. For as sucky as you expect this beer to be, all you want to do is have another glass."

"Overall: Simply amazing beer, easily my favorite that I've had from Lagunitas, though I'm not sure I'd classify this particular beer as a DIPA. All the same this is an amazingly good beer. I'm stunned that so much flavor can be packed into such an affordable package. Once this goes year round it'll be a staple in my fridge."
""

"O: Lagunitas describes this as a cereal medley, so I must love cereal. The oats and rye give this beer a spicy creaminess that is 'spot on'. And the citrus and tropical notes pair wonderfully with the malty sweetness. This stuff goes down so easy. Its time to find a cloned version of this beer before I end up in the poor house."

"On tap at Williams $3 pint night. Served with a skimming of filmy white head this is a completely clear beer dark golden with a light orange tint. Big time hop aroma. Notes of tropical mango and citrus grapefruit. Taste is hop forward with a definite malt backbone. A smooth beer with a bitter but crisp aftertaste. This is a solid big yet not overpowering hop bomb. A nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another great beer from Lagunitas, and with an IPA lineup like they have, I would expect nothing less. Favorite part about this brew is the smell, and it's pretty much everything I could want out of the aroma from an IPA. Bold hop flavor, clean citrus, and some fragrant florals. Absolutely great smell. Looks very similar to their other IPAs, a bright golden, perfectly transparent, but with some very small suspended bubbles. Taste is all about hops and citrus. You will feel like you just enjoyed a fresh, tart and perfectly sweet grapefruit after you take a sip. Overall, more well balanced then Hop Stoopid, exceptionally smooth and drinkable."

"O: For a hophead, this one is outstanding. Can't beat the price either."
"The taste was a letdown because everything else was great."
"12oz bottle, pours golden in color topped with a frothy, white head. Good retention, and tons of sticky lacing is left one the glass. Aromas are bright and fresh with tropical citrus notes of pineapple and mango along with grapefruit, sweet honey, biscuity malt. Wow, I could smell this all day. Tastes are sweet and tropical; similar to aroma with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, honey, biscuity malt finds its way in there, a tad boozy, finishes sweet, but bitter and dry. Full of flavor with nice balance here. Medium body, nice and smooth with ample carbonation. Overall, top notch American DIPA, especially for the price in comparison to the other over-priced competitors."

"Fantastic. I've had this on tap and bottle this year. Smells strongly of citrus and pine. Tastes the same. Strong hoppy flavor. Mouthfeel not thick and creamy, but still not insignificant. Perhaps more impressive than Hopslam this year. Outstanding!"

"The hops present themselves as the dominant character in the taste with a muted maltiness and sweetness. But quite frankly, I found this beer to be about level with any number of IPA's I have had."

"O- I saw this at the bar and decided to give it a go since I heard it was good. Don't pass up the opportunity! I hope to get my hands on a sixer of this stuff in the near future if I can find it. Overall, a very well-rounded beer that you will not be disappointed in."

"Clear golden orange, with a few fingers of looser white head. Great retention and lacing. Nose is knee buckling - insane tropical and melon character, slight pine and a beautiful sweet malt base. Slight floral character as well. More tropical fruit on the palate, melon skins, peach and a slight bitterness. Finish is mostly sweet. Low carbonation, perfect mouthfeel. I would drink this by the case."

""
""
"O ~ I would buy this again, its got a good hop backbone in there and some fruitiness as well. also I think I only spent 11 or 12 on a 6 pack, which isn't bad at all for an Imperial IPA."
""
"I was not disappointed with this one. I am a sucker for highly carbonated and grapefruit hoppy goodness. This one succeeded on both counts. As other reviewers have said, it would be difficult to get past one or two of these in a sitting. But in my opinion that is one high quality sit that you'll be having. Strong enough for a cold winter night, but would be equally as enjoyable grill side. Can't wait for the next 6pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I tried to fault this beer, I really did. But I can't. Look out boys and girls, there's a new sheriff in town. In hindsight, I think this year's batch was exceptional compared to previous years."
"copper color, citrus notes with aroma, lots of pine with taste, good level of hops up front. Lingering bitterness and pine aftertones. Very drinkable and I hope this one will be available year round as per recent rumors. this will go down as one of my favorite ipas that is readily accessible to me. AT least thus far..."
"Lagunitas sucks pours a bright gold with a decent white head. The aroma is herbal, tropical and citrusy hops with no hint of bitterness. Citrus and tropical hops dominate the flavor as well, but there is tons of pale malt sweetness. The bitterness is surprisingly light probably partially due to the sweetness. Overall the hop flavor is hard to beat, and the sweetness and lack of bitterness make it extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
"O - This beer is too damn easy for 7.85%. It's delicious in every way, But it is not a Maxiumus."
"O: This beer is definitely worth trying, especially if you're not averse to bitterness. Enjoyable overall, but not as balanced as it could be. Would be difficult to drink more than one bottle of this in a session."
""
""
"O: All I can say is """I love this beer!""" Hands down one of the best I gave had. Super excited to try the rest of the Lagunitas line up. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - I'm not a big hophead, but I enjoyed this beer. Nice to find an American IPA that doesn't overwhelm you with grapefruit rind. Easy drinking for nearly 8% ABV"
""
" The taste of this is juicy with tropical hop flavors w/ slight herbal component and gentle malt accent in the background which hints at caramel with mild pine element in the hop flavor coming out mid taste with a slight fruity yeast essence in the finish. Overall a very good ale, I actually prefer this to Brown Shugga, a little less dry than some west coast Imperial Ipa's, however it is very fresh and has a full hop taste from beginning to end with emphasis on hop flavor rather than just bitterness which I like compared to others of its ilk."
""
"O- One of the most balanced IPA's out there, very drinkable and not too bitter. The hop aroma is really what sets this beer apart for me. It is a must try that I wish was available year round. P.S. I really think that this beer should be classified as a single IPA in my opinion. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Its good points are the noticeableness of the hops, and that it's very easy drinking. On the other hand, I could use more malt and more fruitiness in the hops. I have also had this same batch when it was several weeks fresher, and my impressions were similar."

"Beautiful beer - exceptionally drinkable with a lovely complex hoppiness"
"Overall: A very interesting and very hoppy beer. The complexity of ingredients is astounding, so many hop and malt varieties playing roles in the final product. Also, as many have found, the hop character is intoxicating! I love this beer, would most definitely purchase it frequently if it were year round, few hop-bombs like this make it to my home-state of Montana."
""

"Overall: Upon first sips, this was a special treat. Something that can truly be enjoyed in the spring/summer and even in the winter as I am doing so now. Even my date stated it was good, and also claims not to be a beer drinker. But overall, this beer packed something different and did it well. The citrus and fruit-like hops with a nice balance of malt in the mix that create something I will enjoy again and will recommend to friends. Cheers!"

"Overall- nothing especially new or adventurous. A rather typical west coast, citric heavy DIPA. But, that said- it is superbly well done for that, with only a bit too much sweetness to complain about."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful golden color with nice white head. Smell was big on grapefruit and dank hops. The problem was a noticeable aroma of cat urine. Not a good aroma and I couldn't escape it. Flavor of the beer was nice and very dry and hop forward but the ammonia was overwhelming. I'm not surprised to see this beer rated so highly by the general public (lagunitas has a great following and generally makes top notch brews) but the alstrom bros have a score that is much more accurate."
"O- It's been about 6 months since I've really sat down with such a big and traditional west coast IPA. Lagunitas did a great job with this beer. Sweet, citrusy, and easy on the palate. The balance adds an element of drinkability that acts as the cherry on top. "

"Sucks! this beer absolutely does not! It only sucks if you have not had this tasty little treat. Bottle date is 2-06-13, pretty fresh if you ask me. The aroma as soon as I popped one of these babies was so juicy and sweet! Up front pineapple, pear, apricot, citrus, pine, you know everything a great DIPA should smell like, well that x10.. This beer pours a pale orange-gold with two fingers of cream colored head. First sip is all hops, taste is just as dynamic as the aroma, but the more this beer warms, the more malt character begins to come through. Extremely drinkable, I am already done with my review sample bottle before I even finished this review. Overall, I gotta put """Sucks""" right up there in my top 5 DIPA's of all time. Time for another!"

"0 - A well-done DIPA/IIPA, but differs from other takes on the style not as much bitterness from the hops as others out there. Certainly enjoyable for a Sunday evening. Served in my Teku glass."

"pours the color of honey one finger head and a ring of light lace with each sip. smells strongly of fruit and alcohol. taste of peach mango and papaya, alcohol hits you right away then the bitter taste of the hops which are strong and ending with a lasting after taste. mouthfeel is light and slightly oily carbonation is tight and crisp. its very different from ipa,s that i have had and i am not a fan of them but i would buy this beer again for a change of the same old."

"Gorgeous pour with enormous amounts of white lacing as the pint goes down, and a decent creamy sized head to start the pint. Nose is candied and fresh, doughy almost. Palate has some good flavors of citrus with malt to balance it out, pine too, but oh my goodness the booze is just over the top. With the booziness I would have sworn it is a 10% beer but it's not, as it's barely higher than a normal IPA in the 7% range. So this is a major flaw because so many really good examples and great examples do so much better at integrating flavors that yields a non-boozy result. Just not all that enjoyable to drink this one, though it is great to look at and smell. But I can't get over that with every sip I feel like I'm downing some alcohol bomb... but it's actually not very strong."

"D/O: This big IPA is the hedonist's choice for the style--it presents abundant hops and abundant malt sugar that are surprisingly successful at balancing each other. As a DIPA it is more believable, but here it wins because it retains easily observed defining characteristics that the bigger DIPAs simply lose control over. Flavors may step over a line of appropriateness--if this is a regular IPA--but seem tight and much more modern compared to most DIPAs. Pliny it is not--that beer is an exercise in restraint while this is a projection of excess on a budget. Exact style aside, this beer succeeds resoundingly at delivering some of the most desirable hops qualities available without the burden of a 10% abv investment."

"Wow - I was very suprised by this. I got Lagunitas Sucks the same time I picked up Hopslam. I have been so nuts about Hopslam that I under estimated how this beer would compare. It blew me away and I might honestly like it better than Hopslam. Obviously its not quite as hoppy but it is well balanced all around. Seriously one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
"O - killer smooth IPA. My favorite lagunitas by far. It's not as good as the hype, but its definitely in the neighborhood."
"On one other note, after I had a bottle of sucks i split a bittle of arrogant bastard, and it was the first time ive ever called arrogant bastard sweet and brown sugary."
"I'll have to try another and see."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not sure if I'd put this into DIPA territory or not... It toes the line between big, hoppy American IPA and DIPA - kind of a toss up depending on the scale of your lupulin threshold. Plus, the lower abv at 7.85% leans it slightly toward """single""" IPA. Anyway, this is great beer. Quite delicious and drinkable - next time I'll get a sixer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to admit that this severly underwhelmed me. I expect my 4.4 rated DIPA's to blast me in the face with hops. This guy is really tame...perhaps too well-balanced...for my true enjoyment. I liked this beer, don't get me wrong, but I kept looking at it, hoping it would grab me and it never did."
""
""
"Had this one on draft where freshness always seems assured. It is a hop blast, what can I say. Almost felt like drinking cannabis mixed with OJ. The hoppiness dominates the beer a little too much, but tis all the rage I guess. Good to get it nice and fresh though and it is a fine beer."
""
"O: 4.5 - probably one of the best bargains on the market for a DIPA (<$10/sixer in the greater Washington D.C. area) , which was only accentuated by comparing it side-by-side with (the ridiculously overpriced) Bell's Hopslam; Sucks clearly won this tropical fruit challenge for me."
""
"O: I didn't know what to think before trying this one. Lagunitas has been a mixed bag for me. As soon as I opened it, I knew this beer was going to be amazing. A good smelling beer is like a pheromone, and the taste matched it's wonderful smell."
"Notes: Really nice IPA (I don't really see it as a double but whatever). Balanced and quite refreshing. Nice mix of different hoppy flavors, but what really made this nice was just how fresh the hop flavors were and how it jumped out at you. Great clean, slightly sweet, malt backbone that allowed that to happen. Worth picking up a sixer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An outstanding DIPA from one of the greatest breweries on the planet. They absolutely crushed this one. This is the perfect IPA imo, fruit & hop heavy - little pine, no floral flavor, minimal malts, yet balanced. At $9.99 a six pack this is my favorite seasonal double IPA. More affordable than HopSlam or Abrasive but it has just as much flavor. I would kill to have this on tap in Cali. Lagunitas Sucks."

"Particularly for the price, this is a hop-head's delight - complex, flavorful, well crafted, and intense without being overdone or generic. Very satisfying."
"The beer pours a lovely oranged yellow, almost golden, with a great big slightly cream white head that sits at over two finger widths. The body is light and translucent, with only the faintest mist of haze, and a steady stream of gentle carbonation bubbles working to the top of the glass. The beer’s lacing is droopy and thin, leaving a spatterwork of hanging sheets upon the sides of the glass. On the nose the beer smells big with minty pine, a touch of citrus, and a faint touch of salty onion. The grains are found only as the lightest backdrop for the smell, suggesting slight toasty bread and caramel. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with a nice light sweet tinge. The beer begins with sweet bitters before opening into slightly caramelly herbal bitters that lightly suggest mint and onion. The finish runs with a light touch of orange citrus and is strong with pine, which lasts into the finish. The aftertaste is light with medicinal bitters and piney hops. On the mouth, the beer feels medium-light in body, with just the faintest gelling to suggest a heavier beer. The carbonation leaves a decent prickle on the tongue, and after the beer leaves the mouth is left sticky-dry, with a bitter astringency gripping at the tongue, though the mouth is clean. Overall, I’m a little disappointed with Sucks… Lots of people are heralding this beer as an amazing DIPA, but honestly I see it more as a strong IPA, falling just short of the bigger flavors that a DIPA carries. The beer is nicely drinkable, and carries some nice bitters, but the onioniness that this beer has is throwing me off the taste, and other than that I fine the hop profile a little lackluster in terms of complexity. Just to clarify, I have tried a six-pack of these now, and all of them have had the slight onion flavor, which is odd and I suppose I will chalk up to an older pack (though they had spent less than a week on the shelf when I picked them up…). This beer is a mediocre almost-DIPA, in my book, but is not really worthy of hunting down."
"I'm not going into any more detail about my ranking, as I won't be describing anything that hasn't already been posted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've come full circle on this beer now. I loved its first release in 2011. The first time I had this year's batch I was surprised at how malty it was, given how everyone kept calling it a DIPA. That, combined with the fact that I picked up on less hops than I do now, made me think of this as more of a strong ale, so it took away points for the lack of sticking to the style. However, I keep drinking it and now I can't stop. I dont care if I get a heavy malty stickyness from that cereal medley of malt, it tastes really good. Call it what you will, but I'm in favor of a beer that just tastes great, even if it doesn't fit squarely into one style. For $9/6 pack, I can't imagine I will drink much else while this is available."
"Overall: Lagunitas excels at hop forward beers and Sucks is one of the Crown Jewels. I bought two six packs and will be back to get more before its gone. Highly recommended for all hop heads. Buy it while you can!"

"A bit more malt backbone and higher ABV and this would be 5's across the board for me. As it is, it's still phenomenal, but not quite 100."

"overall? decent. seems everyone else is scoring it highly and i can appreciate what i'm drinking. it's a great in-betweener of all the different beers i have lined up for the afternoon but i imagine my tongue would shrivel up and i would lose my appetite (maybe not a bad thing in my case) if i were to drink the entire six pack of this. but i believe it earns the scores i give it... and i like the high abv!"

""
"Very interesting aroma here. Burley tobacco and super piney hops lead the nose and the taste follows suit. The mouthfeel is medium. The over-the-topness falls short in the finish as the sweet hoppiness thins out. Overall a very good IPA and the aroma alone makes it worth the cost of the six-pack. Will definitely buy again."
"O-	This IIPA is absolutely dialed in. Every aspect of the brew compliments the other. The most balanced take on the style I have had to date!"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a DIPA. Certainly makes it quite drinkable and refreshing. Overall, this is certainly an excellent DIPA but it falls just short of some of my favorites which seem to have more body to them."
"M&D&O - an improperly named beer, nothing sucks about this brew othere than running out. its simple without being boring, provocative without being complex,a wonderful beer"

""
"O: a very good beer, but less heavy than most of its peers which makes for an almost session-able drink; I'd certainly buy it again, but I think the hype exceeds the beer"
"Overall - Whatever the opposite of Sucks is, that is what you can label this beer. It is simply amazing. A great smell, great taste, and perfectly balanced. This is not overpowering and it is very refreshing. Hopefully, Lagunitas will begin distributing this beer year round because once a year is not enough. I hope to find another sixer of this soon because this is simply delicious!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a orangish straw with a one finger white head that dissipates but leaves nice lacing. Smells of citrus hops and slight sweet malt. Tastes of earthy hops and grain, nice bite lingering, and not over the top. Beer is a little heavier carbonated for a DIPA but very dangerous as it is extremely drinkable with its light but not too light body. Overall, a superb beer."

Lots of pine and tropical hop flavors with a crushed grain maltiness that is a little heavier than 'biscuit'...maybe 'hint-o-caramel' works better. The components are supremely well integrated, it is so smooth and...well...delicious. While this tastes similar to many of Lagunitas' other offerings, it almost seems like they have perfected it here. At 7.85%, I would argue this fits better in the regular IPA category than DIPA but they seem to have failed to axe my opinion. I might go so far as to say this is Petaluma's best beer, it really is delicious."
"O: I really, really, really like this beer. It was a third hop """eureka""" moment for me. This is a serious must-try if you have anything more than a passing interest in hoppy beers! Absolutely excellent."

"This is the '86 Celtics of Double IPAs. Currently my favorite beer - glad it's readily available here in RI."

"Overall - I would say that this is one of the most unique brews I have ever had. It is one of those brews where a review simply does not do it justice, you need to try it for yourself."

"O - One of the more vexing beers I had in age; I wound up not liking it on first taste, and craving more by the time I finished my glass. What do they put in this stuff? In all seriousness, a well-crafted, and slightly unique, DIPA. Will almost certainly buy again."
"Aroma of nice hoppy goodness. Rye, grapefruit zest, apricot, and honey. Pours bronze with a smal healthy head. Taste is marvelously hoppy with dried apricot, grapefruit and brown sugar. Finishes nice and sticky. Gotta love the humility of Lagunitas considering this is one of the finest IPA's out there."
"Overall - Unfortunately, I think for me this is another case of a supremely hyped up brew that had no chance to live up to the billing. It is an excellent beer, and I would certainly recommend it, but don't get swept up in the fever. I said the same thing about Hopslam, and I drank them one day apart. I'd take Myrcenary over either of them. But this is a very good brew."

"You can really taste the unique brown sugar, yet it's not too sweet that it over powers. The color was a bit more burnt golden than most beers. Lagunita's has always been one of my favorite breweries and I believe this has taken place for my number one Lagunita's. The name definitely speaks irony."

"O. To be honest, I found it to be very similar to the Lagunitas IPA, with a hint more of spice. And that's a good thing, because I love that brew. Very good."

""
""
""
"O: It's all about the hops here but Lagunitas' """cereal medley""" adds subtlety and complexity which elevates the palate. The unique personality of Sucks is intriguing but ultimately I need more fruit to balance the earthiness and bitterness in this brew. Sucks finally hit stores in the Los Angeles area and I am both grateful and honored to finally experience this Imperial IPA."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/19/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, and earthy hops. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity, balance, and strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, pine, floral, honey, grass, and herbal hop earthiness. Good amount of piney citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zests, citrus rind, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, honey, and herbal hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic hop complexity, with a nice malt balance supporting the big hops; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA. Great hop complexity with nice malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."
"O - A superb IPA. Glorious hops dominate from start to finish. A light caramel sweetness lends a little balance. Alcohol is masked well. I appreciate the low price point, considering the high quality. This is up there with the best of em."
"Basically, friends, this is a beer that needs to be enjoyed as often as possible and as fresh as possible. I only hope that BC breweries make something of this caliber in the next five years. That'd be fairly desirable."

""
"O: One heck of Double IPA, just a work of art. A happy, hoppy accident for certain!"
""
""
""
"O: It might not be mind-blowing, but it is a high-end DIPA for sure. This is a beer which has grown on me---each has been better than the last. Definitely worth going out of your way for, though you might not have to now that it is going to be year round."
""
""
"Overall this one is great. Easily one of the best IPAs I've had in a while."
"O: A remarkably delicious, full flavored balanced west coast IPA that blew me away in all aspects. At $9.99 (found it for $8.99 on sale) a six pack it's a no-brainer."
"Food and warming brings out piney and herbal earthy hop flavors in this beer."

""
""
"By far probably my favorite beer that I have tried! Poor's a beautiful golden color with a really nice head that settles well. Holy Shit the smell is absolutely fantastic. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange just an amazing smell that takes my breath away. Taste just as good if not better then it smells. The carbonation is very well balanced and the sucks is a very easy beer to drink. But WOW just a fantastic beer!!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, solid and attractive flavors. It's great to see the legacy California breweries, like Lagunitas and Stone, stepping up their IPA offerings over the past year or so."
""
"Not an absolute hop bomb, but this was quite enjoyable."
""
""

"Overall: This grain bill simply acts as a canvas for the beautiful expressive colors of the hops. While not balanced in terms of maltiness and hop character the hops are celebrated appropriately. Seek this beer out!"

""
"I love this beer as I am now on my 4th 6 pack of it, that being said I do prefer Maximus slightly because of the stronger malt bill but the margain is so small that it is basically a tie. Man Lagunitas knows how to work the hops that is for sure!"

"O - Amazing beer that needs to be available year round!"
"Overall, a really amazing IIPA. Extremely drinkable it feels more like 5% abv. Love the tropical, almost minty, hop character and the moderate bitterness. Definitely one to stock up on this time of year and one of the best from Lagunitas."
"Verdict: A very fine IPA from Lagunitas and the fanfare is justified here. It's crisp, clean, satisfyingly bitter and while not overly complex, the balance is perfect. Definitely worth checking out for any hophead."
""
""
""
"I thought Brown Shugga was terrible but this DIPA drinks like a dream! I've heard a bit about this beer and its completely deserving of the hype. Usually not a huge fan of anything Lagunitas makes but this beer might just have made me a convert!"
"Pours a crystal clear light golden color with a decent sized bone white head that leaves much stickage on the way down. Smells of hops in spades. Light green onion and garlic grow confidently under a shady pine tree while sipping on a hint of vodka. Light bready malt peaks through but barely musters the courage to stick around. The flavor is light cracker and bready malts with an onslaught of onion garlic and pine. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. This is a very nice IPA I'm glad I grabbed the six pack so I can enjoy this again."

"I'd like to try drinking a couple a day for a week or so to see if it will stand up to regular use."

"Pours a clear golden brown with a 1 finger white head and some nice lacing. The smell is fantastic with grapefruit floral grainy sweetness and some lemon notes. The flavor is not overly bitter with a big citrus hop flavor up front and a mild lingering bitterness with a faint malt profile. The mouthfeel is a bit light for the style but very drinkable. Overall this is an interesting brew with a really cool hop profile, I have been enjoying it for weeks."

"Had while hanging out at Potent Potables with beermeX2! Served from tap into Lagunitas mason jar style glass (proper!). Poured golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, onion, onion hop, and subtle citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, onion hop, onion, earth, citrus, and grass. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I was surprised at how easy this one was to drink and how refreshing it was. You would never imagine that this brew was almost 8% ABV by the aroma or flavor. I could definitely see myself drinking a ton of this before it was too late with no problem at all. A really well done brew that I would love to have time and time again."
"grain with a medium-full body and a pretty viscous feel. Great hop libation!"

"This is what sculpin used to be two years ago. Pours a golden amber brown with two fingers of fluffy eggshell white foam leaving sexy legs as i drink. The nose carries citrus, tropical fruit pith, dank forest floor. The taste opens with bright papaya and mango, a touch of pineapple followed by sour strawberries and a pleasant skunkiness. It wraps up with malt and a touch of eucaliptus oil. Very pleasant to drink with a nice hop bitterness playing counterpoint to the light malt sweetness. Never knew Lagunitas could pull this off, liked there other offerings love this one."
""
"O- find this beer and drink it. Will be looking for this again."
"This is medium to full bodied, with smooth carbonation. This is very delicious. Will drink again!"
"massive grapefruit taste with so much pine I thought I was camping. I has a nose tingle hop kick - sticky sweet lacing lasts a long time; at 62 IBUs i expected something more mellow, but like it nonetheless; not enough malt push for any higher rating."
"A super DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very short malt start; strong, nearly harsh, hop bitterness. It is particularly strong in the swallow and the long aftertaste. The body leans to the full side. The carbonation is fine."
""
"O: This is much less """Holiday""" than I remember it on draft. Back in the Fall of 2011 when they released this for the first time, it had a Holiday theme with some spices and such. This is just straight up, high IBU, citrus-smack hop-explosion. If you're into that. In summary...sooo Lagunitas!"

"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle, the beer was a copper color with a modest white head. On the glass, lacing was left behind and retention was demonstrated. In the aroma, one gets a big hit of pine with a measure of citrus in the background. The aroma is actually quite potent. In the initial taste, one gets pine, lime rind, and grapefruit. Sour tickles the sides of the tongue with a candy sweetness goes down the center. The sourness is what lingers most into the aftertaste. This does not dismiss the warming sensation that follows the beer down to the beer belly. The texture is appropriate for the style and little carbonate is evident. The thickness allows the sour to linger nicely on the tongue. Lagunitas makes quality accessible beers for a cheap price. With Lagunitas Sucks, they hit it out of the park."

"O - Great to see this on the shelf at Whole Foods after hearing a lot of good things. The tropical and citrus fruit is prominent on the nose and the tongue. Remarkably balanced and one of the easiest drinking """Double""" IPAs I have come across. At 10.99/six, good bang for your buck, as all Lagunitas seem to be."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is an almost perfect IPA. I'd like it to be a bit more resinous though. Damn good beer from Lagunitas!"
""
""
"Big thanks to jzeilinger for bringing this one for me to try. This poured out as a nice looking orange color with a white head on top. The head settles a little bit but leaves a really nice sticky lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is ripe with citrus notes and some addition pine in there. It smells like a DIPA for sure, and a good one at that! The taste of the beer is hoppy with the citrusy pine notes with some subtle caramel malts in the finish. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and has an oily feel to it while remaining lighter bodied. Overall I thought it was a killer beer, probably best when it's fresh and I believe this was."

"O: I didn't particularly enjoy my first impressions of this beer, but it has grown on me considerably through the course of the glass. While I continue to be somewhat unenthusiastic about the aroma (mostly just not my favorite hop profile, but also that soapy note hiding in there), I do like the way this beer manages to hit the sweet & sticky DIPA style while maintaining a relatively modest ABV."
""
""
"O: As often happens with the style, the malt lost out to the hops. It was pleasant enough to drink, but not enough to entice me to buy more."
"Cheers!!!"

"O- Perfection! Buy as much as you can, I have only found a few brews this good (Founders Harvest Ale , Bells Hopslam, Ballast Pt. Sculpin) which are around double the cost. Had it on tap last month at Fireworks in Leesburg and it was even better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bummer about Brown Sugar but way to make lemonade."
""
"The taste is crisp, juicy, bitter citrus hops. Same profile as the aroma. Enough sweet malt to keep it balanced, but not so much as to distract from the hop showcase. The finish is almost perfect, with a bitterness that's prominent but doesn't outstay its welcome. Mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation, and nicely dry. Overall, this is a hell of an IPA. Quite excellent."

"At 7.85%, it drinks like something much, much stronger. Lots of hop aroma and flavor without all of the alcohol. Pick it up!"

"Wow! This is a really great double IPA. About as perfect as I've had. I love Lagunitas and Brown Shugga but this one really takes the cake. I haven't had anything from these guys that I didn't love."

""
"Overall: A perfect DIPA. I can't get over how crisp and clean the hop flavors and aromas are in this beer. Honestly, this beer has some of the most clean, and complex hop flavors and aromas I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Lagunitas really does create magic with hops, and how well they balance out strong hop profiles with sweet, complez malt flavors as well. If you love hops, you'll love this. I can find nothing wrong with this beer, at all."
""
""
""
""

"The palate opens with a blend of the fruity hops and some of the malt sweetness. The fruity flavors are a riot, they are super-fresh, juicy, vibrant and refreshing. Mandarins, peach, mango and melon are exuberantly expressed here, making the hop bitterness relatively insignificant. The sweetness is medium-low, mostly with flavors of honey and a kind of cracker-like malt character. While the sweetness is a little higher than I'd typically care for, it does work here. The mouthfeel is rather excellent too. Hoppy without being too resiny (not that that's ever been a problem for me), a water profile that really works with the flavor profile (not too chalky/mineral-y), and with a moderate carbonation level (a little too high IMO), this is very enjoyable. The finish is pleasantly bitter and resiny, but is also very fruity. Excellent stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, how pleasantly surprised I was with this one! Great balance without being too malty. Good bitterness but not enough to ruin your taste buds for an evening. This one could easily get dangerous. I'll probably buy a case if I come across any more."
""
""
""
"O: A welcomed return from Lagunitas. I found that this one really loses its character quickly. The first one was literally the day my man got it and WOW-spectacular. Begins to mute after a couple weeks. Highly recommended."
"Fantastic IPA! Needs few words."
""
"Poured into a snifter this beer is a slightly hazy golden color with a medium white head that leaves beautiful lacing. The aroma is intensely hoppy--tropical fruits, some pine and some whiffs of booze and bready malt--very nice. The flavor is balanced toward very fruity, slightly piney hop flavor but malty sweetness and some hints of ABV emerge after the burst of hops. Bitterness is smooth and appropriately high. The mouthfeel is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall an incredible beer--wonderful aroma and flavor--really enjoy the tropical fruity hops."

"Hazy orange color, white head that sinks but sticks. Great aroma of fuzzy peaches and peach jolly ranchers. Flavor doesn't quite match up. It's got some fruit and some bitterness but its just good, not great. Little bit of alcohol, eh. People hyped this up and while its a good beer it's not all that. I regret buying a second six pack honestly."
"O: An incredibly drinkable double IPA and probably my favorite Lagunitas offering thus far! I was definitely worried that a double IPA from Lagunitas would be overkill on the hop bitterness, but this was very well balanced and delicious!"
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head that has good retention and lacing. Aroma of piney, herbal, lightly floral hops, grapefruit and apple. Nice. Flavor combines piney and citrus hops with an excellent bready malt body with notes of grapefruit, lemon, citrus rind and light fruit. Very nice. Even if this had sucked, you would have to admire a brewery that responded to massive disappointment and anguish for the lack of a beloved beer with a tongue in cheek spoof offering that ended up even more popular than the original. This was a triumph for everyone."

"The best IPA I have had in recent memory. I could drink boat loads of this stuff. Lagunitas Sucks definitely does not! (4.75)"

"Pours a clear classic golden color with a short white head. Not much head formed due to how carefully the beer was poured by the bartender. The bouquet might be the best of any beer I've ever had. Fresh grapefruit right up front with some underlying cannabis. Just a wonderful aroma. Mouthfeel is full, wet, and a bit oily. Carbonation bites just a bit on the finish. The flavor is magnificent. Grapefruit! A lot more pine in the flavor than appeared in the bouquet. Just enough rye in this beer to set all the flavors and aromas off in a more vibrant fashion. A remarkably well-engineered brew."

"O: Man, this is one insanely drinkable IIPA. The feel really helps with this, as does the 63 IBUs. It doesn't wreck your palate and makes it very easy to go back for more. After this 6 is gone, I might have to get a case..."

"2012 RELEASE: one of the best DIPAs in the world. tropical fruits galore, with just the right amount of malt backing. faint alcohol presence, and a surprising lack of bitterness -- significantly less bitter than Maximus or several other Lagunitas offerings. this beer sits alongside Pliny and Heady Topper as my favorite DIPAs. great job Lagunitas. 4.75"

"They always seem to put out solid beers and this one does not disappoint! Thankfully they have made this a year round brew because it is solid up and down. My only regret is I bought this one in a build your own 6 pack and I only picked 1 of these up. If you're not afraid of a well rounded beer with an amazing taste, you should definately give this a try, you won't be disappointed."

"It is hard to describe without characteristics. so best rating as If it were a beer judge judging, (and as a homebrewer, I can tell they can be cruel sometimes.) This is one of the best seasonal releases available, It has great appearance, clear, heady, smooth, hoppy, spicy, woody, definitely a cousin of brown shugga, But with a complex """lightness""" careful, these are easy to drink!"
""

"had this beer on tap today and it blew me away. had it later in the bottle and it wasn't as impressive. seek it out on tap."
"O: Overall, I really like this beer. A great beer to have if you want to have 2-4 in a night, as I dont think I could do it for more than that due to the sweetness. I had some reservations after the brown shugga (which I really didnt care for) but this beer is great and balances the hops and fruity flavors like no other beer does. You wont find another beer to directly compare this to. Cheers Lagunitas, youve won me back...if you permanently """substitute""" this for brown shugga I will never complain."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of the style, while it didn't have the high amount of bitterness I normally find in this style it sure did have all that great fruity hops flavors and aromas, it was very enjoyable beer. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, had tons of great flavors that held my attention, and the low amount of bitterness really helped the drinkability, I could drink quite a few of these when in the mood, fruity hops with out too much alcohol and too much bitterness, yes please! What I like the most about this beer was how awesome the fruity hop profile in this beer was, I don't think I have ever picked up peaches from hops before, I also really liked the appearance, it was really good looking. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I will be going back to the store to get at least a six pack, I will be looking forward to the yearly release of this beer and I highly recommend this beer to just about anyone, even if you aren't crazy about hops, you should still give this beer a try. All in all I was very impressed with this beer, it's everything that I hoped it would be and just a little more, it had one of the best hop profiles that I have encountered in a long time. Lagunitas did a kick ass job with this beer and I'm glad I finally got a chance to try it, this is one of the better beers that i have had from them, maybe the best, I was already a fan of Lagunita's but this beer puts them close to being my favorite out of state brewery, great job guys, I can't get enough of this stuff."

"This is really good stuff. Highly recommended."
" Decent ipa, very crisp, simple overall"

"This is very easy to drink and is more hop forward and less malt focused which I like in a Imperial IPA. This is a very good example of the style, but I have definitely had better. If you can find this, give it a try."
"Taste: Efficient strait forward light clean not a huge mouth full, I like them to linger a bit more, but a very solid effort."

"O: Overall, this is a good beer. Honestly, with all the hype, I was pretty disappointed. Its good, but its no where near the top of the DIPAs Ive had, and its not my favorite Lagunitas beer (I had Hop Stoopid last night, and I think that was better than this one, and Maximus gives it a run for its money in my book as well). Either way though, an enjoyable beer, and Im surely going to have no trouble finishing the 6 pack in a timely manner."

"I went back the next day for some more."
"Overall – Really good stuff.. like a beefed up sweeter version of their 'lil sumthin sumthin' - also similar to some of the green flash beers or the sixpoint resin. I think I expected a little more based on reviews, but it's still definitely a beer I'd buy again."

"Delicious beer, right here. Lagunitas knows their way around an IPA (see: Hop Stoopid) and this beer is no exception. A wonderfully fruity nose and a well-balanced body, complete with heavy hop bitterness and dry, bready malt, this IPA is sure to please any hop head. Wish it were more readily available."

"O: Could be the best Lagunitas beer I have had. Would stock this in my fridge all the time."

"Golden with a fair amount of carbonation. Plentiful white head and loads of sticky lace. Aroma has lots of grapefruit and pineapple. Secondary to this is a bit of malt sweetness and a hint of alcohol in the background. Resinous pine balanced nicely with a slight sweetness. Some of the alcohol is noticeable at the end. Despite the strong hop aroma, it finishes with only a medium amount of bitterness and is somewhat dry. Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation."

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation, and a grapefruit pineapple aftertaste. Very nicely made. I could buy this on a regular basis, just like I do with Hop Stoopid, and a Litttle Sumpin' Sumpin'."

"Love this shit!!!! IMO, this hop profile is askew from the rest of their lineup which I think tends to be harsh. What makes this so great is the fact it's in six-packs at an affordable price. I'll stand this right up there with FFF ZD anyday. This is masterfully constructed and super easy to drink. As they say """Doggone good"""."
"This one is great!! I’m impressed indeed, YUM!!! The last couple of Lagunitas I’ve had have been less than desirable compared the NW rivals, espacially the growing WA beers!!! Appearance is OK, pretty clean, good lacing... Much lighter than the typical DIPA... I think what make this beer so good is the fine line of not over-doing ’it’ in any particular area (hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level). VERY refreshing and will get again and...…Goin’ to look for a tap ASAP!!!"

"Overall: Get it,"
""
"All in all, it's an interesting experiment, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I do like heavy sipping beers, and I do like refreshing hoppy beers, but usually not in this combination."
"O-A totally fruit-forward-in-your-face hop bomb of a beer. And I mean that in the best way. This a great-tasting IIPA style beer, but brace yourself for some sweetness and fruity hops. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't handle more than one per evening. Cliche review comment: this beer is really good, but lacks the balance to make it great. (See Pliny the Elder.)"
"Overall: I had high expectations for this brew but was a little disappointed. Lagunitas makes some very solid beer and I would say this one is just that, solid. A little unique tang for an IPA, worth a try but don't go out of your way for this one."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a sweet tropical hop paradise. Such an amazing and easy to drink beer with no alcohol presence. I have got to get more of this one."
"Poured this hilarious bottle into a tulip glass. Light orange with a single finger white head. Smells are lots of pine, earthy, sweet bread, citrus of course. Taste starts off with carmel and blends into citrus and rosemary, mango, and has a nice thickness to it, very smooth, if this is a substitute, keep messing up because this is amazing. It's a pretty consistent Dipa, doesn't change too much from start to finish,"
""
""
""
"Overall: This thing is amazing and I look forward for it every year. Try it. Especially for its value. Can't say enough good things about it."
""
"Overall: Pretty damn good beer. It is not good it is really good, I have a couple of other Imperial IPAs that I would put ahead of the food chain but this one does the job (and some). Salud!"
"O: This beer makes me verbose and lyrical. (Or pretentious? I don't think Lagunitas has that aim, though.) This is an all star beer that I buy every time it comes out, which, now shouldn't be a problem with the expansion in place. Lagunitas sucks, indeed."
"Overall, a very fine resiny, dank, fruity IPA - a little watery though."
""
"O - i really enjoyed this beer. the aroma was inviting, little aftertaste, and easily drinkable. It was a bit shy in the maltiness character but I was happy to have scored a six pack yesterday! This will always be on my list of buys when available."

The hops are really highlighted with this brew and I'm very excited to finally have found it and gotten the chance to try it (I missed it last year because I was travelling)."

"My God! What is this concoction? It's remarkable as hell, but it pretty much defies categorization. Everything starts in one way and ends with another with this beer... And for that reason alone is an incredible recipe. Not sure how often I'd take another again, but it is relatively easy for me to drink (save for the malt dry finish), so I will take another if offered. Yet, ever since having it, I have been craving to return to the store and analyze everything about this beer. Call me nuts, but it simply is the least """sucky""" beer possible. No clue what it is, but it's good. Yes, good. Let's keep it at that!"
""
""
"Overall: Great beer, great value for what amounts to a DIPA (I don't care what anyone says) at $9/6pk. On its own, it stands up to most of the other excellent DIPAs I've had, but it doesn't quite supplant them. It smells great, looks great and that goes a long way towards making this an enjoyable beer to drink. I'd probably take this over stuff like Hopslam and Double Crooked Tree, but maybe not over something such as Pliny the Elder. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -This is a beer that I just say, """man I just really like drinking this stuff.""" Sometimes hard to explain why, but Lagunitas just gets it with this beer. Great transition between bitter, sweet, balance, smell, everything. One of my favorite DIPAS."

"While it may not be the best IPA I've had, it's certainly good enough that I'll be picking up more when I see it. An assertive tasty hop treat that deserves more of my time."
"O-It's actually not a very well balanced IPA IMO (not a lot of malt flavors), but oddly enough I still love this IPA because I think the hop profile is SPOT on."
"o: not too impressed. won't give up on or bad mouth lagunitas, this just isn't my cup of tea."
"O - this is really one of the best beers Lagunitas has made that I've had the pleasure of trying; it's an extremely well-done DIPA with balance, flavor, and the perfect amount of booziness; for your value, a beer doesn't get much better than this"
"D - It's not what I expected given the brewery. It is very drinkable and balanced, with little palate fatigue. Easy recommendation, although I'm a year late to this party."
""
""
""

"O: Great beer in that range between regular American IPAs and the stronger DIPAs. Definite characteristics consistent with other Laguntias beers (good in my book)."

"I've always heard a lot of buzz about this but didn't actually know anything about other than it was supposed to be good. So in essence walked out of the store with absolutely no idea what I had bought. Thought it was a bit light when I started to pour and was a bit disappointed as I wasn't in the mood for something subtle. First wiff immediately alleviated my disappointment. Tons of hop character in the nose, predominately citrus tones with some tropical fruits. Taste is what a hop bomb should always be, tons of hop flavor and bitterness but not overdone. Citrusy hops are front and center again with a buttery malt sweetness holding it all together. Mouthfeel is about what you would expect for the style and the alcohol is well hidden. Always happy to try a beer that actually lives p to then hype."

"I really, really liked this beer. Nice and smooth and would love to have it again. Well done Lagunitas."

"Well worth the anticipation and hype. Glad I grabbed two six-packs of sucks at the LQ. Highly recommended, especially @ $2.50/12oz."

"Overall I was really surprised at how much I liked this. Very rich and balanced and easily clearing the bar of a world class double ipa. Really hard to believe this is only $9 a six pack, will definitely be stocking up on this on my next trip to total wine"
"I think I liked this one better last year, but I did get a whole case. Let's see how my taste buds react next time."
""
"Just a fantastic brew. It's not quite big or complex enough to justify the DIPA style, but a wonderful beer nonetheless. Not necessarily sessionable at this ABV, but I could kill a six pack in a couple hours with buddies. God, I hope they make this year-round."
"O: Lagunitas nailed it. While I don't really love their standard IPA, Maximus and Sucks stand out to me. They shine on the shelf full of IPAs. Do yourself a favor and try this beer, it's excellent."

"lagunitas sucks pours a really nice polished gold color. it has a small amount of white head, with a nice looking lace. the smell is heavy with grapefruit and piney citrus, i almost think if you didnt know you were smelling beer you would think this was grapefruit juice. this beer is really hoppy and piney, very bitter. this flavor encompasses your whole mouth. the right amount of carbonation makes this not hard to drink if you can handle a solid ipa like this. honestly this is one of the best ipa's that i think ive ever had."

"Cheers!"
"This is like the opposite of Lagunitas- while Maximus is syrupy this one is bone dry. Can't tell which one I like more."
"O-This is the best beer I've had from Lagunitas. An excellent DIPA that I will enjoy again and again. A job well done!"
""
""
"O- this is another excellent offering from lagunitas. They can do no wrong in my eyes. Just a really solid, well balanced DIPA. To have this as a seasonal right after brown shugga is a great thing."
"Overall: An absolutely fantastic example of a true to form West Coast IPA. Definitely straddles the line between an IPA and a Double IPA. I feel its closer to a well-hopped single IPA than a double, personally. I cannot recommend this beer more highly. I would definitely put this beer next to my other all time favorite single IPAs (Sculpin and Blind Pig). If you see this, buy it immediately. Truly is an amazing beer. Lagunitas desperately needs to make this a year round offering."
""
"Raul straight doez this!"
""
"Having never have had this before I was a bit cautious with all the hype surrounding this release. The first thing I notice is the appearance of this beer, its a beautiful pale orange with a half inch cap that is off white. The nose is great, everything I look for in a well made DIPA, dank, sweet, floral, and fruity. The flavor profile is mango, oranges and molasses with a bitter beam of hops to balance the brew out, very well done, the beer gives up more complexity as it warms in my tulip. The mouth is fine, not to oily and not to dry, the finish though dissipates rather quickly. Overall I think this is a very well made beer from a very well respected producer that I will gladly seek out again."
"Really like the smell of this beer, fresh and full of that hop aroma that just got harvested. Light mouthfeel, sweet but dry finish. Alcohol level hides well under this incredible smell, one of their best beers and could become one of my favorites of all time IPA's"
"Overall: This is a solid brew…very citrus hops heavy with a solid malt backbone and a piney hops finish…very flavorful…I’m not sure how this is an afterthought brew for lagunitas because it’s better than most others’ IPA attempts…a wonderful surprise I found at my local Dominick’s that I couldn’t pass up, and I’m super glad I didn’t…if you see this brew, buy it and you’ll thank me later...outstanding flavor with a high ABV (that’s only noticeable by the buzz), this is a stand-out beer that I couldn’t recommend more…(4.5/5)"
"O: A+ (Please, please don't go year round with bombers!)"
"Overall I absolutely love this beer, and love the fact that it is on the cheaper side. This is definitely going to be one of my go-to beers going forward. YUM."

"A really well made beer from Lagunitas, even if a bit more tropical fruit would have been appreciated to better handle the bucketload of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Ultimately, I enjoyed the bottle I had of this beer last year as opposed to the uber fresh draft version I had at Apex."
""
"D - one very tasty beer!"
""
""
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a dense soapy head that settles to a thin haze, leaving lots of soapy lacing. Lovely aromas of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and pine resin. Taste is similarly tropical, with lots of fresh hop flavors and a moderately bitter finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and slightly sticky, with a medium body and ample carbonation. Really excellent DIPA, glad I finally got to try it (missed out all last year)."

"Lagunitas Sucks pours a cloudy yellow-amber with a one-finger white head. Scent is tropical: tons of peaches and mangoes, as well as pine and earthy, citrus hops. Taste is lemon and red grapefruit with a cereal malt backbone. Very well balanced. Palate is medium, with a creamy texture and lively carbonation. Overall a great offering from Lagunitas that should be year-round. Bottled 12/17/12. Rated 12/22/12"

"O: not much of a fan of Lagunitas, but man did they produce one phenomenal brew here. On tap it was absolutely amazing. just an absolutely terrific representation of the style. and the drinkability is awesome too. could easily kick a 6er of this back in a sitting."

"Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation. Finishes up well with some more of that piney hoppiness. A lot of excellent flavors going on here. Although classified as a DIPA, I find it extremely drinkable and at only 7.85% ABV isn't too heavy either. It's right in the middle ground of pretty heavy IPA and a light DIPA. I like this so-called """middle-ground", great balance of flavors going on here."

"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine hoppy notes with light caramelized sugar notes. Taste is also a good mix between some caramelized sugar notes with a heavy dose of citrus and piney hops. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Lagunitas is master in brewing this type of beer and this one doesn’t disappoint."

"O- The first thing that I noticed was the aroma during the pour from about 2 feet away. One of only a few beers I can remember smelling during the pour. Definitely a solid above average beer. I hope they don't leave this as a one-off as I think this is much better than their IPA but I have not yet had their Hop Stoopid to compare."
""
"Very piney and oily nose. Lots of hops on there. Flavor carries hearty and syrupy hop character. I think that's what really defines this one: thick and syrupy. It's a good ale as it's consistent and well done and very Lagunitas in execution. Worth trying."

"O - Holy Lord is it good! This is the beer that made me realize the boys in Petaluma know what the F they're doing. I'd only tried their IPA before buying this, and since have tried everything they put out. Thank you Sucks, for opening my world up to the glory of Lagunitas. I am forever indebted."
""
""
"This reminded me of Two Hearted a lot. The malt is similar to TH, but it has more meat on its bones. I was expecting the hops to play a bigger role and I feel that the malt was a bit too thick and overpowering for my taste. Good, but I didn't go bananas over it. Also, it doesn't really profile as a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lagunitas had no choice but to release this marvelous beer after the Brown Shugga fiasco. It is delicious."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most was the nose and the evenness of taste. The aromatics were bold and bright, and the fruitiness, mixed with the hops, added freshness. The taste followed suit, but the bitterness of the hops tended to drown out the other flavors. Finally, if we must gripe, the coloring was a little light for our preference, but this was made up for greatly by the beautiful carbonation and head, and the following retention. This all lead to a fantastic fell and slurp, making this beer great from every angle."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I recently had a fresher sample, and it was phenomenal. Those tropical fruit hops are much more pronounced. This beer fresh is one of the better DIPAs that I’ve had. It is loaded with hops, yet very, very drinkable. This is one tasty beer. Do yourself a favor and get this one fresh while you can."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied, with ample carbonation to keep this moving along the palate. The result is a beer that foams up in the mouth, creating a fairly creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Finish is quite dry and slightly sticky from the extra malt sweetness to balance this out."

"Poured into an imperial pint. Color was a medium dark amber, with a 2 finger white head. Head dissipated to a thin layer, and didn't cling at all. Aroma was slightly sweet, with a fair bit of hops. Flavor was a strange hybrid between an IPA and a winter warmer. Started off nicely sweet, then had a bit of spice, before finishing up with a solid mouthful of hops. Felt great in the mouth. Coated very nicely, and still finished with a bit of carbonated kick. Overall a strong beer."
"Fruity and sweet with a strong malt character. Sharp, piney hops next, then caramel. Boozy as things finish up, ends a little sweet with honey & hop flavors lingering. Body is thick and creamy. An enjoyable brew."

One day during batting practice, Pipp took a pitch to the temple and had his skull fractured. The team's Manager had to turn to his young back-up to replace Pipp as the starter. That young 1st baseman? Lou Gehrig. This beer is Lou Gehrig. While Brown Shugga' is a good beer it's """substitute", Lagunitas Sucks, is on it's way to becoming a legend. This is the best beer I've ever had from Lagunitas, and that's saying a lot. Let's hope they keep this beer in the game."

"O: Great beer, I think I like Hop Stoopid more though. I take that back, I def like Hop Stoopid more. I think this was a little bit of a hype baby. Still a really good beer but to go from nothing to being there number 1 rated beer seems a little bit much."

"O - Again, this is very balanced, super enjoyable. It reminds me a little bit of Lagunitas Dogtown pale ale, but a little beefier. Dogtown is one of my favorite pale ales, so Sucks could become a staple drinker for me. I thought Brown Shugga was a terrible beer, so I'm loving that they're making this instead."
"Thanks Preismj for the extra!"

"Very nice and quite typical of a heavy-handed hop bomb from California. For style, it goes down dangerously smooth so use caution. I'd personally like to give this a run with lamb tacos doused in a lambic vinagrette -- the sweet, robust meaty flavor of the tacos would be be able to cut through the assertive hops used in this bad boy."
"Deep yellow in color with a orange hue and a slight haze. Poured with a strong, rocky white head that left behind a rich cap and ample sticky lacings. Intense floral and ripe citrus hop aromas with a hint of pine and malt beneath. Smooth and pleasant feel with ample carbonation. Floral and citrus grapefruit hop flavors in the beginning with a brief taste of sweet malt. Finishes cleanly with a citrus orange and pine hop flavor that fades with a bit of alcoholic heat. Nice variety of hop flavors and a nice clean finish without too much bitter aftertaste."

"D: This was a flat out fantastic beer. The scent was one of the best IPAs I can remember, and the taste wasn't far behind. Simple but super delicious. The body was only ok, which was the only real area of weakness, but the alcohol was well hidden. So it was pretty easy to drink, as long as you like hops. I need to try this beside HopSlam or another top IPA, maybe blind, just to see. I really hope they bring this back next year - I much prefer it over Brown Shugga. Highly recommended."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 364th of 2011. Pours a bright clear orange yellow with a one fluffy white head, with layers lace. Smell is huge citrus, tangerine, passion fruit, peach, grass, marijuana, and pineapple. Taste is tons of citrus with a marijuana and grapefruit in the finish. Body large for the style, perfect amount life, lush not dry, and so drinkable. This is tremendous, but so isn't Brown Shugga."
""
"Postscript: I was able to obtain 3 more 6'rs and at well over 3 months since its bottled date, the hop aroma and flavor is just as brillant...amazing!"
""
"Large bubble size of carbonation and golden-yellow color nearly hint at a lager of some kind, or a pale. Most IPAs (the stronger American sort I favor) normally seem to run much more toward the coppery end of the spectrum, so I was surprised upon decanting. The smell is similar to the stand-by Lagunitas IPA, with a hint of something...different. One taste revels that difference in its full glory. While a very similar hop profile to Lagunitas IPA, this brew has a wonderful clear hoppiness and strong, lingering tones of tropical fruits, notably pineapple. More rich citrus flavor than the IPA as well. Vaguely tacky to the palate, yet still fairly drinkable, which is well-motivated by the delicious flavors. This could be my favorite offering yet from Lagunitas."
"O- good beer that I am glad I finally got my hands on. Wouldn't mind having it again. Hopefully though I could get it a little sooner though but it seemed to live up to the expectations."

"Can anything good come from California? Apparently so. The Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale is a delightful winter warmer. Nice head, lacing and color (amber with tiny tiny bubbles, Good natual carboation always imbues tiny bubbles versus the big obnoxious bubbles). The smell is tempting like dessert after a good steak. the taste is sweet, like bananas and horehound candy...not sickeningly sweet...just alluringly so. Hop-sense is balanced. The mouthfeel is complete and satisfying, like french kissing for the first time. Overall...a VERY satisfying ale. WAY better than I expected. Don't get your nose up in the air though...the Northwest micros still rule."

"O - I'm very glad I had the chance to get a 6-pack of this popular beer. It had a great tropical hop profile, was nice and smooth, and was super drinkable. Because it's pretty light for a DIPA, I had no problem having a few in succession. I think I'm in the majority opinion in that Lagunitas should really think about bringing this beer back for next year."

"The color is a clear straw yellow with orange hints and a fluffy white head about two fingers thick. The aroma can best be described as a mix of tropical fruit, pineapple, papaya, peach, and citrus with hints of pine. The aroma was complex, but could have been more defined. The taste consisted of pine, citrus, and peach. The hops provide a complex flavor profile. The carbonation is at about a medium level with a dry lingering finish. Very good beer! This is the first beer I have tried from Lagunitas--very impressed!"

"O: A lot of flavor going on here with this beer. So drinkable for nearly 8%. Hope they bring this back next year or even make it a year round offering."

"Overall a very nice hop driven bomb that was surprisingly in balance."
"Sidenote: my friend had a Avery Maharaja while I was drinking this. Alternating sips of the beers (right in a row, that is) created one of the most sublime beer experiences I can remember, a hop VOYAGE. Very oddly specific, but if you ever have these two beers or see them both on tap somewhere, do it. You will thank me."
""

"O - I do like the Lagunitas hops, so this was a treat for me. Simple and smooth makes this a wonderful beer that I would rather have over brown shugga (sorry)."

""
"a pretty good DIPA thats not too overpowering, but plenty flavorful. I actually like it better than the beer it """temporarily""" replaced. I bet this is not the last we see of this beer."
"O- A solid DIPA from Lagunitas. Prefer the more tropical hop nose of the Little Sumpin' Sumpin', but this is a good beer. Not totally outstanding, but I would buy it again."
"Sucks does not. A terrific IPA."
"O: A Super tasty IPA, give it a shot before it's gone."
""
""
""
"O: This is close to Lil Sumpin Sumpin but with a bit more of a hop kick. I'm not sure I'd call it a DIPA but it's one tasty beer. I will definitely be back for more."
""
""
""

""
"This is quite possibly the best thing I've tasted from Lagunitas, and one of the best double IPAs I've had in recent memory. Seriously. If this becomes a seasonal, I will definitely be buying a bunch of this every year."

""
""
""

"This beer goes down far more easily than I initially expected from its hoppy scent. I just wish I'd bought more bottles, as I could drink this all night."
""
"O- outstanding beer. Great flavor. I would mostly think of holiday ales as being closer to a brown ale, but this is incredibly well balanced for a double ipa."
""
""
""
"O-- Awesome beer, they should brew it year round! Brown Shugga is a good seasonal, but this blows it away!"
"overall, this is a very nice beer. Great flavor and aroma, good mouthfeel. Real happy to have tried this one. Thanks Milo"
""
""
"D - Not real drinkable. Very hoppy to the point that it overtakes the beer."

""
""
"O - One of the best double IPA's i've had in a long time. Unfortunately, this came out right around the time as Surly Abrasive ale. I was overloaded on IPA's for a month. While i prefer Abrasive over this, it's still one of the better beers i've had lately. Lagunitas hit a home run with this brew."
"Overall, a really nice IPA and another great offering from Lagunitas. The hop notes are nice and complex throughout. Not quite the best IPA around, but still very good."
""
"Lagunitas, you don't suck. You rock. This is delicious. Keep 'em coming."

"Overall: Amazing. Lagunitas Sucks most certainly does not suck. In fact it is one of the greatest IPAs I have ever encountered."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is creamy coming off a bit of crispness in a medium body with moderate carbonation. the body holds it all together well."
"O: Well above average, quality Double IPA, I'll probably go see if I can get another sixer to share some"
"Great beer. They should make this again. Reminds me of hop stoopid for some reason. Maybe they use a certain type of hop... Love the sticky, tropical hops they use. Didn't want to rate it so high, I just can't find anything wrong with it. Lagunitas doesn't suck."
"O: wish I'd bought a sixer"
"Overall - Great IPA. Not really Pliny quality, but a great IPA. The nose is just a touch muted and the bitterness isn't quite balanced, but I'm being picky when I criticize this beer."
""
""
""
"O: An interesting choice to substitute a well-hopped DIPA for the maltier deliciousness of annual favorite Brown Shugga'... but nothing disappointing about the results. It's Lagunitas at their best, making a flavorful and approachable ale that I, even as a malt-preferer, enjoyed enough to hope for an encore next year."
""
"Glad I finally got to try this beer. The color is a clear straw yellow with orange hints and a fluffy white head about two fingers thick. The aroma can best be described as a mix of tropical fruit, pineapple, papaya, peach, and citrus with hints of pine. The aroma was complex, but could have been more defined. The taste consisted of pine, citrus, and peach. There is not a noticeable malt backing, but I think it works for this beer since the hops provide a complex flavor profile. The carbonation is at about a medium level with a dry lingering finish. Great beer! This is one of the reasons that I love Lagunitas."
"O- Well done. Probably my favorite Lagunitas beer in the six pack variety. Hop Stoopid is still my favorite."
""
""
"Overall (4.5): Outstanding Strong IPA (what I’m calling those IPA-like beers between 6.5-8.5% or so, bigger than an IPA and smaller than a DIPA). This has to be one of the best beers in the IPA spectrum right now! Despite being so hoppy, this is drinkable as hell, like it’s taunting you in a lupulin threshold shift. Well, Lagunitas, your ploy worked. I want more—a lot more."
"Is it better than Brown Shugga? Well...they're completely different beers. I haven't had Brown Shugga in a few years, but I have fond memories of drinking it on tap. I think they should release both ;)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Already beer fans who've gotten over the absence of Brown Shugga are calling for this to made regularly, or at least, again, and if I remember what I've glanced at, they're doing it. And so, perhaps there's need for a new designation, the 1 1/2 IPA, the ducal IPA, the 8% versus the 10%, for peeps for whom 6% and hoppy is not enough. I've met them. I can't say I respect them. Those who disdain anything sessionable, but don't want to get drunk after two."
"O: Lagunitas sucks just plain ROCKS. This DIPA is amazing. I want more."
"O: Big complex hop flavors & aroma. Can't really pick up any malt flavors, since the hops are so over the top here. Yet another great IPA from Lagunitas."
"O: Unique, special, very interesting. I don't love it, but it's certainly really great."
"overall - superb DIPA. Powerful yet very pleasant and easy to drink. Excellent aftertaste. Well worth seeking out ... no apologies (even tongue in cheek) needed, Lagunitas!"
""
"O: I haven't had the Brown Shugga this was brewed to replace, but this is a good offering. Complex, sweet and drinkable with a dry finish. I had three last night and couldn't have been happier."
""
"appearance is more straw colored and transp. than orange like i'da guessed... head is minimal, lacing is considerable, nose is abound with floral hops even a sweetness about it possibly some citrus smell but not dominant.. taste is crispy, lightly carbonated on the mouthfeel, floral hoppy prescense with some light citrus notes.. again, much like the smell, overall, this brew is something special, comparable to a few of my favorites, going to try and track down some more before it disappears"
""
"Overall: I could drink this all day. A very enjoyable beer from an amazing brewery! I love visiting this place, they have a long list of GREAT brews that never make it to retail shelves. It would be great if they produced this one year round."
"Low to medium body with soft carbonation, slick and oily on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink for a bitter hop bomb on the tongue, though a little more aroma would make this even better. But for the price, it cannot be beat."
"Update March 2013...raised appearance score. This time the head was plentiful with great retention and lots of lacing. Taste was still a huge citrus hop bomb - bitter but still very drinkable. Also raised overall score."
"overall - amazing double IPA, very pleasant, very easy to drink, would love to sip on it all day if it weren't nearly 8%"

"O: One hell of a unique imperial IPA. The hops don't seem to break 80 but I could be wrong (found it to be under 70). A delicious delicious summer IPA brewed in winter. I have to grab some to safe guard for hot summer nights. Lagunitas impresses once again!"
"Overall, a very good version of the style. Despite the harsh, biting bitterness of the piney hops there is some balance of malt and thats what makes this so good. Not a very heavy beer either so I think I might be able to drink a few at a time when I'm in the mood for something hoppy."
""
""
""
"Beer has slight head retention with nice lacing around the glass. The smell however is remarkable - extremely fruity, citrusy with hints of pine and orange. The smell is crisp and extremely clean. The taste mimicks the smell. I enjoy a beer with a clean malt bill that lets the hops dominate. If you're looking for a nutty or malty bill this may disappoint on that front. The hops follow the smell with grapefruit, slight mint, and lemon with a balanced bitter finish. The overall mouthfeel does have a resiny oil like finish but nothing that would be considered offensive. Overall this is an exceptional beer for my style if you enjoy a clean, citrus type beer."
""
""
""
"Fresh hop aroma, balanced, and very flavorful this beer has it all. Deceptively simple yet it showcases big flavor and is refreshingly addictive. Not a big bold hoppy beer like usual but has wonderful hop elements focusing on flavor rather than bitterness."
""
"O: Really good, if this is a substitute for Brown Shugga’ I guess I need to try Brown Shugga. I still don't think this beer is world class, but it's for sure another great Lagunita's brew."
"Had this year's batch and it's as good as ever. My favorite IPA."
"O: Lagunitas needs to screw up more. This is a fantastic Imperial IPA. Need to buy more while I still can."
"at long last i get round to this baby. 12 oz single from Fred Meyer, S.Salem $1.67 Clear orange body to the ale with a nice half inch sized white frothy head. Big strong,dank,heavy resiny hop aromas,herbal Again heavy hop taste but very well matched by the bready,caramel maltiness, but bright citric,lemon zest hops dominate in the end. Good on the palate keeps this heavy brew moving Another Lagunitas classic..to me though this is more a DIPA than an ASA"
""
"MO-Low carbonation. Another winner from these guys. There beers are among the most interesting reasonably prices beers around."
"O-an excellent DIPA with great flavor and good balance"
""
"Final verdict - this is a good to very-good beer, but honestly, I don't see what all the nattering is about regarding Sucks. It's a good IPA/DIPA, but there are better ones out there. Not to mention this is like the 758th DIPA Lagunitas has made. That said, the price point on this is outstanding, it's a good value buy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Rating goes up here because this is SO ridiculously drinkable. If I didn’t hav to worry about a beer belly, I would pound a sixer of this (wait, I did pound a growler!). Refreshing, flavorful, easy-but-complex… very damn nice, and the bottled version is best."
"Fantastic beer and much better than the seasonals it replaces. As far as Lagunitas beers only Hop Stoopid comes close to matching this. Easy drinking and goes down way too smooth at this ABV."
""
"Overall, it doesn't completely replace Brown Shugga', but it is a good beer. A little lacking in the balance, but it could definitely be worse; at least its full of delicious hop flavors. I would buy this again if they decide to re-release it."
"O: This was a very welcome surprise. I've heard some talk about this one being sort of an apology for Brown Shugga not being available. Let me be the first (I'm probably not) to say this: BREW THIS YEAR ROUND! I'd buy this by the case. One of the single best hoppy beers I've had to date, and it's from a brewery that makes a hoppy beer I hate (Hop Stoopid). They got this one very, very, very right. Highly recommended."
"Glad I didn't miss out on this excellent IPA. Definitely in the same mold as Hop Stoopid and Lil Sumpin, and this one might even be better as it seems more refined. Drink fresh!"
""
""
"This beer looks pretty good but smells amazing. The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell but this beer is still amazing. I hop Lagunitas turns this into a year round because it blew me away. The mouthfeel isn't bad leaves some bitterness on the tongue but in a good way. If you see this beer get it now!"
"If this ever actually does become a year-round beer, I'll be a very happy man. As drinkable as an 8% IPA gets and packed with flavor."
"O - A truly excellent beer! I am a huge fan of surly abrasive, but I think this tops it. Abrasive is a bit extreme in the alcohol content, so it's not as drinkable as this. I had been reading the reviews of this beer and thinking it's exactly my type of beer, and it sure didn't disappoint. An excellent job by Lagunitas, and should I say, far better than the beer it replaced."
"Notes: I realize that this is just a stand-in for Brown Shugga', but come on Lagunitas. Get a little creative. Brew me something besides a mash-up of every other IPA you've ever done. Not what I'm looking for in the dead of winter either. Poor choice for a winter seasonal, even if it is temporary. Lagunitas sucks. (insert smiley emoticon here)"

"A cellar temperature bottle is poured into a pint glass. It's a clear, copper colored beer. There's plenty of visible carbonation, but not much head, just a skim of tan foam. It has abig, hoppy aroma that has a good amount of citrus. The flavor is fairly bitter, but not as strong as some DIPAs I've had. It has a good citrus flavor and some bitter hop oils that linger after I swallow. It's a full bodied beer, but the coat isn't too big. It does leave my lips a little sticky. It's a tasty beer, but not one I'll miss if they decide not to brew it again."
"Crazy hop forward beer, this one, but very drinkable and likeable."
""
""
"It reminds me of Surly Abrasive. I don't like the tomato summity flavor but other than that it is a good one."
""
"O – I really liked this Holiday offering. If they brewed it again I would definitely try to score some more."
"12oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Pours a translucent orange-gold with a loose, fluffy, 3/4 inch bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a bull's eye dollop with spots and thin strands of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass. Great nose on this beer - candied citrus fruit (grapefruit), herbal/piny hops, a slight onion and pepper character. Upfront flavors are predominantly piny resin and citrus rind. Middle is light, toasted malts and finish re-asserts the faint onion character in the nose with a light, lingering earthy bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an assertive carbonation that leaves a residual prickle across the tongue. There's also a light oiliness and a little bit of acidity. Overall, a very good DIPA with an ABV that isn't over the top. I'm pretty happy about Lagunitas' """screw-up.""" I hope to try this one on draft before it disappears."
""
""
""
"Overall - I really love this beer. I know its kind of getting overhyped on here, but it really lives up to expectations. I will say though that it fits a particular style for IPA/DIPAS - you have to like the citrusy, slick, and clean tasting IPAs. If you want something with a bit more malt balance, you may be a bit disappointed. It does seem like this type of DIPA is currently in vogue and therefore it gets high ratings. I love it personally."
""
"O - This is a really tasty Imperial IPA. I'm glad Sanford at Sycamore was able to get some at his bar."
""
""
"O- Another great beer by Lagunitas! Glas they repacked it as """Leftovers""" Love the IPAs now can't wait for Brown Shugga!"
"O – A hop heads dream. It’s as close to Pliny as you can get with a national distribution. I’m going to be so disappointed when this release is over."
""
""
"Overall, this beer is much better than it was the last time I had it. It is absolutely amazing. I love it and will drink as much of it as possible over the next few weeks. Lagunitas is an amazing brewery."
"Overall, this beer is intriguing. I think it's honestly completely over rated (as are most fanboy beers on this website) but it's not a drain pour. I'll finish this sixxer, but I don't see the appeal."
""
""
""
"O - Oerall this is a fine beer indeed. I put it up there with Lil Sumpin' Sumpin'. This is a beer I would buy constantly if I could get my hands on it. Great work, you certainly don't suck."
"I especially like hop masterpieces made with house produced hop extracts of high quality. Lagunitas has it down with Hop Stoopid, Maximus, and others, and now this one, all are easy drinking, delicious."
""
""
"O: Well, this was a sleeper for sure. Great combination of hoppiness and balanced almost perfectly at the same time. A rare combination that just """works""". Drinkable as can be too, nice and smooth, not too harsh or drying like a lot of DIPAs can be."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Each sip follows easily from the last and I’d be happy to have another. This is a good workmanlike beer from Lagunitas, good but not outstanding, but still worth having more than once."

"O- This is a winner. I am not as high on Lagunitas as some, but was impressed with this particular one. Another winner from the West Coast. They sure know how to do their IPAs. Im glad my buddy got me to try it."

"Overall this is a great IPA and, I think, obviously superior to the other ipa's that lagunitas brews despite being at about the same price point. I like brown shugga (and, for that matter, all of the relatively similar """strong ales""" that lagunitas puts out) but I hope they find a way to make this beer a mainstay so that I can add it to my IPA roation with Hop Notch and 2hearted."
""
"Sucks pours with a half inch of nice white head that recedes to a film. There is a bit of lacing on the glass. Bright and clear, golden colored. Aroma is fresh and citrusey, with a mild tropical note and a touch of caramel. Juicy grapefruit is the dominant aroma. The beer has more of a tropical taste with pineapple and mango with a bit of the grapefruit. Not a lot of bitterness, but very well balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit fuller than I would have liked, I generally like a drier IPA, but still very nice. With a touch more dryness this beer could be world class."
""

"Overall this doesn't quite live up to some of the draft-only specialties Lagunitas did last year (Waldos, SF Fusion), but it's a damn good beer and an outstanding value."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. It leaves the bottle a transparent yellow orang in color and leaves 3/4""" of nice white head that recedes to a fine white ring. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit. Bang... Powww... Zort!!! This is so good! This has big time citrus, tropical, and pine flavors. This tastes like founders harvest on roids. I can't taste the heat at all. Dangerously drinkable. Great carbonation. They must use a centrifuge on this because it is about as clear as any beer I've ever seen. Great stuff."

"overall a very good beer."

"This truly is one of the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. It is crisp and clean, light but full flavored. Absolutely fabulous."
"O-excellent beer with great balance and flavor. This holiday brew did not dissapoint"
"O: Lagunitas Sucks is a nice little beer. But it's waaayyy overhyped. Beer of the year? Are you off your fucking rocker? It taste like a rip off of Columbus' IPA, with a bit more body and that patented Lagunitas flavor profile. Would I have it again? Yeah...sure I would. But I've had better."
""
"This beer is a winner. I prefer this to the Brown Shugga'. This should be the new winter seasonal."
"If you like fruit forward hop character, you'll be hard pressed to find a better example."
""
"Pours a bright and clear gold, moderate cap of white froth, great rings of lacing. Scent leads with piney, resinous hops, can smell the Lagunitas from the first whiff, fruity notes of tropical and citrus come through, light spiciness, little in the way of malt sweetness. Taste reverses the scent and is more tropical and citrus forward, ample juicy and bitter grapefruit with touches of pineapple and orange. Decent resiny pine profile and faint splash of sweetness. Dry finish, a tad on the thinner side of medium bodied, more heft would be welcomed. Overall, been waiting to try this and it dint disappoint, a great tasting dIPA."
""
"Overall-Solid DIPA-with great hop aroma and flavor, but somewhat lacking in the malt department. Still, Lagunitas always does a good job with their hops, and this is no exception."
"Overall: Thoroughly enjoyable. I wish it was Brown Shugga, but Lagunitas clearly didn't half-ass the replacement. Quite a bit like their 'Sumpin 'Sumpin ale."
""
"This isn't the most complex beer I've had, but it may be the best hop flavor. They just nailed the heck out of that. It's a bit light for an IIPA, but it seems to be exactly right for this beer. I'd keep this in my fridge at all times if I had the capability."
"Of the dozen or so winter releases I've had this year, so far the Lagunitas Sucks is my favorite. Which, quite frankly, surprises me because I've said time and time again that """I am not a hop-head.""" Maybe I'm slowly developing a taste for that bitterness all you IPA-lovers crave? Nah, I doubt it."
"Bottle. Heard a lot about this and seemed right to be drank on New Years Ever. Pours a light medium colored copper color with a thick white head. Nice head retention. Some lace. Nice citrus aroma in the nose. Malty backbone with a nice citrus rind. NIce level of bitterness. Ends pretty crisply and cleanly with a minimal lingering bitterness. Dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear yellowy orange, with a big thick three finger head. The smell is almost heavenly. It's very citrusy and piney. I really love the smell of this beer. Could smell it all day long. The taste is great too, though not as good as the aroma. The taste is very hoppy. It's a nice oily hop bite that starts if off. The bite wears off quickly and leaves a hoppy after taste that hangs around for quite some time. I almost think the after taste is just a touch off and actually detracts from the overall score for the beer (IMO). This is a great IPA. I really wish it was available year round."
""
""
""
""
"This beer blew me away on New Year’s Eve having it on tap, and it’s still impressing me now out of the bottle. It’s definitely better in draft form, but either way you have it, it’s an “A” beer for sure. I can’t say I like it more than Celebration Ale, but I will say I will look forward to its release next year as much as I do for Celebration’s."
"Overall this is another tasty DIPA in an ocean of hoppy ales. I have never had Brown Shugga, so I can't speak on if this is a legitimate substitute, but it is a damn fine brew. Cheers!"
""

"O- An excellent DIPA, the flavors are amazing, I almost feel like I'm stealing given that I paid around $10 for a six pack, I haven't had Brown Shugga before (I'll have to try it now) but no apologies are needed for this beer."
"(rating based on a $20 max)"
"Overall, this is a terrific beer. Maybe my favorite IIPA. Definately one of the best noses on a beer that I have encountered so far."
"Final Thought. I drank Ruination to be punished, Ghandibot to be impressed, but Sucks is now my benchmark. Fuck Brown Shuggha."
"O- Excellent dipa, as much as I love Brown Shugga this is a worthy replacement."
"round 2 2013, I love this, great lacing, crazy aroma, session-able."
""
"Pours a golden tigers eye color with a nice 1.5 finger head on it. The nose is a blast of hops - dank citrus, earthy hops explode out of this. Very aromatic and inviting. The taste follows suit with a barrage of hops on the tongue. Citrus, pine, some earthy onions and dirt. Really nice flavor profile. Mouth is medium body with decent carbonation. Really solid DIPA. This one runs with Pliny and hopsslam as one of the tops in this style. Given the price point and availability this is a no brainier."
"***Getting it here in NH (February 2013) @ 11.99/sixer @ Johnsons Market Place***"
"This is so well balanced that I may have to reduce my rating on my Hopslam review. This Lagunitas Sucks is way more drinkable and that really Sucks because I will probably have to finish the growler tonight. This is a must try if you are a fan of IPA's!!! Way to go Lagunitas."

"Highly recommended!"

""
""
""

"O- This beer has a lot going for it, most notably the aroma, but it comes up a bit short on some fronts. That being said, this is a very tasty beer and I would gladly have another."

"I've never had Brown Shugga', or any other IPA aside from Hop Stoopid, but this is definitely a good one."
""
"Overall, this is one damn good IPA. As a Double IPA? Not so much. But as a regular ol' IPA this is a beer that Lagunitas should consider brewing more regularly. A damn fine achievement."
"D - Nicely done, a very fruity IPA. The malt stays in the background, allowing the hops to shine through despite the relatively low bitterness."
"Single finger head on a clear golden with very mild crimson hues body, head is white with tons of lacing. The aroma is mostly grapefruit, tropical and light pine. The flavor is almost perfect with a very nice musty hop flavor with citrus, floral and piney hops with the right amount of each to make an excellent tasting beer. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This is an excellent beer. Very similar to their something wild, just not as citrusy and more booze."
""
"Love me some Lagunitas and was disappointed to here Brown Shugga (one of my all time fav's) wasn't being released, but a new beer should hold me over. Has the typical Lagunitas """flavor""" to it, which isn't bad, you can just tell their beers apart for some reason. For a double IPA, it's quite malty and reminds me a bit of their undercover shutdown moreso than a hop bomb. None the less, it's a delicious beer, super drinkable and smooth for the ABV, and packs plenty of malty goodness. It might not be Brown Shugga, but it does a pretty damn good job in it's place."
"O - This is a wierd holiday ale, but a beer that I like. Always a fan of DIPA's that are less hop foward."
""
""
"O- Very impressed with this beer and pleasantly surprised by it. I think this replaced brown shugga which is a beer I think we all would like to forget. Great job Lagunitas! Hope to see this beer every year!"
"O - Again, if you love hops you will most likely love this beer. Missing brown sugga this year, but thanks for the great DIPA!"
""
"O - Awesome beer, really liked it a ton. Great, unexpected, beer from Lagunitas. I like this beer much more than I like Pliny... yes that's right."
""
"Pours a fairly clear, light yellowish orange with a slight pearl white head. The tropical hop aroma is off the charts. Great, strong notes of peach, fresh juicy mango, pineapple and a touch of fresh pine to boot. Just a fantastic aroma. Taste isn't bad either. Sweet, fresh, juicy tropical hop flavors to start. Again highlighting the trio that is so noticeable in the aroma. Tarter grapefruit notes are next before a tongue tingling resiny pine hops finish this one off nicely. Just a fantastic DIPA with a top notch, juicy and mouth watering hop profile."
""
""
""
"Amber hue with big foamy head which quickly retreats, leaving tons of sticky lace. smell is of citrus, pine, pineapple and hints of earth. taste is hop forward but not overpowering. Extreme bitterness is met with a rush of wet hop flavor (tastes like a harvest hop beer)...floral and orange peel/kumquat. lips pucker, great carb. No dry finish here. Very drinkable. similar to harvest ale, but less hop forward, more bitterness and great west coast citrus style."
""
"O - No doubt that this is a super heavy hop forward DIPA. Enough sweetness, wring the flavor out of a shirt after a 5 mile run sweatiness, super tropical and piney hop flavors to make this an outstanding beer for a hop head. Don't quite get the comparisons to Pliny...maybe in its hop intensity, but I'd say that this is lacking a bit of subtlety that keeps this a tick below PtE. However, I'm gonna be really enjoying the remainder of the 6er I picked up today."
""
""
""
"Overall: If this is an apology beer, I accept Lagunitas' apology. Loads of flavor and another winter IPA that I hope makes it in to regular rotation. If I could lock down a case of this and Celebration every winter, it sure would makes things a lot easier. Let's hope it's not just a one-off."

"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and I have several more of these to crack open... I like the fact that the ABV is manageable and it isn't a 9% head cracker that you can only have a couple of..."
""
"O- I love Lagunitas and this is my new favorite Lagunitas beer. Going to be a go to beer for me while this is still available."
""
""
"A really masterfully crafted Winter IPA. I hope I can find another six-pack!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff, glad I came across some in my area after thinking it was long gone."
"Yes, it is definitely worthy of the praise it has been receiving, and I would gladly have this again."
"Tons of mango, grapefruit and guava notes in both smell and taste. Excellent offering by the guys and gals at Lagunitas. Please, do yourself a favor and search out this brew. Sorry for the short review, as I've been drinking these back to back to back."
""
"O - overall, a solid offeing from Lagunitas, and definitely a good beer for them to throw together for the holiday season. Would like to see this around each holiday. It has good flavor, is well-balaced, and isn't too heavy. In general, the main aspect i find lacking is that this Abbas a bit thin in the body."
"O - An outstanding hop bomb of a beer that is well worth 10 or 11 bucks for a six pack. The hop profile is incredible with low bitterness, just plenty of bright fruity hops. The level of booziness in the aftertaste is the only drawback on this one. Check it out!"
""
"Overall: A very good dipa especially for the price and availability to me. This one just lacked just a touch in the flavor department to make it a great dipa. Highly recommended"
""
"O - Fantastic name for this beer, and Lagunitas...you don't suck. For """screwing up this badly", as you suggest on the label, you've still obtained insanely high ratings for this beer. I do miss Brown Sugga', but this is a fantastic substitute that many breweries would strive and fail to obtain."
""
""
"definatly a good IPA, something i would buy again. id like to see this as a year round as well. one of the better lagunitas IPA's ive had."
""
"Got this as a gift from a buddy or else never would have tried it - this beer is fantastic, though. Have tried other Lagunitas (but not the """real""" Brown Shugga) but am really blown away by this one. Can't imagine Brown Shugga is better than this....they need to make it year-round. Get this while you can though - it's great."
""
"This is an awesome IPA. It's got great hop character and a light malt character. This is no Brown Shugga so I'm still a little disappointed, but I won't take it out on this beer. I love it!"
""
""
""
""
"Had this first at Fathead's in Southside of Pittsburgh - had previously bought some in bottles at D's in Monroeville. Knew if it was like Brown Shugga that I would dig it the most - correct. Alcohol burn more prominent in the bottle format but excellent both ways. Maybe my favorite DIPA - 2X is excellent as well. Two thumbs up for Lagunitas...and Happy New Year"
"Overall-- this is a great beer. I hope this becomes a year round brew from Lagunitas! Just delicious."
"Wow....I never realized that Sucks Holiday Ale could be so awesome!!! This beer is Zombie Dust on Steroids. The beer pours a golden clear copper with thin white head that is lacing quite nice. The smell is citra hops and subtle spice. The taste brings a great mixture of pine and citrus with enough malt to balance the beer which leaves a nice coating on the tongue....which Semco hops usually do nicely. The mouthfeel is a full body with good carbonation. Overall this is a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" O - not their best but it sure doesn't suck."
"This one pours a very light golden color that is very translucent. Almost no head and low visible carbonation. It is as far away from a christmas beer as I could imagine. Great aroma of mango, pineapple, pine and floral notes. The flavor is fantastic. Huge burst of tropical fruit followed by orange and some white pepper and a bitter finish. Great level of carbonation makes this dangerously easy to drink. I really like this beer, yeah Lagunitas sucks..."
""
"Overall: this is one excellent beer. An uninspired appearance is completely atoned for by being an awesome freaking beer."
""
"I gave this beer a little less than stellar reviews simply because it doesn't taste like a xmas beer. It is a nice IPA as these guys know so well how to brew. It is not a Holiday Ale. As far as I can tell this is their regular IPA in a different bottle. I have yet to have one of their beers that I didn't love.. however again this isn't categorized properly.. You guys might have pulled it off a bit better by adding some more color.. That said, keep up the good work!"
""
"O: I swear that if this beer was brewery release only and didn't have the distribution Lagunitas does, it would be getting oodles more hype than it currently does. This is one of the best IIPAs I've had and I'm excited that they're re-releasing it as Holiday Leftovers. BRAVO Lagunitas. Bravo."
""
""
"To start, I have not tried Lagunitas' Brown Sugar yet. I picked this up after reading a lot of hype about it. It is definitely an interesting beer; if someone told me it was a grapefruit lambic, I'd have believed it. I can't say it's a bad beer, the carbonation is good as is the color (nice golden yellow). If you haven't tried this yet, be prepared for a citrusy, hoppy, grapefruit flavor. I cannot say that I would try it again, but as it is the only year they will make it (supposedly), it was worth it."
""
""
"I have to admit, I went into this tasting a little biased against any brew that attempted to make up for the loss of my dear Shugga', but Sucks is bright, dank, sweet and drinkable. While Lagunitas may suck, the beer does not. Though Magee says it'll only be around around for this one year, the brew's been well-received even by the wrathful masses. I imagine it'll make an appearance under a different name someday soon."
"O: In spite of its facetious name, this is a fantastic, easy to like beer."
"If an ale of this quality drives its brewers to proclaim that they “freaking munch moldy donkey butt,” then what chance to the rest of us have? If it makes them feel better, I didn’t really miss the Shugga’ this year. The Lagunitas brewers, as a rule, always respond well to having to think on their feet. Let’s hope that 2012 throws them a couple more curveballs."
""
""
"If only they would make a """Wild""" version. This could use some Belgian extravagance. This is just too acidic to be totally enjoyable, in spite of the nice aromatics and clean flavor."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a finger of white head. The foam recedes leaving sticky lacing and a thin coaster. The nose is big citrusy hops. Orange and tangerine predominate with notes of pale malt in the background. Taste opens with bitter, citrusy hops. flavors of orange, pineapple and mango intertwine with a sugar cookie malt backbone. The finish is semi-dry with a lingering bitter aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. Overall this beer is proof that Lagunitas certainly does not suck. This is a very nice DIPA and I wish they would scrap Brown Shugga altogether and just make this from here on out. Recommended."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall I thought this was a pretty solid offering especially since I was not expecting much based on Heath's description of his experience and the dating of the bottle. I found myself presently surprised by this and unfortunately quite curious what this brew was like fresh out the gate. This offering pretty much sold me on the 7.5 - 8% abv range being a sweet spot for hoppy brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark orange color, tons of lacing and head. Smell of grapefruit pine, mild malt. Full, biting sort of mouth feel. Really good carbonation. Overall what I would expect from Lagunitas, another super solid, really fresh tasting beer, that is distinctive and also comfortable(if you have had them before), and goes down pretty easy for the high alcohol percentage. Glad I got to try this."
""
"O-Great beer for the holidays, many winter and holiday beers are too spiced for my taste, I love how this beers stays true to its brewery with some nice hoppy flavors shining through."
""
""
""
"It's ok Lagunitas, I don't think you suck."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear golden color with a white head; ample lacing. Heavy citrus aroma with light floral hops; fairly sweet. Grapefruit and pineapple sugary sweetness from the start and throughout over a light caramel malt body and a mild resin bitter finish. Fairly simple, a little sweet, a little boozy and medium bodied. Ok, so I don't get the love for this other than the price. It tastes like any other Lagunitas IPA, which I typically don't enjoy. Happy to drink this fresh, but I'm pretty sure my pint at Friscos cost more than a 6 pack of it does (so maybe that's why I'm...wait for it...bitter)."
"M: Medium carbonation, lightly syrupy, and a sweet hoppy finish."
"I am going to have to get some more. Can't wait to share the other bottle that I got."
"It grinds to a halt. You must have been dreaming again. You toss back the remainder of the golden nectar in your lace-covered glass, and grab your skis. It is a long way down."
"This is one of the best Double IPAs I've had. It reminds me of an all-Simcoe homebrew I made earlier this year."
""
"I’ll bet this beer drank great back in November but I wouldn’t know since Maryland didn’t get this beer in stock until just last week. It’s a shame to, as you could definitely feel the potential to but the age as really enabled those hops and alcohol to turn this into a warm, dry, piney, and bitter bomb of an IPA that wasn’t nearly as enjoyable as it should have been. Ah well, maybe we’ll get the Holiday Leftovers Ale in a more timely manner."
""
"Great beer."
""
"Merry Effen Christmas to me! Actually this one was loved by all I shared with. Definitely looking for more and/or the re-release."

"got this on tap at Deagan's in Lakewood Ohio. pours a nice orange/amber color with a little head. i LOVE me imperial ipa's and this one didnt disappoint. it hits you with hops, but that distinctive taste of an imperial finishes it off. lots of citrus, but not too bitter."
""
""
"O: One of my favorites. Glad I found it on tap. This baby is all about the hops, and is pretty unique in my opinion."
"Really don't think this is an imperial. Just had to get this of the bat. Now on with the review. This is an amazing brew. Nice color and carbonation. Crystal clear. Lots of carbonation. Fresh. Smell is nice; fruit, pineapple, orange, lemon, pine, a little close to most of the little sumpin' ales. Easy drinker. A great seasonal but overall with the release being winter the brown sugga' has a fuller and warmer feel. I would be happy to have this on the line up all year long. Great beer. But brown sugga' is better with the colder weather."
"Overall: a very nice Double IPA. Now I can understand all the good things people were talking about. I will be enjoying more of this in the future."
""
""

"overall - really enjoy this, the hop presence is excellent and the flavor profile shines on this"

"Sticky Icky Cali IPA, complexity added by emerging tropical fruit notes…believe it this is a might tasty and well worth seeking out hoppy brew. Well done"

"Lagunitas sucks holiday ale is a great Dipa. It has a beautiful smell of guava and it tastes like it smells. It has a clear amber appearance and has sticky syrupy mouthfeel. I grew up drinking Kerns guava juice and this beer has a very comforting effect on me. I am a big Pliny the Elder fan and Lagunitas does a wonderful job and I decided it is my second favorite DIPA after Pliny. I want Lagunitas to brew this beer year round and I am sure I am not the only person that wants that to happen. Since I have never had brown shugga this beer makes me want to call it Lagunitas rocks brown shugga permanent substitute. ( or at least that's what I am going to call it untill they rename it )"
""
""
"o: glad I was able to get obtain this. Solid 'mistake' by Lagunitas. Not overly hoppy - well balanced this. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended for IPA fans."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppy? You bet your mistletoe-adjacent ass it is. Bitter? Hardly at all - Scrooge himself seems to have wielded control over that particular item on this wish list. Anyways, a worthy mea culpa/marketing stunt, whatever, it's good, and way more approachable/poundable than I had been led to believe. Mom (she of the bitter beer face tendencies) said it wasn't bitter at all, and quite nice. Ah, it's a verily wonderful life...that's what's actually on the TV, so, well, that's enough for me right now, sigh."
"Theres no way they won't make this again. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is good. Is not heavy and does not linger long. Overall a very solid beer."
"Wow, heck of a DIPA for being sub-8%—though I tend to like my hop bombs on the lighter side. The aroma is rich with a mix of rye and grassy citrus. The flavor opens with juicy, floral hop notes and progresses back to the spicier, grassy pine of the aroma. The malts, unlike in most DIPAs, provide a distinct, dry bready undertone to amp up the complexity. I gotta say, I really prefer this to BrownShugga'. Grab this up if you can find any more. It's sort of like Southern Tier's 2XIPA, but with an extra kick of malty goodness."
""
""
"O- This beer does not suck, it is a really nice hoppy IIPA that is easy to drink. Very happy that it finally made its way to Maryland and I was able to get a six pack, definitely will pick up more if it is still around."
""
""
""
"I poured this aptly named beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The first thing of course I noticed was there was no head at all after a few minutes. The beer was a nice golden color and smelled hoppy. But the taste was just over the top hoppy. Like sticking a Christmas tree in your mouth. Turpentine after notes. It really did LIVE UP TO ITS name."
""
"O - This can replace BrownShugga' any day (IMO). Wonderfully hopped and absolutely opposite of what I expected being it's a """Holiday Ale""". Lagunitas, add this one to your regular rotation, it's a keeper."
""
""
"Overall - This is a solid brew. If you're a hophead, this seasonal offering is well worth your time."
"Overall: I really hope they end up making this one again. The citrus hop taste is fantastic. I will definitely have this again if I have the chance."
""
""
"Lagunitas Sucks Holiday Ale is rather straight forward in its aroma and flavor profile, yet it is quite impressive nevertheless. Unlike most balanced IPAs that rely on loads of caramel malts to smooth out the hoppy bitterness, Sucks seems to do this by keeping the malts to a minimum and using a hop profile that is both fruity and bright."
"Starts with a resiny mouthfeel that goes along with the strong citric zest and pine needle essence. Super astringent and add some carbonation and you have a bitter, zest hop bomb for the Holidays. Very bitterness/hopcentric. I love IPA's and DIPA's, but this almost makes my lips picker with astringent bitterness. I've drank this romm temp. and cold with the same result. I just can't give it high marks for my palate or in respect to the style designation."
""
"Looking forward to the """leftovers""" release at the start of the new year!"
""
"Nicely done Double IPA!"
""
""
"Wow! is the first thing that comes to mind. My buddy Ed told me how good this beer was. I didn't consider trying it because the label says Brown Shugga subsitute, understandablyI ssumed it was a similar type beer. No way, this double IPA is awespme. The ultra piney aroma hit me in the face as I opened the bottle. The beer is a deep gold and the thin white head laced in thick ring like patterns. The taste buds are assaulted by ultra fresh piney hops that still go down smooth. The beer is just a great experience. I loved it, Ed loves it, my girlfriend loves it. Get it."
"12 oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep amber, good head and lacing. Very bold piney, citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit, tangerine, and other citrus flavors dominate with floral and pine, but malt backdrop a bit on the sweet side. Finishes dry, with hops hanging on to the tongue. Nice west coast style overhopped IPA much more complex and fruitier than Hop Stoopid."
""
"After reading some of the good words about this beer over the last month or so, I am going to have to agree wholeheartedly with the praise that this brew is getting. Truly one of the most solid and unique dipas I have ever had."
"I had been wanting to try this one and am glad I got to. I would have bought several 6 packs of this if it were available here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer! Lagunitas needs to make this a regular in their line-up! Perhaps they can call it “Lagunitas Sucks Year-Round!”"
""
"Overall this is a high-quality IPA, especially for the price. Though everyone seems to worship the tropical fruit qualities of some IPAs, in reality this flavor reminds me immensely of (high quality) fruit juice, and I could only have maybe two of these beers in a row. Great example of that hop profile, though."
"Mouthfeel is thick, hearty, sweet, and bitter yet balanced."
"Overall - By far my favorite offering from lagunitas. I would never turn this one down!"
"Overall one hoppy mother that more than makes up for the lack of Brown Shugga'... D-lish!"
""
"Pours a golden orange with a foamy 1 finger head that disappears to a thin sticky lace around the top of the beer. On the nose, your senses get attacked! Big piny hops, over-ripen citrus fruits, mango, tangerine, grapefruit. Sticky tobacco and marijuana scents in midst of the fruit. Again on the taste, sticky grapefruit, citrus hops, sticky and murky with a feverishly bitter aftertaste that just absolutely hits the spot, wow! Light to medium on the feel and body, bitter, deliciously drinkable, not much malt backbone as noted by other reviewers. This beer is fucking awesome! Make more of this shit and send it my way, im more than fine with having this over BS anyday, superior IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Kinda tastes like a Christmas tree smells, and just in time for the holidays. Oh come all ye faithful!"
"M - Medium body; moderate carbonation."
"A good but not great DIPA. Did not appreciate the dankness as a compliment to the grapefruit."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is fine. But that onion/garlic is a deal breaker. Reminds me of Abrasive. Another extremely highly rated beer that was just a pure garlic/onion bomb. Really not enjoying this quirk in my palate that makes those Summit flavors show up so strongly."
""
""
""
"This beer pushes the style in a way that we are not accustomed to. Typically a brewer with push a style forward, but this one takes a step back, but not in a negative way. The lack of big malt in this beer pulls it back from a DIPA in a very good way. It is a great and unique representation of the style, with a straight up juicy hop forward, bitter ale. I urge Lagunitas to make this a year round offering."
""
""
""
"This beer is amazing. Super bitter hop punch at the front of the mouth and super juicy hop bite in the middle of the mouth. There is a sweet malty backbone that really makes this beer spectacular. The sweet malty goodness of a middle of the country IPA and the epic hopping of a west coast IPA. Epic! Kinda glad there is no Brown Sugga' this year. Kinda ... Cheers!"
""
""
"O: Delicious! Very unique. Probably couldn't have more than one but very enjoyable. The fruit juice character is pretty interesting, that's for sure. Overall a great beer. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one was tasty with a capital T. One of my favorite DIPAs for sure."
"Overall: The aroma was out of this world. It's very much like an IPA. The mouthfeel killed the taste for me though. Just didn't seemed very well balanced. Cheers!"
"O- I really enjoyed this one. Lots of big flavors and real drawbacks."
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer. I'm pretty glad lagunitas screwed up their production and had to make this instead of their usual brown shugga'. A nice departure from their other hoppy flagships. I'm certainly a fan."
""
""
"Picked up a 6er to try and was pretty impressed. I like Lagunitas in that they use a lot of hops and their prices are low. This one fits the bill, it's not mind-blowing but it's a nice DIPA on the lighter side of the style and has some pretty good balance."
""
""
"If you like hoppy beers go buy a six pack of Lagunitas Sucks. However, it could use a touch more sweetness to balance out the bitterness."
""
"The ~8% ABV is a non-factor. Normally I don't really like Lagunitas beers, whether they are hoppy beer or other varieties. Lagunitas sucks, however, is a great IPA that reminds me a little bit of Heady Topper. Definitely a beer worth trying if you get the chance; I hope Brown Shugga never comes back."
""
"Had this on tap in Northampton at the Sierra Grill, and picked up a sixer at my local packy. I heard good things from C-Note and Nichol so I was pumped to try this. Pours a golden yellow color with a nice white head and decent lacing. Nose is nice and hoppy. Tastes like crisp fruit with lots of floral and citrus hops. This is how I like my ipas. NO MALT ALLOWED and the booze only sneaks through a tad. No sweetness at all here. A nice crisp fruit hop head dream here. Very well done. Hope they brew this again."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden-yellow color with a nice white head and quite a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a heavy amount of what seem to be Amarillo hops. Good citrus and a bit of a floral character. Similar flavor, but not quite as pungent and overpowering. No malt to speak of, though a bit of booze works through, doing a great job to balance out the hops. No use of sweetness for that here. Boom."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at mellow mushroom Tampa. Pale gold in appearance one finger head disapates to a ring of foam, great lacing. Aroma of intense citrus hops. Taste follows the nose, grapefruit, pineapple bitter with decent malt backbone. Really tasty, a great surprise from a brewery that hasn't impressed me in the past."
""
"Juicy light bodied glass of beer with a wonderful crisp finish and very pleasant aftertaste. I think I have found a new favorite. I will deeply mourn the passing of this holiday ale."
"Overall: although this brew starts of fairly modestly with a typical coloration and very sweet smell, by the time you start drinking you know you have something good. If I had to characterize this I would call it a Sweet IPA, but not syrupy sweet the way a Dogfish Head 90min can be. Strong enough where I probably would not drink more than one in a sitting. A very good beer that I hope will not go away."
"Expected from Lagunitas; heavy hand of hops and semi-aggressive alcohol ... but does it have a big enough malt backbone to stand up to this? Barely which is true to the DIPA style in a way. It works because the hop flavor is pushed to the front just above the 63.21 IBUs. I would think any higher and this beer would start to lose it. Sad to not see Brown Shugga' but this makes for a good replacement."
""
"D: dangerously quaffable. really doesnt drink like a beer that is almost 8%abv. the hops are very american, very fresh, and very drinkable. a tasty brew i hope they do more than just occasionally!"
""
""
"O - Wow, this was better than I was expecting. Lagunitas hit this one out of the park. It's right up there with SN Celebration as not only the cream of the crop for winter beers, but for widely distributed IPAs. It's an embarrassment of riches right now. I want some more please!"
""
""
""
""
"If you want a citrusy, juicy Double IPA that is relatively easy to find, look no further. After reading that Lagunitas is going to release this again as the """leftovers""" I will certainly be picking up a few of these. This will satisfy anyone's need for a West Coast citrus and hop bomb of an IPA - that's balanced to boot!"
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty much a perfect IPA. I love the tropical fruit and piney hops that mingle with the sweet malts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just to much. Though not surprising from this brewery. Is it impossible to make an IPA without the late addition bittering hops? No balance, and nothing I would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't understand the hype with this beer. It's not something I would seek out and I love IPAs/DIPAs."
""
""
""
"P.S. could give SN Celebration a run for the money."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely one of the better single IPAs out there, with probably the best aroma. While the flavor doesn't quite live up to the aroma, it is still good. It's also a great bargain at $10/sixer."
"A very very good beer. Nice sipper strangely almost chewy great lagunitas flavor. All of their hoppy beers just seem to hit this certain distinctive note that is def lagunitas but with their own subtle nuances, and I like it... a lot.. Can't wait for these bad guys to get rollin out back here in CO again."
"O- what a brew! Lagunitas has always been a great brewery but this is the icing on the cake. This is a spot on west coast hop fest. This brew is just amazing. A true hopfest"
"O - A very enjoyable IPA, though some more bitterness would be welcome. Mouthfeel is very nice."
""
""
"HV"
"O- Overall this was good, a little of a let down though because of the awesome nose. I remember brown shugga being hoppier. I wouldn't say that this sucks by any means, sweet name though and awesome that they took a jab at themselves. I'll enjoy the rest of the growler."
""
"This is a very tasty west coast IPA that does an amiable job of filling in for Brown Shugga.’ It goes down quite easily for a hop head like me and I just may have to pick up some more of this for enjoying through the holiday season."
""
""
"Herbal, woody hop bitterness up front, along with some fruity malt. Huge tropical and citrus fruit hop flavors burst forth, with notable appearances by pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, and sweet clementine oranges. Sugar cookie malt base is clean and sweet enough to complement the fruity bitterness. Finish is drier with lingering hop bitterness. Delicious! Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
"It has a great mouthfeel and is very drinkable. I had to buy this from Oaktree online; I WISH this was distributed to Casper like some of the other brews from Lagunitas."
"I'm sure a lot of hopheads will be sad if this doesn't return in 2012."
"Overall: The malts provide a neutral backdrop for the hops to work their magic and that is a great thing for a Double IPA to accomplish"
"Definitely recommended!"
""
""
""
"This is by far the best ale I have ever had from Lagunitas, period. It is supposed to be a seasonal, so make sure you get at least one six-pack. This is definitely an ale that is NOT to be missed. Highly, highly recommended."
"I've been enjoying this beer for weeks and am into my 3rd sixer. Finally found the time to review it. Hops may be starting to fade from my initial tastings, but it's still a freaking great brew."

""""Please make this a year-round beer because I think you nailed the DIPA recipe at an outstanding price point.""""

"O: This is a really solid brew. I'm a fan. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up another 6-pack before it sells out."
""
"O: I really like this one. Like many Lagunitas beers, this is pretty solid. I go A for sure. They most certainly don't SUCK!"
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly tacky. A very drinkable Double IPA. I need to find a bottle of this."
"Beer is medium in body, sweet on the lead off and here comes the hops. Fruit salad beer, it is like hop candy, the sweetness of the backbone plays well with the hops, still a little heavier than expected but the hop flavors are all there. A very good little beer, glad I grabbed it."
""
"Overall a good hit for Lagunitas, I'll have another any time."
""
""
""
""
"overall it's a solid IPA thats nice on the pallet. and very worth the $9.99 for a 6 pack"

"T: Pretty solid pine hop flavor with a slight biscuity malt undertone. Mango, apricot and some peach towards the finish. Overall, the best beer I've had from them."
""

"O: I can see why this has the hype it does. This beer is phenomenal. It's so drinkable and crisp I can't put it down. The hops and fruits are perfect."
"Overall this is a great beer. Trully a unique beer (to me)."
"O: I've never had Brown Shugga' but substituting this can't be much of a step back. This is a very flavorful DIPA. Can't complain about it at all."
"Poured a clear golden color with a few stray bubbles wandering on top. Sticky hop aroma, citrus, pine, some oily funk. More of the same in the taste, with a combination of hops being the dominant factor, and a bready, caramel malt base in the background, and the lingering bland cardboard flavor that seems to be present in every Lagunitas beer. A citrus twinge lingers on the palate, and gives way to a sweeter taste of melon and mango, making you almost forget about the unctuous funk quality. Light-medium in the mouthfeel department, and fairly drinkable, but not something I'd revisit. Typical Lagunitas: okay, but nothing special, and always that stale and seemingly inescapable house flavor that continues to make me wonder why people like their beers, and why there's a hype over this one in particular."
""
"O - Again, great holiday brew. This one trumps celebration in my opinion. Fantastic."
"Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Pretty dry but still good and worth a taste!"
""
""
""

"Overall- Very easy to drink, hides the abv very, very well. It smells superb and tastes just as amazing. Seriously, this beer smells incredible. I would definitely purchase again."
"O-just wow. loved this so much more than Brown Shugga. i loved this more than most beers. so much flavor and its so smooth! i NEED more! if you enjoy hops, search this out!"
"O - A solid DIPA, but not mind-blowing like it has been for many other BA's. That said, it's easy to find, enjoyable to drink, and priced very reasonably. Hard to find that combo all in one beer, no doubt about it...bonus points for that. Recommend."
""
"O: A very drinkable IPA that I will be seeking out this time next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"flavor, smell, overall... I'm a big fan"
"1/3/2014: Enjoyed several of this years batch and again it was nearly perfect. Juicy citrus hops with pineapple, orange, lemon and then a combo of piney hops and a sweet malty backbone that was almost chewy. Sweet, hoppy and balanced, this tasted like fresh hops were added and the grains and caramel/brown sugar flavors made it flow down easy. It's a shame this only comes out for a limited time as I could and would drink this year round."
""
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. On the small side for a DIPA, but very well done. Like a super Little Sumpin Sumpin."
"I hope Lagunitas makes this a new seasonal but keep it somewhat limited. Good IIPA that I would like to try extremely fresh."
""
""
"Finally found this after much waiting. Miss the Brown Shugga but I move forward. Pours a very clear apricot color with a nice cream colored foamy head and nice lacing. The aroma is great! Mango, grapefruit, lemon zest and orange rind. The taste is very hoppy, lemony and piney with a big bitterness on the back end. Slightly spicy on the swallow with a touch of more bitters on the aftertaste. Salivation a plenty. Mucho carbonation. Overall I enjoyed the session but it was a little too much for my buds. Too much of a good thing? Maybe. Even with a modest 7.85%, multiples would be tiresome on this palate. A good beer but better one's are out there from the Petaluma crew."
"Pours a bit thin, not much foam, lacing, but the head dies quick, no big deal really. The SMELL, nice, fruity grapefruit, pineapple, ranks near the top on nose alone. The taste almost follows, but a bit thin compared to what I smell. Decent finish but falls off a little ,no real boom on the backside. Really a well done brew, I hope it goes regular. I've heard comparisons to Pliny, well, no, but don't let that stop you from trying. I also like they didn't go the ultra sweet route and malt this one to death looking for depth."
"You know, I like this so much that I really don't mind having the Brown Shugga this year."
""
""
"Medium body, nice carbonation. Alcohol is hidden pretty well. Great hop combinations here. Very well done."

"O - Good beer, really enjoyed this one quite a bit with my lunch. Would gladly drink this one again. A good beer by a brewery that I think, well, sucks."
""

""
"- Hops. Hops. More hops. This is just a sweet hoppy monster of a beer. I wonder if they just took Hop Stoopid, and dry-hopped the living hell out of it some more. In fact, I think that is just what they did. Certainly seems like it was brewed with some candy sugars or something much the same. A solid hop monster, and more a novelty beer for me. Hard to drink more than 1."
""
"Lagunitas really scored a home run on this one. I’m not sure if they’re going to be making this part of their yearly line up, but I really hope that they do. Otherwise, I guess we can hope that they start to make this their new holiday release, and we’ll all have something to look forward to every year."

"O: This beer gives me a rock-solid."
" Over the top excellent, Plus one in every category."
""
"Overall this is a good DIPA, but nothing I'd consider spectacular. I almost feel like I'd rather have some Hop Stoopid, but can't be sure since I haven't had the two side by side. Regardless, another quality offering from a brewery that really """sucks.""""
"Got this 12 oz. bottle on a tip from the guys at Pinocchios. Poured (into a New Belgium tulip glass) an only slightly-cloudy, golden amber with a smallish one-finger head which dissipated quickly. While there was lacing, it was thin. The nose of this beer was amazing - grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple and pine. The taste is just about as good. It hits hard at first with the hop and citrus you would expect, follows with some biscuity malt and ends with a pleasant dry bitterness. Wow. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. This was a great beer! PLEASE convince Lagunitas to keep going with this! And if you are an IPA lover and haven't tried it - do it!"
""
"O - Very good DIPA, very juicy, but perfectly balanced. Hope they continue making this and it does not end up as just a one-off. Definitely lives up to the hype"
""
"Overall: I am a fan of piney hops, so to me this is a nice slow drinker. The hops tend to be in your face as I find with most brews from Lagunitas. I enjoyed this one as a sipper and would certainly pick this up again if I had a hops fix. That said, I do not think that this is the world beater IPA that I have seen discussed. Good yes, but I have had more complex IPAs that I enjoy more."
""
"O: A great beer not your typical winter seasonal but delicious this deserves to get a year round release! makes up for no brown shugga this year you guys don't suck Lagunitas"
"My only complaint is the ABV. Lagunitas is a little too much of a bang for the buck at times."
""
"O- I love Lagunitas for making this beer, for the way this beer happened, and for the name they gave it. A reflection of great attitudes and great brewing abilities."
"This is undoubtedly one of the best things I've had from Lagunitas. I'm not sure why they're never put something like this out before as it is better than any other IPA they've produced. Excellent beer."
""
"Overall, it's okay, but I'm unimpressed. I don't know what to think, and whether it's an actual good sample of the beer? That remains to be seen."
""
""
"Update on 12/16/13 (updated score). Drinking one today that was bottled on December 6th. Really good, nice tropical, fruity hop profile. Very smooth."
""
""
"Opinion: This is a good beer, no doubt. The balance is boldly hoppy enough and yet balanced enough to make me think that this is an altered version of their very successful Hop Stoopid. I like that Lagunitas seems to have a grasp of how to make a balanced beer, and it seems that only Great Divide is one of the other breweries that showcase hops, yet can still make a palatable beer. I am not saying the typical """hop bombs""" suck, but it is good to get one that has some balance in the finish. This is a good beer overall, and I would recommend it whether you like DIPA's or not as this is a well blended brew."
"T: Slightly sweet tropical fruit mango/pineapple up front with bright floral oiliness. Middle is nicely balanced with a punch of floral/pine bitterness balanced by more mango/lemon/orange/pineapple citrus honey sweetness and tons of floral character…. I can imagine myself licking a tigerlilly, partially because the hops are so thick and pervasive. Clean and smooth though, surprisingly easy drinking. Definitely doesn't come across as a 'heavy' DIPA. Finish is loaded with that deep, dark floral note from the nose riding over a light wave of mango bitterness and golden raisin which doesn't linger long but has a hint of pepper."
""
"The taste is more well balanced than most DIPAs, with mellow toasted and biscuit flavors to match the obvious hops. Lemon rind, a heavier dose of pine, some floral notes; nothing fancy but very well done for what it is. Extremely easy to drink despite sitting on the aftertaste for a while. Too bad this is a one off because this is a good beer, even for Lagunitas."
"o - overall, WOW! this beer can hang with the best of them. if it was year-round, i could see this being THE beer that is always in my fridge. just a great example of a great classic IPA. very impressive indeed."
"O-I think the review speaks for itself. Know I'm upset I only bought a single and not a 6 pack."
"O-glad I only had a 9oz. pour. I don't think I would order this again."
"This is one of the many great surprises that I have come across this year. Arguably, one of my favorite of the Lagunitas lineup."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops. In the taste, a dry orange rind citrus, pineapple, mango and a touch of apricot. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange citrus rind in the aftertaste. What a nice mistake, big hops and I loved it!"
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"regardless, this is an amazing beer. and at the price, cannot be topped."
"O-Best holiday ale i have had yet. Very good IPA. One of the best well balanced I have had."
"O= One hell of a beer. I will be buying a lot more of this. I don't know why it took me so long to buy one sixer. I love lagunitas for all they do... Maybe not their RIS but everything else is top notch. This beer propells them deeper into my favorites category. Loving this beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium and pleasant. Overall, very nice."
"This is a really good beer. IMO, not quite on the level of Abrasive or Heady Topper, but pretty darn close. Wow. Lagunitas should make more mistakes, so they grace us with more epic apologies like this one. I will definitely be having a few more of these before they disappear."
"O- Very well done. Honestly could care less about Brown Shugga after trying this. Reminds me almost of a cross between the IPA, Hop Stoopid, and Waldo. Bring this one year round fellas!"
"Medium gold clear body a multitude of small bubbles continually rising to soapy white two finger head, medium slow dissipation with above average lacing retained. Big fruity hop aroma, grapefruit and apricot, clean malt backbone. Taste is more apricot than citrus ala Sculpin (!), a bit of piney resin on backend, clean malt bill. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, good effervescence. Not sure about the hubbub about hop fade, this still tasting pretty good."
"O- Pretty solid beer here for sure."
"A very good DIPA, as most DIPAs are from Lagunitas. That being said, this is not quite in the same league as the Plinys of the world."
"Notes: A solid beer all the way around and rather drinkable. Cheers."
"I think this is an amazing replacement for Brown Shugga (fingers crossed that it's permanent). The hops are forthright without being unpalatable and the fruit notes make it drinkable and provide striking balance. A triumph!"
""
"This is listed as a Brown Sugga replacement. Good idea, I hope they keep making it because it's now one of my favorite DIPAs."
"Overall, while the hoppy notes are great, I found the beer to have just a tad too much candy-like sweetness, and wanted a few more grain flavors to help balance things out. Even then, this is still good fare, despite the self-deprecating label."
""

"Overall: A Very good IPA. Nice tropical taste and well balanced. One of the best new brews to come out this year."

"Great beer, all hop flavor without a cloying sweet malt body. Very enjoyable."
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, sticky and juicy on the tongue. This is BY FAR the best beer I've ever had from Lagunitas - I want more!"
""
"Overall. Blown away by this one. I have to say, I wasn't a huge fan of Brown Sugga but this, this is pretty sick. I don't think I've even tasted a persimmon in the last 10 years but it seems distinct in this brew. I need some more of this stuff. I was happy to see a single here in taxedupthepooper-Canada because $20 for 6 is just stupid. ...considering being stupid now."
""
""
"Overall (4.5): This would be a near perfect beer if not so damn sweet; a common complaint of mine with Lagunitas. The hop profile is phenomenal; it should probably be more balanced considering the residual sweetness, but the hops dominate any malt bill. Will be drinking this one all winter hopefully; lives up to the hype, particularly for those that don't mind the signature Lagunitas sweetness."
""
""
"This is a fantastic beer. I went in thinking this was just going to be another good IPA and realized it was great. The tropical fruit flavor is awesome...like a Sculpin Lifesaver. Excellent."
"Overall I repeat Damn this is Tasty! Think I will head out and buy all the six packs of this I can find."
""
"Addendum) 1/9/13 I've had this brew on tap and out of the bottle this year, and I realized I shortchanged it in appearance and aroma. I adjusted my rating accordingly. This is a fantastic beer, and I love drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
"If I could wish for one thing in this brew is a little more of a malt background. Have some Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Wild in the fridge will make sure to compare the two before they are gone. Once again Wow!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The buzz about this beer is correct, huge aroma and flavor profile, I hope they continue to brew this baby."
""
""
"Overall a simple but impressive beer. Very tasty and one of the better values in hopy craft beer right now. Having one of these and then having any of Wildmer's beers with some of the new hop strains in them makes me realize that Lagunitas is really good at making hoppy beers."
""
"O - Overall a really solid DIPA, among the best you can find in major distribution. Hoppy, but with a well balanced though subtle malt characteristic that doesn't detract from the hops at all."
""
""
"Alright, yes lagunitas you suck i love brown sugga' so much but oh well i felt if this is what you were replacing it with it must be good. Poured into a nonic and yields a pale golden color with a white soapy head on top and has coarse spotty retention. the aroma. the aroma is a big citrus punch with some pine, floral and dank hops. CITRAAAA a light sugary sweetness came initially but im not getting it as much anymore. the taste follows the nose definitely, the citrus is there and there is a good hoppy bitterness in the finish but not enough. im not a fan of this sweetness it has, which is just too much and fights the hops and is not complimenting at all. there is some light breadiness as well. the mouthfeel is just like the majority of their IPA's, medium carbonation and crisp. overall i want my brown shugga' back!"
"After trying quite a few beers from Lagunitas over the past few years, I know one thing for certain – Lagunitas does not suck! Not even close! Personally, I prefer this release over Brown Shugga’. Frankly, it’s not even close. Lagunitas Sucks is an excellent American IPA that’s just about ideal in my book. The flavor simply rocks! If you see some around, do yourself a favor and grab a 6-pack or two. You’ll be glad you did. Lagunitas, please bring this one back!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful light amber. A little white head(No worries about heading over your glass). Lots of caronation. Good hop nose. Taste is alright. A little piney, but overly not to strong. Leaves a bit of hoppyness in your mouth. Overall, it's not Brown Shugga"
""
""
"Like It? Yeah"
""
"O: A good DIPA packed full of hops and juicy fruits. However, the sweetness is a bit too aggressive for my personal preference and it throws the beer off a bit. However, still a tasty and enjoyable brew."
"O: Overwhelming hops taken to a sophisticated level. Try and get your hands on some!"
"This is an excellent DIPA and unexpected as a winter seasonal. This can hold its own with just about any of its limited release brethren."
"O - fantastic brew."
""
"D: A very nice, dankly hoppy offering from Lagunitas, a brewery very adept at such beers. The hop profile is quite vibrant without becoming cumbersome, and it drinks quite nicely considering its overall heft. A worthy beer and an appreciated gift from my Secret Santa this year."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a nice one finger head. The smell is nice piney hops with a good malt presence. The flavor is also hoppy up front with the malt backbone that keeps it from getting to out of hand. Mouthfeelmis medium and wellmcarbed. Overall this is amgood ipa"
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer."
"o - Overall I thought this was an awesome DIPA. Ton of citrus hops and tropical fruits, and not a lot of bitterness makes it pretty easy to drink. Would love to have this again and definitely a nice substitute for Brown Shugga."
"Overall: Another winner from Lagunitas. Does it taste like many of their other beers? Sure. Do I care? No. Is it better than Brown Shugga? Yes. Bring this back somehow."
"O: I enjoyed it and will buy it again if it is released in the future, but I'd prefer a SN Celebration."

"D: Very easy to drink this, my glass was in need of a refill before I knew it."

"The intense level of the flavor profile is somewhat surprising, given the <8% ABV. Whether this one is a PtE clone or not, it's straight delicious, and I will be searching feverously for a case starting tomorrow morning."
"Also, like Daisy Cutter, it's pretty thin. Easy to drink and tasty enough."
""
"Great mouth feel to the ale, though it seems slightly under carbonated. ABV of 7.85% is completely hidden, mostly by the 100% PSTU (Pine Smell & Taste Unit). I love this beer. I love this brewery. I’ll drink this again soon,"
"I tried this on the recommendation of my friend jastack. I'm very glad I did. I can't speak much for the color since I have only been drinking it out of the bottle. But the smell is amazing. Truly smells like Christmas. Almost reminds me of a Christmas Tree. Once I drank it I knew it would be a favorite. Has a perfect hoppy taste that's not too overbearing but just right. It reminds me of a 90 minute, but smoother. It goes down very smooth. I brought it to my brother-in-law's house last weekend. He drinks one of two things, whiskey or cheap beer. The only time he tries anything good is if I'm around. He couldn't get enough of the stuff. It's amazing, and I only hope that they keep it around for years to come."
"Tough to set this one down. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A poor mans Hopslam dare I say. A solid DIPA that I will have no problem enjoying the rest of my bottles."
""
""
""
"(O) Solid DIPA. I actually like this better than their original IPA and Maximus. I like fresh hopped beers and this seems like it was done with fresh hops. Can it give Pliny a run for it's money as some people have suggested? I don't think so because it's a different beer and done differently. It's good on its own, let's not toss it up against Pliny."
"Another good bang for the buck beer from Lagunitas, but not a major departure from their more standard hoppy offerings."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a fantastic hoppy beer. I really loved the juicy, fruity, hoppy flavors. Very easy drinking, flavorful and at a very reasonable price as well. Lagunitas nailed it on this one. I'd buy this all the time if they decide to make it more often."
""
"I have to say, this beer surprised me. I have not had the Brown Shugga and do not know how good it is, but after trying it's stand in, I certainly hope they do not permanently shelve this beer after this run. It is much to good for that."
""
""
"Nice beer. It reminds me of little something wild with a little more of that tangy simco hop flavor to it. I will defiantly do this one again."
""

"O - An excellent DIPA from Lagunitas. I love the tropical and citrus aroma. West coast brew for sure. I didn't really know what to expect with this. But I can say this is a winner. I actually enjoy this beer more than I do Brown Shugga. I hope this doesn't stay a limited brew."
"This was a pleasant surprise. Huge hop flavor and dangerously drinkable. I'm a huge fan and will certainly be picking this beer up again. I hope they start making this year round!"
"Drink- It's very good. It wasnt mind-blowing but I really enjoyed the layers from the tropical to the malt profile to the low bitter level. I will be for sure drinking the rest of these alone with the shades drawn. My neighbors can't know I have this."
"O- Amazing beer! I'm not one to compare beers usually, but the first smell and taste of this beer I immediately thought....Hopslam! Lagunitas better make this at least a yearly release or their a retard."
""
"Right up there with Hop Stoopid in my book. If this never comes back I would be very disappointed."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a two finger head that sticks around. Aroma is perfect. Very reminiscent of LSS. I get tons of mango and papaya on the nose with some citrus as well. The taste is very similar to the nose. Tropical fruits all the way. Slight bitterness. Nice dry finish. Overall, the aroma far and away makes this beer for me. It's tasty, but the smell outweighs the taste. I prefer LSS, but this is not far behind. Great brew."
"O. A very good IPA and one I could drink at any time of the year, not just at Christmas. I hope they decide to make this 'limited release' again."
"Overall - Really was impressed by this, at 11 bucks a 6 pack here in MA you can't go wrong, it smells and tastes absolutely amazing which i value more than appearance and mouthfeel. THANK YOU LAGUNITAS!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and the balance is so good that there is no hint of the hidden alcoholic power of the beer."
"A god beer but definitely not what everyone is making it out to be. This is far from a Pliny and no where near a Heady Topper in my opinion. At the same time, I'd rather have this than a Brown Sugga."
""
""
"Light golden/orange body with a thin head that leaves a decent skim of head. YUM; nose is grapefruit and lemon zest, grapefruit juice with sugar, sour orange and some cat piss. Taste is same as the nose, but with a little caramelized toast. Despite the big nose and flavor bitterness is moderate and finishes surprisingly clean. While high in alcohol there is no burn. Mouth is a little chewy, but crisp. I like Brown Sugah, but I LOVE this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops, slight floral, hint of grass, hint of wet hops, and hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight floral, slight wet hops, hint of alcohol, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of grass. Overall, good appearance, blend, and body. Very reminiscent of other Lagunitas brews in flavor and aroma. The 'Holiday' in the name commonly evokes a certain spiciness. The spice is sadly lacking in this brew."
"fairly clear, light amber with a white head that leaves some lace. nose is (kind of standard, but never gets old) grapefruit, orange and lemon rind with a piney character balancing them out, on top of sweet and pale malty notes that also are a hint spicy. taste follows suit. lots of hoppy character to it. drinks a tad hot, but a nice, warming, pleasant kind of hot it is. medium-full body. pleasant, prickly bitterness. apparently lagunitas doesn't suck. mostly everyone so far (including me) likes this one. a lot of reviews in a very short time, and i know it isn't even released in some markets yet. i can sum this one up by stating that it is remarkable how much it reminded me of Sierra Nevada's celebration ale... but on steroids. kind of like an imperial celebration. very good. hoppy holidaze."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! Served at a good temperature, with a nice, off white, foamy, frothy head that soon settled to a thin cover and plenty of lace. Color is a very clear yellow amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is hops on top, then pineapple, resin, tiny bit of citrus, leather, earth. Flavor is similar to nose, quite dry, good carbonic tang, a bit earthy. Body is great, ditto carbonation and a little chewy. Finish is like flavor, some alcohol warmth, and has good length"
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi translucent light amber color with a thin ring of head. Some lacing. Smells wonderful. Tropical fruits. Pineapple,mango, orange and some others. Taste is hoppy with the tropical fruits again. Definitely can tell this is a Lagunitas beer. Bitter orange near the end. Somewhat oily. Certainly one of the lightest Dipas I've had but I can't really hold that against it. Easy to drink, hoppy and tasty. Overall, I need more of this."
"Heard the hype and can't believe my local hole had a keg!!! Truly looks like any Joe Pilsner. Smell is awesome...piney yet sweet. Definitely an IPA....but different. Much sweeter....maybe oranges instead of lemon zest. Not dry. Very good!!! Lived up to the hype. Bring on the Pliny (never had it)"
"Overall - I find myself contemplative in every sip, a great complexity and a great balance of wonderful flavors going on here. Alcohol is completely hidden. I will definitely be purchasing more of this while it is still available. Great job again Lagunitas, two thumbs up from me, highly recommend."
"Medium bodied with a prominent dry and bitter hop presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt backbone into a dry, boozy finish. There's some sticky pine needle flavor which is countered by sweet citrus and tropical fruit, notably grapefruit, pineapple and lemon rind. The malt backbone provides decent balance without interfering with the hops, giving off biscuit and graham cracker notes before finishing with more boozy sweetness. A bit hot for my liking but still pretty drinkable."
""
"This Ale is the perfect gift for a hophead. I give a thumbs up~~~"
""
""
"Excellent hop combination going on here and a great example of an American DIPA. Lagunitas are hops magicians."
"O: Very well blended and balanced; fairly straightforward. Hops are assertive, though not overpowering due to presence of malt baseline. A good value. For me, it ranks just above A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale as a favorite from Lagunitas."
"Overall, I love it. Right up my alley with a well hopped IPA. I can see it fading pretty fast though. I hope this isn't a one and done."
"Notes: Nothing wrong with Brown Shugga, that is/was a nice brew. But this is surely much more up my alley. The overblown joke of an apology making it rather memorable around this new offering works pretty well… Very nice holiday offering."
"Flavor delivers more lush hop flavors, very citrusy again, moderate resiny bitterness, grapefruit and orange peel derived, some light pale malt notes in the middle. Dry and pleasant aftertaste of lingering hops. Medium bodied, and very sessionable despite the higher ABV. Pretty delicious IPA. Amped up citrusy hops with a great drinkability to it."

"Good DPA. Not epic."
""
"As we ride home (I called us a cab) with your x-mas tree-infused sweetness still on my mind and lips, I realize this: I love you and you might be pregnant."
"Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a crystal clear orange/yellow color- decent head and nice retention. Visible small bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Smell- WOW. Just a blast of citrus, tropical hop aroma, mango, pineapple, lemon zest. Taste- just a tropical fruit sweetness- definitely mango, papaya up front, a wave of nice hop bitterness on the side of the tongue, a perfectly balanced sweetness to counter the hop bitterness. This is an absolutely incredible IPA- perfectly balanced, full of all of my favorite tropical hops flavors. Perfect mouthfeel, medium bodied, appropriate carbonation. This is one of the best IPA's I have had recently, and I would pit this up against any of the top West Coast IPAs. Bravo guys- you can make this instead of Brown Shugga any day in my book."
""
"Poured on tap at Capone's into a pint glass. Pours a hazy yet largely transparent golden hue with a scant head. Leaves very nice and sticky lacing behind. The nose is citrus heavy with light hoppiness. Lots of grapefruit with no pine The taste is beyond refreshing. Perfect combo of hops and citrus. The mouthfeel is great too. It doesn't scorch your tongue or hang out for long. In, out, hello, goodbye, thank you very much. Great IPA. Lagunitas certainly does NOT suck. Neither does this beer."

"I like it quite a bit. Thanks for f***ing up the Brown Suggah this year Lagunitas. I had a good time with it's replacement!"

"Overall a nice seasonal IPA, comparable to Celebration Ale I'd say. Good price."
"Pretty good stuff...nice aroma, kinda comes across as a rye and/or danker version of their Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’. Definitely a far cry from Brown Shugga, but a worthwhile replacement brew for this winter."
""
"D/O- I enjoyed this one a lot. In a crowded field of DIPAs, this one holds it own by being a tad different than the majority of it's peers. Drinkability is not high, most likely a """one and done""" beer...the price point is great at around $10 for a six pack. Definitely recommended to dank DIPA fans. Thanks for the brew lou91!"
""
"i cant even believe im admitting this, but I actually dont mind the marijuana flavors. Well done Lagunitas (you still suck)"
"Very drinkable but not balanced enough to make it exceptional in my book. Add a little more residual sweetness and this would be a great beer."
""
""
""
"This is, by far, the best sixer your $10 can buy this holiday season."
"Dr: It seems they just dumped hops in without considering balance. I had high hopes for this, but it epitomizes the worst aspects of beers that handle the style in precisely the wrong way."
""
"Lagunitas Sucks is a great beer name. The liquid is a pretty bright golden color with a small amount of whitw bubbles, barely a skim, moderate lacing though, squiggly lines. Smell is on the sweet side but hoppy as well, sweet bubblegum scent, weed, juicy citrus and a malt punch, great scent. Taste is enjoyable, alot of different things balancing sweet and hoppy in that order with the above mentioned scents going into the taste without the weed. Feel is on the light side for a double, carb is light in most of the bottles I had. This is good beer but the sweet outguns the hoppy in the end. I could do a bottle of this in a sitting but nothing more, just too much. Lagunitas continues to up their anne. They don't go the hype, massive inperial 18% stout route, they just do them, who can fault that."
"Wow, really impressed with this. Grabbed a sixer of this for $9.99 after hearing all the buzz on BA, and I couldn't be happier that I did. I've never had Brown Shugga, but it'll have to be pretty goddamn good to not make me miss this stuff when next year rolls around."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, clear, vibrant, honey-yellow coloring with only a slight filming on top. The nose is an interesting blend of citrus, hops, cut grass, and cedar. It's like every time you smell, you get a whiff of a different green characteristic. Flavor is heavy on the tart grapefruit, and it does of good job of being sweet enough to balance the tartness, also. Good spicy hops presence as well, and the beer comes off extremely well blended and smooth. The aftertaste is slight, with a roasted quality, and some of the lingering citrus. The beer has an amazingly fast and clean finish, leaving the tongue a slight bit dry. Great brew."

"Pours much lighter in color than I would have expected; lively carbonation and awesome sticky lacing. Smells of tangy citrus and pine; awesome. Taste follows with some sweeter citrus and tropical fruit notes as well. Very easy drinking, especially for a DIPA. This is the best I've had yet of the style. Very very good."
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pour a clear light golden color with a decent sized off white head, this leaves a slight lacing. The smells are full of grapefruit and pine king with some sweet malts. The feel is medium, the taste is pretty good lots of bitter grapefruit with some caramel sweetness, good stuff."
""
""
""
"O: Both Huhzubendah and Jayhawk (a couple of reviews down) about this one. I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict that this one will be in the top 100 here on BA by the time all is said and done..."
"Overall I don't usually pick IPA's to drink but this is pretty good even for someone who doesn't like very hoppy beers."
"O: Just like everyone else, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised by this guy. The citrus bursts in your mouth and the malts and slight pine bitterness really balance it out. The drinkability is off the charts."

"This beer shocked me to my core. A world class DIPA that wasn't even on my radar. At $10 per sixer, this is an absolute must try if you enjoy hop forward beers."
""
"O: You could easily call this Lagunitas Winter DIPA (which is what it really is). Being a seasonal christmas beer, I was expecting something really special. Instead, it's just another DIPA. Terrible? No. Disappointing? Yes."
""
""
"O- A very hoppy and crisp brew from Lagunitas. Easy to drink and enjoyable. Glad that they came up with something new to 'replace' brown sugar this season and this beer does make up for it. A great value at ~$10 a 6pk."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a tasty 2ipa"
"O: Not at all what I expected when I picked up this holiday offering from Lagunitas, but that's what I love the most about it. Hops are all throughout this brew. Well balanced for an imperial IPA with a great finish. Between this and Sierra Nevada's Celebration, it's going to be a good holiday."

"Pours a golden yellow color w/ a nice one finger white head. Massive sheets of lacing left on my snifter glass. The beer is very clear, w/ good carbonation. Smell is really nice- hops, wood, floral notes, maybe some pepper. Really hoppy, well balanced, really nice nose. Not overbearing at all. Taste is good as well- hops in abundance, w/ some malt in the background. Some floral, pepper, and spice in there as well. But let's not kid ourselves... the hops are in charge here. After half a bottle, they've had their way with me.... in a good way. None of the 7.85% alcohol is evident at all- very well hidden. Feel is medium, with nice carbonation. Killer hops bite on the aftertaste. The hops coat your throat like a throat lozenge. Overall, this beer really surprised me. I really enjoyed it. Cheers!"
"Overall: Easily my favorite brew Lagunitas has ever released. I'm just hoping they keep this one around for years to come!"
""
"This appears to be a pale golden straw color. It has a big hop aroma, as should be expected of anything from Lagunitas, reminiscent of grapefruit zest and other citrus. Tasting it gives the impression that it’s lightly hopped but full of flavor—a floral, fruity hop bill with just a touch of pine that makes it a delight to drink. I hope that this joins the regular line-up, or at least comes around to visit again next year."
"One vote here for making this beer for every holiday throughout the year."
""
""
"Medium body and carbonation with a nicely creamy mouthfeel. Long and lingering aftertaste in which the bitterness comes to the fore. Maybe I haven't had a really fresh, quality IPA - which is clearly what this is - in a while, but this really hit the spot. In retrospect this is approaching hopbomb territory...it won't seem balanced if you don't like big, hoppy IPA's as a rule, but if you do, there's a nice undertone of sweetness and faint spiciness that offsets the IBU's just a smidge."
""
"Update: I love the fine print on Lagunitas's bottles. They're blunt and crude with their statements but don't come off snobby like Stone's sayings sometimes do. I realize now why it's called """Brown Shuggah Substitute.""" It says: """This sad holiday season we didn't have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew, the widely feared BrownShugga' ale. We're just out of capacity. There is nothing cool about screwing up this badly and we know it.""" I personally think the Sucks Holiday Ale is even better than Brown Shugga'. Go figure."
"O: Really a good beer. Gonna have more of this."
"O: Very drinkable with a nice complex yet smooth taste. I love the tongue in cheek humor here as well. I'm sad I missed out on Brown Shugga, but this is definitely is something I'm glad to drink."
"Great brew for sure..."
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer reminds me of some other Ipa's that have come out recently. Most notably...Southern Tier 2X, and Troegs Perpetual Ipa. My only criticism is that I feel that the alcohol shows itself just a bit too much. Otherwise, it's a great beer."
"O- Very enjoyable limited edition that should probably replace brown shugga"
"Overall this is up there with Hop Stoopid and Little Sumpin' Sumpin' as one of my favorite Lagunitas beers. They do not suck. Outstanding."
""
""
"Overall: Just as the season for Sierra Nevada Celebration is ending, Lagunitas puts out a holiday ale that picks up where it left off. Great hop fix."
"O: If I didn't like the """Lagunitas taste""" so much, this would be barely average. As it sits, it's just """good""". There's just nothing to it really. Nothing exciting or new going on here."
"Overall - Well this was just awesome. One of the best new beers ive had this year. Fantastic hop bitterness, floral sweetness, and killer balance. Already plan on getting more and hop(e) this becomes a annual beer."
"Medium body. Easy drinking yet full of flavor. This should be a year round brew. By far my favorite from Lagunitas, even topping Hop Stoopid. You can definitely sense dryhopping at its finest here."
"Yeah, Lagunitas Sucks. The lighthearted humility to lead with that line betrays the confidence of the brewers. These guys are on target and firing for effect. Clean, powerful, fresh, love these guys.This hop monster is an entertaining sipper on a cold night."
"O- Definately a different beer here. Hoppy and piney with some fruitiness but not your average IPA."
"O - It's been a while since I've had a Lagunitas beer, but this one seems to have a more complex hop profile than others I've tried. It's incredibly tasty and very easy to drink. I really hope they turn this into a regular seasonal. Highly recommended."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quiet nice and very dangerous in regards to drinkability. I could easily have another one or two of these but I suspect I would regret it. I like the hop profile with this one but as the beer warms up the bitterness gets more pronounced...so as much as I want to savor this beer, I think it has a narrow temperature window of perfect flavor, and this is not a beer for slamming back. So overall a good beer, but for hopheads, I suspect this is a great beer. Not as good as the Maximus I had recently, but still quite good."
"Overall: A decent beer, but by no means a substitute for Brown Sugga'. Drinkability is moderate."
""
""
"This beer pours a nice clearish golden amber color. There is a finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a nice sheet of lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice bit of caramel malt and piney hop presence. There are a good amount of tropical fruit aromas, as well as a nice helping of holiday spices. The taste starts off with a good amount of spice flavor. There is a nice bit of caramel malt and a good amount of piney hop flavor. There is also a bit of fruitiness. The finish leaves some lingering sweetness and hop bitterness behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. I goes down easy, and it has a nice smooth feel to it. There is some tingling from the spices and a good amount of hop bitterness. Also, there is some sweetness. A little bit of boozy warmth is noticeable in the finish. this has good drinkability. It is basically holiday IPA which I haven't really experienced before. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, and I think it is quite unique. I also appreciate Lagunitas sense of humor and commitment to their fans. This is a good beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
""
"Overall: This is delicious beer. Stands on as a great new beer from Lagunitas. Though BrownShugga is a very good ale, and one I enjoy, I'd trade it all to have this all the time. Make this a regular offering!"
"O: Lagunitas does suck... because they cant make this year round. This is one of their best beers by far and I wish I could get it all the time."
"According to the label, """There is nothing cool about screwing up this badly and we know it""" but I'd say this is pretty cool. Lagunitas, please keep this as a regular offering."
" Man, Lagunitas just keeps churning out the goods. Yet another great beer from a great brewery. Probably my #1 from these guys."
""
""
"This one hits all the right floral / citrus / grapefruit notes in both aroma and flavor. The hop flavors just blend well together - it's basically a beer that makes you forget about complexity and concentrate on enjoying a good beer with friends."
""
""
"Notes: Clean, refreshing, and very flavorful. Mouthfeel is moderate to medium in body, and finish lasts forever. Drinkability is impeccable. It's a style I would only expect Lagunitas to release at this time of year rather than in the warmer months. While I anticipate the return of Brown Shugga', this brew definitely fills the void."
""
"O - It's no Brown Sugga, and I wasn't expecting such a hop presence, but it is a solid brew."
""
""
"D - If the taste had matched the aroma this would have been a serious contender in a very competitive genre. Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit and will have to have a few more pints/bottles of this one before it disappears for the season. Much better than Brown Shugga, so I hope they keep this as their holiday seasonal."
""
"Taste-Full-on juicy hops and tropical fruit. Brown sugar-coated pineapple and fresh piney, sticky hops assault the senses. Wonderfull. Like a """lighter""" version of Brown Shugga. Delicious! Get some before it's gone! Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another very well done IPA from the guys at Lagunitas. I really hope it makes a return after this holiday season."
"I am not a huge fan of brown shuggah but I know a lot of people who like it so I won't knock it. Lagunita's would make a great decision if they offered this terrific IPA frequently. It's tasty, characteristic and drinkable."
"O: Really solid ipa that is very fruity, hoppy and easy to drink. Another amazing ipa from another amazing brewery!"
"Despite a couple drawbacks this is a fantastic beer. At times during the drinking and reviewing of the beer I felt almost as if I was nitpicking. The aroma is outstanding, DIPA hop aromas in a standard IPA. The taste starts off the same but it changes a bit as it warms. Perhaps this beer is best consumed a bit colder than normal."
"I like this offering more than Brown Shugga I gotta say.Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich light to medium golden with a creamy 1/2 finger white head atop.Big pith citric hops in the nose,the aromas really jump out at ya,pine lends more hop complexity,a sweetish malt base is also well represented,light sugary sweet alcohol as well.To me this is almost DIPAish on the palate,big citric juicy hops over top of a sugary sweet base,the good thing here is the hops are much bigger than the sweetness.This is a great beer,maybe a DIPA mini-me,this is some good hop juice here."
""
""
"The pour is a clear golden color with a white head. Somewhat hoppy with a nice citrus and floral hop character. There's a little phenol, maybe some white pepper. Sweet pale malt and bread notes. The flavor is quite similar to the aroma. A lot of citrus peel and floral hop flavors. A light spicy hop character, too. As with the aroma, malt and sweet bread flavors. Medium carbonation and body."
""
"Very enjoyable. Wish it was year/round. Nice and chewy."
"Overall/Drinkability-Screw Brown Shugga, make this the winter seasonal! Goes down smooth and easy and keeps me wanting more; a class IPA."
""
""
"overall, just really impressed with this beer. fantastic, wow-factor IPA. can only hope it finds its way into the regular lineup at some point."
""
""
"O – I enjoyed this one immensely, with only the lack of carbonation keeping this one from being among the best IPA/DIPAs I've had."
"Overall great but just missing some balance. The tropical fruit aromas are phenomenal, and the flavor comes out great at first, but without the malts to balance the bitterness and resinous flavors start to come through a bit too much and drown out the great fruits."
""
"Overall Impression- A top A-IPA I've had in a long while! The hop aroma was so great, I could order this brew and just promote it on the basis of the aroma! The taste and mouthfeel were fantastic too with its big time citrus flavors. Enjoyed greatly and ready to have again!"
""
"Overall this is one of the best tasting IPA's I've ever had. It rivals Heady Topper, Abrasive and Furious. I hope that Lagunitas can't ever get their shit together. Keep sucking!! Please!!!"
""
""
"The pour is what you would expect from an ale, gold in color with a one inch head that disposed quickly. A cool note is that it continued to effervesce til the glass was empty. The smell was awesome with hops and citrus. Mouthfeel was thin as it should be. The taste was really nice and dominated by hops with a mild citrus on the short finish. Overall a really nice beer. Crazy that this might be a one off, I would buy this year round! Nice work Lagunitas!!!"
"Drinkability- very good, well balanced, good hop flavor, nice to see another christmas beer that is an IPA"
"Overall this is another great offering from Lagunitas which to me is an actual holiday (winter warmer) since it's more malt forward. Sucks is actually very good!"
"O – Lagunitas you suck for not making Brown Shugga’ this year, but I am happy with the replacement. Would love to see this be added to the year round releases, but doubt it will happen. Again, Lagunitas makes a solid IPA, WINNING!"
""
""
""

"Well done for a substitute."

"Overall: Thanks to Olive Tree for selling singles or I might never have tried this. Now I'll get a 6 pack. This is very good. Perhaps I should try more beer from Lagunitas."
"O: Pretty happy about picking this up. It struck me as an odd seasonal but I was very pleasantly surprised. Will definitely buy again soon."
"Crystal clear gold with a small, off-white head on top. Super deep, fruity hop nose...dank hop oils, tangerine, grapefruit, mango, some malt sweetness. Delicious oily hops flavor with surprisingly little bitterness. Sticky, resinous, buckets of fruit - orange, pineapple, mango. A little leafy and flowery. Very, very tasty. Slick, oily medium mouthfeel. Not especially holiday-like in any way - pretty much like many other Lagunitas beers - but very hoppy and delightful."
""
""
"O: This is an awesome IPA. Very fruity and a complete 180 turn from the traditional hop overload, rip your tongue off, west coast IPA. Very drinkable. I hope once Lagunitas starts making Brown Shugga again they don't abandon this one. This is a huge success."
"All around good...taste is not overwhelming, but nice and balanced. Its so drinker freindly that I think this should make it into their regular line up; be it a seasonal regular or year-round."
"wow, laguintas really does suck! not because they didn't release brown shugga, but because they have been holding back this beautiful IPA from us! please don't make this a one-off brew. i would not mind seeing Pils or Hairy Eyeball get replaced with this one."
""
"overall: a very good balanced ipa with some good kick to it. IBU's say 60 something, but it tastes stronger than that. i dont really get the christmas tie in other than the label, as there is no flavors that bring out that feeling. i could be drinking this in the middle of summer for all i care!"
"the 5 American IPA's that I have tryed thus far). singing """Lagunitas Lagunitas I adore you""" .... then out of the corner of my eye I see the 	guys with the backwards fittin white jackets headed my way ..."
""
"Overall I am not missing Brown Shugga at all this year. What a fantastic beer. It reminds me a lot of Hop Stoopid, but it's lighter than that, it actually reminds me a bit of Kill Ugly Radio. The malt bill is different, but the hop profile tastes similar to it, and that was my favorite Lagunitas beer. I really hope they rebrand this beer and make it available year round or at least seasonally. I never thought I'd say this but replace Little Sumpin Sumpin if you have to, this is a winner!"
""
"O - It is pretty decent for an ale, but not something I expect for a seasonal. If anything I think this is an IPA. But it is not something I wouldn't buy again."
"Gold body with small creamy white cap. Lacing is moderate. Clarity is nice. Carbonation is speckled throughout the body. Great aroma. Citrusy and resiny. Lemon, tangerine, cannabis, norway pine...very nice. All that translates nicely to the palate, with primary flavors of pine resin, pot, clementine and lemongrass. Really qutie nice. Mouthfeel is very agreeable. Moderate carbaontion and medium bodied. Bitterness is quite evident, but not too jagged. Forget Brown Shugga. Bring this back again next Christmas."
"Pours a clear light honey orange with a 1 inch fizzy off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of lots of tropical and citrus fruits mainly. Taste is of malt, pine, citrus zest, and tropical fruits. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good IPA with the tropical fruit aroma and flavor that I love in hoppy beers."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear white amber with a small white head that has alright retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is some pine hops, some light grapefruit, and a bit of caramel. The taste is some sweet pine and citrus, and then some light caramel. The finish has a light bitterness. Light bodied. Medium carbonation. Overall, I found this beer to be a bit boring."
"O-This is a real nice beer. I was rather surprised that it had so much to offer and I do hope they make it again. My only complaint really is the lack of originality. This beer I feel like I have had many times before, there is little to add. I enjoy that something of such high quality is distributed so far and wide and tastes this good but there are many other options that kind of blunt the power of this one's appeal."
"I think the aroma wins here, but a really good ipa with a cool name. This brewery rocks"
""
""
"Not only does this beer not suck, it is down right terrific. The tropical fruit parfait, sticky sweetness and full bodied creaminess work in perfect unison. I will certainly not miss Brown Shugga if I have a supply of these on hand. A must try. No excuses."
""
"Keep your """spiced""" seasonals...I'll have this instead!"
""
""
"I will miss brown shugga and make no mistake, this in no way replaces it for me, but ya gotta love the brewery. Lagunitas sucks. Too cool, they own up and make a fine brew."
""
"Light body, medium carbonation. This really is a perfect summer beer.... brewed for the holidays! Maybe they'll never make it again so enjoy it while you can."
"O - This beer as an IPA is very average to me. Rate beer calls this an an American Strong Ale, and, if I were to rate it as such may score it slightly better."
"3.5/4/4.5/3.5/4.5"
""
"Final thought - $9 a six and almost 8% and taste like sticky icky"
"Moderate carbonation and a somewhat light mouthfeel. Lots of pineapple, pink grapefruit, and tangerine up front followed by honey, caramel, and a fruity/floral tang on the tail end mixed with mild pine. Not too bitter but bursting with hop flavor. Hardly any alcohol presence noted -- this one drinks easy but packs a lot of flavor."
"O - I wasn't expecting this beer to be so damn great. I'll take this over Brown Shugga any and every year."
"Overall- I usually don't like IPAs that are this sweet but this one is not that bad. Maybe I am partial because it is Lagunitas and I love them. Who knows? 3.5/5"
""
"Easy drinker, as usual Lagunitas kicks ass!"
""
"O: This is a really well done beer by Lagunitas. Great holiday offering pick up if you have the chance."
""
""
"O - very good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"I liked this overall but prefer their standard IPA. This is just a little too sweet."
"Kinda bummed that I won't be able to try some Brown Shugga this year, so hopefully this stuff is turns out to be a suitable-enough replacement. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises orange rind, light lemon zest, pine resin, light leek, white grapefruit rind, and a nice undercurrent of rich caramel. The taste seems to simplify things a bit, focusing on the pine, grapefruit, and caramel. Yeah, it energizes all three, as well. Some mild balsa notes linger in the finish. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very solid IPA. 'Nuff said."
"Overall this is a good IPA, not what I was expecting from a holiday ale, but Lagunitas knows IPA's and this is good."
"O: Good stuff. Ventures away from the usual piney/citrusy hop bitterness and towards the apricot/tropical fruit taste (and smell). Nice surprise from Lagunitas on that front."
""
"Thanks to emerge077 for sharing a bottle before I can buy it in Milwaukee. Must pick up a 6 pack or two when it is available."
""
""
"O. This is another great hop centric offering from Lagunitas. There's plenty of hop goodness here but in a nice, easy drinking way. Another reviewer compared this to HopSlam - that is pretty apt - call it a baby HopSlam."
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow! This has to be one of the biggest surprises of the year. I love Brown Shugga' and I would love to see it made again, but I'm not going to complain this year. Lagunitas has crafted IMHO a classic no-coast IPA. It doesn't have that dank bitter pop of the West and its not too sweet to be East. Its that super aromatic, tropical fruit blend in the veins of GI, FFF and Bells. I wouldn't be upset if Lagunitas replaced their IPA, PA, Maximus, or even Hop Stoopid with this stuff. Awesome brew!"
""
"O- I actually prefer to have this over Brown Shugga. This could be my favorite offering from Lagunitas. Really nice balance and the abv is hidden very well."
""
"O- Very surprised by this. Seeking out more tomorrow!"
"o -magnificient, just outstanding."
""
""
" ( I still want some brown shugga though)"
"I'm happy to report that his beer definitely does not live up to its name. It is an excellent brew in all respects and while Lagunitas is sad they weren't able to come out with Brown Shugga this year, they've most certainly made up for it with this gem."
""
"Overall, a stellar showing from Lagunitas. Miles ahead of Maximus and right next to Hop Stoopid in terms of quality, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I find this to be a very good IPA and would easily take this over the normal Lagunitas IPA, which itself is quite good."
"O - good stuff. Great stuff. Like her a lot. Going to do a zombie dust side by side soon."
"Overall – Fantastic. I love a heavily citrus forward IPA and this does not let down. I feel I may go through the whole six pack tonight."
""
"Overall, this is probably the best surprise of 2011 for me at least. I could care less if Brown Shugga' is never made again! Just a gorgeous, flavorful, and classy IPA. Love it."
""
"Overall - I've been a self-described critic of Lagunitas. This one though, changes my mind. It's a solid IPA and very nice for the Holidays. Flavors present were great. Well done."
"Overall, a very nice IPA, Lagunitas might suck for not producing Brown Shugga this year, but this is yet another fine offering from the folks in Petaluma."
"clear rich golden brew puts up a 1 1/2 finger head and laces the glass very nicely - aroma of hops - piney and fruity - grapefruit and bananas - taste is fresh and hoppy with a sweet malt backbone - good body and nicely crisp with a finish that begs for the next sip - real good stuff - not nearly as heavy or sticky as the beer it's subbing for."
""
"O- Pretty solid IPA"
"12 ounce bottle, $9.99 a 6-pack. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head. The small head did stay around a while, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice and hoppy, it smells mostly like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with a little bit of sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's full of pine and citrusy hops, and some sweet malt is noticeable too. There's a bit of sweetness in this brew, but it's still mostly hoppy and has a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little slick and sticky with good carbonation. I think it's a pretty good brew, not a bad way to make up for the lack of Brown Shugga this year!"
""
"This year's batch just as delicious. So damn tropical. Heavenly aroma."
""
""
"Been dyin to try this one! Pours a beautiful, sparkling clear golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is WOW! Awesome citrus and tropical fruit aromas that remind me Port Mongo or Avery Mahajara. Inviting piney forest aromas. Just smells extremely fresh and hoppy. Oh yeah, this beer is good. Damn good. Taste is initially bitter hops with profound hop resin flavor. Then you get a bit of mango and pineapple, which transforms into grapefruit and orange. Lovely pine flavors throughout. Nice and sweet without being overly sweet, that finishes with lovely bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied that finishes crisp...but it's weirdly sticky in a way. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer lived up to the hype. Honestly, I would prefer this over Brown Shugga. In fact, probably my favorite IPA/DIPA from Lagunitas."
"O- Would i recommend this beer to someone else? Absolutely. This stuff is bomb. Its no brown shugga, but I will gladly drink this anyday of the year. If your a Lags fan, this will not dissapoint! The best of an unfortunate situation! (Regarding the no brown shugga this year)"
""
""
"The Anti-Brown Shugga, and I'm happy they went this direction. What a great beer. I hope this isn't a one time thing. Bring this back next year!"
"Nothing mind blowing, but a solid hoppy brew to itch that hop fix for the Holidays at a very reasonable price."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: With the high original gravity compared to the ABV, I expected this to be sickly sweet. It isn't but it still has some considerable malt flavours. But at its end this is a hop centered beer, fans of Lagunitas' hoppy stuff should like this."
"O: this is a nice change from the typical winter seasonal, I for one can live with this alternative to Brown Shugga', a nice fruit foward citrusy IPA."
"Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer. Didn't even know it was an IPA. Just snagged it from the shelf and drank it. I was very happy with it from a completely unbias, uneducated manner. Grab one if you get the chance, if not because you love pine-tree hops, but because the whole Lagunitas Sucks thing is funny as hell."
"Well done."
"Update: I went to one of my favorite stores and they have had a run on this. They only had a few singles (an I bought them all). Apparently they had a tasting event there yesterday that included this and it was a big hit. I concur!"
"This is why Lagunitas is awesome! I didn't expect anything less, and they delivered."
"Overall, I really like this beer. I'm a hop said and I can say I like this better than Brown Shugga'. This is a great beer, and I would even go as far as saying this is a must try if you like Lagunitas."
"O- Quite a surprise. I'm sad to not see Brown Shugga' this year but being the hophead that I am, this made for a very welcome replacement. Lagunitas sure can make IPAs with the best of them!"
"Maybe a decent release in another season, as a Holiday Ale, not a winner for me."
"O - Wow. It's definitely not trying to be Brown Shugga but this is a great beer in its own right. Frankly this is one of the best beers I've had from Lagunitas. It reminds me of a more refined version of fusion VII (which reminded me of a more refined Hop Stoopid)... Damn. This is good. Would be a great beer to session with if you aren't driving. Highly recommended!"
"O: Another score for Lagunitas. I was very disappointed when I heard that they weren't releasing Brown Shugga, but this definitely makes up for it. Hop heads rejoice, this brew is brimming with big floral/fruity hops!"
