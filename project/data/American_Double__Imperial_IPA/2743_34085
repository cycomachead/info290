Taste is bitingly bitter from the hops and some of the pineapple and citrus is lost because of this. Alcohol can be felt(ABV 9.0%) but is not too much to turn you away from this hop bomb. Mouthfeel is decent, but slightly biting, obviously from the insane amount of hops and the ABV. Hopheads should like this one just fine. Aftertaste is decent and little more of the citrus releases at the very end..","hophugger","Mar 09, 2015"

The body was clear, and a couple of shades deeper than amber. The head was two fingers thick at first, but settled down a little smaller afterwards, and there was a steady stream of gentle carbonation. The aroma was prototypical DIPA, in the form of grapefruit, and was quite strong, as it hit me even at an arms length. The first sip indicated a hop bomb, as the bitterness was bracing and bold. There was a lot of citric tasting hop acids, and they were supported by a biscuit like malt backing. The finish was bready, and the hops lingered on. This was a well crafted DIPA, and should be taken as a textbook example of the style. Everything here was just as it should be.","rajendra82","May 24, 2014"

I noted before that this one was nearing its enjoy-by date, so I'm going to assume that it's not as fresh as it could have been, but that didn't hinder its enjoyability at all. It was still a hop bomb that provided everything I look for. I wasn't floored by it, but I enjoyed it more than the standard fare. Would really like to try this again, but a bit fresher.","ThePaintedGrey","Apr 06, 2014"

Recently I have discovered other small breweries that are making very high quality beer. I feel blessed to live in Northern California and have so many quality beers being made in the area. Sacramento has and will have many small/startup craft brewers around the area. Many of these places are open only a few days a week and the beers are not being bottled,just served on tap or growlers to go but the quality is still very good. Its great to see people working and enjoying beers like other people in the past did with wines.","sderenne","Mar 15, 2014"
4.14,1.2,3.75,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Enjoyed over the course of an evening, poured from the bottle into a pint glass. A light orange amber, just grading into bronze color with a large quantity of whitish foam on top. Nose is resplendent with leafy, floral, piney, and spicy hop aromatics, with some citrus and tropical notes apparent but more of a floral green spice up top. Palate is a yin-yang esque nigh-perfect integration of sweet and intensely bitter (or perhaps juxtaposition is a better word, as the flavors remain separate). Initially I get fresh orange juice and cotton candy, followed by a pulverizing blast of pine needles, quinine, black pepper, light onion/garlic and toasted crusts. There's the sweetness again, this time calling to mind orange creamsickle, tangerine and perhaps a little grapefruit, grape skins, peach. A lot of fruit flavors and there's gotta be hop varietals in here besides just Summit and Nugget, although there's more than enough green flavor and pungent spice to successfully ID these. Heavy duty stuff but has some of the flavor complexity of its little brother, West Coast IPA. The hops are aggressive but fail to overshadow the sweet malts, although I will say that the bitterness gathers steam and near the end I am getting that euphoric spicy numbing that I crave in this style. Pretty thick and syrupy yet smooth and drinkable (perhaps that's the endorphins talking). Fits the West Coast mould but maybe less tropical and more earthy/spicy than others. Haters gotta hate, but Green Flash has at least one diehard fan up here.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 12, 2014"

4.41,7.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had been meaning to try this for some time now but my quest for a relatively fresh bottle had been unsuccessful. Alas, found some about 6 weeks old and for $5.99 a bomber, I figured it was worth a try, a good decision in the end. This was an interesting brew, pours a clean deep golden colour with a small head. The aroma is a little weird, lots going on with distinct pine and citrus notes, coupled with some bready and oniony notes. The summit hop really has a presence in this beer and the taste is initially dominated by this. However, as you work your way through, the flavours become more complex and some tropical fruit (pineapple and peach) come through, couple by plenty of pine and bitterness. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer extremely well balanced with a light malt backbone; not heavy/syrupy like some big DIPA's. Initially, I wasn't sure what to make of this, but by the time I finished, I was a convert. I could see why some might not be and from experience I have found summit-heavy beers to be not so appealing. Green Flash got this right though, it is extremely well balanced and the flavours actually work very harmoniously. It is one of these beers that keeps you interested from start to finish so very much worth a go. A love it or hate it kind of beer in my opinion.","davet100","Aug 31, 2013"

I didn't look up any reviews on this. I just saw IPA so I bought it expecting an overly bitter beer that only a few might enjoy. However, I was wrong. This beer was great. It was a great starter pale ale for me as well as for the others. I know some of the more experienced IPA/APA people who can gulp down Stone Ruination without making a face may think it too sweet. Instead, just think of this brew as a crossover beer for those of us unused to the bitter side of the beer world. The color was pretty with a frothy head. The smell was flowery hops and sweet fruitiness. The taste may not have been the hop bomb that most people expect, but it I know it was plenty for me. Whether this was the intention of Green Flash Brewing or not. They sure did change my mind on IPA s. For this reason I congratulate this beer for being an excellent crossover brew into the world of hops. Now excuse me, I have some exploring to do.","AmishLightning","Aug 15, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy pale golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, honey, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus notes with light-moderate bread/honey malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, floral, grass, pine, honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bright citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, cracker, bread, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral hop flavors; with a moderate honey/bready malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA Style! Great balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral/pine hop flavors with moderate bread/honey malt balance; and very smooth to sip on for being over 9%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 16, 2013"

Citrusy and malty to the tongue with more smooth, oily hops at the back. Well-blended alcohol with just a bit of heat in the back.

Topped with puffs of bright white head that falls to small islands in the beer with lots of thick lacing. Nose of sweet and thick hops like an orange or lemon rind. Taste follows suit with lots of citrusy hops that have a lot of strong bittering, very stereotypical of a good west coast IPA. Dry finish with a little alcohol burn, but not really demanding on the palate. Little bit of a spritz to it as well. Overall, this is a very good DIIPA, which I come to expect out of pretty much anything made in San Diego.","estlinska","Mar 12, 2013"

Pine dominates this beer, with citrusy notes and a slightly sweet undertone. The alcohol is masked perfectly as well. This IPA is a 9.4 ABV but drinks like a session ale. Unbelievable flavor and character. Mouth is extremely smooth as well. So crisp and refreshing. Not too heavy and not too light. You can't call yourself a true hophead without trying this.

The smell isn't as delicious as the actual taste of it, I guess? That's a valid complaint, right? Also, the appearance of it misleads you into thinking it is a normal beer as opposed to the alcoholic cornucopia it actually is, so that is definitely another valid complaint against it. It's also kinda pricy in BC, which kinda sucks if you get addicted to it, much like how it sucks when you have to pay for crack cocaine.","smekermann","Dec 25, 2012"

The competing vibrant aromas of pine, citrus, floral, and roasted grain with a little sting of alcohol in the nasal passages comprise the bouquet. Mouthfeel is soft, full, wet, smooth and is balanced with a slight carbonation scrub and hop burn at the end. Nearly no alcohol warmth, flavor, or booziness. Dominating flesh flavor, cannabis, and peat up front imparted by resinous hops with peppery spice. It finishes with a little more of a sweet citrus. I'm digging this one.

The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving some lacing behind on the glass. A small cap of head is left behind atop the beer. I pick up aromas of citrus hops with that typical West Coast smell of orange and grapefruit. There is some sweet malt in the background. I can pick up some of the pine aroma as well. The citrus hops are more forward here, followed by some piney bitterness. The grapefruit and orange flavors are juicy. The sweet malts provide a nice backbone. There is a piney aftertaste, leaving some lingering bitterness in the mouth. Even at 9.4% ABV, the alcohol is not very noticeable. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is an excellent DIPA.","acevenom","Aug 06, 2012"

3.43,-16.1,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the variety of hops. These were great, but they just got lost amongst that madness that is the rest of this beer. The aroma is so strange, with sweat, dirt, and plastics as the primary trifecta. This carries over to the mouth too, where those components present the same problem. It would have been nice to have the sweetness appear a bit sooner, to better balance the bitters, rather than having a strong one-two knockout with two separately intense flavors.","TheBrewo","Aug 03, 2012"

3.78,-7.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a blast of dry, tongue coating hop bitterness that's countered by some faint tropical fruit, pale malt and strong alcohol flavor. Hits of pine needle, pineapple and grapefruit are quickly countered by bread, biscuit and boozy heat. The high abv isn't very well masked and it takes away too much of the hop flavor for my liking. Still, a really solid interpretation of the style. Just a bit too boozy for me.","corby112","Jul 29, 2012"

It retains the dryness and medium-low sweetness of a regular IPA while reaching a beautifully in-your-face amount of bitter, fruity hop character only possible in a DIPA, and without becoming syrupy sweet or overly resinous and cloying. Just an amazing beer I wish I could find more often. Highly, highly recommended to lovers of the hop.","hagbergl","Jul 25, 2012"

A good astringency from the hops came through in both taste and smell. Tasted like a grapefruit and a mango got together. The feel of this beer is almost kind of pulpy, It has a rich feel and I feel like tiny little hop particles were filling my mouth. It goes down rather smooth and I cant taste the 9.4% alcohol but I could feel it a little.

A bit of slightly too ripe pineapple. Taste is bitter resinous oily hops. Again the grapefruit aspect is slightly over ripe. Might be from the high abv. Good amount of malts but not enough for my liking. Mouthfeel is quite good with just barely enough carbonation. Alcohol is actually well hidden so watch out. Nice bitter medium dry grapefruit finish. No freshness date that I could find. Would like to try it on tap sometime. I down rated the drinkability a touch due to the 9.4% abv. Not a session beer unless you are a very large person. I am more than halfway through this bomber and it still has a cap of head after a good ten minutes. It would be much better with an abv of about 7.5% IMO.

A small amount of malts back it up. The taste is very hoppy, without being very bitter or very sweet. One of the most "balanced" DIPAs I've had, and I'm not using the term balanced as a euphemism for sweet like some people tend to. It'll hit you with the hops all night long, but it'll still call you back in the morning. The mouthfeel is a little undercarbed for my taste, but otherwise full and coating, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a very good double IPA that just falls short of the top tier.

Very strong and bright grapefruit and citrus - juicy and fresh! A hint of pine in there as well. I can't do the nose justice enough - it's really bursting out of the glass like none other! The taste is magnificent as well - very bitter, just the way an Imperial IPA should be. Has a taste that can be described perfectly as cannabis! Earthy & resiny. The initial smacking of flavor on the palate still is the sweet citrus however, and it warms nicely going down. No malts detected whatsoever. It fully coats the mouth, like velvet, with a nice crisp finish. One cannot tell that this beer is over 9% by any means, so watch out!

4.09,0,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, pale, honeygold-yellow coloring with a thin film of white, frothy head. Aromas of citrus and berries, both sweet and robust, with a heavy backbone of resiny, wet, rich hops. Flavors are hop forward, and they bring the thunder. Very rich, mouth filling hops profile, peppery and resiny, with a heavy oregano and grass character, as well. The citrus shines through as a very tart and crisp grapefruit highlight, and it helps to cut the richness of the hops. A light caramel malt flavor balances everything out. The aftertaste is more of the hops spicing, with a tart and bitter citrus effect, and the slightest hint of marijuana. The beer clings all over the glass while you drink, and the finish is slick, and slightly lingering. Great representation of the style, and it definitely represents the West Coast. Delicious!","GarthDanielson","Dec 23, 2011"

Taste mirrors nose, some light caramel notes, resiny on the backend, got more bitter as it fully warmed. Mouthfeel is just on the full side of medium, creamy smooth, decent effervescence. Nice, but a bit boozy, certainly within parameters of SD IPA style, makes me wish I had a Poor Man's for comparison. Worth a try for hopheads, recommended.","jdense","Dec 10, 2011"

Buying Green Flash in the Midwest was a crap shoot, since the lack of bottle dating sometimes resulted in the purchase of beer with spectacularly faded hops. My impression is that shipments to Tokyo are probably smaller and sell more quickly, perhaps ensuring better freshness.

A nice sturdy white head up top leaving minor stick. Smell is light grapefruit with a small amount of bubblegum and sweet malt scent. There is cabbage and dead veggie smell, sulfur, nasty musk after some warming. Taste wise GF Impy has grapefruit with minor amounts of other tropics, small pine, and a nice pale malt backing. This takes a complete 180 in the middle turning to sulfur, plastic, throwup and just plain nastiness. Hard to put down and harder to describe. Feel, GFIIPA goes down like a single and does not have the extra sweetness I find in alot of doubles. Carb is fine.

The nose comprises pine resin, light cilantro, lemon zest, light orange rind, light grapefruit peel, light biscuit, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine resin and cilantro really taking control of the situation, ensuring my tongue understands that hops are now in charge. Indeed.

Wonderful grapefruity citrus nose with a reassuring hint of grainish malt. Bitter, but not just straight up bitter...bitter with flavor of grapefruit, or orange rind...bitter with a backbone of flavor. Bitter but in balance with a sweetness that brings harmony.

It still manages to give a bit of balance and the complexity of the hops help it to keep from seeming one-dimensional. It has about 1 1/2 dimensions, but it still has something.

Strong, potent hops fill the nose, and not much else to say about the aroma. Big, big hops on the tongue, with bitterness of citrus zest. Some pine and grass in there, but it's the hops that you notice more than anything. Bitter and very dry finish. You're left feeling like you've just had...an imperial IPA.

3.45,-15.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Green Flash Imperial IPA, despite the many reviews, is to me a pretty average IIPA. IT has a lot of tropical and dank hoppiness but also a bunch of sweet fruity flavors and biscuity malts. The color was darker than I was expecting and it was (to me) too sweet for what I consider the hallmark of the style--Pliny the Elder. I had no problem finishing the 11 oz from the bomber I split with a friend, but I would find it hard to drink much more than that due to the cloying and lingering bitterness and sweetness.","Soonami","Apr 27, 2011"

The beer was rich with more classic American citrus hops, along the lines of Cascades, though I don't think those are used here. But it's the same sort of earthy, not quite catty, herbal grapefruit and pine character. There's a big, sort of thick caramel malt and bread backbone that's a little fuller than I'd like.

You could notice the hops right after opening this one. Great citrus scent with a bit of sweet malts. The taste is very piney with a caramel malt flavor that is not too much...making it a great candidate for an awesome west-coast DIPA. The hops are not overly bitter and the beer just blends all its flavors so well. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy with a big, bold full-body. The alcohol is SO WELL HIDDEN for how high the ABV is.

Hops are present, but it's more mild and balanced than I would have expected. Not a significant malt presence either. A little bit of grapefruit coming through.

Problem (if one can say it's a problem) is that it is merely a maltier version of the WCIPA which breaks no new ground nor is particularly representative or respectful of the style (which is kind of an amalgam of styles at that). In that sense, I have a similar complaint to the one I have about their Hop Head Red which, though a well crafted effort;,./, seems to me to be a WCIPA version of a red ale.

The color is lighter than a lot of imperials, less orange and more of a yellowish amber. The hops have a big sweet, citrus fruity aroma. They smell pretty fresh too, which hopefully means this bottle is relatively young. The hops don't come across on the palate all that well though.

A heavy dose of malt as well, making the feel thick and syrupy, but ample carbonation makes the mouthfeel good, very understated on the tongue. I've never had an Imperial IPA that tasted so damn heavy on the malt, yet so damn bitter with the hops, I almost wish one would dominate the other so they weren't fighting the character of the beer.

The nose was pine, lemon and grapefruit. Taste was sweet and soft. The Pine is upfront but the citrus and a sweet malt underbelly make this more than a burn-your-mouth hop bomb. There was a pleasing, mildly bitter aftertaste. Although it does not feel thin, it is soft and smooth for an Imperial IPA.

A very sharp bitter aftertaste that lingers is present. Bitterness sticks to the roof of your mouth for a long time.

4.42,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This is a very bright and drinkable DIPA with an out of the ordinary hop profile. The hops are very strong, but much like DFH 90, there is more than an average amount of malt balancing. The hops are exceptionally fruity with a character that, more than anything else, resembles candied oranges. The malt is big and sweet, enough so that it makes the bitterness seem much more mild than it must be, but it finishes reasonably dry and makes for a balanced beer. This is quite drinkable for a beer of this size and depth and I would highly recommend it.","nickfl","Dec 03, 2009"

A good hop taste with citric notes but I was expecting a little more hops for a DIPA. Well-balanced, medium-bodied, with a smoother finish with a little sweet malt thrown in (even a little sticky and bready in the finish).

Unfortunately, the taste is dominated by aspirin bitterness from front to back. usually with a DIPA you get an aromatic hop hit before bitterness takes over - not here. The bitterness so dominates that other flavours are flattened. I prefer more flavourful and aromatic hops. YMMV. Mouthfeel: medium body, appealing carbonation. Reasonably quaffable overall, but nothing I'm dying to return to anytime soon.","stagger","Sep 27, 2009"

The citrus peel and peach sweetness is there, but not in the amount I was expecting. The finish has a biscuit and grass duo along with a very faint but unusual anise / mint quality from the hops.

No other IIPA I've had has a bouquet that's so fresh and inviting. The IBU's don't seem noticeable at all, and this is THE beer that I'm thankful comes in bombers and not sixers; I can easily see myself downing three or four of these before I realize I'm out for the count.","ahpark","Apr 01, 2009"

Smell is pure hops with some citrus. If you like hops, you'll love the smell of this one. Taste is excellent; surprisingly, malts come through up-front and then the primary taste is well balanced off with the hops. The finish is hops as you would expect, but you can still taste the malts. Beer is light on the palate and the ample carbonation helps the beer dance across the toungue. I enjoyed this beer tremendously.","Nick3","Mar 31, 2009"

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a small off-white head that left some surprisingly nice lacing for such a high ABV. Aroma is piney with hints of orange-like citrus. There is also a huge peppery and herbal like spiciness to the nose which is quite different but nice. Taste is nice and bitter, plenty of grapefruit and pine resin, a solid cracker-like malt backbone, and again with peppery spiciness and herbal notes that were in the aroma.

Peaches, apricot, pineapple and subtle citrus fruit in the nose, fresh and grassy almost in character. The aroma is balanced with a strong underlying malty sweetness. Big hop flavor, fruit flesh, this is the juiciest DIPA ive come across. The herbal, cannabis like hop character really stays with you long after the sip. Just enough alcohol presence to keep things interesting, just drying enough to let the beauty of the hop really shine. Wonderful medium body, low/moderate carbonation feel, and IMO, very quaffable.

Engaging aroma of wet hop gardens with spotted clementine notes and sweet cream. The taste catches me a little off guard: pine, earth, wet hops, damp bitterness to finish and a medicinal alcohol aftertaste that lingers. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with almost no carbonation.

Aromas of carmel, custard, and amber syrup jump up as it warms. Taste is complex. Oily wood, resin, and spice lead into booze. A winey apricot emerges between heavy draped lacing. Tad bit piney, and at times reminiscent of sap and saw dust; a slight chew. The 9% is open and boasting.

The smell is hops and sweet malt as soon as you breathe it in. I find some fruity and citrus in there as well. Wow the taste is hoppy 101 IBU's, tart and sweet malt flavor just like it smells. The mouth feel is medium and crisp with Grapefruit flavor in there with a bitter bite. Hops and malts balance this beer out so the high 9% ABV is almost unnoticeable, until it gets to room temp then watch out the alcohol flavors start oozing out.

It is bready and grassy with a note of hay. There isn't really any sweetness or juiciness. It's savory. A well done Imperial IPA.","yesyouam","Feb 10, 2009"

The carbonation shows verve to break through the overall density and oily texture. While certainly hoppy, not bitter, no pucker, more like an exfoliation.

It pours a vaguely cloudy copper-gold under a one figure off-white head that settles slowly but steadily to film and collar, leaving a bit of lace on the side. The nose is strong of pine and carnation - very enticing, if perhaps a touch one-sided. The mouth is mildly carbonated and quite heavy, almost but not quite sticky. The flavor is strong, with coniferal hops everywhere. Some sweet malt, almost caramel, is ever present, but never above the surface, only cutting a bit of the edge off the hops. The bitter is achingly dry, like eating a pine cone - delicious, really. The alcohol is barely discernible, as the hops dominate everything all the way through to the dry, pine sap aftertaste. I have only one bottle, but wish I had more, as I'd be happy to keep drinking this. This brew is a perfect example of what I miss most about being in the States.","Globetrotter","Dec 23, 2008"

The piney taste is there but it is not upfront, and there is not much else going on. This beer is full bodied and almost chewey. A sipper, not because of the hefty ABV, just a heavy beer.

Pours a bit paler than some 2IPAs, with a big, beautiful frothy head and one of the longest lasting, soapiest lacings I've ever seen for an India pale ale. This beer looks excellent. Flavor is a bit citric in order to combat the excessive hop bitterness, but still doesn't feel as balanced as the better 2IPAs I've had such as DFH90 or Lagunitas Maximus. Definitely worth trying but the best part about this beer is the look about it.","Vendetta","Dec 14, 2008"

Of course, i get the natuaral comparison between hops and weed, but I did not realize how literal it was in this tap, until I actually tased some. Inevitably this lead to my own pint to close the night. Over all, another winner from Green Flash.

Strong hop aroma dominates the nose, floral, citrus and pine leaving not much of anything else to be detected! The first flavors are a shock of bitter and tart hops, fresh hops, grapefruit and lemon. A cookie-like malt provides balance and really helps the brew become more drinkable as it warms. The sharp hoppy character hides the high ALC% and also serves to clear the palate at the end leaving a long, green finish. Medium carbonation.

This had great head retention until almost my last sip, and left decent spotty lacing on my pint glass. The nose is no surprise for a San Diego style DIPA. It has loads of fresh citrus fruit leaning towards mostly grapefruit with pine and a certain earthiness that comes through, but not with much potency, and I think that works well for this offering. This is a very pleasing nose to this hop-head. The flavor profile almost does a 180 though. The pine and earthiness that was more muted in the nose comes out full force upon first sip with plenty of bitterness and pine needles. The citrus flavor comes in about mid-drink with plenty of grapefruit and tropical fruit into the finish. The malt tried to come in, but just didn't have the power to get over the hops. The mouthfeel is bordering on full bodied with low carbonation, and the warming alcohol is quite well hidden.

From the moment I had popped open the bottle, hops hit my nose and the presence of the hosp only got stronger the closer I got to the beer, obviously. It's a pure, fresh hop aroma, like there are hops floating on top of the beer; wonderful! Some malt comes though as well. The taste is also heavily of fresh hops, but the hops are more earthy and woody than citric...a very nice quality. Again, very fresh tasting. The bitterness is rounded out by the big malt bill.

4.18,2.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The hazy golden amber color is lighter than most that I've experienced of this style. An aggressive pour yields way more than a full finger foamy light orange tinted head that resists fading. It leaves impressive sheets of Belgian lacing in its wake. The smell is aggressive and primarily piny grapefruit over a sweet bubble gum malty character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is compellingly hoppy. A HUGE amount of quality ingredients were sacrificed to bring you this top shelf product. This is clearly a celebration of hops! The tangy hop resin texture of the mouth lingers on and on and on...which I personally find "over-the-top" and 'way above' the "standard" for this style. Full flavored, the grapefruit hop taste is EXTREME. The 9% ABV sneaks in beneath the HOP BOMB. Beware...this beverage will get your attention. I highly recommend this one to anyone...and oh by the way, feel free to stray beyond the box and celebrate the creativity and imagination contained there in.

The aroma is a hop smack in the face. The aroma is mainly piney hops but hints of grapefruit and lemon come through. Also the malty sweetness comes through at the very finish and its kind of blended with an alcoholy kick. The taste is big on hops, of course. Pine, grapefruit, slight bit of grass and sweet melons come through. It's really the whole hop gamut on this one, and the best thing is all the flavors are melded together, they are all pretty distinct. The sweet malt backbone really helps balance the beer very well. The mouthfeel is full and coats the mouth with a hoppy goodness. While it's over the top hoppy it is balanced and makes for an awesome DIPA.","hwwty4","Jun 08, 2008"

The taste starts off grassy but is quickly neutralized by a sweet honey bread malt. I must say I prefer my DIPAs to be onesided on the hop side, not balanced with a sweet sticky malt flavor. Anywho, the feel is moderate, with tingly carbonation, finishes with rough bitterness. Initially the alcohol is well hidden but after a while it shows up as some belly burn.

3.65,-10.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22 Oz Bottle. Lemon, cat and Simcoe heavy aroma, dosed with heaps of resins and cones. Mostly piney with nips of orange liqueur. Pours a sainted clean, clear gold with a rim of linen white. On the mouth, initially a standard double IPA, with bristling pine cones, warm bready sugars, and a whole chaotic swirl of hop characters. A halcyon of cone production. This sorts out into a drier, bitter herbal quality, with the malt falling behind and finding a seat behind turpentine and grain alcohol. A nip warm and nosing, but generally composed of pleasing hop flavors. Im not sure if I would have chose to build this beer with only Summit and Nugget, but as a duo they mostly get the job done before losing to a scathing bath of grass alcohols. Unique and somewhere in the field of decent west coast IIPAs. Some weird awkward tropical fruits and coarse grain characters show up down the line.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 23, 2007"

I'm thinking some chilling may have improved the mouthfeel, but it's really pretty undrinkable.","clickpush","Apr 24, 2007"

4.17,2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A "San Diego-style IPA" as it says on the label...known for being super hoppy. Just what I needed after a long day of field work, a hop-infused kick in the ass! This beer poured a nice clear copper color with a strong white head that clung to the upper rim of my tulip glass. A pungent and beautiful aroma of dank and herbal green hops with a whispering of pine forest and cannabis was the first thing I noticed. After warming, and a few swirls, I was able to conjur up a fruity, almost champagne-like aroma that came through in the effervescence. The aroma seemed to have many layers, and evolved as the beer warmed. The taste of the beer also really shows off the hops, with notes of pine resin (not unlike some of the flavors in retsina, a Greek wine made with pine resin), fresh herbs, grass. Lots of Nugget and Summit hops used here, as mentioned on the label, and the 101 IBU rating reflects this. Some cookie malt flavors were muted to the background and really only provided a base for which to showcase the hops. I thought the consistency was very good for the style. With the 9% ABV, a little strong for too many but still drinkable if you are in the mood for a hop bomb!","jletts","Mar 21, 2007"
3.83,-6.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The pine and grapefruit come through pretty strongly in the flavor. IBU's off the charts. If there's any malt in there, I don't really see them, which I think detracts overall from the style and beer in general. Very good in and of itself.

Pure hop nuggets assault the olfactory glands on the first whiff ... wow ... quite the tease for the hophead like me. As I begin to drink it, the utter oily, resiny hoppiness starts pouring down my gullet before the first bit of liquid touches the lips. Surprisingly the beer itslef is less brutally hoppy than all that aroma suggests. Instead, its nice and even-keeled with a decent citrus hop flourish, but without being overwhelming. Still a lot of resiny, oily hop here, but blended into a light-to-the-lips beer. Wow. (#2758, 3/18/2007)","Braudog","Mar 18, 2007"

Now, i know that hops are botanical cousins to cannabis, but goddamn. Aromas are strong in that department. The volatile hop oils transfer to the taste, where the flavors are too overwhelming. Nice bitterness, but its all too much in the end. Malts are not really present, not that your numb tongue would be able to discern them. Slight alcohol burn. Smooth and dry finish.

Citrus aroma, grapefruit, some lemon and a soft powdered sugar sweetness. Some fresh grassiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows the aroma closely with a light citrus sweetness up front that is slowly overtaken by a grassy dry and fairly bitter finish. Medium in body, a low to medium amount of carbonation. Alcohol is slightly evident in the finish but is fairly well balanced for its size.

My kind of nose for an IIPA. The flavor is pretty good too. It's got that grungey, resiny, oily hop feel to it. I get a hint of garlic on the palate as well. The malts are firm. They don't stand out obviously, but they don't fucking back down either. Toffee and caramel come to mind in this malt backbone. Alcohol gives a little bit of a lingering spiciness. But for 9%, I really don't get much on the buds. Very interesting and quite good. I could drink a few of these.

Now I don't mind bitterness, but if there's no hop flavor to go along with it, then it's pointless. I couldn't find a date on this bottle, so I'm almost wondering if it's a little past its prime or otherwise tainted. If all the bottles taste like this, then I would recommend staying away from this beer. I've had this brewery's barleywine and it's much better, so I'd suggest going with that instead.","vtfan77","Feb 25, 2007"
