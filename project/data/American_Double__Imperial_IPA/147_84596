Tastes of dank bitter hops, and an aftertaste that hints back at the sweet citrus and bread.  The hops are the defining characteristic.  This is a bold IPA to be sure.  Really an awesome imperial that lives up to the hype.  I'll be looking for another sixer of this at the next release.","anteatr23","Yesterday at 02:53 PM"

Had a really nice, thick head on the beer, with a really nice amber color.  The taste was really great as well.  Pick up a really nice hoppy taste, as well as a nice citus grapefruit taste.  Wasn't very bitter at all.  With it being 9.4% alcohol, was very surprised at how smooth this beer is.  Myself and my friends are now huge fans of this beer!!!!!","richwhite420","Apr 02, 2015"

A very pungent aroma that leaps out of the glass. The taste lives up to the smell- a perfect balance of dank, tropical fruit and pine needles. There is a gumminess on the aftertaste that, along with the grapefruit, pushes the bitterness away. The only knock I had was that it's just a little boozy on the back end.

It pours a slightly cloudy orangey gold with a nice white head that leaves some small sticky lacing. It has lovely rich tropical fruit, citrus and floral hops aroma. The taste is restrained for a Stone IPA, but it is still a delicious and well-made beer. The hops flavors are not overwhelming, but blend together well and are supported by a sturdy and subtle malt backbone. Not too heavy on the palate and with just a little bitter bite on the finish.","delta490","Feb 15, 2015"

Beer is crystal clear and medium pale amber in color.  Surprisingly tropical aroma, and fresh, of course.  Courtesy of Citra, perhaps?  Flavor is moderately juicy, builds pine, resiny flavors on top of the tropical fruit/passion/mango notes promised in the nose.  Surprisingly well balanced for a Stone double IPA, too.  I would even say the finish is not totally dry.  The headiness of this brew, along with the corresponding amount of residual sugar, are the only things holding back this otherwise supremely drinkable IPA.","hreb","Jan 24, 2015"

Very interesting flavor that transitions from malt to hop bittering with the PERFECT balance leaving no unwanted aftertaste; it even provides a deep earthy note toward the end that is very nice.  The carbonation is just so so to provide a great mouthfeel.  Interest lay enough, it is 9.2 ABV without tasting boozy.  Drinks like a session, so be careful.

This beer pours creamy golden, mostly clear with a very nice thick head and decent lacing clinging to the sides for dear life. Aroma is amazing with pineapple hitting the nose first, followed by hoppy, piney resin and other tropical and domestic citrus. Flavor hits sweet at first just for a second and then lets loose with all of the varieties of hops in an explosion !!. Pineapple and orangesicle dominates the citrus flavors and the hops provide a surprisingly balanced beer( There are many, many different varieties of hops in this one). Beer feels good and sticky going down and bitterness lingers on, but not too much. Carbonation is right and you can definitely tell this is a fresh beer.

Finally found one available in my home town (without an expired date! Chill bumps upon noticing in the cooler!) although if I find another tomorrow( as today on Christmas the store is closed) ,  I will buy another and drink right before i CANT enjoy by!! have very high hopes and I can say..... This beer is magnificent! Beer is an understatement.  From the smell to the Taste this fills all the gaps that other iPas lack, and I didn't even know they were lacking until I endured this HOP /FLAVOR  explosion.I wouldn't even say it is bitter like most iPas as the bitterness is full flavor until it completely fades from your taste buds. It has completely ruined my palate as I have read from others.. This beer sets the bar for all iPas for me at this point. And with an abv in the 9's I'm blown away more like 6's by taste.

The beer smells delicious, one of the best smelling IPA's my nose has had the pleasure of meeting. IT reminds me of frolicking, through the citrus grooves of California. I have never done that but that's probably what frolicking is like. The flavor comes off as a caramel sweet orange with some tropical fruit flavors. The beer isn't a display of hoppy bitterness tearing at your enamel as much as it is a display of the softer more  sensitive floral flavor and aroma of the hop.","i4ourgot","Dec 20, 2014"

When it does it leaves quite a bit of evidence of its presence. Nose has an abundance of tropical fruits and light sweet malty goodness. The two pair to create an olfactory delight . Taste builds from there. Hops hops everywhere and just enough malt to ride. While big and pervasive they are not a grapefruit bomb. Multilayered and multifaceted they display an attention to the smallest detail. The tropical side is dominant when colder with the lovely citrus showing its yellow skinned dry and puckering edge as it warms. In all cases the abv is a "Say What?". You can pound this brew and not know it until you wake up on the floor. Feel is medium heavy with a full creamy carbonation the enhances the overall quenching quality. It just drinks like a session ale. A superb beer in all aspects. I love the attention to the hop construct that drives a brewers vision to create something like this.","scootny","Dec 18, 2014"

4.18,-5.6,3.75,4.5,4.25,3.75,4,"Bomber poured into a tulip. Bottle best consumed before Boxing Day. No obstacles there. Dark yellow amber with a finger and a half of creamy, slightly frothy off-white head. On the light side visually speaking. Aroma dominated by tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit), tangerine, lemon, and peaches, with a subtle pine undercurrent. There is more pine on the palate (along with a decent blast of booze), with the nose skewing fruitier, although I am still getting copious quantities of tropical nectar and peach. Slight hint of onion. Very light malts, just a tinge of toffee. Comes off as well-attenuated, with little to conceal the generous hop bill. Somewhat woody and herbal on the back end but lacks the potent green notes one can get in less refined fresh hop ales. Less body than expected for such a "big" beer, dare I say on the light side, with just the right amount of mid-range fizz. I am temped to deem this Go To IPA's big brother, although that comparison does not quite capture the nuances. Suffice to say, this is a powerful brew yet somehow sophisticated in its lack of coarse bitter notes or green off-flavors. Nothing but tropical muskiness, citrus rind, and pleasant floral alcohols to nourish the beer geek soul.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 16, 2014"

The only downside is that the beer wasn’t all that balanced. It definitely hit with the hop bitterness, but it didn’t have enough malt backbone to make it more well-balanced. I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be an IPA, but it needs a tad bit more malt to up the complexity and overall balance. I would rate this a 90/100.","DaverCS","Dec 14, 2014"

Sticky, resiny hops dominate the nose along with hints of grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, orange peel, and subtle green onion.  The taste mirrors the nose with dank, resiny, earthy, fresh picked hops along with hints of pine, orange peel, grapefruit, tropical fruit, green onions, and just enough sweet caramel malt to keep it honest.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, subtly chewy, and extremely oily with a mouth-puckering crisp, dry, bitter finish.  Overall, I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for quite a while, and it did not disappoint.  Incredibly fresh and bold and every bit as good as Heady or Pliny!

I've had roughly 6-7 different batches of this, the first time I had it the beer was a citrus explosion juicy and delicious, the next 5 times it had an over powering onion taste that really turned me off. I had about given up on it but then I decided why not. Now it's herbally which is much more pleasant than the onion but I can't seem to get any consistency out of this beer which in my opinion makes for an average beer. However as you can see just buy the damn thing and form your own opinion on this one.","SomethingClever","Dec 12, 2014"

4.31,-2.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Fortunately for me it's not a heavy, bitter, and alcoholic double IPA. It's actually golden in color, and it's got a medium-full body with a moderate carbonation (kind of English in character). The malt is pleasantly straightforward and just lightly sweet and subtly biscuity and caramelish. Nor is it overtly bitter. Don't get me wrong, it's got bitterness to it, but it's not that harsh and raspy bitterness you sometimes get. What I was in the mood for, and probably what really swayed me towards opening it tonight, was hops - and it's got 'em, but again, I was surprised, I thought I'd find it drenched in resinous, piney, and citrusy hops but it's actually quite smooth and refined. All of those attributes are present but they're not "in your face", even in the aroma. It's also a bit minty, softly grassy, earthy, and gently leafy or tea-like, but the mildly citrus pith and gentle tropical fruit are what really define it in the flavor. It's really rounded and supple, leaving it remarkably drinkable for the style. The one thing that reminds you that it is a double IPA is the alcohol which peeks out here and there, especially as you progress through the serving. Still, this is one dangerously drinkable beast.","NeroFiddled","Dec 02, 2014"

3.5,-21,,,,,,"Very good looking beer when poured into the glass but the aroma was a bit weak considering this is a Stone IPA.  Decent hops taste but nothing overly special, but what really turned me off was the soapy like aftertaste this beer leaves behind. Looking back for an extra dollar I could have bought a six pack of some other IPA that's better or at least just as good.  I personally am getting a bit tired of companies thinking that just cause they put their beer in bombers makes it priceless when they don't make the beer itself worthy.","LXIXME","Dec 02, 2014"
5,12.9,,,,,,"A DIPA that absolutely gets it right.  Too many just don't have strong enough hop flavors and the malt ends up taking over, making them more like a hoppy barleywine.   Enjoy By brings the huge, dank hop smells and flavors that unmistakably put this in IPA territory.   Also appreciate the novel way to focus unavoidably on freshness through the prominent date on the bottle.","BikeChef","Dec 02, 2014"

Smell is largley a strong pine with some subtle notes of citrus like grapefruit, lemon, and orange. The taste follows the nose very closely and has a more balanced taste between cirtusy and pine than the smell does. There is a pretty large malty backbone in it as well. Medium mouthfeel with a good hop smooth hop bite on the back end. This beer reminds me a lot of a more hoppy hopslam. Solid brew by stone once again, but a slightly above middle of the road IPA.","mlhyatt","Oct 04, 2014"

This is my first time trying this beer and I always thought of it as kind of gimmicky or more of a sarcastic marketing response to the beer nerd community.  More than anything though, this is a fantastically crafted, amazingly tasting Double IPA.  It has a huge burst of tropical hop flavor and is not overly bitter.  I could drink this all day!","JednoPivoProsim","Sep 08, 2014"

Taste: apricot, peach, grapefruit at the end strong grapefruit finishing into bitter hops. Mouthfeel: smooth and fresh, not syrupy or sticky. Light crisp carbonation. Overall: terrific IPA, very we'll balanced and full of flavor.  wish there was a bit more complexity, but very enjoyable!","Bubbawilly88","Sep 06, 2014"

It has a very fresh aroma and nice earthy hop smell, with a sort of garlicky characteristic. The beer is interestingly complex with a ton of hop flavors: predominately resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange rind.  There is also a slight malt sweetness.

Good dense gold color, a little hazy, but normal for a DIPA. Good healthy one finger head which left slowly. Aroma is almost pure hops, with a backing of malty sweetness. A bit grassy in its hoppiness, along with pine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Taste is wonderful, full in your face hoppy bitter resinousness, backed by enough sweet malt to make it really drinkable. Again, a bit of green freshness in the hops, I'd compare it most to nopalitos or green agave, which accents the pine and grapefruit excellently. Finishes dry, hoppy, and leaving you wanting more. Great beer. My first in this series, but definitely not my last.","MikeI","Jul 26, 2014"

T- floral sweetness that hits side of the tongues and lingers a tang of grapefruit. Malt slightly present at finish but is over whelmed by those beautiful bitter hops whilst being layered with a resinous sweetness. M- bright with medium body. O- though alcohol is evident in the aroma it's presence is hidden by the glorious hops. Quite enjoyable considering the decent ABV. Paired perfectly well with a baked macaroni and cheese casserole.","Jefriedrichs","Jul 18, 2014"

Amazing nose... hoppy, citrus, resinous, other stuff going on. Bursting with flavor from the first sip BUT not so hoppy that it isn't balanced and refreshing. Would not think it was 9.4% ABV if it didn't say so on the bottle. Wish I had bought more than 2 bottles....","Vero-Dave","Jul 04, 2014"

This IPA is super fresh and has outstanding hops and citrus/pine taste. Goes down smooth. Pick up a few 22oz bottles for the holidays!","Frank_TX","Jun 27, 2014"

Huge deep malt sweetness in the nose with a wonderfully piney-citrusness. Same with the flavor, a huge malt sweetness with great caramel tones and a nice citrus start and pine end to the hop flavors. A bit thick and rough, but not bad for a 9+% brew. Excellent stuff.","JamesS","Jun 26, 2014"

If you want a hoppy double IPA that wont disappoint pick this one up soon. Only downfall with this brew is the relatively high price at over 8 dollars, so I had to reduce the overall score from 4.25.

A beautiful golden, slightly orange color to it. I poured it into an IPA glass very slowly so there wasn't much head but it bubbled around the edges nicely and stayed the whole time I drank it. For a 9.4%, there's no alcohol taste so it really creeps up on you. Fantastic beer. Hoping to get another pint before 7/14/14","bennettjd13","Jun 19, 2014"

Pours a cloudy amber color with two finger head that slowly dissipates and 20 minutes later remains to create lacing. Lots of floral notes in the nose. The taste is surprisingly balanced - I was expecting my taste buds to get knocked around by the hops, but they survived. The alcohol is well hidden so be careful!","dpkpr","Jun 18, 2014"

The aroma as I poured was intensely crisp with an abundance of pine. Once I dug into dinner and swallowed this lightly crisp, but very complex IPA I was blown away. This beer was promised as a fresh, but date driven determinator and it more than delivered an enjoyable experience. It's complexity isn't like the usual offerings in the IPA category. It offers something refreshingly different and makes me want to go get some more before July 4th.","thumperskibum","Jun 16, 2014"

Nose is grapefruit and most notable, tons of tropical fruit especially mango/papaya, maybe even some peach mixed in. Extremely fruity. Taste, unfortunately for me, follows the nose pretty close. I don't know the type of hops off hand but there's a hit of hoppy, piney bitterness and then another assault of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is what it should be, nothing to brag or gripe about. Overall, there's waaay too much of the tropical fruit sweetness for me. I just don't "enjoy" it. I'll still buy the next one though because this series from Stone is generally one I enjoy.","slackattack","Jun 15, 2014"

Super fresh and hoppy, very citrus forward, masks alcohol surprisingly (dangerously) well, very smooth. Importantly, no maltiness / sweetness which is sometimes a drawback of this style for my taste. If you're looking for a fresh, hoppy, big west coast IPA I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.","Subhop","Jun 11, 2014"

It pours wonderfully with a light bronze color and thick foamy head. My first inhale hit me with a dank citrus, pine scent with undertones of an earthy, fruity base. The beer itself is smooth and round with a crisp bite of citrus. Its fresh, bold and I love it!","AyeMito","Jun 09, 2014"

I had both the bomber and tap and although both were amazing, it was even that much better on tap. Stone beers tend to be past their prime by the time they get to my area, where the hops fade, leaving a malt and onion mess. But with this, I know each batch will be fresh. At just over a week since bottling, this is one of the freshest bottles I've ever had, and it shows. Enormous vibrant hop presence that I enjoy in an IPA without being too aggressive. We have a real winner here! Worth the $9 (with tax) price tag for a guaranteed fresh bomber of this quality brew. Can't recommend this one enough, and absolutely worth the hype. Enjoy!","Bone53","Jun 07, 2014"

That is an immense testament to their commitment, enthusiasm and influence in the market to prove their point. I have now tasted various iterations of this beer at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and post 90 days...although it is a delicious offering at any time, I am now a convert of enjoying this as fresh as possible since the tropical fruit notes sing the loudest and blend the best with the herbal notes. Time will accentuate the garlic/onion qualities that are only muted as a young beer. (5.0)","threeviews","Jun 07, 2014"

It does not disappoint at first taste, exploding with heavy fruit, especially grapefruit, and plenty of upfront hops. A bit of maltiness helps balance the brew, and masks the alchohol.

I know I am using a lot of punctuation to describe this beer, but what have I been missing out on? I have drank a lot of IPA's and DIPA's as of late and this one is the best I have had. I have never given a perfect score on a beer and I don't know if there is such an animal but this one is about as close as I have ever given. I just hope it doesn't become as hard to find as some of those others, which by the way I have never been able to get my hands on. So, maybe those are 100 beers. This one, is really really close to being my all time favorite IPA though. One complaint, at 9.4% you can't drink but one.","humuloner22","Apr 11, 2014"

It is a good beer and there is no doubt about that. However, it probably is not worth the $8 since there are other IIPAs out there for less that are pretty much the same. The aroma was "fresh," but that was about the only attribute that sets this brew apart from others in the field.","Ham-Nord","Apr 05, 2014"
4.79,8.1,5,4.75,4.75,5,4.75,"Finally decided to review this beer after many many bottles and a few on-tap. This stuff is good, like REALLY good. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher than it is really. This is a serious Imperial IPA. It tastes like one, smells like one, etc. Its probably a little sweeter and malty'er than any other double I have had, and I personally attribute that to the freshness. This months bottle, 04-20-2014 is probably the best one I've had. I'm sure that's just a coincidence... If you have not tried this offering from Stone, try it out ASAP. You probably are not going to find anything better anytime soon. There are few others out there that compete, but are not nearly as READILY AVAILABLE as Stone Enjoy By. Tastes absolutely fantastic straight from a bottle, but if you must, pour it into a glass and do all that looking and sniffing, then gulp it down all the same. Enjoy!","turbotype","Apr 05, 2014"

Semi-cloudy copper-orange with frothy 1/2” head on the first pour. 2nd pour was clearer and head was thicker, about 1”. Smell is intense, pungent grapefruit citrus, pine resin. The alcohol scent is apparent behind these as well. Taste mostly follows nose; citrus and pine, with an earthy undertone. Malt is understated. Not as tongue-coating as I expected, although the hops are definitely front and center; finishes fairly clean, considering the style and ABV. Medium-to-full-bodied with moderate carbonation.

Nose of sweet citrus (mango, orange) over a light grapefruit and earthy dankness background. Light medium bodied with a slick texture. Normally carbonated with no effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavors over a slight biscuit sweetness with a low level of bitterness. It begins with the sweet citrus flavors which are soon overpowered by the dank earthy hop components. While complex, the flavor is heavily "dankcentric" - lol. On the smooth finish, you get a bit of biscuit sweetness flowing into the dankcentric vortex coupled with a nice residual alcohol tingle at the back of the throat. An exceptional beer that those which wonder what dank means should try.","tillmac62","Mar 31, 2014"

Not sure what has happened to the recipe or if hops used are no longer cost effective but it is not the awesome hop head offering it once was in 2013.

Hop forward crispness with good balance and bitter hoppy finish finish, mild sweetness creates a hop/malt equilibrium.  I will eagerly await the next enjoy bye....

More than I expected from the last time I had it. I'd say my pallet is more accustom to IPA's now and this is why I rate this beer so high.","mattyjatz","Mar 25, 2014"

Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hops oils, slight floral hops, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of grass.

Pungent, earthy, citrus hop aromas with a hint of malty sweetness beneath. Smooth, incredibly delicate feel with gentle, lazy carbonation and an oily feel toward the finish. Flavor was similar to aroma. Pungent citrus, pineapple, and rioe grapefruit flavors uo front with a tangy hop bite through the middle. Caramel malt flavors peek through toward the end.

Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white cap that dissipates into a froth and then an oily slick that coalesces into a thin band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing and a random swath present during the tasting. Great nose - tropical fruit, citrus rind, grapefruit, spiciness and an herbal/piney character. Taste is less fruity than suggested by the nose. Much more of a malty backbone as well as a spicy character and rind towards the finish. An oniony character is also revealed as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a bright, prickly carbonation and a light acidity that stimulates that tongue and salivary glands. Overall, quite interesting, but I have to say that I wish the flavor profile was a closer match for the nose - a bit too much malt and spice and not enough tropical fruit for my sensibilities.","Jwale73","Jan 31, 2014"

She sent me for smokes one more time, damn. But came home with a nice lil 5 spot for the night. The Stone was the star but you cant beat 90 min. from Dogfish Head. It's epic and we all know it. The fact i had a Sixer of the the local Shipyard IPA was a bonus and that Black IPA is real damn good. Stone continues to deliver and to be fair I live out in nowhere ME so the fact I'm getting this beer is just plane awesome.

This one pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a generous white head that gives way to a gentle and lasting Frothy film and decent lacing. The aroma of this is slightly disappointing. At first it seems perfect with a nice sweetness followed by a ton of citrus and floral hops. Alot of grapefruit and mangos, some pine and definitely some skunky grass aromas. As I smell deeper im finding notes of garlic and scallions. Not sure if it fits in this super fresh dipa profile. The flavor is delicious...at first. Super fresh and hoppy, bitter and sweet. Very balanced. A lot of citrus, pine, grass, and some nice malt and yeasty bread notes. But in the aftertaste is still those damn garlic and scallion notes. Its not bad by any means just seems to negatively affect the freshness that this ipa is known for. The body on this beer is wonderful. Medium and a little sticky. Coats the mouth with hoppy goodness for a long while. This is a great beer and I cant wait to try the next date in the series, however I do not believe it is anywhere near Stones finest offerings. But for an allocated beer how can one go wrong at just $7.99 a bomber.","lochef81","Jan 28, 2014"

Overall this is as good as expected based on the track record -lots of hop flavor which is helped by the freshness which shows..almost chalky from the raw vegetal matter jammed in- this is a quality Imperial IPA, one of the best I have had in recent memory.","Slatetank","Jan 28, 2014"

Not really any malt balance on this brew, very hop forward, but what else what you expect from a Stone IPA? I've been drinking lots of brown ales and stouts lately and this was my first IPA back from my malty phase, I enjoyed this brew but its almost a little TOO sweet for me personally.

I had only heard good things from friends and BAs, but it's not quite as marvelous as I had expected. Perhaps it's because I'm inevitably comparing it to Abner or Heady, but it strikes me as a slightly better, more alcoholic version of Long Trail Limbo that cost me $7 a bomber rather than $10 a sixes. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it, I enjoyed it, and I will probably get another one at some point. Try it for yourself, because fresh IPA is hard to come by.","BTVflatlander","Jan 24, 2014"

The excellent appearance gives way to a strong sweet apricot hoppy nose that is simply delicious. On the tongue is it presents a strong hoppy bite. Behind that lies a fruity citrus that gives way to a wonderfully balanced lingering hop. In the mouth this beer is smooth, refreshing, clean and crisp. Quite simply this is a fantastic IPA. Certainly worth a night for the IPA lover. I don't advise is for a new drinker or non IPA person.","lsiberian","Jan 22, 2014"

The smell was amazing; it might be the best part of the beer, an insane combo of floraly hops with a soft piney caramel to it. The mouth feel, sort of gummy, chewy, beer with a smooth finish.

I want to try them all from the beginning but I don't know how realistic attaining all would be. And more important how fresh the tastings would be. Enjoy By will be enjoyed by most.

So it was with a little trepidation that I believed the hype on this beer. From the minute you pop the cap the hop fragrance takes hold of you. Smelled of weed and citrus, with a dash of pine. The first sip socks your jaw with hop pungency and light caramel tones. Then you notice the nice head and great color this brew displays. The alcohol is up there, being a DIPA, but doesn't overpower or take your buds off of the taste. Just enough kick on the back end. Very drinkable, and the mouthfeel is full, but not cottony. Overall one of my top 3 brews HANDS DOWN. Can't wait for 2-14-14...Get you some!","precisemike","Dec 19, 2013"

The smell is that of dank, oily, earthy hops, a bit of onion, lemon, grapefruit, and orange peel. The smell is amazingly fresh, so I would say Stone succeeded in what they set out to do. The taste follows the nose, delivering a resinous, mouth-coating blast of bitterness right up front along with grapefruit and orange notes. There is also a weird onion taste that detracts from the quality of the beer, but it's not overwhelming. The finish is dry and unapologetically bitter, leaving a tingling in the back of my throat.","itsscience","Nov 26, 2013"

Smell is massive grapefruit hops, some citrus, random hints of random fruits. Insane hop flavor right away! Heavy floral hops, then grapefruit, then citrus, then the massive bittering kicks in. Absolutely coats the mouth. The bitterness is a little higher than I usually like but the fresh hop character is astounding. Aside from the lingering bitterness, the finish is really crisp and dry on this - I just realized this is 9.4% abv and now I'm even more impressed. Way too easy to drink considering its strength.

Downing a whole bottle will make you woozy but with the appeal and bitterness of a Troegs Nugget Nectar combined with a rich array of sensual aspects and a chocolate-chili type aftertaste, there's a ton to like here. This was so clean and crisp that it misled me into thinking that it was an American Amber but alas, it's just an IPA that lives up to the "Imperial" moniker. Loads to love here, even without the date on the bottle. This was one beer that you'll want to drink as soon as you get your hands on it!","JerzDevl2000","Nov 04, 2013"

The lack of malt flavor makes this beer even more impressive because there are no detectable flaws in the flavor and it seems to be consistent from one batch to the next. The Enjoy By series proves that Stone gets it. They understand that the consumer wants a fresh product, which means a lot coming from such a large brewery that doesn't need to be doing this kind of thing to survive in the vastly expanding craft beer industry. I have the utmost respect for Stone because they have respect for the consumer. The fact that Enjoy By is such a fantastic IPA is just the icing on the cake in this situation. Would I drink it again? Yes, anytime I can get my hands on it.","JamesMN","Oct 26, 2013"

Initially upon opening, there is a nice hop aroma, but it attenuates slight soon thereafter. Big malt profile that overpowers the hops. No doubt that this is a double. Some apricot in the nose, but mostly hops and malt. The flavor is good, but the bitterness is a little harsh. Palate is perfect for a double. Medium carbonation that rapidly dissipates. It's a big beer. Well done, but a little heavy-handed. I like what Stone is trying to do here. I just prefer an IPA with a bit more balance.","chickenflea","Oct 23, 2013"

The amount of concentrated hop aromas, flavors, and acids that are packed into this beer is quite impressive. Yet it isn't so domineering, because I wish I had another bottle to drink right now. However, I think this beer is making me realize that I'm not a huge fan of double IPA's at this point in my drinking career, which is reflected in my overall score of only 4. With that being said, I can certainly still appreciate the skilled craftsmanship involved in the creation of this fine brew.","ElijahRivera","Oct 01, 2013"

You can pull out a huge array of hop flavors, and they all stand distinct, without a messy overall character. The balance is extraordinary, and that is an accomplishment in the West-Coast IPA style. The concept of this beer is awesome, get it to the customer as fast as possible and teach distributors about the importance of fresh IPAs. But, the execution was even better, Mitch Steele nailed this one.","Siriusfisherman","Sep 30, 2013"

4.42,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"1700th review! 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/9/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, peach, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of tropical and citrus hops with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, and light caramel on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity of big citrus/tropical hop flavors with surprisingly light pine presence; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA as expected. All around awesome complexity of tropical/citrus hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering.","superspak","Sep 14, 2013"

The aroma of hops jumped out of the bottle with fruity citrus notes, a bit of pine and even the dank hops I know and love. There are obviously a lot of hops which is to be expected from a Stone IPA, but they were handled very well. Loads and loads, but balanced so as not to give you the bitter beer face or palate wrecking experience of some IPAs. There were tropical fruits and citrus on the front end with the pine bitterness coming through on the back leaving a nice bitter coating on your palate. All of these great hop flavors were riding a danky hoppiness that held it all together. The Enjoy By IPA really handled the hops with a more delicate balance. One of my all time favorite IPAs.","brurevu","Sep 11, 2013"

There have been so many great new DIPAS out since my last Enjoy By in November, some of which I'd rate close to or even higher than Enjoy By, and it's still so expensive at $8+ a bomber, that I may well stop at buying one bottle per issue from now on. Consider Lagunitas Sucks (not new but the new issue is out, plentiful and relatively cheap), Green Flash Palate Wrecker, Sixpoint Hi-Res, Long Trail Limbo, Smuttynose Durty, Victory Dirt Wolf and Hop Ranch and Otter Creek/Lawson Double Dose, etc. Enjoy By is great, but new competition, some of which is at a lower to much lower price point, is making it less of a must-have IMO.","scotorum","Aug 25, 2013"

The nose gives a powerful blend of pine and citrus hops, with a hint of nectarine underneath. The first sip is wonderfully rich and complex, with an assertive (but not over-the-top) hoppiness evenly balanced with a subtly sweet caramel malt and an odd twinge around the edges that I just can't put my finger on -- maybe a weird blend of mango and onion? Very nice smooth texture, relatively full-bodied, dry on the upper palate. The finish is kind of short, but leaves a nice lingering bitterness. Overall, an excellent example of the DIPA style. Well done, gentlemen.","AnotherBeerGeek","Aug 25, 2013"

Poured a light golden orange with a one-finger head which dissipated almost immediately to a thin coating. While there was light lacing, it marked the glass throughout. The nose was oranges, lemon, grapefruit, mango, and pine. The taste was wonderfully hop-centric, with oranges and lemon predominating but the malts in the background ALMOST come forward for balance. The finish was only slightly bitter, moderately dry and slick. Beer was medium in body and somewhat oily with nice carbonation. None of these descriptors would necessarily suggest my conclusion that this was a GREAT DIPA. I wasn't prepared for HOW good, given my previous experiences with Stone's other Enjoy By offerings.

I mean there is no such thing as a perfect woman so I guess beer would have to fall in that category, please beer take no offense. I usually do not get excited about the color of a beer this one though has a nice peach looking color to it great eye appeal, just something a little different from other IPA's and their copper-orange color. Great hit of citrus when I stuck my nose in my glass, holy crud the alcohol content is hitting me already, WOW, and lingered well after the head fizzled down. The same with the first intake of the beer, real good citrus flavor followed by a smooth and mellow wheat flavor. For being an Imperial (double IPA) this is unusually mellow yet like I said holy crud the alcohol is hard hitting. This is definately not a swilling IPA, take the time to really enjoy this IPA, you will be pleased each pull on this beer is just as good as the first. The good thing is that the after taste of the beer does not hang around leaving you with that "I just licked a leather boot heal" taste in your mouth that some shoddier IPA's will have the tendency to do.

The concept was something I fell in love with the date is 8/24/13 the bottle says to drink by 9/13/13. Look it's expressive in appearance, copper bright body almost an orange layered hue to the beer with cream almost white head forms thick. Fine speckled lacing I'm again in love, why does this have to be the beer, one which sells out quicker than stores can get it in. Aroma has bright grapefruit, citrus notes that expel any notion of less than fresh hops. It's actually an explosion of hops withheld in a room of fresh hops, earthy qualities are dumbed down by bright citrus. Each gulp goes down smoother than the next, beautiful beer I'm drinking each sip thinking where is the next drink coming from that's a strong hook that radio DJs look for in every overproduced song on the market. This is not overproduced it's just the best quality beer of every quality IPA you have ever tried.

Alcohol is noticeable, emphasizing the brashness of the pungent hops. Faintly soapy as well. A little sweetness is present, mildly sugary with a burnt sugar effect(especially in conjunction with the hop bitterness). medium light in body, this beer is moderately carbonated and has a long, pungent finish that's a touch soapy. This is more of a bitter , dank west coast dipa than the more recent hugely aromatic dipas that are all the rage. Recommended.","DefenCorps","Aug 22, 2013"

4.71,6.3,4,4.25,5,5,4.75,"9/13/13 version. Pours a translucent, golden orange color with a finger length head that dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is amazing. Tons of of overly ripe pineapple, some grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach, more tropical fruit notes, pine, tiny bit of breadiness and sweetness from the malts. Taste starts with some bitterness, but more tropical and citrus fruits like pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, mangos, some floral qualities as well. Was already smooth on the front end, but then gets even smoother and creamier in the middle from the malts that somewhat balance it. Then finishes dry with more tropical and citrus fruits, as well as some pine qualities. Very smooth and crisp finish that cleans the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Has a slight sweetness throughout, which complements the hop characters and gives the hop flavors almost a gummy bear-like taste. High medium, oily body. No alcohol detected at all. From what I read, this beer is made with mostly flavoring hops and not many bittering hops. I agree with this, as there are just massive amounts of juicy fruits in this. Better than Ruination in my opinion. Well done!","brewskis","Aug 17, 2013"

However when it does make its way around, it's quite easy to find and priced about reasonably at around $6.99 per bottle (in this area at least).

4.95,11.7,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Based on the 08.02.13 batch. Poured a gorgeous clear amber, with a half finger white head. It looks fantastic poured into a tulip. Scents of pine, citrus, especially grapefruit, pineapple, slight tropical fruit and a bit of malt. The scent is fantastic and entices you to drink. Each sniff made me want to take the first sip more and more. Flavor begins with a burst of bitter citrus and grapefruit pith moving into a blend of grapefruit and bitter pine and finishing with a nice resiny pine flavor and aftertaste. A hint of malt sweetness in the middle blends wonderfully with the hop flavors and a noticeable alcohol presence hits at the end. An amazing double IPA flavor profile, comparing favorably with the best of the others of it's style I've tasted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's standard, but not bad. A sublime double IPA. Full of hop flavor, with an extreme bitterness and citrus flavors. It slams your palette with it's assertive flavor and doesn't relent. Well worth getting, a fantastic beer and a great showing from Stone.","Auraan","Jul 30, 2013"

The nose was fruity, floral, not too herbal or piney; I won't bore anyone with talk of lacing or head retention, lets cut right to the flavor. Oh my god. The marriage of fruity and citrusy hops is mind blowingly delicious and so different from the herbal, piney IPAs that Stone is known for. If you are a fan of IPAs, you must try this and see for yourself. I dream about this beer at night and think about it when I'm thirsty. I'm hooked!","Aaron_Ramson","Jul 25, 2013"

Pours still near chardonnay white to brilliant gold. Full clarity, not bottle conditioned like it should be. Medium, buttermilk head. Spotty lace. Nose is soft orange fruits, nectar fruits, peach, white grapes, Alpine style butterscotch, salted caramel. Yumm. Taste is oily, lightly bitter, not too aggressive, actually very soft with white grape juice, white peach, some white pepper. Very nice. Reminds me of Alpine Duet.

Alcohol clears the sinuses along with a wee bit of caramel in the background. Medium bodied and smooth, almost creamy, but for the carbonation Lots of hops in the flavor, as expected. Piney resin and citrus both contribute, but pine is the biggest contributor. A hint of malt brings it all together. Very enjoyable.","BeardedBoffin","Jul 14, 2013"

Perfect Pilsner-like color* For those who would argue that it should be more appropriately copper colored... *The first officially designated American craft brewed IPA was Grant’s, and it contained Pilsener malts of this golden hue. The nose is an exquisite melange of grapefruit, Mandarin orange, tangerine, pinapple, mango, kiwi, and lemon/lime. The flavors follow suit, and the body is medium to full with just the right amount of malt backbone which is more of a textural thing, in this case, than a flavor enhancer. The hops are given free reign to truly shine here. The balance is nearly flawless, right through the long, dry finish which is crisp, and remarkably refreshing. Wow!","Impfan","Jun 18, 2013"

I can't help but be reminded of the hoppy beers from Alpine when I smell this special offering from Stone. The hop scent on this is just so damn inviting, it's ridiculous. Sweet, but not malty...it's a sweet, hoppy resin aroma. Some pine and a ton of citrus fruit with a hint of pineapple and mango. Taste is just as it smells. It is so hard to explain this beer, because it is so delicious and everything an imperial IPA should be. So fresh and so clean...as Outkast would say. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. Drinkability is VERY high! This is a top notch IPA that reminds me of the quality that Alpine produces. Definitely my favorite hoppy Stone beer.","DovaliHops","Jun 15, 2013"

I can't really put into words the actual taste of freshness, but it was such a clean IPA. The malt backed up the massive hops pretty well, although lets be honest with ourselves, this IPA is not so much about the malt. I would love to get my hands on more of this stuff. If I were to compare to Pliny, I would say they are actually quite similar, but more grapefruit on the Enjoy By and more tropical flavors in Pliny. Enjoy by July 4th is truly a great beer.","brenty0man","Jun 10, 2013"

The alcohol is very present, but that is no reason to apologize. This beer is not for the weak of mouth. The appearance is also amazing.

Imagine that Stone had a Pliny the Elder recipe in their hands and said "let's do this, but let's do it our way." It is a very well balanced brew that doesn't rely on extreme hops to define itself.

This one leans away from the citrus side and goes more for the dankness. Taste is good, just like the smell. They did a really nice job of infusing the hop flavors into this beer. The hops are strong, but the beer is by no means bitter. Mouthfeel was good. Well carbonated, a bit of body. All in all, it's a very solid DIPA with great hop flavor, even though it's not quite the hop profile I would have gone for.","dougfur","May 25, 2013"

The beer gave off an intense pine hop aroma with maybe a slight hint of citrus. The taste was very good...the hops, while very very upfront were not so overpowering that I was turned off by them, as happens occasionally with some DIPAs. This might be one of the best DIPAs that I have enjoyed. The beer felt good and the beer was smooth, but drinkability does suffer given the ABV.

Not something I will get all the time, but not something that will just sit around and take up space. This was well executed with the hops shining and the malt really just helping to showcase the hops. I really enjoy fruity, slightly sweet DIPAs and this hit the spot. Surprisingly light and easy to drink really paired well with the flavors. Lived up to the hype I was reading and definitely worth a try. Great treat for every now and then with no concerns about freshness.","FreshHawk","May 13, 2013"

Taste is similar to the nose but even greater amounts of white grapefruit and black peppercorn that seamlessly lead into a sweet grainy, lightly boozy (not in a bad way) finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied (how one does this with a Double IPA clocking in at 9.4% ABV is beyond me ???). Carbonation is light, the finish is clean and smooth.

It has a decent body but I hoped it would be a little bigger and good carbonation that still tingles your tongue after you swallow. The fact that they hidnthe 9.5% abv makes this a great mouthfeel. This is a good beer and the one that had was from the 7th batch. It is the Enjoy By 5.17.13 and I enjoyed it on 5.11.13 so I was close to the expiration date.

Tons of tropical and grapefruit hop flavors with an undertone of piney bitterness. The taste presents a literal ton of tropical fruit and grapefruit hops, with a strong hop resin aftertaste. One-note, but tasty as hell. The mouthfeel is on the light side and fairly carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Stone Enjoy By is an extremely tasty and enjoyable IPA.

The aroma didn't do much for me, a touch of spice, and sweet and earthy/flowery smell. The taste isn't as sweet as I was expecting and, although I appreciate west coast IPAs, this one didn't really have the malt character to balance out the appreciable hops.

4.56,2.9,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a large snifter glass. The beer pours clear orange golden with a thick, slowly retreating white head and lots of tiny streaming bubbles. The beer has a bright aroma of grapefruit, mango, and peach, but also hints of pine and sweet malt. Flavors of grapefruit, peach, mango hit the mouth up front with the piney bitterness hitting in the back. Further sips bring in more piney bitterness, though this is milder than some of the West Coast hop bombs, and more of that malt backbone. Make no mistake about this one. This is geared towards hop heads, so you're not going to find an extremely balanced IPA here. Still, the malt profile is bready and has light caramel sweetness. Because of the lack of malt balance, this is a bit thinner than many DIPAs. The body is medium and the carbonation is moderate. The finish is slightly dry and the hops provide plenty of aftertaste. The drinkability is very high since the alcohol can't be tasted. This is an excellent beer for what it is. I can admire what Stone is doing for the marketing gimmick, reminding people that beer should be enjoyed fresh.","acevenom","Apr 30, 2013"

4.2,-5.2,4.5,4.5,4.25,3.5,4,"D/O: This is a solid DIPA with a modern hops profile. At almost 10% abv, this one is a sleeper that threatens to punish the overindulgent later. It masterfully keeps the hops qualities laser-focused on just the most appealing, never veering into the "kitchen-sink" territory indicative of many over-the-top members of the style. Beers like this are going to eventually demand that all brewers of fine experimental pale ales update their recipes. A Centennial-heavy IPA just can't measure up to the apparently Simcoe/Galaxy/Citra foundation that is faithfully transmitted here. This is indistinguishable from Lagunitas Sucks, which actually puts this beer in a position to apologize for being stronger by almost 2%.","beagle75","Apr 28, 2013"

Malts are more noticeable in the taste of this beer as it has a slight sweet edge, and in fact I notice that it seems to sweeten up a little more as it warms.

I actually shared a little less of half of this one for a friend's birthday. This beer really is just as I remember it, but that first time on tap seems to be a bit better. However, that could have been anything: a few days fresher, the physics of being on tap, the company/atmosphere, and even the nostalgia of it being my first time having it. I will say that this is one killer IPA that deserves its status, and is only like this because of the mandated freshness.

Hoppy yet, not nearly what you would expect from the smell. The feel was a bit thin too. I felt like for this double IPA, the hoppy presence peeks very quick then fades into more of a watery mouthful. Overall, I do like this beer but was expecting more from it. It did fall short of being a world class beer but I still enjoyed it. I do have another bottle that I will try as the first beer of the evening to see if I've been thrown off by the other beers.","sjones5045","Apr 27, 2013"

But, this beer sends a message to IPA beer lovers. That message is freshness. While it is not anywhere near the best IPA I have ever tasted, it is one of the freshest and I think that this concept is missing. As a IPA drinker I have been feeling that sometimes I'm cheated. Nugget Nectur ( I consider this an IPA even though it is an IAPA) is one of my favorites, but I always feel like I have to buy it when it first comes out. If I don't, I run the risk of buying an old batch in which the hops are gone and it taste not the way it is intended. Ever wondered about the "create your own 6 pack" special at some beer stores. Yea.. don't do it with IPAs because the single beers they sell in that form is always three months old. So... while it is not the best IPA, it is an IPA that I would rather drink than a 3 months old Hopslam. You have to respect a company that takes the quality of their beer seriously and that is why I will probably continue to wait and stalk a beer store for when they receive an "enjoy by."","mvice001","Apr 26, 2013"

4.24,-4.3,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"The beer pours a beautiful golden orange with almost amber highlights. It pours with a half of a finger’s with head of pristine white, small bubbles that all sit as uniform in size, and stay the same height on the glass, but fad to a scrim in the middle of the beer. The head leaves a lacing of thick, creamy bubbles on the glass, forming fat waves on the sides. In body the beer is clean with a slight chill haze and lots of little bubbles gently working their way to the top of the beer. On the nose, the beer is pungent from the minute the bottle is cracked. This smell is everything I expect from Stone, with big sticky resin on the nose blending beautiful into tropical and stone fruit notes of mango, papaya, slight grapefruit, and a kiss of boozy malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly bitter with a nice kiss of sweet hops, a touch of sweet alcohol, and some slight acidity coming off the hops as well. The flavors begin as sweet mango and papaya, which are quickly blasted away by dank, resinous pine notes that smother the bitters gently across the palate and give the tongue a nice shiver. Pinecone flavors meld and overpower a slight sweet caramel touch, while stone fruit flavors and a touch of pineapple gel in the background of the flavor. The finish is long, smooth, and bitter with medicinal and pine flavoring that works into the aftertaste of bitter resin, though the finish does showcase a hiccup of sweet and almost cloying caramel malt. In the mouth, the beer feels surprisingly fat and syrupy, coming in on the heavier side in body with a smooth and sticky carbonation that oozes the beer over the tastes buds. The mouth is left wet on the sides with a light dryness traveling up the middle of the tongue. Overall, this is good DIPA, and I didn’t expect anything else from Stone. It could use a touch more dryness to it, as the alcohol and sweet hops do provide hiccups of cloying sugar on the tongue and stomach, but overall, this is a beautiful expression of hops. The hop character is deeply complex and nuanced, revealing new flavors to the palate with every sip. It does sit a little thick in the stomach, though, and is definitely more of a sipper, but all in all this is a damn good DIPA with a great message about the life of hoppy flavors.","Maxwell","Apr 26, 2013"

My only "complaint" (not really a complaint just a comment) is that for a beer that advertises itself as super fresh and hoppy, it could be a bit more of a hop bomb. Compared to something like heady, the hop profile is not that insane. Still and amazing beer though.","nquigley16","Apr 25, 2013"

Citrus, pine resin, and freshly mowed grass provide a dominate hop presence in the nose, with just a touch of burnt toast providing any malty hints. Fruity citrus flavors, as well as caramel malt sweetness open up on the palate as floral hop flavors, and a bit of pine resin pull through the finish. The sweet malt flavors provide excellent balance. This amazingly fresh and tasty brew is medium in both body and carbonation.

The hop presence is bold and intense, but not cloying. They work intricately to create a balanced and tasty beer. If you can't get your hands on Pliny or Heady, try this one. A notch above PtE and a hair below Heady Topper. Must try.","gcamparone","Apr 01, 2013"

The beer pours average, no exciting appearance, nothing special with the head. The aroma is quite unique though. It has the basics of a West Coast IPA but more, there seems to be tons of varieties of hops, very complex. This strong hop flavor makes you forget it's over 9% abv. Although I appreciate all these hops, I feel like they could have been chosen differently to better compliment each other. All in all my opinion breaks down to this. Every other type of IPA I have had from Stone Brewing has been better than this beer, and they are all half the price. I was super excited to try this been and unfortunately I was disappointed. Save your money and buy the original Stone IPA, it is the better way to go.","vicg12","Apr 01, 2013"

I bought an 8 oz. snifter of the 04/20/13 on tap at a restaurant earlier this year on a whim and I loved it. This is the first time I had it since then and perhaps the first IIPA I have had since then as well. This beer is surprisingly refreshing and the alcohol is hidden very well. It CAN NOT BE TASTED AT ALL! For a brew approaching 10% that is very impressive. I have had some really HOT brews at 9-10%. Not this beer. I strongly recommend this to hop heads and anyone who is a craft beer aficionado in general as this is not a harsh IIPA. Bold, vivid in flavor-yes, but not harsh in alcohol or hops whatsoever-a WORLD CLASS BEER!","mitch3114","Mar 31, 2013"

What impresses me the most is the complicated hop flavor of this beer. Most DIPA's are strongly bitter....and that's it. This beer, while definitely bitter, is not nearly as harshly bitter as most DIPAs. The hop characteristic in particular is more complex than expected - fruity and floral with a nice resin base. I find DIPAs disappointingly one-note - I think this is the first that I would buy again. Nice job Stone.","MighHighBrewer","Mar 28, 2013"

Wonderful delicate floral aroma with some citrus blossom and a touch of floral honey. The taste is beautifully balanced with citrus, floral, herbal, and a touch of pine in the finish. Vibrant and fresh tasting with just enough sweetness to keep things zippy. A touch soft, but just a great beer all around.","Georgiabeer","Mar 24, 2013"

Nice fresh aroma of hops bitter notes. Skunky in flavor up front, with cherry and white grapes on the stringent finish. Pine-tar like consistency on the palate, and a lingering hoppy dry,almost rubber essenece on the finish. Overall, I like this hop bomb, from one of the Masters in the game.

This is one of those that changes with temperature, and has an evolving aftertaste. 6th batch was indeedly a treat; smelled and tasted herbal... Basil/rosemary/other garden thangs.

This one, however, is completely different. Very easy to drink yet still maintaining that strengthness thats become a hallmark of Stone. A complex mixture of flavors going back and forth with each sip. Excellent beer and very well balanced. I really love this beer.

Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-orange coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a thin, filmy, bright white head that recedes into a surface coat that clings to everything it touches. Aromas of resiny and piney hops fill your nose on every sniff. Tropical fruit and grapefruit sweet and tart ribbon through the aromas, also. Smells green and tasty. Flavors are amazingly balanced. Green, resiny, hoppy punch initially, with a dose of bitterness that quickly washes into a tropical fruit blend of mango and grapefruit. Resiny and bitter at the end of the palate, with a slightly roasty and tangy sweet caramel backbone coming through. Hoppy and peppery spiced aftertaste, with a bitter feel that leads to the clean, dry finish. Smooth and clean in mouth. This beer is tremendous.","GarthDanielson","Mar 07, 2013"

The smell of the beer is loaded with fresh hop aromas, big floral and citrus notes with a subtle malt sweetness in there as well. The taste of the beer is very good as well. The malt balances the bitter hops quite well giving this more of a sessionable flavor in my opinion. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth with a bit of oiliness to it. Overall I wasn't thinking this was an Imperial IPA, I was thinking it was just an amped up standard IPA. All in all it's a good brew and I'm glad to have tried it.

Excellent mouthfeel-just a huge body that is very well balanced against the enormous flavor. WOW! what a great beer all in. Reminds me of Moylan's Hopsickle just picked off the bine.

4,-9.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grass, grass hop, citrus hop, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grass hop, grass, onion hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one had a pretty big explosion of hops going on here while still managing to be refreshing. There was quite a nice balance here as well. The aroma is quite inviting and the flavor has just enough hoppy resin in it to remind you of the style it falls under.

Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit) and pine hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some lemon peel, floral hops and a bit of onion. There's an enjoyable bitter hoppy finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and sticky with moderate carbonation. It's also easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew overall, I hope Stone keeps making it (and Ohio keeps getting some). $6.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Mar 02, 2013"

The beer drinks very easily, like sugar dusted citrusy hops and has a mild, lingering grapefruit rind bitterness. It's certainly not drinking like a heavy IPA...as I'd expected with a 9.4% abv beer. The beer has near perfect balance, which is also surprising, as the intense hops and booze tame the sweet maltiness...or vice versa. Great IPA that drinks very easily and definitely hits the spot.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 01, 2013"

The aroma is outstanding; floral, herbal hops with hints of tropical fruit lingering in the back. This is a fresh IPA to be sure. More tropical notes and some citrus across the palate, and a fine balance between bitterness and maltiness. The 9.4% is completely hidden until you've had a few pours!

Maybe my favorite Stone beer, along with Sublimely Self-Righteous.","falc0n2600","Feb 25, 2013"

4.54,2.5,3.5,4.5,5,3.5,4.5,"2.15.13 version. Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head that slowly dissipated to a thin film with a thick ring around the glass and light lacing. Aroma dominated by herbal, earthy and almost dank hops, a bit of sweet malt in the background. Taste follows aroma with very complex herbal and piney hops with a hint of citrus hops. Supported by solid sweet malt, orange and citrus rind, finishing with a moderate hop bitterness and residual herbal flavors from the fresh tasting hops. Does not overwhelm with hop bitterness, but delivers intense hop resins and esters. Medium bodied. Definitely delivers on what it promises: as fresh and intense a hop experience as possible without excessive bitterness. A hop lovers dream. I have to say the presentation of this really went over the hype boundary, even for Stone, but it does deliver. I was so intimidated by the instructions to drink quickly that I drank this the evening after it arrived in town. I do not regret that.","LiquidAmber","Jan 18, 2013"

It honestly reminds me of a more over the top Pliny with a stronger emphasis on the more tropical side of hops. The previous batch I had,"Enjoy By 2/15/13" tasted a bit less convoluted hop wise, but Stone really, really impressed me with this one. Still no Pliny killer/contender, but this is damn close.

This beer is good but nowhere near out of the ordinary with the so called "freshness" not playing a role to me, i've had plenty of brews that taste as fresh as this one well beyond the maturity of this brew. I think the high ratings of this beer really come from the marketing that stone did. On the distribution and retail end of things, stone doesn't do much in the way of out coded beer for the consumer so I guess this is their way of moving through beer quicker without complaints. If this enjoy by series ever gets stale i'm sure stone will never really come personally pull them off the shelves and eat the costs.","jtierney89","Dec 04, 2012"

Tastes equally fresh and hoppily strong, but the flavor is tame and a near total lack of burn belays its elevated ABV. Lots of double IPAs attempt to back up intense hops with thick, syrupy malt. Other, better doubles balance out the hops with sweeter malts and interesting yeast complexities. Here, the hops don't get too out of hand, but they're still lush and variegated enough to balance themselves, making it so all the malt needs to do is provide a decent bready backend. and that's what this one does, gorgeously.","mynie","Dec 03, 2012"

4.61,4.1,3.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"This is a clear copper brew, shiny beneath a dense white head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is not what I expected, but it may be because this was served colder than normal. To say the hop aroma is strong would be an understatement. The biggest aroma is pine, but there's some grapefruit, floral, and lemon notes in there too. If there's a malt aroma, it's buried deep beneath all the hops, as it should be in my opinion. After a swirl, I get a solid biscuit aroma. The taste starts off coppery with white bread crust. The hop flavor is dominant as well: very vinous, earthy, and somewhat grassy. Bitterness comes smoothly, but it's unmistakably oppressive. There is some spiciness in the bitterness too, perhaps from Amarillo. Beer finishes coppery, earthy, and vinous. The taste delivers what the aroma promises. After all that, I thought: "what about the malt?" As in every good Triple IPA, this malt is just a stage for the hops. It's reminiscent of white bread and unseasoned oatmeal. The feel is balanced and finish dry. Although it's not malty, this is surprisingly balanced. This is a damn fine brew. Dare I say in line with Pliny!","Philousa","Nov 30, 2012"

3.9,-12,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Enjoy by IPA looks pretty clean inside the bottle, no sediment. Once outside the liquid is an olympic gold medal color with much clarity. Surprisingly with a stealth pour I only mustered about a quarter inch of frothy foam up top that dissipated and left no cling, a rather lifeless looking beer. Enjoy by has a healthy musk to it. I get swarmed with citrus scents and some bitter pine backing. A nice malty backbone as well, the alcohol does not seep through. Smells more on the tropic fruit side with some bubblegum coming up with room temp. Taste is what you would expect with a IIPA, rich tropic fruit flavor, mango, orange, grapefruit, a smidgin of pine, a nice crystal malt presence. This tastes more like juice as it comes up to room temp. Not as bitter as most stone IPA'S go. Body is a healthy medium with a pleasant bitterness, but more of a juicy finish, No heat from the 9 plus percent. Carbonation is surprisingly low from the get go, so perhaps I had an off bottle. This was drinkable, but something that i have had a hundred times over in different forms.","BARFLYB","Nov 29, 2012"

Upon closer inspection my nostrils are delighted by hints of bread and caramel that have been devastated by an onslaught of hoppy goodness. Pepper and green onions mixed with grapefruit pine and resin round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit sweeter than I imagined based on the smell. Solid shot of caramel sweetness up front followed by a hint of alcohol and a smattering of pine citrus and onion. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel.

As it warms, citrus, fruit, and sweet malts become more apparent. Citrus and mango show up to the party with sweet bready malts as their entourage. All this comes together with an alcohol twang that melds perfectly with the rest of the flavors and leaves a tingling feeling at the back of the throat, spiciness lingers on my lips long after it's gone.

Some citrus elements as well. This aroma is world class- I get some buttery sweetness (honey?) behind the pine aroma. Guessing Simcoe was a key dry hop used here. The citrus aroma is orange rind. Smells terrific. Taste- the fresh piney hops pop off my tongue, followed by a mildly sweet (not syrupy) honey backbone, finished by a lasting and delicious bitter piney finish. In my book, this is an absolutely delicious and world class Imperial IPA. Up there with the best on them. For the ABV, there is absolutely no hint of it being 9.4%, esp because the backbone doesn't have that bruising sweetness that you normally expect to achieve that ABV. The piney hops are delicious.

Once the beer settles, hop resin breaks through. The mouthfeel is peculiar and affected more than I like by the flavor. Mouthfeel should accentuate the flavor, the flavor shouldn't molest the mouthfeel. When first pulled into the mouth, there's a pleasing fullness that quickly is overtaken by the harsh hop burn and sting of carbonation for which Stone is so famous/infamous. Strong, resiny pine flavor that is, oddly enough, balanced with the grain bill. I'm not sure how much grain it would require to balance this hop assault, but they've figured it out.

4.5,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Much praise goes out to Stone for this one. It's a great concept, and quite genius really: market an IPA solely on its freshness date. Making the "Enjoy By" date glaringly obvious not only ensures that the consumer gets the freshest possible beer off the shelf, but it also goads them into drinking it within that freshness date. Everyone gets the optimal drinking experience, and brewery and consumer alike are happy. The execution of this concept was no easy task either, but Stone seems to be handling it very well. Brewing different batches for different regions of the country and staggering the release dates seems to be the only logical way to go about it. Even a larger craft brewery like Stone has its limitations when it comes to brewing capacity, distribution, etc. Everything seems to be going off without a hitch though. I have yet to hear a complaint stemming from any of the previous releases. Of course all of this goes out the window if the beer itself sucks, but suck this beer does not. In fact, to top it all off, this may be the best new DIPA I've had all year. It's incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, and it drinks like a dream. I didn't believe that it was 9.4% abv until I felt it. I'm calling in a favor and getting a ride from someone when I find this on tap.","ryan1788a5","Nov 21, 2012"

The nose comprises mango, light pineapple, light leek, dank-ish greens, sweet caramel in the background, and a touch of grapefruit peel. Were it not for everything else coming together so well, that leek would've damaged this stuff in my [nose's] eyes. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, pine resin, sweet caramel, orange rind, and a hint of greens. The fruits that are so fleshy and bright in the smell come through overtly rindy on the tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, fairly sticky finish. Overall, a damn solid IPA, one that seems to suffer from over-freshness (if you can believe that!): I think the hops might meld slightly better with a little bit of age on this stuff.

Medium white head. Fine bubbles. Some lacing. Aroma is full of bright hoppiness. It's a mix of floral, sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Some things that come to mind: sweet grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple, papaya, kiwi, lavender. Very nice. Little to no malt contribution. Maybe just a bit of simple sweetness. The taste is chock full of hop flavor, and the bitterness is tuned just right for my palate. There's no bland bitterness to this beer. It's always complex and delicate hop flavor. Absolutely wonderful taste. Mouthfeel is light. Gentle carbonation. Long-lasting hop finish. No booziness. This is an excellent DIPA. I tried the first version and was less impressed, but perhaps, I didn't have a big enough pour or something. This beer is tasty. If you like hops, I can't recommend it highly enough.

4.3,-2.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Stone's Enjoy By IPA pours a translucent tangerine, with some goldenrod highlights. Two plus fingers of frothy white foam cap the beer and show some decent staying power. Lacing reveals the head to be fairly sticky, but it doesn't absolutely coat the glass like the best do. The nose is absolutely fantastic. Waves of mango, pineapple, and gooseberry come through, with just a little bit of grapefruit thrown in for good measure. If the aroma was just a bit more pungent, it would be perfect. Each sip greets my palate with just a little bit of malt, some light caramel and bready notes. The hops are a little more unbalanced here, with lots of mango and white wine grape here, and just a little bit of the more citrusy flavors. The Nelson Sauvin hops actually get just a little overbearing at times. Still though, the flavor here is one instance where I wish scoring was in quarter point increments so I could give this beer its full due. The mouthfeel is superb, highlighted by an unbelievably light and lean body. I've had 6-7%ABV IPAs with heavier/chewier bodies than the one I find here. The carbonation, while lively, could stand to pop a little more. I love the idea behind Stone's Enjoy By IIPA, and this super fresh hop bomb lives up to its promise and then some. I'm just glad NJ was one of the markets to receive it.","axeman9182","Aug 26, 2012"

Finishes sweet with grapefruit rind bitterness. Heavy malt backbone, medium carbonation and silky, smooth on the palate. A solid DIPA from Stone, but certainly not heads or tails above others, and tends to be more of the same and is a bit overly sweet. Personally, I prefer a finish that is a bit drier, and the finish on this brew is about as sweet and fruity as one can find, with the usual grapefruit rind bitterness. Frankly this brew is a bit unbalanced, and those that prefer sweeter characteristics in their DIPA's will certainly be all over this one.","chanokokoro","Aug 25, 2012"

As others have noted this beer reminds me a lot of Nelson. Which is perfectly fine by me as that is a stellar beer. Get this while you can if you can.","jdhende","Aug 23, 2012"

4.81,8.6,4.5,4.75,5,4.5,4.75,"Light golden color and you can easily see right through this well filtered beer. Hop aroma is present a good distance from the nose. Hops are strong on the spices - almost fresh cracked pepper and basil - with a small amount of citrus. Some malty sweetness on the backend but certainly not the star. Thank you Stone for enforcing freshness of this hoppy beer.","Oakenator","Aug 22, 2012"

The novelty of the whole thing adds a great sexiness to the whole experience. I'm glad I could get more than one bottle of this, and look forward to sharing this with others. Good job, Stone. Keep this stuff coming!","iwantsomerocks","Aug 21, 2012"
4.92,11.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Stone continues it's roll. This innovative release program rewards those who keep it fresh,and move it quick. After all the videos and how too's I finally get my hands on a fresh specimen today. Having enjoyed, very much I may add, the Ruination Anniversary as a youngster, and thought the 16th was OK I really had no idea what I was about to fall into. This pours a pale copper, the cap is dense, white and recedes rather quickly. My first inclination that I'm into something special is when I bring my tulip to my nose. Seriously, the most intensly aromatic nose I have ever enjoyed from Stone. Very Alpine Nelson meets KRBC Citra nose, totally intoxifying. It just gets better as the flavors fall in line with the nose delivering sweet mango, tangerine, lemon, orange and white pepper notes. There is a beautiful bitter blast from the enormous hop bill, just enough malt to keep it all in balance, remember this is totally a west coast variation, so were talking hops, dry and fruity. The mouth is dry, clean and utterly refreshing, there is absolutely no detection of the 9+ abv lurking underneath the entire package. Gains complexity as it warms and never is hot. This would be Stones biggest seller by a land slide if made available year round. If you can find a fresh bottle now do what you have to, it's that good.","OTB","Aug 21, 2012"

This is definitely less malty IMO, with a great hop variety. They're the 2 best beers I've had from Stone. I don't think this can disappoint any hop head. I've had better IPAs, but this is definitely up there.","nrs207","Aug 21, 2012"
