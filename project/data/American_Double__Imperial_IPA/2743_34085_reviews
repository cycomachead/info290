"Excellent example of a US Imperial IPA."
""
""
""
"Just as the big old """imperial""" on the label suggests, this is not a subtle beer. It casts a maelstrom of roaring magic hoppiness that few can endure, and even fewer can enjoy. But those of us who are acclimated to such hops hurricanes (you know who you are) will find that there's nowhere they'd rather be than in the middle of a glass."

"Pours a light, clear gold. Head is ample and fluffy. Lacing is spotty but nice. Aroma is a snoutfull of piney hops, pineapple and other assorted citrus, wow !!!!!!. Taste is bitingly bitter from the hops and some of the pineapple and citrus is lost because of this. Alcohol can be felt(ABV 9.0%) but is not too much to turn you away from this hop bomb. Mouthfeel is decent, but slightly biting, obviously from the insane amount of hops and the ABV. Hopheads should like this one just fine. Aftertaste is decent and little more of the citrus releases at the very end.."

"O-  Green Flash delivers again."

"O- It's a big beer, maybe a little too big (sic). Lots of flavor, abv, sugar."

"pour out of 22 oz bottle.  9.0 by volume not 9.4 and different label than depicted at time of review.  Light golden colored IPA, minimal white head. Very piney on the tongue, almost to a fault."
"O - Outstanding and just well put together on all levels. The vegetal onion/garlic notes really set this one apart from some of it's competition and border on divine to this taster. Why am I not drinking more Green Flash brews? A """quick rebuy", meaning I'll probably run out and get another bottle as soon as possible."

"O:  A fantastic Imperial IPA.  Hops are in your face from the nose all through the taste with a slight reprieve at times from the malt.  Great flavors and good complexity although not exactly 'balanced'.  If hops are your thing buy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried at local piZza joint before ordering and was very impressed by the hoppiness appearance and overall flavor.  Not overwhelmed at all by the alcohol content, which is truly amazing in my book"
""
"There is an overpowering smell of onion.  I really enjoy it when I don't smell it first."
""
""
""
""
"I'd buy again and again. This will fill the spot of the Green Bullet when it not in season."

"Overall  I was scared to try this since I HATE their west coast IPA but enjoy their Palate Wrecker. To me its somewhere in between but very balanced and drinkable. LOVE the not so lingering hop bitterness. Well worth the price!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A well-done, above-board IIPA with an overall zesty hop character and mildly sweet malt grain profile. Balanced and complex throughout and does justice to the American hop-bomb styling of an India pale ale. It may not be the biggest, most brutish example of huge hop presence in a beer, but it certainly stands head and shoulders above most of the competition."

"A great DIPA. Gotta try it."
""
""
""
"O: It's okay. Certainly, I've had far better IPAs/DIPAs (from this very brewery, actually). There's just nothing here that excites me - and I expect to be excited by a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: really great stuff - features Nugget and Summit hops - a real tight, crisp and delicious DIPA. Git sum."

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 5/23/2014"
""
""
"I love the way a good DIPA looks. It's like a well proportioned, classic, beauty. Well we have a good looker here. The body was clear, and a couple of shades deeper than amber. The head was two fingers thick at first, but settled down a little smaller afterwards, and there was a steady stream of gentle carbonation. The aroma was prototypical DIPA, in the form of grapefruit, and was quite strong, as it hit me even at an arms length. The first sip indicated a hop bomb, as the bitterness was bracing and bold. There was a lot of citric tasting hop acids, and they were supported by a biscuit like malt backing. The finish was bready, and the hops lingered on. This was a well crafted DIPA, and should be taken as a textbook example of the style. Everything here was just as it should be."

"O: The beer has great promise in the looks and smell, but the taste was so bad I did not finish the bottle. I've read that Summit hops may be the cause of the onion-y flavors; if so I need to avoid beers that use Summit for flavoring."

"O: My second offering from Green Flash and so far they're 2-for-2 when it comes to delivering excellent beers. I noted before that this one was nearing its enjoy-by date, so I'm going to assume that it's not as fresh as it could have been, but that didn't hinder its enjoyability at all. It was still a hop bomb that provided everything I look for. I wasn't floored by it, but I enjoyed it more than the standard fare. Would really like to try this again, but a bit fresher."

"Not sure what to think. I enjoyed Palate Wrecker, West Coast IPA, and Green Bullet. I want to be fair but this beer actually disgusted me. It was the first time I have EVER picked up the infamous garlic/onion in any IPA, and I don't know why. Appears to be rather fresh (best by 7/27/14). Maybe too fresh??? Maybe some day I'll give it another shot, but for the price of a bomber I doubt it"

"It's nice to see more great quality beers available to me. I have been a huge Sierra Nevada drinker for years.Their quality has always been top notch. Recently I have discovered other small breweries that are making very high quality beer. I feel blessed to live in Northern California and have so many quality beers being made in the area. Sacramento has and will have many small/startup craft brewers around the area. Many of these places are open only a few days a week and the beers are not being bottled,just served on tap or growlers to go but the quality is still very good. Its great to see people working and enjoying beers like other people in the past did with wines."
"Enjoyed over the course of an evening, poured from the bottle into a pint glass. A light orange amber, just grading into bronze color with a large quantity of whitish foam on top. Nose is resplendent with leafy, floral, piney, and spicy hop aromatics, with some citrus and tropical notes apparent but more of a floral green spice up top. Palate is a yin-yang esque nigh-perfect integration of sweet and intensely bitter (or perhaps juxtaposition is a better word, as the flavors remain separate). Initially I get fresh orange juice and cotton candy, followed by a pulverizing blast of pine needles, quinine, black pepper, light onion/garlic and toasted crusts. There's the sweetness again, this time calling to mind orange creamsickle, tangerine and perhaps a little grapefruit, grape skins, peach. A lot of fruit flavors and there's gotta be hop varietals in here besides just Summit and Nugget, although there's more than enough green flavor and pungent spice to successfully ID these. Heavy duty stuff but has some of the flavor complexity of its little brother, West Coast IPA. The hops are aggressive but fail to overshadow the sweet malts, although I will say that the bitterness gathers steam and near the end I am getting that euphoric spicy numbing that I crave in this style. Pretty thick and syrupy yet smooth and drinkable (perhaps that's the endorphins talking). Fits the West Coast mould but maybe less tropical and more earthy/spicy than others. Haters gotta hate, but Green Flash has at least one diehard fan up here."

"O: May not have had a better IIPA. Green Flash has impressed me before; they only continue to impress."
"Purchased at Whole Foods pursuant to beer steward label stating, """beat Pliny in blind in-store taste test.""" A misrepresentation of sorts. A deep amber appearance. The scent is slightly off, as if the hops used were not very fresh. Great taste but a little flat. Acceptable mouth feel but lacking interesting spices or notes. An excellent imperial IPA, but not likely to purchase again."

"O- This a very good example of a west coast imperial IPA with a heavy dose of hops to enjoy. Green Flash did a fine job putting this brew together. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys this type of beer. Cheers."
""
"A lot of fantastic IPAs available here (I know, first world problems) and part of me wants to grade this higher. An outstanding IPA that I've been waiting to try. Love what Green Flash is doing!"

"O- a nice big flavored IIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste of a great IPA with a lot of hop character and nearly double the bang."
""
""
""
"Will have again; worth searching for if you are an IPA fan."
""
"Overall: This fits my personal definition of a west coast double IPA. Tongue-bruising bitterness throughout with not as strong of a malt/sweet backbone. Hits the spot for a hop bomb."
""
"O: Another winner from Green Flash. Not as hop-forward as Palate Wrecker or Green Bullet, but finishes a bit smoother. The 9.4% ABV is well-hidden behind the piney dryness."
""
""
""
""
"Right in line with the classic west coast IPA style. Not overly hoppy, citrusy or floral."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - I couldn't do it. Rarely do I pour out a beer, but considering the odd flavors imparted after such a promising start, even the benefit of the doubt couldn't save this Imperial."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a unique take on the style. I personally like Palate Wrecker and Green Bullet more than this. It has alot of similarities with Green Bullet. The craftsmanship is definitely there, just like with all Green Flash beers. This is good stuff, but nothing overly exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one to try. So hop forward, may be difficult to go back to."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - My first thought was that this could be Arctic Panzer if I were blindfolded, just add a bit of the fruitiness of Dreadnaught w/out the sweetness - the complexity and balance here are nearly perfect. At $5.49 a bomber I will pick this one up every time I see it. If you like your DIPA's on the dry bitter side, not sweet and nearly puckering, then this is a must try - two thumbs way up for me :)"

"Overall: A very good Imperial IPA. Not for the faint of heart as this is very bitter but a hop head should love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Beers like these make it hard for me to enjoy typical IPAs. I love the huge bitterness, and alcohol. Green Flash has been brewing some excellent beer and I'm real glad it makes it out to the east coast."
""
""
"O- Well above average beer, but not a show-stopper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the first brew from Greenflash that has disappointed me. I will put this on the """do not try again list"""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The dank hops (summit?) are really intense, especially in the flavor. I'd like more hop complexity. Very hop forward, even for an IIPA. A touch more malt balance would be appreciated. Unique example of the style."
""
"O - Green Flash have a very well crafted ale in Imperial India Pale Ale. It's brilliantly bitter and almost rough. But it warms the belly and gives our taste buds a real hop loaded ride to ibu city. This was a rare find for us here at home. One of the Green Flash brews that don't come around as often as a few of the others do, but when it does I will be grabbing a bottle. This thing sure is tasty."

"more aggressive than a PTE or Double Jack, but this beer is right there. top 3 west coast IIPA easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good and balanced Imperial IPA that stays true to the style. Really happy that there is a solid malt backbone to support the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A flavorful, balanced DIPA that is just a trifle too sickly sweet to be a top echelon example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For a DIPA, this is solid and extremely balanced. I love it so much that the replay system is not working in Atlanta. Patriots are soaring high in Atlanta and that includes a Mulligan too."
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.00: Very good Imperial IPA that is as big as you would think and also features an excellent balance of malt and hop. Not the best IPA on the planet, but it is certainly worthy of the appellation """outstanding.""" Be aware: this is an over-the-top beer alcohol wise, so cancel your helicopter flying school field test if you try to down one of these at lunch. Nonetheless, hop-heads should check this one out of they can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is heavy, yes, but well-balanced. The pine-tropical hops are dialed way up there, but this one remains easy to drink. The strong ABV isn't even too detectable here. A perfectly solid and standout IPA, well-worth a repeat purchase!"
"Atmosphere is really excellent. Frothy head, persistent blanket, and persistent lacing. Nose is piny with a nutty tone. Hoppy, with touches of sweetness and citrus. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Overall: not the best DIPA I ever had, but a nice one nontheless. i was hoping for more hops, but as it seems I tend to like Green Flash's Porter-Stous rather that their IPAs."

"Had been meaning to try this for some time now but my quest for a relatively fresh bottle had been unsuccessful. Alas, found some about 6 weeks old and for $5.99 a bomber, I figured it was worth a try, a good decision in the end. This was an interesting brew, pours a clean deep golden colour with a small head. The aroma is a little weird, lots going on with distinct pine and citrus notes, coupled with some bready and oniony notes. The summit hop really has a presence in this beer and the taste is initially dominated by this. However, as you work your way through, the flavours become more complex and some tropical fruit (pineapple and peach) come through, couple by plenty of pine and bitterness. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer extremely well balanced with a light malt backbone; not heavy/syrupy like some big DIPA's. Initially, I wasn't sure what to make of this, but by the time I finished, I was a convert. I could see why some might not be and from experience I have found summit-heavy beers to be not so appealing. Green Flash got this right though, it is extremely well balanced and the flavours actually work very harmoniously. It is one of these beers that keeps you interested from start to finish so very much worth a go. A love it or hate it kind of beer in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Taste starts with a creamy breadiness, then grapefruit and a bit of mint, with a resinous finish. Has a clean, dry, bready and resinous aftertaste. Has average body with above average carbonation for a DIPA."
""
""
"O - Very nice DIPA. Better exist, but for $5.99 for a 24 oz. bottle, a good alternative when Founder's Double Trouble or Bell's The Oracle are not available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel like I got an old bottle. Was looking for a date on the bottle, but didn't see one."
""
""
""
"O - I had this at the Amsterdam Ale house in NYC, only $6 for a pint. The best beer I had that day."
""
"O - 4.00 - A very good imperial IPA, nothing about this beer makes it bad, no dankness, no onion/garlic flavor just the citrusy good hops that you want to taste. It tastes a lot weaker compared to palate wrecker. It's definitely more of a toned down imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle into an imperial pint glass"
""
""
"Overall – Other than the slightly off nose, this was a very nice imperial IPA. It’s a bit on the sweeter side, but all comes together at the end of the taste to leave a satisfyingly pleasant taste on the tongue."
"O: this is an interesting imperial ipa. Very different than anything I've had. Will definitely get it again sometime."
""
""
""
"Okay, so I am more of a stout/porter guy. I bought this beer for my contribution to a beer tasting party to show some guys new to the craft beer scene how bitter beer can be. I didn't look up any reviews on this. I just saw IPA so I bought it expecting an overly bitter beer that only a few might enjoy. However, I was wrong. This beer was great. It was a great starter pale ale for me as well as for the others. I know some of the more experienced IPA/APA people who can gulp down Stone Ruination without making a face may think it too sweet. Instead, just think of this brew as a crossover beer for those of us unused to the bitter side of the beer world. The color was pretty with a frothy head. The smell was flowery hops and sweet fruitiness. The taste may not have been the hop bomb that most people expect, but it I know it was plenty for me. Whether this was the intention of Green Flash Brewing or not. They sure did change my mind on IPA s. For this reason I congratulate this beer for being an excellent crossover brew into the world of hops. Now excuse me, I have some exploring to do."

"O: Beer that’s almost too much for me – no, it IS too much for me. This tastes like Dreadnaught’s twin brother, and that just happens to be a beer I don’t think I’ll ever buy again; some beers are just too sweet for me to fully enjoy, and this is one of them. In all, though, the hops are well-represented (especially in the nose), and there’s a lot I like about this beer – if you like your DIPAs wrapped in a big, sweet package, drink up!"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy pale golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, honey, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus notes with light-moderate bread/honey malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, floral, grass, pine, honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bright citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, cracker, bread, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral hop flavors; with a moderate honey/bready malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA Style! Great balance and complexity of bright citrus/floral/pine hop flavors with moderate bread/honey malt balance; and very smooth to sip on for being over 9%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours and nice burnt orange color good head sticks to the glass in a ring. Not a lot on the nose some faint hops... pine citrus. Don't see a bottling date but I'm guessing this isn't super fresh. Taste is really nice hop bitterness, leaves a nice residue on the tongue. Easily drinkable no alcohol hotness despite the abv. Green Flash rarely disappoints and this is no exception really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent IIPA. Probably not as """quaffable""" as the label might suggest. But not pretty good all around."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a slightly above average DIPA but not the best by any means. While I did enjoy it, I won't rush out to try this again as I think there are many better alternatives. Green Flash's West Coast IPA is far better than this in my opinion."
"overall, it's okay. it looks good in the glass. smell is funky but interesting. taste is just too bitter-funk for me but I enjoy it. I gave it a 4 because I appreciate the originality. i'd buy it again...."
""
"This beer is fantastic! For an Imperial IPA, it drinks much lighter than 9.4%. This beer tastes citrusy, like biting into a fresh Lemon with a silky smooth soft yet bitter aftertaste. I picked this up on a recent trip to LA and will seek it out again."
""
""
"O - This is a well balanced Imperial sipper. Not the best in class but a good drink."
"Had a 22 ounce Bomber in a tulip glass. Color was a deep coppery gold. Minimal smell. The tte was good, but the hop's in the West Coast IPA was more present. While it was a good beer, the West Coast has better flavor and the Pallette Wrecker is by far the best of the bottled Green Flash."

"O: Really good beer, and really light and crisp for a IIPA, definitely recommend buying if you see it, would make an exceptional beer for summer time"
""
""
""
"And yet, despite this, the body is surprisingly light; not the chewy biscuit one would expect from such a hop bomb. While I could not drink more than one at a single sitting, I would most assuredly try. This is just another superb beer from “America’s finest City.”"

"pours with a very thick head- its a golden, buttery color. the smell is very hoppy, pine citrus. the taste is more bitter, and bold than citrus. this is a good solid ipa. i would like a little more citrus- but i am really reaching out on a limb here to find anything wrong with this beer. this is the third beer from green flash that i have had and theyve all been pretty good... this just makes want to try other beers from them."

"The initial taste left me somewhat disappointed. What I felt the most was a strong alcohol taste. I would not have objected to that if the hops balanced that off to make are better balanced beer."
"Overall - Great brew, unique, would strongly recommend. This brew reminds me somewhat of Dogfish Head 90-minute, but again it is unique so it has significant differences."
"poured into a stone nonic pint glass. 2-3 fingers worth of head, poured kinda aggresively. very hazy, probably alot of chill haze i drank it a little too cold at first and let it warm up. golen almost orange color. smells of resinous, earthy, mildy citric hops. all hops almost no malt to speak of. taste is all hops lots of piney notes very bitter, with resinous earthy hops. again hardly any malts. great double ipa and at 9.4 abv it wouldn't take long to get your buzz on and by the end of the third bomber you'd probably be bombed. great highly drinkable brew."
"O: Man, this thing bruises. Started off fairly ugly, but as the beer warmed and aerated, things began to smooth out. A bit one dimensional, this is nonetheless a fine DIPA for those that are inclined to enjoy their beers on the extra bitter side. In the land of DIPA's, this is a fairly average. Still a good beer, nonetheless."

"The combustible tan head of this golden orange brew tops out well above the rim but never spills over, unlike the floating oily, herbal hop aroma that gives way to some lime, orange and cotton candy sweetness. Citrusy and malty to the tongue with more smooth, oily hops at the back. Well-blended alcohol with just a bit of heat in the back. One of the most enjoyable and relaxed DIPA's I've ever tried."
"O: Good beer that I will enjoy again in the future."

"Poured from a bomber to a shaker (bottled on 1/14/13). Pours a pale, but rusty reddish color allowing a lot of light through. Topped with puffs of bright white head that falls to small islands in the beer with lots of thick lacing. Nose of sweet and thick hops like an orange or lemon rind. Taste follows suit with lots of citrusy hops that have a lot of strong bittering, very stereotypical of a good west coast IPA. Dry finish with a little alcohol burn, but not really demanding on the palate. Little bit of a spritz to it as well. Overall, this is a very good DIIPA, which I come to expect out of pretty much anything made in San Diego."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tall mug. Pours a light golden yellow with a nice thick head. Smells of pine and a bit of alcohol. Taste is mostly the same. Pine dominates this beer, with citrusy notes and a slightly sweet undertone. The alcohol is masked perfectly as well. This IPA is a 9.4 ABV but drinks like a session ale. Unbelievable flavor and character. Mouth is extremely smooth as well. So crisp and refreshing. Not too heavy and not too light. You can't call yourself a true hophead without trying this. You will fall in love from the very first sip."

"O- Not a bad beer, but I was expecting better. I would buy it again though."

"O: Not as hoppy as I was expecting for an Imperial, but still quite enjoyable. I enjoyed the taste of pine."

"IPA is not my favorite style to begin with, but some I enjoy much more than others. I would say this is a little better than most I've tried. I enjoy the aroma more than the taste, and I've smelled better. The bitterness is overpowering. I'm sure many hopheads would disagree. Overall, not a bad beer, but I wouldn't buy it again."

"I really don't know what else to say about this beer. I keep trying to come up with some downsides to it and I keep coming up short. The smell isn't as delicious as the actual taste of it, I guess? That's a valid complaint, right? Also, the appearance of it misleads you into thinking it is a normal beer as opposed to the alcoholic cornucopia it actually is, so that is definitely another valid complaint against it. It's also kinda pricy in BC, which kinda sucks if you get addicted to it, much like how it sucks when you have to pay for crack cocaine."

"O: A very disappointing beer from Green Flash. I'm a huge fan of their imperial stout, but this IIPA is a hoppy mess that misses the point entirely."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - hops, hops, and more hops - bit of a one trick pony"
""
"Pours light copper with big head. Heavy lacing. Aroma of strong grapefruit, huge juicy bitterness in the nose. very nice. Very floral and aromatic. Heavy hop bite that lingers. Taste is pinier than the smell, and dryer that expected, but still a beautiful combo of the fruit and massive dry pine bit. Big flavor that completely masks the alcohol rather well. Medium mouthfeel and pretty slick on the palate. Nice double."
""
""
"O - 3.5 - This beer is a slight dissappointment to me from what I was expecting. I wanted it to be great but the aroma and flavor fell short based on the comparisons it received to the other beers I love. Good beer. Just not great."
""
"this is a high alpha bomb. it pours a funny orange honey color, with a lacey snowy white head on top that leaves some menacing lacing as it drinks. the nose is really fruity hops, almost tropical, with a sweeter malt profile and a lot of booze. it tastes like hop oil, like concentrate or something. very very intense hop flavor, a lot of fruit comes through from the nose too, pineapple and orange at the very least. big bold hops is all i can really taste after a few sips. mouthfeel is okay, feels heavy, even for an imperial. good carbonation though, and pretty drinkable for a beer of this size. its like all green flash beers really, a total hop overload, at the expense of complexity or other character, but it somehow all comes together. i liked this a lot, and at only 5 bucks a bomber, itll find its way into my fridge again."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light orange in color, good clarity. Oily, clear lacing. Fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is citrusy...tangerine, orange, apricot. Mild sweetness. Taste is nicely bittered, grapefruit now enters the fruit salad. Mild sweetness and alcohol lightly on the back end. Very drinkable, considering the high abv. Very delicious, insane, great beer."
""
""
""
"Not something I would revisit."
""
""
""
"Will pour a five+ finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Grapefruit nose and flavor is grapefruit hops and almost enough malt to balance. Light bitter aftertaste. $7.59 for a 22oz bottle from Glen Beverage Glen, NH."
""
"This is a great 'San Diego IPA', very hoppy with a unique hop profile, less piney and grapefruit, more straight up bitterness and other flavors. Give this a try for sure."

"O: This beer has got so much substance to it. It puts so many flavors together and hits a home run. This puts almost every flavor an IPA can have together in one bottle. I've tried most of the Green Flash year round brews and have not been disappointed yet. They really have their beers dialed in. They put a big emphasis on West Coast style hoppiness and definitely deliver. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Went back and looked at the date. Turns out it was just over 3 months old. I guess that explains it. Lesson learned - don't trust IPAs that you order online unless the vendor is willing to tell you the bottle dating. I'll come back and re-score this after I can find a fresher bottle."
"O- Solid dipa! This beer really opens up too... Not bad at all for the style, but there are so many others I just can't get tired of. This is a great one to try though, very well balanced."
""
""
"Buy this beer, enjoy."
""
""
"Overall: To the guys at Green Flash all I can say is thank you. Rarely you meet such a quality brew. I drank this think it would be sub-par and sip after sip I wish I had more. Salud!"
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and not much aftertaste. A decent DIPA, but there are plenty which are better. Worth trying though, and may need to try again sometime."
""
""
"Overall: just right degree of bitterness in this well balanced DIPA. The booze arent as well hidden as I would like but still an excellent brew."
""
""
"One of the better offerings I've had from Green Flash. It's a very big, very bold beer, but I think what makes it stand out from the other Socal IPAS is the strong dank and fruitiness. I wish the bittering hops didn't take over so much, but It's still a really nice beer."
""
"Seek this out!"
"O: Another great tasting IPA from green flash, this brew was really good enjoyed it thoroughly."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall i really like this DiPA. If you're into hops, if you're a hophead, this is ripe."
""
""
"O - A solid imperial IPA with great aromas & a good taste. Nothing to really wow me though."
""
""
""
"Alcohol is not warming and mouth feel is creamy with lots of head. Quite a nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nicely crafted example of the classic West Coast style of IIPA that does a great job highlighting the most important aspects of an IIPA: the hops and resulting bitterness. Definitely worth a shot if you can get it within a couple months of the bottled-on date"
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy, bright golden color with an eggshell colored head. Head retention is about average. The competing vibrant aromas of pine, citrus, floral, and roasted grain with a little sting of alcohol in the nasal passages comprise the bouquet. Mouthfeel is soft, full, wet, smooth and is balanced with a slight carbonation scrub and hop burn at the end. Nearly no alcohol warmth, flavor, or booziness. Dominating flesh flavor, cannabis, and peat up front imparted by resinous hops with peppery spice. It finishes with a little more of a sweet citrus. I'm digging this one. And for under $5 for a bomber at Fresh & Easy, I'll be digging this one often."
""
"Overall this was good. I like IPAs, but this was almost overpowering."
"Overall this is not my cup of tea. Way too bitter to enjoy more than a few sips. No my style of an enjoyable DIPA."
""
""
""
"Overall (5/5): This is a perfect example of a Double/Imperial IPA. It retains the dryness and medium-low sweetness of a regular IPA while reaching a beautifully in-your-face amount of bitter, fruity hop character only possible in a DIPA, and without becoming syrupy sweet or overly resinous and cloying. Just an amazing beer I wish I could find more often. Highly, highly recommended to lovers of the hop."
""
"Overall: This beer has a nice complexity and mouth-feel to it, and the pine flavor is distinctive. But while there was some malty sweetness to balance the pine and hops, I found the finish really bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours clear golden amber with a big white head and plenty of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving some lacing behind on the glass. A small cap of head is left behind atop the beer. I pick up aromas of citrus hops with that typical West Coast smell of orange and grapefruit. There is some sweet malt in the background. I can pick up some of the pine aroma as well. The citrus hops are more forward here, followed by some piney bitterness. The grapefruit and orange flavors are juicy. The sweet malts provide a nice backbone. There is a piney aftertaste, leaving some lingering bitterness in the mouth. Even at 9.4% ABV, the alcohol is not very noticeable. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is an excellent DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A very enjoyable Imperial IPA.  Big pine, herbal flavors balanced nicely with a solid malt backbone.  Well balanced and easy drinking for a 9.4 ABV beer.  Well done."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the variety of hops. These were great, but they just got lost amongst that madness that is the rest of this beer. The aroma is so strange, with sweat, dirt, and plastics as the primary trifecta. This carries over to the mouth too, where those components present the same problem. It would have been nice to have the sweetness appear a bit sooner, to better balance the bitters, rather than having a strong one-two knockout with two separately intense flavors."
""
""
"O: Probably one of the top 10 most bitter beers I've ever had. A west coast style IPA all the way, and exactly what I expected from Green Flash. Basically their West Coast IPA amped up."
""
""
"This is medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Very delicious."
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a blast of dry, tongue coating hop bitterness that's countered by some faint tropical fruit, pale malt and strong alcohol flavor. Hits of pine needle, pineapple and grapefruit are quickly countered by bread, biscuit and boozy heat. The high abv isn't very well masked and it takes away too much of the hop flavor for my liking. Still, a really solid interpretation of the style. Just a bit too boozy for me."

"Overall - My favorite IIPA. I prefer it over Double Trouble - which is a great beer. Green Flash has great beers"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Top notch stuff. Pop the bottle and chase that smell. I've been hooked on this stuff for along time now (years).... the only substitutes i like are maybe Ithaca flower power, troegs nugget nectar, or a good hoppy barleywine ---- all else has been a let down. Even if it's not your favorite i would challenge you to find a 9.5 abv as discreet as this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Certainly a different take on the West Coast IPA / Imperial IPA. Rather than big citrus/grapefruit hops, the hop presence comes through in the form of pine and spice. Would like the malt character to show through more."

"Served on tap at Local Option. The appearance is slightly hazy with generous 2 finger head and tons of lacing. The aroma is in your face with tons of piney hops, this enters the territory of spice... Some spruce like character as well a pine sap. Extremely pungent. The taste matches the over the top hop aroma with a huge bitter flavor. Starts slightly sweet with some apricot, this is followed by raw pine and a touch of earthiness. The mouth feel is medium with high carbonation. Overall, this is one of the hoppiest beers I've experienced. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cooper and clear, nice head good retention and great lacing. Smell is citrus. taste is good, the hops are pleasant not overwhelming. The body is where this beer is great, the malt is sticky and thick. Nice body. Overall, at 9.4% abv this beer hides the alcohol, delivers on taste and satisfaction."
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a tall frosty white foam that reduced to a soapy cap that left a ladder of sticky lacings from the top of the glass to the bottom. Pungent floral and citrus hop aromas with an underlying sweet maltiness. Medium bodied with a resinous feel from the start through the middle turning oily at the finish Pungent hop smack right up front that slowly tapers from beginning to end. Finishes with a delayed semi-dry pungent, piney, bitter hop aftertaste. Pungent hop aromas and flavors on display with this DIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"o: this is absolutely one of my favorite, likely top three, imperial IPAs"
""
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass, like all green flash, I have no idea how fresh this is. This is a golden color with a large tight bubbled slightly off white color with good retention and leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of hops, pine, and grapefruit, a little caramel and some alcohol. The feel is medium with a mouth coating resin. The taste is pretty good super high hops with a little caramel backbone. Pretty good, although this is the third one I've bought and the first which is good and fresh."
""
"O. Good DIPA. Has most of the qualities that I like in a DIPA. Has a nice marmalade flavor."
"The taste is the same as the nose, not overbearing, but pleasant. A little more mild than I had expected, but it certainly does not have the mouth full of pennies effect that some DIPAs have. A really nicely balanced beer ... crazy to say when talking Imperial styles A really nice mouthfeel and it is almost impossible to tell that it is 9.5% ABV ... maybe that will be easier to tell once I've finished the bottle. Decent beer, glad I finally had the chance to try it out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer at 9.40% ABV I really didn't smell or taste the alcohol which is one thing I like about beer. The lack of an outward presence of alcohol in aroma and taste and more complexity with the combinations of hops, malts, and yeasts."
""
"O - very good offering from Green Flash. Definitely will seek this out again."
"An incredibly drinkable IPA, but getting through 22oz of it can be a bit daunting. Still very delicious with enough flavors and aromas nicely laid out, but they weren't fighting for any kind of dominance."
""
""
""
"O: This is very disappointing. I love the Green Flash West Coast IPA and Palate Wrecker, so I had high expectations for this one. But the hops here are kind of unpleasant, and are dominated by a strange, sickly garlic/onion/vegetal character that leaves a nasty aftertaste behind."
""
""
""
""
"O - A great beer by green flash. One of my. Common complaints about DIPAs is that they are too sweet or overly hoppy. This is one that combines those two flavors together to give you a well balanced and flavorful beer."
""
"O: Way too intense to be an easy drinking beer or sessionable, this is much more of a sipping beer for the evening. The flavors and aroma of this beer are really quite enjoyable and definitely a beer that I really enjoyed, would get again."
""
""
"O – Love it. Great brewery. Loving their policy of refridgeration all the way to Australia. This one is big, bold and just an enamel stripping hop bomb."

"Mouthfeel is excellent- medium light body with moderate carbonation. Great DIPA- great hop flavors; get it if available."

"Overall, this is a fine beer, but it's not about to usurp 90 Min or Pliny..."
"A: I enjoyed this beer and would definately drink again but not overly sessionable, more of a sit down and enjoy a bottle with a meal. Easy drinking for imperial."
"O- This is a good beer. I have had better for the style but I can definitely see myself giving this one another go. However, I'm very disappointed that there is no bottle date on Green Flash beers, especially if I'm going to dole out $7-10 for one of their IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hop heads rejoice. Definitely bitter but doesn't go too overboard."
""
""
""
"I wasn't impressed with the oxidation and lack of date coding, especially considering this is Green Flash's first foray into Maine. And I'm not too impressed with the flavor of this DIPA. I'm generally not into the green onion/garlic chicken/"""pungent""" hops in IPAs, and in the end, this Green Flash offering sits no differently on my palate. Booo."
"This is a good IPA, but I would like a bit more bitterness. The sweet herbyness is a bit much for me. Solid, but nothing to write home about."
""
"O: Extremely well balanced DIPA. Very nice."
""
"O-a pretty good IPA, but once again this is a case in which I think the brewery's lower IPA (Green Flash West Coast IPA) is a lot better. i enjoyed this, but it took the citrus aspect to a new level, to the point where it tasted more like an orange beer than an IPA. i did enjoy it and would recommend hop heads to at least try this."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Really nice foamy rings mark the drinking progress all the way down the glass. Smell is of huge citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical aromas. Taste is very much the same with some dank hop flavors and a medium bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA but I think the smell is better than the taste."
""
"O - Delicious. That word sums it up! Well balanced. Exactly what I want when I want a west coast DIPA. A hop heads dream!"
""
"Overall, kerrpies, I need a cheese plate here with this. A real great looking brew that just screams food pairing, mixing a non boozy hop rush and balanced earth boquet that screams winning. Nice job."
"Overall – This is an excellent beer, probably one of the better DIPA’s I’ve ever had. Smooth, strong, no hint of the high ABV, I literally smelled this beer before I even poured it! Now that’s intense. I would recommend this to anyone who likes IPA, you can’t even tell it’s an Imperial until you try to concentrate after a few pints and find it difficult. Highly recommended! Need a good Imperial IPA? Go with this one. Problem solved, problem staying solved, Rangers lead the way."
""
"22 oz bomber poured in a duvel tulip. Pours a clear orange yellow with a 2 finger white head that foams and slowly recedes. Tropical aromas. Pineapple, and apricot with light pine scent. The flavor is more tropical fruit. Fresh citrus, pineapple, and mango are here with a creamy malt and some dank flavors. This beer is nicely balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. Medium thin mouthfeel that lingers a bit. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Wow. I'm a fan of the traditional hop-bomb but this was almost too much for me. Almost. Correct me if you must but the strong bold awesome hoppy flavour I got when drinking this was a very strong pine like taste. Not bad per we but it doesn't agree with me the same as the flavours of some of my favoure imperial/double ipas out there. Still, a very tasty but dry and bitter ipa I can enjoy, with a lingering aftertaste you will enjoy if you're into that sort of thing."
""
"It poured a hazy deepish orange color with a one finger head. The smell was purely west coast IPA, Massive amounts of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. A good astringency from the hops came through in both taste and smell. Tasted like a grapefruit and a mango got together. The feel of this beer is almost kind of pulpy, It has a rich feel and I feel like tiny little hop particles were filling my mouth. It goes down rather smooth and I cant taste the 9.4% alcohol but I could feel it a little. Overall, this is a classic well done example of a west coast Imperial IPA and what it should be."
"Medium- full body, lighter than expected effervescence. Slight coating of the upper palate with a hint,of drying. ABV is well hidden in this smooth IPA."
""
"Appearance is nice, well foamed and plenty of spritz in the mouth. But it cuts right to the tongue. Only thing I can say on the plus side is the hops are extremely floral and not at all bad as aromatics, but they are overwhelmed by the dank grapefruit peel. I tried flavoring a couple of less hoppy beers, but the Green Flash took over like a bad dog."
"Enjoy!"

"Update: Tried on draft from a growler, and it was far more bitter and less fruity. Preferred bottled."
"Full amber with reddish tone. Clear with a slight haze. Two fingers of cream color head . Good amount of lacing. Aroma is all floral, fruity hops. A bit of slightly too ripe pineapple. Taste is bitter resinous oily hops. Again the grapefruit aspect is slightly over ripe. Might be from the high abv. Good amount of malts but not enough for my liking. Mouthfeel is quite good with just barely enough carbonation. Alcohol is actually well hidden so watch out. Nice bitter medium dry grapefruit finish. No freshness date that I could find. Would like to try it on tap sometime. I down rated the drinkability a touch due to the 9.4% abv. Not a session beer unless you are a very large person. I am more than halfway through this bomber and it still has a cap of head after a good ten minutes. It would be much better with an abv of about 7.5% IMO. A virtual Barleywine except for the mouthfeel."
"This was far to intrusive to me."
""
""
""
""
"O – Just a great brew here with plenty of hop punch but really interesting flavors to go along. Warming alcohol but honestly does not feel like a 9%. I wish they sent this east. Will try more on my next trip west."
""
"It's a goodness you very quickly can feel, like shots of booze. It's good cold, like the style should be and even beter as it warms. This is definitely a bomber to consider again and again. Top of the line!"
"Easily one of my favorite DIPAs and certainly the best I've had in probably about 3 months. Enough juiciness and bright hop flavors to strike a solid balance with the massive bitterness. And that heavenly aroma... sigh..."
""
"DOA"
""
"I think I would also prefer if there were some more traditional fruity hops just to keep the attention. Works very well as a unique beer though."
""
""
""
""
"Looks like a great imperial IPA, a slightly hazy orange-amber color with a large head. The aroma is very, very hoppy. Citrus, pine, grapefruit, and the like. A small amount of malts back it up. The taste is very hoppy, without being very bitter or very sweet. One of the most """balanced""" DIPAs I've had, and I'm not using the term balanced as a euphemism for sweet like some people tend to. It'll hit you with the hops all night long, but it'll still call you back in the morning. The mouthfeel is a little undercarbed for my taste, but otherwise full and coating, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a very good double IPA that just falls short of the top tier. It's surely a very good beer though."
""
""
""
"O - Very very good, different than other west coast double's but in a good way. A definite go to if I find it on tap or in a bomber."
""
"O - Overall this was a great beer. Besides the fact the citrus was lacking in taste, and there wasn't that bitterness I was looking for, it was a really good beer. Nice refreshing taste, with a nice aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With the first taste there are a strong amount of hops, but they are balanced with a subtle malt background. For all of the amazing hop flavor it is a surprisingly easy beer to drink with a very low bitter aftertaste. One of my new favorites from Green Flash."
"O - A great beer! I'm glad I finally got to try this one! Highly recommended! A great price point too..."
""
"Overall a very nice Imperial IPA. I would buy it again, because its very drinkable with well integrated alcohol."
""
""
""
"A much more full and balanced than I expected. This is not just a blatant explosion of hops but one that takes into account alcohol and balance as well and meshes them well. Solid, fits the mold as a DIPA to be reckoned with."

"I grabbed this bottle as I noticed it was newly available at the store. No date on the bottle but based on my previous statement I'm assuming it's very fresh. Pours a glorious copper/gold color with a thick foamy head. There's much lacing on the glass as each sip is taken. Well-carbonated. Stunning appearance! Aroma - wow! Very strong and bright grapefruit and citrus - juicy and fresh! A hint of pine in there as well. I can't do the nose justice enough - it's really bursting out of the glass like none other! The taste is magnificent as well - very bitter, just the way an Imperial IPA should be. Has a taste that can be described perfectly as cannabis! Earthy & resiny. The initial smacking of flavor on the palate still is the sweet citrus however, and it warms nicely going down. No malts detected whatsoever. It fully coats the mouth, like velvet, with a nice crisp finish. One cannot tell that this beer is over 9% by any means, so watch out! I finished the bomber myself and of course I have a bit of a dried out feeling afterward but that is to be expected. One of the best beer drinking experiences I've had in a while."

"O - A real nice DIPA without the wow factor"

"It's with great appreciation that this Imperial IPA doesn't attempt to balance the hops with an equal rise of malt, rather remaining true to American IPAs where the hops dominate without malt interferrence. This allows the beer to deliver a high level of drinkability despite its alcohol content. But a stronger and more delicate potpouri of hops particularly in the nose could really rocket this beer to the likes of Dreadnaught and Hopslam."

"green flash imperial ipa... thats were it all started for me.... a local grocer (kobackers) had this in stock a few years back and i had opted for something new that day... well what a suprise... no generic beer ever tasted the same after that day.... this is truly one of the best ipas you will ever encounter..."
"This is a great I.I.P.A. I am surprised at the color, it's much more pale that I am used to for the style. It doesn't matter, this here beer is 9.4%abv and it is hidden well by a strong hop assault on the tongue immediately upon entry of the mouth. Wonderful bready malts show themselves after said assault. I am a huge fan of this beer. The price is right, at Beertopia they were selling it for 5.49 a bomber. Fan-f*ckn-tastic. I wanted a new dipa to try as I am such a fiend I've exhausted the limited selection we can find here. I would love to trade this with someone for other dipas I can't find here. I have a dipa problem."

"O: Wow, blows my mind. This is a hop bomb of epic proportions. The smell and taste are killer and complex for their seemingly one dimensional nature. A must try! So hoptastic!"
""
""
""
""
"overall its a pretty solid ipa"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most interesting smelling beers I have ever encountered, a lot going on in this one. One of my favorite DIPAs even if it isn't exactly the most representative of the style. If it was a tad less bitter in the finish then it would be about perfect. Known as """weed beer""" amongst my friends."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The balance makes this a nice beer. I expected and hoped for a hop bomb because it's Green Flash but I presume this beer was sitting for a while based on the place of purchase and therefore had time to mellow out. Drink this!"
""
""
"O - I hope this bottle is over the hill and not demonstrative of the brew."
""
""
"Definitely drinkable on any day, but I'd like to think of it as one of those brews on the brink of stardom, but just barely missed the mark."
""
"I found the grassy flavor to be far to overpowering. Even letting the beer warm didn’t change the strong grassy taste. It’s not a flavor I hate, but I would prefer it to be balanced better. I love Green Flash Brewing, and their West Coast IPA is among my favorites. However I didn’t like the Imperial version and won’t buy it again."
""
""
"Fresh or not, I'd try this again in a heartbeat. The more a drank, the more I wanted! It compares pretty favoribly with Hoppin Frog Hop Dam & Founders Devil Dancer- the two """dankest""" Imperial (or triple, as they'd tell you) IPAs I've had. Great job makimg it easy for me to down a 9.4% abv bomber on my own without tasting the alcohol!"
""
"Green Flash Imperial IPA has everything that a big IPA or IIPA should have, and it drinks very well for its ABV. The hops profile, however, isn't my thing. With that said, this is a well-made beer that I don't like, but I could how see others would."
""
"O: Because of the rancid onion taste I have to rate this low. It was just purely aweful. I couldnt finish my 5oz. However, after reading some other reviews, looks like Ill have to try this in bottle, as it seems quite tasty how others describe it. IDK, maybe it was a bad keg or there was something in the lines."
"did i say it was sticky? i think it might have been undercarbonated, which might explain the dull aroma but probably not the missing malt flavors (if anything, increased carbonation would enhance hop perception)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: This is bad. Summit+Nugget hops = epic disaster. I'm not sure what happened but the recipe formulation is terrible. Avoid."
""
"O - very enjoyable brew, I really liked how the maltiness balanced out the bitterness to give a strong but enjoyable beer. would recommend this."
""
"Overall: This is a nice DIPA. There is a good balance of hops and malt. I would have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall... Not bad. It is a good beer, but not mind-blowing in any aspect."
""
""
"This brew poured out as a clear looking copper color with a thick white head on top. The lacing sticks really well to the glass with clumps of retention on top of the beer. The smell if loaded with west coast hop aromas. The taste is also loaded with the citrusy bitter bite of all the hops used in this brew. The Mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied, good carbonation to it and a little bit oily. Overall the beer is a powerhouse of an IPA, it's enjoyable if you like the style. I would drink it again for sure."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, pale, honeygold-yellow coloring with a thin film of white, frothy head. Aromas of citrus and berries, both sweet and robust, with a heavy backbone of resiny, wet, rich hops. Flavors are hop forward, and they bring the thunder. Very rich, mouth filling hops profile, peppery and resiny, with a heavy oregano and grass character, as well. The citrus shines through as a very tart and crisp grapefruit highlight, and it helps to cut the richness of the hops. A light caramel malt flavor balances everything out. The aftertaste is more of the hops spicing, with a tart and bitter citrus effect, and the slightest hint of marijuana. The beer clings all over the glass while you drink, and the finish is slick, and slightly lingering. Great representation of the style, and it definitely represents the West Coast. Delicious!"
"Overall - I'm a big fan of GF's IPA, and this one tastes very close. It's got a sweeter flavour but it's missing a big hop profile. I wish that GF would use a bottle dating system. Still, this is a fantastic west coast DIPA that I would have no issue buying again."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer. I only wish they would put a bottling date on the label, which is why I can't give this a 5/5."
"O- I am diggin' this, not too bad for a bomber @ under $7. Too bad there's no label date- I won't buy this unless I know it's a new arrival."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow! Just what I have been looking for, this beer is like hop-overload! Can it get any better for a hop-head? I think not. Pours a murky golden color, with a lasting head that laces the entire glass. This beer is fantastic, it's just a shame it can't be had in 6 packs! Still a fantastic beer for a bomber especially considering the price!"
""
"I don't know. I wouldn't call it the best I've had. Still, a hophead can't go wrong with this."
""

"Notes: Kicking up a notch, well maybe a couple of notches, their West Coast IPA but not incredible so, given how hoppy that one was. Here the malt and booze linger a bit longer with a sturdier hop sense… But I dunno If I´d probably stick to their IPA and pick up a different DIPA if given the chance… Nice brew in any case."

"One finger soapy, frothy white head over clear deep gold body, multitude of streams of rising bubbles. Nose is citrus, grapefruit, some meyer lemon, pine as it warmed, not much malt aromas, subsumed by hops. Taste mirrors nose, some light caramel notes, resiny on the backend, got more bitter as it fully warmed. Mouthfeel is just on the full side of medium, creamy smooth, decent effervescence. Nice, but a bit boozy, certainly within parameters of SD IPA style, makes me wish I had a Poor Man's for comparison. Worth a try for hopheads, recommended."
""
"Nice to come back to his after a while. Poured into a tulip glass the beer leaves a nice fluffy two finger cap that lingers as I drink leaving some serious lacing. The nose is all dank sweet crushed hops, nice forest pine and grapefruit emanate from my glass.the flavor profile is reminiscent of the nose, in your face hops, sweet grapefruit and a note of mango and tangerine fill out the offering all balanced with just the right touch of sweet maltiness. This classic west coast DIPA is just so reliable that I take it for granted some times. Available everywhere and priced at about six dollars a bomber make it even more enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really nice beer, I would definitely recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
"This is an unoffensive, complex, smooth, enjoyable IPA."
""
""
"Still a solid beer and better than other IPA offerings I've had from Green Flash in the past. There's just a touch too much sweetness and not enough hop flavor for my taste."
"O: Not my favorite. There is something in this one I just don't like. Maybe it's just my bottle as there are several very favorable reviews. Just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Sharp and acidic, that lingers for a long time in your mouth."
""
"o - Overall a very good DIPA. Nose is great and chock full of fresh hops and fruits. Taste is a little bitter and more malts come out, but it's a very good beer. Something I'd certainbly have again."
""
""
"Hopefully my opinion will change when I get the chance to taste this ale from a bottle."
"Damn good DIPA. Hop Heads Rejoice"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I love Green Flashes regular IPA and this is just as great only bigger. 5/5"
"Update 2/19/2012: Drinking another bottle of this and this one must be a bit fresher. The hops are really fresh and pungent. Outstanding"
""
"First American-brewed double IPA I've had in long while after several months in Japan, and man does it taste good. Perhaps the freshest Green Flash I've had. Buying Green Flash in the Midwest was a crap shoot, since the lack of bottle dating sometimes resulted in the purchase of beer with spectacularly faded hops. My impression is that shipments to Tokyo are probably smaller and sell more quickly, perhaps ensuring better freshness. Cheers to the folks at Nagano Trading for importing this and an ever-increasing variety of US craft beers to Japan."

"Green Flash Imperial IPA came in a glass, the color was very bright golden wth some faint traces of orange. Much lighter than most DIPA's I've come across. A nice sturdy white head up top leaving minor stick. Smell is light grapefruit with a small amount of bubblegum and sweet malt scent. There is cabbage and dead veggie smell, sulfur, nasty musk after some warming. Taste wise GF Impy has grapefruit with minor amounts of other tropics, small pine, and a nice pale malt backing. This takes a complete 180 in the middle turning to sulfur, plastic, throwup and just plain nastiness. Hard to put down and harder to describe. Feel, GFIIPA goes down like a single and does not have the extra sweetness I find in alot of doubles. Carb is fine. This was not a good look but Im going to try it again off the tap and out the bottle just to make sure."
"Cracked open a decidedly fresh bottle to see what the fuss was about (trust me, I've encountered some mild fuss out here...). It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of very lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises pine resin, light cilantro, lemon zest, light orange rind, light grapefruit peel, light biscuit, and grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine resin and cilantro really taking control of the situation, ensuring my tongue understands that hops are now in charge. Indeed. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice, very hoppy DIPA. Straight up."
"Overall it's not especially balanced and is a bit hard to drink. Overwhelming would be a good way to describe it. A hop fanatic's dream."
"I will definitely drink again as it is in my wheel house of flavors."
"Drinks smoothly and is another excellent hopped beer from green flash. Not perfect but always interesting and worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall it's a very good beer and an excellent version of the style. The hoppiness was great, at times it felt a little big and boozy but that isn't that surprising given the abv of it. Very enjoyable beer to sip on during football this afternoon."
"Kudos to Green Flash for a job well done."
"O - This is a good quaffable Imperial IPA."
"Poured from a bomber Into a pint glass. Pours a clean, brilliant gold that's largely transparent. Head is thin and scarcely leaves any lacing behind in it's wake. The nose is loads with hops and grapefruit. Plenty of citrus here. Taste is heavy on the grapefruit and bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily. Very thick, coats your mouth and hangs around with a good deal of bitterness. Pretty decent IPA overall."
"The taste is very bitter on the front and grows intensity as you swallow but a very sweet tropical flavor makes an appearance before the bitterness and some alcohol comes in on the back. Very pleasant."
"O: Not extremely balanced (not enough malt or sweetness to balance off the bitter hops,) but still quite enjoyable. If it was a tad malty, it'd be absolutely top notch and one of, if not THE, best DIPAs...but I guess west coast IPAs aren't into all that jazz. This is a great example, however, of a type of beer that really symbolizes the west coast. Drinking this makes me feel like I'm in the warm California weather."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a bright orange amber, with a big 2 inch head that lingers. Nice lacing, but more mild then I remember. Smell is orange, pine, and dank weed. Taste is all that with some grapefruit and booze in the finish. Nice full body, with plenty of carbonation. Very approachable for the high ABV. This is the first time I drank this knowing the date bottled on 9/13/11, thx to Case n Keg letting me go out back to check. Fresh this is one of the best DIPA out."
"I have not been enjoying big ipas of late, probably for a year or two. But I think this one has brought me back. Big beautiful soapy creamy white head which is lasting very nicely, and leaving some great lacing. The beer is bright orange tangerine with a bit of haze that could very well be chill induced. Wonderful grapefruity citrus nose with a reassuring hint of grainish malt. Bitter, but not just straight up bitter...bitter with flavor of grapefruit, or orange rind...bitter with a backbone of flavor. Bitter but in balance with a sweetness that brings harmony. I am really enjoying this. Each sip encourages another...slick, smooth, nice rich body without being overwhelming. Also, this beer is dangerous, 9.4% is hidden. I will buy it again."
"this is perfectly balanced. the alcohol is disguised, the aromas and flavors are very bright without being over the top. I like it a lot. I will definately buy again."
"I don’t get the high ratings for this beer. I thought it was just average, especially compared to other double IPA’s. Maybe I got a bad pour, but I don’t think so. I won’t be trying this again."
"smell but it is good. nice grapefruit hop taste. maybe a little to bitter on the finish. definitely has cascade hops which I like. overall a really good ipa but not one of my favorites. it really tastes alot like stone ruination just not as smooth."
"Kind of just sits there in your mouth. the hops really pervade the aftertaste with the slick malt coating your mouth."
"I thought the mouthfeel was pretty good; med. carbonation, slightly sticky, finish not overly long. This is definitely a hophead only beer and even then, ya gotta love that onions and garlic thing to really enjoy this one. Glad I tried it, unlikely to be going back."
"O: 4"
"This is one big-ass beer. I'm on a hop kick again. I go in cycles. This is right in my wheelhouse right now. Eventually I;ll shift back to big bodied malty, spicy, belgians but right now, this is something I'm going to drink until the kegs around town kick."
"O- Solid beer I’ve had better and I had a lot worse, the next time I see it on a menu it stands a good chance of being ordered. The 9.4% ABV is well hidden, I would not have thought that it was this high."
"O- This is a good unique bitter IIPA and the 9% ABV is very well hidden. This is very easy to drink and at a good price, definitely will be getting more."
"Edit from 11/4/11. This beer seems to now be fairly available on tap here in Baltimore (knock on wood), and so I've been able to have it a few times. Maybe my sense of smell was off when I first had it, because the last few times, I've been hugely impressed by the dank earth, dry citrus and pine I pick up on the nose. Just an all around incredible, unusally outstanding DIPA... this is an incredible addition to the beer scene here in Bawlmore."
"O: I'm not a huge fan of Green Flash, but wow, this really impressed me. Tons of hop flavor with some malt presence without the overwhelming bitterness that I've come to expect from them."
"O - This i a very good very good Imperial IPA. Love the tropical fruit flavors and grapefruit."
"o: Not in the top tier of DIPAs I've had but a solid effort nonetheless. Very drinkable as alcohol is not readily prevalent. Definitely worth trying for DIPA fans especially at the price."
"Medium, oily mouthfeel, very typical of a DIPA. Limited notice of the alcohol overall. Solid offering."
"O: A very nice, west-coast stylized DIPA that's a hop onslaught without being a burning, bitter hot mess. The 9.4% ABV is there, but so is a plethora of juicy malts and musty hop notes to chew on. Attention to detail and controlled chaos has me thinking Green Flash is the best of Sierra Nevada and Stone combined; a hop-centric's sleeper DIPA."
"Had this on tap and then just the bottle to compare the two. I would have to say the bottle is a little better over all. Big hop aroma and flavor. A little bit of a hop bomb on the pallet by over all this has a nice big hit with the great taste of a truly developed IIPA. Good work!"
"M- Just enough carbonation, nice feel."
"What sets this IPA apart for me is the delicate nuances of the hop flavors. Many IPAs seem to want to blast the tongue with as much sourness as it can handle, but while this Imperial IPA is indeed bitter, it also contains many fascinating flavors that my tongue wanted to roll over for quite a while. Take note: this is still not a beer for those who don't like hops. But if you do, this one is worth a try."
"O-Good but not great,in my opinion."
"Bright, potent, but more herbal than fruity/tropical, setting it apart from it's peers (especially in SoCal)."
"Overall - Granted, I love this style and am a hophead so I give it high marks. It's not my favorite DIPA, but it's up there. I would highly recommend it."
"OVERALL: My notes say """Good, not great, but good.""" I will drink this beer again, but it will not be my go too. I would say if this one wasn't tougher for me to track down I'd almost always take a Hop Stoopid over it, but it is a good change of pace and ultimately I did enjoy it."
"O: This beer is a real hop bomb, but despite the high amount of bitterness it isn’t too difficult to drink. Although the alcohol is well masked from the taste, so are the malts, which makes it seem to be a bit one dimensional."
"I enjoyed this beer, and would definitely seek it out again. I'm trying a few West Coast IPAs in preparation to a trip to California in October. Wish me well!"
"O - Overall I enjoyed this cask, Poured at the taproom SD 8/3/11"
"O: Despite the 101 I.B.U.'s I found this Imperial IPA to be quite drinkable. This is because the alcohol is well hidden and there is a manageable level of piney hops that are used."
"O- Overall, I found this caught me by surprise, and I wasn't expecting it to be as much of a superb example of the style as it was. It also has an incredible price point too, considering the quality. I wouldn't pass this one up."
"Aroma has grapefruit citrus and some tropical fruit touch of pineapple as well as some malt biscuit sweetness and some alcohol in the nose. Flavor is raw west coast hop character with leafy, citrus grapefruit hop flavor. Drinkability is a solid west coast DIPA. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try another San Diego style DIPA."
"Overall this beer is one to shy away from if you're new to aggressively hoppy beers, but for those hopheads I referred to in the beginning - this is definitely worth a go."
"Notes: A very well-balanced, full-bodied brew. A bit more body than I expected from this brew. The alcohol is well hidden, which makes the beer very easy to drink. A solid effort, and one that I will seek out again."
"Opinion: This actually turned out to be a pretty good beer. It is stupidly hoppy, but that is what you can expect from certain examples of this style. It still manages to give a bit of balance and the complexity of the hops help it to keep from seeming one-dimensional. It has about 1 1/2 dimensions, but it still has something. If you are a hop-head, I would definitely recommend this beer. If you are a malt-head like I am, I would still recommend it, but maybe you might want to split a bomber with a friend...or two."
"Drink- I need to drink more of Green Flashes beers. I always over look them being from So.Cal. This was a nice beer. I would like to have again just in a bigger glass."
"hoping for a brisk complexity and the hop note was great. lots of grapefruit and a solid malty sweet back. the bitter end was wood pine with a bit of a resin to it. well balanced. on tap it gave me more grassiness. some green pepper... almost a different beer. a whole lot of Amarillo though. totally solid... but safe. i think the IPA has more accent. still a good beer though."
"Overall - A slight disappointment. It's strange that I thought Green Flash West Coast IPA didn't have enough malt to it and this one has way too much. I'd bet a 2 part West Coast IPA and 1 part Imperial IPA combination would be spectacular."
"My only problem with this beer is it could use a little bit more mouth feel but it is a great beer over all. Definitely a classic west coast ipa. Smell of citrus hops and nice finish of nugget hops. Finishes very dry and leaves you wanting another sip so it is very drinkable."
"It's brash and in-your-face, but seems a little too big for its boots. There's not enough dimension in the hop character to hold your interest and justify the overt booziness. Much prefer the West Coast personally."
"Overall, this is a man's Imperial IPA. Big, bold, dank, and it leaves a lasting impression. I like this beer a lot."
"Overall it was solid, but not outstanding. Being that they're among the kings of the west coast style IPA I thought this would be a more intense IPA experience, but it was fundamentally different than I had expected with more maltiness (yes, required for the alcohol, but still) and less complexity of the hops profile."
"Overall I thought this was a very hoppy, crisp and delicious IIPA. I didnt think that it had any depth or complexity to it but it was a major hop bomb and a good one at that. I would definitely seek another out in the future"
"O - Definitely above average, solid flavors and smell. I'll pick one up anytime I see it."
"O: Seems to be a bit of a polarizing DIPA. I liked it for something a bit off the beaten path, but I'm not sure I'd drink this on a regular basis?"
"22oz bottle. Pours a very hazy amber color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Nice nose of hops. Mostly citrus with some sweet pine. Somewhat tropical. Taste is dry and hoppy. A lot more pine taste than pine aroma. Not much citrus, in fact it is a bit floral towards the end. Creamy mouthfeel as well as being dry. Nice amount of bitterness. Very little alcohol burn. Nicely drinakble for an Imperial. Overall, its a solid Imperial IPA and a good price at that. Worth getting."
"Suf*ckingperb."
"Overall I don't remember this one when it was fresh, but I really love this as a three year old. Highly recommended at any age."
"I continue to struggle to find a Green Flash beer that I truly enjoy. They all seem to clash with me a bit or otherwise miss the mark. Now that they're moving in just down the street from me, I'm hoping I'll be able to find one that suits my fancy."
"This poured a nice golden color with a slight haze. The smell had a wonderful hop forward character that i really enjoyed. This is a really big beer and unfortunately the abv is not masked very will. With 102 ibu's you think it would be but i think a little more malt character would have made this great. Overall i enjoyed it but I expect a little more balanced IPA."
"O- Good solid beer that fails to meet the bar West Coast IPA has set. I'm going to have to read some other reviews to see if someone else figured out that onion/garlic smell/taste I was getting. Worth trying if you like the style. Definitely different, and not a bad effort... Just not world class."
"Overall, not the most complex DIPA around, bit still a quite enjoyable, pine hop-forward, beer."
"Poured into a stemglass, a clear, dark golden color with a finger of white head that receded quickly to a thin layer of bubbles. Strong, potent hops fill the nose, and not much else to say about the aroma. Big, big hops on the tongue, with bitterness of citrus zest. Some pine and grass in there, but it's the hops that you notice more than anything. Bitter and very dry finish. You're left feeling like you've just had...an imperial IPA. Medium body and definitely drinkable if you're in the market for hops."
"Narrative: """Alright, try to calm down""" the police sketch artist pleaded """I know it is shocking, but try to remember something...anything.""" What coudl you tell him, it was so offensive and abrupt, you'd almost rather just put it behind you. """Well it was bitter...unexpected...""" ""yes yes...go on..""" God, what do you tell a complete stranger about a man who confronts you and pushes bitter hops in your mouth, """listen, I just dont feel up to this right now," you still feel its grassy stench in your nasal cavity """ANYTHING HELPS""" FINE """OK IT SMELLED LIKE PINE...PINE! Are you happy now?""" your jaw lightly clicks in the tense silence that ensues """Did...were there any hops cones or flowers left beh-""" ""HOW DARE YOU ASK ME SOMETHING LIKE THAT.""""
"Overall, this is a solid DIPA which fits the billing of both the style and ABV."
"This is a medium-carbonated beer that has a with a lighter body than I thought it'd have but it's still medium-bodied. The feel is slick yet a bit chewy. It's pretty drinkable...if you like an abundance of hops. Your palette is definitely destroyed after drinking this. I wish this was a little more well-balanced but it's definitely tasty and a must-drink for any hop head. I really want to eat a pizza with this."
"Green Flash Imperial IPA, despite the many reviews, is to me a pretty average IIPA. IT has a lot of tropical and dank hoppiness but also a bunch of sweet fruity flavors and biscuity malts. The color was darker than I was expecting and it was (to me) too sweet for what I consider the hallmark of the style--Pliny the Elder. I had no problem finishing the 11 oz from the bomber I split with a friend, but I would find it hard to drink much more than that due to the cloying and lingering bitterness and sweetness."
"The brew pours a light bright orange hue which colours remind me of a nice dusk sunset with decent carbonation that leaves behind a steady one finger head that stays and leaves heaps of clingy lacing here and there,the smell is abit different to most ADII's that i have had before and strangely enough smells very similar to weed with some subtle aromas of pineapple,wet piney hops,toffee and passionfruit aswell,it has a medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and on first sip you can tell this brew is very fresh and the first taste that hits me is tropical fruits but mainly mango and pineapple toned down a little by some boiled candy and barley sugar which in turn is nicely hit with a good wack of piney,herbal,resiny hops which beautifully counteracts any sweetness first encountered to leave you with a semi dry finish on the palette and overall its quite nice without being overley memorable cheers."
"Had a goblet for $5 at Liberty St. Tavern. Appeared a clear amber with a short white head. The beer was rich with more classic American citrus hops, along the lines of Cascades, though I don't think those are used here. But it's the same sort of earthy, not quite catty, herbal grapefruit and pine character. There's a big, sort of thick caramel malt and bread backbone that's a little fuller than I'd like. Still, overall this is a fine example of the style. Big American hops backed by rich pale barley."
"Terrific beer. Closer to a regular IPA than I expected but that's not a complaint. Some Double-IPA's lack complexity and/or subtlety. This one can hang close to the best."
"T: This is my firstl IPA from Green Flash and it's excellent. The hops are huge, fresh and citrusy but are kept in check by some biscuity hops. I'm going to have to get some more of this one."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and has great flavor. If you like high IBU beers, I think you will enjoy this one. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"Overall, very good example of my favorite style. Haven't had a beer from Green Flash that I haven't liked, and for $5.99 this was a great value taboot."
"I'm a little surprised how fast this bomber hit my gut (and my head for that matter) but what can you do? world class smell going on here and its very drinkable for a big hop bomb that should make this one worth seeking out if your a hop head"
"O - A well put together IIPA but the presence of that onion flavour took this one back a bit."
"-Cheers"
"A must try for those in search of a true hop bomb. Albeit a little one-note with the overall profile of flavors this brew is crafted incredibly well. A great hop delivery with really nice balance for such a big beer. Chuck Silva is the man and it's all about the hops!"
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a solid medium body feel but nothing spectacular. Overall, a solid double IPA but I would love to know how fresh I'm having this. It was new to the store I bought it from but that doesn't mean it was new to the distributor. I'll score it for what it is, but certainly knowing the date of bottling would be better."
"Clear, light orange-amber appearance. Throws off a strong aroma of grapefruit and fresh lemons with some metallic components. There is also a less pronounced aroma of raw green vegetables. Very dry on the palate, with lots of grapefruit, lemon and other citrus combining with a nice mouthfeel. There is faint, if any, malt profile, but that is fine for this style, which is all bitter hops."
"Overall, this is a good take on a West Coast DIPA. Huge hop presence, minor malt character to balance it, huge bitterness, sticky, lingering finish. Definitely a one and done but an enjoyable beer."
"This is a refreshing, highly hopped IPA, and with a high ABV, it really must be sipped with respect. However, at least in California, this is an imperial IPA that can really deliver the goods at a very nice price point, for the time being."
"A wonderfully enjoyable and highly drinkable DIPA. This one does everything right. It's inexpensive as well, which is always appreciated."
"Overall. A real nice best coast IIPA. Good and hoppy as it should be. Just a little boozy but that's forgivable when it tastes this good."
"Pours a clear yellow with a chill haze. Relatively small foam, good lacing and retention. Aroma of west coast hops, floral, citrusy, grapefruit. In the taste, nice tropical fruit west coast style IPA, hop forward, decent balance and a good hit of alcohol in the end. Medium bodied, alittle syrupy. Strong and tasty. Overall, I liked it but it is very intense. For a double IPA, its about right."
"not bad. kind of an odd combination of hop flavors (malts are almost undetectable from beginning to end), but it works decently in an odd way. would drink again. decent value. not my favorite imperial IPA, but its definitely interesting. as it warms, the garlic comes through more until most the citrus flavors are undetectable and the vegetable flavors take over, unfortunately."
"D: lacks the malt profile required to support this kind of hop onslaught. It's not that it's not sweet, in fact it's arguably too sweet, and it's not that it necessarily has too much hops. The problem is its one-dimensionality, lots of flavor, extreme flavor, but without the complexity that makes that interesting."
"Drinkability: Good but not quite as enjoyable as the Pliny the Elder which she had before."
"A beer that smells so good that the taste sort of disappoints. A good DIPA, but the bitterness is hard to ignore."
"Overall-Though the hops aren't the star, this is still an excellent beer. The fruit aroma and taste is great. Definitely a good represenation of a West Coast IPA(which I don't get to drink often). I really like where this beer is going, definitely going to seek out some more Green Flash products."
"Very pleasant drinking. Without that aggressive hop bitterness it's very palatable. But will need to judge a fresher bottle, really."
"It's good, and the hop profile is awesome, but a huge beer like this needs to have some sort of malt profile to back it up-there's not much malt in the aroma (which I can deal with), but I'd like some more malt character in the flavor. After about half the bottle, I'm ready to be done with it."
"D - Had this with a Pliny the Younger and Pliny the Elder, side-by-side-by-side. It tasted quite good but didn't have the complexity of either of the Russian River brews. Not surprisingly, the Imperial tasted better on-tap than from the bottle, probably because this was fresh. Given the choice, I'd take the West Coast IPA over the Imperial."
"One of my favorite IPA's of all time. Crush fresh hops in your hand and it will smell like this beer. I love this beer so much I went to their garage about an hour or so away from San Diego and told them they need to sell this in Seattle as we LOVE IPA's! They have started sending it to us!!! I bought a case of it from them at the """pub""" to bring back and had to pull all sorts of stuff out of my checked bag just so I would be under the 50 lb limit. Oh yes, it is that good!"
"D-very drinkable. Gone in no time!!"
"D: I hate to say it, because I love the GF West Coast IPA, but this one is a """one and done""" for me. Very unpleased. I blame the bottle dating problem, no the beer."
"D - Quite drinkable, a very balanced DIPA yet still will satisfy all but the most purist of hopheads."
"Loved it."
"The Summit and Nugget hops definatly add a different twist to the hop profile. Don't know how fresh this was but it didn't seem like 101 ibu's. A fine herbal DIPA."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - very manageable; it does have a strong bitter aftertaste which is not unpleasant but could be if you don't like really bitter beers. Slight alcohol burn."
"D- This is fantastic! Really glad I picked this one up! I'm really happy to have a piece of sunny San Diego in my glass! 9.4%, 101 I.B.U.'s, and only $5.99 for a bomber... Here comes the sun!!!"
"Overall, not a bad DIPA, but a bitter bomb without much complexity."
"Overall, this was below average for Green Flash. I don't got a bad one or what, but I had tons of carbonation and this didn't seem to be the case in other reviews. Also just seemed a bit out of balance, not enough aroma, and flavor starts off a bit weak. Will have to sample again and edit review if necessary."
"Fantastic beer!"
"This beer definitely defines what San Diego beer is all about. Malty, hoppy, and just as strong, if not, stronger than our former Governader Arnold."
"The intense flavor hid the alcohol well, this is an excellent beverage, it filled me with joy after every sip."
"As I tipple, the palate of the beer unfolds a fan of flavors ranging from sweet to bitter on the end. Smooth, one of the best drinks of the annum. I could imbibe nearly a gallon (in the Queen's measurements) of this fine ale. The finish is dasterdly bitter, but not overly dry. As I approach the finish I realize that that's all there is and there is to be no more. I would fancy another pint or quart."
"this beer pours a nice golden straw color with a decent white that lasts. The smell is nice, typical west coast style ipa smell, nice citrus floral hop aroma. the taste is fairly similar to the smell citrus floral hop flavors, with fairly controlled bitterness, nothing over the top bitter. the abv is fairly well hidden. the mouthfeel is a little bit heavier than normal for the style, but not as heavy as hoptimum. very drinkable. definitely worth trying"
"D: Not bad. But at 9%, it should probably not make me want to have another different beer right after I drank this one because I want more flavor."
"I was expecting more or maybe just something different out of this beer, I would like to get another bottle I know is fresh to compare to. I thought the Imperial would fall more in line with there west coast IPA which is like smelling and tasting fresh a Christmas tree(it blew me away) so I am little disappointed on how is one was but all in all this is a great beer and I would suggest people try it out."
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I will have more!"
"thanks to cduckett for the extra!"
"That sticky/dry finish is excellent, but the stickiness tends to become dominant later in the drink, hurting the drinkability. Overall this is one solid IIPA, and for the price of 6$ I'd buy this again for sure."
"Mouthfeel is a lot of hop bitterness as stated earlier. Once you get past that the slight carbonation is very nice and yields a sweet soft body. Quite pleasing despite the pinch of hop. This brew is more like a barleywine but still very flavorfull and quite drinkable. A good one to try."
"Enjoy!"
"Fantastic , balance IPA really great. Wish it was sold in more State that I could purchase because I would definitely buy this a lot."
"Poured into a tulip. Clear golden amber. Moderate head with good retention and decent lace. Aroma is big citrus, sweet fruit, tropical and juicy. Massive hop punch. Taste is big and bitter. Resinous, almost sticky, with good body. However, there was a bit of harshness in the back of the finish."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours surprisingly light golden with a small white head. Aroma is a blend of citric fruits, though not overpowering, along with a spicy kick and a sweet caramel malt backbone. A bit grassy and herbal. Flavor starts very sweet and a bit honeyish. Quickly gains a citric and sharp piney character. Bitterness in the finish but not overpowering.　Slightly oxidized hops but not too bad.　Medium body and a fizzy carbonation.　Pretty good stuff."
"D: A very good SanDiego IPA. Very hop forward - to be enjoyed by those who like this particular take on the style."
"I'd like to find a bottle I knew was fresh because what I'm tasting just doesn't jive with what I expected here."
"Mouth is smooth and good carbonation, the drinkability is ok, sort of weird, I could hardly get through a full pint."
"Another reviewer mentioned a case date of 1/5/11. I didn't see the case, but judging from the fresh supply in the cooler, I was likely drinking the same batch. I only mention because this beer does change a fair amount w/age."
"D - Well, at that high ABV this bomber will be plenty for me. Still, this was a nice treat. I've been very impressed with the Green Flash offering I've sampled and this is no exception."
"The freshness of this beer has either made a huge difference in the subtleties of the flavor, or I psyched myself out. Usually not my go-to style of beer, if I had to have just one (and just one of these will surely do) this is a good one to have."
"D- this is a different beast then most dipas and I really like it. I can't quite rap my head around what makes it stand out but ill work on it."
"Clear orange color. Thick frothy head. Plenty of lacing after. Strong smell of citrus and pine, and malt. Strong hop wallop taste of grapefruit, and biscuit flavor and some sweet malt. Medium body and pretty dry. A very hoppy and strong ale. Not bad."
"Drinkabilty - Being 9.4% and so hoppy, this 22oz is more then enough. This is intense and a hop lovers dream. I enjoy this very much but its for hopheads for sure. Green flash is making good brews."
"It is quite drinkable for such a strong flavorful beer. The alcohol is well hidden and can get you in trouble. I wish I knew how old this bottle was. I cannot see any date on the bottle. I think it may be a little old for this style. Sure wish there was a bottle date. I would try again if I knew the next bottle was fresh! I have to believe a fresh bottle will taste & smell better"
"The Green Flash Imperial is very drinkable for fans of the Double IPAs. Impressive! Fantastic! I can't say enough..."
"drinkable - probably limited to a single bomber."
"D: This is a pretty bitter beer that lends itself to sipping. Alcohol isn't all that present."
"D: I am somewhat of a fair-weather hophead and have to be in the right mood for a citrus bomb. Tonight was one of those nights."
"M/D: high marks here. Very easy drinking, and this live review went quickly."
"Balance is the key to this brew which is presently my favorite Double IPA! Treat yourself to this beer ASAP!"
"The hop oils contribute to a slick feel. The body is medium and thick. The carbonation is crisp, and the bite lasts through the dry finish. This one is certainly easy to drink, I need to catch myself and slow down because this 9% delight is quickly diminishing. I'm another notch in your bed post Green Flash, and I thank you for that."
"I have a feeling this may be a touch dated but still very good."
"This (I)IPA has a light and frothy appearance. The smell is earthy, noting an interesting combination of grapefruit and pine needles. The taste is very hoppy and smooth. Although having a high alcohol content(9.4%), it's taste is masked by the thick; but delightful, earthy flavor of hops. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and frothy. While not being the most complex IPA from San Diego county, this has definately become one of my favorites."
"Not enough depth for me, but certainly a very good IIPA."
"3Dec"
"Notes: Put a bottling date on your beers, especially IPAs and DIPAs! It's not that hard, and this small deed would be so helpful and informative to the consumer. Thank you to breweries like Dogfish Head and Russian River who have been doing this for years."
"Damn, this is too good -- a big guy, but very enjoyable & light on its feet. Alcohol & hops are pretty serious, but I could probably have a few of these. One of my favorite DIPAs."
"D: An absolute palate wrecker, but much more balanced than the brewery's regular IPA, for those looking for better balance. It is also worth noting that this beer doesn't have any alcohol bite."
"Fairly drinkable, about average for the style. One 22oz bottle will be enough for me, but I can see myself ordering a few glasses of this at a bar (assuming it arrives in something more reasonable than a full pint glass)."
"One for the serious hopheads. Quite an interesting nose of citrus, dried herbs, sweet jelly and a hint of the malt-just a hint. An absolute ball-tearing bitterness in the mouth that lingers on forever. Herbal with some white pepper undertones. Moreish, satisfying and full-on. A true benchmark IIPA. Can't get enough of this."
" Would love to pound these all night if I could afford - GREAT BREW!!!!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Despite my first misgivings in the taste department, this is my favorite incarnation of the IPA to date. Truly worth the price of admission."
"poured from a 22 oz bomber it was a hazy copper color with a good head with some lacing.smell is hops both floral and pine with a stale malt background..taste was hops first with pine and grapefruit they were faint in taste IMO but could smell them it finished with a balnd stale malt taste that kinda ruined the hops..still not bad.mouth feel is medium and creamy its just not a top notch dipa..it is good the bomber dissapeared it was just not a wow dipa"
"D- bitterness does go well with most meat. i'f i had a steak, i'd have another."
"Nicely done."
"The feel is fantastic and is the first time in awhile that I've been totally taken aback by a beer's hop level. Really, really strong bitterness and a body that doesn't support that bitterness, which is something I mean in a very good way. Very intriguing; I like this quite a bit and wish I hadn't waited so long to have my first."
"Overall, I was impressed with this beer. It was not what I expected which is always fun. I have never smelled or tasted hops like this before. I think i said """it's so piney!""" several times during the consumption (and this post). The beer started strong and finished strong. I am attracted to beers that set themselves apart from others. I can appreciate the brew-masters who take risks to create something different. This was a successful risk in my opinion considering I have never tasted hops that were this potent. It was easy to drink and I will definitely buy it again."
"D- halved a bomber with a mate, and i dont think i could have more than a full one. not the most drinkable of beers, but very tasty though."
"At this time there's not much on my stomach but the beer from last night and a single bit of toast. Is it for that reason that I'm buzzed off half a bomber or is it just that this beer is 9.4% and that would have happened anyway? Regardless, I might want to drink more but this beer would put me on my arse (and possibly you on yours) after more than a glass or two."
"D: I'm very, very happy I made this purchase - this is a solid IPA that I would probably pick up again (if there weren't so many other beers I want to try first....)"
"Very drinkable. This beer NEEDS to be warmed up to proper temperature. Don't be afraid to let it reach room temp. Highly recommend this beer. Probably the best offering from GF."
"medium-full body and prickly tickly. Finishes slightly bitter with all the hoppy flavor and aroma staying in the game all the way through the finish."
"D - Wouldn't session it but a damn tasty DIPA."
"This is unapologetic, and while it really only does one thing - dose you up with clean and fresh hops - it does it well. The lightness in turn aids the drinkability, although at 9.4% ABV you probably want to share a bomber anyway. Tasty brew nonetheless."
"D-- Two bombers in a sitting would be a tough task to do on a normal day. AVB is decently hidden. About halfway through the beer started feeling the ABV. Still this is a good DIPA. Not a good as PTE is or Hercules is but a good alternative to what is there."
"Pours a hazy gold into a pint glass with a lingering one finger head. The smell is straight up hops. The taste is of beautifully bitter hops. For such a jacked up beer, it's mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent. However, the alcohol content is certainly felt by bomber's end. A delightfully delicious hoppy beer."
"Cheers.."
"D: It's not world-class, IMO. But I'd get it once in a while for its enamel-ripping satisfaction, especially if it were $5 a bomber."
"D: Amazing drinkability for being 9.4%."
"D- Green flash is not bad. It didn't have the flavor that I wanted for a DIPA. Still a pretty good sipping brew"
"D- The appearance and smell of this DIPA suggested something that the taste and finish didn't really come through on, for some reason. Certainly a tasty beer but I can't quite help but feel that something is missing. Excellent for the price, though."
"Picked up a bomber of this one for less than five bucks, and I was pretty excited to try it. Unlike most of Green Flash's other offerings, however, this one was a major let down. This one pours a clear medium amber color, with a small, tight white head. All kinds of hops going on on the nose--citrus, earth, weed and herbs. On the palate however, the hops become too much, and dominate in an unpleasant, unbalanced sort of way. Not bad, necessarily, but nothing I'd willingly reach for again."
"I absolutely love this beer! I've had it on many occasions and finally decided to review it. Green flash is one of my favorite breweries that is readily available to me in this shit town of Fresno. Pours a clear, dark golden color with a big white head that goes down slowly and leaves some beautiful lacing. Scent is full of grapefruit and melon with a strong hop presence. You could notice the hops right after opening this one. Great citrus scent with a bit of sweet malts. The taste is very piney with a caramel malt flavor that is not too much...making it a great candidate for an awesome west-coast DIPA. The hops are not overly bitter and the beer just blends all its flavors so well. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy with a big, bold full-body. The alcohol is SO WELL HIDDEN for how high the ABV is. Drinkability is high. This is definitely up there with Pliny, HopSlam, Dreadnaught, Maharaja, Double Trouble, Ruination, and the other great DIPAs out there."
"Suggested for any hop head."
"D= Very solid beer for me would try it again."
"D: A very solid IIPA, flavors are all there and the ABV is hidden well. Classic example of a west coast IPA. A good price on this one too."
"Drinking from a batch that was bottle the 25th of June and this is exceptional. This is truly the West Coast IPA on steroids. The nose was heavily infected with hops. The taste was extremely bitter, I was really hoping for this in this beer, because past bottles haven't been anything special. This was the first time that I was able to find a batch date on the case that it came from. I can only speculate that the others were not as fresh as this. This was AWESOME!"
"Not incredibly drinkable, but definitely a fine brew."
"Poured from a 22oz into a pint glass. Light amber/orange color with a huge, billowy head. excellent lacing. Slightly cloudy but for the most part is transparent. Loads of tiny little bubbles can be seen if you look real close. Smells hoppy, a woodsy. Very pleasant on the nose. Wow, the taste is very different than what I expected. Hops are present, but it's more mild and balanced than I would have expected. Not a significant malt presence either. A little bit of grapefruit coming through. The 9.40% ABV is incredibly well-hidden. Medium to light bodied with the presence of carbonation coming through. Very tasty and drinkable and given the ABV this could be a dangerous one to like too much."
"d- really great, i'm loving this. it goes down a bit too easily. i would gladly drink this again anytime."
"Taste is very fruity, fresh and hoppy. There is a nice malty backing that's sweet and pretty damn delicious. Overall a solid beer. I wish they had freshnes dates though!"
"Excessively hopped with just enough malt to get by. Without a doubt, this beer goes down the righteous path to Imperial IPA and is a trophy beer for any veteran hophead."
"D- I liked it, but I personally don't mind the alcohol bite. I could see how it might turn someone else off."
"Taste: Starts off malty sweet, morphing quickly to a cornucopia of Western hops with a bitter closing note which lingers. Alcohol is nicely in check for a higher alcohol brew. Nicely done there. Problem (if one can say it's a problem) is that it is merely a maltier version of the WCIPA which breaks no new ground nor is particularly representative or respectful of the style (which is kind of an amalgam of styles at that). In that sense, I have a similar complaint to the one I have about their Hop Head Red which, though a well crafted effort;,./, seems to me to be a WCIPA version of a red ale. While they do work, the comparison with the original leaves both of them wanting."
"Pours a very light golden color with 2 fingers of head, decent amount of carbonation. Smells are hops! Lots of hops and some citrus, smells delicious. Taste is malt at the front, then bitter with a nice hop finish, very tasty. Mouthfeel is nice with a drying finish, perfect amount if carb. Drinkability is good, can't wait to get try this one again."
"An excellent IIPA and a Must Try for any hophead. Love the Nugget - Taste the Nugget!"
"Overall, a very good DIPA, but like most I've had from the west coast, lacking just enough not to be epic."
"Drinkability: Damn good beer and a reasonably priced bomber. I wish the finish was a little less dry and bitter and a little more on the sweet side."
"Green Flash Brewing Company--Imperial India Pale Ale--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 9.40% ABV. 101 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) Creamy foamy lacy white head. Cloudy bright orange gold color. Big smooth floral hop front. Crisp mildly cloying dry tangy pine hop resin pale caramel dough body. Hop-Hoppy balanced rich smooth end. Nice sedating hops. Sampled 6/8/2010. $6.49 Each."
"Was hoping for a little more since the West Coast IPA is pretty damn tasty."
"D-Big flavors. I love the taste. The bitterness makes it a bit difficult to drink more than two glasses. Alcohol is present but well hidden."
"D- Faint flavors for the style and alcohol content. But, as it warmed it did open up some more. This is by no means bad, but it is not going to be a beer that I remember."
"D - Love the west coast IPA's, and super happy to see an Imperial from Green Flash!!!"
"Solid addition to the stable of IPA's that boast multiple hopping and increased alcohol content. Would like to taste on tap before elevating this brew to the status among such luminaries as Three Floyds Dreadnaught or Bells Hopslam."
"M & D - Well balanced DIPA with a good grapefruit sweetness and nice citrus hop blast. Delicious and very drinkable. Green Flash impresses again."
"This is an interesting IIPA. It breaks the mould of C-hop driven IIPAs but the hop choices are odd to say the least and don't necessarily deliver."
"D- Very easy to finish one bomber, however toward the end you tend to start noticing the heat on the finish, one of these was enough than move on to another IPA to finish."
"D - I was really impressed with how balanced this beer was for having 101 IBUs...the alcohol is not present one bit...this is my favorite Green Flash beer"
"D: wow. Incredibly smooth, complex, and enjoyable. great representation of a West Cost Ipa! I'd be hard pressed to find a better imperial ipa."
"From the 22 fl.oz. bottle. Sampled on August 1, 2010. The pour is copper-yellow with a muted haziness that eliminates some of the clarityu in a marginal fashion. The aroma comes on strong with its bready hoppiness but there is also a kind of green apple and grapefruit sourness in the mix. It really digs into my throat when I taste it clearing out the senses with its boild hops and odd caramel fudge sweetness. It has some great qualities but it is not a beer I would drink frequently."
"9.4 percent? Wow I am feeling pretty good but have no idea how I got there. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and taste is right up front."
"so recommended...."
"D - I wish I had a second bottle. This beer is great."
"I had been looking forward to trying this one for a while. It pours a light orange colour with soapy white head and lots of lacing. Smell is just a blasting of hop aroma, pine and tropical fruits. Lots of bitterness here, but that is what I want in a IIPA. Huge hop bite in the flavour with some caramel malt in there too, somwhere. Nice carbonation level. This is up there with my favourite IIPA's."
"D - An Adventure really."
"*=ideas from fellow taster"
"Decent imperial, nothing crazy special."
"D - Very drinkable for a DIPA over 9% and quite refreshing on a cooling night after a hot humid summer day."
"OVERALL: A little disappointed with this one. Looked great and the aftertaste delivered at least something, but the initial taste was almost non-existent and nose had a little odd soapy quality to it that didn't quite jive with me. Still drinkable enough, just not all that much going on. This was the least appealing of the Green Flash line-up I was able to try. I enjoyed their regular IPA and their Hop Head Red, but I'd pass on this one."
"Overall, a nice, big, bitter DIPA that really delivers with strong hop flavors. The hops tend to be a bit bitter and that can get overpowering. My only problem is that the aromatic tropical fruit notes seemed absent or covered up in the flavor."
"D-its a decent beer, but not one of my favorite DIPA's that I've tried; it's good but doesn't really """wow""" me. I have no idea what the bottling date is, so maybe it's not as fresh as it should be. I was a little nervous before trying it because of the 101 IBU indication, but it's not as mouth-numbingly bitter as I was expecting."
"M/D- Medium-light bodied with decent carbonation. easy drinking beer. not as bitter as i was expecting for the IBU rating on this, otherwise nice beer, minus the alcohol notes."
"Drinkability- Awesome, loved it, Very nice DIPA!!, Gonna get more of this"
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Nice copper yellow pour with nice foamy head and great lacing. All floral and hop resin in the nose! Very earthy. The taste is much the same. Really nice earthy, bitter, resiny hops that will make you pucker. Hops are the star here, but there's a nice caramel-toffee malt undertone to it also that adds some balance. Great chewy, resiny, oily mouthfeel. Hugely drinkable for an imperial. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. I killed a bomber in no time and was craving a second. This is a hop heads dream. When I die, I hope I go to San Diego. Great beer!"
"great drinkability for a 9%. big hops flavor and bite and bitterness."
"Overall- Expected a bit more, but it is still a very solid beer."
"Very upfront hop bitterness that is well balanced by the malt. It does not taste like it's 9.4% and it leaves your mouth very dry with a tingle at the back of the tongue. This is an excellent beer."
"This was pretty good for what it was. Easily sipped. Easy drinker. Just thought there'd be more to it."
"Not in the ballpark with Pliny the Elder, but we're definitely still playing the same game. The guys in San Diego definitely know how to pack gobs of hops into a beer. Really well done, Green Flash."
"Overall I was very impressed with this DIPA from Green Flash for its fresh taste and excellent hop profile and balance. This to me is extremely similar to Pliny the Elder and that is always a great thing. Recommended."
"The only complaint is it was a tad too sweet (probably due to age). Nevertheless it was definitely one of the most drinkable DIPA's I have had."
"This is the beer that I have been comparing other to, even Pliny the Elder. There are a few other companies in northern CA that are similar, but not with the same intense hoppy flavor of this San Diego area beer. I wnat to try it on tap."
"Definitely worth a try if you like strong, bitter, hoppy IPAs, get on board. I am not going to say I'll be a regular on this in that it's a bit too much for me with the hops and vegetable taste but it's still a quality IPA. Just not my cup of tea."
"In the taste I get the bitterness until almost the end when the malt comes in and balances it out. The hops have more of piney/resiny taste then the nose would indicated - I get less of the fruitiness on the palate. Not quite as balanced as some double/imperial IPAs but being a west coast beer that's not too surprising."
"D: decnt high gravity DIPA from green flash. Drinks good down to the bottom, will get some more soon."
"overall: another winner from green flash well crafted damn fine beer. better then most Double IPAs I have had."
"I prefer West Coast IPA and Hop Head Red, two fine brews from Green Flash. But this comes real close."
"Although I very much enjoyed this beer, I prefer Green Flash's West Coast IPA, as it's unbalanced in just the right way. I will look forward to having this DIPA again."
"Wow. I really hope to have this again someday, and I wonder how the bottled version holds up to this, one of the best tap-drinking experiences of my life."
"This is yet another quality DIPA. This beer is fairly well balanced, perhaps a bit punchy, but this is also likely to be what others thoroughly enjoy about this beer and the style in general."
"Incredible Double IPA."
"D- I finished the bomber, but I could imagine cracking open another if I had it, which can be a good thing."
"From a 22oz. bomber poured into a tulip glass. Nice, big frothy head forms and has great retention. The color is lighter than a lot of imperials, less orange and more of a yellowish amber. The hops have a big sweet, citrus fruity aroma. They smell pretty fresh too, which hopefully means this bottle is relatively young. The hops don't come across on the palate all that well though. The malt overshadows things a bit until the finish where the hop resin lingers. Nice mouthfeel though. Not too heavy to make it quite drinkable despite the lacking of up front hop flavor."
"Not impressed with this beer. All IBU's are alive and kicking, leaves a big bitterness at the back of the tongue after each sip. A heavy dose of malt as well, making the feel thick and syrupy, but ample carbonation makes the mouthfeel good, very understated on the tongue. I've never had an Imperial IPA that tasted so damn heavy on the malt, yet so damn bitter with the hops, I almost wish one would dominate the other so they weren't fighting the character of the beer. The bitterness is penetrating, everlasting in it's power, and the malt almost seems like the wrong malt used (pale) where is the caramel?"
"An awesome DIPA and a great representation of a west coast style one at that. I would welcome this one any day."
"A strong brew, so I'm only having one tonight, but you can count of me having another in the future."
"Cloudy orange with a large 2-inch white head which settled quickly. Lacing is light but present and carbonation is excellent for this style. The nose was pine, lemon and grapefruit. Taste was sweet and soft. The Pine is upfront but the citrus and a sweet malt underbelly make this more than a burn-your-mouth hop bomb. There was a pleasing, mildly bitter aftertaste. Although it does not feel thin, it is soft and smooth for an Imperial IPA. Except for the ABV, I wanted more and will go back to this again."
"Drinkability - Not bad at all. VERY drinkable for the abv - though it doesn't hide the alcohol very well. Tastes pretty good, but at the end of the day doesn't have the dynamic flavor profile I come to expect from the style - comes off as more of a boozy IPA."
"IPAs, to me, are always really attractive beers. This beer, in a tulip, was exceptional. Gold color, thick white head, lots of lacing. I'm a sucker for lace. Some malt, but mostly citrus aroma. Big citrus/grapefruit taste, malt presence. The beer was pretty well balanced, still a big hit of hops."
"SO much better than their West Coast IPA which was tooo bitter for my taste and I like IPA's. I just like balanced IPA's. The imperial delivers from the hazy coppery head, large off white foam, pine on the nose, grapefruit hidden behind, to the sweet fading to bitter long lasting finish. Thoroughly enjoyed this one although like most IPA's it's definitely not one you want to drink more than a couple of in one sitting."
"The beer Appears orange/ gold with a small ring of foam. The smell is very earthy, Grassy, pine and citrus like. The smell is dominated by hops. The taste like the smell is hop dominated. Rich citrus, grapefruit, grassy hops coat the roof of your mouth. A tad bit of sweetness is also there. A very sharp bitter aftertaste that lingers is present. Bitterness sticks to the roof of your mouth for a long time. Though it is high on alcohol, the body of the beer is quite light so I could drink a few of these. The carbonation is moderate. It is an excellent citrusy hop bomb. highly recommended to anyone who likes citrusy bitter IIPAs."
"Nice orange tint to the color, with a decent head that left quickly, but left nice traces on the glass. The maltiness was there, but with an Imperial the hops are doubled, so the hops are what certainly stuck out. Bright mouth filling from the hops, and the taste certainly kept that feeling alive. Finished the bottle, but certainly couldn't do another, as overall it was certainly hefty. Nicely done for an Imperial."
"Honey orange with a creamy bone colored head that leaves tons of sticky lace on the glass. Huge, resinous hoppy nose bursting with grapefruit rind, pine sap and eucalyptus. Spicy and herbal hop flavors with enough malt backbone to just balance. I really like the herbal flavors the Summit and Nugget hops deliver, tobacco leafy spice and sprucy pine. Finishes bitter and a little bit warm. Creamy and full bodied with a slippery hop oily quality. This beer is incredibly easy to drink even at 9.4% ABV and over 100 IBU's."
"Another good beer from Green Flash, wish I could get them more often."
"Quite enjoyable DIPA from the region which spawned it. The sweet tangerine as opposed to the more common tart grapefruit is a welcome take on the style. Alcohol is quite heavy and apparent, but I suppose that is what one seeks when drinking an imperial."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D: Went down smooth, would definitely drink again!"
"Mouth/Drink: Nice thick mouthfeel. Good medium carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer and when I can get my hands on more, I definitely will."
"No doubt this is a good beer from GF, sessionable (well, for the extreme types) and good bodied but not too bold."
"D: Very drinkable IPA. Wish the hops weren't so subdued in the taste. Would love to have this readily available in our area."
"A: Deep gold to orange in color, quickly dissipating head, crystal clear, no lacing - 4.00, S: Absolutely loaded with green and pungent hop aromas, tons of pine and tree sap, edges towards the side of earthy - I would have guessed Simcoe hops though the label indicates Nugget and Summit, stellar aroma for an Imperial IPA - 4.75, T: Strong earthy hop bite, pine and grapefruit pith, alcohol is quite noticeable, some burnt raisin and rum soaked cake, I pick up the slightest bit of green grass - 4.50, Somewhat syrupy mouth feel - 4.50, D: For an Imperial IPA, this is extremely drinkable that pushes the limits of hop usage - 4.50"
"The Imperial IPA pours a golden orange color into the SN pint glass. Small but nice frothy white head with good retention and lots of lacing on the glass. Aromas are faint but contain a nice sweetness with some hops in the background. Also citrus and pines are present. Quaff is really bitter and much more dominated with hops in comparison to the nose. A creamy texture is noticeable to me. Also some grapefruit and breads are noticed on the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied with lots of hops bouncing on the palate. Drinkability is high but in comparison to other west coast IPA's slightly lower. Still a great beer but not quite what some of the others are."
"Overall, a very solid imperial IPA. Definitely one I'd get again or recommend to fellow hop-heads."
"The body was fairly typical for the style, but still very good. Drinkability was very good for such a bold example of the style. Overall, worth your time and worth seeking out."
"Overall: Good representation of the style. Not my favorite Imperial IPA but it's still very good. I would recommend it."
"I'm grading this a B halfway through my second glass, and I can say the flavour improves with temperature. It's solid, but I can think of five other IIPAs in thie price bracket that I'd go to before this one."
"On tap at 515 in Santa Cruz. Pours gold with a nice white head that leaves thin filmy lacing. Aroma is garlicky hops, herbs, and pale malts. Flavor is heavy on herbal hops but that garlic is throwing me off. There's also some sweeter citrus influence but it's mild. Not a lot of malt presence but that may be a result of tasting this after an imperial red. Seems dry and bitter enough, but the hop profile could easily be improved."
"D: This beer proves in my mind to be another delicious presentation from Green Flash that produces its own interesting identity within the realm of Imperial IPA's. Personally I love the hoppy qualities of the beer and would have no inhibitions to continue drinking it. However, I would caution to those who are turned off by higher levels of bitterness in beer because this one can pack a punch. Overall I was very pleased and would highly recommend trying it."
"Drinkable for sure...a nice DIPA. Slightly lacking in flavor though..."
"Definitely drinkable, though rather high in alcohol so you gotta pace yourself. It's a great DIPA, though not as piney tasting as I would have liked"
"Poured into a goblet, pours a nice golden yellow color with a one finger white head that dissipated quickly to crown the beer. Great citrus and pine aromas initially, with the alcohol following through. Taste is more piney than the smell, with the citrus and alcohol more present on the finish. Feel is a little more than medium bodied and has a good oily finish for the DIPA. Very good drinkable beer for the style and quite enjoyable."
"the appearance was fresh, the smell had that cali smell to it, wasn't dank with hops, the taste smooth, the hops did not attack or overhaul the beer, i don't know how they do it, but the technique is awesome. mouthfeel allowed me to have a session if the alcohol didn't get tipsy so quick. drinkability is delicious. thank you very much!"
"D: very refreshing and drinkable"
"D- No problem downing a whole 22oz bomber of this. This is a beer that I could have a couple of but I would definitely be feeling pretty fuzzy inside at nearly 10%ABV."
"overall a very nicely made IIPA."
"Clear, golden-hued Imperial IPA with some nice lacework, good mouthfeel and the right amount of carbonation. Hop flavors are indeed intense; lots of tropical fruit flavors, but also a good peppery kick. Very dry for the style, with ridiculously assertive """hot""" bitterness accented by a bit of alcohol burn."
"Mouthfeel is good, could maybe be a bit more full given the incredibly intense flavour, but despite that, this beer has just become one of my favourite DIPAs and I'd love to try it on tap."
"D-extremely tasty and great mouthfeel. tons of bitterness at the finish make it a little less inviting, though."
"D: Insanely quaffable. Dangerously so, in fact. I'd say this is one of the better DIPAs on the market, especially for the price."
"D: No complaints here. I could make use of this one all evening."
"Liberal pour relases a nice clear copper with sunshine highlights beneath a two finger thick head that recedes to nothing. Once the beer warms alitle, youare transported to a bakery located right next to an orange grove. The taste starts out with some sharp bitterness. Then the alcohol helps warm up some of the bread crust flavors. The palate is a little twangy an metallic at the start, but finishes resiny and marmalade and hop sweet. Pretty good sipping DIPA."
"Drinkability: Strong. See note above about how the flavor of the beer changes as it warms up."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable for all of it's flavor and punch it goes down amazingly smooth."
"Poured it into a tulip glass and the smell rocked my world."
"Taste, a little much malt heft and whatnot for my preference. Their single Ipa is much better for going to the edge of the cliff with the hops, this one seems to jump up the malt bill a little much for San Diego style. All in all a good beer, just not incredible like the single."
"Mouthfeel is thick and slightly clingy. Bitter, but drinkable."
"8 oz draw at the Stone Brewery. Dirty yellow with a very dense white head. The aroma is predominantly grapefruit with grassy undertones. Noticeable alcohol in the upper palate and a bit on the sweet side. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. Soft finish with some (but not overwhelming) bitterness."
"M/D - This beer is way too easy to drink. At 10% ABV, it goes down just as easy as a session beer."
"A good ale :)"
"Overall impression: Nice DIPA from a brewery that always seems to deliver."
"Wonderful."
"D - This is a very bright and drinkable DIPA with an out of the ordinary hop profile. The hops are very strong, but much like DFH 90, there is more than an average amount of malt balancing. The hops are exceptionally fruity with a character that, more than anything else, resembles candied oranges. The malt is big and sweet, enough so that it makes the bitterness seem much more mild than it must be, but it finishes reasonably dry and makes for a balanced beer. This is quite drinkable for a beer of this size and depth and I would highly recommend it."
"D: Pretty solid beer. Not my favorite IIPA but quite good and I'll have it again."
"Drinkability/Overall: I could put a couple of these bombers away, as the complicated hop experience hides the potent alcohol content. The thinness of the look and feel take away from this brew's power, though. I'd reach for one again if I were in the mood for a straight-up hop bomb, which I am from time to time."
"Poured a two-finger offwhite head with sticky lace patches all down glass on top of auburn-tinted gold. Great citric and floral hop smell; almost soapy with minor malt (bready). A good hop taste with citric notes but I was expecting a little more hops for a DIPA. Well-balanced, medium-bodied, with a smoother finish with a little sweet malt thrown in (even a little sticky and bready in the finish). Not a powerful DIPA but still a good beer with solid hop presence and a little sweetness that makes it enjoyable."
"Verdict: Based on how much I liked West Coast IPA, I had big hopes for this beer, which ended up not being totally fulfilled. The hop bill may be a little untraditional, but the end result is still a serviceable Double IPA that's worth a try."
"Overall this beer is just... I had hoped for so much more! It's unbalanced. The bitterness is both too much, and not enough. It needs more, or it needs less. But for 7 bucks in Manhattan, for a 9.4% beer... I'll take it."
" Bravo! I'll buy this again and again."
"D: I could drink this on a daily basis and the +9% abv I can not find. A very drinkable IIPA and I hope to find some more because this was a fantastic beer. Go pick some up or trade for a fresh bottle because this is a great beer."
"D- this beer was gone pretty quickly and was very enjoyable. the smell is fantastic. check this one out if you get the chance. green flash knows how to use hops."
"The aroma is above average but it had an unbelievable POP it could be one of the best overall."
"everything about the appearance of this beer is perfect. ill be honest just about everything period about this beer is near perfect. the hops are up front and dominant, but the creamy mouthfeel brings it down to earth. if it were not for the abv ad the danger of passing out with the dogs, id drink it all night. yum yum yum"
"As far as drinkability, with the major bitterness I really wouldn't be reaching for two bombers of this in one sitting."
"D - Good even with 9% abv."
"As noted above, the aroma was a little off in this one and I am thinking it may have been an older bottle. This is still a great DIPA and at $4.99 a bottle, a very good deal."
"Top notch beer..and with a $4.99 price tag for a 22 ounce I would definitely purchase this again in the future."
"Overall: The label really brought me to this one with its boasting of 101 IBU I was hooked and had to try it. I'm not completely in favor of the choice of selection with the hops and would have favored some centennial or amarillo but this choice will suffice and does get the job done for an IIPA."
"D- I could drink this like a pale ale but then I'd be an alcoholic."
"22oz bomber from Premier Gourmet. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber. Just looks delicious and smells quite piney. Huge hop bomb. The hop bite and grapefruit bitterness just attacks your tongue and palate. This was quite tasty and easy to drink, considering the abv%. Would definately consider getting this again."
"D) Great hoppy taste and quite refreshing."
"If you're after a hop bomb, you've come to the right place. It's a good beer if what you're after is the stab-you-in-the-face intense DIPA. However, the malt profile was kind of overshadowed, and I was hoping for a slightly bigger nose."
"D- It is a good beer to be enjoyed occasionally. I myself had this at Map Room in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood...also Map Room was a must go to bar in Men's Journal magazine."
"D) Yum. I'd have another and tell a friend to drink one too. Well done Green Flash!"
"D - Have you lost your mind? 100+ IBU. 9% ABV. This ale is out of control. Recommended."
"D - Strong and flavorful but also very refreshing."
"Recommended, but not a best-of-style in my opinion. Drinkability is low, typical. That said, worth a try."
"Looks great - slightly cloudy, orangeish tint, decent lacing; pretty much textbook. A nice odor of grassy & floral hops. Unfortunately, the taste is dominated by aspirin bitterness from front to back. usually with a DIPA you get an aromatic hop hit before bitterness takes over - not here. The bitterness so dominates that other flavours are flattened. I prefer more flavourful and aromatic hops. YMMV. Mouthfeel: medium body, appealing carbonation. Reasonably quaffable overall, but nothing I'm dying to return to anytime soon."
"The taste is a bit less balanced than the smell. The pine and bitter flavors actually pack quite a punch right from the beginning. The citrus peel and peach sweetness is there, but not in the amount I was expecting. The finish has a biscuit and grass duo along with a very faint but unusual anise / mint quality from the hops. I generally prefer a bit more of the citrus sweetness to come through in a DIPA, but there is definitely more than enough material here to entertain the most devout hophead."
"Due to the bitterness it is not the most drinkable DIPA out there, however a good DIPA isn't something you drink all night, if that was the case it'd be an IPA. Very good offering from Green Flash, something all hop lover should try."
"Poured a cloudy amber with a generous head that showed good retention. The aroma was hops citrus. The taste was a hops grapefruit with a pine needle bitter aftertaste. However, as it warmed the malt sweetness started to assert itself. The feel was light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was also good. A very good Imperial IPA, not as good as Dreadnaught, but better than Founders Double Trouble. Maybe compares well to DFH Burton Baton."
"Due to the unbalance of this one i scored the drinkability a 3. I was really disappointed in this one. I've had other beers from green flash that i really enjoyed. This not being one of them."
"It's a drinkable enough Dbl. IPA as the body is quite nice and creamy thick with maltyness and has just enough zip of hops to kick it in gear. Not at all like some huge beastly hopped up bittered brutes that are out there. However, it did remind me alot of Rush Rivers' Double Bubble...with its smokey content; which I also liked."
"this is just a GREAT double IPA...pours fantastic with a head that wont quit...it smells great..piney and u can smell every hop and then some...the first taste tells you that ur really gonna love this beer...of all the doubles I've had this is in my top 5 for sure..."
"Great. Fucking. Beer."
"drinkability: a bomber of bitter hops - beware"
"A tasty entry. I would throw this in the mix with Southern Tier and Stone for my favorite double IPAs. If you're in the mood for a strong IPA, give this one a whirl. Thin smoked gouda was an ok pairing, but I think a smoked or a sharp cheddar would be perfect with this one."
"d: really easy to drink. hands down my go to imperial ipa. a must for anyone who loves a """hoppy beer""" at a reasonable price!"
"Notes: I had heard good things about this Green Flash beer prior to buying it (which led me to try it). I am not impressed."
"D - not for me, I won't try again. If you like piney hops, this is for you."
"D: This beer lived up to my expectations. Spicy, fruity, piney hop complexity. Went down smooth and I will drink it whenever I see it."
"Neat."
"D: As much as I loved this beer, it is not something you can sit down and drink several bottles of. Still a great IIPA."
"At 9.4% abv, this is much more drinkable than many similar abv IIPAs (Maharaja, Dorado)."
"overall a great beer but kinda of a let down when compared to the green flash ipa which i would drink over this everytime but i am glad i tried it"
"D- Again, pretty drinkable.l I could have enjoyed another of these had they not tempted me with so many other treats that I had yet to try. Not sessionable, however."
"Overall I am enjoying this beer. As stated before I have had stronger IPA and this is a DIPA."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. I wanted to get another one of these but Pliny the Elder was back on tap (was out when I first got there) so I got that instead. Overall I was pretty impressed with this beer."
"D: Top notch all the way. A perfect example of a west coast imperial. Recommended to both friends and foes on this one, its just that good."
"Excellent Imperial IPA which seems to embody everything I'm looking for in an imperial IPA. Nice bold hop blast up front, with a deep malt behind it. Nice, not overwhelming bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel great with good carbonation. High ABV was not evident in the mix. I could drink several of these with some barbecue."
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter. No freshness or bottled on date that I could find. Got about an inch of head and a good amount of carbonation. Could smell this brew from about 2 feet away citrus and pine notes right upfront. The flavor profile is like a real hop bomb in my mouth. Very smooth mouthfeel not syrupy at all which makes this both easy and a real pleasure to drink. The high ABV is hidden pretty well by the IBU's, but still has a warming effect after a few sips."
"This is my first offering from Green Flash and it is very, very good. A bit pricey, but not as much as Ruination. And better in my opinion. Could easily become a goto DIPA. Well balanced. A very fine brew indeed."
"A hop monster that won't let up..."
"Drinkability is nice too. It hides the alcohol well and is refreshing despite the heavy hop load."
"This is an excellent example of a West Coast hop bomb with huge pine and citrus from start to finish and enough malt to keep things from getting out of line. Very, very good stuff."
"unles it blows me away, this style is still hard for me to rate, this is a good brew, but second tier to the style..."
"A great, well crafted, beer."
"good DIPA! would like to see the alcohol hidden a bit but overall a great DIPA."
"I love this brewery. Appearance is great, with an oily look and great head and lacing. Smell and taste are very similar, nice blast of west coast hops right away. THeres is a bit of citrus and sweet malt but its overpowered by the nice hops. Mouthfeel is very oily with some carbonation. Medium in body. Drinkability is very good."
"M/D: Creamy and rich with good body, a great drink"
"Poured from an ultra fresh 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my nonic pint glass. The DIPA appears a hazed golden amber color with an inch of fluffy off white foam. The head leaves behind a thick sticky lace as I sip my way to the bottom of the glass. Notes of red and white grapefruit juice, earthy resinous pine, tropical pineapple, tangerine, toasted and caramelized sweet malt and apricot dominate the aroma and flavor of this Imperial IPA. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied for its style with ample carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden making this a pleasure to drink. Excellent stuff!"
"Would for sure buy again and recommend to any hop lover!"
"Highly drinkable given it's ABV. Well balanced and well made beer. If you like IIPA, you should try this one."
"pretty big mouthfeel, goes down very smooth. good carbonation. very good drinkability for 101 ibu's. doesnt knock your teeth out, but definately isnt lacking anything. great beer, reccomend it to all."
"Pretty solid all around but not a favorite"
"cheers"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It pours a really light orange color with a white head that leaves some really nice lacing down the glass. The smell is really hoppy, I got lots of pine of first followed by a lot of grapefruit. It smells pretty hoppy, pretty good smell. Taste is really great! A lot of grapefruit and pine in the taste. Really hoppy, has a great taste to it. Pretty bitter but not extreme, I really like it. With a fairly high ABV it's easily drinkable. I'm going to be picking up this one again for sure."
"Overall this is a solid DIPA, though it's just a hair away from being great. Still, worth a shot."
"I've given this one more than a couple of chances to impress me but some how it seems to just fall short of some of my other favorites in the IPA class. That being said, this is still a better than average IPA! It has an insane amount of flavor right off the bat. Very heavy on the herbs and spices. This beer pours great and is served best at 45-50 degrees. The smell and feel add to the allure of this ale. I rate the drinkability if this one only a 4.0 as the herbs and spices make this a one or two beer max. per outing."
"Not as bitter as I expected, but very hoppy. Great beer, and great first beer for me from green flash."
"- Quite smooth... just doesn't quite have the flavor profile I like in an IIPA... but over all decent."
"Thanks to Canucklehead for the bottle!"
"Drinkability: This is certainly a fine DIPA, but I think it lacks a little something in the flavor profile - just doesn't have the suck your taste buds dry aspect of many other DIPA"
"D: I love this beer, I can drink this down just fine! I will be buying this one again."
"Thoroughly satisfying and yet another amazing selection from Green Flash."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew at 9%, but one is definitely enough. Not mingblowing, but an interesting beer nonetheless."
"D- Pretty good for the style and mouthfeel. A good one from GF."
"Pours a clear orange with a thick white head. Lots of lacing. A nice, sweet grassy, pine, citrus hop aroma. The initial taste is sweet and malt, but that is quickly overpowered by the big pine, citrus flavor from the hops. The malt is in the background and there are some flowery notes in the taste due to the hops. The finish is nice and spicy bitter. I thought the mouthfeel was a little thinner than some of the Double IPAs I've had recently, it was about right. Great drinkability, I really enjoyed the flavor."
"Color is a nice golden orange color with a solid white head and good belgian lacing. Aroma of grassy hops with a little bit of malt background. Full bodied and chewy, good CO2. Pretty well balanced for sucha big beer, not too sweet and a hop monster flavor with balanced bitterness. Easy to get yourself hurt drinking this one."
"There is something unique about the hop profile in this IPA. Perhaps this is due to the Nugget hops, which I don't remember any other IPA I've tried having. Anyway, not my favorite but worth trying."
"D- Smooth, smells great and tasts great. Just a tad to bitter though however this is a great DIPA."
"D: Fantastic stuff. Straight out of Heather's food fridge, this was far too cold. As it warmed this absolutely came alive. Do not serve too cold!"
"Drinkability: Session or Sipper Whatever you can handle! I was amazed with the flavors in this Double IPA. A friend had it in his fridge and we tried it - I'm excited to taste more beer from Green Flash."
"Just a fantastic DIPA. True west coast style. Thanks again!"
"Note: This beer is better than my score indicates, it really is fabulous!"
"This is a beer the average hop head should thoroughly enjoy. However, the high ABV and super bitterness will limit the volume consumed. This is a true San Diego style IIPA. My taste buds were shot after two pints."
"The first sip you see how powerful hoppy this one is. As it warms it becomes a tad bit smoother but is still pretty aggressive and a tad abrasive. Overall I liked it and would buy it again but I still would prefer the pliny."
"D - very nice, I wish I picked up another bomber or two."
"Overall impression: Typical American DIPA, but good flavors and plenty drinkable - this is a nice example of the style (as you would expect from San Diego)."
"Drinkability: A beer that had incredible promise, but just ended up being way too much. It looks and smells wonderful, but the taste leaves much to be desired. The alcohol isn’t hidden at all, making it tough to do anything but sip. I'll have to try this again sometime, but right now its not for me."
"poured from a bomber into a 20oz pint glass. pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a thin white head. aroma is hoppy with citrus and pine. taste is crisp and refreshing with hop and grapefruit present. has a slight bitter aftertaste, but this beer is drinkable, and could drink all night long."
"D- also great not boozy at all goes down real smooth i could have a few of these"
"This beer was just as i expected it to be, extremely hoppy with a great malt backing to balance the taste and leave with a great aftertaste. The alcohol level was well hidden with the west coast hoppy goodness packed in. I really enjoyed this beer and hope to have it again soon. Once again, a great beer produced by Green Flash brewers!"
"In direct comparison to a no more than 2 month old hopslam, this beer has no hops flavor. Tastes more like a Belgian IPA at this point as opposed to an American. I've yet to drink a fresh bottle of this, but after reading some other reviews, I'm confident aging this one has a significant effect."
"Overall this brew is tasty to the last drop and I won't hesitate to buy 2 more the next time I see it."
"I would definately recommend this to anyone who is a fan of IPA's plan on getting this one again because of the great balance and mouthfeel"
"D: Very drinkable. One of my favorite IIPAs."
"Ultimately, this is quickly becoming my favorite IIPA. Third time I'm having Green Flash IIPA, and it hasn't disappointed me yet. No other IIPA I've had has a bouquet that's so fresh and inviting. The IBU's don't seem noticeable at all, and this is THE beer that I'm thankful comes in bombers and not sixers; I can easily see myself downing three or four of these before I realize I'm out for the count."
"Beer poured into a Paulaner Wesbier glass. A clean white 2 finger head forms and holds nicely for more than a few sips. Beer is a translucent golden yellow color. Smell is pure hops with some citrus. If you like hops, you'll love the smell of this one. Taste is excellent; surprisingly, malts come through up-front and then the primary taste is well balanced off with the hops. The finish is hops as you would expect, but you can still taste the malts. Beer is light on the palate and the ample carbonation helps the beer dance across the toungue. I enjoyed this beer tremendously."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Thanks goes out to alexd3891 for this awesome extra! Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a small off-white head that left some surprisingly nice lacing for such a high ABV. Aroma is piney with hints of orange-like citrus. There is also a huge peppery and herbal like spiciness to the nose which is quite different but nice. Taste is nice and bitter, plenty of grapefruit and pine resin, a solid cracker-like malt backbone, and again with peppery spiciness and herbal notes that were in the aroma. Sweet at first, dry and puckering on the finish. Medium body, good carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, different than many DIPAs I've come across."
"Drinkability: This is very drinkable for a beer with such a high ABV but it was difficult to finish an entire bomber without wanting to switch back and forth with something with less hops intensity as I usually do when drinking 100+ IBU DIPA's."
"Pours a clear honey-red colored body, with a frothy white head, good lacing and lasting. Has a grapefruity, bitter aroma. A hoppy bitter taste, real bitter, and dry. Like sticking your face in horsefeed. Rougher as it warms up."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with a alcohol, zippy carbonation."
"I'm not really sure why I've never searched out this beer before but I'm glad I got the chance to try it. It's a damn fine IIPA that I'd like to see on the shelves around these parts. Thanks for the bottle and another great trade Justin!"
"Verdict: Drink it fresh, drink it often."
"Pretty drinkable for an Imperial beer and an enjoyable one at that. Not much different from any respectable IIPA but good nontheless."
"this is a typical californian imperial IPA. pours that deep straw/gold with a moderate head and some lcae, but not much. smells strongly of hops. tastes of hops and has an almost airy quality to it. this is a solid example of what this beer should taste like."
"Drinkability - What a good ipa this is. Easily drinkable and exactly what you would expect from a San Diego brewed Double ipa. Solid in so many areas, just not great enough to be considered elite. There is nothing wrong with that, as I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
"Overall this is about as solid of an Imperial IPA as you can get. If you have the means i suggest giving it a go. This one will not disappoint you."
"Pours a transparent amber orange color with lots of carbonation supporting a medium sized rocky white head that leaves lots of sticking. Peaches, apricot, pineapple and subtle citrus fruit in the nose, fresh and grassy almost in character. The aroma is balanced with a strong underlying malty sweetness. Big hop flavor, fruit flesh, this is the juiciest DIPA ive come across. The herbal, cannabis like hop character really stays with you long after the sip. Just enough alcohol presence to keep things interesting, just drying enough to let the beauty of the hop really shine. Wonderful medium body, low/moderate carbonation feel, and IMO, very quaffable. Hop heads, have at it."
"Wow. This is a serious IPA that, while dominated by the hops, is tasty and extremely drinkable. This is what DIPA's is all about."
"The aroma is very citrusy and piny with caramel malt and bread. The appearance is golden amber with a large head for the style. The flavor is like the aroma, simple but good. The palate is smooth. Overall it's very good and I look forward to another one."
"This was nicer at the beginning than the end of the bottle."
"D: A very nice drinkable DIPA that I will be having again for sure!"
"Green Flash is an excellent brewer and this is one of their better beers. The hops are well masked for an IPA but the flavor is intense and fulfilling. I would also recommend their barleywine."
"Well, what is there to say. If you like rather simple beers which taste mainly of hops, then this is one which should please you."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle... A nice medium orange color with a nice head and lacing. The smell of this ale screams West Coast...nice hop aroma with a faint fruit scent. A very balanced DIPA, with the malt to hop combo around 50/50...IMO. A very crisp grassy flavor is followed by a nice caramel malt after taste. A very easy to drink double from West Coast, and definitely worth trying over and over again"
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, very satisfying. Pretty drinkable, but you'll know you've just had a big fat DIPA. This one will probably creep up on me, but damn it's tasty. Thanks to Sparky27 for sharing."
"D: Not as high as others in the style. The earthy hop characteristic, is unique, but its a little off, I'd really prefer a bit more citrus/pine. Still good. Alcohol is somewhat hidden, and dangerous. Really just too huge and palate wrecking to consume more than one bomber. Would like to try really fresh."
"D- I could drink a couple of these and would like to do a side by side with Weyerbacher's Dbl Simcoe"
"M/D: Medium carbonation...right on for the style. Alcohol hits hard, but the beer has a ton of character, and the crisp clean hop flavor gives the beer a great enjoyment factor."
"Breathtaking looks of rusty golden coloring sporting a mountainous creamy head that subsides after a few minutes into a frothy one-finger plateau. Good retention as well. Engaging aroma of wet hop gardens with spotted clementine notes and sweet cream. The taste catches me a little off guard: pine, earth, wet hops, damp bitterness to finish and a medicinal alcohol aftertaste that lingers. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with almost no carbonation. A powerful BIG IPA that surrounds and swallows up the palate like the ocean around a lifeboat."
"A gorgeous, pillowy rocky surface head sits tight atop an orangey amber, murky body. Appears thick. Strong aroma of honey dew, green grapes and fruit. Aromas of carmel, custard, and amber syrup jump up as it warms. Taste is complex. Oily wood, resin, and spice lead into booze. A winey apricot emerges between heavy draped lacing. Tad bit piney, and at times reminiscent of sap and saw dust; a slight chew. The 9% is open and boasting. An great addition to the world of DIPA's; marching a bit off beat in the best way possible."
"I would agree with some other posters. You certainly have to enjoy hops to like this beer. I have to say, I haven't met a green flash beer that I have not liked. They have another winner here if your a hop head. I would recommend it and I look fwd to drinking it again."
"Great for experienced hopheads and I would not suggest this is a session beer."
"I pored this beer from a 22oz bottle no freshness date in to a pint glass. The Head on this beer is white, foamy almost frothy, with good retention. The body is coppery amber in color and crystal clear probably the clearest beer I have drank besides DFH 90. Excellent lacing this beer is great to look at. The smell is hops and sweet malt as soon as you breathe it in. I find some fruity and citrus in there as well. Wow the taste is hoppy 101 IBU's, tart and sweet malt flavor just like it smells. The mouth feel is medium and crisp with Grapefruit flavor in there with a bitter bite. Hops and malts balance this beer out so the high 9% ABV is almost unnoticeable, until it gets to room temp then watch out the alcohol flavors start oozing out. If you like hoppy your going to enjoy this beer Green Flash never disappoints."
"D: Make a call for delivery for dinner and throw your keys behind the couch... this is way drinkable, especially for any hophead. If you want a potent one-beer nightcap, this is a great candidate."
"Green Flash Imperial India Pale Ale is a very clear, quite sparkling, lighter amber ale. The head is frothy, fluffy and yellowish off-white with excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is of grass, hay and lemon. It is medium-full bodied, very smooth and frothy with a clean, delicate finish. It is not over-the-top or overwhelming. It is very well balanced. It is bready and grassy with a note of hay. There isn't really any sweetness or juiciness. It's savory. A well done Imperial IPA."
"Poured into a glass, pours a golden color with a fluffy head that leaves some nice lace on the glass. Smell is very pine and citrus with a nice honey type smell to this. The taste is I thought was a bit different. I was expecting a nice hop bomb but this was a bit subtle the malt was up front with the piney hop finish. The hops on my palate lasted quite a bit of time. I was expecting this to be up front with the hops but it wasn't, overall a very easy drinker and a decent offering."
"Very good DIPA, and quite a bit different in hop profile than Pure Hoppiness or Pliny the Elder. I think it relates a little closer to Ruination."
"Notes: A no nonsense,complex brew full of awesome hops and grapefruit. What a bitterness that lingered on my tongue and pounced on my palate."
"Drinkability is great man wish my local store would get this in the do carry other Green Flash brew time to chat with owner again. Buy this one relatively cheap compared to others and just as damn tasty as all but the very, very best."
"HV"
"overall drinkability is pretty high, considering the relatively low price. the bitterness is not too intense considering the 101 IBU's, there is enough malts to lend a little balance. the alcohol is also very well hidden, it drinks almost like a regular IPA."
"A very fine Imperial IPA that will please anyone who loves hops."
"Pick this one up and enjoy..."
"d: Could drink this one all day.. And night.. Another great offering from Green Flash.."
"D: Certainly delivers what it promises as an Imperial IPA. I've found this more drinkable than similar IPAs with a claimed IBU of ~100, but the overall flavor profile don't seem as nuanced as one might like. This is the first offering I've sampled from Green Flash, and while I'm not planning to come back to this Imperial IPA right away, I'll definitely pick up their West Coast IPA to see how it compares."
"I really enjoyed this Imperial IPA from Green Flash. A - deep yellow color with small foamy head; appears unfiltered and is translucent. S -strong hop smell with a hint of sweetness and apricot; the hop smell is heavenly. T - very smooth for 9% ABV; is bitter at first, but this quickly disappears on the finish."
"and - the second glass threw up an incredible 3 finger head that settled into a meringue-like consistency - pretty amazing"
"Hazy glow to the amber red to pumpkin orange color, even through the gauziness you can see the bubbles lifting into the cream colored, thick head which stays past closing time. Sweet, fruity nose of apricot, peach, pear fruit as well as tangerine juice, pine needles, brioche and a bundle of meadow grasses and flowers, attractive fullness while retaining clarity of elements, Full-bodied, spicy, citrusy attack with cumin, garlic flavors next to orange, white grapefruit notes. The carbonation shows verve to break through the overall density and oily texture. While certainly hoppy, not bitter, no pucker, more like an exfoliation. Pine, tar resin, fresh milk, coffee grinds, wax, enjoyable for its ability to change sip to sip. Anvil sits on your tongue long after you've swallowed."
"D - A bit intense for a high level of drinkability. I've cracked myself open a bomber for solo consumption and I'm already having second thoughts. Maybe some more malt character and a touch more """crispness""" could help this out."
"Definitely a hop monster IIPA from Green Flash. I think I need to find a few more of these."
"6/4/4/2/10 (2.6/5)"
"Awesome mouthfeel and I cant picture another DIPA with better drinkability. A top notch DIPA that should be enjoyed fresh. Just wonderful."
"This comes in 22oz bomber bottles, and it's a whopping 9% ABV. I buy these any time I see them and they are a real treat for people like me that love hops. At 22oz and 9%, you're probably going to be set up just fine with one, heh. But it's so flavorful, you can drink it slow and make it last."
"but i will definitely pick up some more and try other green flash offerings!"
" I've become a big fan of Green Flash, given every one I've had has been pretty decent."
"If you are an intense hophead that doesn't want to taste malt at all, then this is a good one for you. I liked it for what it was, but since I prefer a bit more balance, I might pass on my next opportunity to buy this one."
"Pours a vibrant golden orange with a 1 finger head. Retention is pretty good and the minimal lacing is scattered. It was a pretty bad pour. The aroma is of grapefruit and other citrus, with some pine. There is no malt aroma to speak of. The taste is very citrusy. Mostly delicious bitter grapefruit. There is a high level of hop bitterness and the alcohol is well hidden. Where is the malt? Oh, I nearly forgot, this is a San Diego Pale Ale. I love the flavor. Finish is dry and very bitter. The beer is nicely carbonated. It's medium bodied, dry, and has a sticky mouthfeel. I could drink quite a few of these."
"D: Not the best DIPA, but without a doubt, it's a good one if you're a hop head or if your palate has been misbehaving and punishment is due."
"Extremely hopped beer, prominently featuring the Nugget which might just be my favorite hop. Smells great with the typical pine and citrus aromas, but unlike many IPAs the base fruit taste is orange instead of grapefruit. A very unique and delicious brew."
"D - I could drink many of these beers - but wouldn't savor them. Nothing really significantly stands out on this beer. That is, picking out individual flavors is difficult. In my opinion, a fairly simplistic beer, but defiantly drinkable."
"Sample at Oggi's Mission Valley location. This beer pours a mostly clear yellow-gold color with a medium thin off-white head that diminishes slowly. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Citrus and hops aroma with a hint of spice. Medium-bodied with flavors of piney hops and spice, plus some grapefruit. Very little malt is present for balance. The finish is slightly astringent hops and citrus with a lingering hops aftertaste. Above average, and would be much better if it were more balanced."
"D: Not too bad a great DIPA.I don't know whether to blame the batch to batch variation on the distributor (which is more likely) or the brewer. When you get a good bottle it is great."
"Pours orange with a foamy head, good lacing. Smells piney and citrusy, mainly grapefruit, with plenty of hops. Flavor was thick and hoppy, sweet of grapefruit, malty and slightly boozy. Certainly not a bad beer, especially for the price, I just prefer their west coast IPA more."
"Hand-delivered to Vienna from the U.S. (thanks, Chris and Jeff!), the bomber looks just like the picture here. It pours a vaguely cloudy copper-gold under a one figure off-white head that settles slowly but steadily to film and collar, leaving a bit of lace on the side. The nose is strong of pine and carnation - very enticing, if perhaps a touch one-sided. The mouth is mildly carbonated and quite heavy, almost but not quite sticky. The flavor is strong, with coniferal hops everywhere. Some sweet malt, almost caramel, is ever present, but never above the surface, only cutting a bit of the edge off the hops. The bitter is achingly dry, like eating a pine cone - delicious, really. The alcohol is barely discernible, as the hops dominate everything all the way through to the dry, pine sap aftertaste. I have only one bottle, but wish I had more, as I'd be happy to keep drinking this. This brew is a perfect example of what I miss most about being in the States."
"D- If you like hops, its an easy drinker. If you like your hops somewhat subdued, then don't pick up this one. Awesome beer and one that is of great quality."
"Poured a nice copper orange with nice fizzy head. Nose is floral hop aroma, some biscuity malts. Nice bitterness, but its all too much in the end. Malts are very heavy. A very toasted and caramel mats flavor, more than hops it seems. Smooth and dry finish. I thought the bottle was more hopfroward. On tap was pretty harsh! Wont drink again."
"Can't go wrong with Green Flash. Thanks Brewers! THe Lord bless the hop harvest."
"I love this beer, one of the best imperial IPAs i've ever had. Balance is near perfect, the aroma is just plain unreal. I must've gotten a very fresh bottle. Alcohol is very well hidden so i must be careful when i drink this. Highly recommend for those hop heads and i can't wait to try this again."
"I poured from a bomber into a tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy orange with a monstrous head. The head leaves clingy white lace all over the glass. IMO the smell is some what muted. There are definite pine notes, but less than what I expect with over 100 IBU's. The taste is also muted. The piney taste is there but it is not upfront, and there is not much else going on. This beer is full bodied and almost chewey. A sipper, not because of the hefty ABV, just a heavy beer. A definite dissapointment I will not buy again."
"Good IIPA, but I enjoyed the Green Flash IPA more than this one."
"Flavors are more hoppy than in the nose. I get more of the grassy hops in the taste, but there is still plenty of tangy grapefruit flavors here. Seems to have a different hoppy flavor than the WCIPA, but nonetheless tasty in it's own right. I taste hints of honey, green grapes and warming alcohol. A good beer. Period. Will buy again, and urge all hopheads out there to try it."
"Smells pleasantly fruity and citric to balance out the hop assault on my nostrils. Pours a bit paler than some 2IPAs, with a big, beautiful frothy head and one of the longest lasting, soapiest lacings I've ever seen for an India pale ale. This beer looks excellent. Flavor is a bit citric in order to combat the excessive hop bitterness, but still doesn't feel as balanced as the better 2IPAs I've had such as DFH90 or Lagunitas Maximus. Definitely worth trying but the best part about this beer is the look about it."
"I really liked this one. Good representative of the west coast IIPA. I agree with DA, the hops in this beer taste fresh and clean, giving it a different character than most IIPA's. Powerful taste, but not an overly bitter bite. Has hints of sweetness, like a pink grapefruit. Good balance and smooth taste throughout. Finish is resiny but not sticky. Very nice."
"If you're looking for a hop bomb, that's nicely balanced, seek this one out. One of my go to IIPAs. Yep."
"Balanced and complex, yet with oodles of hops to please even the most demanding hop-head. This is seriously good. In my book, Green Flash is now up there with Bell's, Hair of the Dog and Stone in terms of delivering big flavor consistently, no matter what style they tackle. Hail."
"Overall this beer ranks up there with the best DIPAs I have ever had. Amazing. Green Flash is kicking ass and I couldn't be happier. This is one very different but very awesome beer. Buy it, drink it and enjoy. Dear Santa: Bring me some Green Flash IIPA please...Thanks!"
"Pretty strong in the alcohol dept. Goes real well with spicy food. I might have this again. Not what I was expecting from a west coast IPA. Comparing it to Stone's Ruination; they are world's apart. Both good. This one might grow on me..."
"D: This was a serious brew and not bad, but I've had better DIPA's. Again, the lack of balance dropped this one, if the malt could've been more prominent, it might've been better. Decent start for Green Flash, I'll definetly try more of their higher rated brews. Try this if you're crazy for HOPS, else don't go out of your way."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and this one is pretty dry, I love this beer but the dryness burns my palate a little too much so not much more than the bomber for me."
"(You must have been 18+ to have been allowed to read this review)"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and biting."
"D - I don't think I would want too many. Even one was enough. It is just a huge hop beer, straight up, so much punch and clarity, but at 9% it is a little bit too much to kick back on. I really appreciated it for it's straightforward commitment to what it is, but it is a beer to marvel at once in a night; have your friends take a sip to experience it, finish the rest, and move on to something else. You will surely remember it in the morning."
"Overall, a very appetizing brew that didn't hit me over the head with hops like some DIPAs. I could definitely have some more."
"Incredibly drinkable. Awesome hop bomb that went very well with the pizza I ordered. Be sure and drink this one fresh!"
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced Imperial IPA with unique flavors and aromas. Definitely feel the gravity. A refreshing bracer after a hard day working in the yard."
"For me, drinkability is somewhat poor even considering that this is a sipping beer @ 9%. As mentioned before I could not have finished this beer alone. Sorry GF, this one really didn't do it for me. Guess I'll go back to the East coast next time I want a double IPA."
"D: With such a high alcohol content, it's tough to resist over-drinking."
" The 9.0% ABV is easily felt here but I didn't think that it detracted from the beer or its taste. Instead, it enhanced a very light and strong flavor. It may sound like that those two adjectives aren't compatible, but give this shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised like I was!"
"Drinkability - the medicinal taste I could do without, but this beer has lots to enjoy, especially during these hop-challenged times. Thanks to BGThang for sending me a bomber of this. He da' man..."
"D: I could use a little more balance, but the pint was poured extremely cold and with each sip some of the caramel notes started to come through."
"Green Flash has character and has not disappointed me yet...Excellent Thank you GF Brewery...one of these days I'll make it out to Calli."
"If your idea of a good beer is sucking a hop pellet then this is one for you. I'm a hop head, but I prefer a little balance."
"D: I could drink this all day"
"Count the NCBEERMONGER as a huge fan of this imperial IPA"
"D- I couldn't finish it. There was nothing I really liked about the flavor. The pine was not very pleasant and the alcohol was too noticeable. Usually piney IPAs are a good thing (ie Pliny the Elder) however there was not enough to balance it."
"D - Not bad, but for a double IPA I like more of a hop kick. I want to move on after a bomber."
"The mouthfeel is great, if not perfect. It's a very smooth beer with tiny bubbles tickling the edges of your tongue but refraining from any prickliness. The drinkability is good for a high abv, high ibu beer. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, a spectacular beer....i was not disappointed :)"
"This was a pleasure to drink and wish I had the whole bottle myself. I cruised through my half."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable for such a high ABV (9%). I will only need one though. This is a great drinking beer, or a great beer to sip and enjoy. This is my first beer from Green Flash, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look for more."
"Very enjoyable to drink but the lack of intense hop heat and bitterness (and the lack of a freshness date) make me wonder if perhaps this bottle is a bit old? It actually tastes more like a strong IPA than an Imperial IPA. Not a hophead's holy grail but still a tasty and easy to drink beer."
"D - Good IPA. Was extremely excited to trade for and then receive in a BIF. Only wish I had acquired more."
"bomber split with the landlord...probably wouldn't buy this myself, but I'm glad to have tried it"
"D: Drinkable, but not the best Imperial IPA that I've had."
"Murky pale amber/orange with a fairly thick head. Nice balanced smell that leans heavily towards the hops without being a hop bomb. Good flavour, the hops are very distinc and the malt tames them just enough that this doesn't become one dimensional. Carbonation is a little bit light and the high ABV make this one to savour."
"On tap at Papago Brewing, the color is a hazy yellow. Smells strongly of citrus, and tastes of bitter bitter citrus. A little too much bitterness and a tad less citrus flavor than I prefer; a little out of balance. A strong bitter aspirin aftertaste. Not the greatest San Diego IIPA, but a strong entry nonetheless."
"M + D: Medium body, assertive carbonation, which continues all the way down, giving it quite a sparkle. A little bit of alcohol warming right at the back of the throat and on the way down. With that bigger alcohol content, it's more suitable for easy going drinking, but that's alright... not one of my favourites, but a solid DIPA."
"A hell of a feat, the hops and hot alcohol overwhelm just a bit, but very very good."
"The body of the beer is drinkable, but substantial enough to let you know it's got some testicular fortitude. It's not thin by any means, yet it's not too viscious. Perfect. The bitterness BUs are really high, but this is a showcase for hop flavor/aroma. The finish leaves you wanting more. I wish I'd bought more. It almost makes me want to move to San Diego. Almost. This is a five star Imperial/Double Ipa if ever I've tried one. And I make beer for a living."
"D - Very nice West Coast IPA that actually exceeded my expectations. I haven't had many Green Flash offerings, but if all of their stuff is this good, then sign me up for more!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and rather viscous for a DIPA. Alcohol is well masked. And the bitterness is not totally overwhelming making the beer rather drinkable."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber with a 1 fingered head and lacing. The initial smell was of strong citrus hops but that went away rapidly, when the beer mellowed the smell changed to a piney hop with malty overtones. This beer is strange for DIPA, very malty and not so hoppy. I always like my dipa's overly hopped, this seems overly malted, BUT it is a very nice flavor. it more reminds me of a malty IPA with a high alcohol %. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a slight dry aftertaste. A nice brew I am sure I could drink a couple of these."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite DIPA. Alcohol's up there and all, and though it's largely well-hidden, the flavors and aromas just aren't terribly interesting or unique. Worth trying once - maybe it's your thing - but I likely won't be picking this one up again."
"cheers."
"D: Very refreshing, goes down easy, but gets you drunk quickly. I'm going to be pretty loopy after this 1pt. 6oz. bottle."
"I have had this in bottle before and, while I liked it, I was originally going to pass this over in the midst of the incredibly impressive offerings at Beechwood. I had even recomended it to a friend, who I know was a hop freak. Then came the word that the hop element taseted like weed. Of course, i get the natuaral comparison between hops and weed, but I did not realize how literal it was in this tap, until I actually tased some. Inevitably this lead to my own pint to close the night. Over all, another winner from Green Flash. If you had this in bottle, still take the tim eto get this on tap and get the whole Chech and Chong hop effect."
"Pours fairly clear with a gloden amber hue and a large white head that decays over time to a rocky terrain in my snifter. Aroma is nice, sweet, never really smelled this nice blend of Summit and Nugget before, resiny but not piney. Flavor is sweet and bitter but not overdone. Leaves a slightly bitter taste in your mouth but not overdone. Solid"
"The golden ale kissed with garnet highlights releases a complex and masterful aroma of spruce, pineapple, cannabis, green grapes, and onions. The hop flavor on this beer is magnificent and somewhat unbalanced - in that the flavor lends intensity to the bitterness with a malt background screaming for attention. Pure freshness and with masterful complexity where it counts. Crisp edges and medium carbonation gives a dry yet smooth mouthfeel. At 101 IBUs I was expecting a bit more flavor bitterness throughout the finish but the aroma flags abrupt caution."
"D: This is decently drinkable. It would be a stretch to go over 1 bomber in an evening for me. Still throughly enjoyed it because there was some hops bitterness but it wasn't stupid. It was balanced to a point. Very nice indeed."
"Bottom line: This beer has little if any resemblance to it's former self. And that really pisses me off. If you can't make the same beer with the same ingredients, then at least call it something else."
"I had the standard Green Flash IPA right before and enjoyed it more."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Rich copper color with a silky tan head. The nose a nice hop profile balanced by some sweet malts. The taste is also quite nice. Citrusy and floral hops up front followed by some bready malt varieties. Mouthfeel is full and perfectly carbonated. A very nice Double IPA."
"pours a dark orange syrup sunset colour ... great foam ... lacing is ample and creamy ... has a very clean hop bite ... with a nice after hop lacquer ... very upfront ...''book of the dead'' ... you can taste and feel the 101 IBU's ... system check : lots of sticky pine needles left in the mouth, big tasty shoulder shuddering (msCoop) ..."
"D - A decent brew, fairly easy to drink. Not anything too impressive or mind blowing, but worth getting at least once."
"Poured out of my bomber a hazy, sunset orange with a tan head of medium sized bubbles about two fingers deep. Thin bands of off-white lace clung to the glass. Strong hop aroma dominates the nose, floral, citrus and pine leaving not much of anything else to be detected! The first flavors are a shock of bitter and tart hops, fresh hops, grapefruit and lemon. A cookie-like malt provides balance and really helps the brew become more drinkable as it warms. The sharp hoppy character hides the high ALC% and also serves to clear the palate at the end leaving a long, green finish. Medium carbonation. A very big beer and a quaffable one but I would still recommend it primarily for hop heads."
"This is a primo example of a west-coast, sharp IPA. Don't even go near this one unless you're fiending for some hoppy time."
"Mid gold with that orange tinge and a huge head. The nose is huge and grapefruity with a big citrus backnote. The hops clear out the motuh but there is a smoothness that coats the palate. This is a big beer but one that pulls it together in the finish. A real nice DIPA that tastes big and hoppy but drinks smooth."
"Drinkability: Excellent IIPA. Very drinkable for this big of a beer."
"D: Quite drinkable for an IIPA, but slightly more flavor up front would make this even better."
"D:Very good. As hoppy as this beer is, it is fantastically balanced through out. The blast of pine hops smoothes out in to the malty wheatyness. Very good."
"Green Flash did a pretty good with this DIPA. It's an unusual crafting for the style. The hop flavor easily qualifies it for that status. While I'm not enamored with it, it is a pretty good beer. I'd just prefer a little more citrus and pine in my hops. That's not too much to ask, is it?"
"D: A unique DIPA that goes against the grain for most West Coast IPAs -- a minimal floral, fruity quality and more of the woody, herbal side. An open mind and this beer will mix well together."
"Another great beer for the hops lovers. Even though the hops tip the flavor balance it still remains very drinkable. Have to be careful with this one because of it's high alcohol content. I would definitely recommend it to others. This is my second Green Flash beer and I must say both have been amazing. I look forward to more from this brewery."
"If you're into really hoppy and bitter IPAs, this might be for you."
"D- very solid and balanced imperial IPA, nothing outstanding but so good. recommended"
"Pours a very nice cloudy golden orange color, very nice carbonation, very nice thick creamy off-white one-finger head, with a very nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, sweet, very nice blend of malts, citrus, and pines. The taste is a hop bomb, slightly malty, nice touch of citrus and pines. Also, a nice chewiness to this brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice DIPA, recommended for sure."
"Hazy apricot pour, with a big white head, that leaves lacing from top to bottom. Big hop smell with citrus hints. Looks like I can't wait to taste it. Hops are up front with a definite grapefruit citrus finish. Little malt back up but somehow I really like it. Has a nice thick mouth feel with little carbonation. Very easy drinker, good thing I only have one, because I would have drunk more, and I'm a little tipsy now. Thanks goes out to longbeachhophead for this extra big treat!"
"it's okay, but i had higher expectations."
"D - To hoppy for me to enjoy on a regular basis"
"It pours a wonderful golden hue with a huge billowing three fingered head on it. This had great head retention until almost my last sip, and left decent spotty lacing on my pint glass. The nose is no surprise for a San Diego style DIPA. It has loads of fresh citrus fruit leaning towards mostly grapefruit with pine and a certain earthiness that comes through, but not with much potency, and I think that works well for this offering. This is a very pleasing nose to this hop-head. The flavor profile almost does a 180 though. The pine and earthiness that was more muted in the nose comes out full force upon first sip with plenty of bitterness and pine needles. The citrus flavor comes in about mid-drink with plenty of grapefruit and tropical fruit into the finish. The malt tried to come in, but just didn't have the power to get over the hops. The mouthfeel is bordering on full bodied with low carbonation, and the warming alcohol is quite well hidden. The drinkability is also very good on this beer for one bomber, and I would most likely split this with someone if I had another bottle of it."
"D: It's a 9% DIPA... but it tastes so damn good. I have to take off a little bit but not too much. Damn good DIPA."
"Pours out an average golden color but with an extraordinary head, which is what bumps up the appearance score. From the moment I had popped open the bottle, hops hit my nose and the presence of the hosp only got stronger the closer I got to the beer, obviously. It's a pure, fresh hop aroma, like there are hops floating on top of the beer; wonderful! Some malt comes though as well. The taste is also heavily of fresh hops, but the hops are more earthy and woody than citric...a very nice quality. Again, very fresh tasting. The bitterness is rounded out by the big malt bill. This is an incredible IPA...well balanced AND able to quench that intense hop fix."
"EDIT - I drank it again today (November 2nd, 2014) and it tastes exactly the same.  Kudos to Green Flash for quality control and consistency, anyway."
"Some warming from the alcohol. Good body and carbonation. Well made."
"D-Strong alcohol takes away and the off flavor as it warms would not keep me coming back"
"Poured into a pint glass. Beautiful bright orange hue; completely unfiltered. Nice white creamy head, lacing the entire session. Reminds me of an orange cream sicile. The aroma is not overpowering, but the floral hops come through. The taste is fruity sweet, then the bitterness hits the back of your tongue. There is a buttery smoothness that make the body just slide down your throat. The body is full, but not too heavy, this is a sipper. The alcohol is well hidden and this is one I will try any chance I get."
"drinkabilitly is awesome considering the abv and ibu's give maharajah a run for its money and then some"
"This is a very impressive Imperial IPA for sure, and I'd definitely seek it out again. As most reviewers seem to agree, the west coast hoppiness is good, and not overdone. Seems just right to me. The alcohol isn't all that detectable for it's 9%, and you will feel it. There is balance in the malts too. I think I have to give this an A at least AND, I'd suggest this is the PERFECT beer to go with some spicy buffalo wings! Bring'em!"
"Not too hoppy, but hoppy enough to be enjoyable, as it proves to be quite understated for such a high ABV."
"On tap at The Pacific Beach Tap Room. Dark golden color with an average white head. Grapefruit, spice and wood in the nose. Flavor is moderately bitter with biscuity malts. A silky mouthfeel. This beer drinks really easy for 9%. Green Flash impresses me again."
"Nice light orange with large slightly off white head that left decent lacing. Nose full of citrus, grapefruit/pineapple and orange rind. Some carmallized malts and a wiff of alcohol with some lingering pine. Surprisingly well malted for 101 ibu's. Supremely bitter throughout especially on the finish. The alcohol warmth hits the face but the flavor is well guarded, and although the bitterness rules the day some overripe pineapple and grapefruit flavors do come through. Good mouth feel that coats the tongue nicely. For all the bitterness this is still fairly drinkable, although all of the promise in the nose is not quite fullfilled in ghe taste because of the overriding bitterness."
"D- A very solid DIPA. Easy to drink this one could sneak up on you fast."
"Pours a light orange with pretty good clarity. Two finger head with moderate white lacing. Nose- most spicy hops I've had the pleasure of smelling. Herbal, pine, very pungent. Taste- caramel sweetness quickly offset by citric bitterness that follows through to the finish. Grapefruit and high alpha acide good times here. Carbonation is moderate and no booze is detected. Likely masked by overwhelming bitterness. Mouth drys out quickly with worth every drop."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with 3 cm of foamy off-white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of bitter and sweet citrus hops. Initial flavor is sweet, but quickly turns overly hoppy and spicy. Medium body, moderate lacing, light carbonation, and some alcohol presence. Overall, decent imperial ipa, had better but worth a try."
"Gets a little astringent as it warms. Still very nice. Don't let this beer warm up too much."
"Taste is more of the grapefruit and pineapple sweetness at first followed by a tongue drying (and lashing) by the massive amount of West Coast hops and the high ABV. Its a very bitter IPA that is definitely leaning towards being a one-sided hop monster, but hell if you're a hop head this is your kind of beer! Did I mention it cracks the century mark when it comes to IBUs? I love it for what it is..."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with a bit of a reddish hue. Nice sized head. Lacing on the surface the whole way down the glass. Aroma is all big citrusy hops. Sweet grapefruit and lemons. Citrus and herbal hops are balanced by tons of sweet malt. Honey. Nice bitter finish- although this again is tempered by the malt. Medium to full bodied. A pretty tasty and drinkable DIPA."
"I really wanted to love it... But No."
"Overall a nice IPA I'll pick up when I see it."
"Poured a rich copper color with a very nice white foamy, somewhat sudsy head that slowly died down to leave lacing stuck to the side of the glass. Aroma is heavy on some sweet malt, and plenty of pine and grapefruit. Not a great amount of carbonation on this one, and I sipped this as it coated my tastebuds."
"This beer poured a clear copper color and formed a nice huge snowy white foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, pine and grapefruit. The flavor was of hops, grapefruit, pepper and a hint of caramel sweetnesss. The body is medium light and slightly creamy with the finish astrigent with some peppery bitterness."
"The hazy golden amber color is lighter than most that I've experienced of this style. An aggressive pour yields way more than a full finger foamy light orange tinted head that resists fading. It leaves impressive sheets of Belgian lacing in its wake. The smell is aggressive and primarily piny grapefruit over a sweet bubble gum malty character. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is compellingly hoppy. A HUGE amount of quality ingredients were sacrificed to bring you this top shelf product. This is clearly a celebration of hops! The tangy hop resin texture of the mouth lingers on and on and on...which I personally find """over-the-top""" and 'way above' the """standard""" for this style. Full flavored, the grapefruit hop taste is EXTREME. The 9% ABV sneaks in beneath the HOP BOMB. Beware...this beverage will get your attention. I highly recommend this one to anyone...and oh by the way, feel free to stray beyond the box and celebrate the creativity and imagination contained there in. The folks at Green Flash """are bringing it""". GO GET SOME!!"
"Drinkability: I was caught off guard and bodyslammed by hops when I took the first sip! It was really quite exciting, but overall, it was a little too over the top to be considered a nightly sessionable beer. I'll drink one, then need to change gears in a single drinking night. I know, I know this is a IIPA, but wow, I expect some malts to take down the bitter, hop rage. If you want a SOLID hopbomb, this is the one for you!!! Go West Coast, with your BIG IIPA's!"
"Poured this 22oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. It poured a deep amber orange with a 2 finger head that left significant lacing on the glass. The aroma is a hop smack in the face. The aroma is mainly piney hops but hints of grapefruit and lemon come through. Also the malty sweetness comes through at the very finish and its kind of blended with an alcoholy kick. The taste is big on hops, of course. Pine, grapefruit, slight bit of grass and sweet melons come through. It's really the whole hop gamut on this one, and the best thing is all the flavors are melded together, they are all pretty distinct. The sweet malt backbone really helps balance the beer very well. The mouthfeel is full and coats the mouth with a hoppy goodness. While it's over the top hoppy it is balanced and makes for an awesome DIPA."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. However I would warn people looking for a maltier or more complex IIPA that this is definitely more fresh hop oriented."
"bottle. Amber colored and very bubbly. has a thick frothy head that maintains itself quite well. smells citrusy, rich, and sweet like candy. very richly hoppy. not as citrusy or floral in taste as in smell, but it tastes like you are chewing on the hops themselves. has a combination of sweet and bitter that may be like grapefruit with sugar on top. well-balanced to rich toasty malts. could be the definition of IIPA."
"This one will really sneak up on you. Halfway through my second glass, I began to feel the effects of the 9.0 ABV. After emptying that glass. I could barely get through this review without constantly hitting the Delete key over and over! Be careful!"
"This beer is very drinkable but don't let your guard down, she'll still sneak up on you and leave you on the floor drooling if you're not careful. A really decent pick up."
"D - Pretty good overall. Unique taste with malt, hops, and spices all present at one time or another. The only things that turns me away is the underlying presence of alcohol. Don't get me wrong good beer and I would drink another sometime, but not right now."
"D: great but beware- the 9% is well hidden"
"A pale amber color with giant stiff off-white head and good lace. Lots of tiny suspended particles evident. Very nice grapefruit-floral hops aroma with butterscotch. A creamy brew with the taste of malt and floral hops with a curious herbal/grain base. Very nice feel. Bitter finish that clings. Carbonation is modest and the drinkability is very good. Alcohol is notable but very manageable. Good job from San Diego. IPA fans will be pleased, relatively mild for an IIPA."
"NOt sure how many of these I could drink. 9%ABV would make this a difficult session beer. Still this is a very respectable Double IPA. I will certainly drink another if I get the chance."
"This one is 9% and so not really sessionable, but i found myself more pleased with this one a bit on the colder side when it seemed more balanced and therefore found myself trying to drink it fast. It will getcha if you do that tho!"
"poured into a tulip, this was a clear glowing orange-tinged gold on the initial pour and quite cloudy on the last pour. no sediment chunks noticed except what stuck to the bottom of the bomber. creamy, quickly diminshing white head settled to a nice ring of lacing that endured throughout. smells damn good. so good that i tried to keep smelling it as i drank it and almost choked as a result. twice. floral, bread, resiny, citric, and fresh, if that is an apt descriptor. fuck yeah. taste is a bit of bready malt sweetness that is dominated by the hop bitterness. but it's a smooth bitterness, not grainy or astringent as in some ipas or dipas. even for the style, this is on the hoppy side with it's sharp bitterness. mouthfeel is medium-bodied with just the right amount of creamy natural carbonation. looong bitter finish.. prickly on the palate. my overall impression is that this is very close to a dreadnaught, just not quite as well-balanced."
"Body is big, slick, and creamy. The malt presence is big, just enough to carry the massive hop flavors. Great drinkability, i finished a bomber and was looking for more!"
"A nice DIPA, nothing great."
"Overall, a decent brew for a hop head. certainly worth a try."
"Very, very drinkable, the mouthfeel is deceptive in regards to the abv%. I could easily drink this all night. Or, well... until I fell over."
"Another great effort from Green Flash."
"Creamy and a little thick. Somewhat bubbly with a pleasant sting on the way down. It's a terrifice, balanced Imperial IPA. It's not too hoppy, not hop-fetishistic."
"Notes: Have you ever crushed or cut garlic on a cutting board, washed it off and then use it later for cutting something else and find that the garlic lingered? I kinda get a little bit of that in the taste -- it's as if I'd cut some garlic on the cutting board, rinsed it less-than-thoroughly and then used that same board to cut up an orange on. Still, this was a pretty solid DIPA, probably the best new one I've tried in awhile. Worth checking out. . . ."
"Just like the IPA the palate is dominated by piny and citric hops. Also has a good malty taste."
"Slick and slightly oily in the mouth, muted carbonation is perfect for the brew. Despite the 101 IBU's and the 9% ABV, this is a really nice brew I'd like to sip on all evening."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent pale and Carapils malt scent along with a very bitter hop blast. The hop aroma is awesome. It really refreshes the senses. The taste is good also. It has a rich pale malt flavor that is complimented well with the choice of hops. This is a hop lovers dream. The Nugget hops are great. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable Imperial IPA. It's full of body as well as hops."
"This is a very enjoyable and drinkable DIPA. A little more complexity in the smell and taste would put it over the top. Still - it is an excellent example."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for its weight."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. The appearance was an orange-amber look with a thin head that become quick lacing. The aromas were phenomenal: wicked grassy and floral hops that filled the nostrils up. The taste was equally impressive with its earthy, sour-sweet dichotomy. Body wise was a solid medium mouthfeel. The attributes of taste and smell are really impressive with this one. All other aspects are pretty typical."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thick and pleasantly carbonated. Overall this is a kickin' DIPA with a nice bite to it. You already know if you'll like this one or not."
" On the bottle they claim this is a """highly quaffable""" brew. Yes. I want to slug these by the dozen but I will get to drunk and hurl on the keyboard eventually. Very clean and refreshing while at the same time it is excessively substantial."
"Sticky sweet, medium bodied, low carbonation with an earthy hop bitterness in the middle. Long dry finish with residual grapefruit rind flavors. This one is strong and sneaky...one bottle is enough for a 'session' but sharing might be a good idea."
"Overall a good effort. Definitely worth a try."
"on tap at the Bistro in Hayward, CA. Served golden/straw yellow, big froyhy white head. Great lacing. Huge pine aroma and some significant catty/garlic/onion. Tons of resinous pine and grapefruit notes. Very dry, but the hops stick in your mouth. Huge hop flavor, more garlic in the flavor. Heavy resinous thick, stick on your tongue hops. It's awsome. Kinda subtracts from the drinkability though. I think I need some water now."
"Taste is intense hops, more pine, and a nice malty middle. Very well balanced, yet strong flavors. Lingering oily hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkability great for an imperial IPA."
"Fruity, hoppy, and more hoppy, little carbonation, very drinkable, it was all I needed on a weekend night when I usually chase a bomber with a 12 oz. bottle, I would buy a few more of these and store them away, one for a month or two from now and one for the end of the summer, Id like to see how it ages a bit."
"This beer is everything I ask for in DIPA. It's nice and bitter, fruity (grapefruit), balanced, drinkable, and thankfully, not too sweet. Has some nice girth on the palate, yet goes down easily. A surprising treat, since I didn't know this was even available in this part of the world."
"I had 1 12oz pour which I could not finish."
"ipa's are what got me into drinking good beer and i would suggest this to anyone looking for some flavor."
"Overall, a solid IIPA and my first sample of a beer from this brewery. Worth a try if you get a chance to sample it."
"Poured from bottle into my affligem goblet. GVery clean looking beer- orange color with firm off white head. Head leaves tons of sticky lacing around glass. Not so abundant aromas. Somewhat lacking, but I pick up on some citrusy hops. Most Dipa's tend to blow me away with the smell, this one does not. Good hop bitterness from start to finish. Some citrus- grapefruit, orangey flavors with a lighter finish than expected. Makes it very drinkable for a double. Good beer!"
"Pours clear honey amberwith thick frothy head that is long lived and leaves a nice bubbly lace. Smells of floral hops, light sweet malt, and is just a little musty. The IF is well balanced between malt and bitter hops. The aftertaste is increasingly bitter and lingers for a long time. Medium bodied with a dry finish. Overall, this beer is pleasant if not terribly interesting. Clean flavor but not something I would seek out for a tasting and too strong for a session beer. For the price, buy a stone or an alesmith and you will be happier."
"Good looking beer, very clean with no carbonation bubbles. Aromas of light lemon but far from overly citrus. Can't believe this is a imperial ipa, not overly boozy. hoppy almost to the point where I would think this is an English style ipa. Probably not something I'd purchase again and I love every style ipa."
"I think this leads to a mouthfeel that is too thin to sustain overall drinkability. A fine ale in small quantities is my analysis; or if you're really just looking for a nice burst of flavorful hops."
"So I stupidly ordered this today at the Falling Rock after disliking three bottles! I'd drink one, get disgusted, and a couple months later I'd think """nah, must have been a bad bottle""" and I buy another which provides the same results. I'm so smart I thought well, I'll try it on tap! It looked great so I can't knock that. The aroma started hoppy and ok but then devolved into black pepper, fuck. The taste was more pepper, garlic, messed up. I cannot understand this beer. It does not make sense to me and I like hoppy beers. It is completely incongruous. Why can't they just make a double West Coast IPA?"
"D- Good warm weather beer, something to try between ales or with some cheeses."
"More please."
"This poured a hazy bright gold with light yellow head. It smelled like honey and lemon hops with some cultured yeast. It tasted super bitter and dry with a blend of citrus and copper hops and a slight alcohol flavor. It was watery with a bit of carbonation and a very clean aftertaste of strong bitterness. Overall this was a powerful beer, good for sipping. But its flavor wasn't as balanced, and it wasn't as thick as I hoped (compared to other 2IPAs)."
"Some relief comes as the beer warms but at that point I'm taking things slow. One of these is more than enough. Recommended for the most adventurous of hopheads. You have been warned."
"This one is worth checking out, and I will buy it again."
"D: Solid imperial ipa... its a good one to crack open from time to time..."
"As far as drinkability, when I open an Imperial IPA, I want to experience massive hops and bitterness, and got very little of this. I suppose this would make it even more drinkable for some, but for the style, it's not what I was looking for or hoping for."
"An unusual-flavored Double IPA. Obviously distinct; odd, but I'm craving more. An exciting, novel-tasting version of the style."
"D = This is an okay DIPA, but it is pretty one note."
"-Kevin."
"Good beer, the alcohol was well hidden to me. I don't think I could drink more than one bomber of these per sitting"
"Somewhat heavy as the bomber depletes, but overall a solid effort; there are more well-balanced options out there but this is a nice, rustic change of pace."
"Man, i could get in trouble drinking these. My taste buds werent shot after finishingh the bomber like what happens with some other D/IIPA's. Gonna have to pick up another one of these soon."
"Taste strongly complemented the aroma with a bombardment of freshly picked hops, bitter-sweet caramel, vanilla, honey, and candied sugars... The IPA taste was really on-point with this one, true-to-the style, and an above-average rendition of the genre, superb at all points, with hardly any defects except the hefty 9% ABV which was difficult to notice behind a tidal wave of fresh hops bursting with aroma and flavor... About as perfect to the style as you can get... Amazing stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"D: good beer overall but not something I would crave"
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a clear amber with moderate white head and good lacing. Nose of strong citrus and a medium mouthfeel. Flavor is mostly citrus hops, and it made me sneeze, the first time beer has ever done that. Long bitter finish. Alcohol quite noticeable."
"Not bad...I have had more memorable high octane beers in the IPA family."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a huge thick eggshell colored head. Left a wall of lacing as the head dissipated. The smell is of grassy/buddy and citrus hops, slight pine and resin, mango sweetness. What started as a nice grassy hop aroma didn't exactly translate into the taste. The taste starts off grassy but is quickly neutralized by a sweet honey bread malt. I must say I prefer my DIPAs to be onesided on the hop side, not balanced with a sweet sticky malt flavor. Anywho, the feel is moderate, with tingly carbonation, finishes with rough bitterness. Initially the alcohol is well hidden but after a while it shows up as some belly burn. I guess as DIPAs go, this is pretty middle of the pack; not outrageously hoppy nor a sickly sweet hop booze bomb."
"Somebody should send the Alstroms this bad boy. Hmm, maybe if I label it as a yeast extraction."
"Good, very good... and I like it. But it's not great. I like their West Coast IPA more than this."
"Thanks to Solomon420 for the treat!"
"D: Incredible drinkability, well balanced and goes down effortlessly. high recommend and very good enjoyability factor."
"A Very nice bright, piney, citrusy hoppy aroma. Slightly long bitter lasting flavor that is quite big but not undrinkable, especially for the style. I'm somewhat surprised I could handle the 101 IBUs enough to finish this, as this was one of my very first Double IPA ratings. Pretty nice, overall, but I think I prefer Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA, if its available. Worthy of a rerate however."
"Mouth feel is very coating, very full body. Nice finish. Aftertaste is however a bit concerning, but not overwhelming."
"Despite being a San Diego brewed IPA, it doesn't deliever as much hops as one might hope. But it sure does deliever with the booze : )"
"Upon revisiting this from an extremely fresh bottle, I've come around on it. A great beer, but freshness is key. The hop character is very unique, heavy on pine and raw onion."
"1042"
"Mouthfeel is thin. I don't like the taste they went for, here. The hop content isn't overpowering, yet it manages to be pretty raw. There's a balancing sweetness, but it's almost rotten ... kind of like apricots or pineapple gone bad. Just didn't like this whatsoever."
"Well done!"
"Copper in color, nice head, this beer almosts looks like your average Macro lager. Smell is piney with a small amount of grapefruit citrus. Taste is weak in this one. I am disappointed in the taste. Not a good DIPA by any means. Mouthfeel is average. I think if it tasted better I would be able to drink a ton of these since the taste is so weak. Overall, not impressed."
"The flavor isn't a far cry from the aroma; earthy, marijuana-esque peaty malts set an undertone for the terrorizing bitter, spicy, resinous hops. Mouthfeel delivers an onslaught to the tastebuds with a medium-bodied, viscous brew that finishes with a hoppy symphony. Surprisingly, this is a beer I could imagine drinking every night of the week and not get tired of...it's compex, tasty, and, at 9% ABV, gets the job DONE."
"Pours a clouded orange gold with almost no white head. Even without the head, I still rate it what I do because of the color. Nose is strong with grass and perfumed tones. Did I say it was strong with grass? Just want to make sure. Flavor is nice, but a bit too vibrant, shall we say. It sings a bit too high in my mouth at first. Of course over time I either get used to it or it calms down. I am sure it's that I get used to it. Thick floral hoppy flavor profile. It is nice, but kind of one-sided. Not massively complex, but who cares. It's nice. Feel has a decent bubble to it and the liquid is fairly well bodied. Nice to drink. Could easy go on this all night."
"D: Strong but very tasty."
"slightly hazy very light amber with a beautiful white crown that leaves georgeous lace as it slowly fades away. i've had this beer many many times, but had taken a brief hiatus from it. when i cracked this one open, i was instantly reminded of why i really like it. hop bomb. stinky, funky, grapefruity, bubblegummy, yummy. it's hard to get much else from it as far as malt and such goes because the hops are so beautiful and overpowering. taste is just like the nose suggests, with just a little piney thing in the finish. nice and full and creamy with a hint of bitter in the finish. a couple of these bombers ,and it's nap time, for sure. gogogreenflash!!!"
"The mouthfeel is intense without being heavy, and this is about as refreshing of an ale as I have ever had, with a dry feel and light carbonation, and an almost perfect dosguosing of the alcohol. What fun. Really. Can't wait for more."
"D - I wouldn't easily tire of this one."
"O - Overall a great beer, very drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden; great example of an Imperial IPA. The first time I had it I remember not liking it and am glad I gave it a second chance. It’s cool to see a Double IPA come out with some different hops. I am excited to brew a clone recipe of it."
" Nice brew for a fall sipper, packs a punch by the end. Different, but not one to miss."
"Since I love the taste of this beer so much, how could I give the drinkability less than a 5? Be aware of the abv, so enjoy this brew slowly. I was sad when my glass went empty."
"drinkability-well I drank quite a bit of this beer at the greenflash 5th anniversary and then I went to stone for more beer afterwards...and got denied beer because I was slurring...so I would say it is drinkable but watch out!"
"Overall: It's a nice looking brew that starts off so nice. I just can't get over the odd taste in the middle. It starts great and finishes wonderful, but when its all said and done it's just okay."
"Feels oily and smooth, and very drinkable. Really nice."
"d: certainly fits the style, just didn't have anything that really stood out, but worth a try"
"All in all, a good DIPA."
"I love it. I love it. I love it."
"The beer dispenses from the 22-ounce bottle a somewhat hazy golden orange to amber with a majestic creamy white head that lingers long before vanishing, lace forms a solid sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, pushed by the hop floral aroma, lime like in its crispness, delightful sniff. Start has a decent malt presence, hops provide a huge spicy bite, top is moderate in feel. Finish has a strong acidity, the hops potent in their spiciness, sweet, bitter aftertaste welds itself to your palate, excellent beer, and a delight for hop heads."
"I always like to get my hands on some """San Diego style""" Double IPA's this is one and I was pleased with it.Poured into an imperial pint glass a mix of golden and deep reddish orange a tight formed 1/2 finger head that held decent retention atop,mix of hop aromas overripe pineapple and deep pine resin show through along with a big caramel sweetness the alcohol is hidden.Citrusy flavors at the forefront along with some pine resin wich becomes stronger as it warms more in my mind a very hefty caramel sweetness holds firm against the hops till the finish.Its very solid and the alcohol is kept in check very well,obviously there are better DIPA'S out there but it will cure a hop fix."
"Nice and drinkable, but lots of better DIPAs out there for my taste."
"Rough at first taste,tames out the more you drink. A good double in the middle of the pack. Te bomber was enough for me. Worth a try,would definatly drink again."
"Not available locally here in NY, however I will definitely buy this again should I come across it."
"This brew seems to need more or less of something to make it really sing. It should either go more over the top, to the point where you don't care about imbalance because of the strong perspective... or some more balance.There are many double IPA's out there, and well, this is one of them!"
"There is a slight woody/tanin feel to the mouthfeel, rosin maybe. Very silky smooth, really one of the best I've had in the style. As the bottle states it is in fact quaffable."
"Drinkability - This would be a nice bar sipping beer. I could order this all night."
"I haven't liked Green Flash Brewery's non-hoppy beer. Their hoppy beer is a different story entirely, with a much happier ending. Extra Pale Ale is wonderfully drinkable and West Coast IPA has gotten some much deserved respect. Imperial India Pale Ale doesn't match Southern California's finest, but if I had access, I'd buy a bomber every now and then as an interesting change of pace."
"Pours a nice hazy pale orange with a decent frothy head that was slow to diminish. The aroma was dominated by floral citrus and pine hops with just a hint of sweet malt. The taste was possessed wonderful earthy hoppiness that somewhat overpowered the malts, but not too much at all. The beer was somewhat heavy with nice warming alcohol that was present but not aggressive. This is a very enjoyable beer and one I would love to have again."
"A two finger off white head establishes itself on top of a orange amber body that is a nice combination. Leaves a bit of lace. Softly fragrent ripe citrus based hops dance on a very inviting nose. Very grassy fresh green hop feel as it enters the mouth. Pine notes are very strong on the front of the palate. A slight bit of sweetness develops twords the end. high alchol content but it is well hidden. Very woodsy fresh. Thick mouthfeel is kicked up by the hops. Extremely drinkable."
"22 ounce bomber, pours clear light amber, with that oily, slightly greenish hue that I welcome in a hoppy SD style DIPA, Light tan, creamy, tiny bubble, long lasting head and thick film. Also leaves nice sheeting and sticky reams of lace. Blast o'citric hops for the sniffer. Smooth, heady brew, more grapefruity hop waves, riding on a fluffy bed of bread crusty malts. Yum yum, finely crafted creation. """SD style""" DIPA is the fushizzle...love this stuff, giddy to find it on my way thru New Jersey...Its great to be an American..."
"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a deep copper color ale with huge foamy head with perfect retention and some good lacing. Aroma of red grapefruit is astonishing and up there with the best of the style. Taste is also dominated by some red grapefruit with some medium bitterness and some light caramel malt. Body is above average with some good carbonation. I have to admit that this hop bombs is definitely better then standard IIPA out there."
"Drinkability is good. A nice double IPA, but not quite in the top of the style."
"Taste follows nose; bitter herbal quallity blend nicely with the floral and citrus. Green vine and a pinch of dates comes through as well. Alcohol is noticeable. Great bite to it, clean finish. A 22oz bottle is a bit much, but I made good of it."
"Drinkability: Big, hoppy beers are almost always fun to drink and this one is no exception. As such, I won't give it a pass, but there are loads of better 2IPA's regularly available in the Los Angeles area."
"Drinkability: Considering the intense flavors, this goes down decently."
"Golden color with a white head, lots of lacing left on the glass. Less copper color than many other ales of this style. The aroma is filled with citrus and pine flavor, and ends with a nice malty note. Smooth malty bitterness begins on the tongue, then turns into a sharp hop flavor which is balanced on the finish with sweet malt flavor. The bottle claims 101 IBUs but it shouldnt deter any true hophead. Summit and Nugget hops give this Imperial IPA a unique flavor. This ale is very drinkable despite its 9 percent strength."
"Overall, pretty good representation of the style. I have had better, but not that many better."
"Very drinkable and solid rendition of the style."
"The drinkability rating is somewhat skewed by my inability to determine whether I think it is a 'mild' or a 'smooth' Double IPA. I feel a little let down but at the same time I want to go get another one to see if I can figure out how I really feel about it. However, at 9% ABV (which was unnoticeable) I will have to visit this beer again some other day. I do highly recommend it, though."
"Overall this was everything I thought it would be. I super duper hopped double IPA from a great west coast brewery. Truly a treat to behold. I really enjoyed it and I am glad I have another for later on."
"Recieved from jasonm in the jbif. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Bottle opened with an extremely loud bang. Poured a very clear pale golden color. About two good fingers of bubbly, thick, off-white head formed. Head settled slowly, and left a thick layer of lace about half way down the glass. Huge citrus aromas were present. Tons of lemon, grapefruit, and some somewhat grassy, bitter hops. Maybe some pineapple notes as well. All the citrus and hops were smoothed out nicely with a very present maltiness. Tons of resiny hops assault your tastebuds as soon as you take a sip. More strong citrus, Some bitter hops and a smooth pine presence. A little hint of bread in the background as well. No really noticeable alcohol in the mouth, moderately carbonated. Nice smooth full bodied mouthfeel that pleases the palate. Very drinkable, smooth, well balanced and enjoyable."
"A solid DIPA. Lots of piney hop flavor and firm bitterness. I love this style and this is a nice example. Bottoms up!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a bit of a biting carbonation, and the drinkability is good."
"D: Very drinkable for a DIPA. The 9% is hard to find until it catches up with you at the end. It is very well balanced and it goes down very easy. Another solid west coast DIPA, definitely worth checking out."
"d- Wow, this is one delicious and well-balanced DIPA that truly masks the abv, I could have several of these in a sitting without getting bored, all praise the San Diego craftbrew scene!!!"
"Thanks BeerTruth!"
"22 Oz Bottle. Lemon, cat and Simcoe heavy aroma, dosed with heaps of resins and cones. Mostly piney with nips of orange liqueur. Pours a sainted clean, clear gold with a rim of linen white. On the mouth, initially a standard double IPA, with bristling pine cones, warm bready sugars, and a whole chaotic swirl of hop characters. A halcyon of cone production. This sorts out into a drier, bitter herbal quality, with the malt falling behind and finding a seat behind turpentine and grain alcohol. A nip warm and nosing, but generally composed of pleasing hop flavors. Im not sure if I would have chose to build this beer with only Summit and Nugget, but as a duo they mostly get the job done before losing to a scathing bath of grass alcohols. Unique and somewhere in the field of decent west coast IIPAs. Some weird awkward tropical fruits and coarse grain characters show up down the line."
"drinkability is ok. fairly well balanced. the flavour didn't really do it for me and seemed to be a bit of a letdown after the great appearance and nice aroma."
"Pours a dark golden with a decent initial head that fades to a thin cap. Pretty good lacing. Smells of spearmint, coriander, bubblegum. Unusual hop profile in the smell, also quite dry. Taste is somewhat similar, but the coriander note is quite a bit more restrained. Alittle waxy and a little beefy tasting with big but meaty/earthy hops.I don't get much citrus. I like the regular ipa quite a bit better than this. The alcoholseems somewhat restrained.A little slick in the mouth with a fairly big, dry body. Not the most drinkable beer on the planet. Very dry, alcoholic, and with a hop profile that doesn't charm makes it a one time thing for me."
"The taste is very boozey upfront, syrupy mouthfeel, followed by sugary tropical fruit, that is quickly washed away by that resiny bitterness. This is a solid IIPA and stands up to any of the best out there solid offering from Green Flash now I want to try more!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, excellent representation of style, great kick, this beer has everything that you look for in a 2IPA. It’s a great beer that I could drink until the 9.00% ABV catches up with me."
"Recommended"
"Appears a copper apricot cla see through color off white head forms thick leaves even lace behind. Aroma has heavy grapefruit citrus and some tropical fruit flow touch of pineapple as well as some sugary malt biscuit sweetness and evident alcohol in the nose. Flavor is raw west coast hop character with leafy, citrus grapefruit hop flavor and bitterness hits hard big hop burps after one or two sips, light biscuit malt character with some sugary sweetness underlying. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied resinous oily slick texture even abonation flows pretty well grapefruit peel lacquer is left on the palate. Drinkability a solid west coast DIPA I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to meet up with this bad boy."
"Drinks very good for the abv, just a little to heavy handed on the grapefruitty hops for me"
"D: Pretty good, the 9% makes its presence known, but doesn't overtly knock you out. I agree with the label, highly quaffable for an Imperial IPA, this is a great beer."
"None the less a very tasty brew in small doses...hop to it!"
"Pours a clear bright orange with a huge fluffy white three finger head. Grabs a hold of the glass extremely well. Takes a while to die down to a nice layer that stays the whole tasting. Wow, smell is pure pine, strong evergreen odor. Honsestly there is nothing else I can smell but I like it. Taste is a whole lotta pine hops that dries out the mouth quickly. Flavor in the end is a very dry/bitter bite. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. I really did enjoy this DIPA because I'm a hophead, but I would like to see more than just pine dominating the flavor and smell, definitely worth a try though."
"D - Above Average DIPA, Worth A Try"
"Pours a hazy yellow color, with a nice thick white head that thins out nicely, into my Green Flash pint glass (thanks to Cost Plus World Market). Good lacing as well. Smell was very strong pine and resin and some citrus notes. Taste was awesomely piney and bracing. Wonderful lingering bitter hop aftertaste. This is exceptionally drinkable given high abv. One of my first big west coast hop bombs and I can't wait to keep drinking them. Yum."
"This is actually pretty drinkable for a DIPA, or IIPA as they call it, although I don't think this was brewed for an Imperial court...the balance, and 'restraint' of the hops, for a west coast DIPA, make this an easy drinker that doesn't beat up the pallet to much. As usual for the style, I think it's better on the colder side then warm, a little less then fridge temp."
"Poured out of a 22oz bottle a nice orange-ish hazy color with a nice head retention. Aromas of a sweet citrusy hop. It is nice and hoppy, grapfruity, and a little sticky. Tons of lacing on the glass, that sticky hop lacing. It also hides its 9% really well."
"This beer pours a golden orange color with a nice fluffy white head that is leaving a nice lacing in my glass. Nose is a blast of citrusy hops, mmmm. Taste is somewhat malty but finishes near perfectly with a whopping amount of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth for the style. Overall drinkability is very good despite the high abv. This is a very good representation of style and it compares quite well to the other San Diego hop peddlers high IBU brews."
"Highly recommended - San Diego - and Green Flash - sure know how to brew 'em. And, for a more in depth review, so my bottle review of this one."
"probably the easiest drinking double ipa i've had. the abv and hops go down so well its scary. these guys know hops and how to use them."
"Wow, my first beer from Green Flash and I will add this to my favorites list. I always feel when you pour a double IPA and it is light in color, that it will either be a mediocre IPA or a superb hoppy dream and the later is what you will get from this beer."
"22 oz bomber. Nice slightly hazed dark orange coloured beer, with a nice looking off white frothy,thick head. Pungent hoppy aroma, transcending the usual pine..till I get a whiff of green onion! All hop. Very bitter indeed, grapefruit, pine,crab apples,thankfully none of the """green onion""" makes it to the taste, but this is all mouth puckering juicy bitterness. I believe the 101 IBU! Ok mouthfeel , though the unrelenting bitterness does challenge the taste buds. Overall an OK beer..for sure a great one for hopheads. But for me it went just too far."
"Flavor develops as oily hops make way to more piney, sharp hop flavors. A nice grain flavor shows itself as the brew warms."
"Not really wowed by any particular aspect of this DIPA however I am glad that this brew lacks the cascade/centennial hop character that is so overused in IPAs these days."
"Drinkability - This is a fairly drinkable Imperial IPA. The alcohol is hidden very well, so be careful."
"Mouthfeel is a bit furry from all of the hops. Drinkable, but I prefer some discernible malt in both the nose and the palate. I was surprised this has a lot of Summit in it - the few other beers I've had that were hopped with that beers have tasted of scallions to me, so this was a pleasant surprise. Also, the 9+% alcohol was well hidden. Thanks to marc77 for the trade!"
"Overall a very drinkable beer, glad that I had a bomber for a second glass."
"I just have one question for this beer: Where's the alcohol. This beer is so smooth it reminds me of drinking an Pale ale. Simply incredible. With a straw like color, piney smell, and flavor of drinking a mellow pale ale. Simply incredible, I would have to say prove to me this is a 9% alcohol beer, it surely tastes awesome, but the alcohol is hidden without a doubt."
"Pours a crystal clear amber, huge fluffy white head forms, massive chunky lace, nice retention, looks pretty damn good. Smell is kind of subdued, but grapefruit and pineapple, floral, caramel, some pine hops, pretty nice although not destroying my nasal passage. Taste is nice, grapefruit, some pineapple, floral, caramel, honey, resinous hops, some fruity alcohol notes in the finish, perfect bitterness, but leaves something to be desired. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky, low carbonation, nice alcohol warming, which is hidden pretty well. Nice solid DIPA, won't knock your socks off but drinks pretty good."
"22 oz. bottle- color of dark orange , with a decent off white head - nose of fresh hops , pine , mint , resin , cannabis , and slight malts  taste of fresh hops , slight mint , resin , cannabis , and slight malts - body is smooth, but too watery , and with low to medium carbonation  aftertaste of some metallic , hops , and resin"
"This has to be one of the most drinkable Imperial IPAs I have tried yet"
"Beautiful golden IPA with a very substantial head that's not going anywhere. The smell is what you expect from a great IPA, nothing more or less. Big and hoppy. The taste is honey & hops. I was recently talked out of using nugget hops for a recipe, and this beer has talked me right back into them. This beer is basically flawless, the only thing missing is the x-factor that is packed by a Stone or Alesmith. The mouthfeel is creamy, and the nuggets leave their mark at the end of the quaff. This is a big winner for Green Flash, whose other products I haven't enjoyed nearly as much."
"Drinkability- Not a bad choice for a DIPA. Not sure what that stale taste at first was, but it didn't take away too much from it. I'd try it again."
"Updated to increase scores. On tap at Barclay's this was delicious. The fresher version had less syrupy sweetness and a more complex hop character. Glad I tried this in its freshest form, GF is a good brewery."
"One of my favorite West Coast IPAs, Green Flash has an amazing hoppiness to it, in both smell and taste. The bitterness is slightly overwhelming at first, but this beer is amazing at slightly under room temperature. I was able to get a growler of this being directly poured from a cask down in Maryland. It had about 1/2 inch of yeast down at the bottom, and an amazing cloudiness to it."
"Drinkability - I could easily have two of these a night. It is smooth for the most part, with a good taste. Plus, it goes really well with poultry or game. Enjoy this brew."
"All in all... quite enjoyable, and one I will certainly grab again at $4.99 a bomber."
"Mouth: Almost no carbonation. Overly sweet. Quite bitter, w/ lingering hop flavors and alcohol heat. The malt character is quite boring, no depth - just unfermented sugar (maybe brown sugar flavor?) and pounding grapefruit hoppiness. Served this one around 55-60 degrees hoping that would open it up a bit, but nothing's going on here. I'm thinking some chilling may have improved the mouthfeel, but it's really pretty undrinkable."
"I like this but it may not be for everyone."
"Super fresh, drank within two weeks of being bottled. Light gold, very nice head. Fairly nice hop nose but not super great. Awfully drinkable. It goes down super easy. Nice body. Nice hop flavor. A good Double IPA, but far from great, especially for being so fresh."
"I was pleased with the Green Flash IPA so I guess I shouldnt be surprised I enjoyed this product so much. I guess its the first time in a while Ive had an extreme beer thats surprised me some and thats a good thing. You can only get knocked off your bar stool so many times before they all start tasting basically the same Very well done."
"Cheers!"
"Outstanding DIPA that is exceedingly drinkable."
"A """San Diego-style IPA""" as it says on the label...known for being super hoppy. Just what I needed after a long day of field work, a hop-infused kick in the ass! This beer poured a nice clear copper color with a strong white head that clung to the upper rim of my tulip glass. A pungent and beautiful aroma of dank and herbal green hops with a whispering of pine forest and cannabis was the first thing I noticed. After warming, and a few swirls, I was able to conjur up a fruity, almost champagne-like aroma that came through in the effervescence. The aroma seemed to have many layers, and evolved as the beer warmed. The taste of the beer also really shows off the hops, with notes of pine resin (not unlike some of the flavors in retsina, a Greek wine made with pine resin), fresh herbs, grass. Lots of Nugget and Summit hops used here, as mentioned on the label, and the 101 IBU rating reflects this. Some cookie malt flavors were muted to the background and really only provided a base for which to showcase the hops. I thought the consistency was very good for the style. With the 9% ABV, a little strong for too many but still drinkable if you are in the mood for a hop bomb!"
"The pine and grapefruit come through pretty strongly in the flavor. IBU's off the charts. If there's any malt in there, I don't really see them, which I think detracts overall from the style and beer in general. Very good in and of itself. Mouthfeel was smooth, leaving the tongue parched afterwards, requiring another drink, leaving the tongue parched...Next thing you know, its gone."
"22 ozer ... pour a nice light, bright orange, with a massive airy, rocky head. of white foam. Pure hop nuggets assault the olfactory glands on the first whiff ... wow ... quite the tease for the hophead like me. As I begin to drink it, the utter oily, resiny hoppiness starts pouring down my gullet before the first bit of liquid touches the lips. Surprisingly the beer itslef is less brutally hoppy than all that aroma suggests. Instead, its nice and even-keeled with a decent citrus hop flourish, but without being overwhelming. Still a lot of resiny, oily hop here, but blended into a light-to-the-lips beer. Wow. (#2758, 3/18/2007)"
"Pours a nice copper orange with nice fizzy head. Aromas are interesting and strong. Huge floral hop aroma, some biscuity malts. Now, i know that hops are botanical cousins to cannabis, but goddamn. Aromas are strong in that department. The volatile hop oils transfer to the taste, where the flavors are too overwhelming. Nice bitterness, but its all too much in the end. Malts are not really present, not that your numb tongue would be able to discern them. Slight alcohol burn. Smooth and dry finish. Perfect DIPA for some hop-heads, and other """-heads", but not for me."
"Pours a light copper color and clear with a decent sized off white, light tan head that slowly chunks up and lightly laces on the glass. Citrus aroma, grapefruit, some lemon and a soft powdered sugar sweetness. Some fresh grassiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows the aroma closely with a light citrus sweetness up front that is slowly overtaken by a grassy dry and fairly bitter finish. Medium in body, a low to medium amount of carbonation. Alcohol is slightly evident in the finish but is fairly well balanced for its size. Nothing that was knocking my socks off flavor wise, but still a good beer with a decent amount of raw bitterness."
"Hazy, murky faint amber in color. Sizeable head. Big piney and resiny hop aroma-very frsh smelling as well. Grapefruit flavors dominate with a nice """catty""" characteristic to it. Not as sweet and malty as some DIPAs I have had. Not as much pucker to it either. Good body-quite dry in the finish. Very drinkable beer though there are some better ones out there. Between this and their West Coast IPA it all sort of gets blurred. Well worth consuming however."
"I like the taste, but this one is kind of rough. Unbalanced is a bit of an understatement."
"Great job Green Flash. Stick to the stronger beers like this and your equally excellent Barleywine."
"Hazy light copper. Frothy one finger head. Ivory white. Lace comes in webby rings. Got a great nose of juicy pink grapefruit pulp, bong resin and leather. My kind of nose for an IIPA. The flavor is pretty good too. It's got that grungey, resiny, oily hop feel to it. I get a hint of garlic on the palate as well. The malts are firm. They don't stand out obviously, but they don't fucking back down either. Toffee and caramel come to mind in this malt backbone. Alcohol gives a little bit of a lingering spiciness. But for 9%, I really don't get much on the buds. Very interesting and quite good. I could drink a few of these. For 101 IBUs, the bitterness really doesn't seem over-the-top."
"Slick, oily moutheel to this full body beer. Resiny hop oils coat the entire mouth. I can taste the dryness, but I can barely feel it...if that makes any sense. I am glad that Green Flash has finally made it to my neck of the woods. I will be grabbing this one regularly."
"Drinkability: The IBUs are high, but thankfully the alcohol burn is pretty much absent, giving more focus to the flavor. Plus, at around $5 a bottle there's enough here for hopheads to like. I'll probably stick to the barley wine, but overall this was a pretty good experience, and it can certainly last a while too, which is also a plus."
"Wow, this just wasn't good. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but I was at least hoping for a decent, drinkable DIPA. What I got was a complete mess. Now I don't mind bitterness, but if there's no hop flavor to go along with it, then it's pointless. I couldn't find a date on this bottle, so I'm almost wondering if it's a little past its prime or otherwise tainted. If all the bottles taste like this, then I would recommend staying away from this beer. I've had this brewery's barleywine and it's much better, so I'd suggest going with that instead."
"D: A very wonderful beer to indulge in. High abv is masked by the grapefruit and other hop flavors, although it comes through slightly in the spicyness. Very smooth. Almost bordering on a barleywine in my opinion. Nice one from Green Flash."
"The body was very clear, light copper color with a small sticky off white head. Very nice citrus nose, mostly orange rind with a slight piney smell. The taste starts off very bitter, in a good way, then a citrus fruity sweetness hits and a small bit of biscuity malt. It finshes pretty clean with slight lingering piney bitterness. The texture was creamy and smooth, very drinkable. A very good DIPA."
"The drinkability is good, for the price a great deal and I just might get more. Prosit MK"
"D: This is a very good beer. I just feel like something is missing - certainly not the malt - I like it the way it is but it just needs a little tweaking. Overall a classic representation of the style. If you are a hop head you should enjoy this one. But I can see why it is not for everyone. I will definitely try this again at the next opportunity."
"D: If you love hops, you can pick this up without hesitation. If you love balance, look elsewhere. I find this beer to be bracing, warming, and absolutely obnoxious. And in an imperial IPA, that's a virtue."
"All in all, a solid imperial IPA. Ill pick up another bottle soon."
"A year and a half later, in bottle. Good, orange, average DIPA. And on tap 1.5 years later, even better. Lots of lace."
"Which is about the only thing that keeps this beer from being highly sessionable. A good offering. I would have again."
"Could use a firmer malt foundation, but if you're looking for some aggressive hops, they are here. Not sure that Green Flash really needs an Imperial IPA, considering their wonderful West Coast IPA, but it's certainly worth trying."
"Harsh metallic/medicinal notes kick off this taste-bud obliterator. The 101 IBU's are more than apparent (coupled with a pine sensation) as my palate puckers in defense of this affront to my senses. I love DIPA's when they are done well, but this one is not. Too one sided, with very little balance (a note of sweetness appears towards the end, I think. My mouth was a little too busy recuperating to notice)."
"Not bad in the drinkability department so long as you don't mind that faint onion flavor, since I love onion and garlic breads this is not a problem. It isn't a very strong flavor and many would miss the taste. This is no Russian River or Three Floyds product but I could see buying this again if nothing like that were available."
"Pretty clear, light orange colour with a fluffy, off-white head. Finer bubbles tended to stick to the glass, leaving the coarser ones to form a cap on the beer. Piney, earthy hop aroma with a bit of powdery aspirin and just a hint of cattiness. Bitterness dominates the flavour with just a little malt sweetness backing it up (you really have to look for it). Hop flavour abounds, lots of pine resin and grapefruit rind, earthy notes and a little spicey. The lingering hop bitterness definitely leaves the palate dry. Medium bodied with average carbonation, a little on the coarse side yet appropriate somehow. Quite a hop bomb, but it still manages to hold together."
"Overall a nice, average DIPA (god, did I just call a DIPA average? strange world)"
"Being a big fan of Green Flash's West Coast IPA, picking up a bombers of these was a no brainer. Unlike the regular IPA, the balancing of this was off enough for me to be disappointed. The grapefruit ting was a bit much. Still this was a not bad offering and certainly worthy of a try. Me, I'll stick to their IPA."
"D - Pretty good, the mouthfeel could afford to be better and the abv makes its presence know much more than it should. But it really isn't bad all around. I probably won't have it again (especially with that delicious barleywine for the same price), but if offered, I wouldn't pass it up.."
"I am now sold on any beer this place puts out...but it is their IPA's that will keep me coming back again and again."
"A very nice DIPA, with good drinkability. A good example of the style, it maintains some control where many others become unbalanced. Hopheads will want to get their hands on this brew."
"Drinkability: the high alcohol levels drop this down a bit. Overall this was a very fresh and tasty DIPA. One bottle will keep you busy for a while."
"Very good FRESH DIPA."
"Cheers."
"Beer is good. Happy 2IPA beering."
"Deliciously hoppy, yet at times aggressively burning; this is certainly an exercise in self flagellation. I had forgotten how enjoyable a raw, aggressive hop bomb could be, but at the same time it makes me remember that this (and most examples of the style) is not something I would want to be drinking every day."
"The was an excellent DIPA with a very distinct hop profile from many of the other DIPAs out right now. Cheers!"
"D:"
"Md to md-light body and heavy carbonation. not very drinkable, but it got me a good lit on."
"This was one of the better imperial IPA's I've had in a while. The color was a bit on the light side, and very well filtered, which left me somewhat suspicious at first. The nose was great, with lots of piney and sweet resin notes. The taste was great - this is the type of beer that first got me hooked on big IPA's - a big west-coast style that's all hop and no balance. Stuff is hop juice. Mouthfeel was good, a bit undercarbonated and almost flat though. Very drinkable. I still don't really think it was a 9%er. Had this stuff on Tap at Friscos in Columbia. Cheers."
"I know that one of these days hops are gonna kill my taste buds, but I love 'em. This one is no exception."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter, mildly sweet, and semi-dry."
"D: The drinkability is limited by the higher abv and a taste that is too bitter and unfocused. Stick with the West Coast IPA for a nice hop flavor."
"There is something of a smoothness about it, and plenty of hops, but the overwhelming pine, slight mustiness, and acidity make this fit the """mediocre""" category for this style pretty well. Not a total loss if you are into pine, but I won't be getting this one again."
"I've got to say that I've very disappointed in this. The Green Flash West Coast IPA I really enjoy sometimes, this one just doesn't do it at all. Very unbalanced, harsh hoppiness, with no malt to back it up. Their standard IPA is much better. For that matter, their barleywine is a far better DIPA than this is... I won't be buying it again..."
"Overall, this was a bit of a let down. I like their IPA, so I was looking forward to this, but it was not as good."
"Notes: Love this brewery. I had to re-review this offering as it has grown on me and now I love this thing. My first impressions were that it was too raw but in the right mood this thing is a hop lovers dream. I can appreciate the quality of this. Double up that hop recipe for the west coast IPA and you'll have beer gold. For now though this brew has a time and a place where it fits perfectly. In typical Green Flash style the price is very reasonable."
"Of the several Green Flash beers I've tried, this is my favorite. Good work- keep it up!"
" Body is rich and a little syrupy, which tends to be the case with some of these DIPAs that verge on being hop wines. Still, very drinkable, although the 9% alcohol asserts itself about halfway through the bottle. Maybe find a friend to share this one with."
"not bad, worth a try but don't expect to be blown away. unless you like to suck on pine needles all the live long day (you freak you)"
"Pours a clear golden color with a huge head of small/medium off white bubbles. Sharp, perfume pine/herbal aroma. A touch of lemongrass and chives(?). Taste is smooth and well balanced between the bitter hops and sweet malt. A touch of garlic(?) in the aftertaste with a lingering clean bitterness. The garlic and chives take over as it warms. I happen to like both, but Im not sure that is what I would go for in a beer Odd, but enjoyable for me. Not for everyone. The label states that Summit and Nugget hops were used. I am assuming the Summit hops are giving it the onion/garlic character. I never got that from Nugget. 22oz was enough. I almost got sick of it at the end."
"All in all, this beer is very drinkable if you love hops. I can get past the sub par malt presence because of the hop aroma and taste. The 9% ABV is masked rather nicely as well. I will go back for several of these."
