"Overhyped, plain and simple. At around $20 a sixpack in the RVA area, I was disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a tasty and unique IPA, but only good fresh from my experience."

"Great beer just hard to get even in Michigan"
""
""
""
""
""
"I love getting this beer when it comes around. Perfect subtle honey taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way overrated and nowhere near the hype. Had 2 of my 6 pack and gave the other 4 away to friends. To each their own. But there are much better beers at a much better price point imho."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Completely overrated, was tame and meh with the sweetness, so much hype and it was just meh, you're better off with a knee deep simtra.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Been about 7 years since I last had one. While it wasn't the hop bomb I remembered, it tasted just as good. That's not to say it isn't hoppy, but after 7 years of drinking really hoppy beers it didn't hit me quite the same way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Couldn't get a whole lot on the smell but the hop taste was certainly there deceiving me.  What an amazing beer for a 10% IPA I can't wait to get more of this next year.  The honey makes this beer brilliant!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer if you want to get drunk, not if you want to enjoy getting drunk"

"I was very excited to try hopslam but was not blown away ..Think there is why to much Hype I wont go nuts seeking it out next year"
""
"Meh... seemed overly sweet.  Good but there are better."
"This year's Hopslam is great!"
"If you are an IPA lover or Hops lover in general, this beer is an absolute MUST HAVE. I love IPA's and Hoppy beers in general and this one is the strongest I've ever had in that regard. But what makes this beer a 5 out of 5 for me is the addition of the honey flavor ... It is the icing on the cake and it's what really makes this beer DELICIOUS!"
""
""
""
""
"Perfect hoppy beer that will slam you."
""
"2 months later found another bottle in the cellar, sad to say it is much different.  My fault though.  Much maltier and way less hop aroma.  Do not sit on this beer."
"Limited time only and I couldn't drink enough to satisfy my needs! Love this double IPA. I wish I could have this year round. But I understand the availability of the outstanding Simcoe Hops!"
""
""
""
"Prominent honey taste. Not terribly bitter, but has a citrus bite. Well balanced, delicious."
""
"Honey came in right at the end ,just right."
""
"I honestly was worried the hype would kill this beer. But it's a beautiful beer to taste. 10 minutes after pouring the bubbles are still rising. The aroma is very nice and fresh. It tastes so balanced and feels oh so crisp. An amazing IPA."
"Full IPA flavor with light bitterness yet smooth and pleasant aftertaste."
"Personally not hoppy enough to justify it being so sought after"
""
""
""
""
"Way too hoppy for my liking"
""
"This has to be a got to get when its out, I buy it and drink it..no holding this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice kick taste of honey and citrus"
""
""
"First dipa.  Very grape fruity"
""
"A bit boozy but the honey helps balance that out, has sort of a toffee, caramel hint to it on top of the citrus, piney you expect in a IPA"
""
"This beer is simply one of my favorite beers."
"12 oz bottle packaged on 01/11/15 poured into a snifter.  A perfectly balanced DIPA, glad I finally got my hands on a bottle."
""
""
"Probably the best APA I've had. Great flavor with a nice finish."
""
""
"Lots of caramel, toffee and vanilla on the nose (aside from the standard IPA pine and citrus). Far maltier than I expected. Balanced. Very impressive."
""
"Delicious. Wow the flavor just delicious."
""
"For all of the hype this beer gets,  I do not get it.  I have had a lot of great beers from Bell's but imo I would pass."
""
""
""
""
"Too boozy for my liking. Not well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it but knowing it's 10% abv, I wouldn't want to drink too much in one sitting."
"Big mango and dank/sticky pine resin notes, fresh/wet grass, honey aftertaste. Medium/full body with very little alcohol taste considering the 10% abv. Great balance, leaves nothing desired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't get the hype.  Think the field has passed this one."
""
""
"Overall both beers are still pretty good, though the old beer does seem a little less interesting, and maybe a little less bitter, the old beer is still pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great beer. Nice event beer, one to sit and enjoy."
"good beer. has a nice sweet smell with a good off white head. tastes pretty damn good with a slight alcohol presence in the aftertaste. well worth a try"
""
"All im goin to say. It blew my mind."
""
""
""
"Always good! Nice aroma, good body, a bit bitter, not overly malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Good, strong floral hops. Grape and passion fruits. Pineapple. Biscuit. Lavender honey. It's well above decent as far is DIPAs are concerned, but it doesn't sing to me in the same ways others have."
""
""
"This years batch did not wow me."
""
"Amazing taste. The honey really covers up the boozy back taste."
"Gold draft pour with off white head into 10oz snifter; great lacing. Sweet honey glazed biscuits and some floral hop notes. Malt balances well with hops to hide alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and honey tongue coating. Genius in a bottle."

"comes off as one note. not a fan."
""
"O-a very easy drinking beer considering the abv. Excellent balance between the hops and malt profile, while creating nice transitions between the flavors. well crafted brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had it from a firkin first and from a traditional tap next. The review is from the tap. Having the two really made me appreciate it a little more. The first few, on other occasions, I felt as though I was trying to like it more than I actually did like it. Tonight is the first time I understood the hype."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unique flavor with a little pineapple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Keg release at the World of Beer, it wasn't as exciting as I was expecting."
"This beer is strong. It has that nice hoppy sting, scent, and aftertaste. A tremendous brew from a tremendous brewery."
""
"Smells incredible. Tastes very good. All the rage? Nah, but worth a try. Huge citrus and floral nose that stays with initial sip. Sweeter than most, but not overwhelming."
"We were only able to get 1 case of slam in at the shop, and after setting my sixer aside the other 3 were sold before hitting the shelf. First time for me from the bottle, but it tastes just as fresh and pine-citrusy as draft. I love the mouthfeel, really into the carbonation and tight bubbles. Astounding dipa!"
""
"This beer should be called Hypeslam"
""
"Great beer but it has too much sweetness from the honey added.  Comes through too much."
"O: good beer, that was not quite what I expected from a beer with the name HopSLAM.  I expected a beer that was  overpoweringly Hoppy that made my tastebuds melt.  I didn't expect much malt to come through in this beer.  The beer came through with a good hoppiness in the beginning with a strong maltiness at the end.  After you swallow there the happiness returns, only in the aftertaste.  It is def a pretty beer with the alcohol hidden well in the flavors.  I am happy I stumbled upon this in the store but I would not go out of my way to hunt it down.  Would definitely like to try it right out of the tap and a little more fresh to see if there is a bigger difference."

"Picked this one up in a trade and its my first one ever. Poured into a nonic with a pale, orange color. As it warms I get a boozy, piney and citrusy aroma. The taste is spectacular. Bursting with hops and fresh citrus, some grapefruit notes. The addition of honey is more like an after-thought, but lends a nice balanced sweetness.  As it warms on the palate the alcohol comes through and leaves a pleasant mouthfeel. Its slightly carbonated and dry. Overall, it's a wonderful DIPA. Hopslam lives up to the hype."
"Pours a darker orange and golden color. Smells like sweet citrus. Taste the honey for sure. Nice and thick mouthfeel. Super hoppy. Delicious. Lucky to have had this one the last two years. Another world class beer from Bell's."
"Golden orange with lacing. Faint and pine citrus on the nose with noticeable honey. Sticky sweet. Good malt flavor. Will want to try again with a fresher bottle. Think it was missing some of the intended hop punch."
""
""
"The color is the best thing about this brew -- an intense gold. Smells tropical. Easy to drink. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer looks like summer.  Always a nice treet when hopslam comes out to break up the snowy months but I've always kind of wished bell's would switch around hopslam and oracle on the release schedule.  Smells like pine, peaches, citrus, and honey.  Tastes of fresh floral hops, stone fuits, pine, and honey.  Drinks incredibly balanced and smooth and there is just of malty honey sweetness to balance out the bold hop profile but not get sticky sweet or syrupy.  Crisp, refreshing, and super drinkable for a 10% hopbomb."
"A great DIPA. Very well balanced and enjoyable. Not the best I've had, but far from the worst. I'd probably pick up a 6 pack if I could find one."
""
""
"Unfortuately i've had this beer on two different occasions, one incredibly fresh, one not so much, both disappointed.  This beer just hasn't had the the flavor to stack up against other great DIPAS.  Very drinkable though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Never poured into a glass so idk about look. Who cares about look anyway. This is just some immaculate...erm...stuff. Last year I held this in very regard, challenging the best of the best. Made it a point to secure a case this time. I've never had it's like. Call it a double ipa or whatever, the sweetness of honey makes this beer shine. February is a great time for those of us who look for non-winter-warmers, and hopslam is just that. Can't wait til july to have one outside. A question I always ask to beer folks is...'if you were on death row, and got to pick your last meal and the beer to go along with it, what would that beer be?' KBS, heady, etc. are the typical responses. Give me Hopslam. It is my #1."
""

"Totally worth the 20 bucks for a 6 pack!"

"Clear, orange color pours with three fingers of head into a tulip glass. Nose bursts with pineapple, tangerine, honey, and pine. Taste is sweet citrus and honey up front with a bitter hoppy backbone and boozey finish. Mouth feel is sticky sweet syrup. I really enjoy the sweet, malty fruit character of this one, but I lose that a bit on the finish. As it warms the carbonation fades and the malt starts to overpower the hops. Getting more candied sugar and warm booziness. Its lacking a little in hop bitterness, but a really nice sweet IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flat. May not be normal, but mine did not look good in the glass. Taste was too sweet. Mouth feel, again...flat. Thick and heavy... not enjoyable."
""
"For now, I'll just say this is one of my favorite DIPAs."
""""Outlier detected. Justify a rating""""
"I didn't get the honey and I felt like the hops overpowered the citrus. This was still really good, but not my favorite."
""
""
""
"Had a bottle at JP Henley's, oh my god, everything I could have imagined and more.  This one very much lives up to the hype for me"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is very sweet and boozy. Too much alcohol taste and too sweet for a dipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Intriguing scent. I don't want to say I smell the honey, but there's an odd sweetness that is not familar to me. Smells more barleywine-ish than DIPA-ish. Mouthfeel is its strongest quality. Dense and oily. Feels big. Taste is a bit of a puzzle for me. Not typical for a DIPA. Piney hops on the opening but a great deal on honeyed sweetness on the end. I really like it but feel like it gravitates toward an American style barleywine, which isn't a criticism. Overall, I can see why this gets so much hype, it's a great beer, but perhaps not as mindblowing as you would be led to expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good beer, good version of a classic IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy light copper with little head. Suprisingly malty at the nose. Very piney and resiny with a nice balance of bitterness and sweet. A+."
""
""
""
""
"Bitter without body. Piney without character. Underwhelming to be nice. Can't judge fairly being from SoCal with everything else we have access to, but you can tell t's an attempt at being something it aspires to be. Hopslam is overhyped and glorified Stone IPA...maybe even closer to a Sierra Nevada pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"Taste begins with crisp lime among bready malts, while the beer drinks very smooth. A vivid kiwi prickling gets added to the taste, as well as more lime and sunny, louche grapefruit. Honey is certainly noteable, while the alcohol is not detectable at all, and it provides the fruity hops with a ripe, sappy note, as it leads the malt flavor closer to the hops by adding a striking biscuity quality to them. The beer doesn't turn sweet though, it is still centered around the hoppiness, which is yet evolving on the palate. A distinct, slick bitterness arises from the fruitiness, leading to a slightly dry, long lasting finish, continously using the hops as center of attraction, exhibiting a slightly piney note, blending smooth into the sapful fruits. The carbonation still adds a slightly refreshing impression, while the beer is heavier bodied, without loosing its typical IPA drinkability, ending with a unique honeyed, hoppy finish."
""
""
"Sweetness from the honey, and a punch from the hops makes this one of my annual favorites. If your a hop head this is a must for you to sample."
""
"Whole different beer on tap. Most things are, but the discrepancy here is amazing"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer.  I'm glad to finally have had it.  I just wish some more of the citrus flavors would come out.  They got blown away buy the piney hop notes at the finish and as the beer warmed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but entirely overwhelming.  Needs a little more malt to bring some balance to all of the hops.  Not worth the hype"
""
""
""
"I had this on tap tonight,and everything checked the boxes except for the high ABV. Great beer thought.Must Try!"
""

"The hype train with Hopslam may have run off the rails, or perhaps it has simply been eclipsed in recent years by the ubiquity of fantastic DIPAs (and even TIPAs).  However, it is a very, very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good beer but doesn't quite live up to all the hype."
""
""
""
""
"Expensive but MAYBE worth it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Doesn't live up to the hype, stone brewing enjoy by 3.14.15 blew it out of the water, however it is a delightful beer. I will drink it again next year because it is plentiful around me, but I will not go out of my way for it."
"Kind of expensive, but worth getting a sixer when in season."
""

"Well done!!"

"Very clear and well filtered.   Beautiful flavor.  Very light for such a high alcohol %"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"A good ipa, just not for me. Im beginning to see Im partial to west coast ipas. The aroma was heavenly though!"
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Quaffable, ABV well-hidden."
""
""
""
""
"Good but not the best. It smells better then it taste. It feels a little chalky on the mouth"
""
""
""
"I have had this beer for the past three releases 2013,2014,2015 from cable beverages in Bardonia New York. And i must say after drinking atleast 300 different ipa's in the past 3 years that this beer is completly over hyped. Yes its a solid dipa they hide the alchohol but there is something missing maybe it lacks a floral nose and a nice citrusy flavor but in my opinion i have had no name dipas better than this beer. For example the beer is just bitter nothing else not alot of malt to balance i think pliney the elder and heady put this beer to shame."
""
""
""
""
""

"Love the strong hoppy taste.  Very fragrant in a great way."
"Overall – 95 (World-class): I rank this imperial IPA in the same tier as Alchemist’s Heady Topper, Russian River’s Pliny The Elder, and Lawson’s Double Sunshine. At first, I was a little skeptical when the label indicated that the beer was brewed with honey, which is not typical for an IPA. After only a few swigs it became quite clear that the sweetness was what distinguished Hopslam from its predecessors and made me thoroughly appreciate this brew. I want to thank the folks at Green’s Beverages who provided me with daily updates from their Twitter page."
""
""
""
"Suprisingly smooth. It went down a little too fast, it left me wanting more at the end of the glass. Great beer"
"Not as much hops as you'd expect given the moniker.  Most of it comes in at the end with a lingering grapefruit bitter, though by no means something that is abrasive.  Upfront you get mostly the sweet honey and candy flavor, even some burnt sugar leading into the fuller hop profile at the end.  One of the easiest to drink double IPAs."
""
"Every bit as good as I expected after waiting six years to get my hands on one. Cheers"
""
"Grabbed a 6-pack of this from local Safeway; cases were just stacked on the floor between the fish and dairy coolers.  The beer poured a very nice, brilliant copper hue with slight haze.  Smell is a nice blend of citrus with no hint of the alcohol bite; slight hop presence.  Mouthfeel is wonderful, full impression.  The taste is an interesting transition from citrus, to malty, honey, then to Vidalia onion, and finally to lingering blend of honey and hop bitterness.  I think this might be the fullest spectrum of flavors across one beer that I have encountered to date.  You certainly don't sense the 10% that will hit you full steam about 3/4 of the way through the glass.  I love me some DFH 120 minute IPA, but for the price, I think this is the winner."
""
"Despite the hype, I buy a case each spring when I can. Yes, it's pricey, but once a year is good for me. One of my favs"
""
"Hides the ABV well.  Great smell.  Nice sweet finish.  Overall an outstanding DIPA that I will enjoy time after time, whenever I can get it."
"Not bad. Def not worth rushing to the store before it is sold out. Solid but Overhyped"
""
"Way too sweet for my liking. It's not a bad beer, but it's nothing special. I would much prefer to drink the local DIPA's around VA/MD/DC then this. Maybe if the price comes down it will taste better."
""
"This is an amazing ale. However, do I think its worth the hype no not one bit. Its has an amazing feel and the taste is great. but i really want more honey in the taste. I think you get that honey thickness and warmth in the feel but not in the taste. It looks like any IPA, idk why its even a qualifier. Smelled like an IPA."
""
"Such a smooth DIPA. For 10% it's crazy easy to drink.  Not the flavor explosion that the other highly rated doubles are but I'll gladly drink this again.. and again... and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow."
""
""
""
"Clear light amber in color. Slight honey in the aroma along with fairly heavy malt and a touch of booze. Nice balance of slightly bitter pine hoppiness and malt, the honey definetely brings the sweetness out a bit more. The body is medium with little carbonation. The bitterness lingers for a fair amount of time which is quite nice."
"Pleasant to drink, however, not what I was expecting based off of the high demand.  Taking into account the price, I can't see myself searching this beer out to drink again."
""
""
""
"Most over rated beer in the us"
""
""
"Bright golden beer with a thin head, sits in the glass with a bright shine waiting to be drank.  Light, crisp, sweet body.  Taste of fresh lemon grass, honey comb, butterscotch, pine, and orange peel.  Alcohol is present on the nose but the smooth taste covers it nicely."
""
""
""
"worth the hype for sure"
""
""
"I tried a glass up at a friends cabin this weekend and can say that I would not change a single thing about this beer. Looks beautiful in a glass; I could smell it all day; and it has a perfect balance of sharp, hoppy bitterness and delicate """nectar of the gods""" sweetness. Would definitely drink another glass of this liquid gold...in fact, maybe I will today. Thanks again Berg77 for the gift!"
"Yes, people will say this beer is overhyped. Maybe so. However, this is a very well balanced DIPA. Honey gives it a nice balance. Definitely worth seaking out once a year."
""
""
"Well balanced for a DIPA, still not my cup of tea."
"Finally got ahold of some thanks to a buddy. It was good but didn't come close to the hype for me."
""
""
""
""
"Best I grav IPA I've had. Thick mouthfeel and a sweet finish. Very unique!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden in color with maybe a half inch of head.  Good lacing around the glass. Smells like citrus, grapefruit and some pine.  Taste is grapefruit up front with sweetness in the middle and a hoppy finish.  Mouthful is medium with decent carbonation and a bit of oil.  Overall it is a really nice dipa. The hype around this beer is probably overstepped some which drives the price but it is worth trying at least once."
"Wow the balance and that hit of honey at the end! A must try and worth the effort in purchasing."
""
""
"Amazing. This may be my favorite beer this side of Pliny the Elder.  It is hoppy but not just for the sake of hops a good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely splendid brew. Beautifully balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts with a hoppy, bouncy, sweet, and bitter grapefruit. It has a slight, slick malt middle rounding into sweet orange and mango mouth coating. Complex flavors continue to bounce around the palate - very lively and delicious."
""
"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Hazy orange liquid topped by a finger of ivory head that settles to a clingy ring. Streaks and dots of lacing are left behind. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit, bread, citrus zest, a bit of honey and some alcohol. Taste follows the nose, with a beautiful sweetness up front that is abruptly replaced by a mellow lingering bitterness and some wafting booziness. On the full side of medium body, creamy but sadly not as sticky as I’d have liked, medium foamy carbonation, drying and boozy on the finish."
""
""
""
"Not sure about the hype...that being said, this is a very good IPA! Having followed a Stone collaboration Green Tea IPA, I honestly can't tell much difference in taste. But then again, what does that tell ya?! It tells me Hop Slam is on-par with the best-of-the-best!"
""
""
""
"I use to LOVE east cost style IPA's. While they are way more balanced than their counterparts, they are just so thick! The beer boasts extreme hoppiness. I think if the malt was tamed down, this would be more present. However, for the style, it is very good! I understand why this is the OG of the IPA world. I pair it with a grilled whole fish with lemon and capers. I give it a 93.6/100."
""
"Overall:  Quite a good beer that lives up to it's reputation."
""
""
"This lived up to the hype for me. Bottled 1/10/15.   Into the Spiegelau a clear, golden, super carbed beauty with a finger of pure, white head. Could smell it from the table. Bright astringent pine, grapefruit, solid nose, but not overpowering. Hint of honey and booziness after awhile. Sweet on the front of the tongue, followed by solid pine in the middle and a classic, big bitterness towards the end... mellowing into a nice honey sweetness. Grapefruit/citrus came out a bit more for me as the glass warmed up. Solid mouthfeel, refreshing but not run of the mill... I expect that the honey added some of this aspect. Totally worth the hype. Our great local bottle shop held us a few. Well worth a trip, and a try. Exceeded expectations."
""
"2015 bottled January 10. (Better than last year.)"
"why is this $17 a six pack got lucky and got this in a Kroger Pick 6 I think nugget nectar is better"
"Not a bad beer and it is very smooth.  It's just way to sweet for me, especially compared to the far superior IPAs and DIPAs on the market now.  Overhyped..."
"Loved everything about this beer.  I'll be tracking it yearly."
""
""
""
"Had it on tap yesterday.  One of the best.   One of the original """crazy hop""" beers.  But, it isn't piney or grapefruit-y or other sometimes too intense hopped-up flavors.  The honey is there, and the hops have an actually kind of cool and mellow flavor considering the name.  A thick, nearly syrupy brew with fine carbonation.  Beautiful flavor.  Excellent.  I have had it bottled, but the tap is the way to go, less foamy and more silky."
"Lived up to the hype. Just not as much as I expected"
""
""
"I'll preface this by saying that I don't usually like sweet IPAs. Now that I've said that this stuff was delicious and well worth the purchase. It doesn't crack my short list of favorite DIPAs, but it's close and I can't wait to finish off the six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best beer of 2015, so far"
"Is it literally the best beer ever? No. Is it worth the hype? Yep. Well worth getting if it's practical for you. Kinda reminds me of an even better Jai Alai, but with honey instead of hints of orange."

"overall:  nicely built.  great (and somewhat unique) kind of bittness.  a sipper."
"Nothing wrong with the nose; piney and almost mango-ey, like the best WC IPAs I've tried. Honey immediately noticeable in taste and texture. Unlike any IPA I've tried, honestly, but reminds me of the fruitier SD IPAs I've tasted (without going malty). Can't quite put my finger on the aftertaste; almost tart, but not infection. Like a DFH90 w/o the malt. Booze definitely present in nose and taste as it warms. Piney but sticky sweet; wouldn't go so far as to call it resinous like a Rip Current signature, though. Glad I finally got to try... Not quite the IPA the 100 rating led me to expect, but an awesome, fun (dangerous, shareable) beer that isn't anywhere close to what """HypeSlam""" claims had me worried it could be. All in all, a great beer, and a good IPA."
""
""
""
"Smoother than previous years. Dat lace doe"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- A great interpretation of the style that remains strong in its hoppiness without hitting palate wrecking degrees.  ABV strength makes it a definite sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I thought it lives up to the hype and name but the $25 price for a six-pack is ridiculous. They had plenty and no purchase limit. I'll buy another 6 on next years release but not worth the price if you ask me."

"A wonderful experience. Top notch IPA!"
"O - A really good IPA.  Recommended!  Cheers!"
""
""
"If it gets better than this, lead me to It! Taste and feel are incredible smooth and the smell is spot on. Cannot say enough good things."
""
""
"All I can say is Wow.  Great overall IPA. Just hoppy enough without going overboard. Just enough citrus without making you feel like you're sucking on a grapefruit.  Good color. One finger head.  Worth the wait. Glad I got my hands on some this time around. Some say a little pricey, but compared to domestic beer at a bar, I'll take this all day long."
"P.S.  I also feel that with a $3.50 price tag per bottle this was my last """Hopslam"""."
""
""
""
"It's smooth sweet and bitter. Very well balanced and the honey notes add so much to the overall experience. I was worried that at 10 abv there would be a harsher bite/warmth that I've wasn't a fan of with some other IPA's like Stones Enjoy By double IPA but that wasn't the case. I wish they brewed this year round."
"Very good IPA, easy drink ability, hard to get and expensive ($25), worth it, if you can get your hands on it."
""
""
""
"Everything it's suppose to be. It is what I thought it would be. Go ahead and SLAM one!!"
"Really, an excellent beer. Not the powerful citrus aroma I've come to expected from the Two Hearted IPA, and the honey takes a slice out of the piney hops as well. These aren't exactly complaints, either. Great change of pace. I've had a bottle and draft pint in both Traverse City and San Diego, and I'm happy to report the beer met Bell's standard of quality in both parts of the country."
"All aboard, next stop hypeville.  I wanted so badly to love this beer, I absolutely love bells.  The color and aroma were nice, but for my personal taste the hop profile did not support the maltiness that was present.  I expect some sweetness and malt given the abv but not at the expense of the hops.  Oh well, still glad I was able to try it."
"O - Always tough to live up to the hype/expectations, seeing the ratings, the forum talk, etc..beforehand.   I will say I was impressed, mainly about the balance, aroma,  and that it stayed consistent through the whole glass. Certainly well made and worth a try."
""
"Perfectly balanced double IPA . A must try if your able to get it . At 18$ for a six pack ..... Worth every penny!!!"
""
""
"This beer really lives up to the hype and it's certainly worth the price. I'll be buying a couple more 6 packs in the coming weeks."
""
""
"There's a lot of hype about this beer.  A slight let down.  However the feel is great, still a bitter IPA worth drinking"
"Tried this about a week afte bottling And my God was is delicious. Tons of resin and citrus just the way a DIPA should be. This might be my favorite DIPA."
""
"Worth. Every. Penny. The smell is hoppy and has a slight tinge of alcohol to it, with a minute amount of fruitiness. The taste is very bitter then it dissipates quickly, leaving you with a fruity (grapefruit-esque?) flavor that dies down into a biscuity sort of taste. The back end is a nice warming sensation of alcohol, but not strong. Subtle, to the point where it's most enjoyable. I am not sure I could drink more than 2 of these a session, but I'll for sure get it again. I just may tomorrow, to stash away for the summer."

"Great beer. Slight citrus at the front of the palate with a full thick malt driven mouthfeel and finishes floral and piney. Overall i  really enjoyed it; however I did find it to be slightly cloying. I wasn't expecting such a heavy malt presence in an IPA. My local distributors get very little and limit sales to one bottle per customer. This is the first year I was able to get my hands on it and scored two bottles from two different stores for $10. It's tasty but not worth the hype there are plenty of other shelf DIPAs that I enjoyed more."
""
""
""
"You must love Hops to appreciate beer, of thats your thing then this beer is for you!"
"Too sweet and not as happy as I thought.  Good, not great"
""
""
"Quite good. I had this for the first time last year, as i was just starting to explore IPAs. It was too hoppy for me then, but I'm able to appreciate it much more now. The question is always whether it's worth all the hype. To some it is. Overall, I do like this beer, but I can get the same or more enjoyment from some beers that are less expensive. It is definitely a nice treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O (4.25) - Overall a solid beer.  I haven't had this one before, and it was (obviously) hyped for me.  But it did not fall short.  It is too expensive for what it is, but I still enjoy it."
""
"This beer is definitely overrated."
""
""
"Very crisp and slightly sweet DIPA. Not what I was expecting but it's good. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. Taste is honey and caramel malts with light hoppy notes coming through in a resinous finish. Not as hop-forward as I would have expected. Very good but if I want a DIPA this usually isn't what I would reach for. Still good and very drinkable. Not worth the crazy hype though."
""
""
""
"i think what this comes down to is the west coast vs east coast iipa thing. this beer, in my book, is the best example of an east coast iipa. the hops may star in the west coast version, but the malt plays a much bigger role here as compared to a west coast iipa. the hops are big, piney and resinous. but the malt is sweet with a huge mouthfeel and just delicious. i love both styles, but this is one of the best."
""

"Overall - Awesome beer to try, they do a good job of striking a balance here w/ the hops still taking center stage and extremely powerful. Love the sweet contrast. Excellent, excellent beer."
""
""
""
"A great DIPA, lives up to the hype. Very refined, not in your face tart like many IPAs. Has a lingering sweetness from the honey. Very smooth consistency with fine carbonation like a great champagne. Bouquet is very fresh, but not very floral, and aroma is not the highlight of this one. But the taste is so smooth I can't believe its 10% abv. Very impressive beer and you can just tell the quality is special."

"I had this once or twice last year, but my first of this year was much better than I expected or remembered. Booze is completely hidden for such an ass-kicker, smell is sweet and citrusy in the bottle.  Taste is balanced with hints of honey and a smooth finish.  Really this is a superb brew and I wish it was just a little easier to track down in NY (I've scrambled around to 3 or 4 places this week to grab 5 bottles - hopefully more coming soon. A buddy of mine was able to grab a 6 pack but most stores are selling them 1 or 2 bottles at a time). Worth the effort once a year!"
""
""
"When I read """made with honey""" I expected a sweet, heavy drink. What I got was a well rounded crisp flavor that was light on the tongue. The honey accented the hops exquisitely creating a balanced flavor with a nice slightly sweet, citrus flavor, without an overpowering after taste."

"As opposed to the fruity double IPAs of the West Coast (particularly California) the genius of this beer is not IMMEDIATELY apparent. At first, yes it is good, a lot of bitterness up front, sweet from the honey and the malt. As it warms (and I would advise to drink this from the start at room temperature. Don't even chill it slightly) so much pops! The fruit is pineapple and it appears at the back end of the taste like right before the beer goes down my throat. And then it stays and says what's up! Then from there, yes GENIUS. It's like I'm listening to a symphony and hearing for the first time all of the intricate parts and timbres. Same with this beer. It's like an intellectual beer. I'm constantly thinking about what I'm tasting and what flavor combinations are there. Highly recommend for those that appreciate the more subtle things in a German beer. This might be the Double IPA for you. Worth the hype."

"Just got  4 and I can't wait to finish them. Love  it"

"Smells like hoppy citrus goodness. But the taste isn't anything like the smell. Initial taste is hoppy with a hint of over ripe loquats. For being 10%, the alcohol is well hidden. I don't really know what the hype is about but it's good, not world class but good"
""
""
""
""
""
"Apricot/amber, very clear. Boozy, sweet DIPA with some alcohol heat balanced nicely by very piney hops. It's not a crushable beer, meant to be sipped clearly. Reminds me a bit of Sixpoint Resin. I enjoyed it quite a bit, even though I tend to like cleaner malt profiles and less booze in my IPAs. Glad I sought it out."
""
""
""
"Well worth the wait and hunt of finding it."
"This beer was pretty good."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a medium amber in with a half inch head that dissipates quicker than expected.  Very sweet floral nose with notes of honey, light vanilla, and mild hops.  Taste is refreshing  piney hops with honey and bright citrus. Nice balance overall and very drinkable. One of the better offerings by Bell's"
"Best double IPA I've had. Refreshing and with no alcohol bite, it's very drinkable for 10% ABV. The sweetness of the honey comes trough in the finish without being overpowering. Extremely well-balanced. I'll be looking for more."

"Landed one six pack last year, but with some additional legwork and recon I landed 15 bottles this year. This is truly one of the Godfathers of craft beer. What's so awesome about this beer? It's not the most hoppy or bitter, but it is fucking unique. Does not really taste like anything else I have had. Funny, when u bought this brew it looked very clear. After two days in my fridge it poured a beautiful cloudy golden. I taste the honey for sure. Phenominal shit."
""
"It was okay, don't think it lived up to its hype"
""
""
"O: Overall, I have had many beers since the first time I had this beer.  Still to this day, I'll buy a hopslam over anything else i see.  A 6nr in Indiana will set you back about $14.00. I've paid more to be disappointed in the past, I genuinely love this beer! Big ups to Bells on this one.."

"O: though nothing could live up to the hype surrounding this beer this is pretty damn close, it is downright delicious, subtly warming and honestly has just about everything you could want in an IPA, I would say this though if you are concerned about the money, you could live without trying this beer, just get sculpin from ballast point, it kinda feels like the bargain cousin to this beer"
""
""
""

"The World Class flavor profile is quite intense, very complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a slam of grapefruit that slowly takes on a pine character.  As the hop flavor fades, the rich biscuit and honey sweetness comes to the forefront.  In the middle, a mild bitterness takes the lead.  A blend of the above slowly fade and jostle for prominence going into the finish. The finish is a slow fade of honey over pine bitterness, with grapefruit notes quite evident, and just a touch of alcohol flavor.  The alcohol coverage is simply a brewing masterpiece."
""
""
""
"This beer is the perfect balance of hops/malt, with a name like hop slam I was scared that it would be way to """hoppy""" but the beer itself tasted amazing. At 5.99 a bottle... It's not worth it, but definitely a great beer."

""

"So smooth with great hops!"

"Not worth the Hype. Had high expectations, but was underwhelmed. It did a good job at hiding the 10% ABV, but that was it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had the chance to try it both on bottle and on tap at Bells on the same day. It's markedly better fresh on tap, the nose has distinct citrus & tropical notes. Some of that nose was lost in the bottle and the malt sweetness and the bitterness dominated. Still, a good beer nonetheless. Felt like the 2014 batch was better though."
"First time distribution this year in San Diego, CA.  Seond time trying.  I honestly do not understand the hype on this beer.  It is mediocre at best.  No hop nose to speak of and a cloyingly sweet finish.  It DOES have a nice appearance. Had a Bear Republic Apex immediatly after and it blew it away.  There are so many more easily attainable beers out here in Californa that leave this in the dust."
"One of the best finishing beers around."
""
""
""
""
"Dark Amber tinged orange color with a quick fading white head that leaves some spotty lacing.  Grapefruit fills the aroma with some sweetness, floral and booze.  Taste is bitter red grapefruit with a touch of honey adding some floral character and a sweet but unobtrusive malt bill.  Resinous and light pine in the finish.  Nicely carbonated gives a pleasant prickle and helps the bitter edge and finishes semi dry. This was great but far from the best DIPA I've had and not quite up to the big hype surrounding it."
""
""
""
"Bronze color. Huge foam upon pour that fades quickly. Smells dank and like grapefruit. Similar flavor that lingers. Very good!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I like strong beer that hides the ABV and this one is as good as any. Smells and tastes like its namesake, but less boozy and less sweet than the honey and ABV would lead you to believe. One of the best IPAs out there."
""
"Very enjoyable, not worth the hype"
""
""
"Bottled 1/9/15. Hops are strong and the honey is there and so is the alcohol. A little strong for my tastes but like all Bell products it is exactly as advertised. Beautifully crafted and not for the faint-hearted!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't know why this is hyped as there are lots of better, more available IPAs but it's pretty good , most expensive sixer I've bought. Will drink and enjoy them but won't buy again when there's so much better out there (for cheaper )"
"Very decent DIPA and good example of style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: From pour to finish it seemed to last maybe 10 min. Is it allowable to make a 10% DIPA so damn drinkable? Yes! The mark of any good beer is your desire for its next drink, and this one is pure lust from a hopheads perspective. Its a different beer from the start to the finish, and as my comrade finshed one swallow before myself, and he said, """Damn, that was delicious.""" I think that sums it up perfectly."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite DIPAs, and the beer that sent me spiraling into craft-beer madness 2 years ago. Hopslam is phenomenal even 3-4 weeks after bottling, but the fresher you can find it the better. Those bitter, biting, and dank flavors you get with an ultra-fresh bottle are about as good as it gets in the DIPA realm."
""
""
""
""
"Beauty, thy name is Hopslam."
""
""
"Overall this was a very good IPAs. I'm not a very big IPA fan, but I figured a beer of this level of notoriety deserved a review. In my opinion, the beer is good, but doesn't really seem like anything that special to me. Not sure why all the hype, but regardless, glad to enjoy a good beer."
""
"Served on tap; appearance- beautiful frothy head, excellent retention. Smell- hop, hop, more hop. Some citrus. Taste- as advertised, plenty of hops with some nice honey balance, finishes with grapefruit. Mouthfeel- this defines this beer. Very smooth and easy drinking, you completely forget the ABV and the alcohol is hidden. Overall- an excellent, solid dipa, falls slightly short of the hype, but nevertheless has one of the best mouth feels I can remember for a dipa."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/8/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with good strength. Some light booziness shows up as it warms. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, apricot, lemon/orange zest, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and robustness of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"An excellent hoppy DIPA that does have some sweetness and malt balance.  Only a trace amount of bitterness.  Fairly easy drinking as well which could get you in trouble with the 10% abv."

"I've had the 2013, 2014 and now 2015... I think I like the 2015 much better than 2014 and little better than 2013 (from what I can remember freshly having in 2013).  I didn't really enjoy last years version, this one seems smoother and more refreshing than last years.  Would recommend trying.  As beer starts to warm up the honey flavor really kicks in."
"One word.....Amazing!  A hop heads dream......this is a treat!"
""
""
""
"O- An amazing beer that is worthy of hype and one every hop head should try at least once. The honey adds a dimension to it that others do not have, for me I find it takes away slightly from the hops but it still works, it just might not be everyone's cup of tea. Another thing I have found is that this beer is really best within the first couple of week from bottling. I find the alcohol can become more present at about a month, it's the same problem I have with Oracle as well. But the aroma of this beer is up there with all the others, very bright and a definite slam in your face."
""
"Ok-it's rare. As a Michigander we look forward to getting it. All I can say is it's emotionally and tastefully- quenching."
""
""
"One of the best IPAs I've ever tasted."
""
""
""
"Awesome! Just awesome. Best smelling beer I have tried. One of the best tasting to boot. Citrus, and especially grapefruit, to me, give this beer a fantastic aroma, and leaves a more than pleasant taste on the palette. Most likely due to the added honey,  the bit of sweetness balances the bitterness well. Fantastic beer."

"The absolute perfect example of a double IPA. honestly, this could very well qualify as a double or 3 en triple IPA. It IS SO DAMN hoppy!!! In the best way possible. It's extremely bitter and piney; if you love ipa's like I do, this isn't a bad thing. I've had far too many ipa and double and triple ipa beers that are way too sweet like southern tier. This takes the cake :) I bought two cases and don't regret it."

"From a freshly tapped keg, hops, hops, hops in the aroma and flavor balanced with liberal malt and alcohol. As the keg ages the hops die down and the malt moves forward. Find a fresh keg and drink your fill. Its a beautiful beer - brilliant gold, medium body, medium carbonation."

"Hands down one of my top 5 favorite beers. Not necessarily a huge fan of X2 IPA's but this double will always be at the top of my list. Beautiful and rich in it's golden color with an aroma hand crafted in hop heaven. The honey in this beer is what makes it so memorable. Very well balanced in it's citrus notes and definitely not as strong as it's percentage hints that it should be. Not such a popular beer in the south, but when it is around it never lasts long. Another score for Bells Brewery!"

"Finally get to try this one. Have been looking forward to it for awhile. Golden hazy color. One inch fluffy head. Malty sweet aroma hits you first. Then the hop smell comes through. The flavor of this is very well balanced. Grapefruit, caramel, hops. The honey makes a nice touch of sweetness.This is a very good beer. Only complaint is it is just a touch too sweet. I would like a little more of the fruit to come through and a little less sweetness, then I’d give it a 5."

"Let me just start off by saying this beer is pretty good. The reason for the 1/5 rating is because this beer should not be a 100 or anywhere close to that. High 80s to low 90s at best.  Bell's seems to be one of the most overrated breweries around and this beer is no exception. A pretty average DIPA with an unnecessary sweetness from the honey."

"Final Word: One of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had, especially considering that it is a Double IPA! Bell’s says that this brew has the most complex hopping schedule of anything they produce, and it shows in the amazing variety of hop flavors and aromas experienced here. In most beers this high use of hops would translate to the final product being overwhelmingly bitter and dry, but Bell’s wisely balanced the profile with sweet, nutty malts, and honey. As I drank this beer I kept feeling that the honey’s texture and flavor was the glue that holds this beer together; it bridges the gap between the resiny hops and the nutty malts, while lending a grounding sweetness to the entire profile. The only complaint I had was that the higher ABV made itself known every once in a while by coming up in the flavor, but this still doesn’t taste like a 10% ABV beer. While folks new to craft beer might still find the hop character a little overwhelming, this is absolutely a brew that everyone should try if given the chance. This sets the bar very high for IPAs everywhere!"

"This is just a fantastic IIPA, there really isn't much more to be said that hasn't already. If you like Two Hearted then you cannot go wrong here. The only drawback is the price (I paid $17.99 for my six pack) but this nectar is still worth splurging for once or twice a year."

"I can't get over how great the honey balances out the hops. In a good way... Makes for a sweet, easy drinking DIPA. Unreal at 10%. It's thick and creamy. I tend to like my IPA's more dry and crisp. I still have to say it's slightly overrated, mostly due to hype though. That's not Bells fault, so I won't knock it. I don't believe it should be flying off shelves at near $20 a 6'er. On that note. It's 'supply and demand' and I will seek out what I can. Hopslam is perhaps the smoothest IPA on the market~"

"Overall: Although Hopslam is abundant in my area, it has slipped through the cracks for a couple years. I have to say it does live up to the hype and is on another level from other great DIPAs iv had. It's superbly balanced with bright fruit, pine, honey, and sweet malt characteristics. Making it even better, I found $3 bottles at my local mix n match bar and walked out with a cheaper six pack than most ($18). Compared to other beers iv had in the same style, its slightly better than Dirtwolf and Double Trouble IMO and on par with Sucks and Head Hunter, but not quite up there with my favorite DIPA right now, Enjoy By. Although an outstanding beer, I think the limited release hypes this beer up more than it should be"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As the beer ages, the hop bitterness dissipates quite a bit, and becomes much more pleasant in my opinion. However, since most IPA's are meant to be enjoyed fresh, I must rate this based on the fresh bottle."

"O: A nice DIPA to be sure, but I am still not certain that I understand or appreciate the furor that surrounds this beer's yearly release. It is definitely good, perhaps even very good for the style, but I have had ales of this style that are better balanced, more readily available, less expensive, more approachable, and that present a better, more sophisticated integration of bold hop and succulent malt flavors. Then again, judging by the name, as well as the attitudes and preferences of the crowd drawn into Hopslam's oddly rabid and surprisingly steadily expanding cult following, this is a beer for the truly hop obsessed. As if my reviews do not make this clear, I am not one of those guys, at least not consistently. Still, I can appreciate Hopslam for what it is: a big, unbelievably aggressive DIPA for the legion of self-professed hopheads inhabiting the netherworld of American craft beer geekdom."
""
"O - This is just a great beer. The flavors are complex enough that you don't even notice the 10% ABV (not sure that's a good thing). This is one highly rated beer that shouldn't disappoint anyone who likes a good DIPA."
""
""
""
"O- It's a very drinkable and balanced DIPA I must admit. I used to never like IPAs, but I am really starting to enjoy them now. This is a great DIPA if you can get your hands on it. BUT IF YOU CAN'T, DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MISSING OUT. This beer (at least this years Hopslam) is not worth $20 for a 6pk. I lean towards the less sweet, more hoppy, piney, and citrusy IPAs (Victory Dirtwolf and Great Lakes Chillwave for example) and this 2014 Hopslam didn't quite make me fall in love with it. If I can get next years bottle I would be very happy, but if not, that's fine. There are thousands of more beers worth a $20 price tag more than Hopslam."

"Obviously a very hoppy beer. Can smell and taste the hops instantly. Opaque golden in color with a good size head. Hints of both citrus and wheat could be tasted in this beer. Very high alcohol content, but almost can't taste it due to the other strong flavors. This beer was a smooth beer to drink. I enjoy hops but this beer just had too much for me."
""
"Overall: Overall, I didn't find the complexity here that I was looking for, and it didn't have the hop flavors that I was looking for (I think the honey and alcohol burn got in the way). There are so many heavily hopped beers today that this just may not be the world class beer that it once was. Anyway, my opinion is that it is very good but not world class, and it is simply not worth $17.99/six pack."

"This beer is 10%ABV. Golden clear honey in appearance. Served in a snifter. A hint of fruittiness in this beer but lives true to its name and is extremely hoppy - HOPSLAM. Drinks very smooth for a beer with 10%ABV. I would certainly reccomend this beer to any avid beer drinkers."
"When on-tap and poured, this beer has a fairly large head. If you've had Bell's Two Hearted Ale it is very similar to that, but with more of a kick. With an ABV of 10% you can definitely taste the alcohol in this beer. It is a great beer if you are looking for a high alcohol content beer"

It has a huge mouth feel without all the bitterness. The hops are huge, the citrus flavor is there & it's a huge DIPA!!! I LOVE the Oracle but Hopslam is hands down one of, if not the BEST DIPA's out there!!!"

Smell is a bit of citrus but you can't avoid tears from the hoppiness(good thing). Taste almost mimics the smell extremely hoppy finish with a citrus undertone. Sits on the tounge well. Overall a great beer and I am glad it lived up to the hype."

"Good gawd! Get dunked on by this hopslamming ale; the smell is of a hoppy meadow in the Elysian fields and the taste is similar to a bulldozer shoving a inordinate amount of pines citrus hops and a motley of other refreshing ingredients onto your palate where they accommodate one another instead of duking it out."

"Light amber in color with a fairly hazy profile. A quarter inch thick off white head caps off the top. Brussels lacing. Aroma is an intense aroma of citrus hops with notes off mango,passion fruit and pineapple. The mouth is very sticky and dry. There's an intense rush of citrus hops that doesn't let up. The light malt backbone does keep things from getting out of hand. The fade still has an intense citrus hop burn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I get a hop slam of aroma—just a blast of hops. First whiff set the stage for the floral, vibrant, zesty, hoppy goodness. Hook this up to an oxygen tank and let me breath it in! Flavor combination of some tropical fruits, lots of citrus, and a bit of a chewiness to keep it interesting. I found a big malt backing to balance out the scales and a dry finish that kept me begging for more, more, more! I sipped and I sipped and I decimated my palate with hop bitterness. Hopslam! (Exclamation point!)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy amber with a half finger of white head that sticks around for a while. The nose is huge on orange, but also includes lemon peel, tangerine, pineapple, and sweet malts. I get a pine needle taste up front before the bitterness is reduced by sweet orange, papaya, and pineapple, and then washed away completely by bready malts, leading to an impressively balanced and coherent experience from the beginning of the tongue to the end. Drinks smooth with a medium body, and hides the alcohol content well."
""
""
""
""
"Expectation failed to become reality. I've heard over the years it has gone down hill. With a name like Hopslam I expect to be slapped in the face with hops. It was very mediocre in that department. I got 2 bottles through trades. 1 FRESH and 1 aged a year. The aged one was more pleasant to drink as a complex 10% beer. The FRESH one was just not worth what I heard they sell for upwards of $20 a six pack (or more). Too many better beers out there to waste that kind of money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had it from the bottle, from a snifter, a pint glass, a tulip glass, and I would drink it out of a paper cup if I had to. It pours a misty golden color, with a minimal head that quickly dwindles to a faint spiderweb. Smelling brings some hops, but again, a touch of sweet honey to smooth it out. Just the right amount of carbonation, and the mouthfeel is like a light syrup. It tastes magical, the Platonic ideal of a honey-brewed IPA, imperial or otherwise. But that sweet touch really distinguishes it, making it incomparable, to my mind, with some of the other great imperial pales I've had - Heady Topper, Abrasive, Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer Wolf. Highly recommended, but drink it fresh to keep as much of the hop presence as you can - if you're out of market and thinking about trading for it in 2014, do it now."
""
""
""
"Hopslam's taste is well rounded, but that wasn't what I was expecting. The alleged honey that I didn't really smell has come out to cut the hoppy character that I thought this beer would have. Anyway, this beer is still quite enjoyable. The finish is fantastic and so is the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"O: I've been holding off on this review. After all the rave reviews for Hopslam, I wanted to have some other good IPAs in between my first bottle and my review. To be fair, it was bottled in January and I got lucky, picking up a six pack that had hidden in the storage of Wegmans in early March. Probably not the freshest it could be. There are many good IPAs out there. Hopslam is no doubt one of them. However, there is a lot of hype around this beer. So much so that I feel Hypeslam is an appropriate name. I don't think it justifies the $20 price tag for a six-pack. Not when you can pick up many other IPAs of just as good quality for $11. Again, Hopslam is very good. But not for the price. Maybe if I got it on tap or closer to the source i'd feel different. Bell's Two-Hearted is almost as good, half the price and readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"taste is honey (amazing!) with some slight hop bitterness. very easy to drink (this is 10% ?!?)... some bready malt to it at the finish.... definitely NOT west coast double imperial ipa, but very very good. again, another first for me!!!"

Hopslam is a well integrated hop, booze and malt bomb with limited outstanding qualities. This is a classic and despite craft evolution it will continue to impress through reputation and respect."

"I'm thrilled with receiving Hop Slam in my first out of state trade."
"A friend picked this one up for me on a strong recommendation from my beer guru. Excellent appearance, not to thin, with a great head that clings. Smell is also outstanding. Not as much punch to the nose as some IPAs but other than that perfect. Very good taste but a little to much bitter hanging on for my taste. Surprised me when I looked up the ABV, did not seem near that strong, much easier to drink then that which gives it big bonus points overall. Overall an excellent beer that I will want to try again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: I love the smell of this DIPA. Ranks up there with the best I've had. Definitely a beer all DIPA lovers need to have once in their lifetime."

"Received in a trade, and glad I got the chance. An excellent beer overall. For me, Not the most attractive on the nose, but not unpleasant. Honey and a little citrus. Not much bitterness which would have been nice to offset the sweetness. An original tasting beer, so I score it highly in taste for originality. The 10% alcohol is mostly masked, although sometimes I feel it tastes vaguely of a fruity cocktail. One to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Didn't quite live up to the hype for me, but it is still a hell of a beer. The flavor is pretty good, I'm just not head over heels in love with it. Too much honey, maybe. Really didn't bruise my tongue as the bottle suggested, but then again my lupulin threshold is pretty high these days. Stupid drinkable. I could probably knock back 3 of these without trying and get into trouble. Good thing it ain't from 'round these here parts!"

"O - Better balanced than an all-out hop bomb, this is a big beer that's all about celebrating a variety of nuances various hops will produce, both in the nose as well as on the palette. It's expensive, but worth it if you're a fan of big and bitter. Watch out for the ABV, though; it will sneak up on you!"

"Overall: Very drinkable for 10%. Nice hop flavors. Very well put together. I would definitely go to this one pretty often if it were in my area."
"This 10% beer hides its abv well. It's a sipping beer, but each sip goes down quickly. The great mouthfeel and balance of hops and malt make this a great beer."
""
""
""
"O/D - This is legit. Lives up to the hype for sure. So flavourful, complex, and lovely to sip. Not as easy drinking as Heady Topper, but they're different styles of DIPA. Lovely in it's own right."

"I thought it presented almost perfectly, creamy off-white 3/4 head, some lacing as i go. Hazy, dense copper color, very pretty. The smell is good but not what drives the beer, musty & funky with a hint of sweetness. The taste is bitter and hoppy, no real fruit presence. Not sure if it's the honey that slightly offsets the bitterness but it works non-the-less. Overall, this a bubbly, carbonated, hoppy happy beer. Their isn't even a slight hint that it's 10%, no boozy taste or smell. Cheers."

"First look is a light amber color with some haze. Smells very inviting with with floral honey and a citrus mix - I am going to say clementine and tangelo. Taste is very sweet - very prevalent organic raw honey. Still very tasty. Apparently this years release is not up to par when compared to previous years but I still think it is a great beer!"

"I found this beer delicious, but not particularly hopped up and aggressive as I'd expect from an Imperial IPA. Still, I liked the sweetness and the berry flavor and armoa that aren't common in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"AAAHHH. Just as it always is. IPAs continue to get bigger and more extreme but this big boy stays the same. Annual treat--have enjoyed for years and never disappoints. Others may blast you harder or remove all your enamel but this one stays wonderfully drinkable. I don't know why every craft drinker wouldn't want at least one sixer."
"Nose is medium strength, more dank spectrum than fruity. Taste is sharp hoppiness, mixed dank with some fruity notes. Honey is very present, much more than I was expecting, and I don't particularly care for the sweetness it contributes. Wanted to really like this beer, but the honey and the hop profile were both disappointing. Very smooth for a 10% ABV beer, though."

"Ahh . . . Hopslam, the beer everyone loves to hate. This beer is like The New York Yankees of craft beer (you know what I mean). Smooth silky feel, great hop flavor, subtle malt and honey backbone. It's still a fantastic dipa. Stop hatin' playa !"
""
""

"O- I have had this gem a many of times and this one was a little more than a month old and it was great. Fresh is best on this one. Last year I had it 3 days after the bottle date and it was one of the best IPA's I've ever have had."
""
""
""
"O: Glad I finally got to check this one out -- it's an absolutely delicious DIPA, and thoroughly delivers on its name. The price and fervor around it may seem a bit much, but sticking strictly to the beer itself, it's a well balanced drink that shows off the immense talent of the good folks at Bell's."
""
"O - Not up there with the other highly rated IPAs per my personal tastes. Could be it's different enough from what I expect from the style that I'm not appreciating it enough, but I've had both plinys and kern citra, within the last month, a can of abrasive just before this review, and I'd drink all three of those repeatedly before having hopslam again. Bottle was dated 1/11, so probably by it's best by date. Stupid polar vortex delaying shipping. However this review seems to correspond with my remembrances from past times I've had it that it didn't blow me away, even the glass I had at the brewery, so I'm posting it. This beer has never been one of my personal favorites."

"The color was almost orange in hue, with a slight head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was fantastic! I could tell by the smell that I was in for a treat, because it wasn't overpowering in the typical way that very hoppy beers are to me, but instead gave amazing floral and citrus notes. Mouthfeel was substantial compared to a regular IPA, and I liked the body and slight malty sweetness, which quickly gave way to the hops. Whatever combo they use was enough to convert me, because it was intense and complex without the harshness of most beers with that much hops. I'm guessing a lot of late additions and dry hops. You'd also never guess this was 10% ABV. I never order IPAs or DIPAs, but from now on, when I see this on tap, that's probably what I'll get."
"Overall: Coming into this brew, I was given a lot of good opinions. Boy, were they right. If you're a hophead and love it that way, you won't be disappointed. The pour was very impressive, all the way to the finial sips. Citrus hops were very apparent in this brew and made itself well known from the beginning. I would definitely recommend to a friend and will definitely have again. Hope to find it soon on tap. Cheers!"
"O - I was a bit more impressed with Hopslam this time around. I feel it's as close to perfect as possible for an imperial IPA right now. Go get'cha some!"

"Served in a bottle. Pours clear amber with creamy head and lazy bubbles, ample lace. Aroma is of sweet flowers and sugar, first taste is nicely bitter balanced near perfectly with a honey candy sweetness that gives you a nice hint of sweetness but quickly subsides to flowery bitterness that finishes crisp with a sweet dry balance that makes your mouth water for more. Very ample on the hops without being just bitterness or flowery overtones. A delicious and quaff-able ale."

"Overall, this was a wonderful DIPA. In line with Sculpin or Gandhi Bot only BETTER! It was sticky and dank and bright and utterly delicious. WOW!"

"Overall: Such an enjoyable beer, always a welcome addition to my fridge or at my local brewery. However for the price, there are much better deals and arguably better DIPAs on the market. I believe this is an experience every craft beer nerd should have from the hunting and finding to the tasting of Hopslam, but once you've had it, there are more viable options available to you on a more regular basis. I love this beer, but I don't see me hunting it down again next year, unless it drops it's price (which is unlikely and ok.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did it live up to the hype? Not quite, but it wasn't far off. Dangerously smooth for a 10% DIPA and it's tame enough that a lot of non-hopheads could enjoy it. I like this beer a lot, and would never turn one down. But it's just a notch below my favorites, and for the price, I feel there are much better values to be had."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a must try DIPA. Drinks incredibly easy at 10% and can be extremely dangerous. Alcohol makes no appearance. Amazingly juicy with both citrus and tropical fruits. The honey adds the perfect balance to this brew. This is Bell's masterpiece."
""
""
""
"Best beer ever. I look forward to its release every year. A little limited in the Philly market if you want a whole case. Shangy's in Emaus always gets it, but it's first come first serve and sells out in one day. How long do these comments need to be?"
""

"Definitely one of the best Double IPA around, not overly sweet, bold but balanced, tasty, original and hoppy."
""
""
""
"This beer is amazing in appearance, smell and mouthfeel. Unfortunately, the booze and overall bitter tartness were a detractor for me."
""
""
""
"Picked this up the other day while looking for a different beer. Saw the $18.99 price tag and figured it had to be good. It was. the touch of honey is just great, such a nice beer. Very smooth and not overly hoppy. very satisfied. I think its only a spring beer so better get it when you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Milky golden visual with strong effervescent bubbles releasing honey first aromas, with citrus undertones and the promise of a hyper hoppy IPA.  This is a top notch IPA but the level of hops does not meet expectation the hoppy notes are mitigated by the sweetness of the honey.  Smooth mouthfeel from start to finish, would highly recommend but for the hop head you may have happier options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is phenomenal. Definitely worthy of the hype, a world-class unique double IPA like no other I have had yet. It really stands out from the pack."

"This beer definetly lives up to the hype. Probably one of the most refined DIPA i have ever had. From start to finish this beer has a mouthfeel like no other. i do believe the alcohol is a little overwhelming but im attributing this to being a few weeks old and lossing a bit of its hop character. All and all i enjoyed this very much and found it to be a very refined DIPA but probably could of been slightly more balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - pretty good beer but not worth the price or hype."
"I was lucky enough to taste a couple IPA's before having this Hopslam and I could see why it was so coveted and pricy. This beer is a very refined IPA, with a beautiful yellow color, a nice smooth taste, not overly bitter and psychotic like some of the more hoppy IPAs, but still hoppy enough to have a distinctive fragrance. The nose was not overpowering, it was very delicate, and the keg had been tapped 12 hours before. The mouth feel was really good, it is a beer that feels uniform. It is overall a great Imperial IPA, definitively one of the better IPA around East."
"Overall- This one's a sipper! I'm not saying this because it's overwhelmingly bitter or anything; I'm saying it because: 1) it's 10%!! And 2) The flavors really came out as this beer warmed up a little. At first I thought, man this beer just isn't as good as last years version, but then I gave it a chance to warm up and man I was on board! It really is a very unique beer. Definitely a must try"
""
"O: it's impossible not to give this beer a great rating it's got all the great characteristics of an IPA and then some; it's balanced from the first sniff to the last sip, it has such a friendly flavor profile, even if you're not into IPA's you're bound to enjoy this one!, I don't see it being a hop bomb, but in my case that's good because i enjoy drinking different beers one after the other and this won't ruin my palate. It's a definite must try if you can get your hands on one and even better if it's fresh!"
"Overall, despite popular opinion of Hopslam seeming to have lowered over the last couple releases, this is still an excellent beer, especially for hop lovers. And for a prestigious beer, the price isn't bad, either. Recommend."
""
""
""
""
"After trying this beer and having other beers of the same style I have to say this beer is mediocre and really a victim of its hype."
"O- Not as extreme as some (Palate Wrecker, Enjoy By IPA, Hoptimum), this is one of the most (dare I say) well balanced Double IPA's offered. It is amazingly flavorful, full-bodied and is it worth the hype?...Yes. (4.75)"
""
""
""
"O: I guess that I can see why so many people love this DIPA. It is a balanced DIPA, that is surprisingly not that bitter comparably. I guess I just don't know where to put it among the rest of the other great DIPAs. It is great, but its limited availability really hurts it a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost clear, burnt orange color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smells of resinous hops, citrus fruits, and a touch of honey. The combination of all the flavors from the nose blend so well together on the taste. All the flavors shine across the tongue and leave a nice aftertaste. Medium body, smooth through with little carbonation. A nice balance of bitterness and stickiness lingers on the tongue and lips. Deliciousness all the way!!"

"Thnx Kev!! Saw the bottle leftover in my fridge and had to make sure it was left behind on purpose. In my opinion, a bit overhyped. Doesn't take away from the fact that it's still a solid dbl. just took my last sip and that 10% just became ever so evident. Worth the try if you can find. Cheers!"

""
"Overall this was a very good beer, and it almost lived up to the hype; if not the best looking beer I’ve ever seen it’s at least in the top 3, and the drinkability for a 10% ABV beer was ridiculously smooth. I wish there was some more hop dominance in the aroma and flavor, but this was a damn good beer – pound for pound I think Two Hearted is better, but this is a fine DIPA."
"Overall (4.5): It actually is that good. It’s not on the level of Heady, in my opinion, or even a couple of others I’ve had that don’t get quite so much hype (looking at you, Double Dose), but man oh man is this beer well done. One of the things I look out for in these big DIPAs is whether or not the line between booze and hops is blurred—the good ones make it hard to tell where one ends and the other begins, and this is one of them. Big, yes. Boozy, yes. Hoppy as hell and executed cleanly, absolutely yes. This is a great beer."
""
"Over all, good beer, i don't think its amazing as a DIPA. The honey sweetness kind of knocked down the hops, i certainly would not call this a hop bomb."

"There was enough alcohol here but it really couldn't be detected and it wasn't until I downed this that I could feel the buzz. I think I've had too many other examples of this style to fully appreciate all this had to offer, but this did go down very smoothly and wasn't like anything I had before. The hype is justified if you're a hophead and want something different from the other popular examples out there. Otherwise, this would be a go if you don't mind shelling out the extra cash for something subtly enjoyable while deviating from the norm just a bit."

"A very good Imperial IPA that is incredibly hoppy, yet nicely balanced. Worthy of the reputation it has earned."
"Mouthfeel is thick, rich, chewy, a little sticky. Works nicely with the rest of the beer. Overall, this is a very good beer, but not mind blowing. I like it. But ignoring availability, I'd take Sucks or Double Jack over this. But I'd be very interested in a blind tasting to see how I feel without the influence of labels."

"On draft. Smells great, with lots of citrus, grapefruit and stone fruit. Lots of hops with generous bready malts, great balance, a highly drinkable and refreshing DIPA that packs a nice hoppy profile with a bit of a caramel malt touch in there. Great stuff."
"O: I look forward to Hopslam each year, but I'm not sad when it's dried up. This is a very unique and delicious offering from Bells. In my mind, I hype it up because it is one of the callings of the end of winter. It's a delicious 10% DIPA released when we're still enjoying Stouts and Porters at the tail end of winter. By the time it's gone, I'm grilling out and playing corn hole."

"Hands down my personal favorite. Picked up a case as soon as it came out for the season. Pricy but worth it. Pungent citrus, pine notes. Nice citrusy aroma (somewhat diminished by the honey as mentioned in an earlier review, but it does not take away from the overall experience). The addition of honey and a good amount of malt really balances the flavor, making it a very drinkable DIPA. Trying to make the case last into summer but I'm not sure it will be possible. I just can't keep my hands off this one. If you can find it...buy it!"
"Pretty exceptional, up there with the best double IPAs I've had. Very enjoyable and hides its strength in the drinkability. Certainly worth seeking out."

"Honestly enjoyed this more on draft a week ago, but this is still a wonderful beer and I am so happy to have access to it finally!"

"Bottle dated 1/21/2014. Picked up a couple of six packs as it came off the truck this morning, promptly put it in the fridge when I got home knowing I would be unable to let it sit. Tried it for the first time last year, and was blown away by it to the point that I was able to acquire 1 1/2 total cases from my local store, which proceeded to disappear over the following 5 or 6 weeks. THis year it had a reputation to live up to. Poured it into a Piraat glass immediately after retrieving it from the fridge, which in hind sight was a mistake. This needs to sit some and warm slightly prior to drinking, initially it was lacking in smell and taste, however it became clearly evident over the course of the first bottle that a slight warming does wonders in both areas. Poured a solid two fingers that quickly disappeared leaving a slight lacing on the sides of the glass which continued as the level was drained away. Again, very little was noticed in smell until it warmed slightly. One thing immediately noticeable was an acidic taste on the back sides of the tongue. This was rapidly followed as the beer warmed with the smell of grapefruit and pine tempered apparently by the honey, so it never developed the strong tastes typically associated with the type. Alcohol was never apparent in the quantity indicated, so as I remember from the previous year, it snuck up rather rapidly by the end of the first beer. Color was a nice golden orange, somewhat on the thin side versus heavy you would expect from a high ABV beer. I do think the 2013 version was slightly better, however that should be considered from the perspective the 2013 was a first time tasting, and therefore quite a high pedestal, and I have noticed a similar trend with other releases I have tasted. All in all, this is still one of my favorites. I am definitely looking forward to my other case I should have in another week or so."

"In the end, aroma is extremely blunted. Not as hop forward on the flavor as I would imagine. Quite hyped, but well crafted and one of the better double digit ABV hoppy beers. I did blind taste it with Sixpoint Hi-Res though and that beer won over this."
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured copper orange with a light white froth head. The smell is a balance of sweet malt and a balanced hop. The aroma was good but it lacked that pungent citrus and pine that others have. Taste was good with sweet malt grain and hop bitterness. The booze showed thru a little much for my taste and I didn't get any citrus from the hop but more bitter resin. The bitter lingers a little long and over powers a bit. It just didn't have the body and was almost astringent. If you love a bitter leaning IPA it's your beer for sure and overall a top 10 IPA for me just not my favorite."

"12 oz bottle, dated 12/27/2013. Pours a beautiful opaque orange with a good head and moderate lacing. The smell is sweet with honey and there is some moderate citrus notes. The taste is sweet up front but really balances out with the hop bitterness. I get a good amount of the honey and then juicy grapefruit. The feel is smooth and there is minimal lingering bitterness for me. I also don't really notice any alcohol despite the ABV. Overall this is an excellent beer that does a great job balancing the hops and sweetness. I wish I had it on-tap or at least a fresher bottle, but this beer still does not disappoint."
"Poured a beautiful rich copper tone. Not much head but I do like me beer very cold. Little carbonation. Hoppy blast on the nose along with citrusy tones. Similar for the taste. Your usual DIPA culprits. The thing that makes this beer stand out it that it's very well smooth and balanced. I would have never pegged it for 10%. It's also not too bitter which I like. You get a nice blast of hops and a full mouthfeel. Very good beer. I guess with all the hype I was just hoping to get """Hopslammed""" off my feet, but I came pretty close."

"Picked up a 6 pack from my local ABC liquor for 17.99$. Total wine wanted 21.00$ (highway robbery). I must say I felt stupid for paying so much for this beer but had to try due to the hype. Man am I glad I took the leap. This beer is quite possibly the most complete and tasty IPA I have ever had. Smell is floral with hints of the honey it's brewed with. Taste is complex with the usual mango and grapefruit hop flavor. Mouthfeel is great. Slight bitterness which I like but fades quickly leaving a great aftertaste that leaves the palate wanting more. I feel guilty drinking this beer as I feel like it is liquid gold. So glad this lived up the the hype and feel like I want to spend my life savings on more (kidding of course). Currently drinking and if this isn't heaven idk what is. Damn good brew!!!"

"O - its been a while since I held a hopslam in my hands, but goodness is it not an absolute dandy. Big and flavorful while pushing across flavors you just don't get from other ipa's of this size. This is one of the best ales of any kind you'll ever come across and clearly after experiencing hopslam you will understand the hype it does bring about. Just a truly GREAT brew"

"Overall, I'm thrilled to have tasted this beer on tap after its fresh seasonal release. It has a lot of heft and hop strength, and I really enjoy the nose with its sunny fruits that complement the color. If I'm honest, though, in some ways I think Bell doesn't do this amped up double quite as well as they craft the more accessible and compelling Two Hearts. And, I had a repeat performance with a beer born 1/21/14 three weeks afterwards--its color was already less orange, and both nose and palate had turned funky with no elemental improvements in exchange. It seems fragile to me. But I still want more...!"

"Overall, I just love this beer. The only knock for me is the price limits me to only a couple six packs a year. But on the other hand it is a treat to have and maybe I enjoy each one that much more, because I'm not buying a case. This is a beer I don't save, the fresher the better."
"O- I'm a bjg fan of bells and I've heard all the hype about thjs beer. was reluctant to buy jt because of price and finally splurged on a six pack and it was worth every penny. Mark your calendars because this is a must have when it js a release. Please bells do not make hopslam a year round selection"
"-I really liked this beer. The honey was an interesting touch that helped make it not just another hop bomb. Unfortunately, for the price of this beer,($20 for a 6-pack) there are other good options out there to choose from. I have bought 2 six packs so far and I find it safe to say that is all I need for a while."

"MF – Good carbonation which gives the beer a fizzy/sharp start (of course accentuated by the hoppiness), medium-bodied, dry finish, no real lasting bitterness for such a highly hopped DIPA. 4.75"

"O - Very good beer. Is it the best DIPA in the world? No it is not. But it absolutely is world class, and somewhat unique. I will drink this whenever I have the chance."
""
""
"O: I must conclude that this beer is hugely overrated. Every aspect of it reminds me of Enjoy By, except it's not done as well. It is by no means a bad beer, and I am of the opinion that nothing can live up to the amount of buzz behind a beer like this - I quickly learned this lesson with Pliny. I would not drive 35 minutes away on my hour-long lunch break to pay $22 for a six-pack of this again, but I would definitely buy it again if I stumbled upon it at my local store - not that that will ever happen."

"Pours a hazy amber with a thin, white head. Little lacing. Lots of hop resin, tropical fruit and biscuit aromas on the nose. Honey notes on the palate with nice hop bitterness. Very dry. Some heat from the 10% ABV. Super smooth with a medium body. Nice level of carbonation. Overall, Bell's Hopslam is unlike any other DIPA out there, well crafted and balanced, it's definitely worth seeking out!"

"Overall I thought my bottle was forward with the alcohol in the nose and in the taste. Once getting past that the beer is very tasty with orange and some more tropical citrus on the nose and in the taste. The honey gives the mouth feel a little bit of a thickness but is overall pleasant.  On an overall basis I want to try this beer on tap to see if the alcohol forward ness is limited to this batch. Very good beer."
"O: A truly unique DIPA taste experience. The hop forwardness is juxtaposed with a sweetish finish, followed by some hoppy reemergence. The transitions are remarkable. Meanwhile, the 10% ABV remains mostly hidden. An incredible DIPA that lives up to the hype."

"There is one of the best beers in the world today. Unbelievable aroma. Citrus, pines and a touch of honey really have your palate craving it. For the amount of different hops it is made with, it is pretty unbelievable how smooth of a beer it is. Bell's Hopslam is simply one of the best beers in the world."
"O - I'm glad I have more, don't get me wrong, but this beer did not live up to the hype in the way that other beers have. I'll hold off final judgment until I can try it fresh at the brewery, but, until then, I gotta say that I'll stick with my local beers that nobody seems to give a shit about (I'm looking at you, Swami's!)"
""
""
""
"While this is an excellent tasting beer from the bottle, it is enhanced by drinking it from the glass to capture the aromas. The scent and smell of this beer coupled with it's hoppy yet smooth taste, makes this beer both delicious and enjoyable. Highly recommend!"
""
"Relative to what I remember and wrote last year, the hop flavor takes a back stage to the big honey sweetness. The floral and citrus flavors are overpowered by the sweet honey. It's still tasty but I liked when the big sweetness was balanced by the big hop flavors. There is an astringent aftertaste in the boozy finish. Downgrading my rating."

"O: I just love highly hopped brews that don't smack you with harsh bitterness but truly highlight and display the lush flavor of the hops. This is a masterpiece of complexity and harmony. This beer mimics me of a tropical fruit Naked juice but with alcohol. Only down side is availability and the price."

"Pours a beautiful hazed orange amber with a creamy head of off white foam that lasts and leaves rings of lace. Nose is resonant with hops sweetness. At first it's tangerine, then a bit of grapefruit, some pine. but then the floral overcomes anything you can name and these hops become pure perfumed lightness. The malt is a breaddy scent with a bit of earthy honey. Orange blossoms. No alcohol on the nose. Taste is very sweet. The honey is thick or so it seems and the malt is rich. It has a fruitiness form the tangerine and grapefruit but it's very dry and so it's earthier rather than juicier. The malt becomes like a soft sugar cookie on the nose and on the palate. It's almost chewy. There is a faint herbal that becomes stronger as you drink. I was waiting for a biting, bitter, tongue bruising like the label said but I found the bitter to be a bit more than moderate. As I am finishing the glass the juiciness is coming forward more and the scent is becoming a bit more tropical. The alcohol is only a hint on the very back end of the swallow and in the warmth as it finishes. Mouthfeel is creamy, sticky and full-ish. The aftertaste fades and all that remains is the bitter, the pine and the hop floral sweetness."
""
""
""
"A little sticky/sweeter than I like for my IPAs, but great beer anyway and glad I tried."
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, copper-gold coloring with a slow flow of carbonation and a frothy, low profile, bright white head that clings all over the glass, and slowly settles into a filmy surface coating as you drink. Aromas of deep, rich, bitter, resinous hops all over the nose, with a subtle sweet caramel backbone, and a blend of tropical fruits that include pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. Very balanced and very rich nose. Flavors are tropical fruit forward, rich and sweet, with a blast of citrus tart and bitter to follow. That's a lot of fruit on the palate all at once, but it is perfectly balanced by the pungent, dank, piney and grassy backbone, rich in resinous characteristics. This goes from fruity to forest green in a flash. Wow. All through this, there is a subtle sweetness of caramel darting in and out. Great tasting brew. The aftertaste has some pepper spicing and stronger floral notes, but it's still all hops. Smooth and robust in mouth, leading to a smooth, clean, slightly drying finish. This is amazing."
"I love you Bell's but the DIPA category has caught up with you. In 2007, I had my first taste of Hopslam and it was a religious experience. But seven years have passed and while Hopslam is still a standard bearer for the category many have joined the ranks. It's a great DIPA but in my opinion no longer the Holy Grail and just last week I paid $22.00 for a six pack which I suppose isn't crazy given the going rate of so many over-priced bombers? Again, still very, very good but no longer """I'll search for it for weeks.""" I'm in the Chicagoland area and for me, that DIPA is now Three Floyd's Permanent Funeral!!! And for Bell's, think Oracle DIPA (only available in MI) but really, really worth the drive but call first....summer release."

"Poured from bottle into chilled DFH pint glass. Beautiful amber/orange color. Short but fluffy white head, which quickly dissipates to this white collar. Lots of minuscule bubbles and excellent sticky lacing throughout the experience. On the nose, the initial scent is a lovely pink grapefruit with floral hints, followed by sweet papaya (must be the honey). On the palate, the flavor profile replicates yet intensifies the olfactory sensations. Nice full mouthfeel -- not chewy per se, but ample and all-encompassing. Virtually no alcohol burn. The finish is long and sweet, yet balanced -- meaning that there is enough malt and alcohol present to extend the finish, without any of the elements (the sweetness from the honey, the pine from the hops, the malt, or the burn of alcohol) overpowering or dominating the experience. Just a long, steady, well integrated finish all the way through. Hard to believe that anyone could actually plan for this to happen -- seems more like a coincidental miracle of divine artwork than anything designed by human hands. All in all, a tremendous experience. This beer is truly unique. I've certainly never had anything else quite like it."

"Served in a Sam Adams special pint glass. The aroma on this is wonderful with a bright mandarin orange, sweetness and orange blossom honey. Deep gold color with large white persistent head. Flavor is slightly sweet up front that fades to a bitter hop-flavored middle and off-dry finish that borders of astringent. Some orange sweetness and hint of honey with a light grainy character as well. Some alcohol warming. Overall this year's is very well balanced and easy to drink, way better than I remember it. Not just the hype apparently!"

""
""
"Also, I refused to review this beer last year because of how awful the 13 batch was. It was overly bitter and abrasive, tons of alcohol power and no honey. I'm glad 14 is a return to form, but the 2012 batch will remain my favorite of all time."
""
""
""

"Do I like Abrasive more than Hopslam? Probably - but I can really only do one Abrasive at a time before it just gets to be too much for me... Hopslam is dangerously smooth - I could drink a lot of these."

"I don't get it.  Bitter with a cardboard like after taste."
""
""
""
"O: this is really one of my favorite beers. Admittedly, I've not had either of the Pliney's or heady topper, but comparing to other DIPAs it's amazing! I would prefer a little more grapefruit hoppiness ala sculpin, but really love the minimal maltiness that I don't really like in beers like DFH 90 minute."

"O - a classic. easily worth the price."
""
"Overall, I think this isn't just my cup of tea for an IPA. I think I'm just more into the """newer hop""" IPAs that give more hop flavor without so much bitterness. I also do tend to steer clear of most beers marked DIPA to avoid that slick caramelly flavor that I don't really like. Still, this is a style with some pretty stiff competition, and there are many year-round IPAs that I would choose any day over this one. It's definitely really solid, but I have to say I'm a little disappointed."
""
"Overall: It's a good IIPA but I feel that the unmasked high abv takes away from the overall appeal of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Man, this is a real treat to drink. Doesn't quite touch the same enjoyable or drinkable standard set with Two Hearted, but it's a monster of a DIPA without being too overwhelming or overblown. Lots of amazing flavor profiles make this up - any fan of these beers must seek this out at least once. I probably won't immediately get another 6-pack any time soon, but I'll welcome having some of this any time that it's offered to me."

"Overall: My first taste was a little overwhelming, but once my palate adjusted ie “hop slammed” this was an immensely enjoyable DIPA. A great looking body with excellent hop complexity and a nice, sweet (but not too sweet) malty build. Puts to shame all the other boozy, cloying, bitter DIPAs out there. If only this was a regular around these parts…"

"I look forward to it every year it's on of the best double ipa's out. I wish I could get it all year long.It's just awesome from the smell to its taste.

""

"Overall- Is similar to many other IPA's the two defining characteristics seem to be the very forward honey on the noes, and the unpleasant filminess. With a very middle of the road taste and the lack of followthrough on the honey I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again, but not bad by any means."

"O: A relatively high quality beer. For all the hype, and a $17 price tag for 6, I was extremely disappointed. As my first review, also a little disappointed to have to disagree so drastically with a community that has led me to some outstanding beers I never would have tried otherwise. Bell's Brewery really just hasn't been in my wheelhouse. As referenced above, I always get either some off-flavors or smells with each of the 5-6 beers I've tried."
""
""

"And just for the record, the bottle I just drank was packaged 1/16/14 -- or less than two weeks ago. So, it's not like there was any drop off -- or if there was in that short a time, shame on Bell's."

"Spent most of the weekend trying to secure a few six packs of this year's release of Hopslam. I let it sit in the fridge a few days before giving it a whirl. Poured a hazy golden color typical of American IPAs. Smell was terrific with the hops overtaking everything else which is expected. Front end was fantastic with the abundance of hops and bitterness. Thought the back end was a little too sweet for me but guess that is where the honey comes in. It was great to finally try this beer since I have heard about it for quite some time. I expected a lot more from this beer and that was probably due to the hassle getting ahold of it and the hype surrounding Hopslam. Overall it was a great IPA, one that I could drink regularly. It wasn't the best IPA I have tried but it was certainly one that I would order. Not sure if the $18.99 per six pack and the hassle acquiring the beer were worth it in the end."
""
"The amount of trouble and dollars i went through to get a six pack of this particular nectar generated high expectations. Hopslam is good but not great. In my experience, the honey impartment blurred the hop intensity. Mouthfeel is spot on and the 10% is hardly noticeable. Kudos for this. That a brewer can generate this type of excitement: double kudos. For me the beer not only doesnt live up to the hype, i can probaly find two or three readily available brews at a more approachable price that deliver more. But i can also see how this appeals to many afficianados due to its subtleties and present hoppiness. Could probably be a great introductory example for those who want a big sweetish Iipa on occasion. Maybe i am just cranky that i had to monitor a beer store's twitter feed to score some of this ..."
""
""
""
"Drinkabilty - At 10% the beer is so smooth and easy to enjoy. The hops are very diverse and are both sweet and bitter strong. Every year I have this beer I like it more and more. Only knock is the price. World class, a must try!"
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer, but I want to like it more. I'm not crazy about it. There are many other IPAs I would rather drink. That being said, it is good. Just didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe it was this year's batch? Not sure... Will gladly finish of this six-pack, but won't go out of my way to get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really wonderful take on the style that makes it quite clear why this is such a popular beer. One of the more balanced DIPAs I've had and the use of honey makes for a uniqueness that you don't get in other beers of the same style. I'll certainly make a point to see this out on a yearly basis, and I might sit on one bottle just out of curiosity to how well it holds up over time. I think it may have jumped to the front of the line for me in terms of offerings from Bell's. Just an outstanding DIPA from the Midwest that certainly represents itself well compared to the heavy-hitters from the Northeast and Southwest."

"Can't really see the color too well through the brown bottle but it looks clear and golden. Smells like pine and citrus but quite sweet. First impression taste-wise is an abundance of resinous hops, but it quickly becomes sweet (not overly so) as the honey flavors emerge in the backend. It's a flavor combination that works really well, but six-packs are pretty pricey and hard to find from what I understand so I don't think I'll be enjoying this one as much as I'd like to."

"Man, when this stuff hit Ohio this month, it sold out within 6 hours at many locations. During my hunt it was the same story - """We put out 80 cases at noon and it was gone by 530""". I finally found it at Jungle Jim's. What a great beer. The 10% abv is well hidden behind the taste."

"Overall, an incredible DIPA, but I think the honey aspect could have been more well thought out."

"Great beer. Best after or during a good meal, at 10% take your time and you will get a warm relaxing buzz. I'm not a beer expert by any means, so excuse any misuse of jargon, but it seems like the honey balances out the bitter hop flavor. Properly poured it will have a good head so when you take your first drink make sure to get some on your upper lip, especially if you have a mustache; you will get to taste this amazing nectar all night long."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy copper/gold color with about a finger’s breadth of pure white, bubbly head. The bubbles linger for a few minutes before settling to confluent patches of large bubbles around the surface of the liquid. Scattered strands of lacing decorate the glass. The aroma is of grapefruit/orange citrus, honey, cane sugar, wet earth, a bit of lemongrass, and subtle white pepper. It tastes of various citruses - primarily grapefruit and lemon rind - alongside a predominant honey flavor. Cane sugar, grass, and some earthen/peppery hops round it out. Mouthfeel is lively, but slightly more viscous than many other DIPAs, perhaps due to the honey. It has a wet, resinous finish as the bitter hops linger; a bit of warming alcohol is noticeable right on the end.. Overall, the honey adds a unique dimension to this big beer that hides its alcohol very well. The honey isn't entirely to my liking, but it is a very well executed beer none-the-less."

"Pours out a dark amber with a one finger white head with great retention and nice lacing. Smell is pretty fruity for what I expected. Some really nice guava, grapefruit, a tiny bit of pine and maybe a little sweetness from some malt. Taste is fairly fruity with basically what is in the nose except more nice and fruity. Mouthfell is thick for the style. Really a nice beer. Been a while since I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"This is a winner worth it's steep price tag. I love having a different type DIPA option."
""
""

"Overall: This isn't an abrasive, blow your face off DIPA. I had this one at a Bell's event at a bar in town and the representative made sure to emphasize that this isn't a West Coast style IPA. It's a lot like Two Hearted- an incredible, unique IPA that has different characteristics than their west coast cousins. This one is sweeter and thicker than West Coast DIPAs, which really tones down the hoppiness and makes it compliment the beer more than give it a shocking, abrasive edge. Expect something slightly different than you expect when you see DIPA and you'll be pleased with this brew. Expect something like Stone Enjoy By, and you're going to be disappointed when you aren't burping up hops every half hour for the next 3 hours. An incredible beer, and a must try for any craft beer aficionado."

"Not as bitter as I thought it would be, probably due to the Honey. Bottle poured into a snifter glass. Bottled 10 day ago (1/11/14). Great fruity smell, very smooth. Almost a little too malty for me, but not really. Hopslam met all my expectations and then some. CHEERS!!"

"I dig! Not your average double IPA. This steers clear of the citrus bombs that reign supreme in the Double IPA world and delivers an earthy, sweet, bitter IPA that will rock your socks off.

""

"Pours a beautiful copper amber with a generous head that quickly dissipates to a lasting tan lacing. The aroma on the ale is pure hops. Tons of citrus, grapefruit, lots of pine and dare I say a hint of coriander. It sips medium bodied and coats the palate in a very pleasant way. The flavor is all hops (as expected and anticipated). An ample amount of pine and grapefruit. Super bitter and dry with little to no balance. But this is the intention of the ale. Balance is not a need, necessity, or a want from an ale like this. It is all about the hops and this one delivers. Super bitter, but fresh and florally. Not a hint of the high abv. It's not a balanced ipa but it is Every thing it is meant to be. Not an ale I'd want to down daily but most certainly one that I'll look forward to enter every year."

"Picked up a fresh six pack from my bottle store today. Poured from a bottle into my Founders (I know, I know...) tulip glass. Aggressive pour yields a solid 1 inch head that lingers, and lingers... Slowly dissipates leaving excellent lacing sticky to the glass. The color? This is what this style should be, a hazy orange gold tint. Big up front hop kick in the nose with solid boozy smell behind. Exactly what I wanted. Taste? I can only imagine what this is like on tap if it's this delicious out of the bottle!! Very similar to Doom, without Doom's overpowering alcohol kick. Loads of piney bitter hops, held in check by the honey to balance them out. For a ten percenter, this is a very drinkable beer! The sweetness of the honey is the perfect balance to the hops. This beer takes the sting out of a cold bitter Michigan winter night. Damn good beer!"

"Overall, the best thing about this beer was its aroma. From the moment you crack that top, the stickiest, sweetest, fruitiest, most tropicaliest hops bombard your senses. Here the hops truly overpower the grain, allowing it to fade into the back and form a true base. Although this isn’t barrel aged, we felt that there was significant inclusion of vanilla bean extract, much in the same sense that Founders’ Doom presented with. It adds a certain softness to the inherent bitter flavors held within. Speaking of bitters, which is a huge advertising point of this beer, we felt that that aspect of it was rather dimmed following our expectations. The hops were gloriously present and diverse, but just weren’t to that palate crinkling extreme that many DIPAs search for. This restraint went appreciated, and ultimately lent towards the final balance. This is a fantastic beer, and although we wouldn’t tag it in the same individualized company as Heady and the Hill Farmstead one-offs, it takes a high rank in the order of the regular fridge sippers."

"Everything about this beer is an IPA lovers dream. Alcohol taste a bit over the top. Looks beautiful and feels good rolling over the palate and down the gullet. A perfect balance between aroma and taste, which is much more than I can say about most others. Not too syrupy, not too """vacant"""."

"The original and still the best hoppy beer available. A beautiful orange-golden appearance with hops, citrus, honey, and pine on the nose. Taste is pine and grapefruit with honey and sweet malt to balance out the bitterness. Booze barely makes its presence known. 2014 is a great batch!"

"In total though, this beer has kind of become muddled in its place since I initally had it over 4 years ago. It's a good DIPA for sure, and at least somewhat distinct, but the pure volume of great (and much easier to get) IPA's currently in the marketplace make its place in the upper echelon of the style somewhat tenuous. To be fair though, if you come across it, give it a shot. I just wouldn't go truck chasing for it."

"Overall: My favorite beer of all time, narrowly edging Bells other staple, Two-Hearted. God damn, theres something about this beer that no other DIPA can touch. I think what sets it apart is the addition of honey, which creates a smoothness that rounds out the bitterness to a point where words cant describe how amazing this beer is. Good luck finding it, this sells fast everywhere, and its obvious why. The best DIPA i've ever had, no contest."

"Top 3 IPA's I ever had. So full of flavor, yet very drinkable. I love to taste the hops but not be overwhelmed and this seems like the perfect combination of hops. It does not taste like there is 10% alcohol in this beer. The flavor is addictive and makes me want to keep sipping."

"D - This is a benchmark for the style of the 'double' IPA. Most in the style are merely IBU bombs, with an obnoxious palate wrecking bitterness and lack of any real flavor. This isn't. Reminds me of a domestic favorite of mine, Red Racer IPA, in that it has tons and tons of flavor but is still immensely drinkable. Absolutely delicious DIPA, and that's coming from a guy who doesn't really care for the style."
""

"Definitely accomplishes what it sets out to do - pound your palate with hops, and hop essence. It's not as refreshing as its West Coast brethren but I like the unique take on the style."
""

"O: If I were a hophead, I would buy this by the case. An outstanding representation of an Imperial IPA. The honey really smooths the bitterness out. You got hop-slammed, sucka!"
"Another great brew from Bells. Poured into a pint glass. Golden to dark golden color. The aroma of hops filled my nostrils. The toaste of hops and fruit filled my mouth with great delight. The taste and aftertaste were completely smooth to me. Another great brew with great fan fare. Worth trying. This beer is so popular that we have customers ask for it by the case"

My tap review came from a shit hole that still had hopslam on tap 3 weeks after it hit the market in Minnesota (Casper's in Eagan, MN) gottah love it. It comes across as a little too syrupy from the bottle and lingers too long which can be good or bad. All in all a great ale but Surly Abrasive wins. Cheers."

"Very strong beer and not one that you can drink every day (if you want to be productive). It has a nice look to it in a pilsner and the aroma is rather fruity to me.

"After looking for a while, I finally found a liquor store with a few bottles of this beer left in stock, so I bought one. This bottle is nearly three months old, I'm sure the hoppy flavor and aroma I was looking for was much more prominent two months ago. There's always next year."

"Overall - This is without a doubt the best DIPA or IPA I have ever had. Even better than Pliny and Double Jack. It may not have the hop bill of Pliny or the intricacies of Double Jack, but the overall balance and experience makes it superior to them both and the use of honey in this beer is simply masterful. I could drink this beer every day and still not have enough. I don't know exactly what was in the Ambrosia that the Greek Gods were drinking, but I imagine it was something like this. Nectar of the Gods, indeed I have been Hopslammed"

"O: excellent DIPA, one of the most complex hop profiles i've ever come across. while the honey is present, the mouthfeel was a litle thin. not perfectly balanced. definitely drink this one for the hops, definitive of the style."
"with all the hype around this I wanted it to floor me just like heady did, and just like the younger did, but it didn't. I mean, its a great beer don't get me wrong, but it didn't stand out to me as something worthy of the absurd praise its received. the pour is a nice hazy honey color with a creamy white head with fine retention, beautiful. the nose is oily hops, high alpha semisweet fruity hops, with some pollen character from the honey and a subtle but complimentary yeast strain. the flavor is boldly hoppy, both bitter as hell and oily sticky danky. its a beer with plenty of motion, moving from a fruity sort of vibe to a really gnarly bitter bomb. the sweetness of the honey is hard to pick out, and the alcohol is shockingly well hidden. you would never know this was 10% abv until you drank 3 or 4 of them and it walloped you! great mouthfeel with groovy carbonation and a fuller medium body. there is a great resinous feel left after the swallow. overall an outstanding imperial ipa, one of the better ones ive had honestly, but it just didn't blow my mind the way it has for others."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is rather easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. There's enough bitterness to prevent this from becoming sweet, especially since it has honey in it."
""
"O: Perfect. Having this on the same night as Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock. The the oldest bock style reputed by Luther as the best in the world, and one of the the newest styles, amongst the best in the modern world. Leaving NA soon for China, so glad to have found two such great beers."
""
""
""
""
"Hopslam lives up to the hype. i have had the last three years and they are always good. One thing I noticed this year compared to others however is the fact that it is 10 times better on tap. You pull a lot of the honey on tap, but hardly get any of the honey out of the bottle. I have also tried old Hopslam and this is not a good beer after age. Best when fresh"

"Pours a nice orange/straw color, with pretty small head. Smells like mild citrusy hops, with a certain tang to it. Smell is not as strong as I would have expected, but good. The taste is much like the smell, but less delicious hops and more booze and bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfectly good, but overall, I was surprised by this beer. I'm surprised it's got the high rating that it does, as while it's good, I'd put it below almost every other DIPA on the list. I'll have to try again in case I got a bad/old bottle."

"Live life drink beer!!!:-)"
"O - if you like dipa's, I would put this on your list of """must try""" beers."
"O: My favorite description of this beer was """like your cat ate your bag of weed and then pissed on your christmas tree.""" That pretty much sums it up. This doesn't have the tropical fruit qualities of Pliny or Heady; it is a direct jack hammer assault on your taste buds. That being said, it is absolutely excellent. Thanks Jeff for hooking this one up!"
""
"O: If I had to sum this up I would say it is like the younger sibling to Heady. Perhaps people don't like comparisons, but, I would say their hop profiles are similar, with Hopslam being perhaps a bit more tropical and sweet, with slightly less hop feel at the end. Both are extremely balanced and smooth which to me is what really separates these top notch DIPA's. That being said, Hopslam is a very good beer, though not the Hopslam I was expecting. i really like the floral/sweet honey undertones to compliment the hops, a nice touch, otherwise what you get is probably one of the more easy drinking DIPA's out there. Not sure it is worth the hype as it wouldn't be at the top of my Hop list, but it certainly is worth trying and one day it'd be nice to try a more fresh batch."
""
"Thick rolling body, smooth mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Bright tropical fruit hop flavor on the tip of the tongue followed by resinous bitterness. Sweet caramel and honey beneath it all. Faintly sour citric acid like taste on the back of the tongue. Sweetness balanced by bitterness very nicely. A little more detectable alcohol than expected but overall a very good beer. Honestly like cooked tropical fruits, and citric acid covered in a sweet glaze followed by bitter rind."

"O: An excellent beer. I'm not a hop-head by any means and I could drink this beer all night. I assumed the age contributed to the muted hop presence, but I prefered it's condition when I drank it."
""
"O: This is one of the best smelling DIPAs on the market and I really like the combination of hops that create the aromas/flavor profile. The 10% ABV is extremely well hidden and this beer is very easy to drink - I could easily have a couple of these in a session and be really happy about it."

"overall I really like this beer and would seek it out again. I recommend it fresh though!"

"One of my favorite beers. The thing that has always stood out to me about this beer is the hints of honey. It is such an easy drinking beer, but the taste and layers of flavor are so complex that by the time you start to put it together, you take another sip and realize that there are even more layers. One of my top beers!"

""
"It's Hopslam! Need I say more?"
""
""

"Pours a light brown to yellow with a thick head. Good lacing. Aroma is strong hops - mostly pine with some floral. Flavor is consistent with the nose - sweet up front and piney bitter on the back persists well. Maybe a hint of honey sweetness present on the back end. Great beer."
""
""
"I was blown away last year after trying this for the first time on tap upon it's release. This was almost as good but maybe because it was a bottle and not on tap. i am very glad my brother snagged a case for me. I will definitely seek this out next year. Bell's brewery rocks the hops."
""
""
""
""

"Loved it! Overall it is fantastic. Gives the sweetness of honey without any cloying or harshness. Lifts the flavour profile and in an incredibly drinkable way. One of the best hoppy beers i've come across."

"This was a very good beerb that started me into realy trying many kinds of beers for the first time and it is bad that you are unable to get it when you want it.

"Flavor is good. The hops are well-balanced by the sweetness of the honey. Almost a little too sweet, with a bitter finish as expected. Mouth feel is good for style and carbonation seems about right. I was hoping for a bit more in the flavor, but a good drinkable beer."

"The body is moderate. Would like a bit more depth here as well as a bit more astingency to balance out the hop notes. Carbonation is light and could use a touch to balance. Some heat and a minor oily note in the finish. Overall a nice west coast IPA but really would like a touch more balance."

"This ale provides a plethora of juicy fruit flavors with balance bitterness. Awesome mouthfeel and aroma as well. The sweetness is bright and blends seamlessly with the wide range of hop flavors."

""
"This has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Yes, I know it is a double IPA but I categorize all of them together. Had it as part of a sampler with several other beers and what I love most about this beer is that although you get a strong sense of hoppiness, the honey quickly dissipates any of the lingering bitterness that is usually left by such IPA's. A must have if you are ever at the brewery, try to save as much as possible. Currently aging an '11 and a '12 together. Looking forward to when I can try them next year!"

"Bottle to tulip. Golden orange, crystal clear, quarter inch of eggshell head that dissipates after a minute. Strong pine notes in this edition with some floral background, perhaps a tiny hint if citrus. Medium/heavy mouthfeel, syrupy pine hops hit the pallate hard upfront with a slight malt backbone. Bitterness comes in late and lingers a bit. Overall it lacks the citrus notes and balance of the 2012 vintage. Good, but in my opinion this year doesn't earn the high rating it has on the top 250."

"O: In my opinion this is the second best DIPA in the world only to Heady and im still not sure if its neck and neck, this beer has the greatest mouth feel i have ever experienced in a beer..Just a superb brew and i cannot get enough of it! This is a pricey brew at 16.99$ a 6 pack but its worth it! One of the most enjoyable beers i have ever had..period."

"What can be said? I'm an IPA guy, and this is my second favorite beer. Being seasonal, I'm shocked to find it, let alone a case of it. It drinks easy and hoppy at first, but finishes with a strong alcohol bite. Being a DIPA, I would expect nothing less. Took a vacation to Michigan just to hit the the triangle of breweries and Bell's was both my wife and my favorite. They do not disappoint."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Glad to try it. Certainly won't go out of my way to get it again!"
""
""
""
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."

"It pours a yellow/amber with medium retention. It smells amazingly hoppy and sweet. It has a big sweet taste upfront followed by a great hop finish. Medium body with god carbonation. This is a great IPA. I would highly recommend."
"Poured a nice amber into a tulip glass, bubbles can be seen rising and a very slight off white head formed. The scent is of floral grassy hops, pine and grapefruit, with slight hints of honey and cat urine. The cat urine scent became more pronounced as the beer warmed but was almost pleasant in an odd way. The taste was excellent. Bitter pine begins each sip, going into more bitter pine mixed with grapefruit and ending on notes of bitter grapefruit pith. There is also a nice presence of malt, though it is overwhelmed somewhat by the hop profile, as well as nice hints of honey that are present throughout each sip. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with a slight carbonation, but not enough to dull the tongue to the hops or make drinking the beer difficult. There is also a slight stickiness but not as much as in some examples of the style. The mouthfeel aids the flavor of the beer and does not detract. Overall this is an excellent DIPA, by far one of the best, with an excellent hop flavor profile, well worthy of the title hop bomb. Yet it also is well balanced and avoids the pitfalls of being too hoppy. A beer to try and to enjoy."

"I am a fan of IPA's. This one is a DIPA which I have had a few but this one is really good. But from the beers I have had from Bell's this one is no exception. I love the 2 hearted ale and this one builds upon a similar paradigm, its just a bit more adventurous. When I drink Bells it makes me think of Hemingway and this one is no exception it should be like For Whom the Bell Tolls really, when you open it it smells of a pine forest, much like the novel. But it goes into a tropical citrus character. I was getting pine, but also grapefruit and pineapple from the aroma. The color was a nice golden ale typical of the color scheme for this style. The taste was much like the smell a good bit floral from the hops, but not bitter really. I know the label says that it is strong, but I felt it was really well balanced considering the amount of hops and IBU's in a DIPA. This is a great cooler weather beer, perfect for spring or fall, although it will not last that long. It was pricey but was worth it and just be careful the 10% will get you. Enjoy this one if you can find it!"
""

""
""
"What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Everyone knows it is perfect, wish they made it more often. I paid $22 for a 6 pack but since it is 10% alcohol you can't really complain about the price. I am glad that we were able to find some in my small town. Has a great smell and a big taste, I can't really describe it other than hop heaven"

"O- What an incredible beer! Really good DIPA! The balance between malt and hops are so good!"

"o-Really great hoppy beer. I expected a stronger bitter taste from the name but I think the honey balances out the hops nicely. It also leaves a really nice aftertaste of the fresh clean hoppiness. From the hype, I expected better but I maybe biased from having Enjoy By IPA recently and growing up on Dreadnaught and Arctic Panzer Wolf."

"O-Really like this one. I'm more into the really grapefruit IPAs that just smack you in the face, but this is really nice. Well put together. Very balanced. Noticed my bottles from the case that I drank a week after I had it might have a slightly more hoppy profile. Still a very nice beer."
""

"Overall, this is a good beer. It is a beer for the hop lover. Quite frankly, I would choose Hoptimum over Hopslam. However, Hopslam is a great beer in its own right."

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"overall: very hoppy but not enough malt to balance out the bitterness. did not live up to its hype. there are much better offerings out there for beer of this style. would much rather have a GUBNA, Hoptimum or Hercules."
""
""
"No need for me to repeat everyone else's review in detail, just summarizing that yes, indeed, Hopslam is unbelievably good. Absolutely lives up to expectations in every aspect. Had to hold myself back not to drink all six at once, which would have been funny given its ABV (key takeaway is that you don't taste the alcohol)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just in general summed up this beer reminds me of Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty when he becomes god for 7 days. Bell's Hopslam is one of the most well rounded beers I have had in quite a while. Its very easy to sum up in word AMAZING!! for the everyday IPA drinker!"

"Still one of my all time favorites. I will buy it every year."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was a little skeptical of the hype surrounding this beer. But i have to admit, it lived up to, and possibly exceeded my expectations. I am reluctant to hand out big scores on the beers I rate or review, but this is certainly one of the best double IPAs I have ever had. A big thanks to my friend Rachel for sending a bottle my way to let me experience it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent double IPA. I have not encountered an ale with such a floral character. I do prefer pine notes but this is quite enjoyable still."
"O - you can definitely sense the quality that's put into this brew. Everything very obviously fits together well. Not my favorite IPA by any stretch, but really nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a hazy amber with an off white head with excellent retention. The lacing is splendid. It holds for a second or two and then falls uniformly back into the brew. Very nice to watch. The aroma is very much filled with citrus and resinous pine, along with a floral sweetness and a detectable malty backbone. The taste transfers from orange to bitter grapefruit, but then the bitterness just about disappears to reveal malt with a nectar like sweetness. The finish comes back with a bitterness stronger than the introduction. The mouthfeel is excellent. Thick and rich with a delicate kiss of carbonation."

"*Raul would like to revisit this one. He was just settling into the craft game, and although Raul does remember not enjoying this in the least, he'd like to try it again as his palate had no turned into platinum"
""
"This is overhyped for sure. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a great DIPA. There’s plenty of character to make it a good and tasty beer, but $20+ for a six-pack? Never again. I think I need to stop going on the forums before trying a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, I can honestly say this is the best double-IPA I have ever had (granted, I have never had the luxury of trying Pliny the Elder or Heady Topper <--- commonly implicated as Hopslam's only worthy competitors in the style. Though the price for a 6-pack is steep (I paid $15.99 for 6 and that was a sale-price), it is well worth it. Phenomenal brew and I wish I hadn't drank the 6-pack so fast; can't wait till next year!!"
""
"O: 3.0 - very disappointed for my first experience with Bell's Hopslam, which I have been hunting down in the greater Washington D.C. area for > 1 month and purchased for $21.99/six pack; obviously, I have read the reports of several others that this is a bad batch, which I'm certainly willing to entertain. I tasted it side-by-side with Lagunitas Sucks DIPA, which is clearly the superior beer in 2013. For the exorbitant price and hype, Hopslam will probably be my biggest disappointment in 2013. I won't be purchasing it again until encountering other reviews that attest to a world-class batch."

"I'm not usually a fan of IPAs but this was definitely an exception. I got this from peabody's fresh collection at only 5 days old!! The color was a nice clear golden/amber and the taste and smell were both very crisp. The extreme hops are refreshing and will """hopslam you right in the teeth"""."
"Good beer, but nothing to write home about. Had some nice citrus flavors up front but got killed by what seemed like an off-the-chart IBU. Just seemed off balance. Like it couldnt decide what to be; a fruity double or straight hop bomb. The middling knocked it from its perch"
""
""
""
"Overall... yeah this is worth the hype. The focus is ALL on the hop flavor and aroma, and the residual sweetness tames the bitterness to really let the bright flavors and aromas shine through. I definitely want more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - That has to be one of the better DIPAs I've had and just a winner all around. Whether it's $18-a-sixpack good is another question. I'm glad I tried it and like it a lot but think I'll stick to one sixpack per release. When you compare the per-bottle cost to what you'd pay in a bar, it's really not pricey at all. Just pricey for bottled. Thumbs up."
""

"O: I expected a lot considering the hype...this beer delivers!! Very tasty, smooth, and easy to drink. Well done Bell's!!"
""
""
""
"overall a great DIPA , though 2 hearted isn't much different, and is everywhere year round."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 4.75 The beer, if tasted blindly, begins like any other imperial IPA and has similar qualities. What sets this beer apart is the delicate interplay between flavors the expert blending of hops, malt, and honey for an experience unlike any other. I love the addition of adjunct sugars to produce a caramel sweetness that balances the big bitter of IPAs. This is a good way to allow huge bitter characteristics to shine, while keeping it in balance to produce a beer with surprising drinkability.(Considering the 10% abv and very full body)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good, not great. I have to say, I don't really get what all the fuss is about. Pretty easy drinking for 10% ABV, so it's got that going for it, which is nice."

""
""
""
""
"Had never heard of this beer until now. As I understand it is a limited brew, I will continue to order until it runs out. I have to be careful as the 10% ABV knocks me in the dirt pretty quick. With the aroma and taste, it goes down smooth with a pleasant linger on the pallate, which makes it very easy to have too many too quick. There is a nice hint of citrus. Just right."
""
""
"Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While it's not the 'be all and end all' of DIPAs as some folks hail it, it's definitely a winner for those hopheads among us! As mentioned above, there are better examples of the style out there (particularly Sierra Nevada's """Hoptimum"""), but on balance, this is a pretty incredible beer that makes every frigid Michigan January just a little warmer!"
""
""
"This was a HUGE letdown. It's not overly hoppy in the bitter sense (a la """Ruination""") or the floral/aromatic sense (a la """Bedlam""") """With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?""" I expected to get SLAMMED WITH HOPS! The honey pairs very, very well with the floral hops. This is good as a floral, honey IPA...but not a very awesome hop bomb."
"i got one bottle of this, and split it with the wife. pours a nice golden. its clear with a white head. the smell is odd, organic and pungent. the flavor is very full, piney, but not as bitter like a lot of ipa's. its like they bottled all that bitter flavor but made it drinkable. the finish isnt harsh at all, you can really taste the honey at the back. im sad i couldnt get more of this, and im sad i gave half of it away. bells makes pretty good beer, but honestly this IS something special."

"2014 Update: (score was 4.95 in 2013) not sure what happened with this years Hopslam but it just isn't as smooth as previous year. I don't find it as citrusy either. At first I thought maybe my taste has changed but I still feel the same about other seasonal IIPAs that I liked last year and still like this year. Maybe the hops pick too early or late but it definitely isn't the top of class anymore. Hopefully next year it will regain its form."
"Overall : Does it live up to the hype? Maybe not quite but is still a top tier dipa in my opinion."
""
""
"so glad that someone else had the same experience as i did. everyone holds this beer up so high, and they dont want to say anything negative about it, but i completely agree that this is a different tasting beer from years past. very disappointed in the 2013 hopslam. ive tried it from a bottle to snifter, and from draft as well. same response...disappointment especially for 11.oo for a pint. i can think of 15 other beers id prefer having before this one this year."

"Overall: I drank this after having a Lagunitas Sucks earlier in the evening, so I think I will go back and try it again all by its lonesome. I did enjoy it immensely but it was partly influenced by the overall nice time I was having with my husband and my best friends. If I can get my hands on it again, I will give it a proper taste test."
"Overall: This was my first slamdance and you can color me impressed. One of the best 2xIPAs I've ever had. Hype=earned. I drank this way too fast..."

"O-Great beer dangerously drinkable, needs to be serve at the right temp as it gets much better as it warms"
""
"O: I try not to buy into the hype, but it's hard not to with this one. It is a fantastic DIPA. I'm not the biggest fan of palate destroying, bitter IPA's, so the balance Bell's has created with this one makes this 10% DIPA very drinkable. It definitely leaves you wanting more, and I certainly understand the hype now. Unlike some DIPA's/IPA's I've had, this one is amazing from the first sip all the way down to the bottom of the glass!"
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer. It leaned more towards a catty flavor that I'm not fond of, then followed up with a ton of what tasted like citrus rind. I wouldn't say it's my favorite DIPA, but it's pretty good. I'm very surprised that it's 10% ABV because I didn't even check before drinking...and couldn't taste the alcohol at all. Although the flavors were not my favorite as hops are concerned (cat) there was quite a bit of hop flavor."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Of course, I relished the fact that I was finally getting to drink the fabled Hopslam, and it is an excellent beer indeed. I think my review bears that out. However, I do not rate it as highly as many on this site, and certainly do not think it is the best DIPA I have ever had, nor is it worth the price or an extended road trip to get it. While it is an excellent beer, I likely won't buy it again just because of the exorbitant markup and search process. Check it out, but this is certainly a case of too much hype, too much buildup, and unfortunately the brew could not possibly stand to compete."

"o: crisp and light for 10%, mixing nicely with the heaviness of the hops. simply excellent DIPA."
"O- After finishing half of the glass I'm still picking out little subtleties that pop out from the hop profile. This is the best DIPA that I've had, nearly perfect mouthfeel, hidden alcohol and a solid flavor profile. Worth seeking out."
"O - This brew is what ended up getting me into drinking true craft beer. I may be bias toward it but it is non the less one of my favorite Double IPA's even though it is ridiculously priced. I look forward to drinking this every year and so should you, cheers!"

"Have had this a few times in past years but never got around to reviewing this. Bad oversight, as this is a GREAT DIPA. Pours a cloudy orange with plenty of carbonation evident and a two-finger head that gradually gives way to a foamy coating. Lacing is perfect evidence of each sip. Nose is overwhelming citrus (especially orange, grapefruit and lemon), but hints of honey are there as promised. Taste: The one disagreement I would have with Stone is that his is NOT a """biting, bitter, tongue buster," although elements of each descriptor are there. I find it actually much better balanced than that, the honey backbone probably doing the most to sorta' tame these very wonderful hops. Taste is at first dominated by the citrus but this is so beautifully balanced by the honey and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium, and aftertaste is a sweet bitterness that is not overly cloying. Certainly, there is enough bitterness and dryness to satisfy DIPA fans but this is a VERY refreshing and crisp end to a very special beer. Come on, can't SOMEONE do this ALL YEAR? I LOVE this beer!"
""
""
"I would have given this beer all 5's, but with a beer touting the name """hopslam," I would expect it to be a little more bitter than it was. It did have a curiously sweet taste to it, and would definitely drink it again. Nice job Bell's."

I think the hop flavors are pleasing but don't play the main role as they should in a proper dipa. I like the beer, but I'm not sure if the hype is warranted. (2nd year in a row I just wasn't blown away)"

"I just had the 2013 release of Hopslam I was not overly impressed this year. Appearance and color where the same as other years but the aroma and taste were lacking compared to last year. I will still look for this on draft where I think it is much better. I must note that I did think the beer had a good flavor and my less than perfect review could be that my tastes are leaning more to hop forward beers and I would say I found this beer more balanced than I remember and not the Hopslam that I remember."
""
""
""
""
""
"For a beer that's called """hopslam", the bitterness was less than expected. Since it is brewed with honey, it is a fairly smooth pale ale taste. Smooth is a dangerous characteristic since its 10% ! Overall a very good beer, I'd like to try it on tap."
""
"O- Worth the price, well done Bell's. The only IPA I have had that could compete was Stone Enjoy By, which was probably just a little more hoppy and less malty. This is perhaps more complex, though."
""
"Served on tap as a """super premium""" at Papago Brewing Co in Scottsdale. Looks perfect, tastes perfect (the exact amount of honey sweetness to balance the hop bitterness), smells perfect. No bitter aftertaste and the 10% ABV is fast becoming the sweet spot for high alcohol ipa's that don't go too far overboard (I'm looking at you 120). Like April Fool's Day, July 4th Fireworks and hanging out with the guys on Labor Day for our fantasy football draft it is something I look forward to every year that rarely disappoints."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice opaque orange with a small white head, but nice lacing. Smell takes it away, lots and lots of citrus and piney hops, the smell just permeates the room from the time it is poured. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, and nice malt, but the honey taste helps to tie it all together and make it smooth. Beer has a bit of a fizzy feel, but for a beer with 10% ABV, goes down really smooth and is quite sessionable (and dangerous because of the high ABV). Overall, an excellent beer."
""
""
"Overall - Just like the bro's put I too have been HopSlammed ! This beer was a perfect combination of Bold yet Smooth, Hoppy yet Floral. I think its safe to say that I am in love..."
""
""
""
""
"O - Love this beer. Wonderful smell and flavor. Doesnt get any better than this for a imperial IPA! Cant wait to find it again!"

"First time that I have had this beer since probably 2009. The beer was a very nice, clear dark copper that produced a very nice white head that was well retained and faded into a thin cap that lasted throughout the beer. The aroma is very nice...actually more balanced than I remember, but still more hoppy, citrus and pine, but a very full and powerful aroma. The taste is what every DIPA/Imperial IPA should strive to be. Most are so overpowering hoppy that I sometimes regret getting them...but not this one, again, like the nose, pretty well balanced, but with an edge to the hops, but with more citrus up front and pine in the back and the malts just making it as smooth as it could be. The feel of the beer was also very good. The beer was clean, crisp, refreshing and very fresh. The alcohol was not noticeable at all and I probably would have had a few if not for the price. Overall, a world-class beer. Nothing more needs to be said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hopslam's appearance mirrors the sheen of untouched copper... and after looking upon it in my snifter, it now resembles pure honey, with an almost imperceptible haziness, and a fizzyness that quickly wanes to a thin ring of white around the perimeter of the glass. The aroma is enough to make me salivate! Contained within each whiff are the essences of clementines, zesty lemons, juicy red grapefruit, pungent resinous oils, wild honey and sap. Scents of boardwalk shop sweets and flower garden bouquets enter my imagination. The hop's bitterness and floral aspects court my tastebuds equally, then a second later, a super-sweet tingle of honey and pollen appears on the tip of my tongue, as if it were a finale. The brew gracefully coats the inside of the mouth, and it's warming on the way down. Very smooth and velvety... Despite the high ABV and dry finish, it is the antithesis of harsh, for sure. A mimicry of other popular DIPAs, this is certainly not. To say that each sip leaves me wanting more is an understatement... rather, I find myself unable to believe this otherworldly elixir is really in my grasp! I'd imagine this is what the great god Pan drank in the unspoiled wilderness of Arcadia!"
"This is a special Imperial IPA. Alcohol well hidden and very drinkable...almost sessionable. I proceded to buy bottles for future pleasures."
""
""
"A terrific brew, but not the best of the best even though I had to go behind the counter at total wine to find one. Biggest weakness is the taste doesn't follow the nose because it is a bit too sweet and dumbed down by something, either the honey or the malts or both. Not as """biting""" as advertised, does not live up to the hype surrounding it, but still quite tasty and drinkable and a must try for lovers of Two Hearted and other floral IPAs."
""
"Love love love BEll's Hopslam Ale! To me, the combination of the honey with the hoppiness creates a perfect balance in the taste. It is smoother than Two-Hearted, for example, and the overall richness of the flavors makes this a top-tier brew for me. The look is a nice golden hue with hints of amber (again, balance is evident). The smell is not enticing to me, the feel and, again, taste more than make up for that. I love this beer; you should,too."
""
"Love the IPA, my favorite. I let this chill in my freezer because i was in a hurry to try it. Cooled it to 46F. (Get a laser temp device, they're cheap and accurate). First impression on tasting was the hops, of course. The citrus and carmel sweet came after, but the hops didn't let go. I was impressed by the 20 proof factor, but wondering about how much taste that would hide. Actually, the crafting of this brew made the alc content undetectable. Yep, this one will sneak up on you. I compare this with other IPA brews that have the same flavor but with half of the kick. The head seems to go kinda quick, but with a flavor like this one, I'm good with that. Be careful with this one, young man."
""
""
"Overall: An incredible imperial ipa. Very reminiscent of Sierra Nevada's hoptimum. I love how bitter and drinkable this is. An outstanding IPA. I usually like them extremely fruity but this one is perfect."
""
"yeah, a perfect 5, this is what it takes to get one of those from my tastebuds and my nose, and any brewery that makes complicated IPA's like this gets my upvotes and money!"
""

""

""
""
""
"Overall one of the best DIPA out there get all you can while the supply lasts. I had my last one in early January a year after i got it. still good. Now I have about 4 cases to ponder over the next year. unless someone wants a bottle or two. A must seek out or travel to get some."
""
"Pours cloudy orange with one finger white head. Head dissipates to thin cap leaving nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of peaches, honey and orange blossoms. Flavor is sweet and citrusy with bitter finish. Medium body with light carbonation. Perfect balance of rich malt and bitter hops. A very refreshing easy to drink DIPA."
"Overall this is an amazing, aptly named, imperial assault on the enamel on my teeth. One of the great examples of the diversity of DIPAs out there. How does this rank among the other top rated DIPAs? I put it in my top 5 or 10. I wish it was priced lower but it's still worth the money, at least to splurge for a 6-pack every year."
"O - A must try, it is not for everyone, but I think this is a great beer that may not all the way live up to the hype. But if one were to stumble onto this beer, it would be a very pleasant surprise."
""
""
""
"I hate to be that guy, but this years batch just doesn't compare. Head/lacing sucks, aromatics and flavor are just not there.  Mouthfeel is stickier than ever.  ATL market received this beer Wednesday, I'm enjoying it on Friday.  This is not the hopslam I used to love."
""
""
"Overall - a TRUE gem"
""
"Carbonation is pretty moderate. Mouthfeel is just slightly sticky. Overall, it really is an awesome beer. So balanced, so tasty. Just don't buy it expecting have your palate blown to smithereens by hops cuz it ain't gonna happen with this one."
""
"O - Simply amazing from start to finish, and one of the best IPA's around. Very limited in my area, and a little expensive, but worth the trouble and expense. A masterpiece."
""
""
"Suffice it to say, I really like this beer, but am glad it isn't a year-around thing. I would probably become tired of quite quickly."

"O - Overall one wonders if this beer is worthy of the cult like following. Tough call but I can tell you it is a pretty nice DIPA if you're a hophead with taste for the tropical variety you will surely be satisfied. I will be among the followers next year."
"O - Yes it is very good. Excellent DIPA. But this Event release date status it has gotten - way over hyped. That being said - i will continue to order it when i see it."
""
"O - This is one of the best balanced DIPAs I've had. It still delivers on hop flavor without becoming syrupy and too sweet. Yet there's still low bitterness. If you're new to IPAs or hoppy beers this would be great for you I'd imagine. Highly recommended. That said, don't go out of your way to get it. If you're going to trade for a DIPA there are a lot of better options IMO."
""
"With an ABV at 10 percent, there no alcohol bite but a pleasant warmth in the chest. Very smooth and easy this is a pleasant hoppy ale."
""
" A balance in extremes, in a sense. The sweetness of the malt juxtaposes the bitterness of the hops, and the hop flavor is excellent, albeit not as complex as some of the newer hop varieties."

" Overall this beer is worth the 17.95 I paid for the 6 pack , I only wish I could get my hand on more of this. I will purchase this by the case if possible and share with friends."
"I have been reading about this beer. My first Imperial IPA. I was impressed actually i am In Love..A great Pour, beautiful color, carbonation, and taste. This beer jumps all over your face and leaves you smiling. One was about all you need this beer is a keeper! Can't wait to have my Buddy taste it!"
"overall, extremely high drink ability, especially considering the ABV. I'm not a huge hop head, but if you are, check this one out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was somewhat underwhelmed by this beer. Hopslam did not live up the hype that surrounds it in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it's quite a tasty beer and if it was available locally I'd purchase it again, but I will not go through the trouble of seeking it out. Definitely worth a try, but don't over trade or go crazy trying to find it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great IPA that I could see myself getting in trouble with because the alcohol content is hidden very well. I'm already planning on going to get more."
"Overall: This is the first time I've ever tried this beer, and I got to say it was worth the wait. I've had IPAs I've enjoyed more but this one is among the elites. Lots of hype but certainly lots of awesomeness."
""
""
""
""
"Wow top notch. Really packs a lot of flavor and a really good drinkability, I gotta a 6 last year and that was enough for me, but this year I will grab 2 or 3 for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: It's fantastic, but it lacks the pungency I remember from last year. I had this immediately upon receipt and again later next to Pliny the Younger; it doesn't measure up like it used to. I won't say it's bad, but I rearranged my top 5 a bit. I don't think I'll track down a case next year, maybe just one six-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has got to be one of the most powerful beers that I have ever tasted. I tried a Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale (which is a beer that I enjoy) afterwards to compare and Hopslam made SI Celebration Ale seem/taste like a run of the mill Brown Ale. Hopslam is an amazing beer all the way around. The flavors are full and robust to say the least. I hope to drink some more this weekend at the Beer Dabbler in St. Paul, MN."
""

"Overall - Really great beer from Bell's. Will look forward to this one's release every year that's for sure. Recommend that anyone try whether you love IPA's or just like them."

"O-IPA's aren't my favorite style (I more like malt forward stouts/porters/barleywines), Hopslam is something that begs for more."
""
"O: Very solid. I was expecting to be blown away by this after hearing about its anticipation for so long so I suppose I was slightly disappointed but it was a fantastic DIPA. I'd still put sucks ahead of this and categorize this with Hoptimum. Would seek out again for the price."
""
"Overall: My palate has clearly adjusted to all kinds of DIPAs over the past year and I still find this beer to be incredibly bitter. It's not juicy as I'd like though the sweetness does help cut into the hoppiness. For what it is, it's a solid value but I probably won't buy a full sixer again."

""
""
""
""
"The first few times I had this I loved it, but year after year I try Hopslam and I keep coming to the same conclusion that it is simply ok. I like to have a pint and a bottle or two each year just for kicks, but plopping down close to $20 for a six pack just ain't gonna happen."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: A DIPA of the juicy and sweet variety, but with bit of dryness from the honey. Very nice."
""
""
""
"O- so my first few I've drank through the week I thought it was a bit over rated. After sitting down and picking it apart, I realize this is one of the most enjoyable IPAs I've ever had, the honey gives it a nice district flavor without making it sweet and the flavors compliment eachother perfectly. I can't believe how drinkable this is for a 10% abv beer. Worth the large price tag ."

"1-21-14: Delicious again this year, but an expensive 6pk. Citrus, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple, sticky buns, dank... intense hop flavor, & aromas. Smooth, creamy yet warm on the tongue... easy to quaff for a dipa."
""
"O- Complex flavor and smell which hides the alcohol content, very nice feel. Appearance is just a shade south of great, but by no means poor. Do try this beer. Not as hoppy as other DIPAs, but the honey may play a role in that."

"O: The honey is much more present in 2013 than 2012, but I like it. The sweetness comes through without losing any hoppiness. A 10% ABV brew should not be """seshy""" but this one is darn close. In general, if you pay attention to the forums on BA a lot of beers tend to be """overhyped""". This one is actually one of the few that meets that """hype""". I'm impressed."
""
""
"O: Such a tasty beer. The balance of this beer is what makes it so great. perfect blend of malt and hops makes this such a sought after beer. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"Incredibly fresh. Credit to Bell's. 8 day old beer. Poured into Bell's tulip glass. Nice bright white one finger head. Lightly orange color. You can smell the hops immediately. Light citrus scents hit your nose then your palate prior to a light bitterness. Almost a sweet bitterness. You really get the carbonation and fresh hop flavor in the mouthfeel. You get a slight smell of the alcohol but it certainly doesn't taste if 10%. Be careful. It is just that good."
"Pours a deep golden amber with some orange highlights, topped with a fluffy clean white two finger head. Above average retention, some wispy lacing evident. Honey and citrus blossoms present on the nose. Opens with smooth honey notes, some light caramel, flora and hay, citrus and even a hint of apple and pear-like fruitness. More honey notes head off and smooth out some mounting citrus rind bitterness. Smooth, slightly chewy due to a hefty malt backbone and honey-like syrupy accents. Moderate carbonation. Such a unique, exceptionally great beer that I'm glad to finally fully review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This stuff is so delicious! Widely available and affordable at only $14.99/6. This may be the closest thing to a perfect beer. Whatever you do, don't pass this up!"
""
"Too many times Double IPAS are unbalanced, tongue numbing, unpleasant beers for me, but Hopslam shows a true balance of hop in beautiful form."
""
""
""
"Overall: Well worth $18/6-pack. A real treat to drink fresh. Given how fresh, this would probably sneak into my top 5 DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer packs a punch! If you're a hophead you have to get your hands on this. However, I believe that a good beer isn't rated on just its IBU, and beers need a medium of flavors. This beer delivered a punch, but lacked complexity on a taste level. Great beer nonetheless."
""

"Overall, this is the second year I've had this and while it didn't blow me away the first time, I found myself really enjoying and appreciating it's uniqueness this second time around. It's a very sweet but well-made double IPA."
"o - a top notch DIPA. it's crazy how drinkable this is for 10% ABV. Gotta thank my work buddy Phil for hooking me up with a couple bottles as I missed out on buying any this year."
"O- EASILY earns it's high rating. 10% ABV is so hidden be careful. Would gladly pay the pricey $18 for another 6 pack. Drink it, it's great."
"(4.75/5)"
"The sensation as the cool glass touches my lips, followed quickly by the rushing wave of ecstasy too sweet to call bitter, my tongue explodes forth. Every sense I contain is elated as heaven travels downward, warming me to the core. I am satisfied, I am whole."
""
""
"Overall: Phenomenal. Again, if you're looking for a DIPA with huge hop bitterness, look elsewhere (I would recommend Surly Abrasive). But in my opinion this offers one of the best overall hop profiles out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A real pleasure. I am going back tomorrow to get more. Hopefully they aren't sold out!"

"I just tried this beer out of the bottle and really enjoyed it. The name says it all. A hoppy beer with attitude. Even though you can strongly taste the hops, I can't believe that is has an ABV of 10%. A great tasting beer that I would love to try on tap."
""
"O - Overall, a great DIPA, but not as legendary as what everybody makes it out to be. This one goes to 11 beats it any day."
"Final Thoughts: To someone who's new to IPAs or DIPAs they may think Hopslam tastes like a liquid pine tree. However, a more informed palate would note that it strikes a near perfect balance in flavor and delivers a pleasant drinking experience. Would I drink it again? Hell yes, it is deserving of its near legendary status in the world of craft beer."

"beautiful looking beer, poured aggressive, got a massive head that dissipated down to a 3 and 1/2 finger. beautiful orange, golden where light shines through. This beautiful beer smells honestly like a fruit cocktail cup. Fruity and delicious. first flavor is wildflower honey, apricot, peach, sweet orange, little bit of alcohol in the flavor, finishes with grapefruit in the back of my throat. very delicious."
"Overall, Hopslam is amazing. Having enjoyed both formats, draft and bottle, I am grateful for the experience. Over the last year, it has made me chase """honey beers""" only to be disappointed. Bell's did a great job, and I feel like this year is better than last. Please find the chance to sample this excellent brew. It is definitely different, draft v. bottle, and I think it's hitting its stride right now, 9-10 days in. Glad I have a chance to drink 1/day for the next 2.5 weeks, and hopefully I can grab some more to see how it changes after several weeks. Again, must try. Cheers."
""
""
"Medium body and carbonation, almost light for this style. This is a top notch DIPA, sure, but not perhaps in the class of the other heavy hitters of the genre; lacks the intricacy of Heady Topper and the refinement of Pliny, to cite two examples. But still dusts the vast majority of the competition."
"O-A really good DIPA, the honey is a nice addition but not crazy about it. Will keep trying this beer was I was expecting a little more out of it."
"The smell was phenomenal, I think this year's hopslam was much more well balanced than last years. Less Malt, more hops, and floral undertones this year I think. Tons of it up here in MIchigan this year, one store had 120 cases I went to the other day and on tap all over the place."

"Hopslam is, simply put, one of the best DIPAs in the world. A fantastic hop profile that gives off an orgasmic aroma and a wonderfully complex yet drinkable flavor profile. Despite the 10% ABV, the alcohol does nothing more than provide a teeny, tiny bit of warmth. One of the most drinkable DIPAs you'll ever find. If you're looking for a hop explosion, look no further - get yourself some HOPSLAM."
"One of the best IIPAs out there. Get it if you can!"

"Poured this Imperial IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a amber color, produced a nice foamy cream colored head, nice retention and off the charts lacing left on the glass. This ale featured an aroma of floral/citric hops, clover honey and malted grain. Medium in body, this IIPA starts off a bit thin/light, and then packs a punch! Sweet malted grain, honey, and an explosion of citric hops. Hop filled finish, strong taste of alcohol. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel- One of the most drinkable IIPA's i have ever had. You could actually have a few of these in one session. Shot out to my boy the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit for bringing me a bottle of this beautiful libation.. I have been Hopslammed! Prost!"

"355 mL. Pours a translucent light orange with a fluffy, off-white head that settles down. Not too much lacing. Aromas of wet hops, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel, white sugar. Taste is beautifully smooth and not too heavy with lots of grapefruit, citrus hops, orange blossom honey, and some butter. Rich and slightly oily on the palate but finishes clean with a quick spicy and acidic bite akin to ginger. Very easy to enjoy. Overall very well balanced for the amount of hops dumped into the vats. 10% abv is masterfully hidden. Awesome. 1/27/2009 9/4/9/4/16=4.2"

"Definitely one of my favorite beers, this strong DIPA has some serious flavor. It has a nice deep golden color and a great combination of hops with a wonderful mix of honey and a hint of citrus and pine. It plays to all of your senses and while it may be 10.5% it never gets too harsh on your taste buds."
""
""
""

"Taste is bam!! Up-front assault of hops and then the honey smooths it out just as I sense the booze. I'm realizing this is about the best DIPA I've ever had at or above 10% abv. I admit I didn't expect the honey to play as big a role in the flavor as it does. I'm going to sip this one slow and savor it. It feels quite thick, as though it should due to that honey aspect of the brew. Sticky as it begins to warm. Although in the end I prefer more piney/ pineapple/ citrus flavored DIPAs over this, Bell's did as good a job as I can imagine anyone can do with regards to marrying honey to beer and having it all balance out with the big hop flavors like this. For me, the honey gave me the impression of an elixir, but in a very good way. My wife, who hates beer, was on hand and I had her sip this. I asked if she tasted the honey. """No""" she said..."""but I smelled it""". Then I asked """well, what does it taste like?""" ..she said """beer... bitter", as she made her usual unpleasant face as she always does after reluctantly trying beer. I then took a couple more sips as it's even warmer now, and there's orange citrus in there too. Syrupy. For a big imperial IPA, sweet. But for what I understand this retails for, this is very good bang for your buck. "

"If I were stranded on an island and only had one beer I could take with me (along with food, of course ;)), this would be it. Well done, Bell's. Of course it would have to be on tap because this stuff is LEGIT coming from a keg. Bottles are good too, but this beer really shines on tap."

"Finally, I get to do a full written review of this incredible brew. Pours a nice honey color, with an inch foam head, beautiful lacing. The scent is wonderful, well balanced citrus, hops, and honey. The taste is, oh my, incredible. This is definitely one of my top beers, for sure. It hits hard, but is perfectly balanced in such a way as to not reveal much alcohol taste at all. Honey, hops, and citrus dominate the taste in a wonderful array on the tongue that is neither too biting nor too quick to leave, it unfolds on the palate revealing the complexity of the hops. If you can find this, don't hesitate to pick some up."
"Overall: This beer definitely wowed me fresh. If it wasn't for the price point, I'd buy this all the time."
""
""
"O - Overall, after writing this review, I already wish I had some more. Hopslam gets a lot of hype, but in my opinion, it is justified."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful beer. 10% and ready for the taking. Not sure if it's one to start the night with, but mix it in after a ocuple and perfecto!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - honestly I was expecting more based on it's reputation. A very good DIPA, and I'd certainly seek it out again. But not a top ten for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The guys and gals at Bell's should be congratulated on this one. I can tell a lot of careful thought went into selecting the ingredients for this beer (rather than just chucking a ton of different hops into a strong pale ale base)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a personal favorite of this reviewer, and it never fails to satisfy. It really has everything a drinker looks for in this style, plus an amazing addition in the honey, which balances this into one of the most drinkable DIPAs on the market. One must be very careful drinking these because of the ease that they keep going down, and the hurting another six-pack will put on the pocketbook. 19/20"

"O- This was a very good DIPA that's a little bit different then the Northeast IPAs I'm used to due to the addition of the honey. The DIPA has a nice sweet taste that is well balanced between the hops and the honey. It's very hard to tell that this beer is 10%, it is hidden very well. I still prefer beers like Heady Topper, HF IPAs, etc. a little bit better, but this DIPA was great non-the-less. The bottles I had were a bit past there prime so the hops faded a little bit, but they were still very good."
"O: An outstanding robust IPA. Great hops bite and bitterness with just enough malt sweetness to take the harsh edge off the bitterness. The honey sweetness also fits well and adds a unique flavor. The alcohal heat at just the right level to compliment the citrus and floral hops and bitterness. This is one of the best IPA's around."

"I read all about how hardly anything can beat fresh Hopslam, and I have reason to believe those people are on to something. I just wish I could get some Hopslam that is fresh."

"was expecting more hops than sweet honey in this one , but still one to drink again when i get a chance, lets say that i wanted more from this beer. like more bitter finsh considering the name.it kind of reminding me a little like lucky 13.alt from laguntias"
""
""
"O- I would be surprised if there was a more hop forward, hop dominated beer."
"Aroma is slightly grassy and floral with hints of honey coming through. Pours a nice light orange color and white head. Taste is pretty amazing, I'm not typically a grassy hop person, but the balance of hops they used, the floral notes went really well with the honey and sweet caramel malt bill on this one. Fairly bitter but expected and I really think they nailed the malts on this one to give it a complexity you don't get much with some DIPAs, mouthfeel is a little less drinkable as it's got a good amount of body to this beer. Great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
"However a word of warning; when beginning your beer journey this is no entry level IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nose of pine and resin, slightly floral with a sticky sweetness backing it up. Tastes of heavy hitting pine hops up front backed up by orange-lemon citrus bitterness all balanced by a honey sweetness. You get a nice warm tingle deep down inside from the alcohol, but none of the boozey heat in the taste. This lives up to all the hype I've heard. Fan-freakin-tastic."
"Revised, fresher review: OK, so I'm trying an eight day old Hopslam, and I've changed my mind. I wish I could have one of these every day. Now I get even more fruit, passionfruit, and maybe even guava, and I can't believe this is 10% ABV. So a I go from a previous 4.75 to a almost 5.00. This one is near perfect for me."

"originally reviewed: 02-21-2011"
"Comes out of the tap a pretty clear, dark amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is monumentally hoppy, promising a serious IPA. Flavor is hoppy in the extreme, making this beer taste like a liquid pine tree. There is just a hint of honey sweetness that nicely offsets the firm but not fierce bitterness. Texture is rough and tingly, leaving behind a strong fizz. Recommended to all hop-heads."

"Poured this beer into a Tulip glass. It poured a Light gold color with a decent head. From the time I opened the bottle until I was finished I could smell the beautiful hop aroma. Good lacing through the glass. The taste starts with a small dose of sweetness, but that moves out of the way for the hops to come through in a hurry. I got a lot of citrus hops in this one. It was smooth to drink and went down easy. I will be looking for a fresher bottle of this next year to get a more accurate rating, but still a great beer."
""
""
"O- Fantastic beer, but as a DIPA named """Hopslam""" I would expect a less """balanced""" beer. The back of the bottle reads: """A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale.""" This is a bit of a stretch. Don't get me wrong, this is a BIG hoppy beer but the amount of residual malt & honey sweetness definitely detracts from the huge complex bitter hop profile. At 10%, this beer goes down with some ease, it would be real easy to get carried away with a few of these. Big up Bell's for creating this masterpiece!"
"Honestly... it's world class. There's a reason it's a 99 (or was at the time!) on BeerAdvocate... awesome DIPA."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Ov: A lot of hype going into this one, and Hopslam certainly did not disappoint. Truly one of the best beers I've ever had. Probably the best DIPA I've had to this point. Bell's please come to Buffalo!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Yup, still as good as last year's. This beer delivers and it's dangerously drinkable for 10%!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - At first I didnt like this beer. Too malty, not enough ops. As I drank though it grew on me. Nice honey sweetness and good bitter pine finish. Would like to try this fresh and see how it compares as I believe the hops have definitely faded with the 5 months of age."
""
""
""
""
"Edit. Had this on tap at House of 1000 Beers in PA, the 2013 first batch is really lacking in aroma and hop character I recall from previos batches. Getting downgraded for now"

"As much as I have always enjoyed Bell's Hopslam, I can't help but say of it that it's the right size but the wrong shape. What I mean by that is that it has the right amount of bitter, tropical, herbal hoppiness but it all falls way to an overall toasty, sweet, and malty persona. Relative to similar stock in Bells lineup (and hype), it falls short of expectation."
"This beer goes off the shelves fast. There's like a Hopslam cult or something. 6 packs sell in DC for $24-$30. I got a case of it passing through Donora Pa for $58. That was after calling at least 100 places to see if it was in stock. I first tried it when I bought 2 bottles of it on Ebay for $30+$10 shipping. Crazy. Great beer tho! Def one of my favs! A very comparable beer is Hoptimum, by Sierra Nevada. This is the 2nd year for it and it's starting to sell like Hopslam. Hoppy beer is addicting!"

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an SA glass. Freshness, or born on date listed on bottle. Pure golden amber with one finger head that receded into nice cap. Full lacing down the sides. Smells like a freshly harvested bale of hay from a flowery field. A mouthful of grass and resin is the first hint that fades into pepper. The taste is wonderful! Medium-bodied with medium carbonation, just a hint of alcohol which is not bad for a 10% abv beer. Searched far and high before I finally found this beer offered. It met all my expectations! Truly one of the best beers I've ever had! RB!"

"Bottle dated 1/10/12 poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a clear dark orange with a 2 finger white head that shrinks to cover the top. nice lacing. Aroma is pine, mango, pineapple, apricot, and more tropical fruit. Flavor is pine resin, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, mango, and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat sticky. Alcohol is invisible. Amazing beer."

"IMO. There really isn't too much to say about this brew than as follows. This is the best IPA that has ever touched my mouth. You folks that are stating that it doesn't live up to it's """hype", obviously like an IPA that is way different than my likeing. All is good though, it has everything that a good beer has to offer. WELL DONE Bells. You guys hit this one right on the head while crafting this masterpiece. It's making my mouth water thinking about it."
""

""

"Pours a copper color with a rather creamy looking white head, carbonation is evident. Very slightly opaque as far as clarity goes. Head is retained until the end. Smells almost as hoppy as the name implies; more earthy and spicy notes than floral. Malt aroma is almost undetectable, but overall a rather appealing smell. Flavor is very hop forward as expected, almost too overwhelming on the tongue to pick apart. Finish starts with pronounced bitterness, followed by a not unflattering pine resin(y) taste accompanied by an almost barlywine-like malt flavor with a bit of alcohol in the nose. Lacks balance in my opinion. For a beer that looked rather over carbonated after pouring, I have to say the mouth feel was great. Good viscosity, and definitely not over-carbonated. I realize with a name like hop slam, that some intense hoppyness should be expected. But more goes into a great beer than a ridiculous amount of hops. I've had quite a few IPA's that did a much better job of showcasing the hops used. Anyway, hop slam is alright, nothing great though."
"O: Hop bomb that showcases several hop characteristics. Very nice balance, although I would prefer just a tad more malt to support the huge hops."
"On my first experience, I was not overwhelmed by this beer. I found myself more impressed after a year away from it."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and though it didn't blow my mind, it certainly could fight for a rank among the top 15 or so DIPAs on the market. Give it a try if you can."
"O: Still not perfect, but greatly improved from my first rating experience. And, I'm an honest guy. I give credit where credit is due. I would definitely drink this again, and recommend to people."

"I had been waiting to try this beer for a very loooong time... Unable to get it in Virginia, because of the speed with which the few cases that did show up here, sold out. A friend left me one on the porch Tuesday whilst I was feeling a bit """under the weather""". I cracked it open that night with dinner, and all I have to say is """WOW!", it was well worth the wait and the hype. If you are a true hophead, then you must get your hands on this."

"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a light orange with about a finger of white head. Aroma of citrus and honey. Taste is about the same. Medium bodied with a somewhat sticky texture. Lively carbonation and a long finish. Overall, pretty good. I would gladly drink again in the future."

"Overall a great drink, would love to try again hopefully fresher to compare. Definitely surprises at 10%!"

"O: I've had this before, just now giving a proper review. It's a very tasty beer, not sure it quite lives up to the hype (this year or any other year), but still something I'll pick up when it's available for sure."
"Overall: I can see why so many people seek this one out. It is like I said a nice change of pace for this style with the added honey sweetness. It is so dangerously drinkable at 10%."
""
""
"O: A great beer. Pretty pricey where I'm buying but definitely worth a try if you've got the money. I'm now convinced I should add some of that honey to my own homebrew dipa, it definitely adds a great dimension to the Hopslam."
""
""
""
"O: Truly a great beer. Probably my favourite Double IPA. Great balance despite the huge hop presence. Hopslam has my highest recommendation. I will [edit: have] drink again. This is a beer to seek out or stand in line for. Perhaps the perfect example of the style."
"Was grateful to have had this beer. The hops are beautiful in the aroma and in the taste. What's even better is how the hop profile changes as you drink this. The front is of great hops; grapefruit and pine. The hops quickly fades and becomes quite mellow on the finish. The honey comes through after, but its not as prevalent as I hoped."
"O: I love this. As mentioned above, definitely my top 5 DIPAs. Highly recommended."

"Had my first Hopslam on tap at a BW3's in Troy, OH and fell in love. Have had a case purchased and delivered to me each year after since I can't get it easily in VA. Pours a beautiful orange/gold color with a bit of a haze and a nice fluffy head. Smells wonderful if you're a hop-head. The taste of this stuff really puts it on top of my list of favorites. Taste is super hoppy and citrusy and then the honey sweetness settles into the after-taste. But, remarkably smooth for a big beer. Mouthfeel has a nice cling and coat type feel on the inside of the mouth so the flavor lingers. Easily my favorite DIPA/Imperial IPA and quite possibly my favorite beer."

"Purchased a six pack of this beer a few weeks ago and drank four since. Really really nice and smooth. I was surprised that this beer was 10% ABV. Really enjoyed this beer. Citrusy, big, big! HOPS!! Pours a nice golden copper. A had one ice cold, one slightly chilled, and one at room temp. I think this beer is best with a slight chill. Too cold and you lose some of the smooth flavors in this beer. If you can find some, grab a few and enjoy!!!"

"O - I'm a fan of the bottled version, but not nearly as much as the draft pour I had near Philly. On tap, this beer is absolutely jaw-dropping. The tropical notes are much more pronounced. I'd still trade for a few fresh bottles each year though. Bottled, it drinks much more like a honey-infused version of Two-Hearted. Go Bells Go!"

"O - Probably one of the best Imperial IPAs i've had. A fine balance is struck between the hops, sweetness and alcohol. Hard to find even when it's released in MI - Don't hesitate to grab if you're a hop-head."

"Pours a hazy copper color with a lingering off white head. The scent is oh so hoppy! Lots of bitter hops with hints of citrus and wheat. The initial sip starts out slightly bitter and gradually builds up and finishes quite dry and bitter. This is perhaps the smoothest most drinkable IIPA I have ever had. Some floral and fruity hints in the mix as well. Full of flavor and well worth paying a little extra for. Hopslam is a must try!"
"O. Is this beer worthy of the praise of the beer gods? Yes! Is it the really that special? Probably not but still a damn good drink!"

"Truly a world-class beer. For 70 IBU, 10% abv, is this exceptionally drinkable. Scrap that- for any beer, this is exceptionally drinkable- assuming that you are an IPA fan. Resinous, chewy (did I really just say that?), bitter but not too bitter, malty but not too malty- Bells got it right once again. The biggest selling point here is not that the flavor is exceptional but, rather, that such a big beer can be so easy to drink. Pair it with a glass while dinner is cooking; this one is great on its own."

"IF YOU LIKE HOPPY BEERS THIS IS A REALLY AWESOME SMELLING BEER! THE NAME SPEAKS FOR IT SELF IT IS EXTREMLY HOPPY AND IT PACKS A PUNCH MEANING IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE BEER. I JUST LOVE IT CAN NOT GET ENOUGH. ONE OF THE BEST BEERS I EVER HAD."

"Overall a highly drinkable, very tasty and very hoppy DIPA. Glad I picked up as much as I did."

"poured a hazy orange/yellow with a very small amount of head. smells very sweet like candy but with a hint of bitterness rising from the hops. taste is bitter, but sweet enough to balance it out (until the bitterness of the aftertaste kicks in!). definitely taste the sweetness from the honey, a fruity banana taste to it as well. a bit heavy on mouthfeel - a little too rich and creamy for the weather right now (70 and sunny outside), bitter but smooth going down. this is a great iipa, of course it's way hyped by beer geeks which makes me a bit turned off, but after giving it a try, it was a great beer. i wouldn't call it the best for its style, it could use a bit of work on the appearance and the smell (not too many different things going on there and not a great deal of hop aromas either)"
"O - possibly best double ipa ever, i will edit this when i have some pliny's or hill farmstead"
""
""
""
"O - One of the best DIPA's out there. I would put this one just behind Surly Abrasive. I absolutely love the honey addition. Its not incredibly pronounced, but it adds a little extra sweetness to accompany the great citrusy hops and caramel malt notes."

"D ~ Extremely hoppy & resinous, but with a redeeming finish. Thank you Crabbicus!!!"

"O- This is a good beer. It is an excellent beer in-fact. However, I'm not sure that it is a 99 out of 100. I really love the complexity of the flavor profile, but the aromas were just a touch muted in my opinion. Still awesome, and I encourage anyone who has the chance to try one to do it. Awesome beer, but as is usually the case with these things, the hype just slightly overpowers the real thing."

"The only problem here is the sweetness being over-bearing, and not being big on sweet beer, it knocks this down a notch for me. That and it's very expensive at ~$20 a 6-pack. Still, it is extremely tasty, and something I would try again, but not a favorite."

"I'll be buying this again."

"Crisp, clean, finish considering the stature of this beer. Slight lingering bitterness and sweetness but it's plenty expected and perfectly managed. Overall this is a superb specimen of an overly hopped but perfectly balanced alpha acid bombs. Will continue drinking and pursuing this one indefinitely."

"O - as far as DIPAs go, this to me is second only to PtE. Great beer, it makes me love this time of year."
""
"After much searching found the last two sixers around DC. Well worth it for this incredible beer. Great citrus and bitter balance. Smooth going down and packs a kick. Overall I would recommend finding this beer to all HopHeads that haven't tried it yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heck of a ballsy and charismatic IIPA bursting with flavour and begging to be drunk."
""
"That being said, this beer is ridiculous. It's so smooth and balanced without any hint of alcohol in the taste, but you know it's there when you start to hit the bottom of your glass. There is a ton of complexity without any overpowering flavors, something that is hard to find with a lot of DIPAs. I would definitely look for this again and I'm glad I have a 6-pack."
""
"O: Honestly, I don't like jumping on bandwagons, but there is no argument to be had here. This is by far one of the more quality beers you can get out there."
""
""
"Pours an orange amber color, carbonation can be seen rising in the body. There is just a slight haziness. The head stands about one finger tall and is an off white color. Smell is of grapefruit, pineapple, and a slight malt sweetness. Taste has a strong bitterness, I get flavors of citrus: pineapple and grapefruit. I also get some honey, malt sweetness and a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thickish, which is expected. This is a great DIPA."
"I am not typically a huge hops fan, but I am trying to gain exposure to a number of different hoppy beers to find one that is for me. Hopslam was definitely enjoyable: The initial gut punch was enjoyable and I could definitely taste the honey. By the end of the bottle, my mouth was just too tired, though. Maybe I just wasn't ready for it yet, I'll try another one in a few months!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I have been waiting to try this for some time as they do not sell it in my neck of the woods. A freind from Ohio brought up a six pack this weekend and I was not disapointed, one of the best DIPA's I have ever had, amazing how it is 10abv and not boozy whatsoever, also the hops are wonderfully balanced."
""
""
""
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. It honestly drinks like a 6 or 7 percent beer. The fruitiness is also very nice. A truly world class beer and I'm glad I was able to snag a 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had many DIPA's in my time. This one is pretty good, but doesn't stand up to the elite DIPA's. The nose and the taste just seemed held back a little. With a bit more boldness, this could hold its own when compared to the best in this style."
""
""
"The fact this beer is """supposedly""" 10% is mind boggling. This is really a masterpiece. I want this all the time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a reason for thy hype of this beer. Its one of the best DIPA's out there."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent DIPA. Glad to finally be able to try it. Hopslam can count me in as a fan."
""
""
"2013 note - Not as hoppy as I remember. Still a really solid beer but it seems muted and its was only bottled 20 days ago. Maybe its just that my beer tastes are developing and after having Pliny and heady this doesn't seem like them."
"I paid $8 for a 7 ounce snifter. And then I bought two more. That is kind of unheard of. But this is pretty much the best I've had. Amazing citrus beginning combined with the perfect combo of Hops and Malt. My favorite bar is out of it and I'm disappointed I'll need to wait until next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very good IPA, is fairly fresh but would love to try this a bit fresher. Certainly a must have. I look forward to trying it again."
"I really liked the aroma, but that phenolic plastic aftertaste really buried this one for me. I got this in a trade, so I'm really hoping this one was sitting in the sun or something because this has a lot of potential. FYI, I wouldn't normally give something I suspect to be """damaged goods""" a review, but I really don't have any other means by which to review this beer. This is more for my notes so i can go back and try it fresh in Chicago one day to compare. Gotta say though, even with the plastic phenol taken away, it's pretty syrupy. After the DIPA fest, I can say I've had several beers that lack this characteristic that still fit the TIPA style. So I guess I'm saying that my below average review is still warranted in my eyes."

"If I was going to be banished to a desert island for eternity with just one thing to drink for the rest of my days, this would be my choice. So good...such a reminder of why I'm here in the first place."

"Pours a golden honey with a subtle haze that clears with some warmth. Finger of white head comes with a vigorous pour. Decent, spotty lacing. Typical west coast IIPA on the nose - big on the citrus and mango, backed up with some pine and subtle malt support, more boozy than some. Leans more towards fruit on the tongue with less herbal/pine hop presence. Fades off into some soft booze notes, and a tiny sting on the back of the palate at the very end. Mouthfeel is as expected - medium everything. Appropriate for the style. Overall it’s a good double IPA. I wouldn’t say it’s worth the hype and the price but it’s good. EDIT: Just got a sixer with a 2/10 bottle date - a month fresher than the batch I reviewed initially. Much more interesting. The honey is a bit sweeter and better incorporated. I’ll adjust my numbers somewhat, but not too much because I don’t feel that any beer should suffer that much from 4 extra weeks in the bottle. I’d probably seek this out year after year if I was guaranteed the fresh stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A beer well-worth trekking for and/or seeking out. Easily one of the best in class. A treasure that I'll seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very tasty DIPA that would be really world class if the alcohol bite on the end wasn't there or as strong. Maybe a touch better than Double Trouble, though I think it still pales a bit in comparison to the big boy DIPAs out of VT."
"Overall – This was a nice imperial IPA. It had great aromas flavor and mouthfeel. One to look for and one to sit back and savor."
"O: Simply put...One of the best Double IPAs that I've had."
""
"Cheers!"
"O-Glad I had another chance to try this and hope to have again soon!"
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer, but not as amazing as people make it IMO."
"Overall: It should say something that I have tried both 90 Minute IPA and Dreadnaught (also stellar Imperial IPAs) and was moved enough to review this one first. I'm too new to the style to say if it's worth the hype, but I'm glad I got the sixer. Beware the insane drinkability, 10% ABV is a monster!"
""
""
""
"O: Well I have to say this is one of the best IIPA's I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. The mouthfeel and taste just dance together so well in this beast of an IPA. I love it...I want more..."
"I hesitated in purchasing a 6 pack due to the $18 price tag. Then one day was lucky enough to find in on tap at the Gahanna, OH Old Bag of Nails Pub. It exceeded my expectations. While not quite on the level of Pliny the Elder, as a hophead I found it very good. So much so that I shelled out the $18the very next day"
"O - Not as good as years past (this is 2012), but still a decent DIPA. A bit harsh this year, might mellow out better with some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A hop lovers dream. Was wondering if it was all hype. After drinking it I can see why it constantly ranks high on anybody's list. Very enjoyable. Wondering how it would age. Think I'll set 2 aside out of the six pack for to keep for awhile."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden copper with a caramel ice cream head. Prevalent grapefruit nose that alternates to a malty aroma as the head fades. There is little head retention. Some lacing on the glass. The beer involves the entire palate from the beginning. A nice, smooth, malty, grapefruit and pine on the front of the tongue, with a simultaneous pleasing floral scrubbing on the back. This jubilee fades into a pine finish that ultimately yields to a pleasant and surprising citrus perfume, which flavors the alcohol warmth that escapes into the nasal passage. Why isn't this the number one DIPA in the world??"

"The graphic on the front of the bottle is a good one. This is the hulk of the hops. Maybe a little much to be honest. However you are still advised to try it for yourself, particularly if you are a self-proclaimed hophead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: I could not detect any honey whatsoever."
""
"O- Going in to this review it was very hard not to be biased due to all of the positive hype that this beer receives, however it is one of the very few that I have tried that has actually almost exceeded it in terms of how much I truly enjoyed this beer. This is the perfect beer in so many ways and I am happy to say it is the first beer I have ever reviewed that I have given a 5. This is an absolute must try for hop lovers and anyone who loves beer in general."
"O - One of the best beers in one of my favorite styles. There was no doubt I was going to enjoy it, but I was afraid all the hype and exclusivity (in my area, at least) would build up my expectations too high. Hopslam didn't disappoint and should be considered world class in the DIPA category. It has the hops and alcohol that """slam""" the palate, yet a soft sweetness that mellows the flavors out. I was happy to get this one fresh and it will be a struggle not to down my whole six pack quickly."
""
""
"Weighing in at 10%, this is still a VERY drinkable beer. Perfect thing to warm up with on a Winter's day in Michigan!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth - the honey takes the edge off the hops. Effervescent, but with small bubbles - not overly carbonated. Really delicious double IPA - one of the best I've had. Expensive for a weekly beer, but is a really excellent treat. Interested to try cellaring a couple to see how they age."
""
"O: Nothing like it. Drinkable is an understatement. Flavors are in your face without being over the top. Nicely in check with hefty malts, sugary honey, piney hops and an exciting level of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a hop lovers dream. It gets you right away."
"guess I been hopslammed"
""
"O: I first had this beer two years ago… long before I had tried anything else like it. It has been my favorite beer since. I plan on aging the last two bottles, how long? As long as I can wait."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like it better on tap, but this is still a leader among IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"O: Look forward to this beer each year. Defiantely my kind of beer! Besides the price... this beer is PERFECT... even with the price... I am happy to pay it because this is truely worth it!"
"Overall - I can see why this beer is so hyped. I prefer pliny and heady but this is definitely top 5 DIPAs for me. SO GOOD"
"The body was nicely full and smooth, and was fairly well balanced across the tongue. Drinkability was very good, this is a rare ImpIPA I'd drink a few of at a time. Overall, one of the rare beers that actually lives up to it's hype. For me, this is a much better beer than the even more hyped PtE. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"I can only say AWESOME first time taste. Beautiful copper color yet cloudy. Not much head but what was there lingered a bit lacey. I bought a 6 pack and will cherish the other five, bottled on 02/09/2012, just wish it was a bit less expensive. I couldnt really smell the honey but did pick up a bit of sweetness on the taste after it lingered on the tongue. Cant wait to drink the rest."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Clean with a crisp finish. Perfectly balanced with a medium body. Has a great sweetness to it from the honey. Woth every bit of $21.99 a six pack. The hops come through a lot more when it warms up. AWESOME! CHEERS!"
"Hopslam is a great DIPA, especially considering the tremendous batch size, and I prefer it to *bottled* Pliny. Draft vs draft is another question entirely that can (hopefully) be settled sooner rather than later."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"O- A beer that has been on my beer bucket list. It lived up. Very good beer, maybe not in my top five or ten, but still way up there."
""
"O - A really solid DIPA, and I am really glad I was able to get my hands on this one. This beer holds up to it's name and the hype around it. At 10% abv, you better be careful!"
"Make no mistake, the first taste is a hop-heavy throat punch. But with its honey backbone, it only gets better on the second taste. Drink it with a pest meal if you want to compliment this outstanding beer appropriately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Batch number 10914. Bottled 1/26/12. Grapefruit, grass and pine dominate but it's the sweet backbone that sets this apart. It's beauty is that it can be so satisfying in bitterness but shows just the perfect amount of molasses/malty sweetness that it justs tastes amazing. Great making of 10% abv. How could you not look forward to its release every year. Earns its reputation each and every time."
""
""
"O) The alcohol could have been slightly less detectable, but considering the ABV, this is highly drinkable, which means I will proceed with caution since this is a work night. This is a must purchase every year, and without a doubt, highly recommended."
""
"O: Unbelievably drinkable, the Hopslam puts it out there and I accept unconditionally. World Class."
""
"Last half of the glass/bottle finds it hop heavy, the seesaw heavily weighed on the hoppy side. To compare to others in the genre, I prefer Pliny for it's balance and pine-ey ness; this is definitely not a West coast beer, it makes perfect sense its a Midwest beer since I find it tasting somewhere in between Pliny and Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic IPA. So glad I bought it even though the high price. Hops aren't over powering and the honey/citrus help balance it out."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange color with a one finger head which gives way to skim. A moderate amount of lace is present on the glass. The aroma is of piney and floral hops with the citrus hops coming over the top and dominating. The taste starts out with a piney and floral hop taste over a sweet malt backbone. The citrus hops come in and steal the show with a slight honey presence at the end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very solid dipa. The flavors are well blended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- While enjoying this one many times, I still don't find the honey it talks about except only in the background... I still would enjoy this over and over but would appreciate more pronounced honey if they put this on their bottles! Would STILL highly recommend this brew and will be buying multiple six-packs when able to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My favorite brew hands down."
""
""
""
"A great brew. Very balanced for how big it is. I think this was my first imperial ipa. I was 20 at U of M in Ann Arbor, drank it straight out of the the bottle. Had no idea what I was doing. Thanks to my buddy Drew for sending this out to me."
""
""
"Thanks to NDAK for the trade."
""
"Taste = Tangerine mixed with grapefruit,then dry as bone, followed by an alcohol warmth that follows it all the way down to the chest. Carbonation is just right, adds a little zing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasted side by side w/ Abrasive & Zombie Dust 2/12/2014"
""
""
""
"O: not a bad beer and I would definitely drink this again if readily available to me. Try this as fresh as possible as this has more explosive flavor and aromas"
"A good and unique DIPA, but doesn't live up to the hype for me. This beer is excess over finesse, and to it's credit it does that very well; but I would like more complexity and subtlety in a DIPA before I call it """world class"""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have officially been HopSlammed. I only wish it was more available - I now see why this beer has a religious cult type of following. Best DIPA I've had so far. Now if I could just find Pliney... 5"
""
"O: Definitely a top 5 DIPA and a pleasure to drink every Jan/Feb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. The hops are fresh and flavorful. This is one I'll get again."
"O- Truly a great DIPA. Honestly one of the best I have had. The drinkability for 10% is astounding and the balance of flavors is amazing too. Another great one from Bell's."
""
""
"O - All in all... very solid, I'm being picky and thats because I really really enjoyed it out of the cask more. For $20 bucks a 6 pack kinda disappointing compared to last year but still damn good. Depending on what your tastes are, you might enjoy this 5 times more out of a cast... it literally blew my mind. If I were giving a cask review it would receive about a 4.8"
"Ummm,smells like grapefruit at the peak of ripeness. Not a hint of bitterness. There is a sticky sweetness to the nose that may be the honey. Head is less than I remembered. Taste is of grapefruit with just the right amount of sugar on it. I'm not picking up on the pineapple like I remembered. Mouthfeel has far more carbonation than the weak head would indicate. I detect discrepancies from last years batch, but still a solid, solid beer that remains a contender for best of the best."
""
""
"It also has a perfect malt background and there is no taste of alcohol even with the high ABV. Amazing. It's especially phenomenal on tap."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into a Tulip on 2/15/2012. Bottled on 1/23/2012."
"O - I am shocked the hype on this was well deserved. I would say this tastes like a cross between Lupulin Maximus and Double Trouble. Very complex for the style as there are alot of flavors here for an IIPA and not your typical pineapple and grapefruit. Loving the lacing, aroma, and smooth mouth feel. This may be the best beer I have ever had."
"O: Overall a solid beer. Again, the flavor profile was a little lighter than I was expecting, but relative to the style, this beer is impeccable."
""
"On tap at Sava’s in Ann Arbor. Served in pint glass. Aroma has traces of both the sweet honey and the in-your-face pine citrus hops. Elements of grapefruit and a hint of cat pee (citra?). Clear amber color, with a small head. Looks like candy. Beautiful golden orange pour and perfectly clear. Big head and punches you with the aroma as it pours (have also had bottled). Taste follows the aroma perfectly. Grapefruit, pine, zesty citrus, and some sweet honey. Nice bitterness up front with a punch of hops going down as well. Lingering honey citrus pine on the palate. Very drinkable, despite the 10% alcohol. Light to medium body with medium carbonation. A must try for anyone who fancies themselves a hop head. I look for this one every winter. Wish it were year round. Out of the bottle this is excellent, but on draft this thing hits a whole new level. I find a bit more of the mellow honey sweetness on draft and more floral aromatics--but excellent both ways."
"Overall: The smell beats out the taste for me, but this is definitely among the smoothest, tastiest ones I have had. Glad to have finally gotten to try this beer and looking forward to my next one. If only I could get it easier out here."
""
"Overall: One of my favorite DIPA's. Happy I finally get to review it. Definitely my favorite IPA that I can easily get in Florida when it is released."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- good drinkability."
""
""
"O-this is possibly the bestb IPA i have had. absolutely delicious."
"Overall: I certainly appreciate trying this beer, but I can't say that I really fell in love with it like everyone else. It's a stellar DIPA and certainly worthy of it's hype, but I personally prefer a more fruity/citrusy hop profile on a DIPA. Regardless, I'd seek this out again...maybe offer up my whole cellar for a fresh bottle (enter sarcasm)"
"Overall: An incredible Double IPA and one of the best beers in the world. The bitter hops and sweet malts play off each other perfectly."
""
"O: hands down one of the best beers out there not only for the style but overall, its also one of my personal favorites and my favorite Bell’s beer (although I hear good things about Black Notes). Year in and year out one of the best beer available."
""
""
""
""
"O- 2012 on tap was fantastic on tap... in the bottle in 2012 not as good"
""
"This beer is straight up medium bodied. Carbonation is there but doesn't make a big deal of itself. It isn't sticky or syrupy, the flavors flow perfectly, it moves over the tongue well and it has the dry finish you expect from the style. It's sheer genius."
""
"Amber color that poured with an off-white head and nice lacing. Smells of peach and pink grapefruit with tastes of pink grapefruit and hints of clover honey. More enjoyable than the much touted Arrogant Bastard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Loved it, its a bit more in-your-face than Pliny but I like the more robust flavors. Good, clean hops flavors, decent bitterness, complimentary malt bill. Just all around great stuff."
"O: I love this beer. I look forward to getting a 6 pack every January. The hype lives up to the name of the beer and it is a great DIPA. My girlfriend stole the beer from me and I was forced to up one of my own."
"So glad this is coming out in bottles here this week."
""
""
"Overall - The perfect non-west coast DIPA. Since this beer is highly hyped and reasonably available there is plenty of skeptics. But this beer doesn't let down."
"O - Amazing, remarkable, only good things to say about this stuff. Bought a bottle that I'm saving for when I need another fix. Must-try for hop-heads and beer appreciators alike."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a slowly fading white head that leaves stripes of lacing all down the glass. Smell is absolutely jam packed with citrus hops, complemented by a floral aroma. The taste comes through with an absolute blast of hop flavor. Citrus and floral hops all over the place with a nice bit of pine coming through as well. The malts and honey come together to form a softly sweet backdrop for the hops to shine. It also lends to a silky, smooth mouthfeel with lighter carbonation. The tropical hop aspects linger longer than the bitterness with a sweet hop finish. I usually like my DIPAs dry as possible, but this beer, as far as I've found, is one of a kind in the way the soft sweet malt flavors blend seamlessly into the intense tropical, citrus hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable. First bottle I had I really enjoyed, this bottle I had right after a elder and that was a hard beer to follow."
""
"O: It's still a great beer but not as great as the bottle-conditioned version -- so much for the CO2 is the same forced as yeast-carbonated argument. The hop character is a lot more one-dimensional which misses the explosiveness of the tropical fruit qualities of the bottled brew. Not sure why though to be honest."
""
"Overall quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. Super fruity with the hints of lemon and orange but also had the bitterness I love (and a smooth bitterness at that). This is the only beer I've ever ordered twice on the same night."
""
"D/O: This is a fairly effective strong DIPA. Sweetness is pronounced early, backlighting and perhaps detracting slightly from the featured hop aromatics. Despite the sweetness it is not boozy, managing not too stray too far into the 'kitchen sink' trap that other extreme DIPAs often find themselves in. It is dissimilar to Russian River Pliny the Elder; try comparing it to Port Hop 15, Avery Maharaja, Oskar Blues Gubna, or even Alpine Exponential Hoppiness instead. In defense of this beer, it manages to exceed all but the latter."

"2012 Hopslam pours golden-amber, with one finger's worth of white foam that leaves a little lace. A symphony of piney and citrusy hop aromas blast the nasal passages as hints of pineapple, orange, and grapefruit blend beautifully. Sweet malt flavors intertwine with tropical fruit and honey tones, little to no alcohol warmth in the sweet and sticky finish. Medium-heavy body with medium amounts of carbonation make this brew dangerously easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Review edited on 2/14/12 had a full bottle to myself and it totally changed the look"
"o: excellent brew."
""
""
"a thick creamy three finger high head slowly recedes to a frothy off white cap, leaving massive amounts of thick clumpy lacing behind. a clear orange copper colored body just looks delicious. smell is very floral with citrus, honey and pine. caramel is also present. taste is near perfect. big citrus notes with a touch of honey and just the right amount of pine to keep it from being too sweet. along with the caramel there appears to be a little pepper on the back end. mouthfeel is a full creamy body that goes down easy. good carbonation and the right amount of spice from hops make this alive on the tongue. another punch of citrus hops before the long dry finish that leaves you wanting more. overall this is the beer that all others of the style try to be. many come close, but none achieve the well deserved hype of hopslam."
""
"O- Hopslam continues to be a favorite of mine, but the price and limited availability to me in CO makes it one I don't enjoy as much as I'd like"
""
"Overall:"
""
"Overall - I used to think this beer was the bee's knees of IPAs, but having had far more interesting hop profile IPAs, this one hasn't quite risen to its lofty heights as of late. Definitely not one of those """It was better last year""" people, but I feel my appreciation for it has changed."

"2014 update; Smoother, richer and MONSTER lacing in the glass!!! Upgraded to perfect scores! Sorry couldn't help it the is one friggen awesome beer!"
""
"O: I like this beer, but not as much as it is hyped. There are a lot of better DIPAs out there. I would go so far as to say Bell's makes a better DIPA: The Oracle."
"O: Freakin as good or better than I recall it two years ago!"
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty solid beer, though the noticeable alcohol was something of a turn-off for me."
"Cheers."

""
"I also had this on draft and it was pretty damn good too!"
""
"Overall this is a wonderful offering from Bells that I will definitely seek out again next year. A little steep on the price, but I expected such with all of the hype associated with this one. Well above average."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a very smooth, drinkable beer to be 10% ABV. I'm very impressed and can see what all of the hype is about. Would definitely love to get some more of this in the future!"
"O: absolutely great. I don't know if it was luck or design that makes this beer exponentially better as you drink it (up to 4 for me, 5 and 6 taste the same as number 4) but this beer is great the first time and even better the 2nd 3rd and 4th time."
""
"Taste is excessively earthy, quintessential hops, with some nice fruit tones and a lot of pine. Quite a bit of balance for a beer this bold, great overall drink. Medium body with an oily texture. Overall a great beer that definitely doesn't disappoint."
""
"O: Good stuff, not much to complain about here, maybe a touch more on taste would bring this beyond great, can't wait to get some in bottles to drink at home"
""
""
"One of the more bitter DIPA's I've had, but unlike some others that really drove up the IBU's, this one has a pretty nice sweetness underneath that helps temper it a bit and gives character. Very nice."
""
""
"Overall: This is overhyped this year, and wouldn't purchase more than one six pack."
"O - It's a whole lotta beer, and I try to pick it up at least once a year, considering there's only about a 2 month window to get it."
"O: Overall a well balanced dipa with a unique influence of honey balances this out for a remarkable, yet smoothing and respectable hop bitterness that is easy and very enjoyable to down. Had a wow moment when realizing this was 10%abv. Just a remarkably smooth and easy dipa especially at this level. The honey no doubt adds a higher OG and ABV% while still maintaining a good balance of sweetness and malt level with the hops. Nicely formatted by style."
"Overall, it didn't knock my socks off, but was definitely very good. I'm not a big IPA/DIPA guy, but I enjoy trying them, and this one mixed a good ratio of malt to hops. The underlying sweetness adds to the experience."
"Blech."
"EDIT2: Drank a 12/29 bottle on 2/26. TONS of pineapple. Like pineapple juice was dumped in it. Tasty, but too sweet and not enough hop."
"This is a really good IPA. The flavor is balanced well, the high ABV is masked well, and the hops aren't overpowering. If it weren't for the high ABV, I would several of these in a sitting."
"It really makes the herbalness stand out more in the nose and on the palate. The bitterness is also working a little differently. Instead of starting to overwhelm the palate and then backing off, it just sits on the roof of the mouth in the finish."
"O: Don't get me wrong this beer is Great. Doesn't live up to the hype it seems. My biggest Kudos to bells would be the balance of flavor and hiding the 10% without killing your mouth in bitterness. Flavor to me thought just tasted like a Sierra Nevada Torpedo extra IPA with more fruit and balanced with more Alcohol. Great beer but not worth trading for more."

"O: For a 10% double IPA, wow! Very drinkable and the ultimate hop fix; had this in the bottle a couple of years ago and it seemed much more harsh and hot back then; great stuff and I suppose worthy of the hype (I guess)."

"One of the best beers I’ve ever had! Had this on tap at Red’s Alehouse in North Liberty, IA. Copper color pour with white head and tons of lacing. Floral, citrus, pine, hop smell. Bitter start but a smooth hoppy almost creamy finish. Easy drinking beer and highly recommended!"

"Overall, this really didn't strike me as much better than many other East Coast DIPAs--way too sweet for my liking. I've heard complaints about this year's version, but I haven't had it in past years, so I can't compare. I will say that the bottles in the case I bought seem to vary in sweetness and hop character, to my tastes. All in all, I went out of my way to procure a case of this beer, and in the future I will not do so. I love a lot of Bell's beers--and Two Hearted is one of my favorite IPAs--but the hype for this one seems unwarranted to me."
"O - enjoyable, very enjoyable. But not in my top five."

"O: A great beer from a brewery I wish I had easier access to. I have recently heard that Bell's is planning to expand distribution to Texas, but I'm not holding my breath."

"O- A damn fine beer. It's certainly sweet and I'll admit I had a couple bottles that didn't do it for me, but at it's full potential this beer is really delicious. The hop flavor is unlike anything I've tasted previously. If it were available in my area I would certainly buy more soon."
"Still this is very enjoyable and highly recommended."

"It's not something I could drink a lot of in one night, but it's something I could drink one of every night. It's really superb."
"Overall, I tend to annoy easily when discussing whether a recipe has changed or so-and-so is less hoppy than last year. Looking back on a past on tap review, I loved this beer. Maybe it was time and place, a food pairing, a moment in time. I do know that at times I had been enamored with HopSlam and others, I've been, shall we say, underwhelmed. Right now, it's a pretty solid DIPA, but doesn't stand as a favorite in the style."
"Serving type: bottle"

"There is almost a rye taste underneath. It has a dark fruit, semi-grape note to it. It is quite bitter when it first hits your tongue and then washes out to the back smoothly. Floral throughout. Very, very, very nice beer."
""
""
"O- Worth the hype, definitely worth of the high ratings."
""
"O: The honey is the high point here. Otherwise, not particularly hoppy. Incredibly drinkable for 10%--I would have guessed 6 or 7 without looking at the label. Good, but I'm not sure I understand the craze over it."
"O: Yum. More subtleties in the hop flavors come out the more you drink. Sham I waited a little too long and only managed to score one. Still, a great beer for my first ever BA review."
""
"I received this one in a trade, drank fresh. This one didn't live up to the hype for me.It has an incredible smell, best part of the beer for me. Did taste good, but a little too boozy for me. I realize it is high abv, but alcohol not hidden well enough."
"Ok, so is it worth all the hype? I'd probably say so. It's a great beer, and I really am glad to have the opportunity to try one of the (presumably) """holy grails""" of the IPA world. This is a great beer, and it's a shame it isn't more widely available. Mark one off the bucket list."

"O - A nice delightful Imperial IPA."
"A fantastic DIPA, though I still believe it doesn't match up to California's finest from Russian River and Alpine."

"Dig my tongue-in-cheek semi-review here: http://youtu.be/h3AwB0KYj2w"
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow color. Small lacing around the glass. Smells of fresh floral aromas, no smells of any fruit. Upon the first sip, a strong hop flavor kicks in. This is a hell of an IPA. Very hoppy. A few seconds after the first sip, a pleasantly sweet honey flavor kicks in. A few sips in, the honey sweetness masks the hoppy bite and settles really nicely. Becomes sweet, and very smooth. This is a great beer."
""
"This beer is bitter!!! Holy cow most of my friends hate it but I love double IPA's. The hops start off strong with some mild citrus tones and then mellow out as the beer continues through the palate until the beer mellows out to a nice even experience. I bought two six packs of this because I know how rare it is and it did not disappoint. A perfect example of a double IPA and I can't wait for next years batch"
""
"Pours gold hinting at orange with a fluffy white head that quickly fades into a thin mesh. Big pine and grapefruit in the nose along with peach, pineapple, mango, and guava...a nice tropical fruitiness. You even catch the slightest bit of caramel. For me, pine was the most prominent taste. It had a strong presence in the front and was the taste that lingered longest. In between there's a nice helping of citrus,pineapple and more malt presence than I was expecting. I typically like a DIPA with a more resiny feel, but I really enjoyed the crisp and clean feel this had. The drinkability is almost stupid. I'd never guess this to be anywhere close to a 10%ABV. The first time I had this I wasn't overly impressed, but after further review, this is a winner."
""
"Pours beautifully with a nice very light colored head. Beautiful light orange color that accentuates the citrus and tropical fruit scent emanating from the glass. Orange, mango, grapefruit, pine...it's all there in the scent. The taste is HUGE and follows the scent. The mouth feel is very good though not as viscous as I had imagined it would be. This is a BRUISER in every sense of the word. Excellent. No wonder it get such rave reviews. Glad I stood in line and I am thankful for my 4 bottle allocation. I didn't think it possible that I would find an IPA that beat 2 Hearted for my taste. I just did. Outstanding effort by Bell."
""

""

"O - Well, I finally got to try the infamous Hopslam that I made sure to get this year. There's no doubt that this is the best DIPA I have ever had up to this point. Even so, I think my expectations might have risen too high with the reputation that this beer has. Putting that aside though, I can really appreciate what an awesome offering this is. The hoppy aromas and flavors are very well done, as expected, but what sets this beer apart from others is its drinkability. I'm not sure there's another 10% ABV beer that's as easy to drink as this one. Thankfully, I've got a few more of these to consume, so the good times aren't over just yet."
"Around $18 for a six pack"
""
"O- I didn't realize the hype that came along with this beer, and I only wanted to try it cause I enjoyed Two Hearted...it is really good, though I think I preferred Pliny and obviously Heady. I wish this was brewed more often cause it really is an enjoyable beer...if you have a chance to get some I highly recommend giving it a try"
"O - Really a solid beer. I don't know why it costs THAT much, but it's a pleasure to drink. It really hits tha balance that so many doubles and even standard IPAs miss."
""
""
""
"O- This beer gets a ton of hype and deservedly so. I've had yet to try Russian River's Pliny the Elder, but if its better than this it would have to be an out of body experience. Between this, the Two Hearted Ale, Best Brown, and Special Double Cream Stout...Bell's makes some killer beers and this one is the headliner. Shame that this is not a year-round serving. Im glad that I have another case of this waiting for me upon its arrival."

"Overall: It's mighty tasty, but I can't buy in to the hype completely. Lots of tastiness to be had and highly drinkable for the ABV and the all out hop assault. Nice malt profile helps liven things up. Incredibly well-crafted and worth drinking if you can get it. Don't sell your arm though."

"O: Delicious, highly drinkable DIPA, the 10% ABV is incorporated incredibly well. The malt level is great, not a malt bomb like so many DIPAs brewed around me, and not super dry and void of body like many others, well done. One of the few DIPAs that I will seek out year after year."
""

"thanks again to jyoungsbcp"
"This was a good one to add to the list of tried. Definitely a must for anyone wanting to explore IPAs and DIPAs. Very overwhelming flavor and I would not recommend to the faint of heart or stomach. This is a very strong beer and one to be aware of such beforehand. Nonetheless a worthy beer and one for any real connoisseur to try. Good luck!"
"O: Great tasting beer, my only criticism is the alcohol presence which I thought was a bit too much given the ratings."

"HopHeads who love this beer and appreciate the citrus flavor rightly make this their beer of choice, my brew taste just runs towards ambers & stouts."

"I've been disapointed before by hyped beers, not this time. I'm fortunate to have tried this."
""

"I've had plenty of IPAs similar to this one, so I wouldn't really say it's a trade item, or worth going out of the way for, as some people make it out to be, but it's definitely nice to have when it's around."
""
""
"Overall this is a top notch DIPA. One of the best. Very drinkable for the abv. Very smooth with an excellent hop profile and balance. Worth seeking out if it's available. Tastes amazing on draft!"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with an off-white head that fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grapefruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, and some sweet honey. Taste is of grapefruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, honey, alcohol, and malt. There is a sweet candy flavor on the aftertaste with a mid bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is an extremely good DIPA that lives up to the hype surrounding it."

"O-A solid beer-I can understand the hype. Not a a favorite style of mine but enjoyed this one. Well done."

"Overall, for my first experience with HopSlam, I was quite pleased. The high ABV seeks up on you and is no where detectable, which makes it quite dangerous. I do have to say that I am slightly dissapointed overall. While this is a super beer, it is by no means my favorite DIPA, mainly because of its potency and lingering bitterness despite the ample sweet honey flavors. Definitely a great beer but I will take Heady Topper over this everyday of the week."

"Overall: Nice Double IPA. Not worth the hype, but that is no fault of the beer itself."
"Still on the pliny train."
"Overall, there isn't anything bad I can say about this beer. The entire experience draws me back to the picture on the bottle, a man being crushed by a giant hop cone. This is what drinking Hopslam feels like. Excellent job Bell's, in creating an IPA that needs to be sipped to be appreciated."
"Overall, it's outstanding. It's really good. Cheers!"
"by far the best beer i have had in awhile. i debated picking up a six pack for myself however with it being so limited i let our customers have at it :) luckily we have the best customers ever and one was kind enough to hand a bottle over as i was instructed to enjoy and soooo i did. not bitter at all definitely something to sip on and enjoy to the very end"
""
""
"Well, this is easily one of the best DIPAs I've had. It is so different in some ways from Pliny that it is hard to draw a comparison. Bready, malty, complex hop character (fruity, dank, earthy), and just well balanced overall. I'm glad I got to try it fresh."
""
""
"O: A good solid DIPA, but nothing to write home about. I'm from Michigan, so I was ready to have my socks knocked off. I can only conclude that anyone rating this above the best west-coast IPAs, Heady Topper, etc., have never had any of those fresh. This just isn't terribly special. Disappointing."
"Overall its good, but not necessarily better than many other less hyped beers."
""
"Beer pours a lovely translucent golden straw haze with roughly a fingers width head atop it. The head recedes quickly, and lacing is thin and minimal. The smell is outstanding. Loads of hops and loads of citrus. Just the way I want my IPA's to smell. The taste is on part with the nose. Fabulous. Again, more hops, and even MORE citrus. This is a well balanced beer in my opinion. The finish is sweet and slightly hot, but this is far from a booze bomb, in my opinion. It'll warm the back of your throat and stomach though, no doubt. Overall, this is very solid. I thoroughly enjoyed this."

"overall great beer definitely recommend and will seek this out every year it hits the shelves after having this one yummm"
"Pours with a nice white foam that dissipates to a ring that slowly laces the glass. Clear amber/orange color. The smell is an great combination of fruit and hops. Taste is all hops. Sort of a citrus, orange peel hop flavor. The 10% alcohol is well hidden. Mouth feel is medium with good carbonation. Overall a great beer."
"O - Hopslam is one of the best DIPAs out there and well worth the hype/price. I wish this wasn't quite the rarity that it is, but perhaps that is some of the charm. A must-have if you have any interest in DIPAs."
"O- Very satisfied I got my hands on this. Yes it is hyped, but thats part of the fun. If I can imagine this beer as a godsend, and thus improves my entire experience, why the hell not? Its a great beer and should be sought out. Cheers to Bells for this golden elixir, and cheers to all BAs."
""
"Pours a beautiful gold color with a nice one finger off white head. Really good lacing on the side of my snifter. Somewhat clear in appearance, and nice amount of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. The nose is amazing: pineapple, mango, orange, peach- very citrus oriented, and extremely well balanced. The taste even steps it up a notch. One drink and my palate screams for mercy.. thus the name 'Hopslam'. I get the citrus flavors, honey, slight malt in the background, and some other grassy/earthy hops. Amazingly, none of the 10% alcohol is evident at all. Just really well balanced and ultimately tasty. The mouthfeel is exquisite as well. It has the citrus/honey sweetness with some malt, and then the hops just wrecking your palate on the backside. Perfectly carbonated and executed. Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite seasonal beers- and favorite beers period. It's amazing, and I'm glad I still have five left in my fridge. Cheers!"

"Verdict: This is a slam dunk from Bell’s, and with a year round beer like Two Hearted, it comes as no surprise. Big bitter hops with a nice sweetness that makes this one go down dangerously fast for 10% ABV."
""
""
""
"There might not be much to say about this that already hasn't been said, but why not try. Pours quite nicely, beauty orange/copper color with a soapy 2 finger head that leaves minimal lacing. Smells of pine and just a hint of honey. Solid taste and the honey counterbalances the hoppiness quite well. Great mouthfeel with a nice aftertaste that lingers forever. I am damn impressed. Hope to have a DIPA battle between this, Pliny the Elder, and Surly Abrasive. Its gonna be epic."
"O: Well it is one of the best looking and smelling IPAs around. But the taste is overly sweet and the mouthfeel overly sticky. I know it's an Imperial IPA, but I'd rather they let those hops shine than covering them up with honey. Reminds me of drinking soda fountain extract...too over the top. A unique beer and certainly tasty, but I wouldn't and don't feel the need to revisit this one over and over. I bought one bottle and I feel like that will be enough this year."
"Overall, one of the best DIPA I've had the opportunity to sample. The amazing malt and honey to hop balance is second to none. An amazing citrusy and hoppy IPA. It lives up to the hype."
"o- highly enjoyable beer, and i would definitely buy again. i'm really excited that i got the chance to try it."
""
"Carbonation is moderate, which helps keep the fairly hefty, oily body in check. There's nothing I can criticize about this beer without absolutely nitpicking. Hopslam is amazing beer. I think a word that sums it up perfectly is """focused.""" One of Larry Bell's finest offerings and a landmark double IPA."
"Well, honestly this beer is simply awesome. There's plenty of citrus and fruit character, backed by a great amount of sweet honey and malt. It's big, bitter, citrusy and sticky - perfect for an Imperial IPA."

"o - superbly crafted an imo one of the few beers that is deserving of its lofty reputation. dangerously drinkable though, you'll finish the bottle well before the 10% kicks in, so be careful. every beer lover should seek this out."
"O: This is truly a unique and flavorful beer, though not what I expected considering all the hype. I was surprised by the sweetness, yet disappointed with the lack of bitterness of this brew; not what I expected from a DIPA called """Hopslam""". Perhaps Bell's intention was to create the most well-balanced DIPA ever... which I believe they did. Either way, this beer is dangerously smooth and drinks way to easy for a brew with 10% ABV. However, if I wanted a DIPA, this probably wouldn't be the first beer that comes to mind."
"The feel isn't cloying, but it is thick. The abv is hidden incredibly well, but I can catch the quick burn at the end. All around a wonderful midwest DIPA; more floral than bitter, and I'm glad to have it in such abundance."
""
""

"Overall: This is apparently high in ABV (I can tell after I've finished) and is definitely high in hops, yet with a lighter body and a solid malt backbone, Hopslam is a very drinkable beer. Definitely up there with the best IPAs out there, especially those from these parts of the country. 4.5"
"Okay this brew is awesome. The hops are there in the front, middle and end. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming at all. Such a smooth brew. I truly wish this beer was a year round brew. One if not the best DIPA's out there. This brew is worth tracking down and enjoying."

"A great dipa and beer in general. Deserves to be where it is in the ratings. Really enjoy the balance of this beer. A lot of the top rated ipas I end up thinking are too hop forward with not enough malt to balance, but this is good. Good stuff."

"Medium to full bodied with tingly carbonation, this beer is way too drinkable for 10% ABV. The body is a little sticky and very coating but surprisingly smooth and enjoyable. The carbonation is a rather fizzy but it definitely needs to be to make this beer as refreshing and enjoyable as it is."

"This is one of my favorite beers. The hops smell great and deliver bold flavors. The malts create a subtle aftertaste making this one very balanced beer."
""
"Enjoyed this one 11 days after the bottling date. Appearance is a nice golden honey color with a large off-white head. The smell is absolutely the best I've experienced to date - a cacophony of citrus scents that is intoxicating. This is where this beer really stands out. Even my wife, who hates the smell of any beer, said """That's the least-offensive smelling beer I've ever smelled", which is quite an endorsement for her. The taste is not quite as powerfully citrus as the scent would lead you to think, but grapefruity bitterness comes through big time. There is enough of a malty and honey sweetness to provide some semblance of balance. Very nice mouthfeel adds to the experience. Outstanding."
""
""
""
"O - This beer came with a lot of hype and it lived up to expectations. This is a phenomenal DIPA."
""
"The taste and mouthfeel this year was better than last year's. Lot's of high gravity alcohol and full of hops....duh. Tangy and very appealing to my pallette."
"O: Not quite how I remembered it. This beer has a soft, but firm bitterness with massive notes of grapefruit and tropical fruits in both the aroma and taste. The 10% is nonexistant in the taste, but watch out! This is is one sneaky beer. Warming hits you you about a third of the way through. Definitely in my top 5 IPAs."
""
""
""
"O- Well worth the circus. I feel there is a little hype involved but the beer is amazing. I must say the bottle did this seasonal monster justice, the draft left me concerned. Will continue to seek out and enjoy for years to come."
""
""
"Hopslam this year is one of the most refreshing beers I've ever tasted. The drinkability is almost scary. It tastes like a fresh mix of citrus juice that I could personally drink all day until I succumb to alcohol poisoning. And personally I was not a big fan of Bell's at all before I tried Hopslam. Already had it on draft and out of the bottle, and out of the bottle there is much more of a citrus taste, and I can not taste any alcohol in it at all. It has a gorgeous golden blonde color with a thin white head that disappears quickly. There is a ton of citrus smell to this, the smell of hops and citrus almost fill the room when you open this beer. It is simply delicious."
""
""
""
""
"I feel funny drinking this beer in 7 degree weather... the fruitiness makes it feel like a cool summer-night beer. The complexity is in the nose- there is a beautiful palette of orange fruit, citrus, and flowers that is quickly overpowered by the hop bitterness and citrus/booze acidity that moves up your nostrils about one second after the sip... this is a beast, a beautiful, golden beast of a beer. The fruit and honey come back in the lingering aftertaste- only to be shot to the back with every next sip of wild IBU and citrus power. This WILL be a perfect summer night beer- I'm setting some aside until then or 2013, hoping it will mellow out a bit. A trippy tropical hop voyage."
"Thank you, Bells for this seasonal brew. I look forward to it year round."

"This beer is hoppy but well balanced, great example of style"
"O) Up there among the best examples of the style I ever had. Had an old bottle last year and saw potential for greatness, and I'm so happy I was able to get a fresh six-pack to confirm that. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A really good beer, but nowhere near the best DIPA available."
""
"O- No wonder this is one of the top IIPAs. At 10% it is really easy drinking and super well balanced. Up there with Abrasive as one of my favorite IIPAs."
"overall, this is just an amazingly well balanced beer. you can easily polish off 3-4 of these within an hour due to the lighter/medium body and because the ABV is non-existent (even at 10%)"
"O: My new favorite DIPA? Very possibly. Luckily I’ve got several more fresh one’s to drink to help me figure that out."
"O - Still a fantastic, bold, monster of a double IPA. At this point the """hype""" can only hurt this beer, as everyone who tries it for the first time must be expecting a life-changing experience. With so much great beer on shelves these days and my tastes shifted more towards RIS, I'm hesitant to go crazy trying to buy some since south FL quantities are minimal and expensive. I'd probably buy it just to trade, but everyone who loves beer needs to try this at least once."
""
"O- A very interesting DIPA that seems to be bigger than every DIPA in bitterness and alcohol on the taste/mouthfeel. The aftertaste after drinking this beer is amazing even better than drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not really all that impressed. The nose is too muted by the malt, the taste has too much booze to it, and the mouthfeel is too harsh. You won't find me buying a ticket for the hype train for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I am enjoying this so much, a hop lovers dream. So perfectly balanced and still very complex. So many wonderful hop flavors - citrus, pine, floral, meadowy, grassy, like you dipped the tips of a fistful of hops into some fresh honey from the comb, and thrust this into your mouth all at once. My favorite style is a really good DIPA, and until i find something better, this is a poker hand of 5 aces."
"Overall, this is an exciting beer. It is a lot of fun to drink, and has a well-balanced flavor despite its experimentation."
"O: This beer was worth the wait; one of my favorite beers from my favorite style to date. Now I know why people buy this by the case, even at $16+ a sixer. This beer is nothing short of wonderful, providing me with an experience that I wish every DIPA could duplicate – way to go Bell’s. I should have expected this from the guys who brought us Two-Hearted, but this one really blew me away."
""
""
"This beer is everything it's cracked up to be. Is it the best IIPA on the planet? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. What I can tell you is that it is one of the best IIPAs on the planet. I'm very grateful that I live in an area that has access to this beer every January. It is an absolute treasure."
""
"O- I wish this was available year-round! I try to drown myself in other brews during the interim each year, just to try to forget how much I miss this beer. For now, I will enjoy it as often as possible."
""
""
"Even now I feel like I've underrated it. Each one I drink seems to increase my appreciation. Top 10 for me, easily."
""
"Far too easy to drink @ 10%ABV"
""
""
""
"O- Overall I love this beer, I am glad that I got a hold of a couple 6 packs when I could because it is going fast! And for good reason, the hype is no lie; this beer is excellent! The 10% abv is very hidden.. and waiting like a ninja to drop down and slam you into a drunken stupor so beware!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not disappointed that I went for the full case. Really a delicious beer. I gotta say I have IIPAs higher on my list but it's damn good."
""
""
"This beer really lives up to the """hype""". It really is so different from a west coast dipa, such as pliny, and in my opinion could not even be compared to those types of beer. The perfect midwestern IPA."
"I love Hopslam season. I love the uniqueness of using honey to ramp the ABV. It ends up retaining it's hop bomb status without getting too sweet as most DIPA's do in this range. Love it."
"O- I had a buzz two days before I drank it, now I feel the golden glow of the gods and the sweet slowing down of time a 1/4 way through. Straight to the dome, cheers."
""
""
"Tastes like a strong IPA. Not much else to say here - the hops are strong with this one, and it has a heat factor that becomes less present the more I drink. But it's a strong IPA done so gloriously right. Really my only issue with the beer - I feel like I'm getting drunk too quickly. Getting drunk too quickly is not an issue, but feeling like it is. I could use a little bit less alcohol taste. Or maybe I just have fond memories of this beer when I had lesser taste buds? Whatever. Carbonation is well done. Overall a fantastic beer that I will get more of before the month is through and I'll look forward to spending nearly $20 on a six pack next year too. Thanks, Bells, for making a top notch beer that can be obtained in ways other than by waiting in line at the brewery or threatening to kill the family of a bottle shop owner."
""
"O: I love this beer, hard to find, but well worth the search. One of my top 10 beers for sure"
"O: Very well balanced and the honey sweetness really adds a nice touch that rounds out the beer. It's a shame this comes out in the winter as I would love to drink this during the warmer months, but it certainly is a treat none the less."
"O- This nearly defines what an American DIPA should be. It's a hophead's delight and is absolutely delicious. Definitely amongst my favorite DIPAs."
""
""
""
"O- definitely a top flight beer and it deserves it's kudos as one of the Best beers in the land. Everyone should try this beer. It's nothing complex or mercurial, every bottle is the same... DELICIOUS! Double Trouble from Founders is somewhat similar but WAY more hoppy and in your face grapefruit. You could definitely drink more than one of these in a session. One of my top 10 beers so far in my journey!"
""
"I might be too critical after seeing it's rating. I think this beer has an intense following."
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey color into a standard pint glass. Virtually no head to speak of. Smells similar to heaven- with mango and grass. That's the smell that comes to my mind on a Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock. Modestly rich and completed by a simple bitterness. I believe it is worth the praise it gets. Have been waiting for this for a year. Bought it at the Binny's in Bloomingdale. Is there a """5"" out there? Can't say for sure. As someone used to say, """If God made anythig better than this, He kept it for himself."""DL"
"O - I know it's a hugely hyped beer, but I think it lives up to it. I've yet to have a DIPA I like better."
""
""
"Had this beer about a week after it was bottled. This is a beutiful amber colored beer. Single finger of bright white head, The taste was full of hops upfront and a nice honey dipped grapefruit after taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and medium carbonated. If your a avid beer lover you have to try it, and if you call yourself a hop head, its a must have every year."
""
"Overall, its a fair DIPA, but definitely not worthy of the hype."
"O- Took the top spot as my #1 DIPA last year and still holds it down. This is just a bruiser of a beer that lets you know it's a DIPA."
"Truly an awesome beer. If you have yet to try Hopslam it is a must have."
"This is what I'd more expect from a hopslam. I had an """aged""" one from tap a few months back and it was very boozy. this one is very fresh (12/29/11) and tastes like i would expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit (2/19/14): After trying this again, as my experiences have heightened I have found that this beer is not as much as I initially made it out to be. Still delish, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One thing I love about PtE and HT is that I feel like I could keep drinking them all night; I never tire of their awesome hoppiness. As excited as I was to try Hopslam, especially on tap and so fresh, after one beer I had had enough and wanted to try a cleaner, hoppier IPA."
""
"I would have given it a five in appearance yet I have seen a couple better DIPA that had a little more texture and haze to them that I liked and met the style better....but just by a tad. Mouthfeel and overall scores could have been 5 had it not been for the alcohol burn that is taken away mainly by the malt and honey, but never quite gives up....near perfection!"
""
"Overall Im impressed this is my first time having hopslam and its very good, picked up two six packs at 19.25 each"
"Trade or travel, get some."
"A different kidg produced a better flavor. This one tasted the same, except add a ton of juicy citrus fruits."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- What a quality beer. Bell's is famous for making highly drinkable beers, but this one is on a different level. I can see why stores sell out of this in a day or two. A MUST try."
"Overall--The most magnificent thing on earth only better"
"O: One of the better DIPA's I had. Lives up to the hype. At my local store, nearly everyone was purchasing this today. I can see why. Glad I had the chance to try it."
""
"O: A really top notch beer. One of the best beers of it's class. Extremely well balanced. A really delicious beer."
""
""
"O - glad I have the opportunity to get this beer. It's hyped up for a reason. Get this is you have a chance. Best DIPA iv'e ever had, over dreadnaught and white rajah."
""
"O: To quote the Kool-Aid guy, """Oh yeah!""". This beer has got some major hop action going for it. Fantastically balanced, huge hop presence. A classic and one of the best offerings from Bells."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This review doesn't evaluate the properties of the beer or necessarily entice anyone into trying it, but if you're one of those people intent on trying a fantastic DIPA and money is generally not an issue, give this one a try. I recommend it."
"The only thing better is having it on firkin. But that is another story for another day."
"Cost: $17.99 for a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Outstanding. It's downright scary that this DIPA is 10% because it could easily be a session beer. I could drink these until I pass out, which by the 10% ABV wouldnt be very long. I'm glad there is plenty to go around this time of year. Good work Bells!"
""
"Edit: Well that was very difficult to read. Now that I actually know what I'm talking about, ignore the previous review lol. Very sweet DIPA. Crazy hoppy. Not very bitter. Just a big overflow of hops, but in a good way. Awesome mouthfeel. Very full bodied and creamy. I've noticed it tends to be a bit boozier on tap than it is in the bottle, but it is still good both ways. Totally worth the price. Can't drink a whole bunch of it at one time due to how sweet it is, but 2 or 3 is all you need at a time anyway. Drink it as fresh as possble, and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"One of the best DIPAs. Very drinkable, high alc. content. but not noticeable. Strong hop presence but surprisingly smooth."
""
"MF: Creamy and smooth, medium bodies, and INSANELY drinkable. This is seriously slammable/sessionable. No problem taking down multiple bottles if you want. A must find for anyone who can locate it."
"Hopslam is certainly not a misnomer. This is an exceptional DIPA that arrests and challenges your palate. I can't think of another beer that benefits this much from the addition of honey. Though the hops are explosive, the honey adds subtly and enough sweetness to bring out the best in all six hop varieties. Another beautifully crafted gem by Bell's."
""
""
"Enjoy!"
"O- Very good dipa. One of the best dipa's out there. Love the sweetness the beer gets from the honey and the balance of the bitter citrus hops."
"Hopslam...hype worthy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Im a huge fan of this beer and I find some the first day it's available in stores around SE Michigan each year. For 2014, that was Friday 1/10. This year's batch is disappointing. You know how the citrus and pine fall off as Hopslam ages? Well this batch (on day 1) tastes like a typical June Hopslam. Its still a great beer, and I will continue to enjoy it while it's out but Im not feeling like I need to hoard it as in the past. No problem, more for everyone else!"

"O- A Classic Double IPA that eveyone should try."
""
""
"O - There's a reason this has such a high rating. It's not in your face like some, it's not the most fragrant, but the balance, softness, mouthfeel and fabulous flavor put it way up there in my ratings."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was never much of an IPA fan, but then I walked into Dutch's. I have always been a fan of Bell's, and wow, I was Blown Away by this beer. The flavor was amazing the subtle hints of honey just made me instantly fall in love with it. It is my favorite beer. Bravo Bells!"

"appearance is a dark amber orange with a small head (when poured right). Has a nice citrus smell well as a good sharp hop taste, but not too strong. It might have a little higher carbonation but of course this comes along with higher alcohol content. But who cares about smell and appearance, this is one damn good beer and may accidentally get you drunk, FAST."

"As amazing as I remembered. Same smell, mouthfeel and taste but this time though I am getting a lot more of the maltiness, which cinches it for me. Not sure if thats the freshness of this bottle (the previous review was of a bottle 6 months old). Hoppy Days Are Here Again!! Hoppy Hopslam Day!!! Thanks Bells for the beer and thanks to Binnys Downers Grove for helping me get some today!"

"So good. Hats off to Bell's."
"Unicorn tears!!!! God juice... Smell is outstanding on this one. Taste is a floral boquet of the finest melody of hops. Mouthfeel is orgazmic. Overall this feels soo good it hurts. I fell in love with this brew... Too bad its only around for such a short time. Can't get enough of this gem."
"Pours amber orange gold with a mega foam white head. Leaves behind gobs of lacing. Nose is hops, citrus fruits, maybe some honey. Mouth is light to moderate, crisp and snappy. Not nearly as hoppy as expected. This isn't a hop bomb beer, but just a really great tasting hoppy beer. So maybe the name is a little misleading? Or maybe it just means it has hops in it and you will want to slam them down one after another? Regardless, good carbonation trending to the high side. Hops are more of a subtle bitterness that linger. Taste is floral hops, citrus fruits/lemon and some honey. Not nearly as much honey as I feared though. I normally don't like 'honey beers' but this is a huge exception thanks to the subtle usage. At 10% abv I can honestly say this is the most dangerous beer I know of. I could literally drink these one after another they are so smooth. Not a noticeable alcohol taste at all. But after a few, you can feel it and you know the bottle label was telling the truth. In the very small group that I consider perfect beers. My only real complaints are it is tough to get and wicked expensive."
"This is an extremely powerful and potent beer that is also highly enjoyable. One of the craziest beers I've ever experienced. Great hop taste and balance. High alcohol content isn't extremely noticeable while drinking. It's unique and highly flavorful. Definitely recommend it."
"O- Big thanks to Mikennat for this chart topper! I will definitely be pursuing this when it comes out fresh in the spring"
"lacked individuality...was hoping it would make a bigger impact...that said, would be happy to give it another chance."
"Overall – I know my bottle isn't the freshest, but I still thought this was an incredible beer. Either it really held up well, or the fresh stuff is going to blow my mind. Definitely one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"One of my all time favorite beers and my favorite DIPA."
"Very smooth for what it is. Tastes like they found a way to utilize all of the flavor from the hops without the harsh bitterness. This is one to be appreciated. You can sense after one sip that one of these will give you a nice buzz."
"Maybe this is a sort of aged bottle, but it's still quite good, but not that wow, holy shit, head shaking way I was stupidly awaiting. Oh well. All that aside, a good DIPA, especially given the big, basically undetectable ABV."
"This is a good beer that reminds me of the quality associated with the other Bell's beers that I've had. Its got some strong bitterness and alcohol, but is lacking of almost all aromatic hoppiness. The strength of the alcohol also makes this one hard to drink more than a few of. Worth trying, but not if you have to acquire long distance."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Needs to be enjoyed fresh. Thought this year was a little heavier on the mouth feel."
"O - Fantastic brew, look forward to it every year !"
"Cheers"
"O - Great Beer! I LOVE hops. Very well done Bell's"
"Overall: This beer lives up to the hype, looks the hype in the eye, and knocks the hype out of the park. A must have."
"Glasswear: Snifter"
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. A creamy texture which coats the tongue lightly and rests for the most part between the tongue and roof of the mouth. The finish is grapefruit astringency and hop flavor, mingled with a mild sweetnesss that persists for a few minutes and then fades quietly. Prominent warming that continues as a pricklyness on the lips. This beer slams you, and not you it. Clearly a winner to be enjoyed in small quantities."
"O - Pretty good. Not my favorite style but I dig it."
"Easily in my hall of fame. Incredibly drinkable beer for how big it is. It'll warm you up in cold Midwest nights but it's going down wonderfully on a hot August evening. Perhaps my favorite beer"
"Picked this up from World Market at Coconut Point Mall for $14.99/ 6 pack. Great price! Just looking forward to having it fresh. If it is this good 5-6 months past its prime, I cannot even begin to fathom the fresh version! Cannot wait for January to roll around & the fresh batch to hit shelves."
"Narrative: Sure, it wasn’t the WWE, but the triple title, welter weight tristate professional wrestling competition was nothing to sneeze at. The competitions behind the Tastee Freeze lacked the ambiance of a pure demonstrative environment for the masses, but the hum of the generator provided a mild lull for the public lacking dental insurance. A dim spotlight, spotlight loosely being referred to as a Belkin floodlight, shined furiously on the center of the canvas ring. A 9 year old girl swayed gently on the ropes awaiting the entrances. The smell of cut grass and grapefruit began to fill the baleful air, the mist of sticky herbal sweetness lingering within each patrons’ nose: Hopundertakehopper had arrived. He burst through the back bus room door and performed his classic flying maneuver, whose name needs no recitation at this juncture."
"Overall: Along with PtE, this is my favorite hop-bomb of all. I would like to see HopSlam become a fully available all-year beer."
"One of my favorite, if not my favorite, beers of all time. (2008) Oh man... there is a market out there for silly hop-infested beers for the wacky hopheads out there, but when something like this is so perfectly and deliciously balanced, it deserves supreme credit! (2009) Got some of this years batch... simply AMAZING. Huge grapefruit and fresh hop aromas and flavors. Man, this stuff is great."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will have it again if I get the opportunity I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good IPA now and then."
"Overall? Worth the hype."
"And oh yeah. Hoppiest. Beer. Ever."
"Overall: For me superior to for example Pliny, at least here the brewers were thinking about drinkability! Great brew"
"One of the smoothest mouthfeel IPAs I've had. very drinkable. Lives up to its overal BA rating"
"Overall: Not in my top 10 choices for a DIPA, I would like to see more malt to balance this out as everyone has said the honey does wonders but I didn't see it in this serving. I had a six of this and didn't really enjoy them, not worth the search IMO."
"D: Could drink this all year round. Hands down the best IPA i have tried to date! Once again Bell's you have lived up to expectations!"
"Overall amazing - wish it wasnt so hard to get here in South Fl. - A rating - only cause i wanna leave room for a perfect score. A DEF MUST HAVE! for Hop-Heads"
"O- an excellent beer that I wish was available to me on a regular basis. Extremely drinkable for 10% abv."
"O: The hops definitely stand out but it was not the 'punch in the mouth' that I expected, the hoppy bitterness is contrasted nicely by the sweet smoothness of the honey and malt, actually a little too sweet for a DIPA. This is a good beer but I don't think it lives up to all the hype. I really don't think the name accurately characterizes the beer."
"This moderately carbonated, spicy/hoppy IPA is a favorite among many. Though I feel the taste is exceptional, the aroma is one of the strongest aspects of this brew. The aroma and taste are near perfectly paired. It pours with a one to two finger head and finishes with a sharp feel which tapers rapidly. This one I keep stocked for as long as I can't find it available."
"O - A very good beer. Look forwards to getting my hands on some more Hopslam and other Bell's products."
"Update: The 2012 batch seems to have more booze, more honey, and more grassiness. I would like to hope that this is not simply a matter of my changing taste buds. In the event that I am, in fact, going crazy, I am not changing my 2011 ratings."
"O - Bell's continues to keep making great beers, and this is no different. Everything a DIPA should be, and no alcohol taste! Good, good DIPA!"
"Dark orange gold color that is mildly opaque. Awesome massive hop aroma with sweet sugary citrus and pine. The taste is of citrus and light sweetness that is very very drinkable for the ABV. There is no real alcohol taste due to the honey sweetness that helps cut the bitterness as well. This one delivered on every level of expectation and then some."
"Overall an amazing beer. Too bad it only comes around once a year. I saw a couple of bottles at my beer store recently but I dont know if I could drink it so old after elevating my standard for the beer so highly. It just wouldn't stand up to how it tastes fresh. might give it a try if i can't wait till next january."
"If you like/love Double IPA's, this is a must try! Extremely easy to drink for being a 10% ABV. Even if you like IPA's and not Doubles, this is very drinkable. No bitterness at all so if you like bitter DIPA's, then this might not be for you but you should still give it a shot anyway. Ridiculous beer!!!"
"O: This is very nice a hundred and three times better fresh but not bad with a few months on it. Looking forward to next years release already."
"Overall - Very, very good beer. Love the citrus notes in the beer. A lot of care went into brewing this. Probably the top 2 of all of the beers I have had."
"Basically I put this third in dipa rankings behind 90 min and PtE, and yes I prefer 90 overall, I seem to be in the minority in that battle, but that conversation is for another time."
"o- like drinking a liquid hop. the bitterness isn't overwhelming, it is just so good, you can't hardly believe it. the best IIPA i've ever had by a good margin. Can't wait till it is out again next year."
"O - This is a fabulous DIPA and one I will certainly buy again (being from MI, I have a strange sense of pride in what Bell's produces)."
"Pours a dirty orange color with a big white head that left behind some lace. Smells of huge hops and a lot of sugary malts. Mostly there is citrus with a bit of pine and some tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is a little syrpuy and the beer tastes a little hot. This is not bad, but kind of hard to drink and I think a little overrated."

"Reviewed again, fresh this time. Bottle dated 1-26-12. Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this fresh this time! Poured from bottle into Brooklyn Tulip glass. Pours a cloudy orange-golden color. Decent head, leaves about a finger of cloudy white head. A terrific looking beer. Smell- Tropical sweet hops, raw honey, citrus (orange, lemon zest), bready, with the big huge malt backbone sweetness. Yum. Taste- wow! huge hop explosion on my tongue, bitterness assault to my tongue and sides of my mouth, equally balanced by a super deep sweet honey based malt backbone. I get it. I really get why this is so talked about. I get why this gets put up there with the elite IIPAs of the world. Just so balanced, yet complex, and unique with the honey play. A terrific beer, that I wish I got in Houston."
"Overall- Excellent."
"A good lesson learned with this one. Enjoy, and be thankful for the beers from your region."
"M. Now I have a slight problem, this is too heavy and thick on the tongue. Oh well, you can't have everything."
"Overall is an excellent beer that I'm gonna be more on top of getting fresh next year."
"The taste of the beer isn't as much of a kick in the face as I expected, and that was good for me. I loved the hints of citrus in the beer while still having a strong bitter taste without dominating the entire beer. Awesome taste, great beer."
"Bell's Brewery Hopslam Ale Brewed with Honey pours a clear cherry golden color -- looks a bit like a Shirley Temple -- with a fizzy white head that quickly disappears into nothingness. The smell -- oh, the smell -- is springtime in paradise, all tropical fruits, mango and papaya, with just a hint of very mellow hoppiness. The beer is aptly named, as hops are the first thing I taste, and they're bracing, but not overwhelming, and balanced by a hint of honey sweetness. The taste lingers a long time. This is a beer to remember."
"Overall I really love this beer but as others have mentioned it def loses its surperior quality after time, don't get me wrong its still a great beer, just not over the top greatness like when fresh."
"I know people love to discuss freshness and how beers like this are worthless after a day, but this is quite delicious and I'm so glad I've had the opportunity to try it. If this is seriously better when seconds old, I'll certainly have to seek some out next year."
"O: This is the pinnacle of IPAs in my opinion. Since my first review I've had some PtE and other notables but they don't surpass hopslam. Great beer, wish it were year-round (and available in MA!). Reading my first review, it seems to hold up pretty damn well, which is more than can be said for other IPAs."
"D: Could easily drink more without being overworked with hop flavors."
"O - Such a delicious DIPA that doesn't weight you down with the body or alcohol, like so many others do."
"I wrote this review when I had my first one of the year, just forgot to publish. Hopslam starts losing flavor quickly to me, and every one I buy is guzzled as quick as possible. My wife was shocked by the smell sitting 15 feet away. She said it was the best beer she has ever smelled and I concur. Very smooth, Lots of grapefruit comes through. Love the citrus and the bitterness. This is top of the class when it comes to DIPAs."
"Cheers!"
"O- I was really excited for this one, but I was a bit let down how sweet it was."
"O: What can I say about this beer that hasn't been said. I was surprised at how much I liked this offering and really enjoyed sipping on it for an hour trying to disect the beer."
"Overall, I can easily see why this beer is so highly regarded. I was most impressed with the balance of sweetness and bitterness. To me, this is how an IPA should taste. Well done, Bell's!"
"O: For me, this beer was well worth the hype. I noticed a serious difference between fresh Hopslam and anything over a month old. The quality through its life is often debated, but I preferred it as fresh as possible."
"(revised lightly with new .25 pt rating system and tasting of 2013 bottle in Feb. 2013, and again with an 18 day old 2015 bottle in a pilsner glass)"
"The tap version is a perfect beer."
"O: This is a top 3 DIPA for me and I have had a bunch of them. I always look forward to the release of this one. I have had this on draft, cask and bottled and I would say bottled is the best. For some reason the hop presence flourishes when served in a bottle."
"Then had it from the bottle a few days later and found them to be quite different. Bottle seemed to be less citrus flavor but more honey. All in all the best IIPA I've ever had."
"O: Excellent brew from Bell's. I wish they would do this year round. Great DIPA."
"Overall this is a great year and I cant wait until next years release to try it fresh."
"Perhaps a touch thin for most but I really like the thinness. Without the chewy maltiness, this is one perfect DIPA. Perhaps this and Pliny the Elder are tops in my book. Wonderful."
"D- hands down, this is the real deal. Hopslam is so drinkable. It may be the TASTIEST brews out there. Great flavor all over. I am going to need to trade for this bad boy yearly"
"Fresh 2009 batch poured a beautiful hazy yellow with thick white head. Aroma of strong citrusy hops. Initial taste is hot with citrus and grapefruit. Sweet with hints of caramel and left a very nice hoppy taste in my mouth afterward. Alcohol is hidden very well. An aged 2008 bottle mellows out the hops and hotness and makes for a wonderful taste."
"O - Very good DIPA. I was expecting a slam of hops, and I got just that. Not as bitter as I expected, but I'm happy because of that. Seek after this fresh and get ready for the slam!"
"O: Delicious. 4"
"Serving type: On Tap and Bottle. On Tap.. I polished off 4 or 5.. I was slammed.."
"Overall: Really good beer I liked it alot."
"O: This one is great. One of the top 5 IIPAs I've ever had."
"O - If you want a great DIPA your going to have to wait next winter, but it's well worth it."
"This is great, Great, GREAT beer. Upon opening the bottle, anybody within 10 feet is treated to the wonderful floral, citrus aroma. The flavor starts light and sweet, but not for long! Shortly thereafter the hops move in, and not subtely either. This is a big beer with big flavor. I like to pair Hopslam with grilled venison chops topped with crumbled bleu cheese or BBQ ribs, as the big flavors compliment each other. This beer might not be for everybody, but those who like it, absolutely love it."
"Hop slam, I was thinking I would be overwhelmed with the tartness, citrus flavor, but I was in for a surprise. The pour resulted in a two finger head of medium thick slightly off white foam with moderate clinging lace. The color was a 6 on the SRM beer color chart and a bit hazy. The smell blew me away, not what I was expecting. Aromas of honey, flowers, citrus, a hint of toffee, and caramel. Taste is a wonderful shock. Sort of sweet to start with, flavors of honey, and caramel, then the hops come to bear with the grapefruit, lime, and pine. While I was focused on the flavor, the alcohol ambushed me like a mugger. Wow, I don't think I would drink a six of these, even though the taste would let me. I need more of this fine nectar."
"Overall, outstanding beer. The malt sweetness balances well with the prominent hop flavor. The grapefruit and herbal hop flavors mix quite well. A very unique and delicious beer."
"Now...where's my Pliny and a lighter?"
"Huge hoppy aromas emerge from the thin white head of this bright golden ale. Citrus dominates with undertones of pine, honey, caramel malt, and cinnamon. Taste is smoother that one would expect, with lots of malt to balance out a strong hops bitterness."
"Poured a dark orangish color with a good amount of white head on it. Smell is very heavy citrus with some honey and floral notes coming through - this is a very good smelling beer. The taste however left a bit to be desired for me. Nice bitterness from the hops but the honey and grapefruit flavor really turned me off. I don't know if it was too much sweetness for me or what. Mouthfeel was alright, light-medium. Overall I was pretty disappointed in this beer. After reading all the hype about it on this site, I was really excited to try it. I've had a few other IIPAs that I think are a lot better than this. I'd give it another shot down the road but until my taste changes, I won't be buying another 6-pack, that's for sure."
"Overall I feel like I either got a bad bottle, or maybe this beer is a bit over rated. I can think of many IIPA's I would rather have over this one. Too sweet for me, maybe I'll be able to try this fresh off the tap some day."
"Hopslam is one of the sweeter hop bombs out there and I really like that about it. It's heavy, but heavy with flavor!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer! I think that there are better DIPAs out there, but this Bell's offering is extremely nice."
"O- This is a great beer but not my favorite for the style."
"O: This was the first time I had ever had Hopslam, but I'm getting a few more bottles in the mail very soon. I can't wait for the day that Bell's comes to California."
"I had my hopes up with this one. I've enjoyed many of Bell's offerings (Two Hearted and Expedition are at the top of my list) but this one just falls flat. The sweetness, near cloying, leaves this brew far off balanced and while I enjoyed parts of it, the sweetness was hard to get passed. The aroma is really were this beer shined and I wish it had carried into the taste. I'm glad I got to try it but if I had to choose between Hopslam or Two Hearted, it's Two Heated I'm buying."
"T: Top notch. The hops aren't as in your face as some DIPAs, but the balance in this one is what really makes it stand out. Plenty of malt sweetness along with a lot of honey towards the middle. The finish brings back the hops and a lot of hop resin. This beer is insanely drinkable. If only I could get it out here."
"Bell's HopSlam, 12oz's into personalized """K"" snifter. Pours clear and golden, 1""" off white head dissipates rather quickly into a thin film, slight lacing left behind. Nose is too sweet for my preference in DIPA's, but considering the abv %, I was expecting something in these lines. Floral, citrus like hops shine through a bit, fighting the sweet residual malt character for the lead. Taste is of a hyped up Two Hearted, nothing more, nothing less. This beer is Two Hearted on steroids, boost the centennial's, boost the pale and crystal, and you've got HopSlam. Overall I'm not too impressed by this beer at all. Bell's has a cult following, and I honestly think they could wizz in a batch, label it PissSlam, then stick a $14.99 price tag on a 6'er, and everyone would harp about how good it is. It just doesn't live up to everyone's hype, but seeing as Ive got 17 bottles left after it hit GA three months ago, I'll be cellaring plenty! Overall, grab one or two if you see it @ a reasonable price, but I wouldn't go too far to find it. I'd rather rock a Lagunitas Hop-Stoopid for $3.49 a bomber. Cheers all!"
"O: One of the most drinkable 10% pales I've ever had. An amazing beer with strong malt, hop characteristics."
"D: Pretty darn bitter as you would expect, but the sweet malts and addition of honey make it drinkable. Good hop show going on here."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers around. This is the beer that turned me on to hoppy beers and I love it. I wish they would make it year round."
"Def all the hype! A nice head that is gone in a flash. Great aroma of pine, honey and citrus. oh so very smooth! Definitely a nice hoppy flavor but crisper than most. A with fantastic hint of honey. Definitely on of the best ales around. Can't wait to drink my 5L!"
"D - According to the label this is a """A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale""" but I don't think that description does justice to the remarkable balance for such a wonderfully hoppy beer. The bitterness that is there is clean and clear and unmistakable but not overwhelming."
"O: Exceptional beer. Great job by Bell's to create such a drinkable IPA. Quite a delight."
"Pours a golden amber with a half finger of head. A pretty touch of yellow at the rim. Head quickly dissipates leaving some sticky lacing. Nose has hints of honey, buttered biscuits, some pine and caramel candy with bitter citrus. Taste is a pleasant balance of sweet malts, grapefruit, toffee cookies with a pleasant,mellow hop bitterness. Nicely done dipa that i am happy i had the chance to try, a tad sweet but overall a well done beer and very drinkable."
"O: one of my favorite beers. Excellent all around. I can never get enough."
"I chose to list the serving type as """On Tap""" since the beer was poured from a 5 liter mini keg. Appearance was darker honey color. Not as nice looking as most DIPAs I prefer. I like a DIPA that has an orange hue rather than a reddish amber hue. Smell was too sweet for me, I am a hop head and like really hop-forward beers. The smell for me was too malty and not enough hops. Taste followed the aroma...way too sweet and malty for a good DIPA. The hops were not forward enough for me to enjoy this. It reminds me of an English style IPA more than a hop-forward DIPA. I guess I was expecting a better beer, but I get spoiled living in California, and expect the higher rated DIPAs to taste as good as the ones here do. To each his own, I guess."
"O: the only thing that will put this on my top dipa list is avalibilaty, otherwise its an amazing ipa."
"Overall. Lives up to the hype. Great DIPA that stands out from the rest. Wife says """It's good ...and smells good too""". That's pretty incredible praise when it comes to an IPA!"
"I was really excited to try this beer, as it sounded like a DIPA that I'd love. Sadly, it tasted too bitter and piney, and overall disappointing.."
"This is an incredible DIPA. Possibly the best Ive yet tried."
"Notes: Another great beer from this Kalamazoo area brewery. Although this is an extremely hoppy beer (Didn't you notice the name?), it's balanced out with the sweetness of honey to the point that non-hop lovers might even enjoy this. If you are someone who is accustomed to drinking pilsner, or any beer with the word """lite""" in it and rarely stray into the world of craft beer, this is probably not for you. In fact, please don't buy it, save it for me! However if you insist on diminishing the local supply, you can find it currently at the downtown South Bend Citywide Liquors. Feel free to post a comment with other locations you have seen this!"
"O: This is an impressive DIPA. Despite having a high alcohol content and bitter flavor, this beer is surprisingly drinkable and absolutely delicious."
"O (D) - It's interesting and very tasty, but not quite the Hopslam that I hope for. It's too well-balanced."
"O: Amazing! If you've never had it, get it. One of the best beers I've EVER had! Perfect example of a DIPA."
"This beer is why IPA's are my favorite style."
"D- Overall, an outstanding brew. 10% alcohol, I finished 12oz in about five minutes, and I'm craving another. I only have one more, so I want to save it for another night. Definitely going to trade for this one again. I think this beer is a few months old, and it is tasting fantastic. I can't even imagine what it would be like fresh."
"Hopslam, along with Dreadnaught and Pliny, is one of the three best DIPAs I have tasted. An outstanding, albeit pricey, delicious beer."
"I paired it up with some spicy Mexican fare...another great combination. Definitely worth the slightly higher-than-average price tag."
"Overall, avoid the cask. What is amazing in bottles and life changing on tap is actually awful to drink."
"Big thanks to Viggo for this one! Pours a copper orange color with a solid white head. Aroma has sweet honey and sugar with a whack of hops. Taste and mouthfeel are excellent! Great flavors of citrus, honey, caramel, and pine. Very good balance, this was not as bitter as I expected it to be. Drinkability is crazy good, I sure didn't notice the 10% abv until after I was finished!"
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Bright orange-yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a thick white head with that reduces to islands of white foamy and thick sticky lacings on the glass. Huge cirus hop aroma, citris, orange, mango, and an underlying sweet aroma as well. Smooth, thick mouth feel. The fuller side of medium bodied which subdues the carbonation a bit. Intense citrus hop and sweet honey flavor. A bit alcohol burn toward the finish. Leaves a light lingering bitter aftertaste."
"I have got to say that this is probably the best IPA that I have ever had. It starts off pouring a beautiful golden with orange highlights. The aroma is nothing but well thought out citrus characters. The Flavor is nothing shy of exceptional, as it first hits the tongue with a citrusy delight, and lingers for a while and finishes off with a floral quality that blends nicely with the subtle sweetness that the Honey in this master piece adds. The Body has been well designed to match the multitude of hop characteristics that mingle in this beer. Cheers to the brewers at Bell's for once again amazing me with this beer. Every year it never fails to please."
"Overall: I want to try this fresh very badly, I will make a better attempt next year. However, it is still delicious and I would recommend it to others."
"The bitterness rises up gently through the middle and barely hangs in there as the finish is very sweetly malty, contrary to the back label stating, """A biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale""". This is a bit of a sweetheart - a hoppy fruity ale that also has nice balance."
"O: An exceptional hop heavy DIPA with a unique balance of honey sweetness; my favorite DIPA."
"This one is a great DIPA but a little too sweet for the style for me. I like the bitter hop Doubles from the West. This bottle was marked batch 10115 which was bottled January 11th, 2011. I don't think this would lose that much bittering hop flavor in two and a half months. I do highly recommend this one though."
"Hype, schmype-- this is the real thing. My quest for the next several months will be to see what comes closest to this, for when I don't have any left. So far, no luck, but the search makes life interesting. Lusting after this beer will probably lead me to finally take up homebrewing (family, forgive me.)"
"Started our DIPA night out with the Hopslam. This beer poured with much less carbonation and head than our other DIPA's, wonder if it was a mini-keg issue? That said, the color is beautiful, darkest of the tasting, hazy and brown-gold color. The aroma was super hopped pine, citrus and sweetness. The hop flavor was much more muted than the nose would indicate. I'm getting more sweet than pine or citrus hops. This beer isn't terribly bitter but just seems disjointed with the sweet vs. hops. This finished third to an amazing dreadnaught and good exponential hoppiness."
"I am only sorry this is a seasonal beer and can't wait until next year when I can sample it again."
"overall i thought this beer would be more hype, but I found out is it is worth all the hype, one of the only ipas I could drink a few, just watch out, very strong"
" Would like to have it on draft to see how it compares to a bottle I imagine it only would get better!"
"O--This beer lived up to the hype for me, but it was not the best DIPA I have ever had. To be honest, I would not actively seek this out again, but I would never pass it up if it were available."
"M- Very interesting in the mouth. A bit dry from the Abv. There's definitely a lot going on. Maybe a bit oily."
"Overall: MOUTHGASM!!! Worth the money. Worth the hype. I'm thinking about aging this just to see what happens when the hops are gone. Or I may just drink it."
"As I sipped on this, it reminded me of my general thought of books and movies. The books [original] is always better than the movies [which are still good]. Thus was the case with the Hopslam, as I recently had a bottle and thought it was good..but nothing beats having fresh off the tap, in the house that created it!"
"Wow, what a beer this is! Beautiful in color, pours out a light golden copper with a head the sticks around till the last drop. The flavors are so luscious of fresh hops and honey the are juicy up front that dry you out making crave more. This is one great IPA!"
"O-I bought a single and will be calling my favorite libation retailer to reserve a 12 pack. Yeah to Bells, another great brew from a great Midwestern Brewery"
"D- there is no question that this beer is about the hops, and it delivers. Not in a crushing bitter way, but in an amazingly aproachable balanced way that showcase the many flavors of hops."
"Bottle into tulip. This beer is top-notch, although the hop-lover in me sheds a silent tear every time I enjoy one (and enjoy them I do), because the top-tier hops combination is slightly masked by the honey, which detracts ever so slightly from what makes me appreciate the best double ipa's. Nevertheless, its drinkability is outstanding for an imperial, and I truly enjoy what is becoming Bell's most sought-after beer on the market."
"Overall - a great beer and well worth the wait. I thought it was very similar to Abrasive, but fell a little short of PTE."
"O: I was looking forward to trying this based on all the hype it receives on BA, and I wasn't let down. The presence of the honey doesn't make this a particularly drinkable beer for me because my palate doesn't enjoy beers with much sweetness. But the complexity, uniqueness, and execution of the style is undeniable. A great beer."
"This beer is beautiful. The price though, it's steep. $20 a 6 pack is pretty outrageous. If you can, grab a bottle, and savor."
"O: Great brew that I would love to have again and again if only I could get my hands on it. So far, in my limited beer Odyssey, this is the best beer I have ever had."
"Grab one up any time you see one!"
"A buddy of mine smuggled be a bottle from PA and the results were great. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be. Very smooth finish. Full body. I assume the honey used in the wort reduced the hoppy bite finish. Exceptional taste. Great beer. Best IPA I have had."
"O: 2 months later, the hop fade is a lark. This is as good as the hopslam I drank on Jan 31st. Fantastic beer"
"I think this was best described by a hop head friend of mine that said """it goes down so smooth that you don't realize it till its gone.""" Very well spoken Mike Lee!"
"O- all I'm all this brew is amazing. I know its not the freshest it can be but its still a wonderful brew. I will try to get some fresher stuff next year and will revisit my review."
"This is the first time I was prompted for overall vice drinkability I would have to say overall this is exceptional but definitely boy a session beer. Thanks to Sully for the export. Pours adecent golden with mild head and nice lacing. Smell is a great obey citrus mess. Taste is like the name. Plenty citrus grapefruitvwith a sweet honey feel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but not syrupy like a 90 min."
"Edited after finishing the 6 pack...I looked less and less forward to each beer in this 6-pack, anticipating the ever-present Yankee Candle Christmas Pine-Tree aroma. As I compared it with other beers in my fridge, I found it the least appealing and by beer number 5, was looking forward to saying goodbye. I've at least learned to appreciate good balance in a beer and will probably not favor too many of the high-hops choices that are out there. No more Hopslam for me."
"Overall: I love this beer. Both a hophead's dream, and a great entry into the world of imperial IPA's. If you see it, drink it."
"O-This is good stuff. One of the more balanced DIPAs, and the addition of honey is a welcome change of pace. Very good."
"O- Great...period (or three periods)"
"I probably can't add anything useful to what has already been written about this outstanding beer, but here goes. Pours a beautiful golden color with nice head and great lacing on the glass. The aroma is exceptional- very fruity, notes of peaches and of course hops. The taste is unbelievable. Without a doubt the most well balanced double IPA there is. Just the right amount of sweetness to offset the bitterness of the hops. I know this is an overly hyped beer, but in this case the accolades are true. If (god forbid) I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would undoubtedly be my choice."
"The high ABV is concealed well, too. This is a superior IPA, and one I'll definitely re-experience again."
"D- This beer is a great DIPA that doesn't dominate in the boozy category. Highly drinkable, i can dig it!"
"Amber in color with soap-sud foam. Aroma packs a punch - some piney hops but mostly grapefruit. Flavor is grapefruit hop flavor and bitterness that sticks. Some caramel sweetness just peeking through at the end. Most excellent. Not better than Dreadnaught, but about equal in overall impact. Just a bit different."
"Overall: for an IPA is great. I'm not one who really prefers an extremely hoppy beer, or maybe one thats just hops and nothing else. This beer has a nice equilibrium to it, honey and hops, sweet and bitter."
"D - Big fan of this brew. For a double IPA that rings in at 10%, you can't really go wrong with this one. Not highly drinkable but definitely good for a couple of bottles in one session."
"Drinkability is great. This is one of the best beers I've had, and hands down the best DIPA out there. Pick this one up if you ever see it."
"as being called hopSLAM and claiming its a """tongue bruiser""" is a little far fetched for what they were going for. but being as sweet as it is, makes this for an enjoyable and drinkable Imperial."
"This beer is to savor not to drink so I cant say its highly drinkable as in consumable but as far as coming back to this beer, if only it was always available...."
"you can taste this biiiter hops in this one but no where as much as nugget necatar. this beer is more about the large amounts of pale malt and alcohol wich is typical of a DIPA. mouth feel is creamy."
"I've never had a 10 % beer that is so well balanced between the high gravity, hops and malt character. Popping open a bottle and pouring produces a wonderful citrusy/grapefruit aroma. A truly fantastic creation by Bell's, if you are a fan of simcoe hops this is beer must be on your TRY NOW list!"
"d: I could see myself sipping this in the summer one after another...though great any time of the year for sure. Nice and refreshing and absolutely love that taste of honey in here."
"overall: a stand up DIPA, but it fell just a bit short of my expectations. the honey was there, and made for almost a wierd aroma and flavor. next year ill try and get some fresher stuff, but im still very glad i got the chance to try this beer."
"D: Great drinkability, I wish I had a 6-pack left for tonight. Another beer that hasn't made it's way to MA."
"A damn good DIPA. The smell beats out the taste for me, but for a 10% DIPA this is definitely among the smoothest, tastiest ones around. Happy to finally try this legendary beer and looking forward to my next one."
"Comments: If you didn't tell me this beer was a 10% ABV. beer, I'd think it was just a very good IPA. I prefer the Two-Hearted Ale in terms of flavor and complexity. The drink on this bad boy, though, is where it stands out. It's a borderline session beer in terms of how easy it goes down . . . If you're a rich alcoholic, this could be your beer of choice. I could put away a sixer in an hour or two if I didn't know better."
"great clasic can't wait til the hops fade next year!"
"Drinkability: I've drank a whole growler by myself before without even noticing until feeling the slam the next morning.. It is like an prank on your senses. As soon as you set down the glass, you can't escape, you strive for another sip, its eggs you on until you stand up, fall down and attempt to get up once more. That is the when you know you have been hopslammed. The only way to out is to drink on. Cheers!"
"I get that this is a desirable brew, but I don't get the insane mega hype people raise over the beer either. Definitely not the best DIPA out there."
"D: I really like this beer but I don't remember it being so hot in years past. Anyway, a legendary beer by Bell's. I wish it wasn't so hot though."
"I really loved this beer but I felt as though the name implies something that it isn't. It's delicious and the honey gives it a remarkable character-- but it isn't as hoppy as, say, Nugget Nectar despite its claims."
"D: Very good for a 10%. Overall a very solid DIPA, although the upfront sweetness is somewhat of an oddity for this style. IMO, Pliny beats it easily. It is not a """conventional""" DIPA I believe, due to the flip in the flavor profile (honey sweetness upfront, followed by hops). While the results are quite delicious, world class, even, if all the reviewers here are to be believed, it still pales in comparison to the epitome of the style, Pliny."
"D - Awesome beer, but the drinkability is just good. At 10% ABV, it's an aggressive beer, but the flavor is one that I would like to be able to have a few of without getting smashed."
"definetly worth every penny especially since i first tried it before i heard all the hype, by far my best and favorite beer"
"Not sure the alcohol hides well but I don't really mind. Nice one from bells."
"Drinkability - maybe not a favorite of mine because I don't love bitter beers, but still very good in style, complexity, interesting progression. Very good brew!"
"D- Despite this having lost some of its hop freshness, or at least what I have concluded, this is still really drinkable. The abv is not tasted but felt a little in the mouth. I'd love to try this fresh and might re-review this next year. It's a drink now or forever your hops are weak if you wait too long with these beers. I'd like to chalk up a win for Nugget Nectar against this(even though not a DIPA) but I'll have to revisit this in the future when fresh."
"After the first few sips, I let this warm up considerably before really focusing on it for review. Although the flavors became more apparent, so did the heat to a minor extent. Not saying it """hurt""" the beer at all in my ratings, just thought it was worth pointing out. And also that I enjoyed it even more after it had thawed out a bit...Cheers Bell's!"
"Batch #10127. Got in a trade from Schriebeers. Thanks man! I guess this is about two months old so not ideal. Pours a really nice amber color with a small white head. Pine, pineapple and honey on the nose. Definitely a lot of hops and not much malt. The taste is exceptional. Hops, hops and more hops. The honey really shines through and is pretty drinkable for 10% ABV. I would really love to try this fresh. On the other hand I wonder what it would taste like with a few years on it. A great beer!"
"D - One of the most drinkable DIPAs you will find. You'll only realize the ABV is 10% when you try to stand up."
"Comparing it casked to bottled, it's pretty much what you'd think. Less carbonation and chill, and thus a little more flavor poking through. All the same, I prefer it bottled. The heaviness of the beer and the intensity of its honey-hopped notes lend themselves to some cooler-carbonated levity. I'm really glad I had the chance to grab this casked, since it really does allow you to get at some of those notes a little more accurately, but the trade off in drinkability I think sends the beer over the edge."
"I got a finger-and-a-half of soapy ecru head with decent retention off of my pour. Color was a solid amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Yeah, give this to the kiddies. Nose was so piney that I began to swoon. It was, in my addled mind, like licking a pine tree. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops had already begun to mute, so the taste was heavier on caramel malt, but I still got some hops on the tongue. The finish was likewise caramel-like initially, but lingering with hops. Dang, but I would like to try this absolutely fresh! No matter, I CAN now die h(a/o)ppy, having had some. Did I mention the excellent lacing throughout? Glug!"
"Overall: The beer didn't convert our non-ipa fans that were good sports and participated. Those who did like it described it as a good summertime sipping beer. Others likened it to """mixing Oberon with Two-Hearted."
"This is a very nice beer. The ABV is hidden fairly well though not entirely and the sweetness is welcome here. Reminiscent of a nugget nectar but with a stronger hop bill and bigger ABV. Still a true DIPA. Definitely happy I tried this. Only wish I had more than just the one bottle."
"D - Very drinkable. The 10% abv here is nowhere to be found. The balance here is fantastic and the hop profile is really really nice."
"D- Very easy to drink and the 10% alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the smell. A great DIPA I wish I could by it near me!"
"This on cask was one of the best beers I've ever had."
"Overall, a great, balanced imperial IPA. I loved the tropical fruit notes and the prevailing sweetness. I can only imagine this is even more impressive fresh."
"Overall, this was just mediocre in my opinion. I think I ruined this by having some really exceptional IPAs within the last couple of weeks, and this really didn't compare. Less complex, flavorful, and off balance a bit. Not bad, but I have no problem waiting another year for this one, and probably won't think about it much between now and then."
"Hops hit you up front and then there's sweet malts too, and an amazing smooth honey finish. The unique blend of hops, honey, drinkability and high ABV make this beer a true standout."
"No doubt this is a very well crafted beer but something was missing for me to set it apart as exceptional."
"D: An excellent DIPA. It's a little sweet fort taste, but I would love to have another."
"Overall this was definitely one of the better double ipas I've had, however even knowing that it's a big beer I wish it was still a little more drinkable."
"D- 4 This beer is pretty drinkable for its style. This is a matter of personal preference for me; I'm not the biggest hop-head out there but as imperial IPAs go I could drink as many of these as any. It definitely has a 'kick' to it, though, so be careful! Always an annual treat worth picking up."
"D: Again, the booziness and bitterness make this beer tough to throw back. I like DIPA's...I've even had very quaffable ones that are around 9-10%. But I put this beer down after two sips and a friend took over."
"M/D: bitter, sip one bottle slowly, very strong but very tasty"
"D - Sails right down...two or three of these and you're easily done for the night, but because of the alcohol content and not drinkability issues."
"Drinkability- Good for a DIPA, definitely not a hopbomb for me and would be easy to enjoy a few."
"D- I look forward to Hopslam every year and don't mind the price. Nice perk to living near Kzoo is Bell's addition of Hopslam during the summer. I drink multiple snifters when given a chance and rarely grow tired of it."
"Outside of a handful of beers, such as PtE and Dark Lord, there are few beers that are as hyped as Hopslam. Though good, I just feel like it isn't deserving of the devotion this beer inspires. This is coming from someone that had friends drive 2 hours to a distributor to buy cases and a mini-keg from a distributor (I live in PA). I think that the beer has a very nice hoppy aroma, but is it better than most good, fresh DIPA (probably not). There are smells of wildflower meadow, spruce resin, grapefruit rind, and sweet orange. The beer is definitely hoppy, but the flavor doesn't jump out at me as the best I've ever had. The honey definitely is present in the flavor, but it has a bit of an artificial McDonald's """honey""" tanginess. The beer is too thin with too much alcohol (probably from the added honey) that is definitely present on the tongue that contributes to the perceived bitterness of the beer. The beer is tasty and finishing 1 or 2 is not a problem. But you'll definitely suffer palate fatigue after about half a glass from the alcohol and hops and then you won't really know what you're tasting afterwards."
"If you can find it and afford it, buy it. Not my favorite."
"Absolutely loved this beer. One of my favorites. Nice color, had a great smell to it, taste was excellent, especially given the alcohol content. Very smooth with a clean finish. Picked up a very discrete honey flavor which helped the smoothness, as well as the citrus. Drinkability is dangerously good."
"One of my favorite parts of this beer is also one of the only things I can fault it for. The addition of honey really gives this a unique flavor profile, but the added alcohol percentage and the heavier mouthfeel makes this one slightly harder to be sessionable. I love the beer overall, but I would have to limit myself to probably 2 bottles in a night."
"Mouthfeel is perfect for a DIPA -- not too syrupy/thick, not too thin. Well carbonated, too. Overall, this is a very good DIPA, just not the most exceptional example I've tasted."
"D. Really good considering the ABV but this will hit you like sledgehammer as my sister found out last night! This is one of the best DIPA's I have had to date, A must try!"
"You could have many of these because they are so light and fruity. They would be terrific on a summer day... just keep your head on straight, it may sneak up and slam you down."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Great beer - will definitely always seek out. Still have a couple left from the sixer, but understand that with a bottling date of Jan 5, and a drink date of Feb 26, it wasn't at it's freshest. Will try a fresher one next year and review again."
"Batch 10101 (Jan. 4th, 2011) Thanks to my nephew Nic! This is not easy, but have to say this is the best beer I've enjoyed the past three years. It gets my highest rating to date (surpassing Orval and FFF's Alpha King). Aroma? You bet - simply awesome. The taste is second to none, with the good bitter finish. THAT is what puts this beer over the top - so many IPAs/DIPAs may lean to the sweet side - not this brew. Perfection. A classic beer that I am so glad to have two bottles of. So wonderful I am saving the 2nd for tomorrow night - PROST!"
"Hop slam is my personal fav beer. I wish Bell's would produce this beer year round! The color was golden honey. With a i finger head. taste wise this beer was a home run.. OR slam DUNK!! It has a nice hoppy flavor but was exceptionally balanced by citrus and honey flavor. My palate picked up on orange and grapefruit flavors. I can not say enough about this brew I was lucky to find 2 six packs here in florida this beer sells out in a day!"
"On cask during Flying Saucer Raleigh's 11th anniversary, served in a tulip glass a slightly hazy orange with a thin diminishing head that lasts as a ring. Aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops with a bit of pine and caramel. The taste is a nice amount of citrus hops, sweet malts and slight pine and caramel, nice and complex. The beer is very smooth and easy drinking from the cask conditioning. This is an excellent example of what an IPA should be on cask!"
"D- Drinkability is there with the alcohol being masked by the huge hops"
"Wow! This is a great beer! Obviously, you will first encounter a sweetened hop taste, which is definitely ok! The beer itself is a beautiful creamy orange color, with minimal head and carbonation. The aroma too is ladened with a hops feel as it should be and is smooth going down. This beer is outstanding. The only downside to this beer is that its $20 for a 6 pack, but if there is any beer worth it, it would be Hopslam! If you have not tried it, you are missing out!"
"Pretty fantastic if you ask me. Seek out this tap."
"Overall I am glad I tried it. However, in the future I may not hunt it down like I did this time. It is a decent IIPA but by far not may favorite."
"if i don't have this ever again, i will be sad, but i'd be ok with it, too, as it has such a unique grasp on the style."
"My first Hopslam and happy to try it. Pours a nice semi-translucent dark gold. Head is billowy and sticks around for a short time. Good lacing around the rim of the glass. The nose falls short for me; not bad by any means but nothing out of the ordinary. Good sweet, sugary pine but soft. Not overbearing. Taste is really nice but not as bracingly hoppy as the label states. In fact it is softer than I could've imagined but that could be due to freshness. The bitterness hits the side of the tongue for a moment but then leaves quickly. Not much sting afterward. There is a nice balance to this beer between malt and hop but I'd love more intense hop. Still good though. Mouthfeel is great. Fairly viscous but with good carbonation and makes me want another taste. I dunno how many of these I could drink as the alcohol is present and the mouthfeel, while great, could get taxing. But I like it."
"Highly recommend at least giving it a shot."
"Pours a golden yellow with amazing clarity and a crisp white head. My FW pint glass is happy to contain it. Head recedes after a few minutes into a ring that leaves mild lacing on the sides of the glass. This beer smells incredible, citrus fruits, pineapple are up front and do a great job representing the hops with a mild hop sweetness coming though at the end of each whif. Upon tasting this beer i expected it to be boozy for how light it is but instead you get a blast of hop flavor and a much needed malty backbone to hold the beer together, completely masking the alcohol. This beer is light and crisp, something you don't see with many Double IPA's. Where this beer lacks hop bitterness (what can i say i'm a Portland hophead) it makes up for in hip aroma and profile. I could drink this beer all day."
"(105th)"
"Hopslam differs in that it is slightly more sweet and sticky no doubt from the honey. It also finishes a little quieter, which is a little disappointing. All in all this beer is a winner, and deserves the praise it gets."
"Drinkability- very high...it is very smooth and the 10% ABV is easily masked...only faint alchohol as it warms...just too hard to get in NYC"
"I like beer that is more multidimensional."
"Pours a clear orange colour with thick whit head. Some lacing on the glass, with nice head retention. Smells of resiny pine hops with some citrus and lots of sweet caramel malt. Flavour has a really nice sweetness to it, then the bitterness hits you. Leaves the piney hops as a wonderful after-taste. Very smooth mouthfeel. Easily one of the best double IPA's I've had. This beer did live up to the hype."
"D - This is a better batch than last year inwhich i did not review since i probably would have given it a C."
"A must! Too lazy to post specifics but it is definitely in my top 5 beers. Pineapple and Grapefruit in the smell and taste and bitterness is just right."
"YES it is expensive 16-20 a 6 pack. @ 10% alcohol and the malt to mask it, youll understand why."
"Bottled Jan 5, 2011. Pours a clear golden-orange color with a frothy 2-finger head that slowly recedes, leaving lots of lacing. Smell is, as expected, a slam of hops. Citrusy, piney goodness, with a touch of bitterness on the back end. First sip almost knocked me over. Strong floral hops that are quickly followed by a wave of intense bitterness. There's a nice sweetness lingering there behind the hops that makes the slam a bit more gentle. The impressive thing about this beer is the variety of hop flavors that come through. Though I suspect, based on others' descriptions, that it would be even more intense if it were fresher. Mouthfeel is a bit tingly, fairly light, but lingers in the mouth. This is a very intense, very hoppy DIPA. While it's not exactly my cup of tea (IPAs in general aren't), I can see why it's so highly regarded."
"First year having this, and it is as hyped, amazing! I picked up 8 singles from a local store, at 2.50$ they were well worth it. The beer pours a orange color with a massive white head, 3-4 fingers worth. Hops up front, followed by a rush of citrus, and pine, prefect balance of the two. I expected this beer to be overwhelming with alcohol content but it wasn't even noticed even towards the bottom of the glass. Upset I haven't picked up more, I would have purchased a case at least. Overall this beer lives up to the hype, and is one I will enjoy each and every spring."
"D-- ABV is very apparent in the drinking. A slow sipper. Unique due to using honey but makes this stand out over other DIPA's due to that. Would be interested to see how this is without the honey. No way I could do more than one in a sitting. Hurts in the drinkability department. Great beer that packs a lot of punch and does meet the hype."
"This beer is delicious and deceptively strong. When it first hits your tongue, you feel the hoppy bite, but then when it goes down, a smoothness transforms it in such a fashion like nothing else I've ever tasted. It's a treat and highlight to the beer year when it arrives at the local stores in town. But be careful - the ease at the finish is where you can mess yourself up. With the high ABV plus the easy drink-ability, you can quickly find yourself heading off the rails if you try to down more than 2!"
"D- i wasn't impressed with the first couple bottle that i had of this, however, on this review the flavors and smells were much better balanced than i remember, a nice one to sip especially at the price"
"Juicy, round mouthfeel with a body that seems light for the alchohol content. Dangerously drinkable for the alcohol, but the sweetness builds to overtake the experience and forms a natural brake on drinking this beer too quickly."
"Missing the aftertaste of the hops is my only concern."
"Drinkability: I'd prefer something more fruitier and drier myself, but this made for a very nice sipper."
"The beer pours a just short of translucent tangerine in my glass. The foamy white crown rises to about three fingers in height. It quickly reduces in size by about a third before settling in and just sitting there. While the head retention is more than solid, lacing is a bit spotty. There's an incredibly pungent and perfumey aroma wafting up from the glass. A faint suggestion of honey is almost drowned out by the massive hop notes bombarding my nose. Waves of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange, and even a little peach crash over my olfactory sense. The flavor runs along similar lines, and is outstanding, but lacks a little bit of the oomph that the aroma has. The hop bitterness is fairly pronounced, but falls in line sandwiched between a beguilingly subtle, yet flavorful sweetness, and the array of powerful hop flavors. The mouthfeel is spot on, just enough heft in the body to support the massive hops, without getting in the way. At the same time the carbonation is active enough to really get the tropical hop flavors bursting on my palate, without giving too much of a bubbly sensation. There's not even a hint of alcohol, and it's absolutely mind boggling that a 10%, hopped out of its mind DIPA can be this easy to drink. A phenomenal beer from Bell's, and one of a very few that I would readily buy a whole case of at any time."
"D: This is a masterpiece DIPA and very accessible and delicious for even non-hopheaded beer lovers."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs and I thought it was time to review it. This beer is what makes January in Michigan managable for me. The beer pours a medium orange in color with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is very intense and is of mostly citrusy hops. This is by far one of the most robust, quality smelling beers I've had of this style. The taste is definately hop forward, but the honey balanced it out nicely. There's lots of citrus in the flavor, but a little bit of pine as well, and a touch of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is outstanding as the beer has the perfect amount of carbonation and a great feel. This is my go-to late winter beer."
"D: Really easy for 10%. Now I wish this was a year round offering."
"medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. pretty damn drinkable considering its double-digit ABV. hopslam's fans are legion so there's not much to say about this one that hasn't already been said, but it receives that hype for a reason."
"Conclusion: This is one beer that would not fail the blindfold test for either taste or smell. Despite all the hype surrounding this beer, don't be fooled. Don't pass up the chance to try this one, over and over again."
"D. very smooth.. wish I could drink all year long."
"Drinkability is good. Very sneaky at 10% ABV. There really is no hint of the alcohol at all, which is also surprising. At times the honey sweetness can be a bit much and even seem to outweigh the hops. Perhaps this wasn't as fresh as possible but should still be a good sample with it being bottled less than a month before consumption."
"Waited to try Pliny before I reviewed this so I wouldn't overrate it. It actually wasn't too far behind for me though. Very good beer."
"D: For 10% ABV I think this goes down very easy. Can be dangerous!"
"At 10% alcohol this went down super easy. One of the smoothest and best IPA's I've had."
"Serving type: Bottle."
"This had a white head that left quickly, not many bubbles hung around. A very light colored IPA with minimal cloudiness. Smells very smooth for a name like Hopslam. The sour is there, but almost as fruity in smell. The taste is different though...only hops in the initial sip. The aftertaste tones down the drink perfectly, must be the honey. Its not fruity in taste at all, just hops and a smooth undertone which makes it quite drinkable. Just read the bottle cuz I was starting to realize it was high - at 10%ABV (holy crap) this is an amazingly smooth beer!"
"Overall: About as perfect a DIPA as you’ll ever find. There is nothing to complain about here (aside from the price). I really wish Bell’s would make this a year-round release and drop the price a bit. If they did, this would be my go to beer without a doubt. If you see it, buy it. Don’t let the sticker shock stop you from trying the perfection that is Hopslam."
"D - Got this in a BIF and I'm very happy I got to try this highly rated DIPA. It's a bit too boozy for my liking however."
"Drinkability you would think would be iffy at 10% abv, but it masks it SO well. Before you know it, you'll be feeling it. A top flight beer. Revisiting this, it's tough to decide if this is my favorite IPA or not besides the great Ruination. Either way, absolutely would recommend this to any hop fanatic. A great beer!"
"It's funny. Hopslam is receiving a really high rating here from me, and when I had it side by side with Abrasive from Surly, Abrasive carried the day. But on its own, Hopslam has some wonderfully subtle characteristics. I highly recommend you get some while it's still fresh."
"This is an incredibly drinkable beer for being 10%. Once I got used to the honey sweetness it really has a nice balance that I can see why people are fond of it."
"A delightful DIPA, perfect balance and awfully drinkable."
"Drinkability: I've had this several times and it's always wonderful. I'll definitely be having more in the future."
"hopslam set the bar pretty damn high for all others, cant wait to try many more...."
"D. One of the first nights of the year I've been able to comfortably sit on my porch and enjoy a wonderful brew. Damn this feels great."
"D- Excellent beer, very easy to consume. Alcohol is hidden very well which makes it a very enjoyable and easy drink. Great bite, hits you hard with the hoppiness than calms down in your palate. I will definitely be drinking this beer for years to come."
"All I have to say is, WOW!!! This is a true masterpiece in brewing. It felt like a sin to drink something so perfect. Without a doubt, the best double IPA I have tried to date (or may ever try.) Hats off to the fine people at Bell's!"
"I think this is a delicious IPA. It's really drinkable and has heavy hop aroma and flavor. But I paid $25 for a six pack....which is a little ridiculous."
"THis is in my 5 TOp beers at the moment. Haven't tried a ton but for an IPA this is exceptional"
"D: One in a sitting is the limit here, tried having a second bottle as it was just too much for my palate. Grab one a savor it!"
"doesn't taste like a """bruiser of an ale""" as the bottle claims....could be my lupulin threshold shift..."
"I definitely am a fan of this fistful of hoppy goodness and definitely rank this as one of my top IPA's"
"Well this is a pretty damn drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it being a hop forward beer and am really glad I got to try it again (I had it two years ago or so and don't remember it at all). Is it worth all the hype? That can only be answered by the individual drinker. For me, I really enjoyed it and would seek it out again next year."
"Notes: If you every get the chance to try this one it is worth every penny. I had extremely high expectations due to all the hype surrounding this beer and this one lived up to the hype and even surpassed it. Absolutely amazing"
"D: Wow, it's a good thing this stuff isn't sold here in upstate NY as this is a very drinkable beer with high alcohol content makes for one dangerous combination."
"Overall: Hands down Bell's best."
"PHENOMENAL, MUST TRY!"
"I'd take a fresh Two Hearted over this any day..."
"Edit #2 - 2013 not as kind for this. Three separate on-tap experiences of this year's release all left me underwhelmed. Docking for consistency."
"I'll definitely be trading for the mini keg next year."
"Verdict - I was happy to see that Hopslam lived up to it's good expectations. It was packed with bitter and sweet tastes that blended perfectly together. I thought I had missed my window to get this for this year, but I was lucky enough for the bar to have two bottles left."
"A good beer not stellar."
"Great stuff."
"D - Just a nice drink from all aspects. A real great beer."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a thinnish white head that dissipates too quickly. Smells of pine resin and citrus up front. Hints of sweet fruit, grass and honey lie deep underneath the resinous onslaught. Taste is sweeter than the aroma leads you to believe. There's a solid malt backbone here with a sweet honey taste that drives this brew. Pine, citrus and tropical fruits add to a spicy/herbal taste in the fairy sweet finish. Medium body and carbonation level, sweet less than syrupy mouthfeel. I've sampled a couple of IPA's tonight and this one is the sweetest. Very flavorful, very tasty, Matt should get me some more."
"Slightly thinner than many of my favorite imperial IPAs, the carbonation is well balanced with the consistency of the brew. A phenomenally enjoyable, drinkable, and misleadingly high in alcohol beer. Approach this one carefully, as the 10% will definitely sneak up on you. Definitely one of the best Jan-Feb seasonals that are widely available, I will be seeking it out again, though it doesn't sit in my top 5 ever."
"Major thanks to given2flybrewing for these. Poured into an mason jar with a wide mouth and it looks good. Puffy white head that clings onto the glass adrift on a light honey golden liquid. The aroma is where my journey to slight disappointment begins. Yes there are nice tropical fruit notes, mango, pinapple, and citrus along with light pine...but it is not so pungent and less then wowing. I also find the flavor to be muted. The components are there, nice honey note accents well citrus, tropical fruit and zesty earth tones the hops bring to the beer. Mouthfeel is not cloying and easy sipping for such a large beer, possibly the biggest success of the beer. So I am willing to admit that perhaps I didn't get the freshest bottle of hopslam, but until I taste it fresher I am underwhelmed and believe this beer is overhyped."
"Bell's, You have restored my faith... This is one IPA i would be proud to say was a San Diego beer. An absolute Home Run"
"Pleasantly surprised by the drinkability of this beer, although I still wouldn't have more than a couple in one sitting -"
"Drinkability is EXCEPTIONAL for the 10% abv, as you don't even notice it until the end, when it is simply a welcome taste and feeling. This beer balances itself out, and although you may not be able to taste anything else for while, this on its own goes down as easy as just about any beer out there, regardless of style. Beast of a beer."
"Overall a serious DIPA. Smooth and tasty."
"I find that when I go home to Chicago, I'm not as impressed with the IPA's. With the onslaught of brews available year round in CA, my palate may be spoiled..."
"I was really skeptical that I would like this beer that much. I had forgotten that it was 10% ABV until I started drinking it and it drank like a 5% beer. Wonderful all around."
"D: Everyone is raving about this beer its not a bad brew just not my taste."
"D - wow, even with a little heat at the end this does not drink like a 10% brew, very well balanced considering the IBUs, sweet enough to go down easy but not too syrupy"
"OVR: A well done and well balanced DIPA. Lots of hype with this one and worth seeking out when fresh. Not quite up to pandemonium level it currently has though..."
"This beer truly lives up to its hype. The hop profile is in your face and assaults your taste buds. It is a IIPA that keeps people coming back year after year. I know that I will be buying this beer on a yearly basis, so everyone needs to do themselves a favor and just buy this beer."
"A very drinkable high ABV beer. Didn't get a strong alcohol flavor AT ALL. The only thing bringing down its drinkability is the sweet flavor, which becomes too much after a while."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a light amount of carbonation. Big abv warmth and taste yet balanced and very enjoyable and drinkable. The honey aspect to this brew gives my sense of taste mixed signals. There seems to be a sweetness about this brew mid palate that turns sharp and dry into the finish. This is a well made brew that every hop lover needs to try."
"All around a great beer, worth the big bucks for the 6pack."
"Verdict: With only minor flaws, this is truly a wonderful and near-elitle ale worth tracking down."
"D: The beer is rather drinkable without a strong alcoholic presence that is rather surprising. The mouthfeel is exactly what I would want it to be."
"Verdict: So I'm determined that this may just well be the best damn beer I've reviewed thus far and I'll probably be getting a sixer of these every January for the rest of my days on earth. A wonderfully charismatic and exciting beer. Does well in nearly all respects. If I have to pick one bad thing out it is the ABV which is fine at high levels but isn't """ideally""" concealed and still peeks through at times, most notably in the mouthfeel. Just wonderful, but you need to drink it when it's fresh to enjoy it best. This is one of those beers that doesn't age very well, so drink 'em while you've got 'em! And enjoy... you're one lucky bastard to have this worthy beer in your hand! A (4.5)"
"Dangerously drinkable for it's high alcohol. I really tried to find some kind of flaw in this beer given all the hype around it, but I just couldn't find any. I will have to start stocking up on this stuff every January. It's a shame it isn't year round, I know the demand is there. Come on Bell's!"
"Have only made one pilgramage to Bell's and obviously timed it incredibly wrong last summer. Will make every effort to find this beer in the future!"
"D:Super easy drink for the high ABV with delicious taste to back it up. Don't worry the hype is true when these are fresh really a all around great brew and in my opinion one of the third coast best DIPA offerings."
"D- drinkable to an extent, definitely a good sipper. Delicious and will definitely enjoy again."
"Pours clear golden with a great dense white head. Leaves great lacing and holds a good amount of head throughout drinking. Aroma is very floral, I smell pineapple, papaya, oranges/tangerines, grapefruit, some honey. Flavor is resinous hops, tropical fruits, citrus, and a good deal of honey.. This beer dangerously drinkable! Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied, sticky, medium carbonation."
"D-I had to check the back of the bottle again and make sure this was really 10%, dangerously drinkable, with a great flavor, drink at your own risk."
"Opinion: Well, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It is much more balanced than some of the brewery's """Tribute to hops""" beers are. Mostly they are just stupidly hopped beer without regard to balance, but this beer is actually a good base to begin with and then they put a S**t load of hops in it. The result is very good. Even though I am a malt-head and don't drink hoppy beers much, I would definitely drink this beer again...and that is saying something. Give it a shot. If you like flavorful beer, this one won't disappoint you."
"Finally got to try this one after hearing all the hype. Pours hazy orange with a nice two finger head. Aroma of sweet citrus, grapefruit, orange and honeysuckle. Nicely balanced leaning toward the sweeter, less floral side for me, definitely notice the honey. So easy to drink that the ABV makes this one quite dangerous for me. No alcohol until the very end and by the time I notice it I am taking another sip. Really enjoyed this one and will certainly seek out when the season permits."
"The beer has a medium body, with a certain viscous element to it. It is well carbonated, and finishes dry. This is an incredibly drinkable double IPA."
"Insanely intense hop aroma hits as soon as you open the bottle. Pours a clear copper with a minimal white head. The overload of hops give this brew a very earthy, almost citrus smell and taste. Good carbonation and definitely a beer a hop head will love."
"I'm a huge fan of the IPA's that don't have a huge malt profile, and this one tops them all. Excellent beer, and totally worth all of the hype."
"defnitely in my top 5 beers"
"d: I find this beer to be a drinkable beer but probably with a limit of two. You definitely know you are drinking a DIPA but it's satisfying and somewhat refreshing."
"Drinkability: I was saving this for the Steeler's Superbowl win but alas it was not meant to happen. Very drinkable and world watch out I'm rady to drink more than one."
"Drinkability: Very drinkability but noticing less hop impact compared to last year's batch. Still one of my favorite IPAs but I'm also noticing a quick hop decline since I opened the first bottle so make sure you enjoy this beer in the immediate future."
"D: Very drinkable. A little more bitter than I remember Hopslam being. Overall an incredible beer that could be dangerous at 10%"
"D- ridiculously drinkable. I'd love to have another, ABV is very hidden, if unaware it can sneak up on you. I am probably one that enjoys this beer with a couple weeks of age on it, as I had one from the same batch at the beginning of January and didn't find it nearly as appealing. Time allows it to mellow just a bit and let the honey become a bigger part of the beer."
"One of my absolute favorites. I only wish that hops flavor would last longer since this is a only released once a year. Hopslam is a beer that reminds you to enjoy life in the moment and to accept that there are some things you just can't hold on to for long."
"This was a delicious beer, there was so much complex flavor, and it was dangerously easy to drink."
"d - delicious beer but i prefer it on draught or in bottle."
"This is an awesome beer I have 2 6pks and am missing it already. Wish Bells had this as a year around but Im sure if they did my taste buds would be burnt out from all the Hopslamy awesomeness."
"Absolutely delicious."
"."
"Leaves a nicely dry aftertaste. Excellent double IPA."
"D: Other than the price, this is a really good football beer. It had better be anyway...the super bowl is on. ALso at ten percent it kinda sneaks in and doesn't let you know how big it really is. Be careful with this one. Drink it at home or with a DD."
"A little too bitter for me to be great, but a good solid beer. A little too much money for me though."
"I had this batch 10115(january 11,2011) several times, as in just a week old and the honey in this brew was way too sweet for my liking, but as for today(february 6,2011) the sweetness of the honey seems to be fading and the hop presence and bitterness is the highlight of this brew!!"
"Fantastic as always, although the honey and malt seem more apparent in the 2011 batch than the ones I enjoyed last year. Do slightly prefer the mini-keg version to bottles on this year's batch as the appearance is a notch better as well as increased bitterness."
"Drinks well but wouldn't be an everyday beer. It's a bit over the top, and would be fine for an occasional sipper."
"Despite the high alcohol this is surprisingly drinkable. Too bad it's a seasonal brew because I'm counting the days til it's triumphant return."
"this beer pours a nice slightly hazy orange color with a thick white head. The citrus hop aroma from this one is great, grapefruit smell really comes through. the beers name really comes through in the flavor, my palate was slammed by hops citrusy and very bitter a little bit of alcohol warmth. there is good carbonation and the beer is very drinkable at 10%"
"D - I would drink this one over and over again. One of the best beers I have ever had bar none. Simply phenomenal, hats off to Bell's for a creating such a wonderful brew."
"Did not live up to the hype for me, but not a bad beer."
"Overall: Despite all the hype....there is definitely a reason with this one. This has got to be my favorite beer...definitely in the top 2 no doubt. Bell's has done a great job here. If not for the ABV...I could drink these all day long. I was lucky enough to procure a case worth of these and will be spacing them out nicely over the next month or so. Even my wife (not a big beer fan) loved this one. Sadly, while I wish this was available year-round...at least there will be Bell's Two-Hearted Ale to fill in the gap. Get this beer if you have not tried it while it is still available."
"One of my all-time favorites and something I have no hesitation recommending to anyone. Phenomenal. Already looking forward to next year's release!"
"D: Goes down so smoothly. No heat. Just about a perfect beer!"
"Thank you MBierz for sending this my way!"
"As for my final comments, I have to first say that Hopslam may be my most disappointing beer since my inception in the world of craft beer. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy it, and will have no problem finishing my two six-packs. However, for a beer that is regarded with near """Holy Grail""" status, I expected something deliciously, and incredibly (kickass) hoppy, but instead got a beer with a dominating booze presence. You know, I may even age a bottle or two. This could develop into something resembling an awesome American-style barley wine."
"Hopslam is a smooth, balanced, citrusey, hoppy perfection of a beer that might just be worth the ridiculous price. I'm not going to go into it's color, mouthfeel, drinkability, lacing etc. 2,000 people have already done that. What I will say is that, in my limited experience drinking IIPAs (I've had Racer X, Founder's Double Trouble, DFH 90, and Stone Ruination to date) this beer leaves all those in the dust. I figure it needs a few dozen more people to give it all 5s to make this one of the six A+ beers on this site. It certainly deserves that distinction."
"Is this even beer or the nectar of gods? i immediately fell in love with this after the initial sip. i want to bath in this stuff. sorry pliny, youve been replaced...."
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange color with a huge white head. Awesome lacing and head retention. Aroma is noticeable even on the pour. The honey stands out along with awesome tropical fruits, mangos. Absolutely wonderful aroma. The honey sweetness begins the flavor profile, followed by those big tropical fruit flavors. Then a second kick of hops, this time of the floral, pine and citrus variety add a bit of bitterness, but a great blend with the honey sweetness to the last half of the beer."
"Drink- I hate to say it but I'm glad I traded for a bottle but I wouldn't pay the money that most people have to pay for this."
"Cheers..."
"Wish I had more of it, had to trade to get one bottle."
"Taste is also very sweet and hoppy. Not killer but still super hoppy and super tasty. This is an amazing beer!"
"Bravo. I'm tempted to say that this is the best DIPA I've ever had. The hop aroma is great, but that can be said for several other great DIPAs. What truly sets this one apart is the smoothness of the flavor and bitterness-it's so refreshing that it almost begs you to drink more. This is a fucking awesome beer."
"d: Traded for this six from halfway across the country, and it is well worth it. A extremely well balanced iipa with just the right hops in just the right places."
"D: Hops and Honey, a match made in heaven. If Belgian will be famous for their big, spicey brown ales... America will be famous for complex hop-potent brews such as this."
"Hopslam is hoppy as hell but still very drinkable maybe even more drinkable than two hearted. Unfortunately for my wallet this beer is definitely worth the high price... The honey is delicious. All around one hell of a good imperial IPA. I will buy again and again and again."
"D: I thoroughly enjoy this beer. Definitely not a session beer, but an ale I enjoy none the less. This beer would pair well with a properly seasoned piece of meat or cold cut sandwich. Sorry vegetarians. I'm sure pastrami tofu would pair well??"
"Well done Bell's! One of the best beers I've had. Feel free to make this one a year around brew."
"D: Even though this is a 10% ABV DIPA, there is virtually no trace of alcohol. The abundance of hops is nicely complimented by the sweetness of the honey and malts. This is an excellent beer, hoppy, but highly drinkable."
"The 10% ABV makes it such that one or two is enough for an evening. But I could drink those one or two every evening if the wallet would allow. It really is a good beer. Sadly, only a six pack for me."
"ABSOLUTE favorite of mine. I wish it was a year rounder!"
"Hype is for the most part justified but for a DIPA I would prefer a Ruinition. I would recommend anyone that hasn't had it to seek it out for the nose alone, Bells nailed it."
"I've enjoyed the flavor of this beer a little more in years past. Seems a little bit more astringent and alcoholic this year, but maybe it's more a result of my palate adjusting to all the fruity Citra IPAs/DIPAs out there these days. Still an outstanding beer with an unbelievable aroma."
"Overall- This is truly amazing beer. Bottom line this creation was crafted by the best in the business and it shows. I cant think of one thing to make an improvement on let alone a flaw. A truly welcome tongue lashing of hops that makes beg for another. It drinks like a hopped up 6% beer when it stands tall at 10%. Flawless in ever sense of the word, just the way i'm sure Larry Bell Intended."
"D: I could easily drink many of these in one sitting but the cost of doing so would put me in the poor house. Dont get me wrong this is a great beer but a little overated. Sad to say the hype may have got to me, i am a little dissappointed."
"It gets a bit too much hype, but still a fantastic brew."
"In complete honesty, if you aren't sure if you're a fan of DIPAs or even IPAs in general, this beer is something I would recommend to all of the fence-sitters. Regardless of the amount of alcohol, both the nose and flavor come together so ridiculously perfectly that you would be hard-pressed to find another beer that might convince you that these two categories are not all that scary."
"All 5's my friends. I was fortunate enough to purchase 12 last year. Drank 6 stored the other 6. The grapefruit on the label threw me off when I first purchased it, but it complements the floral notes of the hops perfectly. The citrus couteracting the sweetness of the honey, balancing the hoppyness. I thought Pliny the Elder was great, but for me, this is in a different dimension."
"overall, very good beer but i was not blown away. would rather have a fresh pliny every time."
"D:very nice. Alcohol doesn't show itself very much, and not overly sweet like many other dipas, fresh, fruity hop flavor overpowers the sweetness. Not extremly bitter either. A nice sipper, but is going down easy for its strength. Not my favorite beer sttyle, but hopslam is near the top of my dipa list."
"D - Crisp, refreshing, juicy body, hardly a hint of alcohol in the taste. At 10% this is a recipe for disaster, but damn is it drinkable. Seriously, this should have a government warning on the label."
"o - definitely more of an ipa fan this time around and this is a fantastic example of an amazing ipa. i don't think i would put this above pliny or even lunch, but it is a hell of a beer. - 4.5"
"Notes: Usually a beer as hyped as Hopslam ends up being overrated. This is not the case here. This beer is all I thought it would be and then some!"
"D- Well, apparently it is 10% ABV. I'm just about finished with my first and my tongue wants more, but my head does not. (I have work in the morning) In other words, """Its extremely delicious, cancel my plans"""."
"Just awesome and truly unique. Dangerously high drinkability, you quickly forget there is 10%, it's completely masked, but after just drinking half, you're already in a tasty delirious buzz."
"At the very end of the beer, we put sour gumballs into the beer which took away a lot of the smell but made it taste slightly better."
"One of the finest beers I've ever tasted."
"An excellent Double IPA. I am not a fan of the style, and I really think that Bell's is a bit overrated. Though this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"Finish: The hop lingers after for quite a bit with some stickyness going on."
"Big thanks to browna71 for the trade."
"D: Despite the slight burn in the after taste i think this bad boy hides its bite really well. Its the first time my GF has said she enjoyed a DIPA"
"D: Pretty dang good beer that you could consume many in one sitting. Gave it a 4.5 because of how i think after a couple the hops and the alcohol might start to ware."
"Save your pennies, $20 bucks for a six-pack. It hurts so good."
"This is my second Hopslam tonite. Drinkability is amazing for a 10 percent ABV. Either my taste buds have evolved, or this is a better batch than the 2009 version. Great job, Bell's."
"D= Very drinkable even though it has a high ABV. I always look forward to this time of year because it's one of my favorite beers."
"D: Very very drinkable, its very hard for me to just drink one of these on one sitting! Not a good choice if you only want one beer in an evening...seriously hard to say no to a second...or third! ;)"
"This beer is radical. Hops and honey punch you right in the chops, then reminds you that you should be on some bright and sunny beach drinking a pina coloda but you stuck in Michigan drinking the best thing that ever touched your lips since your first kiss but even better.Taste like the first rain drops that fell from Heaven. Wish I could drink these all day long. Damn it's good. Love to see MICHIGAN beer kicking arse and taking names. Great job Bell's."
"Ectremely well-balanced and crafted. It doesn`t blow me away and wouldn`t rank in my top 10 for the style, but man, would I love to have this readily available!"
"I have had this in the past but it was a little old, this is a beer to drink fresh. Thanks for the 6 pack Vince."
"The most difficult part about making a huge beer is trying to make it so that someone is going to come back for more. I could only have one of these in a sitting, but maybe the trick with reviewing the drinkability of a high abv beer is that would you revisit this beer in the future if you had the opportunity? Yes, if it was at the bar where I was dining. Would I go to a bar just because they had it on tap? No."
"Poured into a tulip slightly chilled with a golden/honey colored body that had a huge white dense head with great retention and lacing. Smelled like mango and grapefruit, citra hops maybe? Also a good deal of pine and a decent malt bill in the aroma, slight twang of the honey it is brewed with. Taste was immediately resin and pine with citrus fruit cutting through here and there. Sweetness to balance the bitterness from the honey and malts. Surprisingly balanced, but definitely a hop bomb, though not entirely what I expected based on the nose. Slick oily mouthfeel that was coating but not syrupy. Medium to high carbonation. I really enjoyed this, but I think there are other DIPAs I would rather buy."
"O - Well, I can honestly say that this is one of the few beers I've had that have completely lived up to the hype. This is easily shoulder-to-shoulder with Pliny as the pinnacle of DIPAs for me. It's good enough to warrant the price, and I only wish that it was available year-round. I'm happy to be on the east coast again and have this in my fridge, if only for January."
"I love this beer. It's completely worth the hype. Though, it's a tad pricey."
"I have been waiting to try this beer...and worth the wait it was! Local restaurant has this on tap here in teh 'burbs of Chicago is awesome! The beer is slightly cloudy golden with thin head. The aroma was a powerful citrus and pine...everything one would want from an Imperial IPA. The citrus/pine help to balance the 10% ABV....a few of these and one will be slammed!!!! The high alcohol and powerful flavor makes this a tough session beer! Morning after would probably be like having a car deoderizer in your mounth. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"The hopslam poured a beautiful orange-amber-honey color with a small fizzy white head and slow-moving carbonation, enjoying their journey through the liquid ambrosia. The smell was strong citrus hops with an underlying malt presence. And the taste - just like the picture. A bountiful hop nugget body slammed on my tongue which puckered in the delightful combination of bitterness, citrus, and honey. A little bit of floral notes too, and very little noticeable alcohol for 10% ABV. It was smooth sailing, a little bit of alcohol warmth, medium bodied, and very good drinkability for such a high level of alcohol."
"Pours a hazy orangish sunrise with a small white head which fades quickly to some sparse bubbles around the edge. Gobs of grapefruit, citrus, tangerine, pineapple, and honey flowers dominate the nose. So nice. Bitter citrus hoppy flavors really zing the tongue. Oh so dry but fresh, crisp, and clean. A standout for sure. Very well done."
"Drinkability: Until now I did not think I was a big hophead. However, I wonder if my taste is evolving. Very tasty, good, and drinkable stuff. Get it while you can."
"Very hoppy but not sharp and bitey but rather smooth and waxy resin leaves a thick coating on your palate which is amazing! Loads of warming alcohol and honey which rounds out the sweetness very well. Caramel and toffee thick chewy malt, lemon skins and more evergreen tree round out the finish."
"By the end, though, the hoppy/malty goodness began to show signs of building to a fever pitch, not of extra goodness, but of cheap kiddie perfume and animal urine. Thus, it wouldn't be a stretch for me to guess that another bottle wouldn't have pleased. Plus, the 10% which is all but masked throughout, decides to kick in and pickle ya. Liked it all-in-all, though, and I'd try it again. Hopheads love it, I'm sure."
"i think the honey makes this beer different than most of its kind....and gives this beer its special characteristics!"
"Great balance on it. Was afraid of the fact they brewed in honey from the start but they proved its worth. It's sweet, it's hoppy, it's bitter. Tastes like a good IPA and wouldnt expect it to be an imperial. I was expecting to be a fan but this won me over in a hurry. Try it out. Bell's rocked this ale and I hope I can find more of it before it runs out"
"I have to admit, I was turned off by all the BA buzz about this beer. I didn't expect to have any, and I figured I couldn't be missing all that much. Then I was fortunate to find some, but even then I assumed it couldn't live up to the hype. It's not perfect, but it's damn close. I'm glad I bought two bottles."
"The ABV is nearly undetectable in this beer. I feel like I could easily drink a few at a sitting, and only realize what I've done when I try to stand up."
"This is the third year that I've managed to do a HopSlam review. Having reviewed it out of the bottle, from a cask (!) and finally getting to an on-tap review, I'm running out of ways to review it. Maybe next year I'll get a mini-keg."
"After one it's easy to think about another but I think that would ne a waste. Although my glass emptied surprisingly fast"
"Smell is strong and I can detect it before I even bring it to my nose. I definitely detect the honey as well as citrusy grapefruit. Some hop oil is present as well as floral notes. Really intoxicating stuff. "
"Carbonation is mild, there are some bubbles in the mix and they join well with the beating my palate is taking from the hops. Pretty lasting flavor after it's gone. I might not have eaten in a while, but I will be pretty buzzed after one of these. It's an easy one to drink because it's so good, but it will knock you on your ass. "
"D- Surpringly easier to drink than I expected. I believe its a sipper for those not ready for hops, but it delivered what it said it would and therefore gets a high score. I give it extra points for the honey middle."
"Thanks to jbck109 for hooking me up with this highly praised brew!"
"Definitely a top-flight DIPA, and another strong offering from Bell's."
"And its almost too easy to drink for being 10%!"
"Got this beauty in a trade with rhodeska. Poured into a SN tulip glass, with a mostly clear, orange color with a thinnish head and light lacing. The smell was one of strong orange and pineapple with a touch of grapefruit. My first thoughts on tasting were 'sweet' and 'orange', which was followed with a nice balance of bitterness. A moderate to heavy mouthfeel, perhaps because of the sweetness. Fairly drinkable, although it may take me a few to get used to the sweeter than normal taste of most of the brews I enjoy. Definitely a Top 100 brew and glad I was able to finally enjoy it!"
"ADVICE: Don't let this beer warm up to more than 55 deg F."
"Tastes of strong grapefruit, heavy citrus and big time bitterness, little bit of honey to sweeten the deal. Some pine influence as well. I love the difference in flavor and aroma of this beer. It's marvelous. Slight alcohol burn. Excellent beer."
"The taste is so worth waiting through bitter midwestern winters to access. The main difference in the bottled nectar is that the malts are stronger on the palate and mouthfeel is ever-so-slightly lighter, with the hops mildly subdued. Beautiful in any form."
"D - ABV be damned this is scarily drinkable. Thee alcohol is expertly hidden."
"D: overall a great beer. i could drink a lot of these. the alcohol is hidden very well. very smooth. a great DIPA."
"D: For a 10 % abv brew, very well balanced and drinkable. Overall a very nice brew."
"D: Excellent. I had this with wings and pizza, and while it was not a perfect pairing, I would have sooner changed my food order than my beer. Aside from the high APV I would love to down 2-4 in a night. Great stuff!"
"Flavor is great as well. I gave a sample to a friend who isnt into craft much and he said """holy shit. There's like 9 flavors in one sip!""" I'd have to agree. Starts out bursting with hop flavor. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, tropicals. Rounds into a touch of caramel followed by some honey sweetness. Leaves a mildy bitter aftertaste, but doesn't overdo it at all. A touch more carbonation could be nice, but overall this is a great beer. One of my favorites."
"I was skeptical about this beer's ability to live up to the hype. While it's not quite that good, it's definitely an amazing beer. I still don't understand how Bell's took major hops, heavy malts, and honey, and turned it into a crisp, full-bodied, refreshing DIPA. Perfection can't be achieved, but this is close."
"Finally sampled this rare libation. Very good """drinking IPA""". What I call a """designer IPA""". Not a bad thing. Very unique, not as strong/bitter as a Symcoe IPA. It is velvety smooth and has sweetness not common in Double IPA's. Would recommend to hop heads as nothing else taste like it."
"Drinkability: I'm a hop-head and I just got my fix. This is a fantastic beer; it's a shame it's seasonal (and hard to find)."
"I loved the drinkability of this brew. The aroma/flavor of this brew is amazing and has me fishing for more. The down fall is more then two of these brews, would put you out fast at 10.0% ABV. Other then that, its amazing. Good thing a friend is getting me a few more bottles."
"D: This is an all around great IIPA, one that can be drank in session, but damn so good, best to savor. The first time I had this brew it was from a friend who had a year old one in the fridge, so good. Fresh this is an all star beer, should not be pasted up."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Has a very nice finish, slightly bitter and sweet at the same time. You get a hint that it is 10%, but its not a bad thing. The drinkability at this abv is incredible. I feel like I could drink a couple of these."
"D: Damn! Damn! I was dead wrong with this beer! I didn't want to believe the hype that preceded this but the other BA's were absolutely correct. I wish I had more than a 6'er!!"
"D- Stupidly drinkable. I can really understand how people can go through cases so fast. I've heard that some people say they can taste """heat""" in this from the alcohol, and I find the thought of this as boozy to be ridiculous. Perhaps there's a consistency issue. All in all, this is one of the easiest DIPA's to drink I've come across. The balance and smoothness to it all means that it could disappear quite fast. I can understand the hype, but I don't know whether I would go for a drive just to pick this up again. All in all another solid brew from Bell's."
"D: In a packed bar with people lined out the door to get a glass... I managed to snag 3 (and had a Two-Hearted on tap while waiting for the cask to get tapped, just for good measure). It was good."
"Final Comparison: Both Hopslam and Pliny the Elder were decent brews. They both looked fantastic and were enjoyable in their own way. They were very different from each other as well. Hopslam was more balanced with a stronger malt presence, as well as a bigger alcohol punch, while Pliny was a straight up pine bomb. In the end, if I had to choose one, I think I'd chose Pliny, but there are others in the style I'd have first."
"Tried for the first time last night with a friend with similar beer tastes as myself. Figured id buy into all of the so called """hype""" and try it out and im very glad i did! Out of the bottle it is a very clear tan straw color with a full head that slithers down to a thin line that leaves ample lacing down the glass, nothing too outstanding here, very common for this type of beer. This is where it gets exciting, this beer smells phonomenal! Catty whiffs mixed with tropical fruit and fresh cut grass that can be smelled from across the room. Now on to the taste portion of our trip. Fresh cut grapefruit and ripe tropical fruit makes your mouth water for more! Very crisp and refreshing, slight sweetness from the honey is found but malts are pushed back and hops take the stage. 10% is lost in traslation of bitterness, leaving the drinker to sip not because of its boozy nature but because it is so hopped up. Great beer well worth the """hype"""!"
"Drinkability: Very smooth for a D-IPA. Very drinkable."
"Overall- Incredible beer that really captures the flavor and aroma of bright, citrusy, fruity hops. The name is in no way misleading! The only thing misleading about this beer is its drinkability (for a 10% beer)! Its a hard 6 pack price to swallow, but it is damn worth every penny."
"Drinkability: Great DIPA! This beer is Bells poster child and represents the Michigan brewery well."
"D - This is a great, flavorful, easy drinking beer, but I was a little underwhelmed. I was expecting this to be a much more hop-forward beer, but it was a little weak compared to what I was expecting. Still a great beer though."
"Very little carbonation that barely tickles the tongue contributes to a slick sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is definitely present in the taste and its warmth, reminding me to take it slow with this one."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the light level of carbonation works really well. The drinkability is incredible. The alcohol is hidden so well, it makes Hopslam a very dangerous (and very delicious) beer."
"Very drinkable beer but I don't believe one would want to do so to extreme with this high ABV. It goes down smoothly. One would want to just absorb the full aroma of this beer. Bell's did a great job with this one. I hope there is enough for a while before the supply runs out for the year."
"D - the hops and ABV are definitely extreme, but I could easily put done a few of these."
"Though it is on the pricey side its worth the splurge on a 6 pack."
"A great DIPA, and perhaps overhyped. Yet, it is quite good when fresh and well worth searching high and low."
"Just a damn treat, glad I was able to trade for some, and I pray to god that Bell's decides Maine is worthy of distribution."
"The CPJ"
"Mouthfeel was creamy and moderately carbonated, with a strong bitter aftertaste. I can appreciate what they've done in this beer but the massive bitter grapefruit taste and smell just really aren't too appealing to me. I'm glad to have tried this celebrated beer, but would not seek it out again."
"With as much hype as it received and how difficult it was to obtain it i was fully expecting to be let down, but surprise when i really enjoyed it. It's definitely a first class DIPA, however a bit overhyped (due to the ridiculous lack of supply). That being said i will still probably get up early and wait in line next year just to get me a 6-pack."
"D - This is no doubt a highly drinkable beer. If not for the slight alcohol detection one could get in trouble with this one. Exceptional balance and it hides its high abv well. Will trade for this one every year no doubt."
"i really cant say enough about this brew. i used to be a pretty big beer-nerd but other interests have proven to prevail and i've scaled back my obsession somewhat over the past years. that said, hopslam will always be a pedestal beer for me."
"This brew pours a cloudy, sunburnt orange with a fingers worth of head that rolls down the edges with each swirl. The nose brings a tropical hop jungle to your senses. Sweet fruits such as pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot are noted the most. The hop combination is blended so well that I'm now squirming, ready to take my first sip. The taste follows the nose like a shadow. Sweet fruits are awesomely blended together to create a mouthwatering taste that leaves just enough bitter """crisp""" at the end. This brew is very well balanced and has a very well hidden ABV. HopSlam is truly the nectar of the gods!! I wish I could drink it all day long!"
"D - This is one of those that you have to watch. If you plan on having multiple Hopslams in succession, you'll start feeling silly in a hurry. Very drinkable as a DIPA."
"Overall, one of the best DIPAs out there, primarily because it is so balanced - there is a lot to like and little not to like. No wonder people grab this while they can upon its yearly release, and I suspect that if it were made year-round, this would be a go-to DIPA for many BAs."
"Drinkability bumped when enjoyed in the back room before standing up in a friends wedding out of the minikeg. Beer drinkers who were not craft beer drinkers were enjoying it - and we walked out reeking of hops :). Never heard of a dipa going over that well with the bmc crowd, yet still being hoppy and enjoyable with the BA crowd."
"My main complaints are the lack of a real distinguishable hop character. The hops are overly balanced with sweet honey malt and the alcohol could be better contained. A good beer, but not at the top of its class which I am in the minority in saying. To me this would be a malt lover's DIPA of choice. At first I thought I did not have a fresh batch, but after purchasing a different pack from a different store that tasted similar, I ixnayed that idea. Ah well, to each his own."
"Well this is a pretty damn drinkable beer. I really enjoyed it being a hop forward beer and am really glad I got to try it again (I had it two years ago or so and don't remember it at all). Is it worth all the hype? That can only be answered by the individual drinker. For me, I really enjoyed it and would seek it out again next year."
"Not to be missed."
"Taste - Well lets say the name fits. Seriously go slam your pecker in the door it's that hoppy. Grapefruit, piney, sprucey, feel like i'm consuming the forest here. It's a dry bitter end, the hops have nuked my taste buds, quite powerful. I like it and rather encouraged that it comes out once a year. If it was shelved year round it would be boring."
"NOTES: This beer is a sleeper. It does the same thing that Hop Stoopid does to me; makes me want to sit down with a six and go to work. Then, I remember this bad boy is a big 10%."
"The mouthfeel is a little too thick for me, from what I want from an IPA. It is Imperial though, so that's more acceptable. I like it though, if this had a weaker body it'd be a total mess. I guess I'm complaining while not complaining. It's very drinkable, as it should be since I have a case. I knocked it down a little for the price, because it's a lot of money for this beer. Also it's annoying that stores play with the mrsp, ranging it from 16-22. I fortunately got it at the low end, but I have a buddy who paid the high end. Also it's very heavy so you can't drink too many of these in one night. If you do drink one of these, make sure that it's the last or your first of more because when you drink Hopslam your palate becomes Hopslam, all becomes Hopslam."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thick and sticky with moderate carbonation. Very highly drinkable and unique with all the honey. I doubt I could burn through a whole case of this by myself before the hops fade out, but it's nice to have a couple bottles and I'll seek it out again next year."
"D - This could be a dangerous beer for IPA lovers. Very drinkable for a hoppy 10% ABV DIPA."
"As weird as it sounds, the best bottle of Hopslam I've had was a 2009 batch about 9 months after the release. I'll probably drink a few of these fresh and sit on a couple to see if that round, peachy profile will develop again."
"Medium mouth feel. Nice carbonation. Way too drinkable! I could drink all 6 one right after the other. Almost lives up to the hype, which is tremendous. I'm smiling from ear to ear knowing I have 5 more of these."
"Amazing! Great flavor and quite smooth!"
"I've always loved this beer, and this year seems more important than others since it's not as available to me as it used to be. Bell's has it spot on pairing that citrus fruit flavor with honey. Classic combo, and bravo."
"edit: popped a fresh bottle a couple days later - very interesting to notice the difference in the hops profile between the bottle and tap. less creamy from the bottle, increased bitter from the bottle. more balanced and more honey forward from tap."
"Overall and amazing beer and more worthy of hype than many other hyped beers."
"Overall I thought this was one kick ass brew and the best DIPA I have ever had. The flavors were super good and citrusy. Usually I find lots of DIPA's to be overly bitter, but this one was not. This brew did a fantastic job at hiding it's alcohol, but be careful this beer will quickly put you on your ass. Great job Bell's, this beer truly does live up to all the hype. With beers like this, Bells really shows why it is one of the best breweries in the country."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The feel in this beer is hands down my favorite part. It's every bit of medium bodied, with fairly low carbonation. One of the few IPAs/DIPAs that is truly creamy and smooth going down. Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth the hype that surrounds it."
"Drinkability is not the highest for me cause of its high alcohol content and sweetness."
"Definitely deserves the hype. A really great beer."
"D: As previously noted by a myriad of others, this is one dangerously drinkable beer. Full on flavor, remarkably balanced, and one heck of a well crafted beer. I wanted to find faults with this beer given the hype but I've really been pleased through and through. Bell's Hopslam is truly a standard bearer of its style and a damn good one at that."
"I could have roughly 3 of these before I could taste nothing other than hops for the rest of the night, and I'd almost be ok with that."
"The mouthfeel is near-perfect, it's thick enough to say that this is a serious brew, but not too thick like some DIPAs can get. The drinkability is also great, this is probably the most drinkable 10% beer I've had. I can feel myself getting drunker as I drink this, yet it doesn't effect the drinkability at all! How marvelous. A great DIPA from Bell's, these guys know how to use their hops. Get it if you can."
"Is Hopslam worth all of the hype? Probably not, but this is still one of the premier DIPAs in the country and one that I would go great lengths to seek out."
"Got this at the local beer store, and could only get my hands on THREE bottles. Guess it's better than none."
"What can you say, it's Hopslam and it rocks! I've had this many, many times out of the bottle but I do believe that this is first time that I've bothered grabbing some on draft. My only real issue besides the heavy warmth of the feel but that the nose seemed a little hop and alcohol heavy this time around. Still though, if you're looking for a DIPA that offers a little more than just a hoppy fix, this is great beer."
"Notes: A friend of mine described the flavor as being like """fresh, juicy""" hops instead of """boiled, cooked""" hops. I agree 100%. I'm tasting similarities in the Mid-West IPAs and the VT IPAs lately. Loving every juicy sip."
"D: What sets this beer apart, in my mind, is its ridiculous drinkability. Its taste is good, don't get me wrong (I feel it might be just a tad bit overrated). BUT, once I started drinking this, I had a hard time stopping (for whatever reason). My whole 6-pack was gone mere hours after purchase, and I was wishing that I had gone to a store carrying the mini-keg. It has a juice-like draw to it- juice might not be anyone's favorite thing in the world, but it's tasty and refreshing and everyone loves it. Hopslam is the same way... perhaps it could replace juice."
"Hopslam will probably go somewhere in my top 5 of all time. A truly fantastic beer!"
"D: This is as close to perfect as the style can get."
"Final thought: I'm glad this is limited release, because it is so good that it would be bad for my liver and wallet if it were available year-round."
"I don't care what Chuck D said about don't believe the hype. Do believe the Hype! This beer is phenominal! Does Bell's capitilize on Economics 101 which says supply drives demand...Yes! Is this beer worth driving and calling all over town for?...Yes! I really wish Bell's would open up distribution on this one a little."
"Thanks to hopsbeath, again, for being a very generous BA."
"Could go toe-to-toe with Pliny, as has been stated by many. I personally think that is the cause of all the hype, because yeah, it is comparable to Pliny. Hell, I would like to blind taste the two and see what I think. Great beer, would love to see it around more often...at a lower price of course. And would love to have it fresh, on tap."
"Deep gold body, big foaming head (forgot to bleed the keg second time), significant carbonation rising up glass, big lacing. Nose is pretty complex for such a hopbomb, the honey is fairly noticeable in the nose, dryish bready malts, and big citrus with guava tropical aromas. Taste is more hoppy than the aroma, piney up front, honey and bready malts in the middle leading to a sweetish resiny, not bitter, finish. Mouthfeel is medium full, good effervescence in light of funky packaging. I could have drank a lot of this, but, heh, there were about 100 stouts that were calling my name. I see what the buzz is about, I can't imagine a more drinkable DIPA in this ABV range. World class."
"D: The balance in this beers gives it a very high drinkability. The flavors meld together well and leave me wanting more after every sip. I could easily have 2 if not three of these in a sitting, with the only thing limiting the drinkability being the ABV."
"Ridiculously drinkable given the high ABV. As mentioned, a hint of alcohol heat is present on the back end, but other than that, the alcohol is hidden very well. It would be extremely easy to down a few of these without even thinking about it."
"D Good, but with the high alcohol, would be limited to just a few. Alcohol is evident in the taste."
"D: Such a drinkable, amazing beer; God, this is good; the alcohol finally makes an appearance as the beer warms and this one definitely begins to take effect; but man is it a good DIPA; thank you so much Bell's!"
"D - Very high. I look forward to this every year. I just love how balanced this one truly is. I can have a few of these no problem. One of my all time favorites."
"D- Very easy to drink and definitely something I'll seek out annually but not the very best IPA I've had."
"All things considered, it is damn smooth for a 10% ABV beer! I only wish it were more aggressive and ass kicking!"
"This legendary ale pours a crisp clear apple juice light amber topped by a cap of pure white fluffy head that quickly drops to a lacy skim on the edges of the glass. Smells amazing sweet tart citrus all the way. I get oranges, lemons, grapefruit very nice spicy aroma with a hint of booze. The taste is an adventure tart obvious booze in front, intense citrus hops in the middle and a super strong bitter ending that coats the mouth and demands another drink. A very pleasant mouthfeel acts a as a balanced maybe slighty thick but smooth hop delivery system. I could really drink many glasses of this top notch double IPA. I had it last year and thought I could detect some sweet honey last year perhaps this bottle is extra fresh which blocks out everything but the mainstage of hops."
"Good luck finding another bottle. Look behind the bottles at your regular spot. Chances are that people are hiding the bottles that they don't purchase. I have no idea how I would know that, either, but you'll thank me as you gently fold the parachute in preparation of another visit to the bottom of the glass."
"D - Really, really freaking high. Makes me act like a small, non-verbal child making grabby hands -- think Colbert saying """Emmy, please. Turns you into the craft-beer equivalent of Tyrone Biggums. Or _Beer Bad_-Buffy: """Want more... beer. Like beer. Beer...good.""""
"D: For a beer that people are totally nuts for, I think the hype has outdone the quality of the beer. I can't speak for previous vintages, which I hope offer the quality IPA apparently leading to the popularity of the beer. It's the right price point I think, but nonetheless, I think there are much better, more inventive Impy IPA's for the average beer drinker."
"I'm very thankful and respectful of Hopslam and Bell's to note. I'm extremely happy to have been able to experience this beer on more than a few occasions."
"Highly recommend."
"Medium body, lighter carbonation, sticky and dry on the palate. Excessively drinkable for the abv, and possibly one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Amazing hop beat down with soft sweetness and malt at the same time. Thank you Bells."
"This bottle of Hopslam cost me as much as three bottles of Schlitz, and it was worth every penny."
"In terms of the Pliny v. Hopslam debate, I'm probably going to have to pick Pliny. I appreciate the balance Hopslam tries to bring, but for me personally, I really like the pine/hopbomb aspect that Pliny brings to the table. Hopslam is great and I'm happy I have a few sixers, but I'm hoping more bottles are like my first where the alcohol is a bit more tamed."
"It is as good in the minikeg as any style of vessel, just let it warm up a bit."
"D - For a 10% abv content beer, it is amazingly smooth. The high abv does creep up on you by the end of the beer, but it is amazingly smooth and highly drinkable."
"Bell's Hopslam does have a ton of hops, but I wouldn't say it's as overpowering as I expected. Despite the 10% ABV, that isn't overpowering, either. Considering how much is going on, it's amazingly well balanced."
"D - For a 10% ABV this is really something. It's really very drinkable, and I just love how the sweetness from the honey mixes with the hops. Extremely enjoyable, and the incredible balance of all the flavors is what really does it for me. There's so much to back up the hops in this one, which I miss in a lot of other DIPA's."
"Demand is heavy this year so if you haven't already, you'll want to try this. If you're a hophead, you'll probably find yourself with a great mid-winter surprise to look forward to year after year like I do. Do you think I like this ale or what?"
"Great Beer, if you don't have it in your area do everything you can to acquire it."
"From a mini-keg. I drank it when I had a bit of a cold. But alas, it wasn't finished in that sitting. Pours with a lovely billowy head. Bright orange, active carbonation. Chunks of lacing down the glass. Not surprisingly, it looks better here than poured from a bottle. The magnificent smell is there and perhaps even more potent. Fresh and inviting. Green lies underneath throughout and is accompanied by a piney, resinous hop character. A sweetness atop it. Light bready, biscuity scent. Taste is the tongue number that has always been Hopslam. Good balance of bitter and sweet. Bitter is the clear winner but balanced perfectly. Hints of honey do wonders. The finish is dry and tingles the tongue with its bitterness. Somewhat sharp. Before this, a good sticky, resinous sweetness melds with the hops. I could drink it religiously. I only wish to see this beer produced year-round. It has a certain nostalgia to it that doesn't come often enough. And I don't think having it around all the time would hurt my perception of how great it truly is. *crosses fingers*"
"Batch 10101. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pin, and citrus/pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, citrus hop, grapefruit, and sweet alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty excellent brew. Had a great aroma and flavor going on here without doubt. Very well balanced aspects in this one. I can understand why it flys off the shelf nowadays. This is an absolute must try!"
"Drinkability: Quite possibly my favorite seasonal release from the Midwest and definitely my favorite Bell's beer. An absolute pleasure to drink."
"This was a new one for me. I hadn't had a distributed beer from a cask before. The nose had a very fresh floral hop aroma. The color was a nice gold to amber with a slight haze. The taste was mild bitterness huge grapefruit and smooth finish. It is a great lounge/den beer when you have time to just sit back and enjoy the glass. Velvet Grapefruit...."
"If you haven't tried it yet don't give up, there may be another sixer in your local bottleshop... but if there is it will go lightning fast !"
"The gravity pour of the cask yielded a bright amber color with a thin lacy top (you get a much rockier off-white head off a keg or bottle pour). The smell, taste, and drink off the cask are much more subtle off the cask. Off the aroma you get a beautiful citrus and floral bouquet, but honey is much more predominant than out of the keg or bottle. During the taste you get: honey, grapefruits, hop oil, and a slight hint of alcohol. The hop oil increasingly coats the pallet during the drink. The mouthfeel off the cask is creamy and preferable. The finish is dry and slightly earthy. Overall, this is a well celebrated beer that's worth trying in any capacity (cask, keg, or bottle)."
"Poured a clear golden yellow, with a finger and a bit of off-white head, light retention and solid lace. Nose holds a shit-ton of honey, pine and citrus in the forms of orange, tangerine and mango among others. Yowzers, mouth watering indeed. Taste follows suit, with the honey sweetness leading the onslaught, with the citrus involved being similar to that of the nose. Warming feel and great interplay between the strong bitterness and honey sweetness. Great mouthfeel, and if anything, maybe a touch more bitterness would put this over the edge for me. Drinkability should be a 15/5, likely one of the most dangerous beverages I've ever encountered. Lives up to the hype."
"This is a fantastic beer. Out of all the double IPAs that are out there, I must say that this is the one that I look forward to the most. It's extremely well done."
"D: Perfect drinkability. It's waaay too easy to drink this stuff, and if I didn't know it was 10%, I'd be hammered in no time. But I do know it's 10%, and that doesn't change any. This is one beer you can't just drink one of."
"D - I always look forward to this release. Maybe its the hype, but it is fun to see every year. Great DIPA from a great brewery. Excellent stuff Bell's...can't wait for next year!"
"I really like this beer. I traded for a case last year, and plan on trading for at least that much again this year, maybe more! Seek this out and experience hop nirvana!"
""""Its like killing a unicorn.. with a bomb!""" Pineapple Express."
"All in all, this is a great beer. Super hoppy so only try this if you like the hoppy, dry, grapefruit taste. If you like malts, this one may not satisfy, so do not bother. Such a good beer for hop heads!"
"What a great DIPA, my personal favorite that I have tried. I don't think it gets any better when this fresh. Always look forward to this winter release from Bell's and it doesn't disappoint this year (again)!"
"Drinkability: exceptional very high for such a large beer"
"D: Trust me, this is damn fine with little room for error, but it is definitely not worth the hype. I mean, it's a top 10 DIPA, maybe even top 5, but I can think of at least 4 DIPA's that are better, and they are not all from the west coast. Huge thanks to HosP for hooking me up!"
"D- it's a little too drinkable...it can get you in trouble if you don't pace yourself a little bit"
"Pours a slightly cloudy light amber colour with a thin white head that gave way to a subtle lace. Big citrus grapefruit, honey, other citrus fruit, bitter hops and subtle grape skin round out the nose. Hops are front and center on the palate, honey comes in right after that followed by a faint malt presence. This is very complex with every sip and perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, perfect amount of carbonation, medium to full in terms of weight. Very drinkable DIPA, the ABV is not noticeable at all. I could probably finish a 6-pack of this in a night....it would kick my ass, but it drinks that well. Exceptional."
"Overall impression: Fresh and flavorful, but lacking the raw, aggressive nature of a top-notch DIPA. Certainly worth a try, though."
"Get this beer, you won't regret it."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with a thick yellowish white head. Perfection. Smells of grapefruit, orange, piny and grassy hops. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, maybe even some lime, wonderful amounts of piny and grassy hops. Hop heaven. Mouthfeel is medium with a small carbonation. Just right. Drinkability is insanely perfect for a 10% ABV on this guy. I absolutely love this Bell's brew."
"D: way too high. its rare that an ipa gets such a high score, simply because you need a break after a while... i would drink this untill i passed out. and then i would wake up and drink another one."
"I love this beer and all the hype is true!"
"Hopslam is an easy beer to """get"""; huge west coast caliber hops with a full-ish body and a strong (but soft) malt counterpoint. An excellent idea, executed beautifully."
"After hearing all the hype, I expected this to blow me away. It didn't but it is a very good beer. Perhaps not worthy of the hype, but definitely worthy of respect and appreciation."
"D - surprisingly drinkable for a double ipa...tastes like more"
"D- Best beer ever! I love this Bell's brew will buy 2 six packs every year! Great great IPA!"
"D: Very high. Can't tell it's this high ABV, and really captures the glory of hops. Well done."
"Drinkability - with the high abv's of this beer, it is suprisingly smooth. I would easily drink another, and maybe another just to be sure i tasted it right. :)"
"D: Highly drinkable for the amount of hops in this beer. I can easily put down two bottles of this. A great dipa. A great purchases. I love January for this reason."
"(D)- There are great DIPAs out there and this, each and every year when this comes out, it continues to prove itself to be one of the best. Not overly hoppy or overly sweet, but really a happy medium and balance of the two creating something that is just damn right tasty. Everyone has their favorites, preferences, and opinions, but for me, this is the pinnacle of the style."
"One of the few DIPA's that really nails it: it's all about the flavor/aroma hops. The nose hits you with the pungent smell of hops and the taste follows through with more delicious hops. There's none of the heavy malt flavor that makes so many DIPA's more like a barleywine. In past years I've thought the honey made this beer a bit too sweet, but the past couple batches have been perfectly in balanace."
"D-Undescribably drinkable. Flavors are so balanced you could easily drink 2-3 not realizing its 10% abv until the alcohol actually kicks in."
"One of the best beers out there for sure."
"D: This is an excellent brew. I love the hop presence here. The only knock I have is that the malt-sweetness on the finish is more pronounced than I'd like. Overall, a very good brew from Bell's."
"DIPA is my favorite style and this beer lives up to its hype. Big hops up front and through the middle that are tamed in the back with that honey sweetness. What a great beer. One of the more unique DIPA's that I've tried, and also one of the lightest in appearance. A big beer for sure though at 10%, and as the beer warms the booze is more prevalent."
"D- For being high alcohol, very drinkable. This will get you in trouble because the alcohol is deceiving."
"been reading all the hype about this and just had to try it so i called 12 locations and only one had any left, they saved me a case, and it was worth the drive and money."
"Deep orange/amber with thin white head. Strong earthy/pine hop aroma. The taste follows the nose; earthy, grapefruity hops with strong malt backbone. Finish is rather dry and bitter. Aromatic hop aroma/presence lingers in the finish as well. Extremely drinkable as the alcohol is well hidden."
"D: Overall, I love this beer - but who doesn't? It's Bell's, it's a DIPA, it's an American beer fully realized. A delicious beer...but there are better DIPA's. And frankly, standing in line for it is absurd."
"Hopslam is something I now look forward to every year. Was happy to get a glass at the end of last summer to hold me till now. Can't believe we still don't get Bell's in CT =("
"drinkablilty this beer is extremely flavorful and almost every drink reveals a subtle nuance. its an exiting experience, one i look forward to every january."
"D-Very,very scary drinkability."
"Overall: At 10%, this beer is scary drinkable. This is a hop bomb, but the sweetness and malts add a much needed (albeit small) dimension. I usually tend to steer clear of intensely hoppy beers, but this is an exception."
"Thanks again Dave, my brother from another mother!"
"D - Very drinkable such a high ABV."
"The head is big, rocky and sticky. Full on laceterpiece (credit Spider889 for this term). The beer is a clear orange-gold. The smell is apparent right away. Big sweet tropical fruits with pine backing it up. This is massively hoppy smelling but quite sweet on the nose. The taste is pretty in line with the aroma, in that it is hugely hoppy with out all the hoppy bitterness. A medley of tropical fruits; pineapple, tangerine, banana, and coconut. Dry body with a sharp carbonation. Superbly clean finish. One of the beers that I look forward to ever year."
"Feels like I could drink a case in one night. Amazing."
"D- Very easy to drink, sometimes forget that it is actually 10% alcohol"
"This is a review of the 2011 Hopslam (duh).This beer pours a honey orange, very translucent with a light white head that rims the glass. It smells of citrus and pine with a lot of honey. Remembering last year's via the smell made me smile, almost laugh. Oh...Hopslam. I don't know where people are getting pineapple and other random fruits. The flavor is honey upfront followed by an entire pine tree with a pitcher of orange juice. I'm a fan, obviously, but this was WAY BETTER last year. It's well carbonated and goes down smoothly. This beer is very drinkable for the content. It boasts excellent flavor but this was FAR BETTER last year. It's not as powerful or strong or something. I don't know what it is, but it's off."
"Overall the word that describes this from soup to nuts is bright. It looks bright in the glass, it smells and tastes bright, and finishes light and crisp. But somewhere in the middle I lost the hopslam that I have come to expect over the years."
"Damn, this stuff is awesome! A buddy of mine got a case last year and kept bragging about it and I didn't get what the big deal was, but mostly because he's a wanker. I've never seen it for sale and our local store, Beer Run had a limited supply. So, sitting at my miserable soul suckling corporate job at about 4:30, my wonderful wife asks if i saw the last part of the Decemberists live show on NPRs website because they asked Chris Funk what his favorite beer was. That's when it clicked: I forgot to call Beer Run to see if they had got some Hopslam in yesterday! I called. They had about two cases left. So, with $50 gift card in hand (thanks in-laws!) I shutdown my computer and explained to my co-workers, who would never understand, this desperate mission I was on. I showed up to Beer Run with lazer like focus on finding this before the other turdbags did. To my surprise, there were a couple of six packs sitting on top of a case, so I snagged the max I could, which was limited to two per customer. I was to busy chit chatting about how awesome this beer is while the girl rang me up and didn't even notice that it was $20 a six pack. Needless to say, it was well worth it and homeostasis is restored in my bio-dome."
"Wonderfully smooth and drinkable. Has just the right touch of alcohol to help provide a kick to the flavors. It is lightly carbonated. Believe the hype... worth seeking out."
"D: Ok, the smell alone should give this beer an A. The scent is definately the best aspect of this beer, however it excells in every other aspect of the beer. I am amazed that after the smell, the malty sweetness can stand up to the overwhelming bitterness this beer packs. Thank you Bells. Make this a year around selection and I think I would personally keep your brewery in business."
"Awesomeness in a bottle"
"I purchased this limited edition beer from my local party shoppe two days after being delivered. They offered it in mini-kegs, full 24 bottle cases ($63) and sixers. The store permitted mixing a sixer with any variety of singles at a 10% discount, so I popped in two Hopslams and other singles of my favorites. As for the Hopslam, I would have to say the hype is not overdone for this fine beverage as it is truly smoother, cleaner on the palate and so very drinkable over other Double IPAs that I've tried (similar to Pliny the Elder). The beer geek at the store indicated that this year's edition is improved over last year's. This was my first bottle but I must say that it was certainly worth the effort (Thanks for the tip RJHami)."
"D - A nice DIPA. I had this last year when it came out and thought it was awesome, but ever since then I've had a lot more DIPAs and have something to compare this to. Although I really like it, I think I was expecting a lot more. Don't get me wrong, this is a solid DIPA, its just that there might be some other ones out there that I might enjoy better (think Abrasive.) I recommend it to anyone who likes DIPAs, it is worth seeking out. Delicious and smells great!"
"Now I understand the hype on this one; great beer and by the way, kicks the stuffing out of PtE in my opinion and it's not even close."
"D - Wow, I never even got a hint of the abv. The use and execution of the honey to create balance is both unique and performed perfectly. The hops provide an abundance of flavor and while the bitterness is there, it never becomes overwhelming. Absolutely lives up to the hype for me."
"Definitely worth the effort and hassle to obtain. What a great beer!"
"2012 note- not as spectacular this year."
"D - Wow it was amazing and worth every penny (which I kept telling myself in a drunk state) I could never imagine killing off a mini-keg within a few days time because just 5 put me under. Still to date it was one of the most drinkable DIPA's I ever got my hands on. If you can find a sixer for under 20 bucks buy it. It will be worth every penny."
"D: Love this beer! First year I have had it, and thanks to a great trader, I got my hands on this gem. The fresh hop character is amazing. Dry hop aroma in the nose and a great hop/honey balance in the taste make this an amazing beer. I will be seeking this one out next year for sure."
"The appearance is as clear as water but golden. The head is white and doesn't last very long. The smell, oh goodness the smell. It's beautiful. Grapefruit, easily. Also some floral scents that I think are a bit also like honey. A very smooth scent. Speaking of smooth, the taste is incredible. Same as the scents, a bit like oak, too, somehow. It might be the warming feeling. Speaking of that warming feeling, I can't taste much if any alcohol, and this beer makes me feel slightly warm all over. It creeps on me, though, sneaking in, making me take another sip. After several sips, there is that bitey, tongue-scraping feeling, but balanced well with the taste and the rest of the mouthfeel. A bit sticky, like honey, and warms the tongue after a bit. This beer is incredible."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, not overly carbonated. Almost TOO easy to drink for the abv. What a fantastic beer. A must have. It has risen to the top of my personal list as my favorite DIPA. I only wish it was available year round."
"Excellent beer. Forget what the haters say, get you some HopSlam, be happy, this reminds me how good a DIPA can be."
"Pours a just slightly hazy gold with a pillowy head, that you hear as much as you smell as it bubbles and fizzes into your glass. None of the floaters that I associate with most Bell's beers. Tastes of well-balanced hops (not too floral, or on the other hand, earthy), with a sweet honey finish, that backs right up to a bitter hop aftertaste, that is dry enough not to bother. Very good mouthfeel, again, balanced carbonation and its dry enough to mask the high ABV. Frighteningly drinkable."
"Overall, a really nice beer, but there are plenty of other less hyped DIPAs with similar qualities that can be had. Not quite worth the chase in the end."
"Great Job Bell's"
"D: The alcohol is rather evident I know i struggled with a growler of it last year."
"Pours a semi hazy crisp golden with a foamy white head. Nose is huge on grapefruit, pine and citrus hops! Sweetness from the honey comes through too, brilliant. Taste is bitter upfront, a hopbomb of flavour with pine needles piercing the tounge. Citrus and grapefuit, surprisingly smooth in the finish balanced by a wonderful malt profile. Honey is a great addition. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. The smoothness and balance of the hops/malt make Hopslam incredibly drinkable. Not sure I would have too many in a session though based on the ABV and limited supply. Grateful to get to try this amazing beer! One of the tops of it's style for me."
"Quite excited that our local beer bar The Beer Trappe had this on tap. Poured a nice bright orange/amber with a very soft and thick off white head that did not want to go away. Smell oh where to begin hops fruity citrus hops some pineapple and honey with a hint of alchohol. Taste is fantastic sweet upfront with fruity hops and honey followed by a small malt middle with plenty of hops to bite your tongue. Finishes dry and crisp with warming alchohol and a boat load of citrus and cut grass hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a nice body and well balanced carbonation. Drinkability is scary with this beer as it carries a 10 percent abv with it but is so delicious I kept wanting more...and did!"
"d- This is an extremely drinkable beer that ranks at the top of my list with other great craft beers. The 10% will get you in trouble as I am only halfway through one right now and I can already start to feel the ABV a little bit. Smooth, clean flavors, and a complexity from all those hops and grains make this a knockout that will be enjoyed to the last drop."
"Drinkability...Maybe the ABV is a bit of a limit,and the price is rather high,plus there's availability,plus it's a beer best very fresh....but..it's a beer you don't want to quit. Looking at the empty...hurts a little."
"Quite possibly one of the finest beers on the market today."
"So often the uber hoppy dries your mouth before you set the glass down. Not here. After earlier on the day stating that two hearted may become Bells flagship, here now is Hopslam."
"D: This is a beautiful beer, and worthy of the praise heaped upon it by its devotees. Count me as one of them, now!"
"This beer is a snake in the grass. It's that guy who wants to date your daughter and calls you sir, but you know what's on his mind. This beer will smile at you as it is stealing your wallet. This beer lied to me. It told me not to worry about a thing, but that's all just a complex deception, designed to distract me from its nefarious plot to take over the world. Stop HopSlam before it is too late! Stop it before it takes over even this si...<CARRIER LOST, NO CARRIER:0>"
"Best wishes"
"the hype seems mostly justified, don't know if I would say this is absolutely 'better' than Smuttynose Big A and Nebco's Gandhi-Bot, especially since it seems to be a different beast altogether (those two are more west coast styled with chewier mouthfeels and vicious bitter finishes)...but my scores speak for themselves"
"Pours a nice deep golden blond with just the slightest bit of haze. The head is perfectly white with a very sticky, foamy lace that settles relatively quickly into a variable bubbly mass. Aromas and flavors of pineapple, mango, dried apricot, honey, lemon and linden flowers. In the back there is a hint of warm summer, grassy, earthen malt. The bitterness is present, but very balanced with the sweetness of the beer's finish. After warming up a bit the 10% alcohol is very present. Not in a boozy, solvent way, just a 10% way. A very nice showcase of hops. A very unique double IPA."
"Pours an prange copper color with a small head that disappears quickly. Great smell with pine and citrus. Great taste with a definite honey taste and the bitter follow up at the end. A little more bitter than I would like but at 10% it complemented very nicely. This beer is not as smooth to the palate as some others, but at 10% it is still perfectly fine. I could drink this beer very quickly, but more than 2 and you will be out for the count. This beer does live up to the hype it gets, and will deliver the hops in the backend after the sweetness just like it says."
"D: Amazing drinkability. Delicious. Goes down way to fast for being 10%, you would never guess its that high of abv."
"D - Excellent beer, and drinkable. I only wish a little more of the honey was profiled, still great though."
"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: The beer is superbly drinkable. You'd never be able to tell it yields a 10% ABV from its smooth mouthfeel and ease of drinking. While it is very hoppy, it is not overwhelmingly hoppy like some other fresh IPAs or Imperial IPAs, which often renders those beers much less drinkable. In fact, it's not the hoppiest beer I've ever had, but it is certainly very hoppy in its own right. The important thing is that the powerful zest of the hops is balanced extremely well with notes from the malts and honey used. I highly recommend the experience of sharing a minikeg with a few friends, but I also had a bottle the day after this review and it was also great. Obviously."
"Drinkability -- I really do love this beer. While I still prefer Pliny and, even more so, the FFF IIPA's, This ranks up there. However, I must learn to not become too attached as the sixer I purchased will likely be the only one I will see until next year. Thanks, Bell's!"
"Worth the hype and the trip. Glad I have 23 left."
"A well done tasting beer that doesn't taste like a gimmick or a stunt. Well done."
"Drinkabilty - this is a very drinkable beer and considering it is 10% abv makes it more so - This is a DIPA that is wonderfully blended and balanced, the flavors work together and nothing seems out of place - Believe the hype it's that good ."
"It was a real treat to have this. Incredible carbonation, nice one inch head that left my glass nice and sticky with a lot of remnants of the foam. It smells like hummingbird feeder food. Just this sweet nectar mixed with the fruit aisle at the grocery store. Tastes incredibly grapefruity and kind of piney. The honey is not that noticeable but it is there. I feel the other flavors really outshine it. Aftertaste is a subtle bitter slam of hops. Hopslam has an incredibly creamy mouthfeel and it just goes down so smooth. One of the most drinkable high abv beers ever. We each had at least 4 and change and could definitely feel the alcohol but it does not get to be a burden. Mini-keg is the best way to have hopslam ever."
"I must admit that I like dreadnaught on tap more than this however it's much butter than dreadnaught out of the bottle. (maybe I've just never had a freshly bottled Dreadnaught). I'd love to try this beer on tap and will definitely seek this out. It may make me like it more than dreadnaught."
"This is a sipper, but you might enjoy more than one over the course of a long night. But your not going to pound 'em."
"D: As drinkable as possible for the style... dangerously so."
"Overall: I'm really glad I kept this one around for a year to compare. I have been looking forward to this for a while and now know first hand that HopSlam, without question and regardless of storage conditions, is a beverage best served fresh."
"This is a tasty beer and much different (and better) fresh vs. aged. Although there is a hop barrage no doubt, the malts hold their own, and keep this from being as bitter as it could be. For me, that negatively impacts the drinkability and mouthfeel. That having been said, this tastes great and is definitely worth an annual purchase, if only of a couple bottles."
"Wow what a drink. I never thought I would want a beer all the time until that is hopslam. i wish i could fall asleep with it and wake up to it. Even with its high gravity there is no alcohol flavor to it. I want this recipe to brew for myself and never look back so when in the off seasons i can grab me one and feel great again and not just disappointed that i have to stock up on it."
"If you're looking for a pure hop bomb, look no further. Grass, pine and onion launch a sucker punch to your taste buds, with just a bit of honey in the background. A deep, prolonged bitterness (fueled in part by some of the alcohol emerging) finishes with some floral flavors finally surfacing once the initial hop assault fades. There is no hint of discipline or malt backbone which is what diminishes this beer in my eyes. I prefer DIPAs that have complexity on both the hop and malt side of the ledger (such as Dorado, Abrasive and Dreadnaught). I love hops as much as the next guy, and this is well worth a try if you believe in hops uber alles. Just don't expect some of the subtle depth you'll receive in others of the style."
"Batch number 10101, brewed on January 4th, Consumed on January 16th. This is far and away the best DIPA iv'e ever had. I wish I had the palate to describe all the taste sensations and subtleties of this beer but I don't so I won't even try. It is however outstanding. Never was a huge fan of the IPA's but i think maybe this one will get me back in the game. awesome, awesome brew. This puts a new premium on securing some fresh pliny."
"This is an exceptional beer. For my money Bells is one of the premier breweries in America."
"Was concerned the hype wouldn't match the beer but it sure did. Picked up a couple 6-packs and don't see them lasting very long. FIND THIS BEER!"
"Over the course of the year it seems my palate has changed quite a bit. While the appearance and aroma are the same and I enjoy them a lot, I tend to prefer a drier IIPA, and I think the 10%ABV hinders that light, dry mouthfeel. That is not to say that it is thick or heavy, just not as light as I would like. The flavor, while very citrusy and tropical with nice hints of grapefruit and perhaps pineapple, seems a bit dull instead of the sharp, crisp hops I like best. Still a world class beer that I like a lot, just not the same high grade."
"D: There are very few non-ageable beers that I would be will to pay over $20 for. This is one of them. BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
"This is probabaly the most ideal DIPA I've had to date. Highly recommended despite the high pricepoint."
"Drinkability: Well, it's a hopslam allright. That 2nd bloom of hops does slam the senses. This is a beer for sipping, and for me....well, I think it's too much. The alcohol is well hidden so I'm not noticing a buzz due to drinking it too fast, but the hop bitterness wallop makes this one a slow sipper, and the most I could ever have in one sitting is one of these. It's an extreme beer worth trying but I could not have another one again. Well, maybe with the right meal. Still - glad I had it as it's a unique brew."
"Conclusion: Very enjoyable beer not quite what I expected going in."
"Highly recommend."
"Final note- BOOM!"
"MF/D: Viscous body, low carbonation, grapefruit finish"
"This beer pours a nice clear golden orange with a pure white frothy head that doesn't stay around too long to play. The smell is like dipping my head in a plastic bag filled with hops. The piny citrusy aroma is rather pleasant, in fact there is so much hop I can't actually smell the malts in the beer. The taste is most akin to drinking liquefied hops. I've eaten a soak hop whole and aside from the (only slight stronger) extreme bitterness this has the same flavors. I now understand why hop heads the world over love having this fresh. I'm not one of them, but hey it's still pretty good. I tried to get malt out of this and all I got is a more grainy pilsner flavor in the background. I can see how the hops falling out of this would cause problems. It's actually much smoother than I would have guessed for beers of it's style and type. But I have this thing against certain bitternesses. It's a very good beer, but it hasn't opened my world to hops that's for sure."
"And yes, this beer lives up to the hype!"
"Drank from a tulip (duvel) glass"
"Crisp golden apple cider that strangely smells of feline urine and obscene hops. Can taste the 10 per cent and doesn't really work for me, but it is clean, crisp, and puckers the mouth...I love that. I could easily drink 4 in a sitting, but the hype and price are a let down."
" Why don't you just make this all of the time? Pliny is made year-round (I think). Make it happen."
"Thanks Andrewinski1 for giving me a bottle of this super fresh hop bomb! Poured into a tulip. The body is a golden honey color with just a bit of haze and about an inch of fluffy white head that retains pretty well and settles down to a thin layer of foam. This smells perfect. I want a cologne that smells like this. The aroma is kind of citrusy sweet with just a bit of honey in the aroma that blends nicely with grassy, piney, bitter hops. Outstanding dry aroma with just a touch of orange zest to round out the aroma. Really a dry flavor to this, with a sweet honey caramel undertone to the grassy hop flavor. The honey is balanced very nicely, adding only a touch of sweetness to this. Feels pretty good in the mouth, but as the bottle says, this is a tongue bruiser with easy carbonation and big hop flavor. Drinks nicely, I really wish I could get this one around these parts."
"Nice soft carbonation. The drinkability is aided by the reduced astringency (relative to other DIPA's). This might not be my favorite DIPA, but it sure is very very good. I will always choose this when available."
"This has been my all-time favorite for some time. The hype is real! Perfection! I'm not saying it's untouchable, but there's not one thing I'd change about it."
"Picked up a fresh case on 1/13/11. Pours a thick sticky golden hue, very little head even with an aggressive finish to the pour. Smell is....unbelievable. Even on the end table a few feet from my seat I can smell a rich floral aroma of hops, hops, and more hops. Sweet malt balancing it out. Taste is...hops, hops, and more hops. But yet balanced. There is a lot of malty sweetness to this beer, I'm not sure when they add the honey in but it definitely does something to smooth this out more than any other DIPA I have tried. A total hop bomb, but yet balanced, a quandry that I choose to enjoy rather than dwell on. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Feels like it will chew the enamel off your teeth (in a good way). Drinkability is top notch. I'm not a major hop head, but even I could sip this all night long without batting an eye. Truly a work of art. The hype might be excessive, but this is certainly one of the finest beers in the world."
"It would be easy to drink this all night, and I plan to do that in the near future when I buy a mini-keg. Yum, my burps taste good!"
"Nectar of the hop gods. If I were to run a marathon, this is what I'd want to sip at the finish line. Pheidippides would have been wise to do the same."
"Overall, I was blown away by this beer. I'm usually not a huge fan of hoppier beers, but this was amazing. I'll be going back to get a six pack tomorrow."
"Overall- This has got to be the freshest bottle of beer I have ever had, this is a fantastic beer. I used to prefer some other ipa's over this, but I am second guessing that thought."
"Golden amber, transparent, not much head to speak of and some lacing to start off. The smell reminds me of a wet hopped ale. I believe I've heard its dry hopped with simcoe hops. Very citrusy with pineapple and piney notes. Very balanced beer for being so hoppy. I wonder when the honey used to make it was added. Medium mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. The alcohol is so well hidden, its dangerous. I could drink many in one sitting, but I have to play daddy tomorrow, so I'll take it easy for now. How could you not give it an A+?"
"Outstanding beer lived up to the hype."
"I really can't add anything that hasn't been said already, outside of the fact that this is just far too drinkable. I'm going to have to hide the case, and only refrigerate 2 at a time..."
"Thicker bodied then most DIPA's. Very nice and worth a try!"
"Drinkability: This is a very easy DIPA to drink. Bring on the mini-keg!"
"Hands down one of the best IPAs, make that one of the best beers, that I've ever had. I'm glad I got a six-pack of this beauty."
"This is a nice little treat that just arrived at el Bait Shop. It's a light copper color with a white foam that leaves some dense lacing. The aroma is notably hoppy with a touch of citrus. The taste is VERY good. A nice dose of hops with citrus and a touch of apple. The hops are prominent but not overbearing. This goes in the category of strong yet enjoyable. This is one that will please hop heads."
"D - 10% alcohol? what??? You have to search for the alcohol in this beer. You'll feel it before you can taste it. I hope this doesn't sell out fast, I will be back many times in the next couple weeks to get a taste of this sweet nectar."
"Overall: The definitive no-coast IPA and one of the greatest DIPAs in the world, without a doubt. The balance that the folks at bell's have achieved with this beer is proof of their skill. Highly recommended!"
"This is a great DIPA and I was really excited to try it on cask, but I think it performs better out of a fresh bottle or on tap."
"Not something to pound for sure! Great tasting and smelling beer that needs to be enjoyed in moderation. I could probably be convinced to throw 3 or 4 of these back in one sitting, but that would be dumb."
"Notes: Batch 10094, bottled Jan. 04, 2011. Wow this is just what I want from a DIPA. Don't know what else I can add. Such a great hop flavor, it is like drinking a wonderful hop juice elixir. All different kinds of hop flavors all show up. Just the right balance and goes down so easy. Such a joy to drink, if only it were made year round. I also love that the flavor lingers long after the sip is finished. Simply, I love this beer."
"Drinkability (5): This is unbelievably drinkable for a 10% DIPA. There is no apparent alcohol. I could drink this beer and love every second of it all night long. Or at least until I hit the floor (hopslam'd)."
"Once again---is very, very smooth, and you could easily lose track of how many you drank-prob a good thing that I had just bought one to try-haha!"
"10% and you wouldnt think it had more than 4. Insanely drinkable and that is just awesome."
"D: Good stuff."
"I was worried about the hype, but I cannot argue that this is a thoroughly enjoyable beer. It's a shame the price and availability are not more accessible."
"D: The 10% is not even noticable. Beer goes down smooth and easy. One of my alltime favorites and this year doesn't disappoint."
"This beer may have lots of hype surrounding it, but unlike most others, it is totally justified. To say that I would drop out of society and ruin my body to enjoy it everyday would be an understatement."
"EDIT : Had to bump up the drinkability - I've never finished a 10.00 ABV beer so quickly."
"D - Very high. Very much so worth the 17.99 per 6 pack price tag. A delicious beer that is very easy to drink and remarkably smooth for such a palatte wrecker of a beer. I'm becoming sad that this beer only comes around once a year."
"D - Very drinkable despite availability; perhaps not sessional because of ABV; overall a well-balanced treat."
"D - This beer will knock you down if you are not ready for it - can only have about one, overall a crisp, wonderful beer!!!"
"d. astoundingly drinkable for 10%. drinks better than eaything i;ve ever tried to drink. not overexaggerating."
"Had my first ever (year old) Hop Slam just a few nights ago at a BA tasting. It was not aged purposefully, but it too was also very good. The hops were not as bright and sharp, but it was packed full of flavor just like the fresh stuff."
"D - For 10% this is one extremely drinkable brew! Watch out, or that ABV will sneak up on you cuz it's so tasty! As close to perfection that one could hope to achieve within style and overall. Find it, drink it, savor it. Cheers!"
"Wish they offered this all-year long!"
"D- 10%? really? for a lack of better words, this beer is the dankness. can't wait to get my mini keg."
"Pours a lighter than expected golden yellow with two fingers worth of beautiful, fluffy slightly off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Smells are grapefruit, pineapple, floral hops, a little spiciness and a little heaven. Tastes are hops, citrus a touch of pine and a hint of honey. There's some drying going on toward the end followed by a bitter finish. This beer is so balanced for being a huge DIPA, the bitterness is there but it's not so overwhelming that it makes it hard to drink. Mouthfeel is great, it's syrupy but the carbonation makes it seem lighter than it really is. Drinkability is out of this world, I can't even taste the 10% ABV. I love this beer, it's one of my favorites for sure, and the fact that they put it in 6 packs instead of bombers is great."
"I could drink this all night. Will definitely have to get more. This six pack won't last long. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a top notch DIPA. Compares well to Pliny IMHO. I'd have a hard time choosing between the two."
"Certainly one of the best DIPA's out there. This beer is amazing!"
"D: Absolutely love this beer. Everyone is a critic and I enjoy this more than Pliney. Very upset I only bought a six pack. Till next year."
"D: Beyond comprehension for a 10% beer. You can tell the 10% is there, but it never gets in the way of easy drinking."
"Pours out to a golden color hue that has a thick white creamy head that has very good retention, really great lacing and good carbonation. The smell is hops, sweet honey, citrus all well blended together giving a pleasant aroma that makes you want to take a drink. The taste is a nice honey taste followed by some floral hops and in the middle is the citrus tastes of grapefruit,orange and lemon. The ending taste has some hop bitterness and grapefruit aftertaste like many IPA's, but doesn't have the too strong of bitterness land hop aftertaste like Bell's Two Hearted Ale does. I know this is a double IPA and is stronger than a regular IPA, but this is really nicely balanced in taste and even though can taste some alcohol near the end, it isn't too strong to ruin it. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy smooth feel that has a pleasant feel on the lips and a clinging bite to the tongue and how can a beer this good not be easily drinkable? This is by far the best IPA or double IPA I ever had very highly recommended."
"This is the best IIPA bar none. It sets the bar. If only they made it year round. Can't wait to have it on draft. I am buying a case and it is not nearly enough!"
"Drinkability- drinks like a 4 percent ipa... An incredibly drinkable beer!"
"D: I could drink these all night if I could afford it."
"12oz bottle American Double Imperial IPA with date stamp 12-29-10 on the case. Acquired two six-packs from my LBS at $25.99/6-pack (ripoff but wanted my hands on some!). Poured a dark golden/light red amber hue appearance. Leaves very nice lace, although the foam head thins out very quickly. Smells of sweet hops and hints of honey. Very dangerously drinkable and quickly became one of my favortie Imperial IPAs where the sweet malt sits in your mouth rather than leaving a bitter taste off the top of your tongue. I feel like it's a combination of Pliny's smell, but a sweeter pine taste with Dreadnaught's maltiness and mouthfeel. Two thumbs up for this one!"
"drinkability - very drinkable and at 10% the alcohol wasnt prevalent, easy to put down many of these and not realize it until you stand up to relieve yourself"
"D: Very good."
"D - Err, this is 10%? I should watch myself because I'm thinking the six pack will go in a day or two. The only downfall to this beer is price, but compared to many other DIPAs it's a bargain!"
"Drinkablity - For 10% this has amazing drinkablity, my only problem is I can't get it fresh year around."
"Great DIPA. Since this gem was en route to me before new years, I have to assume it is last years batch. Still, it was very complex and the hop profile appears to be holding strong. I will be seeking out a freshy asap!"
"This is a great beer that everyone should try! It has an amazing aromma! Even better when you let it age for some time! I have two bottles ill let go for a few years then go back and try to see if it changes much! Great job Bells keep it up...and make more of it, for longer!"
"D-I had to drink this slowly but hey the taste stays and is enjoyable all the way through"
"Huge grapefruit, tangerine, orange taste. Fairly dry but with a viscous character, probably from the honey. Delicious. Dangerously drinkable even at 10% abv. I had two and was floored. This beer really makes the hops shine. Unbelievable. So floral. I wish it came around more often."
"D - one of the easiest drinking IIPAs you will ever come across. The high alcohol is enitrely masked by great fruit. Drinks a little too easy. This will get you into trouble"
"D - You can feel the ABV after a certain point, and your palate takes a beating, but it really is worth it. Drinkable to a point. It's one of those beers you don't want to go too craxy with or your palate will lose the nuances that make it what it is."
"D- Very, very drinkable for a %10.00 ABV double-IPA. Still tough to drink a few in one sitting. Slow down and enjoy it!"
"Pours a nice golden color that is a bit hazy. Has a Small head that dissipates quickly leaving just a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is hops. Tons of hops and a bit of citrus. Smells great. The taste is very hoppy, and I love it. The hops are very present, there is a little bit of citrus, and then the alcohol comes in a little bit at the finish. I was surprised the alcohol was so masked since its 10%. The mouthfeel was good. This beer had nice carbonation, a medium body, and left a nice lingering bitterness. I could drink these quite often. I really love this beer. Bells did a great job on this one. I hope I find some more very soon. Cheers."
"D- It's got alot of alchol in it so I wouldn't drink it all day long but this by far is my favorite double IPA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"One of my favorite beers of all time! I have had it many times out of the bottle but was lucky enough to have cask recently. Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit all the way throughout the tasting. Sweet and sticky mouthfeel with a sweet honey finish. Hazy orange appearance with a smell of sweet hoppy citrus. Overall an amazing offering from Bells. I will be stocking up come january."
"Draft and bottle on numerous occasions but for this review, draft. Pours a very nice looking amber color with a nice 1 finger white head. Good lace already. Nice floral and citrus rind hop aromas in the nose. Slightly sweet up front mostly I would think from the honey and then there is a strong hop presence on your tongue. Citrus rind, grapefruit and a touch of pine. Nice medium mouthfeel. When fresh this is one of the best IPA's around."
"I wish I could have this on tap. It is very delicious, but like Pliny, out of the tap is way better. What can I say though. Hopslam is good, but I always compare my happiness of Pliny to it and it takes a second every time. I will continue to buy it and love it, but hate the once a year thing"
"This beer is not for the weak of tongue. Intensely hoppy with out being over the top If you are gonna invest in the price of a six pack (near 20 bucks) you had better like hops, but for those of you who do its worth the price. One of many brilliant beers bt Bell's Brewery, pride of Michigan."
"Pours a light amber color with a fluffy very white head. I mostly smell the honey and orange and not so much the hops. Every so smooth feel and the carbonation is great for me. Has a touch of the honey sweetness up front backed with the hops load on the other end. 10 ABV, where? I hardly felt it until afterward, on my breath and in my stomach. Probably the most drinkable brew with this high ABV I've had yet. I loved every bit of this one and I only wish I had it available in my area. Loved it."
"The appearance was the only thing less than exceptional about the beer. My only regret is that their general distribution stops well short of Maine. I would buy a lot of this."
"We've been HopSlammed. There's no going back. The Alström Bros want more. Please send full cases to the address listed on our website. Cheers!"
"Even aged this is a damn drinkable brew. Maybe there should be a second category for rating this more mellow, but not too mellow, version of Hop Slam. Don't be afraid to cellar this one for some time; just expect that the hops will fade and a clover honey taste will start to present."
"Batch 8907. Pours with a huge, fluffy off-white head with tight bubbles. Clear golden body underneath with a few particles. Great lace and retention. Aroma is quite strong and room filling. Pungent with pine, melon and honey. Alcohol and caramel on closer inspection. Dank C-hops. Taste is big and hoppy with orange and citrus bitterness up front and through the mid palate. Finishing with lingering notes of honey, caramel and floral hops. Silky mouthfeel. Really good!"
"Finally got my hands on some of this lovely beer! Pours a clear golden bronze with 2 finger white head. Smell is heavy on the citus hops, with a sweet grapefruit kick. Taste is very similar with a sweet, almost candi sugar like malt and citric backbone. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth as silk going down. Overall an amazing beer and as so many others have said the abv is well hidden!"
"D:Some will say its too strong but I feel its highly drinkable. This beer hides the 10% ABV like a 7% ABV beer."
"I will certainly seek this beer out anytime I can find it!!"
"I love this beer. One of the few 6 packs I seek out every release."
"I had a six pack and managed to keep one for four years in my basement. The difference between a fresh one and an aged one is more than daylight and dark. It was a differnt beer altogether. A- poured with a steady hand it is a medium copper and clear as a bell. S- too many aromas to list. Hops are still present but greatly diminished. Lots of wine and meadlike aromas. Tons of pear and appley esters, a little yeast, malt flavor has been replaced by fruit and honey. T- same as aroma. Lots of honey, pear, apple, a little citris, some tropical fruit, white wine, virtualy no malt, mineraly yeasty, old and vinios. M- thin and wll attenuated with a pleasent med-low carbonation. Tiny champaign bubbles. D- I'd drink it till I die. A beer ment to be consumed fresh that just happens to become liquid magic after a few years rest."
"Appearance is a beautiful golden-orange with very light head when poured. Smell is hops, hops, and more hops, guess that's why they call it Hopslam... Taste is incredible! Very strong hoppy taste, strong bite from the alcohol which subsides after a few sips, but the honey ties it all together. After a few sips, I stopped tasting the intensity of a alcohol and the bitterness and the complexity of the hops and honey flavor really came through. Only downside (or upside in some situations) is the strength of the alcohol, I have to be in the mood for something strong to want it."
"Drinkability: Having this on tap was absolutely mind blowing. The difference between having a fresh batch is remarkable. It is so difficult to enunciate the nuances that really push this beer over the top."
"Hopslam is by far the best IIPA out there; bar none. I'm moving to Dallas and will miss being able to drive to KY to pick this up early in the year. I just hope that Bells distributes into TX sometime soon"
"D- Very easy to drink beer. Very typical IIPA at first, but the sweetness really stands out. Great overall beer."
"I will definitely seek this one out when it is released again. I look forward to a"""fresh""" hopslam in the future..."
"I had it out of the bottle a few times in January and March, but the bottle does not do this beer justice. If you get the chance, do yourself a favor and try it on-tap!"
"The taste. Citrus. A lot of citrus. That, coupled with the amazing malt balance that this beer has makes this very dangerous. The alcohol heat came through a little at the very end, but that didn't stop this from being one of my 5 or 6 favorite beers I have ever had."
"2/26/11 Edit: After going through a fresh six pack, I feel like the beer was a bit past its prime when I initially rated it, but I feel like the beer still suffers from a lack of balance. I tasted a lot of honey rather than melon, but the honey never blends well with the hop character and the malt bill is just not enough to keep this beer from being overly harsh. At one point, I compared this to a Troegs Nugget Nectar, and the difference was remarkable: The NN tastes like a finished product while the Hopslam is still a mess."
"Thanks to Eric and Doug for this one as part of a trade. Clear yellow-orange pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Really huge and bold, floral, perfumy, citrusy nose with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is also huge with the mouth puckering citrus hitting you from start to finish. With that said, it's very well balanced. Really nice resiny, chewy mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the alcohol is completely hidden. This could be dangerous. Expected it to be somewhat subdued since it's out of season, but was pleasantly surprised by how big it still was. Can't imagine what a fresh one would be like. First non West Coast IPA that just blew me away. Totally awesome beer from a top notch brewery."
"*Hopslam is almost 2 different beers between fresh and aged. Fresh is one of the best DIPA's in the world. I myself think an aged Hopslam is still a very delicous beer, but it is definitely a different beer than fresh. Aged Hopslam is a sweet malty delicous beer. Hopslam is so good that I drank 3 cases of it this year*"
"O: Amazing beer. Once a year (if you are lucky enough to pick up a 6 pk.) is just too long to wait for another taste."
"D: Just delish. Amazing. Strong yet simple at the same time."
"Bells Hopslam poured an amber color, with a nice head that dispated rather quickly. It smelt and tasted of alot of hops, and a dash of honey. It waas extremly flavorfull, and full of flavor. Overall an absoultly fantastic beer. If you like hoppy beers, this will be a favorite."
"d- exquisite. fav. ipa to date and it's old! bottled 6 months ago and still delic. can't wait for a fresh one. believe the hype."
"MF/D: a premium hoppy beer that lives up to it's name. tingles throughout the sip and beyond as the hops dwell on the tongue well after the last sip. would happily buy again!"
"dangerously drinkable for a 10% ABV beer, and though this probably wouldn't be considered the freshest bottle, this is nevertheless an amazing beer!"
" Its a shame this beer isn't produced year round. One of the top DIPAs. People say its best fresh but I wouldn't mind drinking this past its prime."
"(served in a tulip)"
"Wonderfully drinkable, I just wish it was on draft in PA more."
"Drinkablility is quite good for a 10% ABV brew, but not great. Overall this is a hoppy and sweet beer, the honey plays a big role in it. I can only imagine what this beer is like fresh, there is plenty of room for more hop aroma."
"D- This beer is a great imperial IPA. Super easy to drink and enjoy."
"Tons of sweet hoppy flavor on the front with a very citrusy finish. I do not want to suck down 26 of these in a night, but I do want to have one every day after work. Excellent beer. I don't like most of Bell's labels, but this one is impeccable. Tough to find, but worth the wait."
"D: this is so sessionable it is scary. i want this all day every day."
"Pours an amber color with some life and a white soapy head. Has an aroma of grapefruit with subtle hints of pine with the honey coming through on the nose. Sweet and spicy up front, malty and bitter on the back end. You can taste the honey. Has a decent carbonation level. I think the honey on the finish puts this off a touch for me. But very good DIPA nonetheless."
"Poured into a RR glass...doesn't seem right, but it's my favorite glass. Beautiful orange/amber color with nice frothy white head. Smells of...I hate to say it...but cat piss...with a bit oh honey. The taste is AMAZING though! Up front sweetness from the honey and such an outstanding balance to this one. Not very bitter at all, as the honey and malts overpower the hops a bit (to make such a unique balance). Not what I'm used to with my typical west coast IPAs. This has a very smooth and chewy mouthfeel with a strong malt/honey taste left along the palate. Amazing beer with incredible drinkability for such high ABV. The alcohol is hidden PERFECTLY in this beer."
"Pours a clear copper, close to a light amber, with a thick frothy head that leaves some minor lacing as it dies away. The nose is grapefruit, mandarin oranges, pine, and lime. This hops-on-steroids smell is echoed in the taste, which showcases citrus, ruby red grapefruits, tart blood oranges, the basic essence of 50/50, and a deep backbone of light caramel and buttery toffee. This seems like the epitome of the DIPA flavor profile. The body is fairly light, with medium carbonation and a crisp finish that leaves the tongue rather moist, refreshed. I can't find much bad to say about this brew...worthy of the hype it receives."
"P.S. : Wishes this beer was available more often"
"D - I absolutely love this beer! Its alot better fresh, so you can really experience the hops. The taste is alot more mellow and balanced, creating a great flavor too. Definitely one of the best Imperial IPA's available."
"If you love double and especially triple IPAs, this IMO is one of the best!"
"A beautiful big, hoppy ale with fantastic balance and depth...great malt mix and obviously hops added at boil, hopback infusion and dry hopping stages. One of a few big US Micro DIPAs with balance, depth of character and drinkability."
"D - Amazingly drinkable, hindered ONLY by the 10% ABV, not that it stops me too much ;) World-class beer."
"Creamy, slightly sticky mouthfeel, nice hop haze on the pour, 10% alcohol! but suprisingly easy to drink for all that. Gone before I knew it."
"I am a big IPA fan and I feel that this is one you have to get your hands on. Obviously, it has a huge amount of hops but it has enough of a citrus note to dull down some of the bitterness and add a bit more complexity to the beer. Perfect porch beer on a summer day."
"Very drinkable DIPA. Just a well crafted beer. Not to sweet, and I really enjoyed the hop profile. This ranks up there, with the best DIPA's for sure. Some of my favorite DIPA's have been around 10% and this is no different."
"This a strong, hoppy beer. The ones I had most recently were 4 months old and some of the initial strong nose of hops was gone, but the bitter was still in it. I love how creamy this beer is. That leads to it's only one drawback. At 10 percent alcohol, it is best not to crack open too many of these all at one sitting. Not that I speak from experience or anything. I'm just sayin'..."
"DB- The price was high but not crazier than many DIPAs out there today. I really like Bell's so far, the malt they use seems to be one of the more memorable ones I can think of. A bit more fruit flavor vs. peel would have been nice but I can't complain too much. Like PtY, the impressive thing here may be the fact that this is 10% and retains a DIPA flavor vs. that of a Barleywine/Strong Ale."
"I recommend seeking this beer out if you have not tried it. You will not be disappointed."
"Drink Pliny young, every year save some of your HopSlam for Memorial Day!"
"-based on the mouthfeel rating alone is what makes this beer so enjoyable"
"I would like to try this one fresh from the brewery one day to see if its any different."
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle. Pours a beautiful light amber orange with a white, one-finger head. Surprise, surprise, the aroma is very hoppy with orange peel and orange blossom, some vanilla, and other white flower aromas. The front of the palate features the orange flavors, and is lightly honeyed. On the mid-palate, the honeyed characteristic continues, but there is also a biscuit flavor. On the back of the palate, the hoppy bitterness kicks in with the orange peel, but it is also quite nice with the vanilla flavor. The beer is full-bodied and coats the entire palate with a long finish. Overall, this is a great IPA. It is super balanced, I can hardly believe that it is ten percent alcohol. It is very hoppy, but even those flavors are perfectly integrated."
"Drinkability - Drinkable and delicious. Give me a night with no where to go and I could get lost in this brew. One of the very best I've had."
"D- I love you man, but one is enough in all but the most extreme conditions."
"Drinkability: Solid. despite the high ABV this is a winner. Great mouthfeel and taste. Too bad this is only out 1 month of the year, but its great. cant wait to try fresh!"
"This obviously isn't fresh but it holds up to still be a very good DIPA."
"14.99 a 6'er = pricey, when you figure you can get PTE, a superior product, for less than $5 a 500ml bottle."
"This precious liquid is only available for a few glorious days in January. As soon as it hits the shelves I buy up as much as I can find/afford, but it's never enough. Larry Bell must be some kind of wizard: Hopslam's amazing balance of hops and honey seems the result of alchemy, and making 10% ABV disappear can only be described as magic. It doesn't get any better than this."
"Bottle from Crown Liquors #6 - Pours a clear, golden/amber with a wispy white head. Aroma is pine and resin with some citrus. Taste is resin, honey, and bready malt sweetness with hints of floral/perfume hops. Mouthfeel is frothy with some oil and warmth."
"Pours golden, clear with nice sized head, and slow carbonation. Smells wonderful. Grapefruit strong presence, sticky, organic aroma fills the nose. Tastes even better than it smells. NICE hoppy bitterness up front, with a touch of sweetness, and a good malt backbone to finish. finishes smooth, bitter, and dry all at once. sticky medium to thick mouthfeel. ABV well masked. highly drinkable. ZING!"
"D: Scary good, I could have drank the six pack and passed out, glad I had friends over to help me overcome that urge by drinking some themselves."
"D/O- Probably could make it to two of these bad boys before having my tastebuds shot. Good stuff. Bought a six pack before DLD for $18, holy cow."
"M/D: Carbonation is great, what an amazing beer. When you have a chance to get this fresh, wow...especially looking at the 10% ABV, balanced and delicious."
"Poured a dark amber color with an active carbonation and rich head. I smelled hops as soon as the beer hit the glass. A very pungent and strong smell, not like many others (perhaps Ruination rivals this). Taste was even to me like a bomb of bitterness. Wow! Hits the pallette with crazy piney and grassy bitterness. Next you gte some sweetness trying to balance to frontal attack of the hops, but it doesn't last long. The hop taste lasts for many, I mean many minutes. Not for the faint of heart, or for those that don't crave this taste and sensation. Mouthfeel was very full and satisfying. Drinkability? Not sure I would drink more than one or two due to the intense flavors, but what an experience."
"D: Very quaffable brew. Loved this one and wish I had more!"
"D/M: I just love this beer; it is my favorite DIPA. Hell, HopSlam is to DIPAs as Family Guy is to cartoons."
"Notes: This beer definitely lived up to its hype. It has a huge amount of hops, but it never feels overpowering because of the balance of the sweetness and malt. They kept it light feeling and it makes it so easy to drink."
"High ABV means you won't be drinking gobs of this ale. But it is certainly one to savor. Another great Bells product."
"this beer gets a lot of talk on this site- and deservedly so. it's a really good DIPA, but probably not my favorite. i'm sure i would like it better if it were distributed to my state and i could taste it a little bit fresher, though.*hint hint *cough *texas* cough*"
"the bitterness comes with a delayed reaction and really makes way for the heat which hangs around between each drink. with each sip you can taste the alcohol. big and bold, I really enjoyed this beer!"
"Overall the muted nose and taste may just be from a beer thats not as fresh as it could be. Would love to try this super fresh sometime! This is a solid beer, though, even if its past its prime and I can see why its so highly regarded."
"ohhh boy, now that is what i call a beer. pours a copper yellow color, that is slightly hazy. lite carbonation with a bit of fluffy white head. the smell and taste of this beer is fantastic. very fruity-hoppy smell and taste that finishes slightly bitter. easliy a top five favorite beer."
"D: Good, I will have it again, but wouldn't have 2 in a row. If it was less boozy I probably would."
"The ale is an auburn orange color with a thick 1 finger head. The head is not too impressive by leaves a bit of lacing in the glass. The aroma is a big, sweet piney hop. The fruity aroma of the hops are big and bold, leaving exciting hints of things to come. The hops leap off the tastebuds like a harvest ale. They are so fresh-tasting and intense that words almost fall short in describing them. The hops are very fruity, with tangerine and apricot flavors and a strong piney presence. The hop bitterness is intense upfront and rarely fades in the mouth. The malts are not meant to stand out here and they don't. They do, however, provide a strong grainy foundation for the hops to shine. This ale is why the good Lord made humulus lupulus. The mouthfeel is unlike most other DIPAs. The hops are do fresh, vibrant and intense that they are delicious from first sip to last."
"After moving back to Michigan and drinking a ton of fresh HopSlam out of the bottle, minikeg and on draft, I had to bump up my score. None of my previous bottles had been less than a couple months old and my """too sweet""" complaint does not apply when this stuff is fresh. Simply an amazing beer, and so drinkable for being a high ABV offering."
"The warming is there and I find the exposed malt/honey profile pretty nice. I'm glad that I've at least gotten to try such a buzzed beer once, but couldn't justify the $16 plus sixer every season."
"Batch # 9471 packaged on 12/21/2009"
"Incidentally, I recently did a side by side with Founders Double Trouble, which I assumed would be Hopslam's equal, but the Hopslam was a clear favorite for me. Helluva beer."
"D: This is a contender for my all time favorite beer I have ever drank, it is for sure my top rated beer here on BA. Would drink this beer all day, every day if it was available year round....and I could afford to."
"Pours a beautiful deep, dark, golden color, with a huge rocky eggshell colored head. Beautiful aromas of mango, citrus (grapefruit, tangerine) and bright, fresh floral hops. Great fresh hop flavors in this one, predominantly grapefruit/pineapple. This one has more citric hop flavor than any beer I remember. Some sweet malt as well, along with mango/papaya, leads to a nice, warming alcoholic finish. I was not actively seeking this one out, although I have never been more surprised (in a good way) by a beer. An absolutely amazing beer."
"d- this was a top notch beer for sure, but i was bracing myself to get slammed and i just wasn't. maybe my hop tolerance has increased, or i'm suffering from lupulin threshold shift.."
"D: I could drink this beer all day."
"Love this. Love this fresh and on tap, it is so worth finding. Well done."
"DA: At 10.0% ABV, this beverage is dangerous. I sampled three during the NCAA hoops championship game, for no other reason than they went down so smooth. Note to self - 2 Hopslam's at a sitting."
"D- Very good representation and easy to drink. Cant drink many given the 10%ABV...."
"D: Pretty much lives up to the hype. It joins the vaunted ranks of DFH 90 Minute, Avery Maharaja and Captain Lawrence IIPA as my favorite examples of my favorite style. Maybe Bell's will relent and start distributing in New York one day. A guy can dream, can't he?"
"suuuper sweet--mostly from hop. too much for some, i imagine. but not me!"
"D: Do I really have to wait until next February to get more fresh Hopslam?"
"D - This doesn't drink like a 10% alcohol beer. I had three one night, and while I certainly felt the affects I never noticed them."
"D-at 3.5 or so months old this seems to have lost its hop punch. Still has some citrus aroma with the hop flavor, but it isn't """a bruiser of an ale.""" Also would like this a bit drier, the beer lingers on the palate too long."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and I found myself wanting another."
"D - For a 10% beer, this drinks wonderfully. I barely noticed the heat, if any. For a pricier beer, however, I will probably only make this an occasional (or seasonal) drink. 4.0"
"D: Far too drinkable for 10% ABV! I find myself taking bigger sips than I really should, particularly for a beer I likely won't be able to drink for another year. The biggest problem I'm having right now is that I want to have another beer tonight, but I can't imagine what I might follow up with. Guess I'll have to take my chances. Maybe Bell's will one day decide to make HopSlam available year-round, but for now I'll have to settle for this belated Christmas present. I might also run down to my local bottle shop to see if they have any left- and if they have any left on the shelf, I'm taking it all with me!"
"D-Very drinkable but potentially dangerous given the ABV, but overall a very nice beer."
"Reviewed from my notes, based on a bottle provided by sigma23 and also split with deltatauhobbit. It has a pretty golden color and a thin, white, bubbly head. The clear body lets me see all sorts of rising and clinging carbonation. It has a big sweet citrus aroma. I taste woodsy hops up front. The hops in the finish are all bitter. There is just a hint of the 10% ABV. It's hard to believe this is a double IPA. The finish is very dry, which is pleasant. The amount of coating is as expected. The body is heavier and carbonation lighter that I thought it would be. All of this makes it so drinkable. I might get knocked over if I have too many, but the alcohol taste will never become a limiting factor, it's just too subtle. The same goes for the bitterness. It's not subtle, but it's never overpowering. The hops are perfectly balanced."
"Rerate on 1/21/10 for 2010 12oz bottle batch 9470. Ppurs clear golden yellow, small white head, fantastic lacing. Aroma is dominated by pineapple with hints of peach, vanilla, and a little raspberry. Definitely the fruitiest non-citrus aroma I've ever smelled from an ipa. Taste is just mild sweetness, then a huge clean bitterness, with a feeling of a bitter tea finish. Good carb with great effervescence and incredibly drinkable for the ABV. Definitely way better fresh."
"This is definitely a big league effort from Bell's and will please the hop head seeking originality over brute force."
" I had it on draft and it poured a clear tangerine yellow. It smelled of grass, hops, citrus and sweet ripe grapefruit. Talk about a nose- I could smell this beer as our server was heading over to our table! It tasted sweet, some honey, citrus, grapefruit and it was definitely bitter. It reminded me of the bitterness off a grapefruit rind. This beer has the most grapefruit bitterness flavor from hops that I have ever tasted. It was quite amazing. I highly recommend this one!"
"Thanks VanillaMike for hooking me up with a bottle. I tried this just a few weeks after trying Pliny the Elder for the first time. I can see why BAs love comparing the two beers, because they are among the top hoppy beers on the market. I can't say I liked one more than the other because they are both superb. The honey in the HopSlam provides a subtle sweetness but does not take away from the citrus and pine notes that one craves in a hopped-up beer. I live in New England, and HopSlam cannot be found any closer than PA, so I am glad I got to try this excellent beer. It went well with some beer brats, onions, and peppers (all cooked in pale ale) by the highly underrated beer chef chowdahead."
"Orange tinted gold color similar to honey of a sort. Thick and frothy head that I would call at least a centimeter thick. It clings to the glass some, but not all that stubbornly. The hops dominates the nose, but there is certainly a sweetness to it as well. Sweet and light, really. Perhaps a bit of honey? Very hoppy attack and flavor, but not really a bitter beer. I guess its consistent with the DIPA style. The finish smoothes out with a little sweetness that I would swear it wildflower honey. The aftertaste allows the punch of the hops to shine. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, which is to be expected for the style. I would say that the flavors are more interesting than they are drinkable. I enjoyed it, but its probably its unique nature that grabs me more than thinking """I need to keep a case of this on hand.""" Not an everyday beer. A special occasion type."
"Overall: A pretty good IPA, worthy of the title HopSlam. If I had one complaint it would be the sweetness. Other then that I look forward to getting my hands on some more soon!"
"SkÅL!"
"Pours a hazy light copper with a thin white head. Lots and Lots of Hops in the aroma. Citrus and Floral with a slight pine undertone. Aroma carries over into the flavor with a nice malty sweetness that almost balances it out. This beer is still a little on the extreme hoppy side for me. Medium mouthfeel with a bitter finish."
"Excellent excellent beer. Definitely lives up to the hype, a beer that I drink at least a case of every time it is released...just as good, if not better on tap however..."
"Final Thought: This makes the top 5 of over 300+ beer reviews, that is saying a lot!"
"Overall, one of the best DIPAs I've had. As far as Hopslam VS Pliny, they are different. This is bready bready and sweet, Id put Hopslam up against DFH 90 min instead. Hopslam wins."
"D - Now one of my favorite beers. Do not have more than two in one sitting do to the high ABV."
"D- Wow...this beer is far too drinkable for a 10% ABV Double IPA. I just keep drinking it...very very pleasant. Interesting for sure, unique, creative, balanced with hops, honey, malt...a couple of these are perfect, but I could probably drink them all night, when the ABV would catch up to me pretty quickly and I would act a fool."
"I am not a fan of hoppy beers, so I have no idea why I thought I would like this. Way too sweet for my tastes, way too hoppy, and the alcohol content just makes it even harder for me to swallow down gulp after gulp. Fine beer, but I won't be spending the money for it again."
"Drinkability is scary for a beer of this gravity, so be careful. The flavor in this beer is powerful! I wish the was a pub nearby that had this on tap so I could drink it often."
"Super dry, almost like a cactus. Fairly drinkable, though."
"This is an outstanding beer from a brewery that has created a superb lineup of beers. For me, this is a pretty strong beer, so I can only drink 1 during a sitting, and I generally look for and buy beers that I can enjoy more of. However, this one definitely will give me something to look forward to during the next bleak dark winter of Chicago!"
"not the best, but this is a GREAT beer. give great divide hercules a try!"
"Overall this is a sweet beer. It's up there in alcohol, but the flavors are balanced very well, and the beer is drinkable (albeit at a slow pace). This is one of the best Imperial IPAs I have had."
"D: Not sessionable, unfortunately. If this thing was 7% ABV and not 10%, I would drink this non-stop... One of these on tap, though, already had given me a nice buzz... By three in I was floating and rearranging my entire livingroom. The """drinkability""" of one of these bad boys minus the limitations of sessionability is phenomenal."
"D -Not only is this beer delicious, it is EXTREMELY drinkable and is worth the price. Just awesome."
"D - The alcohol is only apparent in the feeling you get after drinking a glass. Nevertheless, the tastebuds are pretty well saturated after a bottle. I don't know if i could taste anything if i had another beer after this one."
"I'm looking forward to finishing the growler today. The sun is shining a little and it'll be a nice companion for a nice hoppy beer."
"D - Remarkably drinkable for an IPA. Definitely lived up to the hype."
"D-Great hoppy beer, very drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden so it would have to be a very short session."
"Pretty smooth and sweet fro a hoppy IPA with a high ABV like this. I look forward to Hopslam every January. I was lucky enough to have some on draft in late summer at the Brewpup. It was leftover from a private party batch."
"The drinkability is exceptional for the abv. Drinks like a much lighter beer."
"HopSlam is a very nice combination of flavors. Instantly you notice the extreme hoppy character and then it mellows off into a sweeter honey flavor. I compair all IPA's to Dogfish 90 min, as being from Milton, DE that is the standard. It would be a nice compliment to a 90 min. Slightly hoppier than the 90 min. and a lot sweeter ending. Overall a very drinkable beer, and I enjoyed every drop."
"Overall: This is a VERY good beer. One that I have wanted to try to quite some time and was lucky enough to get my hands on it via trade. I consider Pliny as the standard for all Imperial IPA's and Hopslam more than holds it's own in comparison."
"Hopslam has a strong flavor and aftertaste. There is also no hiding the 10% abv which one can feel on their tongue. This beer is probably best for sipping no more than two, but of course drinkability is all relative."
"This beer is absolutely amazing. It is like a summer day of hard work away from a water hole and the skies began to rain down juicy fruits and sweet nectar! This beer is just dripping with fresh juice of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. One of the most beautiful well rounded beers I have ever tried. Drink it fresh though because whenever it gets a little bit of age on it those hops start to go fast. Drink up and cheers!"
"I cant wait until next year for its re-release. Ill have to make due with the two 12 ouncers sitting in my fridge right now."
"Fresh this beer is just amazing. Every time I have it I like it a bit more. Mind you, I am NOT a hophead."
"Overall, this is a MUST try for hop lovers. It's probably worth a try for those who don't love hops too."
"I still remember how big my eyes got the first time I had this beer. It's been one of those things I only get to try every couple of years because we can't get it in Oregon. Love it."
"Overall, the best beer I've ever had. It's great in every department, especially taste. So well balanced. Everything great you've heard about this beer is true. A++"
"Altogether a very unique and interesting take on the style. Although not exactly to my tastes, I can see why so many enjoy this beer so much."
"A top notch beer. If you've never had it get some, but make sure it is fresh. This beer is amazing, but it fades maybe faster than anything else out there. It is still a good beer after several months, but it isn't world class...when fresh this beer is world class."
"Overall, this beer is my favorite double IPA to date.(Admittedly I'm pretty young) It follows the character of the Two Hearted Ale which is probably my favorite standard American IPA with citrus-hop dominating the smell and taste. Overall, this is an excellent DIPA."
"An absolute MUST for IPA fans, and fans of extremely well-made beer in general."
"Bottle thanks to jprime! Nice clear gold pour with a very thin white head. A long ton of hops, floral hops and pepper, the honey comes out as a kind of coughdrop-like medecine aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma with honey and tons of hops. It is very good, though it might be a little too extreme on hops for me. Stands out of the lot, I'm glad I could try this one Jeff!"
"OVERALL: One of the most drinkable and delicious beers I've had. Hopslam is somehow, intense, smooth, sweet, dry, bitter and delicious all at he same time. As one of my fellow bartenders put it - """it's like they tried to fit two beers into that one bottle and somehow they fit.""""
"This beautiful beer is the best thing that has ever come out of Michigan. The color, taste and smell are what makes this beer one of the best I have ever had. Even though it has a high ABV it is still one of the smoothest beer that you can try. Highly recommend to the amatuer just getting into stronger with more taste beers."
"D: Amazingly, DANGEROUSLY drinkable for a DIPA this strong."
"D - Easy to drink, the high ABV is slightly noticable and will kick your ass if you try too many."
"I had to travel a nice little distance to get it but it was well worth it!"
"I had the opportunity to taste (on FEB 2010) a one year old (2009) Hopslam next to a fresh (2010) Hopslam. And tested in the new Samuel Adams beer snob glasses to boot. Wow. What a difference. The 2009 had been stored dark, cool (cellar) and was VERY GOOD. BUT contrasted with the FRESH Hopslam it was considerably mellower with a smoother body, lower head and was of a flatter carbonation. The fresh Hopslam had a face slapping citrus bouquet and from the first sip it had a sharp and stringent smack of grapefruit right into the aftertaste. Wonderfully enjoyable for hopheads BUT maltbellies would be very disappointed. I think I've finally found a breakfast champagne beer to challenge my current choice of the clean and crisply carbonated Birra Moretti (urp). Here's to Bells!"
"What can i say, this is a very drinkable beer, but I'm finding myself a bit tipsy, so i don't think its very sessionable. Its pretty strong at 10% and its shining through and not hidden as others have mentioned. Event though its strong, it does go down easily and is extremely well balanced. I have one more in my fridge that i cant wait to drink even thought this one is only 3/4 empty. I am accepting offers for trades now."
"A unique take on the DIPA that offers a thoughtful alternative to the whole West Coast/East Coast divide."
"First had this year's version on tap about a month ago at Tyler's in Apex, NC so the appearance rating is from then. That was the first time I've been able to try this beer and I enjoyed it enough that I went on a search for it and was lucky enough to score a couple of cases. I'm halfway through a case and am drinking one out of a bottle as I write this. Smooth with a nice sweet aftertaste. Slight, sweet citrus smell. This is an IPA that I could drink this every day if I could find it. Just great."
"Thanks again Lerxst!"
"D- This was so unbelievably good, but I don't think I could handle anymore than the three I had. But, if you can keep it going, I suggest doing so on into infinity."
"The body is a little thin still. I noticed this with the bottles as well. Crisp carbonation there, but could stand a bit more body maybe? Bitter citrus right off the bat, but melts to a warm honey sweetness. Alcohol is known, but it warms and soothes for sure. Great beer. Loved it both ways."
"Overall, this is a great drinking experience. Sight, smell, and taste combine to make a deliciously drinkable beer."
"Pours a orange-yellow amber with a light white head. The aroma is full of floral and hoppy scents. Taste was actually different from the aroma. It started off sweet, like honey, but then the hops started to kick in as it went down. The alcohol isn't that strong, could barely taste it. Kind of surprising for a 10% ABV. Good thickness and carbonation. Since the alcohol wasn't that strong, I would almost recommend this as an anytime beer. But due to price and the 10% ABV, i'll back down a tiny bit."
"Looks pretty good. Not over whelming at all, but still stands out as a typical IPA. Hazy orange color with a nice thin white head. Exactly what one would expect from a high quality DIPA. Smell and taste is of super citrus hops, but where this one delivers is that taste portion. Not overly bitter, smooth finish with a perfectly sweet aftertaste. I've given this to people who have no interest in IPA's and they like it. Not overwhelming, just a great beer."
"Citrusy, hoppy smell... like a good IPA."
"I enjoy it as much if not more than PtE, and think it deserves a place close to the Top."
"This is a great beer."
"D This is a delicious beer that I cannot have too much of since it is so big with big ABV. 4.0"
"The palate is medium bodied with a relatively high carbonation. As it went on, I felt it was too much. I enjoyed the beer, but it needs more hop aroma and flavor....which isn't a good thing to be saying about a DIPA. I usually prefer aromatic DIPA's, and can care less about bitterness, so this isn't a favorite of mine."
"D: Very drinkable for a super hoppy brew. Flavors come trhough without being overtly bitter."
"Note: I had a pliny the elder followed by a founders double trouble followed by a hopslam so keep in mind what has happened to my palate. I'll have to update this review when I can have this beer alone."
"D: not that high i could drink two and thats about it, the alcohol makes it a sipper ipa and less of a drinker. I like to drink my ipa's I dont find the style conducive to sipping."
"D: Definitely a good DIPA, but I don't agree with the majority that this is an amazing quaff. The flavor lacked the hop bitterness necessary to balance the high level of sweetness. I think perhaps """Grapefruit Slam""" would be a more appropriate name. I would be interested to taste this without any honey added - I bet the flavor would have better balance."
"This beer reminds me of Boulder's Mojo in that it has honey and apricot flavors in addition to the typical grapefruit. Of course it's much higher octane, and the flavors are significantly more intense. Truly Nectar of the Godz!"
"Would I buy more of it? - yes. This is a great beer and satisfies my hop fix just fine."
"D - I was able to finally consume a HopSlam...I found it to be very nice...great citrus flavors with an underlying sweetness...my only problem would be the 10% ABV...but watch out because it's dangerous enjoyable"
"Score:4.9777"
"There is nothing bad to say about this beer. My sister-in-law, who doesn't drink a lot of beer, loves this beer. My wife, who hates the smell of beer, loves the aroma. If I had to drink this every day, I would be OK."
"O- This is a good example of the DIPA style but it needs more flavor and aroma hop character. The backend bitterness of the beer is nicely rounded then it falls flat on its face when the hop flavor steps up. The finish is nice and dry with the hops finishing it off."
"D: This beer is ridiculously drinkable. The ABV is very well hidden, dangerously well hidden. This is extremely well blended, goes down easily, little different take on the style and deliscious!"
"The Hopslam pours a very clear and brilliant orange color with a quick dissolving head and some lacing on the glass. The pour is extremely clear with zero haziness. Aromas are floral, hoppy, citrus grapefruits. Not overpowering but enjoyable. Quaff is dominated with hops and citrus. Some honey is noted on the palate. Some pines come through with the warming of the pour. Not quite the bitter finish that I was expecting but there is a little bit of lip smacking bitterness. Mouthfeel is crispy and medium weight. Solid carbonation. It is well known that this is a very drinkable brew. The flavor profile and aromas are amazing and with very little of the hefty 10% punch it carries can lead to it sneaking up on you. But oh well, thats why we drink this stuff, right?"
"I poured into a pint glass to a small off white head. It is gold and clear. I smell pineapple. I love it. The taste is juniper, pineapple, and booze. This is the best IIPA that I have had. The first one I had I didn't know what to make of it. This is my second time having it this season, and I really like this beer. Three or four of these beers would have me feeling real good!"
"Edit: In my review of Founders Double Trouble last week, I said it wasn't as good as Hopslam. Now that I've reviewed both, though, their scores came out the same. Funny how that happens."
"I had this at the Gerst Haus on tap. In a fishbowl, this left minimal lacing. Typical deep golden color. Floral smell. Taste is somewhat sweet, I'm actually thinking of the fruit taste more than I am noticing the hops. Overall I was relatively unimpressed. This was a good beer, but for what I payed I could have gotten way more buzzed on the Hausbrew!"
"Drinkability is high. 10% be damned..this is great and easy to drink."
"D - I've had this a number of times but never on tap and never for under $5 (are you kidding me?!). So good and dangerously drinkable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: moderate carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel. Somewhere between gulpable and a sipper, I don't think I could do more than a couple pints."
"[D:] Packs a punch if you aren't careful so i'd recommend two at the most. But after one it gets you hooked. Started a little bitter but finished with a sweet aftertaste."
"Drinkability - The ABV is well-hidden here, giving the feeling that you could continue enjoying these one after another. Not sure, my taste buds are pretty much """nuked""" after this and anything more mild would have a hard time being noticed."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I know that there's a lot of hype around this beer, but it lives up to it. If it weren't a limited seasonal the hype wouldn't be so blown up. Plus, I think that it's fun to get excited about beer. Right now, this is definitely my favorite beer."
"My problem with this beer has to do with cost. It costs 20-25 dollars to buy this beer. Worth it, but still not easy to rationalize this purchase. Other than that, amazing."
"and the drinkability is about one or two beers at 10%, I figure if you want to enjoy a beer don't really drink too much of it."
"Came a rich golden yellow, almost honey-like, with little head. The pint though laced nicely. The nose had sweet honey and a strong amount of hop. Upon the first sampling no alcoholic character was evident, although it did show up over time, with a rich sweet malty backbone. Rolled beautifully across the palate, leaving a bitter finish that was subdued due to the sweetness. Excellent body and balance. Worth the buzz."
"D: I wish I could drink this all day. I had two back to back the other week and was already feeling it. Wonderful drink but the alcohol will sneak up on you really fast."
"D: Drink with anything fried, especially fish. If your tartar sauce and malt vinegar are strong enough, this would turn fish and chips into gourmet dinner. Too strong for a session, this one works miraculously as an aperitif, main-course accompaniment, or by itself as a one-off."
"I got this from Dunt in a BIF. It is honey gold in color with a 2 finger white head, lots of lace. The aroma is full of sweet juicy hops, honey, and pine. The taste is sweet pine with some grapefruit up front. The honey lends a very nice sweetness that balances out the hops. Hopslam is medium in body and very smooth, the alcohol is not noticeable. A very tasty DIPA."
"Drinkability: The alcohol content brings this down a notch for me. The taste is fantastic and if it had an ABV of 5%, I would probably give this a 5 in drinkability. However, the high ABV keeps me from drinking fair portions of this beer."
"O: Drinkability is fairly high on this one although I wouldn't recommend it. At $16.99 per six, this one is meant to be enjoyed, not sessioned. It's very good, but it's not the best and the price is a bit of a turn-off, but it's worth it, once. I'm drinking three and cellaring the rest. A very good offering from Bell's."
"Brewed in Comstock. Not Kalamazoo."
"This big beer is an Imperial or a double IPA. It pours a hazy orange with a nice head frothy white head that leave lacing going down the glass, assuming you can drink it slow enough! The nose is full of juicy pineapple and citrusy hops that seem to jump out of the glass at you. A bitter ale for the most part, but somewhat smooth with some lingering sweetness from a decent malt backbone. Leaves you a bit dry and certainly takes the edge off after a hard day! It weighs in at a strong 9.5% abv."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a large snifter. Pours a radiant golden orange/yellow color, like the color of raw honey. Large white head grows and then dies, leaving decent lacing clingy to the glass for dear life. Decent appearance. Initial smell is inviting...hoppy bitterness, citrusy sweetness and pine and citrus hops all dominate. Amazing smell. The taste virtually lives up to the nose. It is super hoppy, nice and bitter and warming. The lack of maltiness is a nice change from some other brews. This beer doesn't need it to balance it out, it is just plain delicious on its own. The grapefruit and citrus reign supreme on my taste buds. Honeydew and honey dance gingerly on my palate. Mmmm. A decent body and well hidden alcohol content make this beer very drinkable. A truly great beer."
"I would definitely need to have this again. Would be great with something spicey - crawfish or chicken wings."
"Overall - A top ten IIPA and worthy of all the praise that comes it's way. Hoppy yet balanced, you never feel like you've overwhelmed. Highly recommended as fresh as possible. I'm glad I bought a case!"
"A: Hop Slam is a deep, dark gold color, there's a hefty mass of thick head and lots of spotty lacing down the side of the glass, significant carbonation is visible in the beer - 4.50, S: Solid punch of citric hop aromas, lots of grapefruit and a bit of pine, there's a thick sweetness on the nose that reminds me of pineapple and cherimoya, a hint of what I perceive as honey - 5.00, T: Pure hops which provides a solid bitterness that is ever so slightly balanced by the malt, alcohol is evident but not oppressive, borders on the edge of a barley wine while still being a double IPA, thick and sweet - 4.50, M: Slightly thick mouth feel - 4.00, D: One of the better double IPAs I've had though the nature of the style often makes it a little less drinkable than some styles, overall a great beer, Bell's has yet to disappoint - 4.00"
"What to say about Hopslam...This is the single finest DIPA I have ever had the pleasure of trying! The first one I had was only 10 days old when I got ahold of it. The nose was insane amounts of citrus, in particular pineapple. The taste; WOW! Sweet floral hops, pineapple, fresh white bread, clean sugars, and very little malt. Minimal lacing but this is a 10% alcohol beer. Get it while its fresh if you can!"
"this beer pours crystal clear golden color with a white head that recedes to a thin layer of white lace. the smell is overwhelmingly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt and earthiness in the back. the taste is really nice with the piney hops and fruitiness up front, the dry bitterness at the end rounds out the flavor really nicely. the light mouthfeel and good co2 make the mouthfeel as good as the rest of the beer, the alcohol is well hidden to the point of disappearing, a very drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a huge bitter hop bite with a dry, honey driven aroma. The taste is great! It's pretty light actually. I think the honey lends the high abv. without the mouthfeel. It's damn hoppy with a nice pale malt flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. I've been waiting years to try it. It definitely didn't disappoint."
"Overall I could pound these a few In a row because their so tasty and not to wrecking on the palate. I will trade for some of this every year probably."
"This beer is very drinkable. Have to remind myself it is 10% ABV. Will try to pick up another sixer before they are gone."
"Overall a wonderful beer from Bell's laced with great hop flavors and a nice honey sweetness."
"D- I'm almost glad (not really) I can only get this beer a few months out of the year. If it was available any longer I would be broke. I don't think twice b4 spending $57.00 on a case of this beer. It must be noted that this beer is extremely dangerous. It is so smooth that I could drink it alll night long. As a matter of fact, I have. I indeed was slammed. This beer just makes me happy! I can be having a bad day and all I have to do is think about the hopslam that is in my fridge...suddenly, life is good. This one is a MUST HAVE."
"If you like beer you have to try this."
"Overall, everyone should make it a point to try this."
"Pours orange gold with some cloudiness. Moderate sized white head displays a nice amount of retention and spotty lacing. Aroma is strongly hoppy with gratuitous grapefruit, orange peel, spicy and floral hops, and an underlying malt sweetness. Tastes hopped up with pine, oranges, lemon, and grapefruit. Spicy hops on the midpalate with a big earthy hops, alcohol, and cookie finish. Medium bodied with a full but not quite prickly amount of carbonation, sticky with flora and earth. Quite a tasty DIPA, though a bit spicy for me, with alcohol and caramel malt standing out a bit too much on the finish to make this one of my favorites."
"Here's more because I was 10 short."
"With that being said, I'll drink this beer as much as I can when it's available."
"D-I really enjoyed this beer even though I am not a hop head. I am on my second."
"D: One of the most famous beers around, and for good reason. Huge aroma and taste, with a perfect mouthfeel. Even with a big ABV, you want to keep drinking. A classic."
"I guess it's time i put in my 2 cents worth. This is far and away the best beer i have had to date. Yes i'm from michigan and no i am not biased. If this beer were from bum f---ed egypt i would still feel the same! Looks great with a beautiful golden hue and light creamy head with medium lacing. Smell is like no other, sweet honey hops yeast? Taste is balanced perfectly between a hopped up dipa and honey- citrus floral combination. Pineapple galore. Very mild aftershock with a minimal clue to it's potent abv. Mouthfeel is smooth, sweet and luxurious. Drinkability is great so long as you don't """slam""" too quickly. My or other's words can't express the quality of this beer so theres really only one thing you can do: Try it for yourself and you be the judge!!"
"To date, the best beer I have ever tasted. This was my first experience with this beer and I am already on my second case. Poured from 12 oz. bottle in to pint glass. Pours a golden with minimal white head. From the first sniff of this beer I was hooked. It seriously smells like freshly cut fruit drizzled with honey. The flavor does not disapoint. It is the perfect belend of bitter and sweet. Bitter hops, citrus, peach, honey... Moderate carbonation, very nice mouthfeel. I am hooked."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a small head with lacing that sticks to the sides like glue. It's an almost bright yellow color with sediments dancing like $2.00 Sea Monkeys. Oddly, this almost smells like a pina colada to me. It was really surprising and really unique. This is an extremely smooth beer. Unlike many IPAs, the bitterness hides underneath the sweetness. Boy, a guy could get use to drinking these. 10% ABV? These will get you in trouble fast. My first one and, in my opinion, a beer that livse up to the hype."
"Really enjoyable in that it's completely unique and wholly consuming, moreso than almost anything else on the market - that makes it highly drinkable, but to a point given that it is so big - two beers is that point."
"D - Definitely going for next year's batch!"
"D - Well balanced hop explosion makes this 10 percent beer extremely drinkable. Alcohol is so well hidden. So glad I have a six pack of this stuff."
"EDIT: I don't know whatever possessed me to give this brew an """A"". Someone should have kicked my ass. After sampling, & sampling, & sampling this again & again, this might be the best IIPA on the planet. Full of aggressive hops, a smell that can be discerned immediately upon popping the top, & the touch of honey that adds that tiny bit of sweetness that keeps it from singeing your taste buds. Perfect."
"Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. I'll keep heading to the pub to try and get my fill before the last keg runs dry. A must-try for anyone who truly loves the hoppy beers."
"So the long and short of it might be, drink this one while it's fresh. Because when it's fresh, it is just too good."
"d - Again this is not for the weak. If you like hoppy beers this is one that you need to try. To me this is a sipping beer that needs to appreciated for it very complex taste. Of course I would love to throw back 3 or 4. : )"
"drunk, goodnight"
"As a boy who grew up in Vermont I thought we had the best beers in America. After all we've got Shed, LT, Magic Hat, Rock Art, The Bobcat, Trout River and many more. But now that I live in Michigan and I am able to sample some of the midwestern scene I am not so sure any more. Bell's HopSlam is my latest and let me say this bevy has it all for me. High alcohol with a taste that keeps me refilling my glass. I won't bore you with the details of my experience last night but I'll just say that if all beers were as classy, consistent, and as well crafted as the HopSlam, the world would be a better place."
"D: Nectar of the gods! Belches reminiscent of the drink. Logical evolution of Two-Hearted Ale. I like it better than competitors I've tasted. Like other posters said it's hard not to drink another tonight.Think I might as well..."
"This feel of this beer is a pleasant medium body. It had some nice carbonation that gave this beer a bit of a zing. It is one of the best beers I have had and I really want to have this year round but I know my pleasure is only limited."
"Is it better than Pliny the Younger? As far as I can remember, very similar to me."
"Hopslam is a serious contender to some of the big-name IPA/DIPA's out there. It shows incredible balance and has an interesting chameleon flavor profile that can highlight any key flavor of the beer on a given sip. Very tasty."
"Aside from the 10%, the oh-so-brief availability most hampers drinkability. Brilliant marketing and economics perhaps (and maybe it relates to the natural hop-growth process), but why is this beer available only in January? Great to start the year, certainly, but what about spring sippers? Summer sloshers? Autumn audibles? Winter...well, we should simply enjoy why we have it--great beer!"
"Pours golden with a large white head. The aroma is fruity, with peaches, mango and oranges. The flavor is fruity as well, with the above fruits as well as grapefruit and some pine. A very complex flavor. Medium bitterness, medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Perfect golden orange brew with a frothy white head that is not quite as prominent (or needed) as some other DIPAs. Aroma is reserved but nice, lots of citrus, tangerine and hop oils. Taste is smooth, unreasonable smooth, no overwhelming alcohol burn or lip-puckering bitterness. This is a very smooth, hoppy beer, almost like a regular IPA, which is good as a lot of IPAs are far too overwhelming. This is a well-crafted brew. Lots or citrus, grapefruit mixing with a leafy hoppiness and honey to produce a very good beer. Finishes with a reserved but fresh bitterness to end the brew perfectly. A rare brew that lives up to the billing."
"D: Can't believe this is 10%, so smooth and incredibly drinkable! Love that I have 5 more of these in the fridge right now!"
"Extremely drinkable, yet so high in alcohol. How much is a pliny, again? Could this one come down in alcohol a little, or have something related yet easier on the liver? Then again, I've never had it aged, so I might have to change my tune. My one real qualm is that I wish I could drink more before passing out. It's not fair."
"Wow, this goes down easy. How in the hell did they make this thing so drinkable."
"D - nicely balanced for a beer with such a high ABV. You never taste the alcohol. really good. enough to send me into DC in search of it"
"Definitely best fresh and well deserving of its status of a top-tier DIPA."
"Overall: I must admit to being a little let down as i had it pegged as more of a hop monster (the name kind of leads you along that way) but it is a very tasty DIPA and worth seeking out. This is one to get fresh for sure."
"This is one of the coolest beers I've had the pleasure to drink. Can't think of anything that taste like it. I mean, it's actually hop juice."
"Picked this up on a trade from SincereNC, your the man. Growing up in the mid-nineties in NorCal I always took for granted the amount of awesome beers available to me and my co-drinkers, (Bear Republic/ Sierra/ Lagunitas/ Russian River)but never really giving the rest of the country any thought about big hoppy, full bodied beers, I was so wrong. Is that bad when I pound a 10%er, because this was so perfectly balanced with the hops and the sweet finish that I was done lickety split. One of the best beers i've had in some time, thanks for screwing up my west coast bias."
"A mellow sweetness hit and is very quickly over taken by an array of hop flavors. Much more herbal than sweet IMO. There is definitely a clover honey kind of taste from both the malt (for the sweetness) and the hops (for the clover/floral flavor). Over all this is a big DIPA that I already know gets better as it warms and the hops begin to flourish more distinctly. Possibly a bit of fruitiness towards the end of the flavor. Mouth feel is full and a little heavy, but certainly not too bad."
"D - Drinks waaay too easily for a 10% beer. I wish I bought more than just that six pack, because I would like to bathe in this stuff."
"Get this one every chance you get... equally good in the bottle as it is on tap..."
"WOW!!!! What a treat! Kind of skeptical about this brew with all the hype surroundig it. Did not let me down in anyway whatsoever. Taste actually exceded what I anticipated, was expecting a """hop bomb""" but this ended up being a very tasty and pleasantly smooth brew! definely and highly recommend trying this brew if you get a chance only downfall is the high dollar pricetag but do yourself and just go for it!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall, I have to agree with the masses that for the style this brew is excellent and I rated it as such. However, I don't feel slammed by hops as much I feel slammed by alcohol and malt. I'm sure Bells threw a lot of hops into the brew kettle for this, but I think they are still having some difficulty overcoming the very sweet malts and high alcohol content. If you're fan of high ABV beers and hops, I have no doubt that you're going to like the Hopslam. But if you like your IPAs to showcase hops, like I do, then I think there are better options out there. For my money, I think Bell's Two Hearted IPA makes a better use of hops and is a better beer, in general, but the brews are different styles, so maybe I shouldn't be making the comparison. Do yourself a favor and try the Hopslam yourself."
"2011 - Wow, much harder to find this year. But got here fast - 10 day old Hopslam. Nose is grapefruit rind and pineapple, resinous, pine tinged, more sweet tropical fruit in the back. Taste: grapefruit and lemon zest, tropical fruit, spicy with a slight spruce character. Sweet, but the body is lightened with the honey addition, some of which comes across at the end of the sip. Bumping drinkability (because the sweetness hasn't started to amp up yet, give it a month and it will)."
"I think that's what sets this beer apart from any other. It's a double IPA but it drinks like a standard IPA. It's unique and I have not had any other beer that compares to it. Amazing and a must drink."
"D: For a 10%, big hopped beer, too good! So delicious and well-balanced that I could enjoy several if I didn't have self-restraint."
"This is one of my new favorites. The abv at 10% is very deceiving, and if I drank 2 of these I would know it. The first smell is very strong of citrus. It is almost a grapefruit juice smell. Taste is awesome. Swallowing it is getting a bitter aftertaste, but as the bottle warms up the bitterness fades. This is what would make it easy to slam yourself if drinking more than 1. One of my new favorite beers. Would pair it with anything salty that I could get my hands on to offset the sweet citrus hopsy taste"
"Cheers."
"Kef"
"Overall- a really good brew. for the hop fans i totally recommend it but the price hurts. to me it doesn't touch founder's double trouble but that's just me."
"D: Excellent beer, the hops really come out and are not over burdened by the malt. High alcohol though so have to be careful on this one"
"This may be one of my favorite beers and I'm thrilled that we can get it in GA now...while it lasts, anyway. I will update when I do a head-to-head with Dogfishhead 90 minute..may mix in a taste of pliney the elder (if I can procure it) for good measure."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Batch #9552 according to Bells website it was bottled on Jan 18,2010. Poured into a snifter. About 2 inches of foamy head. Strong grapefuit like smell with some sweet aroma. Deep copper color. The flavor is outstanding. Strong sweet honey, hoppy flavor is very intense. Hops profile is more grapefruit than pine. Mouthfeel is very smooth and highly drinkable."
"I feel like this beer gets a lot of its reputation from its warming character. The kick-- likely a result of the honey added during brewing-- is nice and smooth, but it doesn't do much for the flavors of this beer. Good stuff, if over-hyped. Didn't really slam me."
"Salud!"
"I tried this beer last year but i remember it being slightly better, maybe I'm imagining things. still not bad though."
"Maybe not quite up to the hype, but close enough and a very good beer. This bottle was from a sixer purchase almost two months ago and it has already mellowed. The fresh stuff was even more of a """HopSlam"""."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a pure clear golden color. About a finger of white head that leaves some excellent lacing on the sides of the glass. It has an incredible clean floral hop aroma with hints of citrus. One of the best noses I have encountered on a beer. The hops are definitely present on the front of the sip. They match the floral notes in the aroma. It is surprisingly smooth. I expected much more bitterness. This is probably the least bitter double IPA I have ever had. The hops are still there just not so abrupt. I am not sure if the honey is responsible for the subdued bitterness or not. The honey is noted in some sweetness at the tail end of the taste and probably adds to the oily mouthfeel along with the hops. This is very smooth and the alcohol is masked making the alcohol content seem to be in the 6%-7% range. Overall and excellent beer. One of the best DIPA I have experienced. Although an excellent beer, I was disappointed slightly. I think the hype raised my expectations too high."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but it is very thick making it slightly difficult to go for more than a few at a time. The wonderful flavor makes you want to go back for more every time."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, an excellent DIPA. Interesting flavor profile that is held together quite well despite the level of hop bitterness. Thus far, this is my third favorite DIPA after The Oracle (1st) and Pliny the Elder (2nd). Well worth a try."
"Overall this beer was fantastic. A must try for fans of IPAs. Not only will I try this beer again I plan on grabbing a 6 pack the next chance I get."
"The honey addition really provides a silky smooth mouthfeel which kind of clashes with the high carbonation. I think a lower carbonation would compliment the smoothness and increase drinkability. Overall I enjoyed it in the bottle but loved it on tap."
"After recently having Founders Double Trouble, I think this has more in common with Three Floyds Dreadnaught. Comparing the two, Dreadnaught is vastly superior. It is much more complex and is akin to having a tropical fruit hop explosion in your mouth. This is a little too heavy on grapefruit, and the bready malts come through a little more than you might expect. Very good IPA, just not worthy of the hype, or price."
"D: Good for sure, but the hops are a little more aggressive than I would like. Then again, I am not a hop head. This is a new style that I am really starting to enjoy, and unfortunately this is not my favorite take on the style. For the price, and all the hype I think I would rather have a DFH 90Min. (and yet I rated 90Min. lower.. odd isn't it?)"
"Pours crystal clear with a light copper and orange color crowned with a thick two finger, white head. The visibly high carbonation emits a big and bold aroma of citrus hops with warming floral notes. The body is mild and mouth filling with a touch of malt sweetness to complement the big hop citrus flavors. Very fresh and fruity as well as very well balanced. Completely covers any hint of the 10% abv with great flavor. The finish is very gentle and ends just a touch vinous."
"This beer has a beautiful snow white head on a clear orange body. The aroma explodes with grapefruit and lemon and tropical fruit. This beer has a ton of IBUs, but that's not even the point. The flavor is a wonderful melding of grapefruit and canteloupe fresh hop flavors, with enough warm caramely malt to make it work, and a long bitter finish. This beer is awesome!"
"EDIT: Had to adjust the """Overall""" score, as when I first reviewed it I didn't equate """Drinkability""" with """Overall.""" This is an overall amazing beer."
"Ok the first beer went down surprising very smooth. I tasted the honey as it rolled over my tongue then it moved to the normal IPA - grapefruit, piney but disappeared fast as if I was dehydrated. I wanted more... Alc% is a creeper because it is very easy to drink. Probably the best IPA I have had so far. I can't believe how light it is. First review but worth every letter and taste. Try it!"
"This brew was beer bliss when I had it for the first time from the bottle. It's even better on tap. Amazing beer."
"This one pours a light orange color with a quarter inch white head, leaving light lacing. Smells of hops, tastes of hops, specifically a big dose of grapefruit with a tangy aftertaste. Excellent IPA flavor, but a bit light on the mouthfeel for a DIPA. Very drinkable, and I don't notice the ABV that much, but the overall impression is that of an IPA."
"This is one heck of a drinkable double IPA. It is powerful, for sure, but it drinks like a nice West Coast-style IPA. At temperatures below 45 degrees, this would undoubtedly be a dangerous fellow. A few of these could go down easily, and put you down with just as much ease. Be weary, or be ready for a HopSlam to the face."
"Nice carbonation. I like that it is not as thick as some DIPA brews making it very drinkable."
"Great lacing down the glass, actually had to break out a second bottle tonight it was so amazing. I'm going to have to figure out how to score a 3rd case from Shangy's..."
"Carbonation is good, and the thickness is right for this IIPA. Immensely drinkable. Even with the strength and boldness of Hopslam, I could easily put a few down, more so than most 'regular' brews."
"Glad I finally got to try this one. It really is an excellent DIPA."
"Medium to full bodied and quite firm, but somehow drinks like it's light and soft. Oily and sticky, facilitating the unending finish. Is this beer really 10%? Quite possibly the most drinkable double IPA in production."
"Pours from the bottle with a sparkling, crystal, orange-copper color, and a sticky, bubbly, cream-colored head. The combination of honey and hop aroma smacks me in the face from the second I open the bottle, like if one of those plastic bears from the grocery store came to life, climbed a pine tree, walked through a field of wildflowers, and then started mauling my sinuses with his sticky, sweet, sap-covered paws. Although the aroma is packed with both the honey sweetness and the piney and floral hops, the flavor is much more hop-forward, showcasing the resinous pine and a bit of orange, and with the honey providing a sweet balance. And the flavor and aroma from the honey is wonderfully natural, rather than an artificial, syrupy sweetness. The potency of the flavors deftly masks the 10% alcohol, and although the label claims that this is """a biting, bitter, tongue bruiser", this one is remarkably drinkable. With both a little sweetness and some bitterness lingering on my tongue, and feeling warm on the inside right now, I am certainly content with this year's edition."
"it didn't matter in a way i still wanted this stuff and couldn't wait to get it.. my man seplo from here moved away and sent some to me and smutty33.. neither of us is impressed. don't know if our palates changed or what.. it's not horrible... but i'm doin backflips.. to sweet.. where's the big hops?"
"D: this is a strong contender in the DIPA category and a very enjoyable beer. If this was easily accessible to me, it would be a regular in the fridge. As it is, I'll trade for this once or twice a year, but wouldn't consider this an A+ beer."
"Drinkability: Who cares about the 10% ABV?! I say the drinkability on Bell's Hopslam is way better than par. In other words, this is one you can sit and sip and enjoy all night long. At $18 for a six pack it might get a bit expensive but heck, You only get to do it once a year right?"
"overall another beer i look forward too each year...the price deters me from purchasing more of this...the dipa imo next to pte"
"Drink it as soon as its released. It starts to change after a month!!! (i've experimented)."
"Wow, another great beer from Bell's. I've yet to have anything from them that disappoints. As a midwesterner, I don't know of another brewery that comes close to their overall consistently great beers (maybe Founder's). I was lucky to grab the last six pack of this at the liquor store I frequent and I hope to find it again."
"This is one beer that always sneaks up on me. It's so flavorful and appealing I tend to forget the punch it packs."
"Taste is very good - there is largely a huge pineapple flavor with a large pine presence and a decent malt body . I never would have known it was a 10% abv had I not seen it in the description, and based on that, I had to give it a pretty decent drinkability score. Good brew, not surprising this has a huge following and it is readily available / able to sell out."
"After all the hype, HopSlam measures up well, although not a grand slam for me. A bit too astringent and lacking in malt character, although I realize that's what it's all about. Occasionally suggests toothpaste, which is refreshing, but not exactly something I want to sip on."
"D-definately a sipper if the high abv isnt enough of a deterent the hop profile certanly is it a great beer but one that probably can't be enjoyed throughout the night"
"Impression: Lotta hype, this one walks the walk. If you are a lover of this style, do what it takes, get some of this."
"Drinkability - Let's just say that it is a good thing these are not available around me. If I had this, The Oracle, and Pliny the Elder all available all the time by me, I would probably never drink anything different. All three are very different in my opinion, yet all three represent the style extremely well. Hopslam is a very balanced beer. I would say The Oracle is a bit of a sweeter DIPA, Hopslam well balanced, and PtE a bit on the bitter side. I feel like I could have one or two of either The Oracle or PtE and then perhaps move on to something else because the style was a bit too sweet or bitter. But with Hopslam, with the nice notes of citrus and pine/hops then balanced by a slight malty backbone which finishes up with a taste of honey...I could session these until I passed out. Better than I was expecting and I fear from now on I will have to bug kzoobrew every year to send me out a few of these!"
"D: Man oh man. In terms of the mouthfeel and the taste, this beer is extremely drinkable. Yet, the alcohol (10% abv) is skillfully inconspicuous. After two I am filling toasty, and I have a hefty tolerance. Drinking six is easy, but don't stand up too quickly. Be careful, this one's a creeper."
"aromatics are insaine!! Smell of fresh grapefruit and fresh zested orange peel. It just smells fresh!! Poured into smuttynose tulip, beutifull white head with proper lacing. Aromatics explode in glass. Initial taste is almost tart candy, then as my pallet falls back down to earth I am quickly reminded that's an ipa in there. Buttering is perfect in the finish. Again higy recommended and the fresher the better!!"
"(D) Drinakbility - Extremely drinkable for a DIPA. Alcohol taste is almost non-existent."
"Notes: It's not half as assertive or spectacular as the hype would have one believe. But it is a pretty tasty and delicate hoppy brew nevertheless. And even if a tad overpriced, it is rather nice to have around, and remains very recommendable."
"Can this really be a double IPA? This is a highly drinkable beer. Absoutely love the flavor. Hop flavor followed by citrus and balanced by a smooth malt backbone. This beer is deceptive. You'd never know it had such a high alcohol content. Too much to be a session beer, but boy I'd sure like to try. Oh, by the way, also had a nice creamy head on top of a clear amber orange body."
"This is a supremely drinkable ale for a 10% hop bomb, greatly enjoying it, really enjoy the hop flavors it leaves behind in the mouth."
"I've got a few other DIPAs to explore and I may come back and revise the ratings based on my experiences with this style."
"Was lucky enough to find 6 scattered bottles of this at Abe's Six Pack in PA last year. Pours a cloudy orange color with a thin white head. Smell- oh my, huge grapefruit/pineapple smell WOW, unlike any DIPA I have ever smelt. Some hints of carmael and you can smell the hops too I think! Taste - MMMM hopssss, sweet carmel also to keep the hops in check. Great body, for the ABV and style, creamy, some alcohol comes through. What an awesome beer overall, I am not worthy."
"Overall, I was glad I got to try this on tap, it was delicious. I think its more syrupy and not as full bodied as it is out of the bottle giving it a slight edge in drinkability. I highly recommend seeking this out on tap."
"Drinkability-10%? Really? Excuse me while i drink six and pass out"
"D - wasnt sure about this, but before i knew it i was cracking another. quite drinkable for the abv although the alcohol is definitely there. a damn fine DIPA, near the top for me."
"O: As an experiment, I fed HopSlam to my friend that normally *doesn't drink any kind of beer*. As I expected, the intensity of the hop bitterness of HopSlam gave a priceless facial expression. My recommendations for this brew are simple: if DIPAs are your thing, you need to pick up some HopSlam NOW. If you dislike DIPAs, don't pick up HopSlam."
"Overall I didn't think Hopslam lost a step over last year's. The honey adds a bit more body however the sweetness detracts from the drinkability by just a tad. Still, this is worth seeking out."
"D: Again, drinkable, not something I would pass up, but not something I'm going to get as excited about in the future. But people who haven't had it really must."
"Loved this beer! Poured into a pint glass and immediately noticed the perfect head, 3 fingers thick with a nice puffy lacing and the color was a brilliant golden orange. Holy cow the hops on this beer! Almost overwhelmingly aromatic. My wife could smell it all the way in the next room! Bursting with a bright citrus pop, the smell is incredibly bright and cheery, like wind blowing over an orange tree. The carbonation is perfectly balanced, mixing well with the bright, white grapefruit taste that seems to almost float in your mouth. The finish has a slight bitterness to it not unlike that of citrus zest. Though this beer is INCREDIBLY drinkable, watch out because the 10% ABV will knock you on your ass if you're not careful. This would be a perfect beer to enjoy on your deck in the summertime, and it may very well be my favorite offering from Bell's at this point. Can't wait for another bottle!"
"Very drinkable...refreshing...wonderful!"
"The pale bronze colored body was very clear, and the head was small, which I'm sure was due to the alcoholic strength. The smell was a seductive mix of grapefruit, pine resin, and more grapefruit. The taste was very citric and juicy to the core, almost hard candy like in its sweetness until smacking you down with a spicy hop finish. The bitterness was quite low, but otherwise hops drove the show. Sticky texture and long spicy aftertaste made this an enjoyable beer, which was surprisingly approachable despite the double digit ABV. Bravo."
"Overall, this is the first brew I've had from Bell's and it is phenomenal. Without a doubt, the best DIPA I have ever had. Sticky, hoppy, citrusy with a very smooth body. Everyone should try this beer."
"I wish Bell's were within my reach. If it were, I'd be out buying more of this brew instead of sitting here writing this up."
"Overall an excellent DIPA, my new favorite of the style. Drinkability ranks pretty high for DIPAs in my opinion, as I will crack another b/c it's delicious, but the 10% ABV is gonna stop me after a second."
"D: Oh how I wish the beer was local. Easily one of the best, if not the best, DIPA's that I have had. I could drink a few of these in a sitting and be just fine, although I'd imagine my palate might get a little burnt after that"
"D - There is a reason this beer inspires shelf-clearing lunacy."
"Had this side by side with Pliny the Elder. A perfect example of how something is """different," and not necessarily """better.""" There's definitely room in my life for both!"
"D: Big knock here for the overabundance of booze. I know its a DIPA but there was no effort taken to mask the harsh alcohol heat. Its too unapologetic and obviously at this level drinkability suffers."
"D - The boozy aftertaste is the major thing that brings this score down, but I could drink a few of these, and then take a nap. It is a pretty good brew. Not quite to Sculpin or Pliny the Elder levels, but it's the closest I've seen for any midwest or east coast based DIPAs."
"D - Every time I drink this beer, I think..."""there is no way this is a 10% beer"""...and I still say that. This is just such a full flavored, citrusy, hoppy beer - and combined with the thin body, just goes down so fast and easy. Feels like a regular IPA...never had many of these back to back, or I might change my opinion, but this just might be the easiest drinking high alcohol beer I've ever had. Definitely dangerously drinkable."
"Only the ABV takes away from the drinkability of this delicious brew. (not to mention the 18 dollar pricetag.)"
"Thanks again to ericwo for sending me this. Poured a nice golden honey color into the glass with a nice white two finger head that slowly dissipated leaving lacing all the way down the glass.The nose is citrus, hoppy and honey. There is a faint smell in the nose that is a little reminiscent of cheese. The taste is solid. Delicious citrus hops that open up more with each sip. Hints of honey, grapefruit, pine and hop resin come through early. There's a bit of bite in the initial taste that is smoothed over by honey in the finish. The beer rolls over your tongue and kind of coats your mouth. The honey really balances this out and keeps the hops in check, making it very, very drinkable. I wish they made this year round, this would be the perfect beer to have on hand in your fridge at all times."
"All-in-all, it's fantastic. I wish Bell's offered it year-round. But, at $18+/6-pack, I doubt I could drink it every weekend. There are lots of great beers available in Alabama now, but this one is exceptional."
"Mouthfeel is medium full and smooth with a crisp finish."
"The drinkability is terrific. Especially when considered how strong the hops are, it's impressive that the beer is such a pleasurable experience and in no way a laboring one."
"Notes: Tastes like Bell's Two Hearted Ale with the bitterness and aroma of grapefruit added. Love it."
"Very nicely done for the style, just not one that appeals to me. I've heard hops is an acquired taste, and if so, this one would take a decade to get used to."
"Overall on tap I could keep drinkin em as long as they would keep servin em. Hopslam is great in the bottle but it opens up so much more on tap and anyone who can get a chance to try it most definitely should."
"Living on the west coast, I don't have regular access to this. However, I have a kind buddy (squaremile) who picks me up a bottle or two during his travels over to the great lakes. I always look forward to the delight and novelty this beer brings to me."
"At $15.99 a six pack, Hopslam is cheaper than Manu DIPAs that are bomber only. Sure, its alot for a six pack, but this isn't just any beer here. It is as solid of a DIPA as I have had, and I would put it next to any of the East/West Coast Giants any day."
"Great beer, but I'm not sure its worth the OMGOMGOMG thing it gets."
"Chad"
"I could have a few of these but be careful cause the alcohol sneaks up on you. Overall I think this beer could be better and its good, but nothing spectacular like I expected."
"Chewy resinous medium body that's on the fuller end of the spectrum with an explosion of juicy luscious dank hops. The hops are uber fresh and provide a slightly bitter dryness that lingers troughout into a slightly hot finish. There is a very prominent citrus fruit presence with hints of mango, pineapple, lemon and orange peel. A sweet honey character comes through mid-palate, complimenting the sweetness of the citrus notes and adding to the fullness of the palate. The sweetness is balanced by a dry earthy pine presence. Maltiness is very subtle but contributes to the amazing complexity and balance of this excellent beer. Nas mentioned above their is a bit of alcohol heat toward the end of the palate but overall the high ABV is excellently masked, making this beer dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"D: The abv is well masked. Probably more drinakble than it should be at this level."
"Very recommended if you can find some. Thanks to Erik for giving me one!"
"D - Price for where I live is a bit steep but I would want another and if it was readily available look out wallet."
"Bell's scored big with this one, holy crap. What an awesome beer!"
"D- the deliciousness of this beer is dangerous. it is a big beer, but the 10% hardly shows it's face and I can easily drink too much. the $3/12oz price is really not bad in comparison to other top rated IIPAs ie. Pte, PtY, Dreadnaught."
"Overall - This beer is freaking awesome, huge flavor, lots of grapefruit and honey flavors. I wish I could drink this all the time."
"Oh sweet jesus its back!!! gotta say this is my favorite time of the year because of the inevitable release of this beer. Nice hazy golden hue and a nose that if was made into a perfume, i would fall in love with any girl wearing it. Tons of citrus, like every type of citrus fruit was squeezed into this fine brew. Not overly bitter, but just enough to make you want to pucker a little bit, very smooth and packed with more fresh hop taste than one could hope for. This is definately a beer i could sit down a pound a lot of, the only problem is the 10% ABV, which isnt a problem as much as an obstacle. wish this was more readily available throughout the year so i wouldnt have to stockpile so much at once, but i'll take it when i can get it and in as much quantity as possible!"
"Summary: Very cool beer, if you're a hop head, you will love the hop bite right away and the hoppy nose. If you're not so much into the hops, try this beer because that hop bite you don't like goes away fairly quickly and different tastes come through in this beer. But please remember that this review is being done by a hop head."
"This isn't as bitter and hoppy as I remember, in fact I've had many much more potent recently.. (The Oracle and The Liberator come to mind) and is pretty mild in when compared to those. Hops still are the centerpiece of the beer, but it is actually one of the more balanced DIPAs."
"Drinkability: I'm reviewing HopSlam in April, so it's a few months old. The hop characteristics have probably faded, and now the alcohol taste might be starting to creep out a bit more. It's a good beer, without a doubt. I plan on buying it again during the next season of brewing, although I still think Two Hearted Ale keeps its place for the top beer from Bell's for me."
"CHEERS!!"
"Like many other people, I wonder how this could possibly be a 10% ABV beer. It's big on the hops, but nothing like an imperial stout where you get a lot of vinous qualities from the alcohol. Very smooth and goes down easy. Dangerously drinkable."
"Libation: Christ, this is a good beer. I've had Hopslam in previous years and this is probably the best yet. Save for the 10% ABV, it is eminently drinkable. This brew appears simple but is surprisingly complex when you stop this analyse the taste. It has a complex honey and hop base, but strikes you with all kinds of floral aromas: fruity, spicy, and interesting. It is crisp and smooth, but mostly umami overall. I rarely drink just one, simply superb."
"Spot on for a really well balanced DIPA. There are other beers trying to be stronger and more meaty, but this beer passes these up by far - and raises the bar on them. I'd say skip beers like the 120 IPA and stick with this. It's loads better."
"D - A well rounded IIPA, so tasty yet not extremely drinkable since by the end of the pint you feel, well...hopslammed. The beer is great fresh and I prefer it to the bottle, but should be approached with a reasonable amount of caution as it tastes similar to many beers well below its level of abv"
"Easy drinking, big fresh hop flavors, with a strong mouthfeel from front to back. Great stuff, and a very consistent seasonal. We might miss out on a lot of quality west coast offerings, but Hopslam isn't a bad consolation prize."
"I could have a few of these which is saying a lot since i don't usually enjoy IPA's of any sorts. This however is an exceptional IPA no matter how you look at it."
"Side Notes: I am very happy with this, definitely going to search for more of it."
"D: One of this beer's best features is appearing simple but surprising you at every turn with complexities. It has a solid honey and hops base, but with all kinds of floral scents, tropical fruits, and spices. Its smooth yet crisp, and cold but finishes warm. Excellent."
"Hazy copper with a small eggshell cap that leaves sticky rings of lace on the glass. The smell is pretty hop forward with dank and fruity pineapple and grapefruit rind hop notes with just a touch of honey. The flavor on this one is like drinking fresh hops straight up with just enough malt backbone and light honey sweetness to keep it in check. The alcohol is well hidden. Mild carbonation and medium bodied. Hopslam actually almost lives up to it's hype. This is what I look for in a DIPA. This beer is pretty darn hard to beat when served fresh."
"Poured an almost clear, bright, orange-honey with nearly an inch of white creamy head. Good rentention and lacing throughout. Smell is amazing...crisp floral hops, fresh citrus and pine. Taste lets the hops explode. The bitterness is so crisp and fresh and is perfectly balanced with smooth honey and a very light malt presence. Ever so slight alcohol presence that actually compliments the total balance and adds a bit of warmth. Mouthfeel is very nice. Very smooth, nice amount of carbonation while still having an almost creamy feel on the tongue. Semi-dry finish that lets an almost perfect bitterness, that begs for the next sip, linger on the tongue. It's amazing how quickly you will find yourself at the bottom of this 10% abv. I really had to resist the urge to have another, which was probably a good idea. There's always tomorrow. Highly recommended, especially for a draught that you can get on the east coast."
"While this is bitter and hoppy it is just so darn enjoyable. I can definitely see why people track this down every winter."
"D: I can't imagine a beer more drinkable than this. Flavor is fantastic. Mouthfeel is excellent, helping me enjoy the balance of this beer. Clean, crisp, and incredibly refreshing, though this is a seasonal, its a beer for every occasion and weather. Hot, cold, mild, whatever you're doing and however the weather outside, you just can't go wrong with Hopslam."
"Pointless addition the following year and this shit is still spot on. Absolutely amazing."
"Hopslam is everything I expected and more. For a 10% hop bomb this beer is SUPER drinkable. As I said, I had three of these and besides being a bit tipsy, I felt great. If I had more time and $$ I probably would have ordered another."
"Slightly hazy orange-gold pour with a small white head. Aroma is lots of citrusy hops and honey sweet malt with a little bit of noble hop spicinesses and a hint of orange zest. Tastes like a glass full of wet, juicy, piny hops with a little noble hop spice and a very slight malt background. Body is a bit on the thin side with a tingly carbonation. Note: Batch 8283 seems to have a sharper pine note to the hop profile."
"D- Is this really 10%? The alcohol was well hidden and I could drink this all night. The hops were not overwhelming and the sweetness of the honey helped balance the finish. I'm glad I was finally able to try it and only wish I had managed to pick up some sixers."
"*I have to drop the smell of HopSlam just a tad after getting a whif of Pliny the Younger on Monday. While HopSlam is a gem, that dry-hopped for a month goodness of PtY is just killer."
"Drank this one with my beer-chili and it was faaaantastic. Overall a very drinkable 10% DIPA. Marvelous."
" With this many flavors going on at once it would tend to be a ale with a giant carry over of after tatse. i find this not to be the case at all. Hopslam finishes cleanly for an ale of this style. That can be quite dangerous for this bad boy."
"Don't be."
"And Thanks to my friend Jim and his awesome wife, bro, and cousin for letting me tag along!"
"Serving type: Bottle."
"Overall one of the most drinkable high abv beers on the planet. I managed to polish off a twelve pack of this over the weekend."
"D- Again this beer is intgralling! At 10% alcohol, you expect nothing but booziness. Couldn't be more wrong! I could drink this beer at anytime of year at anytime of day. It's smooth hoppy flavor goes down all right! Extremely drinkable and a great beer!"
"The funny thing, I wonder how many of you are actually reading this review since there's 1300 other ones and if you're checking a BA score on this one, chances are you already know something about its mystique."
"Overall a very well hidden high ABV, balanced non-cloying flavors and a less than syrupy texture make Hopslam seem heaven sent. This gives any DIPA a run for its money in the strength vs. drinkability category."
"D: A terrific brew that is well deserving of it's accolades, a hardy well done to Bell's! the brewer's did a great job distinguishing themselves from the """west coast""" DIPA style and still achieving a beer with serious bite and good balance. That being said, I was a tad disappointed, expecting this brew to crack the top 10 of my tastings, but then I quickly realized you can never be disappointed when you try a brew of this quality. This is clearly a must try, a classic well deserving of praise."
"I'd drink a dozen of these in a a sitting if I could, but the ABV forces me to be satiisfied with a couple at a time at most."
"Apricot golden body, tiny hop flecks visible and a classic ivory creamy, spritzy cap. The nose is very aromatic like a freshly prepped bowl of ambrosia. Lots of ripe citrus in the nose, specifically tangerine and ruby red grapefruit. Small pine character in the background. The taste is crisp, hoppy and I could tell upon first drink the mouthfeel is superb. The label claims this beer was brewed with honey and I think I could tell that for myself even if they didn't help out with that bit of information. Hops, hops and more hops, well balanced though with a good sized malt backbone,pale and caramel malts try to balance the hop onslaught and do, almost, lots of honey encrusted tangerine, resinous, pithy hops buds, the honey gives a sweet, sugary parity to the beer along with notes of dried apricots. Mouthfeel is sharp, nectary and crisp. The taste is big but not great. I appreciate the boldness, bitterness, balance and power of the hops, it's just not amazing. I'll say it, it's overrated a little. Change the name from Hopslam to Bells Double IPA and this beer averages to an A- and doesn't crack the top 100 or garner as much hype."
"Overall, Bell's HopSlam is one of those special beers that you only come across once in a while. An unusually drinkable DIPA with way more character than the vast majority of beers that I normally drink. Pure deliciousness."
"The aroma was unlike anything I've had before. The sheer volume of citrus, esp. grapefruit, and pine is truly unbelievable. I'm talking grapefruit smoothie. Great taste, the honey helps round out the malt, perhaps too much and just a bit too sweet for my liking, but nonetheless a pretty special beer."
"My one beef with HopSlam is the color, which is similar to an every-day Lager. Otherwise, it can best be described as a perfect balance of sweet and bitter with each characteristic existing in the extreme."
"Pours a hazy amber copper red in a pint glass,the smell is floral citrus grapefruit hoppiness,well balanced honey sweetness and west coast hops make this a Classic DIPA,This one slide right down,mouth feel is silky smooth,The alcohol in this one is hidden and makes for an easy drink,This one is a sleeper at 10% you could have a number of these down before ya know it,this is one beer that leaves ya pine for another"
"This beer could easily be the prototype for what a double IPA is supposed to be. Thick two finger head that held up well with good belgian lacing. Color is a light golden color. Aroma is outstanding. Lots of nice grassy hops upfront with citrus in the background. Loads of dry hopping. Flavor was citrus hops, with a good malt balance. Could tell it was a high alcohol beer. Pretty much flawless. CO2 just right. Best Bell's beer I have ever had."
"Drinkability:I was craving an IPA and this satisfied my needs and then some. This was a unique one from what I've tried. This would be very intense if not for the added honey I'd have to think. I drank this nice and fresh and it let me know. Outside of the strange finish which turned me off quite a bit this was a thoroughly enjoyable beer. I'm pretty sure this was exactly the thing they were going for when they brewed this."
"Beer poured orange with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is perfect, totally perfumed by citrus hops, even halfway into the bottle! Taste is sweet, citrus hops greet you kindly with sweet honey lingering nicely in the background. Strong malt backbone blends in to keep things nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is silky smooth from the honey and malts, a full bodied brew that glides nicely across the palate. Drinkability is perfect, the high abv is well hidden. The honey makes this a sweet brew but also makes it dangerously drinkable! There has been a lot of chatter about this brew in the forums lately and i can definitely see why it is highly touted!"
"Overall this deserves to be one of the top rated DIPA's in the world. An awesome beer that I'm glad I have about 14 left of."
"D: 10% alcohol normally makes me slow my drinking down to a sip and a crawl, this isn't the case with Hopslam. My pallet is in good shape, my taste buds are in awe, my buzz is in check, and I'll be happy to crack open another."
"If you like hops then this is just the beer for you but to have more than a couple you would seriously have palate fatigue. This ain't no session beer. Also have it fresh!! It will blow you away fresh but it seriously will fade over time."
"Drinkability: (4.0) While high in ABV and IBUs, Bell's has produced a beer that, while in the Extreme category, is very easy to drink, and is by far one of the best double IPAs in todays market."
"Drinkability: Good. HopSlam is not perfect, but it is the best DIPA that I have encountered. What also helps is that HopSlam is relatively cheap and abundant when it is in season."
"It's really friendly and original, making it my favorite of all time. Newman, you magnificent bastard!"
"Pours a great thick head that sticks around. Has a strong bodied dark golden color with a lot of activity about. Very strong, vibrant aroma. Very appealing. I'm not one that typically likes hop infused beers, but this one is great. The label calls it a """biting,bitter,tongue bruiser of an ale.""" I don't think it is as rough as they might make it seem. Very drinkable, and at 10% abv that is saying something."
"This is definitely one of my favorites. Given the limited release, I feel like I need to stock up when it's available so I can enjoy the experience for longer than the month or two it's brewed."
"I've drank 2 so far out of my 6 pack. Both times I had planned on drinking two, and both times had to switch to something else after drinking one. It's delicious, but so hardcore that one bottle will do you."
"the beer pours a golden color with a small amount of head. Looks fresh and great already. The smell is very strong and floral. Smells very complex right off the bat. I get floral with a hint of citrus and malt. Definitely one of the strongest most complex smells i have gotten from an IPA. The taste is amazing! It is floral with a hint of citrus at first and finishes with a touch of malt and honey backbone, very well balanced. I don't usually like much malt in my IPAs, but this is done right! Mouthfeel is fine for and DIPA a bit thicker than a normal IPA, as to be expected. Drinkability is surprisingly great for a 10% DIPA, only downfall is that it tastes so good, that you want more, but the ABV prohibits you from drinking too much."
"D-I still can't believe how easy these go down. What? It's 10%? Really? The ABV will definitely sneak up on you though, be careful... I speak from experience."
"D - Fantastic beer. Definitely leaves me wanting another... tomorrow."
"This gracious transition allows this particular beer to be both robust, and yet, also extremely drinkable because of the subtle and smooth juxtaposition of the intense hops proportionally balanced by a sweet merger of honey and malt, flourishing with this brew's ability to transcend from a very intense hop distinction to a sweet, almost nectar-like effect in its final palate effects. Simply put, this is a """must-have beer""" for any hop head or anyone who wants to try a great beer!"
"Doesn't feel like a 10% abv. Actually very light and crisp. Could drink this forever."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for a 10% DIPA. Wow. You definitely couldn't polish off a six-pack in one night (if you do, bravo), but you can easily down one or two of these quickly before realizing you just had a hop bomb that's packing 10% abv."
"On the palate I'm amazed at the honeyed & gently sweet flavors that start things off for the big hop flavors that follow. Although they're full-flavored, they're not overwhelming like a Double Bastard, for example. Just right for this style, IMO. Alcohol is masked relatively well and this is a delight to drink. Rating relative to style, this is probably the most drinkable DIPA I've had."
"D - High aside from the ABV. Plus, the fact that its a limited release makes you want to make it last."
"May the fine ladies and gents at Bell's be thanked, especially that cute dread-head girl who served me this august."
"M/D - Not that I have had that many but this by far is the hoppiest brew that I have enjoyed to date. Being pretty fresh though I couldn't do that many in one sitting but very much so worth it. I enjoyed a one year old HopSlam at New Years and of course lighter on the hop kick but still very enjoyable. A for sure brew to drink fresh or with some age on it, I had bought a sixer so I plan to update and add to this review with some added notes as time goes by!"
"Drinkability- Most DIPA's have such a punch of bitterness, that they become a beer to be slowly sipped. Much like a cup of coffee that was hot enough to sue over. But this is so smooth and delightful, one cannot taste the alchohal even though it is 10%. I have had many beers at the 7.5% mark that where much more noticble. A great session beer, however you might end up on the floor if you attempt it."
"Bell's hopslam. What can you say that hasn't already been said. I bought this beer in bottle form for a decent price, $4 a bottle. Poured the beer into a standard American pint and it held a great frothy head. Immediate overwhelming hop presence in the nose. I could smell this beer all evening. This beer taste of a hop plant, check the label. It starts strong and finish's like a 12 round heavy weight champion. It's mouthfeel is a like a lingering hangover sitting on your tongue. I feel that if you drink more than two you will not be able to drink anything else for the rest of the night...and I would be totally fine with that."
"Drinkability: This is a first rate DIPA that is well made and very very drinkable. I could easily have another right now but will pass because of the ABV. I'm sure I'll be having this again. One particularly nice thing about this beer is that one can taste the hops without the tongue rasping that characterizes many DIPAs. But that being said, for me this is not at the top of my short list simply because out of the bottle and with a bit more age I can pick up traces of the honey which is something I prefer more hidden or not in the beer at all. I like this one much better on tap."
"D- With the high abv I dont think I could have more then a couple of these before I moved on to something else. A bit disappointing, not my favorite imperial IPA."
"D- High, ABV in mind... I could get into some serious trouble with this one. One of the better third coast offerings. Worth seeking out if you like your hops."
"I don't normally like IPA/DIPA blends but I feel this is a beer that not only exemplifies but help to set the standards of a beer."
"Drinkability: Oh yeah!! My problem is I didn't buy enough of it. I'm kicking myself in the ass for not biting the bullet. Do yourself a favor and stock up. Good job Bell"""s!!"
"Awsome as always."
"This may be my new benchmark for IPA's. Well done Bell's!"
"This was totally worth the wait. I realized I made another mistake though...I should have bought much more than the two sixers that I did...because I'm already done with one and I'm not ready to wait another year to have this again!"
"Edited grades for this year"
"D- This section isn't even fair. Hopslam is one of the best drinking beers that I have ever had. Couple that with the fact that it is an astonishing 10% DIPA and there is no contest. I would put drinkability at 5 if it were a 6% IPA. The only negative (which I refused to adjust the score for as it is not a fault of Bell's, but rather the absurd distribution structure in Philadelphia) is the absurd price tag ($93...it retails for $60 at the brewery. Like I said, no bearing on score."
"D: Top-notch drinkability. Bell's HopSlam is in a league of it's own."
"Somewhere between a light and medium body. Very crisp with a lot of bitter bite to it."
"Serving type: on tap and bottle"
"Edit: I just have to bump up the taste score. Blake assured me that by the third one I would be worshiping this beer. And he was right. I will never be able to get enough of this."
"D: this has it all... a huge hop profile that is well balanced (read not overly bitter), a nice malt backbone that adds depth to the experience, and a dangerously well hidden high ABV. I am enjoying this more than I have in past years."
"d - Very drinkable. If you are a fan of hoppy beers, I would highly recommend checking this out; it's definitely a great beer. Can't believe its 10%!"
"D/Overall - Excellent beer here. I usually save this style for the last beer of the night, but if I were to do that with this one I'd probably have to be carried home. I could start my night off with this and be fine for an hour or two. Delicious."
"Nice crisp flavor, creamy mouth feel. First taste has a bitey bitterness...followed by a mellowing creamy honey sweetness, ending with a throat warming from the 10% abv. Great DIPA."
"Drinkability: Insanely drinkable and very dangerous at 10%. Hoppy beers do not get any better than this."
"D: 100% better than the tap. This is what I was expecting!"
"This was a fantastic brew. Bell's definitely continues to impress me with their stuff. I would not hesitate to recommend this to any hophead."
"D: Great example of the style, very nice when it's fresh on draught."
"This is a very good ipa, well balanced and drinkable. Definetley up there with PtE."
"I am pretty disappointed with this batch. I honestly think that I have a batch that they forgot to add the bittering hops to. So sorry Bells...I wouldn't recommend Hopslam to anyone if they are looking for a good DIPA."
"Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and almost insanely drinkable. The ten percent alcohol is so well hidden that I barely know it is present. I have been waiting for a long time to try this one, and was not disappointed. Pick this up, or trade for it while you can."
"Very drinkable, almost too much so for a DIPA of this magnitude (10% ABV)."
"D: I could drink this beer all day and all night. The rep from Bells was at the bar, we talked to him for a bit and he bought the 4 of us another round as well as giving us glasses that were meant for the bar."
"Drinkability - In context, it is drinkable. Overly hoppy beers, as a general rule, are lower in drinkability, but the fruitiness and light honey in this beer, and the snappiness of it, make it easier to drink than many in the category. Still, I'd say a single bottle is about as much as I'd care to have in a sitting."
"D- At first it seems like I could drink this all night. Great hop flavors leave me craving more, but after one bottle, the reality of the alcohol content bring me back to earth. A beer that can be enjoyed quickly in moderation (?)(!)."
"Notes: Had not had a good beer from Bells in a while. This was maybe redemption."
"D - A great seasonal treat from Bell's."
"D_I poured five of these into my face very easily."
"Had this at a neighborhood pub in a brandy snifter. The beer is a golden/orange color with some hop haze and a small but clingy white head. The aroma is intensely hoppy, slap you in the face American hops, tangerine and apricot aromas come to my mind. The flavor is like the smell, very very hoppy with a solid yet not overpowering hop bitterness. There is a bit of sweet malt and a warming quality from the high ABV, although that is appreciated and is not harsh. The carbonation is medium and body medium as well. Overall an intense, well crafted, very enjoyable beer. At its ABV it is amazing how drinkable this beer is, I especially enjoy the over the top hop flavor/aroma and yet not exceedingly bitter."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Great lacing develops as I consume this nectar of God. The smell is absolutely amazing. Its pungent and overpowering but just beckons my lips to the glass. The taste, the name says it all. Its as if all the hops off the vine gathered their might together to just pop me in the mouth. The honey doesn't do much to this beer as far as sweetening it, but rather keeps the bitterness in check as all of the other flavors develop. I think it helps to tame the alcohol warmth, while not totally killing it. What an amazing elixir."
"drinkability - this beer makes you want to drink all that you can get your hands on but watch out it is 10%abv"
"This stuff is amazing. A little more expensive about $17.99/6pk but worth every penny. If you love hops you will love this."
"I wish Hopslam day was every year. This is truly a world-class beer. Just like some of the most famed figures in history, this beer isn't perfect. But it's so memorable (especially when this fresh) that it deserves it's place on any list of legendary American beers."
"Orange/gold in color, big white head. Tons of citrusy hop aroma with a touch of alcohol sweetness. The taste is pretty stellar, the name is pretty fitting, you get slammed with hops. I think the alcohol is too high to really enjoy much but to be this big its quite drinkable and not plagued with too much sweetness. Overall a great beer from Bell's but Two Hearted will always be my Bell's go to."
"This is just too difficult to drink. It is a struggle to finish by yourself. 12oz of this at a time is just too much."
"This beer is still quite the hop bomb. Full bodied, great hop flavor in the midpalate, a slight aftertaste. There is a nice malt flavor in the front of the mouth. Second taste, rather cleansing. I really am enjoying this beer. The aftertaste grows as you drink, does not really affect drinkability. Both drinkability and mouthfeel high."
"D- For being a pretty good beer, I could have a few of these. It doesn't kill the taste buds like some DIPAs. If you get a chance to try this, do so, the hops aren't overwhelming and there is a touch of sweetness that works really well."
"What's not perfect here? It's pretty rich and strong, so you can only drink so much. It's too expensive. It's best to wait a year or two before you drink it. These are all big negatives! It's just TOO good. These are pretty murky, even after almost two years. Of course I will be sure to seek out more when it becomes available (in February?). This may be my favorite brew. Definitely in the top few."
"Another hit from Bell's. This brew has a great golden-orange hue with a big white head. The aroma is fresh citrus blossoms and the taste is good. There is a little too strong of a mouth coating that never goes away; sometimes that's a good thing and other times it's annoying. It definately leaves you excited about the next time."
"January batch properly cared for by the distributor and drinkin in November. Some of the hops have fades and the sweet malt is slightly more pronounced. Still Awesome!"
"d- high for something with this strong of a hop flavor,"
"Anyway, it poured well - typical IPA color with a small, half-inch head. Smell is out of this world! It smells like the freshest, hoppiest juice I have ever experienced. This is what I imagine raw hops would taste like if you pressed them and drank them. And if I thought the smell was outstanding, the taste is even more ridiculous! So fresh and delicious! It takes a minute to get used to as the taste can be overwhelming at first, which is probably a good thing at 10% ABV. Totally worth $18 (now $26!) a 6-pack, and I can't wait until it comes out again."
"D: I wouldn't want to have too many of these, and at 10% abv that's probably a good thing."
"As a hophead I strongly approve."
"M+D for a 10% this has a good mouthfeel and is still highly drinkable so this is some goood stuff"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a bright orange/amber color with a thick white head that settles, leaving a nice sticky trail into a slight cap on the brew. The aroma is extremely floral from the strong hops. There is some spice and pine notes. The taste is fresh and clean and crisp. There is a nice balance from some malt front and a bitter hop finish. This is a very good example of a IPA. Nice work Bell's!"
"Picked up some fresh Hopslam recently and gave it another go. Its a decently good beer, but i'm not seeing the hype. Its very smooth and tastes like honey with a malt backbone. But where is the bitterness and the hops that I was expecting? Maybe I am just becoming immuned to ipas and imperial ipas to be blown away anymore. This does go down easy though, no hint of the 10% alc at all."
"Overall: Perfect score for drinkability from me, r/t 10% abv and drinks like 5%. No alcohol presence, just fresh hop and honey. Overall, this can hang with the big boys on the west coast. Would probably be even better on tap."
"Smooth, creamy with a light effervescence and full-ish body. Very good stuff and I'm NOT a hop fan at all. Good job Bell's."
"A pale honeyish amber with a thick off-white head. A good amount of lace and foam sticking to the glass. A bitter citrus smell on the nose with hints of pine and a whiff of something sweet. The citrus comes through on the taste with a lot of dried orange peel and a little grapefruit. There's a nice amount of pine in there as well. The sweetness is more developed than with the aroma and serves as a nice counterbalance to the bitterness of the hops. Not sure if it's the honey or the malt. Whatever it is, the taste is absolutely phenomenal. A nice dry finish leaves me refreshed yet wanting more. It's easy to forget this is 10% ABV as it's very drinkable. I think Hopslam is an appropriate name. I could see myself slamming these back all night. The balance of flavors is hard to beat and it's so ridiculously refreshing. I want to gulp it. A friend of mine gave me a few bottles to try. Needless to say, I'll be buying a bunch of this on it's next release and I highly recommend you do the same. Kick-ass beer."
"I have to concur with all the others, drink'r fresh."
"D - Really damn high for the style, and especially for a 10% beer. In my opinion, this should set the bar for what a DIPA should be."
"This one reminded me a lot of this year's batch of Lake Erie monster - which I also liked a lot"
"a shame that the hops are so fragile. will have to seek a more timely trade next year."
"finally, i scored this on tap,at the bell's eclectic cafe in kalamazoo, knowing it's only available in bottles jan-march, i was surprised to see it on tap amongst the many other brews available - this beer was superb, a nice pour with a 2 finger head, hazy amber color, hoppy sweet smell and WOW on taste - a nice hop bite with a sweet lingering finish - i found a couple of 6pks in new buffalo, probably past their prime, but very good nonetheless - i was excited to grab a couple @ 16.99 a six - two of these (on tap)went down too easy at the cafe( accompanied by an excellent pulled pork sandwich) - the abv doesn't show it's presence til you're done - real tasty stuff either way - lives up to the hype -"
"Final thoughts: This beer seems to be pretty highly acclaimed but I'm a little disappointed. Its a pretty big hop bomb with a slight malt base and lots of sweet honey. The candybar taste adds a nice touch but its a little too much honey and sweet taste for me, and the hops don't come through the way I would have expected."
"Pours a nice amber color and the glass I poured has a little hop haze effect. Smells like citrus or grapefruit. Laces the glass well. Tastes like a double IPA with the upfront hop blast and has a nice malt backbone to it to balance it out. Overall one of the best double IPA's I've had."
"Nice copper color with a slight head and good lacing. Nice aroma due to the hops. Some esters are present; however, they are hard to identify due to the hops. The flavor is balanced between sweet, sour, and bitter. The mouthfeel and drinkability are superior. In short, a wonderful beer."
"D: Despite the very high ABV this double IPA is not too overbearing and pleasure to drink!"
"I've had this on draft and have had many bottles. It never ceases to shock me to find that I have quaffed a 12 oz brew clocking in at 10% in less than five minutes. It is that drinkable. I can't recommend this beer highly enough."
"Update 2: Had on draft for the first time on 1/26/11. Still an exceptional beer - A little less honey in the taste due to the uber freshness of the hops and also slightly lighter body but still smooth and oily. Earns same grades as previous reviews so no seperate listing."
"Overall, an excellent ADIAP that is worthy of the rank and hype. Most highly recommend. Great non-bitter hop aroma and flavor that shows excellent balance with the honey tinged malt. Very easy drinker. Just wish it was easier to get some. Rotation: not available here but would be a big player if it was. [H;Y;ship]"
"Overall: I must be in the minority because I was not completely enamored with this beer as 99% of BA's are. I would rate this rather ordinary as there was nothing that stood out comparable to other DIPA's such as DFH 90min or Victory Hop Wallop. Maybe my expectations were high due to everyone raving over this beer when it comes out. hmmm..."
"a golden well malted beer with indistinguishable abv compared to some. nice honey malt, bit o honey, peppery lemon zest nose. well hopped... or more so balanced hop palate for the malt character. palate of honey, grass, lemon, and mild sweet tea aspect. this beer ages very well."
"The highest praise I can give is that I tend to not like big-hop beers, but this is just a fantastic brew. Well worth seeking out."
"D: An exceptionally drinkable Imperial IPA. Not for the faint of heart, but a great beer."
"Probably my favorite beer ever, anywhere, of any style, period! Nothing wrong with it at all. Great taste, great smell, perfectly balanced, hides the 10% ABV well. The only problem with it is that it's only available for a very short time each year. But that probably makes it that much better."
"Taste is not as strong in the hop character as others, but that is OK. The first taste that comes to mind is sweetness. Hop and citrus balance the taste. Not much malt in this one. Unbelievably drinkable for it's ABV. Truly refreshing and a great example. One of the best tasting beers I have had regardless of style."
"Of course, lots of hops in the nose with citrus, pine, and pineapple. Rockin bitterness in the flavor with pine, tangerine and tropical fruits, more bitterness, and alcohol that also contributes to the mouthfeel. A party in the mouth. Warming alcohol would (or should) prevent one from downing too many of these and since it's available for such a short time I find it easy to savor one at a time."
"Pours an orange copper color with a huge frothy white head that leaves lacing. The smell is sweet upfront with tons of hop aroma and nice bit of citrus like orange and grapefruit. The taste starts sweet and pretty hoppy, then somewhat bitter with a slight hop bitter aftertaste. I was expecting a bigger bitter bite considering the bottles advertisement, but no big deal. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth, medium body, with great flavors and a nice depth to the taste. Not an over the top flavor that gets old, but a great beer that keeps things fresh. This is a great drinker considering the high ABV, it is really hard to tell that it is so high, a half a six pack could be too much, but a great hophead beer."
"Had this on tap at Vintner Wine Market in Charlotte. Appearance was a hazy, glowing orange. Smells like nectarines. Taste is unbelieveable: Imagine sweet grapefruit juice mixed with honey. Big mouthfeel that lingers. Finish is just as amazing with absolutely no alcohol heat. It's hard to believe this is a high gravity beer (until I finished the pint). This is my favorite Double IPA. I would put this on tap at home all the time if I could..."
"The taste is Cataclysmic! Spicey, earthy hops, rich malts and honey do melon. Slightly warm from the alcohol but I could not wait to take another sip. Simply deliscious!"
"Purchased from Consumer Beverage Center in Hales Corners, WI. Pours a bright golden body with a thick white head that falls to a cap and lasts to the end. Aroma is a big blast of sweet, fruity hops. Excellent malt sweetness used to balance out the hop bitterness. Even at 10% alcohol, the drinkability is extremely high."
"Pretty much the perfect beer! Pours a beautiful golden hue with a rich head of foam which leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of hoppy citrus goodness. Hints of honey, well balanced, amazing drinkable for such a big beer. Best when fresh, even a few months past prime it's still a delicious brew. Don't pass this up!"
"Pours smooth golden, medium, but somewhat ample foam. Strong citrus nose, bursting with hops, apples, caramel and wonderful generally understated sweetness. Absolutely wonderful body, fairly big caramel at the front and great hop finish. This beer is surprisingly light for the huge magnitude. This is utterly amazing. I wish I could drink it everyday."
"12oz bottle received as an extra. This one has been on my wants for a while and I was glad to finally be able to have this. Poured a orange body with a big loose rocky head with amazing lace as it went on. Smelled very citrusy, piny, grapefruit. Tasted very hoppy, resinous, some pineapple, piny. Medium body, thick sticky mouthfeel. Amazing DIPA"
"i thought 2hearted was the beesnees(sp?) but then i had hopslam...Larry Bell i beg you to distribute in Colorado!"
"One of my favorite beers of all. Like I said I cannot wait to get this fresh again next year."
"Overall, this beer tended to be on the citrus side but i felt that made it quite a refreshing DIPA."
"D: Just awesome. A great beer, hides the 10% pretty well too. Had this on tap a couple of times in Jan. and Feb. so I have experienced it fresh and the hop profile was bigger, but I have no problem rating it how I did. Possibly my favorite from Bell's."
"Notes: This review is for a bottle that some would say was past its prime. I do remember more sweetness in the flavor and smoothness in the finish when I had it on tap back in February. I remember being very, very impressed. I was less impressed this time, but still think it's a stand-out. Hopefully, I can try more another fresh from the tap next year and update."
"D: Very drinkable. The 10% ABV is hardly noticeable in this."
"Many thanks to mikereaser for allowing me to enjoy this incredible beer."
"awesome mouthfeel as this is a very thin version of a iipa and i dont mean thin in a bad way. it just adds to the drinkability of this beer. I have to admit im getting to the party a few months late so all these scores could change dramatically with a fresh batch this year. i cant wait."
"D: The lack of a sticky aftertaste allows it to go down quickly."
"overall, this is an amazing brew i loved it, not something to have a lot of at a time though"
"Pours a nice light amber color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing. The nose is sharp citrus with a sweet smell (probably from the addition of honey). The taste is fantastic with loads of grapefruit up front finished with a slightly sweet honey flavor. Mouthfeel is nice without too much carbonation, seems just right for the style."
"Had this with a friend earlier tonight and very much enjoyed it. Poured a nice golden color with medium-thick head that left plenty of lacing. Smelled wonderfully of citrusy hops. Taste was a little less hoppy than the smell. Very smooth and masked the 10% alcohol extremely well. I could easily have drunk 3 or 4 without realizing how buzzed I was getting."
"I know that it is controversial to rate a DIPA, or any IPA for that matter that may or may not have a hop profile that has been deemed """faded""". Some BA's have argued that it would be unfair to rate a DIPA/IPA that is considered faded. However, I personally feel that this should only hold true for beers that could be rated unfairly based on that fact alone. Although Hopslam may be considered faded at this point, I still saw past that and thoroughly enjoyed it. IMO this brew still had a strong hop profile, albeit, faded, and although other BA's may disagree with this, I still feel that a potentially """faded""" Hopslam was still one of the best DIPA's I have managed to get my hands on, and would like to get my hands on again ASAP(doesn't distribute to Massachusetts)."
"D- The alcohol isn't all that noticeable in the taste or mouthfeel."
"A tight and rolling large tan head sits neatly atop a hazy orange and amber brew. A sticky, curvy lace is revealed as the froth slowly drifts away, leaving a thick covering atop. Subdued and pleasant citrusy hops float to the nose. Tastes fruity, citrusy and malty upfront with the hops coming at the end, adding to, and not overpowering the palate. Spice and pine exist, as does some butterscotch or other such candy. The honey comes in and adds a nice texture to the whole experience. Equanimity is achieved across the board. The alcohol heat bites at the throat just a bit, but is welcomed, not at all bothersome, but demands care. The mouth-feel is a perfect medium, as it doesn't weigh you down; demands sipping, but also has a certain hint of fluff that allows you stay in for the long haul. This is an exceptional, highly approachable and satisfying beer that reminds me of bittersweet candy, candy which I would not hesitate to steal from a child."
"J"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and horribly refreshing."
"Love the label, which pretty much says it all, although this isn't one of those hop-drenched experiences that wipes out the tastebuds for a whole day (hi Hopsickle!). You'll get up from getting slammed by mutant hops only wanting more. Go ahead, indulge. Drinkable? From where I'm sitting, oh hell yeah."
"5.0 D: I am so glad I finally got to try this beer. It is absolutely delicious."
"Overall, a good beer to enjoy."
"If you're going to take the time to stamp the bottle with a number, might as well stamp the freaking date. . .or is this just a ploy to hide the freshness of the beer to sell more. . . ."
"Drinkability: It's incredible tasting and I'm sure if you're a hophead, you'll love it. Not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination, but a darn good drink."
"I bought a case this year, if that tells you anything about drinkability. The only reason there is any left is that I was saving some for when my friend vsited last week ... and then I bought another sixer."
"Lived up to most of the hype -- this is tasty. Have felt differently as I've worked my way through the six pack, from time to time, but very nuanced and quite drinkable. As regards the debate about drinking Hopslam as fresh as possible... I can't say anything about 2 days vs. 2 months but 2 months vs. 4 months did not show any deterioration. $17.99 for a 6 pack after shopping around though... that is a lot of money."
"Solid atmosphere. Nice appearance and sharp, profound nose. Flavor is not complex, but is 'full'. . . the subtle sweetness adds a bit, though. Great quaff."
"Bottle Pours a clear golden with an off white head. The head is frothy and lasts well. Fairly good lacing. Has a good hoppy aroma of pine, oranges, and a touch of vanilla. Has a good carbonation and a wonderful mouthfeel. The flavor is excellent. The alcohol is well hidden. Very well blended. Has a soft bitterness. It is bitter but the bite is mellow. Has an oily texture. A medium body mostly because it's so refined. A good finish with a good lingering aftertaste. This is a real good beer. Very smooth."
"Not something I'd care to drink again, especially when Bell's has much better beers in their line-up, and even better locals brews exist (see: most stuff from Founders)."
"Everyone else reviews pretty much summed this beer up so I wont get into all the mouth feel stuff. so all im gonna say it that this beer it Great!"
"Some beers at 10% with this much flavor would push you away rather than suck you in but I've had almost 30 of these and I'm ready for more! If I could have any beer in unlimited supply it would be this one! I love Bell's Hopslam!!!"
"I am reviewing the second pint I had off a cask @ BSP, yummy. The first pint was a little faint in al regards, and the second was far better. Nice vibrant orange color, a bit richer and deeper than the first pour. Little carbonation, its a cask. Lovely floral and citrus hop aroma. This second pint was far better in the hop flavor department. I get a much more pronounced bitterness, but I think the honey sweetness helps balance it out. Also make is incredible easy to drink. Too easy really. I think the middle of this cask was amazing, but also a testament to how cask settle, there is definitely a sweet spot. Off cask, it really opens up the flavor and aroma."
"As with the bottled Hopslam, huge hop flavor up front. Pungent, tart grapefruit with pine fills the mouth. Lingering, dry bitter. As this baby sits, the honey comes out. Tasty as all hell."
"d: the most drinkable hop-heavy beer i've had, just very well balanced"
"D: I know that this beer is a couple months old now, but I think the hops are still holding up well. I do look forward to trying this closer to the release, though."
"Drinkability: Session - And I can now that we've got it in Charleston!!!! I overheard that Georgia is getting Bells just next month! Great beer - Great apex of DIPA's for the growing beer drinker."
"Wow. That was an absolutely fantastic beer. It's only the second DIPA the lady-friend has ever really liked. The first? Pliny the Younger. So it's in extremely rare company. I'm only upset that I don't know when I'll get to have another. I will find a way to get a fresh one next year, that's for sures."
"M - Medium bodied, a little sticky, but not viscous like some beers of the style can be."
"Overall, I'm sure this is a MUCH better beer fresh, but I can't exactly get my hands on a fresh bottle for a little while. Given the lack of availability where I live, I really have to search it out. Even at its current age, it is an above average DIPA, but as it stands, I will take a Pliny 98 times out of 100 over this."
"D- I could drink this all day long if I had the chance. This is still one of my favorite beers and I really don't think it will change much even with all the beers I have had that were suppose to be as good as what this beer is."
"More Random Indecisiveness: had it again, and, eh,."
"Nice color, spot on for the style. Nice head. Big, juicy hop aroma.... So good. The taste was clean, fresh hop flavor. Bitter but sweet. Excellent. Slight alcohol warmth as the beer warmed. Great beer, seek out if possible. Great on cask, butter smooth."
"ABV is well hidden making it dangerous for sure."
"Thanks to my sister in Charlotte for this one."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an American pint glass. The off white head really went over the glass, had to give to a minute to reside before I poured the rest from the bottle in. The lacing that was left behind was really nice and clung to the glass till the last hoppy sip. The colors was a glowing amber, a bit darker then most DIPAs. Sweet hops come out in the aroma, but not a smack you in the face aroma. But the hops hit you big time in the taste. Even though the hops are big up front it finishes smooth and clean leaving you ready for the next tasty sip. If this guy wasn't around 10% I could drink it all night, but I could see myself getting in trouble trying to do just that."
"Drinkability: Really high. The flavors are really well-balanced and there's something for everyone in this beer from the toasty, grainy malts to the bitter hops. Really nice beer."
"About as smooth as an Double IPA can get. Incredible grapefruit smell, nice dark golden color with extended lacing. Paid $4 for a single but well worth it - looks like I need to drink these fresh. So much hops, but nothing that overpowers you to not enjoy it as a beer. Would be one of my favorites for the summer, but a bit on the pricey side to be a regular staple. Very good, however. Another great performance from Bell's."
"Really a classic -- the DIPA I've been looking for. I wish I had some more of these. When I was in Michigan in April, they were nowhere to be found -- they went that fast. Thanks ghscash for bringing one back for me. Worth the wait -- really one of the highest-quality brews I've ever had."
"d- a month ago; great, if you ignore the alcohol content. now; i've changed my mind and am not pleased. reminds me of an old maharaja."
"Wow. You can judge this book by it's cover. My only markdown was the slightly small head. Otherwise, I can't think of anything else this beer is lacking. Bell's must have a mad scientist working for them because this beer is genius. Wish they made it year-round."
"Glad I had a chance to sample this one. Imperial IPA is not my favorite style, but this is a very nice one."
"I can't get this beer in Maine, but did find it on a trip to Tampa. It certainly lives up to it's reputation. In a pint glass it has that slightly hazy orange color I expect from IIPAs. The aroma is just wonderful, a nice balance of sweet honey and tart citrus. Taste followed form, sweet malt and grapefruit. A nicely balanced, incredibly smooth beer. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I think two of these at a time are my limit."
"Edit from 1/21/11. Sampled very fresh bottle the other day. Would raise drinkability to 5, but would otherwise keep everything else the same. Fresh HS is dangerously drinkable... the beer comes across as very light, with the honey flavor in this beer masking the alchohol completely. It's the sort of beer you almost want to keep on drinking till you're comatose."
"D: If I was left with one beer in this world, and this was it, I would be a very happy man. Aside from the the higher abv (10%), this is a beer that you won't want to put down."
"Bottle, batch # 8912, which was born of Jan 13, according to the website. So, over three months. The beer is underwhelming. Aroma is hoppy, possibly a little solventy/resiny. Taste is sweet, almost to the point of cloying. There is a bitter grapefruit rind finish. I believe this is my first DIPA and I find it oddly disappointing. Given my anticipation of bitterness, I thought I would welcome a sweet malty backbone more. But it might actually be too sweet. 10% alcohol? That will be a hoot when I try to stand up."
"Batch #8907, bottled in January according to the website, drank in April. Had high hopes for this one but not initially floored as I thought I might be. It's only 3 months old, but perhaps it's starting to fade a bit. My question is, should a beer lose it's quality that quickly? I dunno... but I will definitely seek out an uber fresh sample of this when available and compare it with these notes. As is this beer pours a sturdy looking amber color, darkish, with a small head fading pretty quickly. Smell is hoppy, citrus mostly, orange peel, but then dominated by a sweet maltyness. Very heavy on the malt as well in the taste. I'm not getting destroyed by the hops here. A vanilla sweetness and an orange citrus flavor prevail over everything else. Perhaps a little too sweet from the added honey. And a little boozy to be honest. If there was a bigger hop presence this may be covered up but it's just not holding up. Malty, sweet, sticky, chewy, kind of clumsy. Not trying to knock this beer as I may not have the freshest example (but I did have three bottles to make sure) but it isn't world class in my book."
"The hops start to overwhelm as it warms, but this is still quite sippable throughout. Great brew, but not quite at the top as far as IPAs go. I'm glad I got to try this - thanks bobbydigi! (via another member.)"
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable if you like hops (which I do). High ABV makes this less of a session brew and more of a one-timer, atleast for me. Still, I will definitely be drinking more of these in the future."
"12oz. Usually I carefully decant Bell's products, but not this one. Poured a cloudy but bright amber color with a rocky, off-white head with good retention and a nice lacing. Huge floral hop and pine aroma coupled with grapefruit and some tropical mango and pineapple. Mouth-feel is thick and juicy, some carbonation that allows the flavors to cover the entire palate. Juicy ripened pineapple and grapefruit explode on the first sip, it's sweet like fresh honey, but the bitter piny hop finish is fantastically balanced with the malty sweetness. Alcohol is well concealed. This is an amazing ale. Always a favorite of mine."
"Drinkability- Big flavor might limit drinkability, but not for lack of flavor. A real winner."
"Amazingly drinkable for the ABV, and this is how the beer becomes dangerous. I would not want to be faced with this on tap at a bar - without adequate cab fare in pocket, and a free schedule the next morning."
"D: Could be the only beer I'd ever drink again, if Bell's were so gracious as to devote 50% of their capacity to this one."
"Thanks Ben! We might have to arrange for another trade on this one!"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden amber color with a small off-white head that quickly disappears, pretty good lacing. Aroma is mainly hops; pine, resin, grapefruit, and a decent caramel malt backbone. Flavor is also mainly hops. I get grapefruit, resin, honey, and a touch of alcohol. Very strong bitter finish puts action to its name. Very good beer, warms pretty well also."
"had this one on tap at the Bavarian Lodge in a 12oz. pub glass. a very clear presence with a light golden hue. great lacingleft on glass and tastes of tart honey with a sharp, bitter, and citrus punch that lasts long. fruitful and wants to be be drank all day long, but had to hold back from the extreme temptation. looking forward to many more of this fantastic brew!"
"D- One of the easiest drinking IPA/DIPAs out there. Huge hop flavor with the alcohol being exceptionally well hidden. This beer was great with a few months on it, but it is absolutely phenomenal fresh. Buy and drink immediately - 5.0"
"Pours clear gold, with a head that dissipates quickly, retaining a thin layer of foam and leaving a little lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet hay and citrus, with some brown sugar sweetness. A concentrated grassy hopslam it is. It has a strong citrus, I'd say grapefruit flavor, yet a balanced sweetness level. Most of the taste comes out at the beginning. Though concentrated, it is a well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is one to make you sad when the glass is empty and definitely glad to have another."
"I split a sixer with a friend and they went quickly, but it's definitely a palate-cleanser. Not sure I could transition from this to something else, but hey, it's good enough that you don't need to."
"A fantastic Double IPA. The only downside to this beer is the high abv. I understand its a double but it is a little overwhelming at times. But none the less a fantastic beer."
"Pours nicely with an ok amount of head. It stayed around for a while and laced well. The rest of the beer didn't lace too much. Smell was intoxicating. The only imperial IPA with more citrus and robust hops smell that I have had is Pliny. After the amazing smell that didn't hold back a bit I was expecting more from the taste. I have a bottle back from an early January batch and i have heard that the taste is better with freshness on this one. Citrus fruits, hops, and honey dominate the beginning and middle but the end of the flavor is pretty big on malt and alcohol. It's pretty good on mouthfeel but it's a little light. i will definitely try this one again next time it is available."
"Clear-amber/orange topped with two fingers of off-white head that hangs around forever. Smells like citrus-hop-candy: sweet, caramel, citrus, bright, honey. Flavor is too sweet for me. Balance is close to what it should be, but sweetness of malt (honey?) is too much for the style. Hops are great both in aroma and flavor. Fairly light feel for the style. Not too cloying or syrupy. Easy-to-drink for such a big beer, but sweetness prohibits slows things down."
"D: A really high ABV keeps this from being a session obviously, but 2-3 in a sitting is more than doable."
"Anyone I would drink this again but prefer a fresher bottle."
"It's delicious but not what I would categorically call very drinkable."
"My favorite double IPA to date. Pours a nice amber color, smell sensation with citrusy hops and some I couldn't describe. Just delicious. The hop taste is just perfect. I was glad I decided to split this six pack because the alcohol was so well disguised I would have been in a world of hurt later. My friend is not really a beeradvocate and he loved it. Must try!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass..Pours a nice coppery hue. Aroma is overwhelmingly pleasant, with some citrus, piney, and earthy notes pleasant. I'm guessing several types of hops were used here, with a surplus being put on the aromatic hops. The flavor is extremely balanced well. The hop flavor profile seems to lean on the citric side, and it isn't nearly as imposing as I anticipated, which is not a bad thing here. I wouldn't guess this was any where near 10%. The malt profile really comes through well, and I the taste of honey works rather nicely. All in all, definitely on my top 5 IPA's because of its balance."
"The first smell I got was hops, then citrus and pineapple ,and the taste was the same. The first flavor is the citrusy hops, then a little sweetness and then the alcohol. Although it's a strong 10% the alcohol blends right in and the beer is quite deceiving in this respect. Lastly the hop bitterness lingers, but in a good way. The feel in the mouth is oily and the carbonation is quite noticeable but not overbearing. All in all a great balance of all the flavors. I've been drinking a lot of IPAs lately and this one lives up to its reputation. I think I like the Stone IPA a bit better though, however this one is definitely in a class above the rest."
"The beer is carbonated perfectly and feels great, nice and smooth, not too much alcohol flavor present making it very drinkable. I have been drinking the Harpoon Leviathon lately but this beer blows it out of the water. Similar abv, but the Leviathon doesn't hide it well at all, whereas the Hopslam is something that I could drink all day. Great beer!"
"Wow!!! What a cool beer. Honey and hops? Who would have known? It works like chocolate and peanut butter. So amazing. Seriously one of the best beers I've had in a while."
"This beer looks great, with a burnt orange color and a nice, big beige head. It's aroma is phenomenal. It is loaded with floral and citrus hops. The flavor is much the same. Such a bold, spicy and citrus hop flavor. There is also some good malt sweetness and you can definitely taste the honey that was added. It is sufficiently bitter for a DIPA. It has a full flavor and medium body. I don't crave more than one of these beers in one sitting but it is not out of the realm of possibilities since it is so good overall."
"I previously had this beer from another trade but didn't review it because it had been in the bottle too long. I'm glad I waited for a fresher sample because age tends to make the honey dominate and it becomes a hoppy mead. If had fresh enough, the honey really helps to lighten the body and accentuate the hops. Very well done."
"An excellent version of the imperial IPA. A little pricy $15.99 for a 6-pack but well worth the price if you like a hoppy IPA. Highly recommended. Like many of the other Bell products...all really well brewed."
"Drinkability is pretty good, it's a hefty, malt forward DIPA, but the hops are pungent no doubt. The high ABV is well hidden, mainly just coming through in the dry, spicy finish. At the end of the day it just wasn't quite my taste in the style, but I enjoyed it, more so when it warmed up a ton (which isn't normally the case with DIPAs for me)."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: The carbonation and body are light. One of my favorite beers ever."
"This evokes summertime fun, with is grassy, citrusy explosion. The ABV is a shocker: You don't taste it. It goes down lovely and smooth."
"D - I could easily pound these all night. Not an absolute hop bomb, but great hop presence. After having Two Hearted first, I was not expecting much, but this beer is exponentially better and completely different."
"Hopslam is unquestionably a world class beer and one of my favorites. It would make a great introduction to DIPA's as well since it is so easy drinking."
"Overall: This may be my favorite beer right now, overtaking Surly Coffee Bender. Hopslam is drying up around my area so I may have to find a sixer to hide away for a rainy day. Excellent!"
"Overall: This beer is rocks, I strongly suggest picking up a sixer."
"Its a great beer from a great brewery but its 10% so more than one would be quite a haul."
"Drinkability- I would rate this higher if I believe I could tolerate the bitterness beyond a few as well as the 10% ABV. All in all a great beer."
"D- This is a fantastic, easy drinking hop-bomb. complex and flavorful, but not as harsh as many lower ABV IPAs out there (Lagunitas, I'm looking at you, pal). I could probably drink six of these easy... which is a frightening prospect at 10%."
"Beautiful dark amber glow coming out of the glass on this one. The head coats the top of the beer heavily, almost like a lid waiting to be popped. The smell is so full of grapefruit and citrus is incredible. Very nice sweetness in the back too. This is my favorite taste in the world. Lovely hop oil provides a strong bitter citrus, but right behind that is sweetness from the honey that is brewed in this one. This has a great sticky mouthfeel, but goes down easy. Best drinkability of any 9% and above I've ever tasted. Amazing beer."
"In fairness to this beer, I did try it 2 months after it was bottled. I look forward to trying one of these when the 2010 batch is first released. I have a feeling the smell and taste scores will probably go higher."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"If you get the opportunity, try this beer on cask! It's a completely different experience and puts it in the ranks of PtE and PtY, maybe even better. Of course, if PtE or PtY were on cask...."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a IIPA, but the beer is okay in the drinkability aspect. Since the mouthfeel is a bit thin, the beer is a bit too watery, which takes away from the awesome flavour of the beer."
"What a masterpiece of a beer!"
"And by the way drizzam, nice ride this morning through the icy winter wind. Brr!"
"D - This one may not be considered drinkable by everybody but for hop lovers it's a very enjoyable ale. Definitely worth having again even though it's a bit pricey."
"As noted in the taste section, I was quite wowed by this beer. I thought it was going to be a big ol' hop-bomb... but it turns out it isn't nearly as harsh as I expected - in fact it's nowhere near what I expected. An IIPA of incredible balance and utmost flavor. Delicious!!"
"Drinkability - This is a tasty selection from Bells. The $15 for a sixer seemed a little high at first, but you get what you pay for. 10% ABV will preclude this from being a session brew, but it is quite the tasty number when taken in moderation. Very impressed!"
"Notes: BJCP style guidelines for an Imperial IPA inform me that this is a """showcase for hops", and I have to agree. Never before, however, have I had hops that have been showcased with this much finesse and beauty. Don't get me wrong, this is still an Imperial IPA that can compete with the best of them in terms of bitterness, but Bell's Hopslam Ale also has enough of a sweetness and smoothness to keep me coming back for bottle after bottle. For a huge malt fan like me, that's saying quite a lot."
"Thanks a lot TATURBO for this great brew!"
"This is a great Double I.P.A. in my opinion, the touch of honey gives it a great balance. I drank this one straight out of the bottle as i was too anxious to try after all the good things i've heard about it. I was a bit underwhelmed by it though. It didn't excite my tongue as much as it excited me to try it. It was extremely hoppy but didn't give me the west coast grapefruity and piney taste that i love. It may be a little too syrupy (too malty) for my taste. I have definately had better double IPA's, But overall i was very pleased with it and didn't have a problem finishing the case off with a few buddies."
"d - yes please! 10%ABV is well hidden."
"D - Very smooth and enjoyable, and the alcohol remains very well-hidden throughout. Due to the fact that it's not available in Texas, I was forced to drink a less-than-fresh bottle that I acquired on eBay. It's very good, but I'm interested to see what it's like fresh. As it is right now though, it's insanely drinkable. I love it!!!"
"Well made, well done, and apply named beer, enough said."
"Anyone who loves IPAs must seek this one out. I'll take this any day over the SoCal bitter-bombs that taste like condensed hop oil. I'd still put the Russian River Pliney's above this but it's up there with the best"
"I've had more """drinkable""" Hopslams in the past, but that was probably because it was served at too cold of a temperature. You can really feel the 10% ABV at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The strong alcohol flavor is the only thing that is compelling me to deduct a couple of points for drinkability, but it's making a good argument. But, oh! Those sweet, sweet pineapples! I love it!"
"D- Good drinkability. The ABV is 10% so only a few can be pounded in a sitting."
"D - I had to review this one again with an uber-fresh bottle. This beer is just straight-up awesome. I could pound this like a 3% session ale until I would up passed out on the floor for underestimating this beast of a DIPA. World-class."
"Very interesting and delicious double. The aroma was very citrusy and you could even smell the sweetness before tasting. While drinking, you are hit with all of the hop flavor right away, but because of the added sweetness, the bitterness at the end is much less than you would expect from the up front taste. Probably not the best beer to drink multiples of, but great for sipping and great overall."
"drinkability: really strong double and i will have it again. Unsure if I could have multis becaus eof the sweetness"
"Big thanks to psychohops bob for sending me this as an extra. I love the label. Pours a brilliant orange with a frothy egg-white head. Smell is strong of grapefruit and pine. It's hard to sense much else until halfway through the glass at which point hints of sweetness can be slightly detected. At first the taste is almost entirely masked by a vigorous carbonation. However once the beer has calmed down and your tounge acclimated, the taste is grapefruit up front fading to a lingering, strong pine. Traces of the sweet honey show itself but it's never in control of the taste. Good beer."
"D: Again, with the alcohol being fairly hidden, I would bet that you could put a couple of these down at a time. But for me, at $6 for a 12 oz. glass, just not worth it."
"As a relatively new member of the craft beer scene, I've tried to tell myself to not get sucked into the hype surrounding certain beers, and I feel I've done a pretty good job of that so far. HopSlam is one I was slightly worried about. However, this beer blows any expectations I had of it out of the water. Truly one of the finest beers I've ever tasted."
"This is a very drinkable IIPA for sure, not my favorite style but this is IIPA that I would go back to."
"A hazy amber color with a very nice white fuzz cap and decent lacing. The aroma is heavy flowery hops with some sweet malt hiding in the background. The flavor confirms the intense floral hops but a few mouthfuls eventually reveal the attempt to balance this brew with a touch of brown sugar and salty malt. Full bodied and lightly carbonated. I don't see this as a session beer with such thick constitution and heavy hops. But this a quality hop concoction. This was pretty heavy handed in the hops so it might take a couple tries to entirely warm up to it, a price I am happy to pay. Don't miss giving it a try!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. The taste isn't as hoppy as the smell would make you think, but it's still delicious."
"Drinkability, well for a 10% abv beer I can't believe the glass is dissapearing so fast. This is awesomely drinkable and highly recomended. A marvelously brewed beer,I think I'm in love with hops again!"
"d- I could drink this beer till I am completely stupid. Like I keep saying I can't believe that this beer is 10%. IMHO it is the best tasting DIPA on the market for drinkability."
"D: Easy to drink 10%. I could down this stuff..."
"D-One of the few 10% session beers out there. I could drink this till I became comatose! What more do I need to say?"
"D - The tartness can really turn people off of this. I'm not a big of it myself, but the sweetness and hops make up for it."
"Overall, I think it's a hyped up beer and I definitely don't think it's worth the money. I also definitely don't think it lives up to the name """Hopslam"""."
"Good amber color that even had my Kalik/Corona drinking dad impressed and wanting to try it. This is definitely a hop-head beer, so I am quite happy with it. However, I think that although Hopslam gets massive hype (and is deserving of most of it) I can't escape the thought that there are a ton of west coast IPAs in this class, most notably similar is Green Flash West Coast. Still a great beer, easy drinking for the ABV, and satisfies my hop cravings."
"D: It's an easy to drink 10% abv, but it's still a big beer and you feel that to some extent. On the other hand, it has a wonderful and complex flavor that makes you want to keep coming back for more."
"A slight burn on the finish from the 10% but overall a very easy drinking and hop flavorful beer."
"this is a full bodied ipa, and it is perfectly carbonated and smooth going down. i could drink this stuff all night, but i would rather drink it all day in the beautiful sun next to a beautiful garden... that is what this beer reminds me of."
"This is not an overly complex beer, but it is executed I think almost as well as it could be. I really super enjoyed drinking this; I had it with homemade linguine and white clam sauce, and it paired really well (despite the fact that I know nothing about pairing). It is crisp, with a good body but not heavy, a nice palate transition and overall just a great feel to it."
"The sight is exceptional, the smell is as well, but the taste is, well, nada mucho. The only thing truly redeeming this beer from total disappointment is how I feel from its 10% ABV. That makes me rather feel rather benign. And similar to alex3891's review, I too am trying to understand how this beer received the ratings it did. Did he and I drink a bad batch or something?"
"Well, this is good and all. The hype was so overwhelming, though. For a beer that costs this much, I feel like I should be getting something a bit more special. 90 Minute is a better value, and a better beer, imo. If I need to get this within a few weeks to fully enjoy it, that kind of sucks. Can I drink it? For sure. I'm underwhelmed, but in the minority. I don't doubt that it was better fresher, but it sure seems to have aged poorly."
"One of the best beers I have ever had the privilege of partaking. A stunning offering from Bell's- citrusy, pineapple, honey. Brilliant, blissful, simply put - Beer at its best. Definitely a good choice on tap, if available. Brings out the aromas and flavors that much more. Perfection!"
"D: This is 10%? Really? It sure doesn't feel like it. Anyway, this is undoubtedly a hophead's delight. I really wish Bell's would make this a year-round offering."
"Drinkability: At 10.0% abv, this one's (of course) not one to take lightly, but no need for me to tell you that - the flavors make that known easily enough. One of the classics, and deservedly - it's a tasty, aromatic hop monster, surprisingly quaffable, gorgeous, and a delight to the senses. Try it."
"D - Extremely drinkable. After hearing so much about this beer on BA I was afraid it might have been over-hyped. It is a great beer worth seeking out, I would trade for/ buy this again."
"Hopslam has a slammin' hoppy and piney aroma that smelled very sweet and fresh. I poured from a chilled bottle to glass which left a nice 1 ½ head. The color was a slight cloudy golden honey. It had a very complex body full of hoppy flavor with a twist of sweetness. Despite all the hop flavor and aroma it was not too overwhelming. If you are a hop fan then you will thoroughly enjoy this beer, as I did."
"Now were talking. This is my kind of beer. It had a very rich color and I could immediately smell the hops when it was placed before me. For having such a high ABV I was concerned this might be sweeter than I like, but the people at Bell's have loaded up on the hop goodness!"
"Simply put, this is a phenomenal example of an IIPA. Honestly, I can only think of one IIPA that I'd put ahead of this, but I'm not going to mention it's name out of respect for the Hopslam. Well done."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer. I've read much about Hopslam, but have not yet had the opportunity to try it. Now that I have, I can say the reviews are correct. This is a great beer and one I'm looking forward to having again."
"overall - Truly an experience in of itself. I'm so glad I got a chance to taste this gem. I was impressed by the masterful hoppyness, but I was even more impressed by how well the alcohol is masked. Even if you don't like IPA's (I'm not a fan myself), you owe it to yourself to try this destroyer of worlds."
"this beer has definetely lost something. i remember it being hoppier and therefore better balanced at EBF. The thick mouthfeel combined with subdued hops makes this brew slightly syrupy."
"Awesome beer!"
"Terrifically brewed beer, this is one of the ones you keep going back to year after year,"
"D: So easy to drink, you forget just how much a six pack would cost! Still not sure just what I'd do to get ahold of some more...."
"Just had this on cask at Rustico last night for their Glassware Giveaway event. Poured with no head, and was a hazy brushed gold color. Smelled fantastic. Ultra fresh hops, super clean, pineapple dominates, but also hints of pine and sour apple, solid honey sweetness. Taste is along the same lines as the smell. Definitely pure and clean hops, but not the exact flavor I enjoy best in a 2IPA. That's what kills this beer vs the hype for me. It's brewed excellently and tastes great, but just isn't my favorite flavor. Sweet honey malt helps balance the bitterness and makes it easier to drink, but it's still more of a sipping beer. Body was a little thick, but not as much as I was expecting from the cask. Basically no carbonation, and lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is nicely hidden, almost too well. Not sure if cask is worth the hype over regular tap? Overall, this was a pleasure to drink, but still not my favorite beer in the world."
"Cask Hopslam pours a suffuse orange with a mild haze and not much head, surprisingly so. That, though, is the only disappointing about this beer. On the nose, there's a brilliant hop character, prominent and complex with pine and tropical fruit - pineapple, orange, mango. Just brilliant. On the palate, this beer is just brilliant. All the hops come through spectacularly. Light in body with a bit of sweetness that balances the hops really well, this beer is a treat. The cask conditioning of this beer really takes it to another level with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. And the drinkability? My first pint lasted 10 minutes."
"This is my first experience with Hopslam and to be honest, with all of the build up and rave reviews on message boards and from word of mouth, I was underwhelmed by this one. I am not saying that this is a bad beer by no stretch of the imagination. I am just saying that I felt that it didn't live up to the hype that is hovering around this one. The aromas that this one gives off is a reason to fall in love with this beer. It is by and far the best smelling beer that I have had the privilege of experienced. There are other double/imperial IPA's that I would choose over this one despite the incredible nose that this creates."
"So busy trying to recover some points from not catching the flavors right away that I drank all my HopSlam. Damn!"
"The freshness of the hop flavor is amazing. I can imagine what this beer is like freshly tapped. Once again, the freshness of the hops overwhelms the distinct """types""" of hop flavors. The thickness of the mouthfeel continuously remind you that this is a sipper."
"Very expensive six pack of this stuff. I think it may be well worth it, however. It's a beautiful honey-golden color with a thick dark white head that sticks to the glass the whole way down. It reeks of floral hops and citrus in the best possible way. A little sweetness and alcohol in the smell as well. The taste is remarkabley smooth considering the alcohol content. Grapefruity, hoppy, pine tree, and a touch of sweetness come together to form the best IPA I've ever had. Its medium body and texture is close to perfect and it's quite easy to drink. This may be the best beer I've ever had."
"Hey, my 50th review! Not a bad choice for my 50th."
"Overall, disappointed in this one. Granted, this one isn't quite fresh - but the big flavors seemed a bit disjointed, and lacking in complexity and subtlety. The huge sweetness coupled with the piney astringency was a bit much in this one. Would have like for the massive sweetness to have been toned down just a bit."
"D- Exceptional drinkability for a beer of this style. I am going to enjoy my six pack while it lasts but at $16 a sixer I will not be drinking this on a regular basis, even though I would really like to. Get it, drink it, love it."
"D - Its 10%, but maybe good for 2. Would revisit this one especially since its once a year."
"Hopslam is a great beer but it makes my wallet ache. I'm more partial to regular IPA's so I'd probably only buy this once a year. I would like to try it on tap however."
"Hopslam has an extremely floral nose and taste. As one the best DIPAs I've had, I highly recommend it. However, at 10% ABV it's tough for me to drink more than two. Note: that this is one of Bells seasonal beers and is only available for a short time beginning in early January."
"This is great. Bells puts out some good brews, that's for sure."
"Cheers to Bell's with this one! I was pretty underwhelmed by Two Hearted, but Hopslam is amazing."
"Pours a clear bright light gold with a small mostly white head. Smells only of thick citrusy hops that is reminiscent of a west coast hop bomb. First sip is all grapefruit. It is thick and strong with the flavor of Indian River grapefruit upfront and dominating. A bitter finish compliments well as the mouth puckering hop quality is so very loved."
"Nice beer! I may have to rethink my stance on IPA's and DIPA's."
"d: i think that different years of this beer must be quite different; i found this to have a bitter twinge but overall it really favred the sweeter hop flavors all though there was ample skunk and zest; definitely worth picking up at the store"
"Drink it! If you can find it! 10% hoppy goodness!!"
"Tried this for the first time. A 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass. It pours a darker goldish brown with a fairly small head, no bigger than 1 finger. The smell is very citrusy with a hint of pine needles. Upon the first sip, the beer is fairly bitter, and very citrusy and grassy as the smell would foreshadow. It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way. Overall, what a fantastic brew! I will definitely be back for more of these, when I have the money for them! Only wish they were cheaper!"
"D - For one that is not yet fully into IPA's, this is definitely one to drink to enjoy the style."
"In terms of drinkability, this is a one, maybe two, a night beer."
"I am impressed. Thoroughly."
"Overall, this is one delicious beer. I don't consider myself a """hop-head", but I do consider this one to be a winner."
"Basically, if it's available, drink it and enjoy it. You won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability is dangerous, since this beer drinks so easily, yet is so powerful and flavorful. Reccommended if you are into alot of hop flavor."
"this is one of the best beers for a beer lover to drink. it has everything one would want in a craft brew. for starters, the wonderful smell hopslam puts out. once you are lucky enough to taste it, the hops are definitely there, the smell and flavor follow all the way down into your stomach. with the high abv. i would possibly expect a less drinkable beer but quite contrary this beer tastes excellent and i would drink it all the time if i could"
"2009 vintage poured a very nice gold color with an inch thick head. This has to be one of the best smelling IIPA's around with a strong fruit and citrus background. The alcohol is well hidden at first sip and the hops dominate on the way down. This beer is deadly but one of my personal favorites. Very highly recommended if you can find it fresh."
"D- A tasty brew and if not for the high abv i could pound a few of these back buti would be sloshed after 3. A nice beer to sit back and sip and enjoy during a movie night."
"For me, what sets this DIPA apart from the rest is the malt balance (just enough) and mouthfeel (light). It's a very easy to drink DIPA."
"One of the absolute most beautifully crafted beers available today, the smell alone is enough to make a case for this being the best thing in the world. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky that belies the bitterness and is further offset by the honey sweetness added into this beer, which while it adds an interesting element to the beer, takes a bit away from the overall hop experience. Still though, this is one of the most astounding beers I've ever had the pleasure to cross my palate. And drinks far far lower than the 10% would ever indicate, be careful or you could see a six pack of this disappear in a night, even without a friend."
"D: Very enjoyable. Although full of hops, it never became overly bitter. I liked the unique hint of honey that offset the hops. There is a definite alsohol presence, but never overwhelming. I would have given the drinkability a five if not for the 10% alcohol content that started to creep up on me."
"I wish I could've gotten my hands on it back in January, but more than happy to have it now."
"pours a nice honey color without much of a head. it doesn't have a lot of carbonation, and the small head dissipates quickly, sort of anti-IPA of it. smell is great, has a wonderful piney hop aroma to it, maybe even a hint of mango to it, according to my fiancee. taste is really good, has a distinct bitterness to it of course but also has a strange mild maltiness to it, the higher alcohol content definitely warms me up. we just started to get bells in this area so i look forward to trying their other beers."
"Overall Impression: This is a fine beer that provides a wonderful balance between sweetness and boisterous hop character. The hops are definitely showcased which is nice to see in an IIPA. Yet, the induction of honey provides a level of depth and mouthfeel that adds to the complexity of the beer without taking away from the pungent hop character. This is without a doubt my favorite IIPA to date and I would recommend it to any beer lover, hop head or not, simply because of the fine craftsmanship that must be involved in creating such a fine product."
"Recommended for anyone who likes a powerful hop punch up front, but a smooth, honey-ale finish."
" All in all this is an outstanding beer. Bell's hasn't let me down yet, and this one doesn't disappoint either. I'm glad I got a case so I can cellar some of this for a rainy day! So does this beer live up to the hype? In my opinion yes without question."
"Wow... this was great. I had this one at Stable in St. Louis and it did not dissappoint. I have had out of a bottle and on tap. This, in my opinion was not too different. Like any beer out of a cask it was less carbonated, which is very good, and the flavor were more prevelant. Definitely had the grapefruit hop, and the honey finish on the end. I was lucky enough to get in on the ass end of the cask and the pour, and I do mean pour as the spout had been removed at that point, was like a blond mud. It was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and hope to get the same next year."
"D: This is 10% ABV?? Apart from the alcohol in the smell, this beer hides the alcohol really well."
"EDITED after drinking a 9 day old bottle. I must say that she comes together much better. Still a little high on the sweetness and alcohol both, but it is a much more drinkable brew. Still not a 4.4 beer though. Adjusted score accordingly."
"Drinkablitiy is a little on the low end, cause I need to be able to function after...10%! Are you kidding???"
"Served up on tap at Macnivens in Indianapolis in proper glassware (a snifter with the bells logo). Sadly, a smokie environ impaired an already weak sniffer, but in between whaffs, the citusy hops came through. A fairly clear golden color with nairy a hint of carb but sticky lace clings to the glass throughout. Nice hop bite yet creamy mouthfeel. The hops are piney yet the citrusy aspect and smooth mouthfeel make for a harmonic convergence of flavor. That was lame, but its accurate. This is a solid DIPA and worthy of all the hype from my fellow BA's. I enjoyed it so much, I smuggled four bottles in me luggage after buying some at a local packie."
"There are many other DIPA's on the same level that are far more accessible. Still, this beer delivers unique hop complexities that should not be passed up...even if you can only grab a couple per year."
"overall - the cask version destroys the bottle and draft. this was very smooth, there was no carbonation to add to the bite so this was HIGHLY drinkable. i am very privileged to have had this from a cask."
"Poured from 12oz bottle batch #8911 into Bell's pint glass. Pours a light amber golden color with a half finger of frothy head that leaves gobs of retention on the sides of the glass. Smell is all grapefruit. I don't know how else to describe it but grapefruit citrus smell with maybe a hint of biscuitlike malt hidden deep. Taste is citrus hops up front(grapefruit, hints of banana and orange peel) followed seemlessly by smooth biscuitlike malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and not as dry as most DIPAs are. Drinkability is amazing for such a high ABV beer. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and kind of scary this could be so easy drinking. This is the best DIPA I've ever had, ever. This beer deserves a perfect 5. If this were available year round I'd stop trying new beers and this is all I would drink(at least for this style). In my opinion a perfect DIPA."
"I felt fortunate to have this on cask, apparently only three will be served in a two state region and this happened to be just down the street; complete with a representative from Bell's to swing the mallet! A nice touch with Bell's tulip glass as well."
"Drinkability: Not my all-time favorite DIPA, but I'm really curious to see how these age over time. I may stick them in a closet and try one again in six months or so."
"This beer achieves a rare feat: being a balanced hop bomb. Yes, the hops are very much running the show, but I appreciated the strong malt character, which kept things from getting too crazy. A great brew and certainly deserving of MOST of the praise it gets."
"Drinkability is limited by the intesity of flavor and the high abv. A great beer, but I can't really drink two in one sitting."
"I agree that this is better on tap but still an iconic brew that every hop lover needs to at least try."
"A balanced beer that has a great deal of sweetness for the style. The high ABV is very well concealed. Drinks like an IPA, missing the aggressive nature I would expect from a DIPA. This does not taste like a hop monster or a 'big' beer. I guess I had expected something more from Bell's...."
"So glad I finally got a chance to try me some hopslam, not as good as Pliny but still damn good"
"D- despite the high ABV. THis is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself having 4 to 6 in one session."
"Tried this for the first time today. A 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass. It pours a darker goldish brown with a fairly small head, no bigger than 1 finger. The smell is very citrusy with a hint of pine needles. Upon the first sip, the beer is fairly bitter, and very citrusy and grassy as the smell would foreshadow. It goes down extremely well, better than I thought it would. The alcohol is there, but hidden very well for the 10% ABV. Mouthfeel is prtty bitter and acidy, in a good way. Overall, what a fantastic brew! I will definitely be back for more of these, when I have the money for them! Only wish they were cheaper!"
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I think the only thing that keeps me from rating it a 5 in drinkability is that I feel my palate is battered after one and the second does not get the deserving credit. Overall, an amazing beer."
"Finally had this one on tap at Whistle Binkies on the Lake. Small head on tap, but still had some decent lacing. Smell was just as good as from the bottle. Nothing pure hop bliss. Pine and citrus all the way. Taste? Well, what can I say? It's delicious. So much orange, grapefruit, and various citrus flavors backed up by some pine resin and a very solid, very sweet backbone. Do I like it better on tap? Well, probably not. The first time I had it out of the bottle (which my bottle review implies) was just magical. I can't see that first experience being topped. The only difference was lighter carbonation from the tap than from the bottle. Still fantastic, nonetheless. Appearance and a bit of aroma is the only thing lacking on tap compared to from the bottle."
"D - Very drinkable even considering the abv."
"D - This is quite a DIPA, very tasty and drinkable, but beware of the ABV kick, you will not taste it at all, but this a great beer and another winner from Bell's"
"Overall - Outstanding!!! I can really taste the raw honey in this brew. Just the right amount of everything. Full in flavor but not overly sweet, nor bitter, nor carbonated. Great looking, smelling, and tasting. I wish it wasn't 10% alcohol because I really would like to have more than two in a session ; )"
"This beer poured a beautiful golden amber with a finger or two of head. Fluffy and light like whipped butter atop the amber candy below. The smell isn't as pungent as I expected, but is complex with a hint of the hoppy bitterness to come. The flavor is quite nice, and quite well rounded. Hops up front with a hint of the honey sweetness are followed by a nice hoppy bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing. This will be an excellent hot day beer and a very nice example of what I like in a DIPA. Worth the too much I paid for it."
"Drinkability - Great drinkability for a beer of this strength, the alcohol is well-masked."
"D: Too many of these and I'd get slammed drunk. Really enjoy this beer and will seek it out, probably on tap more than trying to purchase a 6 pack. Great IPA, just have a slight aversion to the cloying aftertaste."
"Tried this beer for the first time this year at D's Six Pax and Dogz in Pittsburgh, I was thrilled to find it there on tap. Arrived at the table a beautiful golden orange with nice lacing on the pint glass. The nose is so tremendous, I just had to share it with those sitting at the table with me, and all agreed - very hoppy and floral, with notes of fruit, especially pineapple. The taste didn't disappoint, with a great deal of fruity hops on the tongue right off the bat. Finishes off so smoothly that you'd never know about the high ABV. Feels smooth and creamy in the mouth, extreme drinkability - enough so that I immediately went next door to buy a whole case for the fridge. Always look forward to the release of this beer."
"Had this beer for the first time on tap at """Teresa's Next Door""" in Wayne PA. It was part of their Double IPA day. It was poured into a 12 oz. goblet. The color was a deep reddish amber color with about an inch head. The nose was strong of hops and fruits. The taste was outstanding and tastes as good as it smells. It is often compared to Russian River's Pliny the Elder but Bells has been more consistent with flavor and appearance. The drink ability was excellent and I ended up having 3 glasses :). A highly recommended double IPA!"
"Notes: This just may be the best DIPA that I've ever had the pleasure of drinking! I would stock up on this if I were in their distribution channels, for sure. In terms of DIPA's, they don't get any better than this. The sheer, unbridled brilliance that Hopslam delivers is absolutely amazing! Highly recommended"
"D - This exceptional beer was a delight to have on cask. I could drink this beer every day, but definitely not all day."
"Overall: This is my favorite IPA at the moment. The pineapple is really awesome. I would do anything to see Bell's distribute to MA."
"Now, before I get slammed from other BAs, remember this review is my opinion and not any one elses. I love bitter IPAs and this was not that bitter. Good at best. Will I seek this out? No, especially since I can get better IPAs at a much lower price. Just average in my book."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass. Bright clear golden orange, 1""" frothy bone white head. Sticky spotty lacing remains along with a thick foamy cap of head. Aroma is sweet floral honey, earthy piney orangey citrus. Taste is outstanding, sweet floral honey up front, bitter grapefruit in the back, long bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, finish is long and astringent. A glorious beer. So easy to drink if you love the hops."
"It is hard to believe that this brew can be 10.2% alcohol. It is masterfully balanced and easy to drink. The aroma and feel are so wonderful that you can keep drinking. BE CAREFUL, it will sneak up on you because the alcohol is so """disguised""" by the artistry within."
"I liked the flavor and found it extremely balanced and drinkable for such a big IPA, but I thought it was a bit underwhelming overall. I expected it to have a bit more pop to it and definitely more hops. Very good, but I was expecting exceptional, and especially a bit underwhelming with the very high price."
"I am gonna have to get this again!"
"Found the draft to be better than the bottle because it seemed a little smoother. you would never know it was a 10%er"
"Fantastic beer. A real pleasure to sample (and for my first review)!"
"D - I didn't know this was a 10% abv beer until I found it here to review I don't think I've had a beer with this abv that was so drinkable I could have easily drank a few bottles without knowing better if I had them definitely worth seeking out to try"
"Drinkability - a bit sweeter than I normally prefer but a fine ale nonetheless. An interesting take on the DIPA style."
"EVERY YEAR I LOOK FORWORD TO THIS BEER. ANY TIME ONE BOTTLE HAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOPS THAT SIX CASES OF BUD DOES THAT IS A GOOD BEER. THIS YEARS HAS A SOFT PINE AROMA WITH A HINT OF HONEY. THE TASTE HAS A RICH GRAPEFRUIT AND ACIDIC FLAVOR. IT HAS A HAZY APPERANCE IN THE GLASS, BUT THE TASTE IS SMOOTH."
"Overall, I don't like the grassy-type flavor of these hops. I am a west coast hop kinda guy and these are not west coast hops. Too bitter and grassy for me in flavor. Smell is very nice though, probably the best thing about this beer."
"Very drinkable. i could drink this until i couldn't stand anymore. If i wasn't a broke college kid, i might drink this, and only this from January-February."
"D- Probably as drinkable as you can get in a 10% DIPA...balance is outstanding, but can be dangerous in this beer"
" Overall a very drinkable beer. I could drink this brew all night if it wasn't for the high ABV. Just A shame it's only a seasonal offering."
"Ashleys in Ann Arbor, on tap. Great beer, taste smell and eveything else. On thing is for sure if that it's got a very green flavor, all those good hops. Currently I'm sitting in the bar typing this review and let me tell you""" this is a serious brew"""(Bigal723)."
"Very tasty, I enjoyed this."
"What's stopping Bell's from making its way West? Too much competition for Stone and RR? ;)"
"From what I understand Hopslam is a pretty expensive beer. I wouldn't drop $18 on a 6 pack...but then again there are a lot of AMAZING IIPA's out in the Pacific NW."
"D- Outstanding, the balance and smoothness that the honey provides is wonderful, you can session these if you can take it."
"D: ABV alone may limit drinkability, but can't go wrong with flavor and balance."
"Enjoyed with tacos. Poured with an enormous head that disappated to minimal lacing. Insanely floral aromas of pine, citrus, bicsuit, grapefruit and honey syrup. The tongue is assailed with bitter grapefruit and hop, hemp oil goodness with the touch of honey sugar kicking in. The mouthfeel is oily yet light at the same time. The 10% is hidden well here, extremely drinkable, extremely good, wowsa!! HopSlam is everything right with Humulus Lupulis. This is not a basher type DIPA, more finesse here which is exactly what I look for in this style."
"D 5.0 - A very drink-able hop tongue splitter. I could drink these things all day, but you have to be very careful of the 10% ABV! I dig the grapefruit aromas and tastes."
"Overall, very impressive beer. Most balanced, drinkable hop-head brew I've had the pleasure of tasting. Unlike Ruination (the hoppiest beer I've had so far), very sessionable and approachable, even for those new to micros."
"my bottom line: There's a good reason why so many people get so excited when this stuff is released every year."
"This is the quintessentail imperial IPA. A nice golden color poured into a Bell's snifter. A big hop nose that doesn't over whelm you. This is a big IPA but it drinks very smooth. It does not have an over the top IPA taste it comes across almost creamy with a very subtle bitterness. There are a lot of breweries that go for big IPA's but this is the most drinkable and I can't think of another beer in the midwest that people anticipate and love more then Hop Slam."
"D- As long as Bell's has this in production, I'll be a loyal follower. It's really enjoyable to drink. Caveat being as long as the price doesn't go up $3 more next year"
"Ale was poured into a pint glass. At first I noticed how little carbonation emanated from the beer as I poured it. A small white head appeared which quickly laced away. The beer is a golden color with some orange highlights....Smells strongly of hops with some mild spice and honey. Taste's very powerfully of hops, rather bitter, but not unpleasant. Slightly sweet as well, from the honey along with some clove. This beer is not as resiny as many other strongly hopped beers, which leaves a very pleasant mouth feel."
"Overall impression is that my mouth is enormously happy every time I take a sip of this amazing IPA. I can assure you that it lives up to all the hype it's receiving, and I don't think it'd be too hard to say this is definitely my new favorite beer. The only drawback is its limited release, so get it fast and share it with a friend."
"Overall: The the mouth feel in the beer is medium body with carbonation and a bit of dryness. The finish is medium to light with some bitterness. This beer compared to a Stone Ruination, this big is its little sister. This beer is more like a big IPA, than a DIPA. Sorely disappointed, when I think of a DIPA is suppose to have strong intense hop flavor with a subtle malt backbone. This beer is no where near it. The hype to me is false. There is no persistent head which was miss dearly."
"Overall a very fine ale from Bell's. Defenitely one of the best mid west DIPAs, and probably in the top 10 or 15 in the nation/world. I like the honey presence aside from a slight thickness through the middle, but I really think it ads more to the beer than it takes away. Drinkability is defenitely where this one shines. A star in the Bell's line up for sure, defenitely would like to have regular access to this. Great beer."
"I had this beer shipped to me in New York from West Lakeview Liquors. Pours a deep orange color with a small white fizzy head. The smell got me excited for this one. I could tell I was in for a citrusy hops explosion. I totally got it. This is the citrusy DIPA from my dreams. If it gets better than this then I have yet to see it. Totally worth the shipping costs."
"Not quite the fantastic beer i remembered it to be but still damn tasty. Extremely well balanced and quite sessionable despite it's 10%. Yummy!"
"Overall- This is up there on my top 3 IPA's. This beer honestly has such a personal flavor to it that you will remember it's flavor long after you are done."
"Props to Bells on this complex brew!"
"Overall- lives up to the hype. This beer has all the attributes I seek in a great DIPA. This beer may have just outshined my previous DIPA king- Dogfish Head 90-Minute. Complex and delicious!"
"what a great beer. needs more credit. it tastes like liquid gold. needs to be a year round beer. i love it. what a great beer. this year tastes like grapefruit. with a golden color. the smell it wonderful. i would drink it over and over again. its a little spendy but worth every penny"
"Clean, hop-filled ale goes down easy. The 10% ABV well cloaked. Recent tasting of Victory Hop Wallop and DFH 90 minute completes the triumvirate with Bell's DIPA the clear favorite. If there is a better DIPA I haven't had the pleasure. Highly recommended."
"This is a very astringent version, less pineapple but more than the first I tried. The alcohol and hops don't play as well together this year."
"Thanks to icefisherman for the trade."
"Let this one get a few degrees warmer, soo tasty. This is all about the complexity and depth of the hop tastes and smells put together. Also had this one in a bottle, but I think I preferred the on tap version at Sturbs."
"Appearance is a beautiful orange, almost apple juice color, with light yellow highlights. Beautiful off-white head, that doesn't stick around for too long, but lacing does. The smell hit me like a punch in the face, if that could ever be considered a positive experience. Strong, unmistakable scent of fresh pineapple, with other citrusy highlights in the background. Taste wise, this is a phenomenal IIPA. It claims to be """biting and bitter""" but this is balanced so well that the most harsh IPA critic would even enjoy this brew. It's hard for me to discern the initial flavor, but afterwards you get a nice kick of hops all the way down. So so good. This one is creamy, smooth, tasty, well balanced, and perfectly crafted. Kudos to Bells Brewery, those gents are alright. Keep these coming."
"I've heard a lot of great things about this beer so I was excited to try it. Ended up picking it up while on a trip to see a friend. It poured a hazy orangish, light amber, off gold color. Had about a one finger head that faded not to long after pouring. The smell is great! Very hoppy and piney. After taking a sip the mouthfeel is good, not light at all but not heavy just right really. The taste is very sweet because of the honey and the hops stand out nicely, piiney and a bit citrusy. The flavor is very good. With a 10% ABV it's hidden very well making this beer very very drinkable. I could easily drink these! In the end I'm glad I went out of my way to grab a six pack of Hopslam up. Very well worth the $17 I paid for it."
"HopSlam is currently in my top five, and probably won't be going anywhere for a while."
"Nice substance to the mouthfeel- I can't comprehend that this is 10%. Extremely drinkable- the alcohol never crossed my mind once. The hop flavors did a great job to cover this up. Overall this beer was not really what I was expecting, but its delicious regardless. A must for IPA and hop fans."
"D: Even though it's a 10% I could have a few of these at a time. I want more, putting the order in now :)"
"Maybe just TOO EXTREME for my taste."
"Overall, a very solid beer. I definitely wouldn't call it my favorite DIPA, but it is one of the most quirky beers I've had in a while and they pull it off."
"Pours a nice, if light, copper color, with some good initial head (quickly fading) and a wee bit of lacing. Nice strong hoppy scent, floral and citrus (extreme amounts of grapefruit, which I honestly don't care for as a melon). Nice deep hoppy taste from beginning to end, although the pine and the grapefruit battle a bit, with the grapefruit winning out. Goes down fine for a higher ABV beer, although there's a little roughness in it. A nice double IPA, there are better and worse."
"Wow, this is phenomenal, and dangerously drinkable. This is a great beer, and another great one from Bell's. The best IPA I've ever had for sure."
"Very good DIPA. Would like to find some bottles of this and compare to draft."
"d: again, I could drink a lot of these if they didn't get you so whacked"
"D: Just average. I bought a 6 pack last year, and thought it was good, not great. I went for the single bottle this year, and am glad I didn't spend the extra $12. Was not as pleasing as many others in the top 100 IMO."
"Picked up in a trade with sry23."
"A nice double IPA done spot-on in the San Diego style. My only gripe is the ABV-- you can often taste and smell the alcohol. If this was attenuated to the same degree and 8%, I think it would be even better. Still, this would be a regular if it was available around here. Thanks to Sanford for the free sample."
"Comment: An ideal imperial IPA. Will convert hop skeptics, and thrill hopheads."
"Worth every ounce of effort it took me to get a case of this... its going to take some will power to keep a bottle for about 9 months..."
"Pours a clear copper color with a pretty nice slightly off-white head that has awesome retention and leaves great lacing. The aroma is fresh, pungent, American hops. The taste has its own hop blast but it is matched with a nice maltiness. It is one of the piney-est beers I have ever had and has considerable bitterness. It feels much lighter in the mouth than its relative strength. Its got a medium body and finishes smoothly. Awesome beer!"
"This is definitely one of ,if not my, favorite beers. Extremely enjoyable and highly drinkable. Its not for the weak palate, this baby is a hop head's Kool Aid. It beats your tastebuds into submission and I continued to ask for more. I so hate to give a beer a perfect rating, but in my limited knowledge, this is as close to perfection as I have ever been."
"This beer tastes like a grapefruit. It's very good. It's golden brown, and it has a citrusy grapefruit smell. Hopslam tastes much different than I thought it would but its a good thing. I may have to edit this review when I am a bit more sober. Bells brewery is awesome. Try this beer....you will not regret it. It's worth every penny"
"Perfection in a bottle. This brew pours a radiant yellow orange liquid, floating a respectable head. Insane lacing sticks to the glass. Smell is a sweet citrusy pine aroma. Grapefruit and lemons. Taste is a tart citrus hop attack balanced quite perfectly by asugary honey note. This beer is perfect. 10% drinks like 5%. After every sip, my mouth was left wanting another. The bar has been set, this is the perfect DIPA for the citrus hop fiend."
"Drinkablitly is tricky. At 10%, I can't detect even a hint of the alcohol in the flavor. None. I can, however, detect it all up in my business after a couple glasses. On the other hand, the price is ballooning something fierce. I paid $14 (after tax) for the stuff last year. This year, it's $17.99 (before tax). I lucked out. The store at which I purchased it sold it to me at cost due to the fact that I spend a lot of money there, despite being employed by a competing liquor store. The damage was $13.30. Not bad, but who's to say it won't be over $20 next year? Aw, who am I kidding? I'd fucking pay it. Hopslam is a once-a-year treat."
"Great beer Larry. One of my more favorite offerings despite it's placement on the release calendar."
"average drinkability."
"Finally picked up one of these. Poured from a bottle. Pours a nice thick offwhite head. A dark golden color. The smell is just wonderful, sweet citrisy scent. First, taste of sweet hops, then a wonderfull hit hop. Then a bit of warming sensation of the alcohol. Mouthfell good not too thick for this kind of beer. Overall a smooth great tasting beer but it will be a while till I buy another."
"Body was reasonably heavy and sticky, medium carbonation, drinkabale because of the good taste but very boozy."
"D: For such a big ass beer, this is highly drinkable. The look was the only let down this beer produces. That smell, taste, and feel is damned near perfect and makes this a fine beer that stands with and higher than most DIPA I have ever had. God this is good."
"Huge fan of this beer, grab it while you can and get it off tap if you can find it!"
"Drinkability: I'm convinced that this is an extremely exceptional beer. I now understand all the hype behind it. I don't know if I could justify paying the amount of money they want for it, but I honestly don't doubt that it is worth it. To those that can afford it, congratulations. I may have to pick up one or two more singles though before it disappears until next year. I'm a little concerned about the 10% ABV, so I definitely wouldn't drink more than one in an evening (but then again, I'm really a lightweight, so take that for what it's worth)."
"d 4-4.5 insanely drinkable for 10% abv! i haven't had many beers this strong, but this is easily the most drinkable of any over 9%, even of any over 8%, that i've experienced. the back of the bottle says this is a """biting, bitter, tongue bruiser of an ale.""" don't think i can agree. it's more a sinful, sticky, hop candy of a dessert."
"once again bells brings the thunder."
"I though Pliny was the best but I think we have a new king in the DIPA category."
"Reviewed out of a 12 oz. longneck bottle from the 2009 release and poured carefully into a 18oz. snifter. Translucent orange in color with a small head. Leaves ring of lacing on the glass. A surprisingly sweet smell for an IPA. The hops are only just detectable next to the grapefruit/honey aroma. Sweet on the nose and seems to oscillate between the sweetness of the honey and the bitterness of the hops. As you swallow, it slides smoothly down your throat and that sweet taste sets in for a few seconds, after which the hop taste takes over for good. This is one of the most flavor packed beers I have ever had, and I'm not just talking about hops! This is a perfectly balanced IPA on a level of greatness I didn't even think was possible. This will easily be one of my favorite brews of the year."
"Eric"
"D: it seems like most beers with 10% ABV ought to be considered """sippers"""...but not so much in this case..."
"Pours a crystal-clear light orange w/ as much head as you'd like(depending on pour strength). Head leaves as soon as it came, but the lace sticks around for the long haul. Smell is just pure citrus hops, just with deeper fruiter notes than we get here out west. Taste is nothing short of outstanding, If your like me; and in love w/these wet coast hop-bombs you don't want to miss a chance to get your hands on the mid-west's version of this style. Kinda reminds me of a double-dog, sans honey. Drinkability on this one's not very high because it will screw you up! Overall I'm impressed w/ this beer and stoked I got my grubby paws on it!"
"Overall: Very happy that this lived up to the hype! Not too thick (in comparison to Maharaja and Unearthly) Very drinkable for the alcohol content, the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. If you can get a trade for this It's worth it and if you're able to buy it, also worth the $15-18."
"Tastes likes hops, but in a pretty balanced way. The fruity sweetness works well with the bitterness of hops. I can pick out grapefruit, pine trees, pineapple and honey. Got a nice tang to it that makes this normally incredibly bitter style a nice refreshing quality to it. Very easy to drink for its abv and hop bomb qualities. Very nice brew, I'm not really that much of a hophead, but this is one I can easily enjoy. Wish it was cheaper."
"D: This is a huge find for me. This one really lives up to its hype. I think it's smoother than Pliny. Certainly a world class beer for its style. I have 5 left... Alcohol masked very well on the palette, but man does it creep up on you."
"So, the times being what they are, I couldn't justify dropping $18 for a sixer of a beer I'd never had, though I've heard good things. Now that I've had the opportunity to try it on draft, I might have drop the money for a sixer... and price a lot of places beforehand."
"Drinkability; I came in expecting a hop bomb or something akin to carbonated grapefruit pulp, but got a rather tasty brew. Shame it's so limited this year. Watch out for that alcohol content, it's a killer and a sneaky bastard."
"12 oz bottle poured clear golden into a snifter. Slight to no head but wow, intense hop grapefruit hits instantly. First sip.. amazing bright citrus flavor hopiness. What comes to mind is biting into a red grapefruit. Leaves with a silky smoothness with slight carbonation. Amazing drinkability for the ABV. Great beer to satisfy the needs of the most demanding hop head. (Wish this was a year round offering)"
"Open bottle and smell...mmmm...Hops, lots of hops. Looks gorgeous in my glass. Orange-ish, brown. And that smell...damn!! First taste, hoppy grapefruit. That's all I can think of. Very smooth for the 10% ABV. Mellowed by the honey, I'm guessing. This tastes better than I remembered from last year. As a Hop Guy...this is heaven. I highly recommend this beer. Even with the hefty $17.99/6pk price. Remember...doing the math it's almost the same as $11.99 4pk and $5.99 for a 22oz. Rationalizing is an art."
"Pours a clearish light copper with a two-finger head that left lace on the glass. A mix of hops and some sweet malts in the smell. Medium-bodied with a huge hop bite that goes down smooth and finishes clean (I'm not used to that in a DIPA). I kept hearing about grapefruit in this beer and there is definitely grapefruit notes coming from the hops, for a drying yet also semi-sweet sensation. It is rather noticeable in this beer and I haven't had a DIPA that quite tasted like this. And while this along with sweet malts made for an interesting taste, the grape feeling wore on me a little."
"This is scary drinkable for 10%! As in, pass out on the floor drinkable...extremely delicious brew..."
"Poured into my favorite mug, bright hazy orange, with a big fluffy head. Smells like citrus and grassy hops. Tastes the same but with a wonderful little bite of alcohol at the end. finishes sweet and goes down smooth. My only problem with this beer is that I cant drink it all night long, I just fall asleep."
"What a nice beer. I've been reading a lot of the hype this beer has generated & I can say it's worthy of the hype. I don't say that about too many beers, but this one lives up to the hype IMHO."
"D - This is about as drinkable as an DIPA gets. Not overly bitter, and the alcohol isn't overpowering. Very nice beer, though it would be hard for it to ever live up to the hype."
"D-A great DIPA. Suh-WEET! This beer has a smoothness to it that makes it a very enjoyable beer to consume and appreciate."
"Moderately carbonated which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. That combined with awesome flavor make this one highly drinkable. It would be a '5' on drinkability if not for the 10% ABV. That takes this one off the list of session beers."
"D = Very drinkable. Goes down smoothly. Strong enough that one at a sitting is fine, but I look forward to more of these on other occasions."
"I know it is expensive, but trust me it is worth every drop and you will wish you could drink this beer everyday. For a hop head there is nothing better."
"This beer definitely deserves all the hype and any hop fan should get their hands on it."
"Cheers!"
"D - A huge, yet quite drinkable beer. This is a very well balanced beer, which is quite a feat considering the huge loads of hop flavor and malt sweetness that had to be carefully kept in check. The flavor is wonderful, but the real star in the aroma which is nothing short of spectacular with an exceptional variety of hop aromas. Surprisingly, this beer more than lives up to the hype."
"A rockin DIPA, but a little over hyped if you ask me."
"D: this is excellent and makes for a nice treat on a cold winter day. The flavor of summer the warmth of a scotch(maybe not quite as much but you get the idea.)"
"Overall: Pretty east to drink, well balanced, but still far more hops than anything else going on in this beer. The alcohol taste not as detectable as you would think for 10% ABV... but you end up feeling it :)"
"D: I can't drink one of these slowly. I wish there was a little bit less alcohol because you pay the price if you don't respect he potency of this brew. If you are addicted to hops, this is a beer you have to try. I'm in love with this beer. Must... get... more..."
"12 oz bottle. A bright barely cloudy dark gold pour. Smallish white head. Very floral aroma, fresh hops with just a hint of honey and malt. Pretty straight forward very hoppy, but there is some sweet malt with the honey, and some citrus and apple. Finishes real clean, for those that like a hop belch, this will do it for you. Tastes like a really really good pale ale. I was expecting this to be just a bite in the rear bitter beer, but it was quite well balanced and dangerously drinkable. The most drinkable double I've had. Was not an earth shattering experience, but I'm glad I tried it. Not sure it was worth the 15 for the sixer, but hopefully I can trade some of this."
"After reading everythiny about this beer, both positive and negative, I finally decided to break down and buy a six pack. This is a very good Imperial IPA and even though I am not sure it totally lived up to the hype this is still a very good beer. To me the price is not a huge factor, I have had other Imperial IPA's with a similar price tag and found them to be just as good, if not better. It was a pleasure to drink this beer and if the price was a little better I would certainly get this again, but I think I can get similar or better stuff for a little less price. Definatley a great beer but just a hair out of my price range, especially for a sixer. Added to the fact that this is a seasonal offering it makes it less tempting to send that money."
"D: Hides the alcohol very well, and goes down very smoothly. Not as crisp as I normally like from a DIPA, but oddly enough, it works in this case. Probably the most easy drinking DIPA I have ever had. I feel like I could drink several of these before realizing the potentially ruinous effect of all the alcohol."
"It doesn't get more drinkable than this DIPA. The alcohol isn't even noticeable and the hops add some great flavor. This gets a great score because of its drinkability. It's a DIPA but it drinks like a regular Pale Ale. The mix of hop varieties along with the honey seem to match well. Recommended."
"I'd suggest trying to find it somewhere and give it a try, I'm more of a stout person myself, but you can never go wrong with any of the Bell's selection."
"First one of the year as I snagged almost the last case the store had. Upon poping the bottle wow I mean holy hops. Citrusy delicious hops. On the poor nice head good lacing and a beautiful slightly hazy amber gold. Taste fully of hops what did one expect good malt presence can taste the honey in the middle. Great easy drinking beer somewhat different from what I remember last years as but stellar none the less."
"Good lord. I can't think of a more exceptional display of hops as the centerpiece of American craft brewing."
"This was my first experience with Hopslam and I now understand the hype behind it....wow"
"Now, one other thing. The price. It is expensive, yes. It is good, yes. But, I have never tasted anythiing quite like it. So, if you want the experience, fork over the money."
"Easy to drink despite the big hops, no real sign of the 10% abv, too easy to have."
"Drinkability - incredibly smooth. Just a brilliant beer. I am so glad I got to get some on tap. I actually had some Dreadnaught along side the HopSlam, and the HopSlam blew it away (not that the Dreadnaught was not not excellent)."
"Over all, this is some great stuff. Don't cellar this, be sure to drink it fresh. I'm not even through 1 of the 4 six-packs and I'm going to see if I can find some more before it sells out for another HopSlam season."
"D- too bad this beer is 10%, because it's taste and smoothness makes this one id love to be able to drink all night. That's really the only thing bad I have to say about this. It's a wonderful DIPA that ill be sad to see go. Make this a year round beer please bells!"
"This is an amazing beer. A truly distinctive and memorable beer. My first sniff of this one will be forever etched in my mind. I don't think I have ever smelled such a wonderfully fruity, floral, tropical nose in a beer before. The character of the hop aroma in this is simply amazing. This beer truly has a """bouquet.""" The mouthfeel is big, full, and totally satiating. The expressions of the hops are just fascinating. So complex, so intriguing. If you are a hop head, you need to try this beer. One of the finest DIPAs you will find anywhere."
"D - Not for the newbie, but so enjoyable...I think I'll have another right now. That makes it pretty drinkable...no?"
"Like many before me have noted, what a drinkable beer for a 10% ABV. Again, I'm torn because I want to drink alot of it because it tastes so good but I dodn't want to have a raging headache at work tomorrow."
"Pours a golden copper with medium/heavy carbonation and an off white fluffy head. Smells of citrusy goodness. Lots of fruity hops. It also has a very unique nose-stinging chemical like hop aroma that hits me as pull the beer away from my nose. Maybe it's the dankness of the hops coming through. Whatever this smell is, the other DIPAs I've tried don't have it. The taste is like putting marijuana and citrus fruits together in a blender and serving it as a drink. The dankness of the beer is very pronounced. It definitely has a good deal of malts too and balances well. After my first sip my saliva became much more viscous due to the balancing malts. Mild/medium bittering aftertaste. Mouth feel is medium light with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkablity is remarkable for a 10% ABV beer. This would absolutely be in my IPA rotation if I could get this year-round."
"Super whipped-up, agitated head of white froth, very sticky lacing. Brightly hued orange to yellow throughout, not fully transparent but clean and quite pretty. The nose is a citrus fest of pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime, if you can adjust to this you might be able to tease out pine resin, rose hips, nectarine, papaya and pineapple fruit scents, not much discernible malt-wise but doesn't feel out of balance, very credible lift in the nostrils. Medium-bodied, isn't bitter at all, more stings or pinches the palate than bites it. Same gargantuan element of pink grapefruit, tangelo, lime citrus, equally sweet and sour. The floral dimension a touch stronger, aided by the honey accents. On the other hand, any pine or charcoal flavors step back. Texturally, it's crisp and lively and built for speed, glides down the chute. No grassy nor herbaceous pucker, the hops taste fresh like you could wring them out with your hands. Carbonation shows a gentle but persistent hand. Real fun to throw back."
"I love the hops and when I tied this beer my taste buds said HOLY CRAP!! The aroma when I opened it was a lot like grapefruit and hops. Then I poured it to see an orange haze which I expected more golden. I also expected to see the nice head but it teneded to recede quicker then expected. A nice semi-crisp medium bodied with a bit of oiliness resin. I expected a major bitterness but was surprised on how smooth it was for having so much hops. Don't get me wrong this is a very hoppy beer that made me pucker up like most IPAs and DIPAs. However it is still pretty smooth especially for having a 10% abv. Very well balanced and surprising smoother then expected. This is definitely one hellava great IPA. Thank you Bells!!"
"D: I had three and thus I am writing the review the day after (I took notes). I think the drinkability, balance, and ease of this beer is what makes it an exceptional example of the style."
"D:Drinkability- Disguises the alcohol content masterfully, with a very smooth mouthfeel."
"D - Extremely... even as i try to pace myself, im starting to see the bottom of the glass in less than a half hour. 10% would dictate, to me, a sipper, however, this beer keeps telling me, 'go on, have another.' Great brew, well worth the hype, If I saw this on tap I would definitely order a few pints."
"thanks to biniek 13 for including this as an extra. I recieved it today, and then checked the batch number to discover it's less than two weeks old. Insane. We don't get beers distributed here that quickly."
"Makes my tummy warm."
"D - Drinkability is good, I could drink a few of these without a hesitation, but I am having trouble finishing this review after just one!"
"D/O - This beer seems to be at it's most drinkable slightly below room temperature. It's a DIPA, if you're tossing down a sixer in one sitting something's gone terribly wrong. Hop heads are understandably thrilled with the beer, and craft lovers should at least be able to respect it. It's well enough off the beaten path, and in a good way, that it's worth searching out."
"Overall Impressions: Well-balanced for the style and extremely deceptive in the alcohol department. I prefer a bit more complexity, but if you love big grapefruit flavors in your IPAs, you'll love this beer."
"Going to MI soon, maybe I'll find it on tap."
"drinkability: i could drink this all day, throughout the year. i want this for the summertime but i doubt if i'll find another six and if i do that i could keep it that long."
"O: A True """Hop Bomb"""! If this is what you like...As Emril says """BAM!""" It is good stuff"
"This beer pours an amber orange color with a small head that dissipates quickly. The smell is in your face HOPS! Also, pine and citrus with a huge grapefruit nose. The taste has huge citrus flavors - pinapple, orange and grapefruit with a touch of honey and alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and coats the mouth with hop oil and has perfect carbonation. Drinkability is hindered only by the high alcohol content. Overall, My absolute favorite IPA. I could drink this all day if the alcohol and price were not so high."
"Nikki"
"D - Hopslam on draft. I've been waiting for the better part of two weeks to finally try this on draft, and it did not disappoint! Simply one of the best DIPAs out there. The alcohol presence knocks the drinkability down just a tad, but otherwise it drinks pretty good for 10%, don't it?!"
"Overall- This is an great beer, there are not many subtleties to it but that's ok, lots of flavor great body and awesome hop character. This is one of my favorite DIPAs."
"At this age, I find this to be a super drinkable beer. Very well balanced and all around tasty."
"One of the top tier double IPA's in my eyes."
"An impressive brew. I think I like it more than the Dreadnaught IPA from Three Floyds, but there is likely to be a side-by-side (maybe with Buckeye '76) in the future. Plenty of interesting hop character, but I think the slight over-reliance on sweetness detracts from the beer - makes it a bit too accessible at the expense of excellence. Nonetheless, it is a great beer."
"D - Alcohol aside, this beer is a bit lighter drinking than some double IPAs. Overall though the flavor is completely original and the aromas are great."
"Would I get it again? I'm not sure, in my humble opinion this is probably one of the best hoppy beers that I've ever had. With that said... 16.99 a 6-pack? Hrm... I'll stick with good ole' 2 hearted for now."
"M/D - The body is light enough to drink more than one.. as long as you don't have anywhere to do... This is what it is, a big celebration of hops. I'm kinda curious what the malt in this beer tastes like, wonder if any will make it long enough to tell me... If you are looking for balance, go somewhere else. Impressive how many different flavors the hops do pull off here, so cheers to that!"
"Drinkability: This beer absolutely surpasses the hype. It is an absolutely phenomenal beer, and has become my favorite IPA. I don't know if this is supposed to be part of the review or not, but the *only* thing knocking down the drinkability is the price. 18 dollars for a six-pack is a bit prohibitive, despite how good the beer is. Other then that, there is very little I can criticize from this beer."
"The beer is presented in a 10oz globe style glass. This beer pours a dangerously hazy honey-orange with a huge 3 inch head that left, surprisingly, very little lacing. The aroma is a nice blend of west coast citrus with east coast pine. Unfortunately, there really isn't any distinct fruits available in the nose, like with so many Diva's. The flavor is amazing. This beers flavor sums up what I'm always looking for on the first sip of a DIPA. Huge blasts of mango and peaches with some grapefruit trying to wiggle its way forward in the flavor profile. Absolutely magnificent. Also the malt backbone really adds a subtle sweetness the background of the hops. The mouthfeel is everything I want in a DIPA. Full and resiny, leaving a distinctly piney residue on the palate. All I can say is, Larry Bell, take a bow."
"This was my first bottle of HopSlam and I found it quite enjoyable. I'm not the prototypical Hop Head, but enjoyed it none the less. Highly recommend."
"love this beer, it's definitely one of my favorite DIPAs and favorite beers overall"
"Hazy amber colored with a thick head that persists (even from a growler). smell is all hops - grapefruit and citrus. a little nose of biscuit in the back too. taste is a bit sweet up front, then the hops come in and balance and then back to a sweetness in the finish. notes of citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit fill this beer. alcohol is well hidden for 10%. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy yet has plenty of carbonation."
"D- The only problem I see with the drinkability of Hopslam is that you want to keep drinking it until the 10% smacks you in the face. My new favorite DIPA!"
"I could drink these all day. Or, I could drink them all day if the 10% abv didn't put me to sleep after a sixer."
"Bottom Line: This is one special brew. I think it is my new favorite DIPA. I was scared it wouldn't live up to the hype but i can certaintly say that it does and possibly surpasses it. If you can get your hands on this beer definitely pick up a case while supplies last. It's worth every penny even at 60 dollars a case. You won't be disappointed."
"Note - I absolutely love the label..."
"D: Dunno really how to come at this one. I know it's a very popular brew and it is in fact tasty but I wouldn't want it often simply because it doesn't seem like something i could drink more than 2 of without Tums or whatever kind of exoskeleton allowed the alien to have acid blood. What can I say. Tasty, fruity, and intense but very unbalanced."
"A peachy grapefruit flower punch to your traditional understanding of an IIPA. Definitely more of a citrus taste than last year. One of the best beers I have every had. For $16 a six pack, it better be. I wish there was a way to store and cellar this beer so that it could last until next year's release."
"Cheers Bell's for another amazing brew."
"I've heard Dreadnaught comparisons and they are valid. I think I prefer this one; it retains more of the astringency and bitterness of the style. This is my new 2nd favorite IPA (Pliny stays on top)."
"Overall, up there with Short's Anniversary and Pliny in the DIPA style for me. I highly recommend anyone who can get their hands on this beer drink the hell out of it while it is fresh as this is just a masterpiece of a DIPA."
"This is a great beer, I don't know if its worth the extra $8-10 I would pay per six compared to GLBC Commodore Perry IPA, but certainly is one every hop head needs to try."
"A world-class brew worth the hype, the price, the case limits, everything. Find it, buy it, love it. Bell's HopSlam and Troeg's Nugget Nectar make January and February the most enjoyable winter months. And they're even better on tap!"
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with great carbonation and feel. Though alcohol is a significant presence in the flavor and the belly-warming nature of the drink, HopSlam is a highly quaffable credit to the talented folks at Bell's."
"Medium in body heavy in ABV, Hopslam is a very drinkable beer, almost TOO drinkable. I was surprised that I couldn't detect any alcohol on the nose or tongue considering the 10% ABV. Absolutely look forward to this beer every year...and honestly, it's gotta be one of my favorite beers, period!"
"love it."
"I'm not sure if this lives up to the hype or not but it is a great beer at the very least. In a lot of ways it probably wasn't what I was expecting but I've tried to review as if I'd simply seen this on a shelf during a stroll through the beer store one day. While this is nothing short of a great beer as I said earlier, it's perhaps not necessarily ground breaking in the world of DIPAs. HopSlam's most notable feature is it's interesting balance, which keeps things incredibly interesting and incredibly drinkable."
"Drink: The smoothness of this is countered only by the 10% abv. Which is preasent only slightly. But, you do feel it. This could be a sneaky one!"
" Drinkability... WTF the bottle says 10%? If this is true I would say hands down I have never had a beer that concealed the alcohol so completely. If this was available to me regularly I think I could put away a lot in a session. Probably good that I cant get it, because at 10% i would probably pay the price."
"Smells like I'm in the middle of a hop field. Lots of grapefruity, citrusy, smells with some piney aromas as well. I am also getting a touch of sweetness as well. Maybe from the honey. Taste freakin awesome it's a shame the beer strore had a two six pack limit. This thing is loaded with hops but there not overpowering very citrusy with some grapefruit flavors as well. There is a slight bitter finish but doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste. I should be careful with this stuff it is way too drinkable. I can hardly detect any alcohol. My new love affair with DIPA's is growing with every sip."
"D= dangerously high. This beer is a lot sweeter than I expected in the finish. Tastes great though. I'll be getting more."
"Pours a nice orange color, decent head but not frothy. Nose is pink grapefruit.I was expecting a sweetish type Double; No way. Citrus taste is the 1st on tongue, nice bitterness, but not overly aggressive. Very nicely balanced, not overly anything but great. Not boozy and the 10% is completely hidden.I was slurping the bottom of the glass when I was done. Drink ability is down a fraction due to the high ABV, I could easily drink a six, but I'd be staggeringly shit faced. Easily worth the price tag and the hassle of running ragged to get some."
"Great Beer."
"On a side note: Hop slam is great but the prices are getting crazy. A take out sixer was $26, other local places are around $20. Cases range from $60-74 bucks depending where you go. Hopslam is a great beer and I will buy a case this year, but if it goes much higher next year count me out. I would rather get 2 cases of something else."
"Pours a light golden amber with a head that fades to film, moderate lacing. Strong pine, hoppy aroma. Wow, no wonder they call it hopslam. This thing is hoppy hoppy hoppy. Other flavors are subtle and nice, but the hops definitely dominate this one. The ABV is hidden pretty well. I definitely can say I enjoy this. Would have another and would recommended it to someone interested in hops."
"Future outlook: Not sure about the hype of this one, but decided to dive in along with a fellow BA'er with similar hype-phobic misgivings...just as he was, I was blown away by this one. Dynamite. I'll surely cave to the sticker shock again next time around on this gem."
"(All in all, I was extremely disappointed. It is the first Bell's offering that I've sampled that has let me down. I will give it another try and hope that maybe I was just having an off day. In the mean time I am getting another case of Nugget.) Maybe my pallate has changed over the last year or I am becoming more of a hophead but I went back and edited my scores. The Hopslam I had in 2010 taste much better than the 2009 that I had last year."
"Overall this year is a terrific batch of Hopslam. So drinkable and so enjoyable it's crazy. Awesome."
"The best DIPA I can buy at a local store - much preferable to Dreadnaught."
"At 10%abv you don't need many, but at $15+/six pack that's probably a good thing."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle"
"D-..Speechless.. Oh ya it's 10%!"
"Drinkability - one to seek out year after year, mmm..."
"EDIT: The 09/10 seemed to have a lot more honey than the batch that I reviewed. I liked it."
"Highly recommend..."
"Drinkability - two is max for me. I wish I could have more in a session but it would put me on my ass. Maybe that's good - it allows me to savor this elixir for a longer timeframe."
"Taste is what I've been waiting for. This beer is so well balanced contrary to the smell. One might expect it to have a super bitter taste given the way it smells (plus the name), but this beer is all about major amounts of hops but enough malt and hops to make things very well balanced. I can't really think up the right words to describe it, but this is one of the best beers I've ever had. The top of Bells' lineup in my opinion."
"Yes this is a pretty pricey beer and it is a limited release, but you know what, who cares? Every winter, this magical brew comes into our lives out here in the midwest and helps remind us that spring will come."
"Its sad that its only release as a seasonal, its overpriced, and can be hard to get ahold of."
"A gem."
"love this beer. too bad it's hard to find and available for such a short time. pours clear, little head, little lacing. smells of grapefruit very citrusy. exceptionally hopped nice bitterness. i shouldn't have more than one since i'm working tommorrow, but i will. this one is just too good."
"This beer definitely lives up to the hype. It makes Stone Ruination seem like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Poured to a one fingered head that didnt last long. Did have some big bubbles around the edges and left some lacing. Ale was yellowish brown in color. Head had a slight orange tint. Smelled like grapefruit, pine, and malt. No alcohol was detected. Had a strong grapefruit flavor. Along with that piney hops. Also hints of malt. Had a slight bitter aftertaste. Actually not as strong as I thought it would be. Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was right. Another ale that you would have to be carefull while enjoying. The taste is so good and smooth, all you want to do is gulp it down. With the higher alcohol content you would have to be carefull. I had a good buzz after two."
"Clear orange poor with a small offwhite head and a little lacing. Aromas of grapefruit zest, oranges, peaches, pepper, pine, creamy caramel and hoppy. Sweet start but the bitter peppery bitterness hits you big time right at the end. Slightly sweeter than most IIPAs. Alcohol is present but far from overwhelming. Smooth, creamy and velvetty mouthfeel. Taste is very citrusy and very hoppy as well. Tastes amazingly fresh.As it warms the flavor changes to a very nice sugary grapefruit. Very Good."
"D: Heck yes. Drink it and drink it often."
"*Note: It's hard to recall but I feel like this tasted a little more earthy/grassy than last years. Maybe this is fresher than I had ever tried it last year, either way not a bad thing. I'd be curious to find out what kind of hops they use, if I had to guess a couple I'd say centennial is in there and maybe amarillo or cascade."
"Overall: Just as awesome as I remembered it last year. Unbelievable brew. Sucks that it's only out one month a year but I guess it makes the taste even more desired. If you haven't tried it. GET IT NOW! Get it fresh. This definitely holds up to its status as one of the top beers in the world. So lucky to come from Michigan."
"D: Easy to drink more than one, but be careful. No way to tell it's 10% in either the aroma or taste."
"Had to share my only bottle with my neighbor. Pours an amber golden color with a thick white head that laces the glass perfectly. Smells of brilliant grapefriut citrus hops with a touch of apricot and malt. Freshly cut citrus comes to mind. Absolutly the best smelling beer on earth. Tastes of citrusy grapefruit with a perfect touch of honey. Brilliantly balanced. Mouthfeel is great but drinkability is low due to being so high in alcohal."
"enjoy but be careful, its a 10 percent abv beer"
"Thanks for sharing, Larry Bell."
"I first had Hopslam on tap at Dilly Deli in Marimont, OH last year, but I was excited to sit down and actually analyze it deeper this time around. I found this beer to be surprisingly easy to drink, but a total pallet killer all the same. It has taken me a while to do this review as new things come to me each time I take a drink. This is a very complex beer for a """hop bomb"""."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Unlike any other IIPA/DIPA I have ever had. A truly unique experience."
"Not much to say about this that hasn't already been said. Click on the highest reviews and picture me nodding in agreement. It might be through the power of suggestion, but I love the honey sweetness in this one. Some DIPAs have a """rough""" sweetness. The honey, though, seems to smooth things out instead. I love this one. Just a fresh citric blast, hell yeah!"
"D - too many hops for me. I may have jumped to the DIPAs a little too quickly."
"D= My first ever bottles last night. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I wish the price point was better."
"D= Wow, this is every bit as fantastic as I remembered it. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this was delicious and I will drink as much as I can possibly attain while it is fresh. Very drinkable and damned dangerous as it hides its alcohol well. You need to get some!"
"I believe the hype. This is truly a unique DIPA. Not the most bitter hop bomb but a truly well crafted ale."
"Pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is hops, hops and more fresh hops with some malt and a touch of alcohol in the background. There is a lot of grapefruit and other citrus in the aroma from the hops. The taste like the aroma suggests is dominated by the fresh citrusy hop flavors. There is also a solid malt backbone, but it is overshadowed by the delicious hop profile. The drinkability is extremely high for a brew of this caliber, however it is probably not a good idea to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that is probably my favorite beer IPA/DIPA category. Highly Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lively."
"overall, a fantastic ale. the honey is not even worth mentioning, since the hops are so perfectly powerful."
"Well done."
"D: I know the ABV will catch up to me eventually but I'm drinking the shit out of this until it does! About as close to Pliny as us Eastern guys will get. A pure masterpiece!"
"Medium sized yellowish head, lightly carbonated. Just slightly hazy bright amber color. Very fragrant, hoppy, sweet, pineapple, green grapes, earthy. Starts very juicy, a lot of pineapple, peaches, fairly sweet. Medium body. Up until the end, reminiscent of a fruity white wine. Then the finish comes on strongly and deliciously bitter and lingering. Alcohol is notiecable but hidden. Overall a very good beer, would get this again."
"Overall; this is the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had on draft without a shadow of a doubt. The 10% ABV is well-hidden. Hopslam is pefectly balanced and well worthy of its hype and praise...Fantastic in every aspect. Again, certainly in my mind and taste buds the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had on draft."
"its a good beer. but im not really feeling it right now. so this is a shitty review so sue me. i want a fresh one."
"Overall: I don't think I'm doing this beer justice, since I'm having a one-year old bottle...but I do think this beer may be a little over hyped. Worth a try if you are given the chance. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"M: Slightly thin, but good and well carbonated. Keeps the drinkability up. Must remember it's 10% abv."
"Notes: this is a big IPA. this is what an IPA should taste like. the fact that it is brewed with honey is brilliant. the honey is never really present in a forward sense, but is happy working its magic in the background with its sweet offering in the aroma and the rich body it has and the stick-to-your-mouth persistence."
"Well.. I'm very lucky to live in Michigan and to have unlimited sources of this amazing brew over the next few months. It's going to be my beer of choice until it's sold out everywhere!"
"This is a standout beer."
"Can't wait to have some more of these, its good now, which mean it'll be even better fresh and up for review again."
"The hops in this one slam into you like a novacaine hurricane and don't let up until you tap into submission. Beautiful gold pour with a massive citrus and floral aroma that largely features oranges. Some honey in the flavor on top of the aforementioned ingredients. For serious hop lovers only."
"D - I could drink all night but the next day would hurt. Great beer tho."
"I'm thinking this would have been outstanding had it been fresh and on tap. The addition of honey almost gives off a sweet hop flavor. Hop ice cream. Yum."
"D_Another delcicious Bell's offering that falls flat in the looks department."
"Similar, with less complexity, more bitterness, less fruit and honey. Graded down accordinly."
"Hop Slam is only available in January and I believe most of the distribution is in or around the midwest so stock up. The brewery is in the Kalamazoo Michigan area."
"What a cool looking label! Poured a medium amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Had strong fresh green leafy hoppiness aroma with orange peels. Sticky. Tastes of oranges, caramel, floral, with a grapefruit finish. Smooth and way too easy to drink. Alcohol content well hidden."
"A much larger hop presence, smells of pineapple and citrus drenched in honey. A much more pleasant experience fresh."
"[Batch 7806] Poured a lightly hazy, copper color with a medium sized, white head that left spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of pine, floral hops, melon, tangerine, caramel, light citrus, and honeydew. Taste of pine, toffee, resin, light dough, citrus fruits, mint leaf, and some cinnamon. Bracingly bitter, with moderate alcohol."
"i was lucky enough to drink 7 of these in the past 3/4 months. took notes through out, and the conclusion is that this beer is absolutely killer. Beautiful orange brown color, small white head. Amazing pine notes in the nose, sweetened grapefruit and orange peel, lots of earthy grassy hops battle with the fresh, semi sweet citrusy hops, all of this is overseen by a very rugged malty backbone adding incredible balance. Coating but smooth, the 10% ABV is completely masked by the beers more than impressive flavor profile. Some say this beer is best fresh but i was equally impressed with every single bottle i cracked open, my most recent being 11/2/08. Cant wait to get some more this year. Safe to say i highly recommend this one."
"Not the freshest bottle, so take this review with a grain of salt. It pours a woody brown color with a thick beige head and excellent lacing. The nose has a big bouquet of fruity hops over a rich malt profile. Taste has an explosion of citrusy and piney hops well balanced by sweet bready malts. Big oily body is carbonated perfectly . A great brew, but I would love to try a fresh bottle."
"I first had this a while ago, but didn't appreciate it nearly as much as I do now upon retasting. Appearance is a hazy amber color with substantial white head. Smell and taste is hoppy, but very well balanced by malts and honey. What a welcome break from west coast IPAs. This reminds me of Dogfish 90. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky, and well carbonated. Highly guzzleable, I'd put this up there with Dogfish 90 and Burton Baton as one of my favorite IPAs. Not surprising, coming from my favorite brewer."
"I suspected this bottle might have a bit of age to it. Checking the Bell's website I see a feature allowing one to enter the batch number. How cool! This was brewed in January 08, so it's got a little under a year on it. Not as old as I thought it might be. This is certainly a good DIPA, but there are better ones out there. Try it if you get a chance."
"This beer did not brooze my touge from the bitterness, like the label suggests. Iam used to west coast iipas so my touge may be different than some. If I could get this in my state I would buy it on occasion, but I wouldnt trade for it again. Awsome label. Glad to have tried. Good beer!"
"10/24/08 tasting, 9 months in: The aroma is much more mellow on the hops and now I can definitely pick up the honey that was covered up by the intense hops before. The taste is much weaker, the hops only coming through at about 30% of what they were before. Still tasty, but it doesn't even taste like the same beer. In the words of Russian River, """Drink fresh, do not age!""""
"Overall: a worthy brew"
"a hazy reddish golden color with one finger of head that leaves quickly. smells smooth, hoppy, boozy, and sweet. it has a medium body that is somewhat smooth. there is a honey-like sweetness to it that rounds out the bitter hops nicely. this one finishes with a mouth filling bite towards the end of the sip."
"Thanks to my man hrking for this one."
"nice and bitter at the start but as it warms the honey comes out to be eaqual to the hops. this is the first time that i have ipa with honney, i like this one but its not my first choise. this is a beer that i would drink agan, i do love the huge floral flavor on this one. this is a beer that should be tryed by everyone"
"pours up a murky copper color with a nice white head. the smell is all sorts of hop characters! citrus, floral, grapefruit, subtle spices. Its a hop medley! the taste is remarkably smoothe for a shitload of IBUs! i taste all of your hop characteristics here. mostly citrus though. the 10% ABV is very unapparent. full bodied, medium carbo. Deelish!"
"Wow, really lacking as a double IPA. It's kind of a mess. Horrendously overrated. A fantastic brewery (the best brewer of stouts in America in my estimation) but this is a beer that is surprisingly lacking in craftmanship and taste. Miss it."
"A great awesome hoppy brew. Pours an orangeish amber, with a thick white head. Aroma of honey and very strong hops. The flavor is a delicious blend of citrusy hops with a honey sweetness unlike the typical maltiness of many imperial IPAs. The alcohol is also prominent, but not in a bad way. This is a favorite beer when in mood for hops."
"Very unique, very strong and very tasty! This one gets better as it warms too."
"Drinkability is ridiculous. A beer this big should not go down this easy. Alcohol is masked completely in the flavor. Does not get overly sweet or bitter, exceptional balance. One could easily drink more or at least faster than intended. Call me a homer but this is one of the best DIPA's made."
"Great drinkability with a flavor that begs you to drink more. Just delicious and at 10% you better watch out before this really slams you. After finishing a bottle I really wanted another."
"Drinkability - Pleasantly bitter. This is one of my favorite styles, so perhaps I'm biased. I could drink this for weeks, and no, I'm not at all disparaged by the alcohol content. For a spring or Summer brew you can't go wrong with this, very 4th of July."
"This one comes out a translucent honey with a healthy white head. It certainly doesn't look 10%. The aroma isn't extremely fragrant, but it's quite nice. Sweet citrus, pine needles, honey, and a little bit of hay. The flavor is almost perplexing, with a powerful bitterness on the front of the tongue that disappears from the finish, with some oak, orange pith, and slightly medicinal alcohol dryness. Malt presence is negligible, but not insufficient to back the hops, and the body is thin enough to keep the beer as refreshing as a regular IPA."
"Another quality offering from Bells."
"I've had this a few times before without yet reviewing it, but I finally popped open my last one from past January '08 (Batch 8283). This is the holy grail of beer! Poured a dark amber-golden with medium clarity and medium to heavy carbonation with a slight white head. The hops are apparent at quite a distance, and once you actually put your nose in it, you've reached the motherland. On the tip of the tongue, the bitter hops are already being absorbed, and upon swallowing, the piney flavor melds with the monster hops to the most pleasurable blend imaginable. It's medium to heavy bodied and a true hop-SLAM, yet goes down smooth and remains extremely drinkable. This seasonal is one to definitely one to stock up on to enjoy sparingly at special moments throughout the year! Thank you, Bell's!"
"Reviewing beers like this one is fun. This is one fine beer. Pours a clear light orange color with a medium sized head. A wonderful grapefruit hoppy aroma. The flavor is grapefruit hops with a good amount of honey and maybe some caramel. Bitter, dry with a pretty clean finish considering the style. Extremely well balanced. This has got to be the smoothest beer with this much alcohol I have ever had. I have got to get more of this stuff!"
"Seems like the hops may be lower than what I expected, but I think this may be the result of a superbly balanced DIPA, one of the best I ever had."
"So far, the best beer I've tried from Bell's."
"M,D: The lively carbonation is fantastic and the drinkability is high, but after one you are most likely done with this ABV!"
"D - Terrific brew that I could drink all night every night, if I had too :)"
"I would never have guessed that this one clocked in at 10% and for that this one gets major drinkability points, as I could drink this like any standard IPA."
"Very fresh and very citrusy - I get the grapefruit more than I remember in the past. It's big in the nose and even more epic in the flavor. Such a massive hop hit but yet enough sweetness to not feel overpowered. What a great double IPA!"
"The name says it all. Extremely hoppy. Surprisingly drinkable considering the bitterness and the level of alcohol. Some lacing on the glass. Big hop aroma and flavor. Some sweetness balances things out. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who is into hops."
"had at the first ever in history Stumelagram Tasting !! .. what a treat, time to ring that Bell .... funny, it IS very biting ... has a nice abv ... lots of floral/citrus aromas .. tastes fresh, like an apple of hops.... mellow and tasty as it warms a bit ... lots of tasty hops flavours.. good stuff"
"Seek this out. Now. Do it."
"D = A destination beer meaning that it's best enjoyed in your favorite easy chair. One leaves you good (and wanting more), two beers and most people should be satisfied. Remember the high ABV because this one can slip by you quickly. If you finish the 6-pack, it will result in a great night - bad morning."
"this is a very drinkable beer, but at 10% it would be hard to kill a bunch of them."
"Drinkability is very good, limited by the obvious power of the brew."
" A beautiful brew with massive complexity and a massive malt backbone to support the sweet, fruity hops."
"Bottle at Coles. Hazy orange with a big grapefruit and pine aroma with some sweet pineapple. Not as hoppy as I expected. As it warms up it starts to get a bit hot and boozy towards the end. Meh, a decent example but there are much better DIPAs out there."
"Pours a beautiful honey/orange color, it's nearly glowing in the glass, off-white head fades pretty fast, but leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Very sweet nose on this, lots of caramel aroma, plenty of citrus hop notes as well. This is just a fantastically balanced Imperial IPA...with a name like HopSlam, I was thinking """wildly unbalanced", which I'm generally fine with, love the hop bombs. But the balance between the sweet malts and the bitter/citric/floral hops is pretty much perfect. Slight chewiness on the tongue, subdued but lasting bitterness. I like that this is in a 12oz. bottle, keeps things from getting out of hand (with the high ABV). An excellent Imperial IPA!"
"This is now one of my favorite beers. The drinkability is insane. All of the good things about a super-hoppy beer, but with the ability to drink it all night long. That's a good beer, my friends."
"Sampled this at the Eccentric back in May after partaking of several other offerings from Bell's; however, I'm thankful for the opportunity to try this as a standalone. Received this as a generous extra from bgramer (thanks Brendan). Batch 8277 printed on the bottle. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a one-inch loose head. Cap reduced to half its size within seconds before settling into a thin skim of foam and ringlets. Some strands of watery lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Scent off the cap pop was sweet; however, aromas in the glass yielded a predominantly floral hops nose, with a mead-like quality detectable in the background. Taste consistent with nose, with a very complex flavor profile; both sweet and bitter at the same time. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a slightly viscous feeling and a light effervescence in the mouth. I'm generally not one for IPAs, but Hopslam is in a category all its own in my opinion."
"D-Anywhere anytime if i see it consoder it purchased."
"M&D: Medium body, and the smoothest beer I ever had the pleasure of sipping. At 10% ABV this drinks just as well as any single IPA out there. With a little age, the hops are a somewhat more subdued than when fresh, but I think this is even better than a new bottle. I am a hophead, and this is exactlly what I want to be drinking. Supurb! Skal."
"D: now that we might be """in""" with the staff I hope we can come upon more of this more often. I would always have a couple of bottles if possible."
"Tasty. Who's still hoarding some? :)"
"Overall it's a very smooth double IPA loaded with fruity (mostly pineapple) hop flavor. A great balancing act considering its strength, this one is suprisingly easy to drink. A bump in carbonation and more complexity in hop flavors would kick this into overdrive."
"My wife brought me a 6 pack of this beer. I was definately looking forward to trying this beer. It pours amber with a slight white head. The smell of this beer is astounding... definately the best smelling beer I have smelled to date. You can smell citrus, hops and malt in a beautiful harmony. The flavor is wonderful for a dipa, borderline grapefruit juice :) the 9.3% alcohol is well hidden but it seems a little overcarbonated imo. Not something I could drink all night but certainly a great beer."
"Very good. I'm a huge hops fan, and this one doesn't dissapoint at all. Could probably only have a few of these because of the high alcohol content. My only regret is that I didn't get a case, now I'm going to have to wait until next year."
"I can definitely understand why this beer is so popular. It is hoppy and has substantial bitterness, but a great malty backbone and residual sweetness to support the hops. This is one of my favorites DIPAs."
"Thank you Bell's for sticking to reasonably priced 6 packs!"
"D- This is a great example of a go for broke intensely hopped beer which still manages to be balanced. Due to the high ABV and sheer amount of hops I think I could only do about two of these before moving on but none the less another fantastic brew from Bell's"
"Get it."
"D - give me another is all I can think of when I finish one of these, delicious.."
"Pours a nice frothy, off-white, head that fully disappears. Aroms is heavy hops with big grapefruit and orange . There's also a hint of vanilla and , of course honey. Doesn't have the bit that manny douple IPAs seem to have. Even thought the alocohol is high, there is very little that I could taste, but I could feel it."
"This one is a brillaint hazey thick yellow with orange outlines. It has a thick sticky electric white head left great lacing. It reaks of overripe fruite in the very best possible way, pineapple is strong as well as sweet carmalled malts. I get a great burst of pineapple flavor with some mango and wonderful bitter hits throughout that match well with the earthy/sweet malts. Nice mouth feel and very drinkable for being so hopped up. I have been drinking alot of really good hoppy beers of late and this one really seperated itself from the others."
"I would give this a perfect score but its drinkability is limited by its high abv and me having to travel out of illinois to get it."
"I've been drinking Hopslam since January and I will say that the bite goes down a bit with age. However, that bite is so intense in Jan. and Feb. that it is still great in the summer."
"Drinkability: Definite session ale. I had this on tap a few months back and it is just as good in the bottle. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"D- Easy to drink, a nice clean and crisp IIPA."
"Great drinkability and the ABV is well hidden. An incredible beer that I'm psyched to have gotten the chance to try. A new favorite DIPA!"
"D: Quite drinkable for its weight."
"If this beer were a muscle car it would be a Dodge Charger. There are a lot of other muscle cars out there, but this one is a cult classic."
"Huge thanks to Dave for this tasty treat!! Pours deep amber gold with a minimal white head. Huge hop aroma of pine, honey, and citrus. Honey and grapefruit dominate early, sliding aggressively into a hugely lasting bitter finish. Pretty full mouthfeel. One of the biggest beers I've ever head, up there with Double Bastard."
"Hopslam (dig the name) pours a beautiful bright golden apricot color with a tight, creamy, yellow tinted lid. The smell is tons of fruit and that's it. Gotta love it. Tangerines and oranges, pineapples and grapefruits all make a statement as they swirl together in the nose, and sweep through onto the palate. Fruits balance with the soft sweetness of animal crackers, and leave the flavor with a solid bitterness. Fantasticly full body with oily smoothness and creamy carbonation. Believe the hype. This is one awesome IIPA"
"Bottoms up..."
"Overall: THis is one kickass beer and I do love my hops. Bottled in the fall and drank almost in June so that character has diminished but this beer is still awesome just different. Does it deserve the really high rating? thats for you to decide but if you havent had it and have the chance too I would certainly recommend that you do."
"Seriously this is helping me rethink how I think of this style. I think of the 90 and 120 minutes and some American Barleywines when I drink of this stuff. It's that good folks. I recommend it HIGHLY!"
"12 oz bottle in to goblet. Not hazy, but not clear orangy with white head that leaves beautiful lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pine, and maybe orange. Sweet citrus taste that gets kicked by very strong hops. Perhaps my favorite beer. Pretty well masked 10% booze."
"I'm certainly open to revising this upward, but for top-of-its-class DIPA it had a couple small marks against it. This is, really, faint criticism. I loved the beer, look forward to trying more, and can't wait to do so. That said, there's a perfectness about its little brother, Two Hearted Ale, which this fails to duplicate, and perhaps I'm overharsh by the steep comparison."
"Drinkability - If I could get this regularly i would have it in my fridge stacked to the nines. An awesome beer that I would kill to get my hands on another. Thanks to Tosque for this great beer trade!"
"Drinkability - Loved the Oskar Blues Gordon. This baby just kicked it off its perch. One of the few beers that comes along and takes your breath away. Simply a marvelous creation."
"Overall, this is fantastic! It's very well balanced and is so yummy it's almost seems sessionable. I wish I could get this regularly! This is right at the top of my list."
"Damn shame this isn't available all year round. Special thanks to my new friends met at DLD for the two bottles thrown my way. Bell's never disappoints and this is no exception."
"Note: 2008 release (batch 8278 - 9 Jan 2008), which from what I can remember is definitely different from the 2007. 10% ABV for 2008."
"The aroma is a wallop of piney grapefruity hoppy deliciousness...immediately I smell Two Hearted Ale, one of my favorite brews. The flavor definitely delivers full-on hoppiness, no doubt. The flavors are excellent, bitter, floral, citrus, bitter finish, no complaints there. There is honey in this beer, and that sweetness is apparent, attempting to balance the ramped-up alcohol. The resulting mouthfeel is a bit slick and oily, which IMO detracts from the intense deliciousness of the hops. Again I am left not understanding the need for DIPAs. For me, Two Hearted delivers the same mouth puckeringly delicious hop flavors and aromas in a much more drinkable beer. No doubt as DIPAs go, this is a great one, and I am unlikely to turn one of these down if offered, but I'll take a near perfect IPA over a DIPA any day."
"Bell's Hopslam, I saved this beer for the end of the night so as to savor my taste buds for the hop slamming they are about to receive. Pours a somewhat hazy orange, with not too much heading, but a good enough white lacing. Smell is everything that you would want from a good Imperial IPA: resiny hops, citrus fruits, earthy hops...its got it all. I have to say that taste wasn't quite as good. The citrus notes came through well, with lots of pineapple, mango and orange along withe the hops, but I don't know, it felt as if something essential was missing....perhaps a bit more malt balance? Mouthfeel is viscous and sweet, yet bitter. One is more than enough for me in one night, but still, I am glad I had the chance to try this brew from Bell's. Maybe not the best DIPA I have had, but certainly ranks among the better ones I have tasted recently. Cheers"
"Pours a magnificent burnt copper with a thin but creamy white covering. Beautiful lacing. Rich nose of fresh, grassy, juicy citrusy hops on top of a subtly sweet and spicy malt backbone. Hops have faded just barely over the last couple months as the bitterness has died down a little and the sweet and spicy maltiness is playing a larger role in the finish. Medium to full bodied, and the carbonation is on point for what I look for in IIPAs. If you told me this beer was 10% I would have laughed at you. I am loving this beer a few months old just as much as I did fresh. This balance is perfect for me, and the drinkability is absurd."
"Drinkability: well balanced and very drinkable. No means is this a session beer, but you can easily enjoy more than one. Definite hophead beer."
"Not sure if I'd sampled an outdated bottle. Dot-matrix coded 8277 on the reverse label."
"D - Awesome brew that I could drink several of, but the 10% ABV makes it hard to have too many."
"Pours out a hazy golden color with red hints and a thin, dense white head. Nose is west coast floral hops, with dense syrupy honey. Taste is surprisingly malty, then the hops kick in and linger over dark honeycomb and bitter citrus. Slight alcohol on the end balances and mingles with the lingering hops. Mouthfeel is foamy and smooth. Good drinkability except for the ABV."
"This beer allows one to truly drink up some great hop flavor. I like the addition of the honey as well since it dries it out and isn't overly sticky sweet."
"D - I need to buy a case of this. Tomorrow."
"This beer has a great initial palate with tremendous fruitiness and gobbs of weight which is reflected in its dark yellow color. You taste the hops but do not experience any bitterness . What separates this beer from the others in this class is the finish. It is unique and very sweet almost like a very expensive dessert wine from France(Sauternes). What a luxury drink!!!! They are going to make more of this beer for the 2009 season."
"Luckly, I found 2 cases at a local beer store this weekend. (5/10). That should hold me over for a while."
"Three Floyd's take note. This is what Dreadnaught should aspire to be."
"Thanks to Demcorhip for the bottle!"
"Poured a clear amber color. Appears cloudy orange in the glass. Good retention. Exceptional lacing. Smelled predictably heavy of hops. Tastes bready, piney. Alcohol cleaverly hidden within. This brew is right in my wheelhouse, so I am slightly partisan to what it offers. That being said, I have been courted by a few brews that promised what this one does and they didn't deliver. This one does. I love it."
"D : It's 9.3% ABV? I can't believe that. I didn't taste it at all. Awesome beer and really drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful clear rich amber color with 1/2 inch of thick foamy eggshell colored head with nice retention and great lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pine, honey, biscuit, grass, grapes, and oranges. Tastes of grass mixed with sweet honey with a light biscuit backbone and a finish of grapefruit, orange peel, and a juniper tasting dryness, definitely a slam of hops. Medium in body with good carbonation and semi-syrupy but still smooth and sweet with a sticky dry bitter finish. Very easy to drink and extremely pleasant for a hop lover with an appropriate name. A little high in ABV to session, but it'd be well worth dealing with the aftermath the next day."
"mouthfeel felt oily and coated my mouth with lucious hops, bitter and crisp"
"D - Delicious - can't say much more."
"Bell's Hopslam Ale (12oz. bottle): Thanks to saucya or aksorak for this! Poured from bottle into pint glass. Golden color with a small head that recedes quickly. Aroma of sweet citrus hops, with a little resin and sweet malt underneath. A little tropical fruit too. Very nice smell. Taste hits you with bitter, resiny, hops at first, then a little citrus and bready malts. This beer has a medium body and is lively in the mouth. Drinkability is fairly high if you're into the style, which I increasingly am. Overall I'm pretty into this beer. Exactly what I was looking for today."
"I was really surprised by this beer. I expected just another over-hopped double IPA, but got something pretty dynamic instead. One of the best Bell's offerings I've tasted. I will definitely keep coming back to this one."
"Bottle. Batch 8277. Pours a sparkling murky cloudy pinkish amber. Lots of head, and a crazy amount of lacing. Aroma is spectacular; grapefruits and citrus out the ass. Hoppy as hell, incredibly vacuous and worthy of its own praise. Crazy good. Flavor is delectable: spicy hops and pleasant citrus interwoven with honey and ginger. Thick and syrupy, but with a nice watery and easy finish. Way too drinkable at 10%, but I feel overall it's not as striking of an IPA as Bells own Two Hearted Ale."
"Carefull with this one."
"Thanks again Charles - I am cracking open my Dreadnaught next!"
"Thanks to Tilley4 for the pleasure!"
"It was burnt orange in color and poured a 1/4""" white head of fine bubbles. Aromas of herb/floral hops followed by light citrus. These flavors continued into the mouth along with some honey. The palate was dense but didn't come off as heavy leading into a dry, bitter, hoppy finish. Well done and especially enjoyable for people who enjoy the herbal side of hops."
"No doubt, Hopslam delivers! I'd love to see how it holds up in a blind tasting as one with a sweeter malt profile might win out (for me at least)."
"D-WATCH OUT, YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THIS BEER. It goes down so easy you don't even realize the higher alcohol content."
"I have only one problem with this beer, and that is that it is not available here yet."
"The hops live up famously to the """slam""" appellation, but the balance is an impressive accomplishment, as it could easily slide too heavily toward the hops, yet it never does. The top-notch grain bill, both in blend and quality, is an awesome asset as well. The ABV is less an obstacle than a warming plus, and it drinks like a sweet hop-bomb should...that is, it eats just the right amount enamel from your teeth while reminding you of the malt in play. No surprise, everything they say about this one is true, and I'm thrilled, because I still have five more to savor."
"Drinkability. YES."
"D: Really good beer. Im I could get this on the regular I most definately would. Definately worth a try."
"D- The heavy bitterness in the taste detracts from the overall drinkability a bit."
"Drinkability: Very hoppy brew with nice balance. Not sure I could drink this all the time though."
"Poured orangey/caramel color with good white head that laced the glass for the whole 12 oz. Smelled of fruit hop grapefruit, orange citrus, and some sweet scents. Tasted great. With plenty of hop citrus and astringency and a balanced sweetness that was not bready or biscuity but very balanced. Where is the alcohol? Good feel in the mouth-slightly coating and a good level of carbonation. Very enjoyable beer. I don't tend to enjoy this style because it isn't balanced enough, but this one jas all of the right flavors. Thanks to Tilley4 for this treat. One of my favorite DIPAs out there"
"Holy Crap in a pita! A bold beast that is absolutely outstanding! The color was not what I was expecting. A little bit more orange and murky than what I'm used to, but not offsetting in any way. Smells like someone juiced a grapefruit on a pine tree. Taste is pretty dry with a bitter following. Overall, an oustanding beer that really hits the spot."
"D: I was extremely impressed with the beer. I would definitely put it in the top few DIPAs I've tasted. This would be a staple in fridge if I had easier access to it."
"i loved it. so should you."
"Finally I was able to get some of this and it was well worth the wait. Medium body with a thin head and a bit of retention. Moving on to the highlights... bam-- what an explosion of citrusy, grapefruit hops in the nose and then again in the taste with bitterness that is very present but not overwhelming. Very light and present in the mouth, making it very enjoyable and present. For the ingredients and the alcohol the drinkability is incredible as well. Here to looking forward to being able to find some more of this."
"Effect - this isn't a catagory, but I had only 1 bottle left for this review, wish I had another to sample, but I've already went through the rest of the 6pack over the past week. Anyway a guy could review beers for a salary? Ha ha ha.."
"It's a perfectly blended Double IPA. And checking in at 10% abv, who cares if you can't drink them all night?"
"Drinkability- If I were to guess on the ABV of this beer I would probably guess about 6-7% max, but this thing, being this drinkable at 10%, is dangerous. Not once did I pick up on big alcohol monster creeping in. Well done bells. All I can say is, I am glad I have 17 more bottles until next year."
"D- Easy to drink great look and taste. Only thing that is bad about this brew is the price at 15 for a six pack."
"A fantastic beer, and a must try for hopheads."
"D: A really good beer, I'm glad I finally got to try it. The honey really takes over the malt character and makes it light enough that the great hop flavour really shines through. Now I know why all the East coasters are psyched out of their minds about this beer."
"A good brew."
"Hopslam is extremely tasty, but it didn't quite live up to the hype or my expectations (considering how flavorful their IPA is). It seemed like a huge IPA but a small DIPA. This brew has been sitting in the bottle for a few months now and people on this site have been remarking that it's toning down a bit already. So, to be fair, I guess I really need to try this the week it hits the shelves."
"D: I am not a huge IPA fan but this beer is a great Imperial IPA. I could easily have two or three before returning to styles I prefer taking later into the night."
"M/D - Nice feel from the carbonation. One of the best tasting DIPA's I have had. Masks the 10% very well so watch out. Could definitley drink this one all night."
"My first Bell's offering and I am VERY pleased with it. Thanks go to Kegatron for the bottle."
"I've had early release bottles, post release bottles (the liquor store stockpiles it) and tap, all are exceptional."
"One of the best beers i have had with the amount of hops. Bell's did a good job! Many of my friends felt the abv was a little strong but i did not notice. I felt Bell's has a very unike flavor and complexity. For people who would like to try a highly hopped ale, this is a good one!"
"From a fairly hard pour I got about a 2 inch head which dropped a little but doesn't really seem to be going anywhere. It is a gorgeous copper gold color, rich and beautiful. The smell is floral hoppiness, clean and fresh with a slight sticky sweet character. The flavor is sharp citrusy hoppiness up front, a sweetness develops, then drops right into a lingering hop biting bitterness. This is far from a balanced beer, more like unadulterated hopjuice, but with a name like Hopslam that is obviously what they were going for. The mouthfeel is average, and drinkability is good for a 10% tastebud peeler. The honey added does a little to mellow it out. If you are a hophead this beer is great. I wouldn't call it complex, but it is what it is and I like that."
"Attractive amber color in the glass with a tiny bit of cream as the head. Earthy, pungent - but not overpowering scent. It reminded me of freshly moved glass. However, there was a distinct fruitiness to this brew. As I continued drinking it, I noticed it smelled exactly like a grapefruit. My husband remarked that it smelled like floral perfume. Super hoppy taste, which I expected, however it lacks that signature bite of many IPAs, making it quite drinkable. The finish is very clean and pleasantly bitter. I found this beer to be quite balanced and delicious."
"I think the hops have mellowed out a little as it's March/April, and it was brewed back in January."
"Drinkability: High! I'm not sure if this is a fresh sample, but you could've fooled me if not. I'd love to drink this off tap sometime, too. Wonderful beer. Seek it out."
"have i oversold this beer? maybe, but when i look back on this review, ill rem how i felt and when available go buy a case..."
"D: Amazingly smooth and easy to drink but the warming bitter finish slows the process. Sipping this is pure pleasure. I would say this is definitely one of the best beers of the year so far for me."
"Drinkablity: DANGEROUS! Very drinkable. I could drink lots of this, but would pay dearly for it. You would never guess the ABV until it hits you."
"Drinkability - Fantastic! Smooth and balanced. Another great one from Bell's!"
"Drinkability- This is the best beer I've had since I've moved back to Chicago. It's a semi hop bomb, semi a fruity delight! The honey adds a nice touch of dryness in the finish that you really don't expect and it's an all around terrifically done beer. Now I understand all the scramble to snag as much of this stuff as possible! Big thanks again to Matt and Brent!!"
"Rerate of fresh bottle. Much more vibrant hop character, obviously, along with big fruity bittersweet apricot and floral flavors. Still very drinkable, and brimming with flavor. One of my favorites."
"D- Very drinkable, goes down easy. Can be dangerous with its ABV."
"Hopslam pours a hazy, light, amber honey color with a small head that leaves a bit of lacing on the side of the snifter. The smell is very strong, mainly consisting of bright, citrussy hopes. Mostly grapefruit aromas with an underlying bit of honey. The taste starts with a very, very brief bit of sweetness followed a powerful punch of hop bitterness that knocks your socks off but slowly fades away to a soft bitter aftertaste. As the beer warms, the bitterness calms down, the alcohol starts to show up, and the flavors smooth out a bit. The mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied. This is a tasty hop-bomb, though maybe not quite as good as the hype led me to believe."
"Fantastic double IPA, it wrecks you though. Mouthfeel is utterly like butter in you're mouth with it's pleasent hints of floral and suttle tones of the bitter. It does punch you in the mouth and really kicks you in the rear when the alcohol sneaks up on you down the line. After about 3 of these I was pretty well off and yet I found myself ordering more. A FINE example of what a DIPA can be, I feel it's better than two-hearted but thats a matter of opinion! :)"
"D: In yo face IPA. Very bitter, but the body balanced it out. Very strong hop characteristics. I was impressed!"
"A very easy-drinking big DIPA. As the last swallow is consumed all you can think of is """I'd love to do another!""" A must try for ALL hopheads!"
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: I actually liked this beer a LOT better when I had it on tap. I really wished this tasted as good as it smelled. I do enjoy my hops, but I prefer more balance between the bitter and floral/citrus varietals. Although I do enjoy this offering, I'm not sure how many I could have in one sitting before the 10% ABV caught up with me. That being said, would I have it again? Absolutely. I look forward to picking it up next year and working it in with my other IPA/DIPAs."
"Overall this was very drinkable and a hell of a good beer, and as some others have said, it may take more than one of these to realize some of the nuances, and fully appreciate the beer."
""
"Overall this is a great buy, try it now!"
"Drinkability: Excellent. Could enjoy a few of these."
"D: Very drinkable DIPA !!!"
"Overall, it is an awesome DIPA. It lives up to the style beautifully, and will always give me the blast of hops I often crave. Too bad it is only brewed once a year."
"Tasted 3/18/08."
"Overall: Are you suprised Bell's has made another great beer, I'm not. It's a true DIPA that drinks like an IPA. It is sooo smooth it goes down like water, eh, more like nectar. It is a wonderful brew that should be sought out. It truly is in a class of its own."
"I fear that I may miss this beer as the hop shortage continues."
"I could definitely drink this brew year round, but I would place 90 Minute IPA as well as Nugget Nectar above this beer."
"Good beer. A fine IPA, and original/unique flavors. It was just a bit sweet and tropical for my ipa tastes."
"This is a great beer. What a joy for hop heads. Bell's has managed to bottle pure hop extract."
"Drinkability- This is a very noteworthy beer. It's something to be appreciated and treated right. It's great to slow down and enjoy a beer that is a work of art. That being said, I couldn't have more than one or two in a night. It's 10% ABV is not lost on me."
"DANGEROUSLY DRINKABLE. This beer is more complex than merely huge. Aroma and taste are like a palette of hop flavors, making me wonder what varieties were used. The best characteristic of this beer is that I taste the best aspects of hops without the drawbacks (extreme bitterness, pith flavor, etc.), and that the subtle sweetness perfectly tempers the rawness of the hops. I only have this bottle at the moment, or I would be sorely tempted to crack another. I only dock half a point from the drinkability because more than a couple might knock one off one's barstool. Highly recommended."
"Wow what a great beer here. One of the characteristics of an IPA is the strong presence of hops. This beer has them in there. It pours an amber color and has very little head. The first thing you will notice with this beer is aroma. My god it is a heavenly smell. It is very much a flowery bouquet in there. Now I have not yet learned my hops by smell but I am sure more experienced beer lovers could pick out the hops used in this brew just based on the smell. It has a smooth and sweet taste. One that makes drinking more than one very easy to take down. However, that is not good as it 10% ABV. So it's pretty easy to get drunk off this beer, which is a shame. This is a beer that should be enjoyed slowly to savor all that is have to offer."
"At 10% ABV, even a lunatic would have a hard time downing a bunch of pints... then again if it where a all-afternooner, I'd try."
"D: 10% ? I never would have guessed it. I could drink this all night."
"The scent of the beer is amazing. Lots of citrus and even some floral hops. I also detect quite a bit of spice. My mouth is watering just smelling this! The taste is wonderful; the malts are more upfront than I remember, not that it's a bad thing, but I distinctly remember the hops being the focus on the last one I had. My palate could be messed up so who knows. Had it not have been for the 10% ABV I could drink this beer all night. Instead I suppose I'll just have to pace myself a little better!"
"Drinkability - Overall good. IIPA not my favorite style, not use to the hoppy flavor, but this beer was tasty and makes me want to keep drink it to get use to the style."
"This is a VERY drinkable beer. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I'd dare say this should be a session beer. If you asked me to compare this to Dreadnaught, I'd say this one ekes it out by a nose because of it's finish and smaller bottle size."
"DRINKABILITY> Not an monstrous hop bomb, but one of the more extreme beers I've tasted nonetheless. warm and 'exotic'. This comes as close to a 'session' DIPA I've ever tasted, never a hint of alcohol comes through. Right up my alley, this is creme de la creme."
"2008 version (10% ABV) Pours a golden bronze with a thick, creamy two and a half finger head. Dull clarity with excellent retention and spectacular spiderweb lacing. The nose is truly amazing- heavy pine needle scent with robust tangerine/mango tropical hop oil aroma, some orange and grapefruit rind in the background; and a soild caramel malt backing. There is another sweet aroma here I could not place, but when I noticed that the label says it is brewed with honey, I found that to be a likely culprit. The first sip reveals the honey further- like clover with a touch of orange blossom- the malt tastes like a medium roast crystal with some two-row thrown in for good measure. Thankfully, the sweetness carries over into the aftertaste and attempts some kind of balance. The first wave of hop flavor is a pungent mix of pine sap-tangy ripe fruit; followed by fresh cut grass and oranges, and finally grapefruit and resinous earthy hop oils and cling to the tounge but in a very soft- low cohumulone sort of way. This beer is bursting with both malt and hop flavor- especially american """C"" varieties like Cascade, Chinook, Columbus and Centennial; yet is does not overwhelm the taste buds with boistrious alpha acids or astringent bitterness like some other hop bombs. This beer presents a unique and charismatic malt profile set against a showcase of west coast hop volatiles. The body is full and the carbonation light- just enough to prevent cloying and lift some of the more stubborn hop residues. It finishes flashy and saturated with the taste of fresh hop cones dipped in honey and copper-colored malt. The flavor is balanced enough to achive a good drinkability despite the heavy mouthfeel and lingering flavors. This limited availability seasonal is elite amongst it's D.I.P.A. bretheren, but still not worth the $16.00 a six pack price tag- hop crisis be damned."
"Mouthfeel is thick and oily. This is probably an easy drinker for most hopheads. Maybe too easy, considering it weighs in at 10%. Check this one out. It's another winner from Bell's."
"It is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, and I could have gone for some more carbination. Other than that, it was a very solid brew."
"D- This beer definately has a """drink me""" factor going on. Very enjoyable."
"can you say slow and reflective? say it s l o w and then s l o w it down some more... this is the equivilant of hopped wine. the hoppiet barley wine I have ever tasted. And the taste! and the smell! strong resins predominate, a lemony piney, citrusy balm that lingers in the nose and contributes to a most amazing taste. You are drinking a wonderfully balanced but strong, nuanced but powerful beer. One of the best beers that I have had so far in 2008. Wonderful. Don't drink it all night unless you can nurse a bottle for several hours. given the complexity of this beer, that is indeed possible. Savor a sublime, deep taste sensation."
"Hopslam is good, and drinkable, but ultimately doesn't bring a lot new to the table. It's simply a good Double IPA; but there's nothing wrong with that, either. Recommended for those with a hop-tooth."
"Drinkability: Well, two or three pints of this will get you where you need to be really fast, I would start with one then move on to something a little less intense on the Abv...all around excellent beers. Without a doubt one of my favorites."
"this is a fantastic beer. something i will go out and buy a case of. highly recommend."
"Thanks to Sephiroth for this gem! Pours a fairly clear orange color with a timy white head. It leaves slight lacing down the glass. This IMO (along with NN) has the best aroma of any beer I have ever tried. Huge amounts of floral and citrus hops invade upon my first and every sniff. Massive citrus hop flavor, but not a typical hop monster- this fades as it gets balanced with the honey flavor. Very drinkable medium bodied beer for 10%! Can't wait for more!!"
"I was expecting a typical hop bomb, which is still a good thing, but this is different. The hoppiness is definitely there but mellowed out somewhat by the honey, making it the most drinkable beer I've ever had at 10% abv. I can't buy it locally and I'm wishing I had more. Phenomenal."
"If this beer wasn't 10% alcohol I could drink it all day."
"Excellent drinkability, not too dry, too strong or too sweet. Lots of hops. The balance in this one makes me want to drink it all night, but at the same time the hops are huge. Well done Bell's, too bad I can't afford much of this stuff."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange color with a one finger white head. The smell hits you as you pour. Smells of pine and citrus hops with a sweet fruity scent somewhat like white wine. The taste is again pine and citrus hops but the sweetness is very strong. Taste of grape and honey that really balances out the hops. There is some alcohol burn in the finish but isn't unpleasant. The mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Overall I really liked this one even though I usually don't like big hops. This one was balanced well and really impressed me."
"If you call yourself a hop head then you must seek out this big, brutally bitter beer. I have yet to try a beer that comes closer to capturing the essence of American hops."
"D - Great beer. Enjoy!"
"D: Don't drink too many of these at 9.3 abv, but definitely a treat to be had once in awhile."
"This is easily drinkable for 1-2 - gets a little heavy on the back end. Overall, extremely well-made."
"D - Loving it. The many mixed fruit flavors mix seamlessly with the hops. A very well put together DIPA that brings all the vrashness one expects from the style, but does have a unique feature that almost resembles balance which we all know is not a benchmark characteristic for the style. Just makes you want more."
"D: Yes please! The whole package delivers, a nice brew (or two) to cap off a work week. Just full of flavor."
"If you have a chance to try this on-tap, definitely do so. In the bottle it is great but on-tap it is much different. I found it much more hop scented with less bitterness. (It's funny how sometimes bitterness and hoppiness are not the same.) It's much smoother on-tap, too."
"D-If you're a hophead check this one out, tastes great and smells great also."
"Drinkability: I don't know if Bell's needs to just do the worthwhile brews or not, but lately those have been the best for me. And this may be their best. A deliciously balanced hop attack, with way too much to admire, and much to look forward to, at least from my end, when it's released each year. It's pretty expensive for a 6-pack, from around $12 to $15, but it's worth it, and I'll continue to buy it when it's available. Does anyone else think it's time for Bell's to start releasing some vintage and special bombers? Stick to the craziness, Bell's... as the experience is much more worthwhile."
"This may be the best smelling beer I've ever had! The grapefruit aromas could be detected several feet away. Pours a golden, almost orange color - small head. Taste is fruity and hops, hops, hops. Lives up to it's name. Ultimately, it's on the bitter side, but quite drinkable nonetheless. This is a terrific beer (made by a terrific brewery). Keep 'em coming to SW Fl., Bells!"
"d: overall, a pretty high drinkability. my bottle says 10% abv, and I really taste no alcohol. I could get myself in a lot of trouble with a beer like this, if I wasn't careful. another delicious offering from a great brewery."
"d - this is high abv and intense in flavor. I was expecting something that was going to be hard to drink, but I think I'm getting used to hoppy beers. I really like the citrus and flower characteristics of IPA's so it was worth it for me to try this."
"I love this one. Surprisingly it was not ruined by all of the hype (and there certainly is enough of it.) As far as pushing limits, this is a winner for finding some way to balance the generally overpowering hop characteristics of other DIPA's."
"I truly believe that Bells is one of the best breweries in the country right now, and this beer helps prove my theory."
"Overall- It's a more balanced beer than the name would suggest. The big grain bill brings some equity to the big hop addition."
"A masterpiece of hops."
"Hopslam- it's bigger, and more West Coast. Tasty!"
"D- This is a very enjoyable DIPA but it didn't do anything magical for me. It would be near perfect if it tasted exactly how it smells-but it doesn't. The flavor is pretty good but didn't blow me away. The ABV is very well hidden here. The strengths definitely lie in the smell and mouthfeel of this one. Pretty good brew overall and one I will have again."
"Other than a rather unattractive body, this beer is perfect for the style."
"I was excited to try this, and after trading for it I am not a bit disappointed."
"Taste-- Sweet god, hops! It's almost like I got slammed with them... weird. For a very short period of time sweet flavors dance around on the tip of the tongue before getting obliterated by the oncoming Bitter Train. Leaves extremely pleasing hop flavors all over my mouth... citrus, sticky pine, etc... The carbonation certainly enhances the impact. Sticky malt backbone (barely) keeps things in check. Finishes bitter, with noticeable enough alcohol to know it's strong. An absolutely brutal hop assault that makes hopheads orgasm and lesser beer-folk weep."
"Overall, this beer goes down far too easily for its high ABV. Be careful! This is also on the expensive side (I paid $3 for a 12 oz bottle) but I wasn't disappointed. A little expensive to drink all the time, but was a very nice treat!"
"M&D: Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation and excellent drinkability. From the beginning of the experience this brew just screamed """fresh""" hops. Fantastic."
"I poured this brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was musty smelling and had a really thin head. The beer was a little bit cloudy and smelled really hoppy. It tasted really hoppy also as it is suppose to. I thought it was kinda grassy tasting. I did not like the beer but hop heads will go for it for sure. A great crisp summertime hop beer if you like that kinda thing. Not buy again"
"I get what all the ravings are about though, for hop heads this is like a dream beer. I'm a fan of hops, but not to the extent that I'd be seeking this out again... though maybe."
"This is a very good beer and a great example of a Double IPA. It's just not the best one I've ever had. The flavor and aroma are very good, but it doesn't hide its alcohol well, and that hurt it some, in my opinion. Still a great example of the style, and I would suggest buying some if you get the chance. Recommended."
"Ovr: I'm a big fan of DIPA's. I love the carmel quality the malt and alcohol add to balance the hop attack. This beer is very straight ahead. It's crisp, clean, has a great hop presence, is balanced almost perfectly, and adds something with the pineapple acidity. Maybe my favorite DIPA."
"A simply fantastic IPA. It really focuses on hop flavor rather than just being an IBU delivery device."
"12 oz'er poured into a pint glass... Pours a hazy gold, ambery color with a pretty thick and creamy white head. The head lasts all the way down for the most part, and leaves a bit of lacing. Smells of powerful hops, and it's really a great character, citrusy, bitter, and mellow, with some fruit. Tastes... well like a hopslam, great blend of hops in this beer, and the honey adds a flavorful undertone. Relatively carbonated, very fresh and """energetic""" mouthfeel. This beer is damn tasty and drinkable, I'd have no objection to crack open one after another. But 9.3% ABV would get involved..."
"D- Okay for 10% beer this hides the alcohol well. I really like this beer. I was expecting blow-your-face-off hops but I got a very balanced and delicious beer."
"I'm not usually one for overly hoppy beers, but for what it is, this one is pretty decent."
"Just phenomenal, HopSlam is exhausting my cache of superlatives, a bolder presentation away from perfection in my esteem, and even that is somewhat cosmetic."
"D-Top notch. This stuff was the hit at a tasting tonight where we experimented w/pairings. Try this stuff with some aged cheddar. Each one makes you want more of the other. You will get fat and drunk."
"I will definitely be buying more of this soon. As I have a newly-realized love for hops, this ranks high on my list."
"D - Drinkability is good. I am impressed with what they have done with this beer. The alcohol is hidden fairly well. If I could avoid passing out, I would definitely have several of these. Recommended."
"Nice mellow sweetness in this beer but the hops don't seem to balance with the malts. These strong pacific northwest hops really blast the taste buds! It is a delicious blend of hops and adds quite a hop character throughout the beer. I'd like to see it a bit maltier. I'd also like. Still a solid DIPA from Bell's."
"A little over the top, but that is good sometimes! A must try if you think you are a hophead."
"A beer worth its price indeed! At abt $16 a six pack this beer lives up to the hype...great label...great name...great brewery....great taste! I nice solid color for a DIPA; not too dark but not too light. a head that signals its hoppy nature. An explosion of flavor highlighted by the typical piney nature of an IPA but with a vibrant fruity taste. Four of these and I was inebriated! I had another IPA right before this and the stark difference was amazing. If you haven't had this beer....you have not had a Double IPA."
"D-This is one of those beers that could be classified as """dangerously""" drinkable. I could easily put down six of these, which is rare for me and a beer of this strength. I have to try hard to hold myself to one (maybe two)."
"In all I liked this beer, I would definitely get this one again. It is a pretty well balanced hop bomb."
"Poured into a snifter. Slightly hazy, pure amber color, that is almost nectar-like. Nice solid white head that dissipates and leaves a white ring around the glass. Aromas are sweet, honey, sweet citrus, along with earthy tones like grassy, floral, and piney from the hops. Tastes are sweet from the honey. Strong hop character; smokey hop flavors. Amazing DIPA! Great mouthfeel, smooth, and very palate pleasing, also a little creamy. Very drinkable, I am actually on my third."
"drinkability is decent. the amount of hops here lower the drinkability, but the smooth profile allow a few of these to make their way to the stomach without any problems. cheers!"
"D - Found the beer to be more drinkable after it warmed a bit. I could have another, but no more than that in one sitting. I will seek this out every year it is released."
"Poured a medium gold, small head, some lacing. The smell was mostly citrusy hops, but my smell is not refined enough to tell which. The taste was rather amazing. I expected this beer to be much hoppier than it seemed, but the hop flavor was indeed quite pronounced, and was balanced with a very sweet malt flavor. To contradict the reviewers below, it did indeed taste rather alcoholic to me, but then again, well, it is! HopSlam was certainly no chugger for me but I really enjoyed sipping it over the course of 30 minutes or so."
"Pours amber with a thin head but a constant stream of tiny bubbles. I'm not worried about a big head for a strong beer like this, I'm more concerned about what the beer tastes like and how fresh it is. This is one fresh beer! The smell is surprisingly malty and a tad sweet with big citrusy hops following. The taste is amazing! Delicious blend of citrusy and piney hops with a spicy oiliness that coats the tongue and has a flavor almost of cinnamon in its intensity. More pine, grapefruit, and orange follow. The sweet malt and honey play a supporting role that beautifully props up the hops, and there is almost a peach flavor at the end that makes me want to guzzle the beer. Great body, balance, and finish. I know this is 9.3% abv, but you can't tell. Something about this beer makes me want another and nothing else as soon as I finish the first, Uber delicious and almost addictive."
"Hopslam is outstanding on tap and very good in the bottle!!"
"If you're a hop fanatic, I can't really imagine a better beer. And I am one, so it works out well. The appearance is good, although not really mind-blowing. Nice copper-amber color with a finger of white head on top that leaves a touch of lacing as the beer drains. Nose is incredible. Tons of piney hops hit you first, then a good bit of candy sweet malt as well. Unlike a lot of DIPAs, this one is definitely hop leaning; Bell's didn't seem to pour on the malt to balance it out, but really allowed the hops to dominate the flavor. But in a good way. Taste is amazing. Tons of piney hops again, some sweet caramel malt, grapefruit, and a touch of decidedly biting sweetness (some reviewers called it pineapple). The ABV is incredibly well hidden - not even noticeable in the least. Body is perfect for the style. Not syrupy, but thick and full bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. One of the best DIPAs I've had, along with Southern Tier's Unearthly Imperial IPA and Dogfish Head's 120 (which is a much sweeter beer). Really a great one."
"Drinkability: Extremely hoppy, but it still displays a relatively good balance."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and carbonation is very good. At nearly 10% abv, it's strong, but extremely smooth and drinkable. Due to its strength, I wouldn't have more than one or two in a sitting. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Nice to find it on tap at Brews."
"Bell's HopSlam pours dark orange with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There's no mistaking the aroma, it's hops, citrus, especially grapefruit stand out. The flavor is the same, all hops all the time. Citrusy and once again grapefruit like. A hopheads delight. Recommended."
"If this beer is sold in your area, pick it up fast! while it still lasts."
"It poured well into my crystal snifter a copper read with about an inch of foamy white head. There was evidence of lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was sharp with an over-abundance of hops and citrus notes. The taste was bitter, but not over-whelming and sweet with the addition of honey. With an ABV of 10% this is definitely not a session beer, but more adequately a night cap. Kudos to Bell's for such a fine ale."
"D...Careful this beer is deceiving, it is certainly not alcohol apparent ."
"Slightly creamy mouth to the finish, this is defniitely a sipper-due to abv and the taste-bud-blowing hops, but i could definitely go for another one tomorrow."
"Dark orange and hazy in color. Small head that doesn't hang on long but a decent about of bubbles (not too many but not too little) stick around the edges and a clean even lacing on the glass (note: I hardly ever mention lacing on these little blurbs but this is Hop Slam. Every little nuance is part of it's charm). The smell is VERY sweet and sour citrusy tang, one of those marihootchie strains that's got it's own name, a walk in a northern Michigan woods on a nice late spring day and a understated malt backbone. Upfront in the taste grapefruit. Before I go any farther if you don't like grapefruit-this isn't for you. Personally though, they're part of my breakfast at least twice a week so I'm right at home having this as the evenings night cap. That dry sour that gives you pucker power. There's definitely a combination of at least a few different hops given this a distinct character. Crisp with a nice medium body in the mouth. Leaves a slight sting on the tongue that lingers but down the throat is smooths all out with the honey and the malt giving a warm sweetness in the finish with a bit of alcohol burn to remind you that this is over 9% abv and 106 IBU's."
"D - Anytime anywhere. Watch out though, this one will sneak up on you and brutally beat you BMTH style. This is probably one of the most amazing beers I've ever had. Reco without a doubt."
"Another big props to trader jdoncbus... John we must again work something out... Now I just wish I had access to all the fantastic hoppy wonders you do... lucky bastard."
"I can't say I'd drink it all the time; It's expensive, it's pummels my pallet, and I cant eat spicy food all the time."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color. The smell really reminds me of pineapple juice with a hint of hops in there. The taste isn't what I really expected. I expected more of a Smuttynose IPA type beer. The taste was pleasant though, tasted sweet like a fruit juice with the hop bitterness. Extremely easy on the mouth, no bite at all. not sure I'd want 6 in a row, but 2 or 3?, definitely"
"This one is well balanced for a hop bomb bitter yet sweet enough to make it extremely drinkable although 10% might be a good reason to keep them to a minimum"
"If you can get this, get it. If you can't, you really should start looking."
"D: Highly recommended. It's so well balanced with sweet malts and floral, piney hops. And it's extremely drinkable, I could put down a couple in minutes I think. Body is a bit light, but that's my only qualm here."
"Drinkability: At 9% abvI would'nt call it a session beer at all, but great to start off or on a hot day. I actually ate some m&ms right after drinking it and the hoppy aftertaste mixed with the chocolate was fantastic."
"Got this beer on tap at my local haunt and just had to try it due to my love of hoppy beers. The appearance of this beer is a light copper with a nice white head. The smell was very similar to other beers like this, very citrusy hop smell, but also had a sweet undertone. The taste of this beer is amazing. From the smell, you expect to be overpowered with hops flavor, but it is surprisingly smooth and had a slight caramel taste. This beer has a pretty hefty ABV , so you don't want to drink too many of them in one sitting. But, if you like hoppy beers, this is definitely one to try."
"Draft. Pours a cloudy Amber with small off white head. The Aroma has lots of citrus especially grapefruit. The flavor is full of hops but also has a nice sweetness. This beer has real depth with fruit and caramel in the flavor. The finish is not to bitter and lingers nicely. Really nice and incredibly drinkable for a Double IPA. I need to comapare this head to head with 90 minute IPA"
"D - Thank god I don't have a chilled 6 pack of this one...LOL."
"This beer poured copper color with a .5""" head which thinned quickly. The smell is very nice with with fruitiness and some of alcohol. The taste is great with hints of grapefruit and orange. This is now my favorite high alcohol (10%) beer mainly because it hides the higher alcohol with the intense hop citrus flavor. This beer is very good!"
"How is this different than the double bastard I had right before it? Well... The DB has more bitter to balance the sweetness. It also has a much much darker color. And the bitterness... Has a different quality to it. This one is like drinking fuggles. Which is fine, and all, but tastes like an IPA. The DB... Has a deeper feeling to it - more breadth and a better bitter quality. I guess... IMO... The DB comes across like an American barleywine should. This one comes across as an IPA."
"A very well balanced DIPA, I can't even make out that it's 10% alcohol, so that bodes quite well for this beer."
"D - Highly drinkable DIPA. Goes down very easy for 10%. Got to love Bells, got to love Hopslam. Can't find a single thing to fault. Favorite beer to date."
"Drink this as fresh as possible!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Poured a golden color with orangish hue and foamy white head nice lacing. Smell is dominated by citrus and pine hint of pineapple. Taste is dominated by grapefruit with some pine resin but not as bitter as a lot of DIPA because of its sweet malt base. Mouthfeel is creamy and a low carbonation feel but still carbonated. A pretty drinkable double IPA."
"Label says 10% ABV...sure doesn't drink like it, but it does tend to sneak up on you."
"Im eager as hell to get my hands on some more of these bad boys. I could live off this and the two-hearted, Bells to jersey please."
"Overall this is a good solid delightfully hoppy beer."
"Final Note: my taste buds are numb and I'm a happy camper."
"Taste is abundantly rich with grapefruity and piney hops, some caramel malt sweetness, and something a bit more tropically sweet. Just an absolutely superb DIPA."
"This puckering brew is bold and daring. The alcohol makes itself known, but still holds up on drinkability for the sheer pleasure of it all. A hop-head's delight!"
"I traveled nearly 200 miles round trip for a case of this beer. Overall I feel the trip was worth every second. Hopslam has an aroma that is compared to none. IT packs a nice punch but at the same time it has an equal hop/malt profile. One sip is not enough. Enjoy!!!"
"D - really one of the better DIPAs I've ever had and especially drinkable given the price for the style. Definitely a beer worth 14 bucks a six pack and like having one of this style in a small bottle since I don't have to think hard about whether I want to drink a whole bomber or not. Really a beer I would reach more over and over again and thinking maybe I should have bought a whole case if I didn't have so much beer already. If you can find some definitely worth picking up a sixer and enjoying it as soon as possible so that you get the full hop profile."
"Probably the best IPA/DIPA I've had the pleasure of trying."
"D: Top notch. I was exposed to many differnt options of amazing beer on tap and could not leave this one. After two on an empty stomach getting thrown back fast, maybe it's too drinkable."
"*note* Have not tried this beer out of a bottle yet."
"D - One of the best DIPA I have ever had. Pretty high abv at 10% but hidden very well. I would get this one again"
"Drinkability is great for such high alcohol. Alcohol is hidden well, flavors are great and mouthfeel just bumps it that much further. An incredibly drinkable double IPA."
"Great DIPA. Will probably pick up a 6 pack of this."
"M & D: Thick and slick... quite an oily consistency that leaves its residue like a thin film before slipping into a clean finish. Makes it very easy to drink, but the alcohol is amazingly well hidden, so restraint needs to be exercised to avoid getting clobbered by it. Respect it, and it will treat you very well."
"Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs I have had. Strong and flavorful, while still maintaining drinkabilty. Great beer. Will seek out again. $15 a six does hurt a touch though."
"D - A very good double IPA, but I wouldn't want to drink this all the time, as it is a bit much. Nice once in a while however."
"Incredibly drinkable, especially for a 9.3 percent brew. The alcohol is an afterthought: the taste, mouthfeel and resfreshing experience beckon for more. Truly an exceptional Imperial IPA and another fine effort from the folks at Bells."
"I will be getting more of next year's version!!!"
"Notes - I find it very hard to fault this beer in any way. Exceptional stuff."
"A great seasonal DIPA that I eagerly look forward to every year. Worth the wait!!"
"This is now my new favorite beer. So sad I only have three from a trade and none to buy. They will not last long in this house."
"d- solid ale, ill still take furious when i can but this is very good"
"-Oelergud"
"One of my favorite releases. The first time I had it was on draft, but this review was from this years release in a bottle poured into a pilsner glass. Im a hophead, so I am a tad biased. Very well done for a DIPA, so you match this up with Two-Hearted and Bell's could go toe to toe with Dogfish Head for my favorite IPAs."
"This beer really lives up to the Bells reputation. The taste is exceptional and it goes down smooth. There aren't a lot of bubbles, but what there are tickles the tongue. It's flavor is of course hoppy (is that a word?) and a little like pine with an aftertaste similar to grapefruit. It's hard to taste the high amount of alcohol in this"
""
"I'd been wondering when this beer was going to make it to NC and it finally did. It poured a bright gold color with a small head that stuck around. Aroma was hops, hops and more hops. This is a hophead's dream come true. I could pick up a good bit pf pine, citrus and even a hint of mango in the aroma as well. Taste was bitter up front with some alcoholic warmth mixed in. The finish was also bitter. The sweetness of the malt was there, but the high level of hop bitterness overwhelmed it at every turn, which was fine with me. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Drinkability was excellent, however, non-hopheads would probably find this beer undrinkable. Anyone who favors Double IPA's should seek this one out."
"Mmmm...freshly squeezed hop juice."
"Pours a murky orange with a decent off white head. Nose is strong citrus hops. Flavor is so much grapefruit, it took me back a bit. Those thick citrus flavors are combined with firm hop tones. Feel is smooth on liquid and carbonation and it goes down easy. Nice to drink, though the citrus is a bit high. I am not sure if I remember it being like this when I had it on bottles a while ago."
"Note as of 5/9/08: Get this as fresh as you possibly can. There is some notable atrophy in the hop zestiness even after 3 -4 months. It's still a killer, but it has fallen off a step."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a mixture of pine and citrusy hops. In the taste, primarily piney hops and just a hint of citrusy hops. A small bite, yet a mostly smooth mouthfeel, and a dry piney hop aftertaste. Big on piney hops and actually not as bitter as anticipated. Hides the alcohol and very, very good."
"Overall experience: It's a nice treat. It's a simple concept beer. One done well. I love being ablre to get some when it's seasonal release takes place."
"The Bell's Boyz did it again....even though last year's - 2007 - was better!"
"Drinkability: Very high. This is one of the best DIPA's I have had. Very strong and tasty but very easy to drink at the same time. Great job by Bells."
"A complex range of everything from lemon, oregano, sage, rose, a little pine, just all over the place. Basically no malt in the aroma, but who cares, this one is about the hops! On the palate it just explodes. The bitterness of the hops is really explosive, there's just enough malty sweetness to keep it from being a real bruiser. The alcohol is quite noticeable, and it also enhances the bitterness. Carbonation is appropriate, and there is no slickness in this brew, body is rather low, a bit over attenuated perhaps? No matter, this is one beer to drink now, and despite it's high cost ($15 6er), it is worth it."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth for a DIPA. A lot are very raw and harsh. This is almost too easy to drink, and at 10% I was done for the night after two. Good thing I still have four more."
"o -- Wow it just pops and explodes hops all over this is a spectacular DIPS im glad every one around here carries it my wife also loved the beer describing it as yummy."
"Sweet Jeebus, I have been waiting for this stuff to come back since the day I ran out last year. I must remember not to share any with my roommates this time. Live and learn. Sometimes greed is permissable. So, how is the 'o8 batch? Let's begin. Pours burnt gold into the chalice. The head, while it is there, serves as a nice marshmallow contrast to the rich hues of the beer's body. Immeadiately I can smell this sucka'. A good foot and a half and it is still unmistakable and plain as day. Yup, this is the Hopslam I remember. Deep floral aromatics with a sweet underpining of succulant malt. And yeah, even the honey notes dance around. Ugh, just delicious. And I haven't even tasted it yet. Wow, the hops literally race all around the perimeter of the tongue with spicy, resinous pitchforks, prodding at the sides and back of my buds while the heavy malt body cooly slides down the middle of the mouth. The balance on this bottle of jet fuel is stunning. It's drinkability is surely many a mother's ruin. THough a raging 10% a.b.v. it is nowhere to be found. Mmmmm, must buy more. I wonder how much blood I need to sell on a weekly basis to keep this in the fridge while supplies last? If you just skipped down to the end of this review, the bottom line is this is GOOD. And if you don't like it, no problem. More for me to buy. Cheers."
"This is a damn fine beer. One of the tastiest DIPAs you'll ever find."
"Thanks Nephilium!!!"
"The best citrus oriented hop brew out there in my opinion and one of the best overall beers as well. I look forward to this stuff coming out every year with a feverish enthusiasm. One of the best beers out there period. If you've never tried it, make it a point to buy/trade for it ASAP. If you're a hop head like me you won't be able to get enough."
"update: 2009 batch - this time around seems to be better than last year for me. pineapple abounds, and it is just silky smooth deliciousness. what a beer!!!"
"Honey - dark honey. Honey-amber? Thin off-white head. Aroma of green wet hops. Flavors of floral hops, apricot, and sweet grains. The honey added is well integrated - not too sweet, and it seems to lend a silky mouthfeel, or maybe I'm being misled. Alcohol is in check - not much intrusion. Good stuff. Two Hearted Ale meets the Incredible Hulk."
"Another wonderful beer from Bell's. This beer is nirvana for anyone who loves hops."
"The flavor doesn't disappoint, either. Sticky, bitterly sharp hops coat the mouth and deliver a puckering blow to the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and heavy, but not so thick or viscious that it's hard to consume or stomach. The bitter finish is the bread-winner here -- this is what hop-lovers crave. (Oh man, even my burps smell good...nice and hoppy.) The alcohol pairs well with the greenery to give the aftertaste a memorable bite. Although I had no qualms about paying $11.99 for a six pack of Hopslam, a little voice in the back of my mind had its doubts about the hype. That little voice belonged to the man on the label of this beer, Slammed under the weight of massive hops. Rock on, Bell's."
"Thanks again to my buddy Aaron for having some kin-folk in MI to bring this down for me."
"The body is full and a bit sticky. Appropriate carbonation, and very drinkable for the strength. Perhaps it is because of experience with this beer, but I find myself usually only having one. Maybe I am subconsciously trying to help out the hop shortage, as I could easily see myself having another one or two of these before losing my ability to type. Highly recommended."
"batch 8277"
"I had this last year and tought it was so so but I must say my pallette must be maturing because I absolutely loved this years offering..Helping was the fact this is FRESH..This had a cat piss litterbox nose but when you drink it the clean hops jump right out at you with a surprising easy drinkibility..Not over the top on anything and this delivers a clean freshness...Like walking outside on a ski slope with pines around fresh air. The alcohol is WELL HIDDEN and you can find yourself in trouble in a hurry at almost 10% and the easy drinkibility of this one! AWESOME..Hats off Larry you nailed this one!"
"Yes this is a good beer. This worth buying a sixer if you are a singles buyer. I would make this a staple in my beer fridge if it was available more often. I hope I can find this on tap. There is a lot of hype to this brew and it is justified. Not the end all be all, but very good."
"I want another...now!!!"
"BLUF-this is a beer that you should seek out. Well worth it."
"I do like this beer, It hits the spot if you have a hop craving, but in truth it is not that much of a brewing accomplishment if you ask me, very one-dimensional, and for the price there are better DIPAs out there. That being said, it is has certainly accomplished what it set out to do."
"D- A pretty drinkable DIPA... though the stickiness limits it from being amazing."
"Overall, an outstanding beer. It's positives are the strong aromas and fabulous hoppy flavors. The negatives are the lack of a strong malty profile and the slightly thin body. Ultimately, this is an excellent DIPA and I will be drinking it again and again."
"This one is nice but not a must have."
"Popping the top - grapefruit, pine and canteloupe. I'm used to the other scents but canteloupe is a new one. This pours a shade of amber I associate with the containment of prehistoric bugs. The taste is heavy on the grapefruit - and I like that end of the DIPA spectrum - with plenty of apricot, orange peel and a nice hot spicy background that reminds of Belgian IPA's. Not much of a malty body to start, but becomes a bit more prominent as this warms up and helps prop up the fruity bitterness. This finishes a bit dry for my liking and is a little lacking in layers. It's also a little medicinal on the very tail end, which is unfortunately what lingers. Even so, I keep coming back for another smell and sip. And another. If it weren't for the slightly unpleasant notes creeping in at the 11th hour, this might be toward the top of my DIPA list. Big thanks to Hoppymeal for the chance to try this (as an extra no less! karma). In spite of qualms, I'll come back if I see this on shelves."
"Excellent carbonation and definitely quite a bit of body to this one. Strangely I have never had a beer that could feel so creamy yet so dry and crisp at the same time. For a DIPA approaching 10% I had absolutely no problems finishing this and the only reason I decided on a Two-Hearted afterwards was that I still had to drive home."
"Apparently, I didn't like it as much as most. Still a tasty beer."
"Arrived in a tumbler style glass with very little white head resting on top. Burnt orange color that is a little cloudy. Aroma is pure hoppy goodness. Plenty of citrus with grapefruit punching my nostrils followed by a little pineapple and mango, with maybe a little of pine, spicy hops. Taste is extremely balanced. I get a bitter aftertaste but that is first met with a strong malty sweetness. Moutfeeling is just right for this style. Not a lot of carbonation, but not flat at all. Had this beer with some spicy wings, it was perfect."
"Edit a few years later. This one grows on me and is just great stuff. A touch too much alcohol and not the best carbonation and body, but that doesn't hurt this one at all."
"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle into my tulip glass. Appearance is solid, though not exceptional. Pure amber color with a minimal head and lacing. However, its unexceptional look is deceiving. Upon raising the tulip to my nose, I am greeted with one of the most sensational aromas my two nostrils have ever beheld. Absolutely unadulterated hops. Delicious fruity smells such as grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Crisp pine smells also sing their songs. Lying underneath all of this is honey. Rarely does a beer leave me in such awe before even taking my first sip. Taste does not disappoint. Hops like crazy. Super unbalanced, but really, a malt presence would just get in the way here. Mouthfeel is surprisingly perfect for this. It's nice and light considering the punch it packs. Great carbonation. Really, I wouldn't change this one bit. Extremely drinkable. This is a work of art."
"M/D: Carbonation is there but in appropriate quantities, slight creaminess to a light to medium body and some big hop oiliness that coats the mouth. Drinkability is good on this one. A very fine example of the style."
"As another reviewer has said, it is like biting into a grapefruit. The malt does slightly balance the hops but let's face it, the hops are the star of this show. I sense alcohol in the taste as well the warming affect. I think it adds another dimension in this beer. A cleansing action to the hops. I can feel the carbonation is low but it is like the hops just make the beer """pop""" on the tongue and makes it tingle. Medium body and a slight oily feel. The first beer goes down nicely, the second is slower, and then you suffer from palate fatigue and you might as well stop drinking this one for the day(not to mention the ABV). I bought a 6-pack and I will enjoy it over a few days."
"Drinkability was good for what it was, but i wont be slamming a sixer any day soon."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thick from all the malt they had to use to get this one up over 9%, but the drinkability on this one is excellent. A very bold and tasty beer, i could have definately had another if i had bought more than one."
"One can not write a review of this beer without mentioning the citrus hoppiness. The first time I sampled this brew last year I was knocked on my ass by how fruity it was. This year's batch is most welcome in my small collection. One thing I noticed, and this might just be me, but this year it seems a little more bitter, which seems to hide some of the citrus the more I drink. Maybe it's just palate fatigue, but by the end of the beer I don't get as much hop flavor as I would like, and thus the bitterness and the alcohol start coming through."
"D-Only had a couple, but could see myself downing 3-4 no problem."
"One of my favorites, this Double IPA shines through with a clear amber color that is more translucent than expected. The smell bombards your nose with hops and citrus undertones and a touch of malts. The taste slams your toungue with bitter hop tones that consist of grapefruit, pine, coriander, pineapple and a small backstop of malts. Wonderfully strong, great mouthfeel, and I would conclude that the drinkablitly for this beer (for me) is high."
"This is a tasty, impressive beer for hop lovers and fresh is the way to go."
"If you love hops you will absolutely fall in love with this beer and the great balance it achieves."
"Overall a great double IPA that brings a neat vegetal slant to the show. The flavors are not the (soon to be) typical Dbl. IPA 'big grapefruit' and fusel alcohol that seem to be coming out of the woodwork these days. Bell's wasn't one of the first micros to brew a dbl. IPA, but it seems as if they were waiting for the market to get used to this big IPA frenzy, THEN introduce HopSlam and disrupt the blanket perception of what this stuff is really supposed to taste like. I guess I'm trying to say this is a very original, BALANCED but very bitter/hoppy IPA with world class written all over it. I really want to pair this with a rustic salmon and field greens salad."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a tight bright white one finger cap on it. The head fades fairly quickly, but leaves decent spotty lacing on my imperial pint glass. It is actually a little clearer than Two-Hearted which I find a little surprising. I can smell this beer as I pour it. It smells like I have hop cones under my nose. Pink grapefruit and resinous pine hit my nose with the power of a Roy Jones Jr. punch. There is a decent smell of pineapple coming though as well. Fresh citrus fruit and a deep pine flavor hit your palate up-front with a dry sweetness finishing off the beer on the back of the mouth. There is some slight sweet malt coming to the palate, but is pushed around by the heavy hop flavors and takes a back seat in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. The high carbonation leaves a very dry sensation on your tongue. The drinkability is a little hampered by the high ABV and dry sensation, but is very high for just a beer or two."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden orange with a 1 cm off white head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is brutally strong, piney and a little citrus. Initial flavor is balanced between the sweet malts and hugely bitter hops. Flavor of grapefruit is what i get the most of. Aftertaste is very dry from all the hops. Light to medium mouthfeel, almost no lacing, almost no carbonation, and the alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable if you are a hophead, but for the rest of us its still worth a try."
"D-- i wish i could drink this bad boy all day long..i wanna wake up to it and go to sleep with it...but at around 10 percent it whoops your but pretty fast.. so take it easy or you might hurt yourself or even your taste buds will end up bruised..."
"Just to clarify, """drinkability""" is the subjective appeal of a beer, not to be mistaken for """chuggability.""" One of these is plenty, but I love drinking this outstanding beer. Wow!"
"Extremely enjoyable and drinkable for the style, with a nice dry quality and intense hoppy, relatively balanced taste. Not so drinkable if you plan on consuming more than one or two, and definitely not if you don't like bitterness and hops."
"This beer is the current Holy Grail in PA, if not everywhere. I was thrilled to come across it at one of our favorite beer bars. It lives up to the high expectations!"
"D- A great DIPA, balanced, flavorful, with extremely well-masked alcohol, there is a good deal of sweetness that keeps the hops in check, I wouldn't exactly put this is the 'hop bomb' category, but this DIPA can stand up in terms of flavor to some of my SoCal DIPA favorites"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability suffers somewhat from high IBU's , sweetness and ABV , but it's an enjoyable beer."
"Orange amber is color small head quickly dissipates to foamy islands. Great aroma as soon as the bottle is opened. I had high hopes for this IPA and I am not at all disappointed. Tons of floral grapefruit hop aroma with taste to match. Nice malt backbone gives it a just right sweetness to support the hoppy bitterness. I think candied orange best describe the middle of the taste. Finish is very hoppy and bitter. This is my kind of IPA, massive aroma and taste, full mouthfeel. Great drinkability."
"When I consider every aspect of this beer separately, they are all great but in the end I'm left feeling like it all doesn't quite add up for me and I can't place what it is. Somewhere in the finish and aftertaste I'm left with a thin/watery feeling that I can't place, hence the lower drinkability score. I'd love to try this on tap after my experience of liking two-hearted much better on tap than bottled"
"D: Very tasty and well worth the wait. I'm glad I have a case of this."
"Solid body with biting but not overdone carbonation. Hop resin is detectable but is still acceptable for a brew with this type of IBUs. Delicious but the tongue-punishing hop level limits the drinkability. Not sure this lives up to the hype but I'm glad to see Bells notching up a big beer that doesn't fall under the stout banner."
"D: Awesome brew. Fresh is the way to go with this bad boy. I will also enjoy laying one down to see what happens."
"All in all HopSlam 08 is very good but the bar was set so high that it does not measure up to last years offering. I expected the same beer Bells offered up last year and that did not happen. This version is thinner and not as well balanced so whatever alterations were made to the recipe should be corrected because it isn't as good as the first release and that is a shame."
"Batch 8278 purchased 01/11/2008."
"I had been waiting for this release for a while now and it was well worth the wait. The case I bought may not last very long."
"Highly recommended. One very good DIPA."
"I like this as much as DH 90 minute IPA, if not more... a great Bell's beer."
"The appearance of this brew was a foggy dark orange color with great head and decent lacing. Smell was a fruity bouquet of flowers. The most hoppiest smelling beer i've had. This was a mouthwatering, cheek puckering experience in a bottle. Nothing packs more hops than this thing. A little bitter, but in a terrific sort of way. Creamy kind of feeling. Probably one of the best beers ive ever had."
"If this beer could be less boozy and warm it might be a lot better."
"Flavors and alcohol nicely rounded together. Almost 10% ABV, 100+ IBU, can't beat that! :)"
"Sunset orange with a small white head of foam that dies gradually and is reinstated by a quick swirl of my tulip glass. This sample was served to me at the Spinnerstown Hotel in Spinnerstown (outside of Quakertown, PA) right by the haunted graveyard. This brew is very hoppy with a small malt backbone of caramel and spice in the background. The various American hops really shine through in the aroma of this beer and the taste holds true as well. A spicy, snappy, hoppy treat of a beer with a sweeter hop note up front and a bitter, resiny bite in the back. This one is kinda the balls. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well served to repeated drinking which lends a great drinkability to this hoppy yet extremely refreshing and smooth brew..."
"I am guessing this bottle was close to a year old since it is released at the beginning of every year, and the beer might taste completely different when it is more fresh, not by favorite beers from Bell's but still glad I tried since it is the top one hundred beers, recommended if curious but there are much better IPAs out there right now"
"Cheers!!!!"
"Exrememly drinkable. The 10% is present and it's a wonderful beverage to sit back, sip, and enjoy its all around presentation. Tastes much better then the aged one I ran across a month ago. Glad I picked up a case."
"Thanks to SkinnyElvis for the bottle."
"d: I like this beer. I am an IPA fan and this beer delivers the hops, but like most double IPAs, I wouldn't want to drink too many in one sitting."
"Delicious! That is really all I need to say about this beer. This was the beer that got me hooked on imperial IPAs. You can smell the hops as you pour. Pours amber/orane in color with a whitish head. Some alcohol flavor is present. Not overly bitter. Very smooth on the palate. Just amazing."
"D: If I could get this around here regularly, it would likely have a regular spot in my fridge. This is a damn tasty brew, and one I'm glad I got to try."
"This one pours a cloudy orange color with a medium head and has decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of grapefruit and grapefruit - actually, that's about all I get from this one. The flavor has enough malt to let you know that it's there, but it's almost all citrus and grapefruit hop flavors. Very hoppy. The body is medium/thick and the drinkability is ok."
"No gimmicks, no surprises, just one hell of a hop-slam across your palate."
"Drinkability- Despite the strong ABV, this beer is deciptively drinkable. On tap it is amazing as well as in the bottle. It looks to be bottle conditioned, but I don't know just how well it will hold up with further aging. I will hold on to a couple bottles, but I have a feeling it's at it's best before those hops mellow out on it."
"D - Another tasty offering from Bell's. The abv is well hidden."
"D- For a 9 percent abv this is definitely drinkable. I could sip on this all night. I don't know if I got an old bottle back in 2007 or what ... this is definitely a solid """A"" rating all around."
"Major disappointment to me."
"A huge hop-bomb. If that's what you're looking for, it will deliver."
"Medium-big mouthfeel with some carbonation bite. Nice DIPA but I think that prefer Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Still good and worth trying."
"Pours a golden orange with almost 2 fingers of creamy head that dies down to a layer sitting on top and huge lacing throughout. Smells of gynormous hops, pine, citrus and grapefruit. Tastes delicious. Huge hops, citrus, rind, grapefruit, pine and HOPS. Nice malty balance that lets this not be too over the top. I might not be getting the full hopslam effect since this is not a freshly bottled sample but this is up there and a delicious brew. Alcohol hides nicely and carbonation is perfect. No bitterness lingering. A classic."
"Saved some 2007 Hopslam and consumed in Spring of 2008. This beer ages extremely well! The edge of the fresh bottles is now much more mellow on the start, and the alcohol flavor is more subdued as well. It seems that even more of the hop flavor comes out in it now. I've still got a few bottles left, I plan on keeping at least one 2007 for another year. I'm planning on aging a few of the 2008 that I have as well."
"Not necessarily the world-endingly-awesome brew some were hoping for, but close to divine regardless."
"While I'm not blown away by HopSlam (I had it before but it was a few months old), but this fresh one is mighty tasty and one fine balanced DIPA. Drinkability (4)."
"Drinks too damn easy, a great balanced DIPA!"
"Overall impression: As the label says, """A biting, bitter, tongue bruise of an ale.""" Very nice though if you like the bitter hop flavors."
"Drinkability: I think this beer would be a perfect hop head session beer. Its flavorful yet not overpoweringly bitter. The alcohol would limit the amount I would drink. If I could get it year round, I would definitely drink this pretty often."
"Overall, very good. Still not sure if it is a slam, but it will certainly get your attention. I'm guessing my last review was on an older bottle."
"Oh my this is one amazing beer. This might be the best DIPA I have ever tasted. If not the best it is number 1-A. I could drink this by the gallon. I would bathe in HopSlam. My idea of heaven is a hamburger buffet with loads of gourmet cheeses and other toppings and an endless supply of HopSlam. Simply stated: I am so impressed. Is it love? Oddly, I thought I reviewed HopSlam. Hell, I also thought I had notes on this beer. They seemed to be misplaced. Luckily I have two bottles left (I wont after tonight!). Sadly, I cant thank the BA who traded me these beers because I cant remember. Thank you nevertheless!"
"A HopSlam indeed - whacks you 'upside the head with a huge dose of fresh, raw hops flavor. Bittering and bordering on a thick mouthfeel, but sufficiently reserved not to be too heavy. Hops stays forefront throughout, but manages not to completely overpower the senses. A well executed big hops beer."
"I think that that this beer definitely is hoppy enough for me, perhaps a bit too much for my liking. I will definitely try it again if it comes my way, but I dont think that I would be able to handle more than a couple in one session."
"Recieved this from brandoman63 in the brews-n-tunes summer '07 tour. Served slightly chilled in a snifter, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful golden amber color, that was a bit cloudy. About a quarter inch of loose, bubbly white head formed in the glass. Head almost instantly faded into a ring of bright white lace in the glass. Smell: Smooth , somewhat aggressive herbal hop aroma, tons of biscuity malt aroma, pears, citrus fruits, and pine all rose from the glass. Taste: Bitter hops that slam the tongue, bready and malty , subtle pineapple and pear. Also some very well hidden alcohol. A pretty well balanced brew. Nice full bodied, somewhat thick but smooth mouthfeel. Mildly carbonated. A very drinkable beer. Very enjoyable."
"Rerate: Oh how young I was when I wrote this! Upon a second tasting, it's obvious that this beer, while good, is too sweet and lacks the bitterness of a top-tier double IPA. Gotta dock points for that."
"Cheers2Beers"
"I love this beer. I'd drink lots if I could. Normally I would rate drinkability down a bit for higher alcohol percentage....but, personal opinion: I'd rather drink a few strong ones than a bunch of weak ones, so I'm gonna go with my gut and give it a good rating all around. Thank you Bell's."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and on the heavier side. This makes itself known as you drink it for sure. Good carbonation. This is just a freakin awesome double IPA and I cannot wait until they release this again. I've had this on tap as well and it's been phenomenal. Another feather in the hat for Bell's...easily one of my favorite midwest brewers. I'm patiently awaiting the day they distribute in IL again!"
"Drinkability - Another great IIPA; this one being one of the hoppiest flavored. The 9.3% ABV provides a warmth to the mix. Recommended."
"This is a wonderful beer. I'm not as familiar with the double IPA style as I would like to be as most of the double IPAs I've tried have really turned me off, either incredibly bitter or sweet and a balance between the two extremes just isn't there. This is definitely not the case with this example. It's very enjoyable. Of course, would I expect less from one of my favorite breweries?"
"This beer pours a hazy golden color like most IPA's. There is not a huge amount of bubbles that come up, but a generous amount. The smell of this beer is really terrific, lots of floral hops and special arrangements that I have never smelt before. The taste has five or six distinct hop tastes to it, but unfortunately never really develops any of them. You can tell that great time and energy went into this beer, but it seems like less time went into studying how the hops would react to each other, and whether or not they would all form together. I would still say this beer kicks ass, but the taste gets knocked as they forget that more is not always better. I'll definitely enjoy this again though."
"Overall a superior DIPA. Very drinkable considering the ABV. Thanks to czoch75."
"That said, I'd love to try this on tap or cask and see how it compares."
"No real depth of flavour. Unremarkable."
"D: Due to the well-managed hop presence, this one can easily be enjoyed in succession, I think.. especially for any hop-heads out there. Also, the refreshing aspect keeps you wanting more, as it won't blow you out of the frame with bitterness, despite its 106 IBU rating."
"I received this in a trade. Unfortunately I forgot who it was. But I would like to say a big THANK YOU to them and """Send me some more!!!""""
"Pours a burnt oragne hue with a fluffy white head that dies down a bit after pour. Stickiness is here and there, not a whole lot but it's present. Dirty, oily, citrus hops beat the crap outta my nose...but I love it. I also detect a stale bread scent in there as well, maybe this comes from the tiny bit of malt in this brew. Taste is not what I expected at all. Yeah the hops are there, but it's not that bitter at all. The malt displays itself quite well in the taste, very bready. A pale tasting malt, but perfect for this style. Hops seem to switch to a pine taste, but very pleasant. This is one complex tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy with little carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the alcohol is quite hidden. Wow, love this one. Definitely do what you can to get this beer. Bell's amazes again."
"Finally picked up this case after coveting it for about 6 months. Got home and poured one after a short cool in the fridge. A bit more bitter than i had expected, but this beer is exceptional. Great beer for fans of Pliny, Dreadnaught, 90/120 min IPA. Great beer!"
"This is quite a beverage. Thick syrupy. good. It is unique in its ultra sweetness and bitterness at the same time. Highly recommended."
"This brew is a hazy orange/amber color with a medium thick cream-colored head that dissipates slowly. Thick coating of lace on the entire glass. Huge grapefruity hops in the nose, along with a touch of sweet malt. Medium-bodied with a rich hoppy character that is full of zesty citrus and some pine. The alcolhol is well-hidden but you can tell it is there. Some sweet malt and fruit flavors are underneath as well. The finish is nicely bitter and lasting, retaining the citrusy hops feel. Not one of the """punch you in the face""" IIPAs but very good in its own right."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a nice 2 finger creamy head, leaves lots of thick lace on the glass. The smell is massive amounts of citrus hops with some pine aromas. The taste is all hops, it does not have an overt malt prescense. Of course there must be a ton of malts to balance out all these hops. The hops add lots of bitterness (like you would expect) but, there is an amazing amount of """aroma""" hops in the taste. The mouthfeel is just right, not to light, not to thick, great balance. This is one of my favorite IPAs. As a hop head, I think this is perfectly balanced between the malt backbone and the hops. Of course, if you are not a fan of overtop IPAs, then this probably is not for you :)"
"Don't let the name worry you. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer, likely to be enjoyed by both hopheads and beer drinkers even a little afraid to try hoppy beers. Thanks to Mr. Bell for bringing another great AIPA into an already crowded market. I think this one has staying power."
"The drinkability was great, quite enjoyable from the tap. Prosit, MK"
"Pours a clear copper color with nice big head that takes a few moments to dissipate. Big grapefruit aromas when you pop the cap with some pine notes lurking. Taste is relatively smooth citrus and pine hops with plenty of malts to give a sweet body. As it gets older the hops die off more quickly than I would have thought and it becomes a boozy sweet beer that does not reflect the fresh beer much at all. Mouthfeel is nice. A little too much alcohol to get a high drinkability score. A great DIPA, up there with my favorites. Fresh on draft must be excellent!"
"I'll leave my excellent graded review, but hopefully this will serve as a warning to me in the future."
"Bottled from batch 7806 and received in trade. I was very excited to receive this beer after reading so many glowing reviews. It has not disappointed. The aroma is big and the flavor is bigger. Huge citrus hop, lemon/orange and some pineapple and honeydew flavors. Great long lasting full flavor and it burps great too! Man, if Bells had California distribution, it would certainly be in a regular rotation for me."
"Drinkability - The beer is dangerously drinkable for 9.5%. Better watch out with this one cause it will creep up on you if you are not careful. One of the best Imperial IPA's out there in my opinion."
"D: Insanely drinkable for the ABV. This stuff is awesome. Definitely will have to get my hands on this again."
"D- It is very good. Huge amount of hops so for any hop head this would be a great beer."
"Flavor is perfectly balanced. Hops are fruity and citrus. Like biting into a ripe orange. The first sip grabbed my attention. Malts never rise to the top but are consistently present throughout each sip providing a perfect balance. Hop oils linger around the edges of the tongue. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but concealed well behind all the hops. A nice beer to enjoy a bottle or two at a time because after a couple my tongue would get numb."
"Yet another great beer from Bells Brewing. This is an excellent DIPA which is strong with hop flavor yet well balanced."
"12 ounce bottle poured in to a snifter. Texas orange with a short lived creamy color head. Very clear. Orange pith, wet grass, simple syrup, honey, maybe maple are in the nose. Lots of tongue coatig grapefruit and tropical hop flavor the finishes with a pleasant bitterness. Flavor lasted from front to back for several seconds. It keeps going and going. Thin and light on the palate, a sixer of this could go down in no time. My new favorite Bells? It certainly doesnt beat out Expo, even though its more drinkable. Your night my last longer with Two Hearted. I think Hopslam beats it out though."
"Bottle courtesy of IMtheOptimator: Poured a slightly hazy yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops is well balance with sweet caramel malt  the smell of this beer is really great and I can only compare with 3F dreadnaught in term of greatness. Taste is such a well balance mix between sweet caramel malt, bitter and citrusy hops and a great floral aspect to hold it all together. This is definitely something I will want and drink some more."
"The final touch of fresh cut grass and sweet malts makes this a hop lovers dream. This is the highest score I haved logged in to date!"
"If you're a hophead this is a be a beer you should try!"
"drinkability - definitely a sipper. goes down great, very enjoyable, but i don't think i would want two in a row."
"update: have had this many, many, times since, and i don't know if my palate has changed, but the last few years it seems the nose seems less fresh, zesty, and piney and more like overripe tropical and stone fruits predominantly."
"12 ounce bottle, batch 7741, packaged on 11/28/06. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with about a half inch white head which goes away pretty quickly. With a name like HopSlam, of course it smells like hops. Citrus (grapefruit) and piney hops dominate, with some malt in there. It tastes pretty much the same, but the citrus taste is stronger, with grapefruit, lemon and some orange in the taste, along with a piney/floral taste and some grain/malt. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with it being creamy and oily. Just the right amount of carbonation, too. The relatively high ABV isn't very noticable, and it's very, very drinkable. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer. I'd definitely buy this again."
"12oz bottle (I am assuming this a 2006 release) poured into a pint glass. It is copper in color with a small white head that recedes fairly quickly into a light covering. Also there is quite a bit of yeast from the bottom of the bottle that got stired up in the pour. The smell is very nice for a DIPA, hops and more hops. It is good mix of pine and grapefruit that yields a sweet bready malt smell through it all. The first sip is not as hoppy as the smell but very well balanced. It has an initial kick of pine but quickly turns to the malt and alcohol and finishes with a very nice bitter. It also has a slight medicinal flavor to it, but not overly strong. This is a good double ipa and doesn't get too sweet like some do in this style. The alcohol is just a tad warm for me, but not enough to say it is distracting. The mouthfeel is medium to thick and coats the mouth nicely. The overall drinkability is good for 9.3 abv beer. This is an excellent example of the style, not the best, but in the mid to top of the pack."
"Sampled a few different batches thusfar. Lovely hints of grapefruit and lemon on the palate. My only complaint is its a bit medicinal and herbal and I just dont like Double IPAs with that character. But, it has a lovely malt character. Wish it was a tad bit brighter, but its a lovely DIPA. Its no dreadnaught, but its a dawn good brew."
"Bottle into snifter. A: Bright hazy gold, creamy head that stuck around. S: Hoppy of course, very rich, lots of orange juice, raspberry, grapefruit, pine. T: Amazing. I've rediscovered the majesty of hops. More citrus and tropical fruit giving way to a balanced maltiness. Really incredible. M: Smooth, light carbonation. D: An absolute gem all around. For such a whopping ABV it's amazingly easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is a touch on the full side, and the drinkability on this is just great. I could drink a few of these without feeling completely pummeled by the hops, but I think the alcohol would definitely knock me out."
"Pretty easy and enjoyable to drink this one. More than one might be a challenge, but if this is the first beer of the night theres not much point moving on to something else. A good, maybe even ideal session brew for the IIPA loving hopheads. Not for those who dont like hops, this one definitely packs a hop slam! Glad i found this one, have been looking for it for a while. Will definitely drink again!"
"The quality of Bell's is delivered again. Perhaps Bell's best beer,! This is an excellent double IPA. If you love hops, you'll love this stuff. A great citrus aroma. The new batch is at 10% Alc and is very drinkable. This is easily one of my top 5 favorite beers."
"Full mouthfeel and great drinkability for 9.5abv. Draft is your best bet if you ask me!"
"I don't favor the overly drying bitterness without much balance from citrus or pine. And certainly this is no session beer - one is likely to do it for you no matter how much you like it. But if you want to explore this aspect of Centennial hops, there's probably no better-made beer to do it with."
" Good, but not as good as it could have been."
"I could drink these all day. And with the non-evident 9.3% ABV, the hangover the next morning would only serve as a constant, friendly reminder of how thoroughly happy I had been the day before."
"D- This beer is so flavorful I wouldn't mind having a lot of it, but I wouldn't say it's the most sessionable beer. I'm not sold on the drinkability but perhaps I'm just being harsh."
"In my opinion, a GREAT ale."
"This is one of my favorites for sure."
"Incredibly aromatic! Could smell it while being poured from the bottle into my mug. Poured with a nice head and some lace that lasted throughout the mug. Slightly hazy amber. Predominant grapefruit with a bit of pine in the nose and flavor. Body is decent. Looong hoppy finish that later turns a bit sweet or turns on the saliva glands. Very good beer! Little much in the grapefruit department for me. Still...."
"On draft at Vintage Estate in Youngstown, OH. Appearance is a golden orange amber color with minimal head. Citrus hopped IPA at its finest, you can really smell the serious amount of hop goodness. Taste is amazing very well balanced nice bitter flavor with that ipa finish. Highely recommend beer and would have again and again, if possible."
"Batch 7690 bottled on 10/25/06. Poured into a tulip. This beer is very cloudy and golden in color. The head is about 1 finger and dissipates quickly leaving some heavy lacing and stickiness all over the sides of the glass. Smell is floral at first - there is also some pine and a little bit of an almost pineapple like sweet smell, very interesting. This is an excellent tasting beer, even better than it's brother Two-Hearted, IMO. There's some grapefruit flavor up front which gives way to pineapple sweetness and it all ends with a bitter, dry hop kick. This is by no means the hoppiest beer ever, but it is incredibly well balanced for a double IPA. Mouthfeel is syrupy and delicious - the carbonation amount is just right. An incredible beer from my home state - this is an easy beer to drink, which might be dangerous since this baby clocks in at around 10%. Highest recommendation."
"I would have liked more hops but we cant have what we want everytime.While this beer isnt as hoppy as some of the double ipa monsters.It is tasty and worth checking out.I plan on having it again.Good job Bells!"
"The taste was pretty well balanced between the hops (again, not as omnipresent as you would expect from a beer called Hopslam) and the loads of malt they must use to make this. The finish is where, to me, this beer goes astray. Instead of leaving that really resiny, floral hoppiness to linger, the finish is dominated by a cloyingly sweet, candied malt flavor. This, coupled with the high ABV, makes for a """one and done""" kind of beer- not a sessionable brew at all."
"It feels fairly carbonated, sparkling on my tongue, but goes down easily. I could drink a hundred of these. Reinforces my love of Bell's beers and reminds me that I love drinking beer."
"As for drinkability, this brew will never be confused with Rolling Rock. But given its 9.3% ABV, a slight markdown in this category is almost an act of professional responsibility. :)"
"FOURTH TRIAL: This is a great beer for any hop-lover, although I have to admit that it's tasted a bit different each time I've had it. This time it was great, other times it's a bit too sweet for my taste. It pours a golden yellow with very little head (there is a good bit of lacing though). The aroma is slightly peachy with a lot of nice, clean hoppy citrus. The taste is similar, but there's a definite warming and you can taste the alcohol (not in a bad way). This beer is less malty that some of the recent DIPAs I've had, but the little malt flavor it does have is a nice caramel. The mouthfeel is full and smooth and it leaves a nice sticky bitterness on the back of the tongue. Overall, a great Double IPA."
"Drinkability: Hopslam is dangerously drinkable for a DIPA. A hopheads delight with big, juicy citrusy hops dominating the aroma and flavor profile but is still balanced with a good nice amount of malt. Alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor, though a nice warming of the face takes place after putting one of these back. If it wasn't for the 9%abv I could see making a session of these, instead I'll enjoy a couple and call it a night. A fantastic DIPA from the folks at Bell's. Highly recommended, especially if you like citrusy hops. Seek and Enjoy."
"The aroma is confectioner's sugar and even cotton candy, but mostly deep red juice...I'm at a carnival. This is sinfully good...sinful being the operative word. Evil...as I say in my profile, """If beer is wrong, I don't wanna be right.""""
"HopSlam is without a doubt a hop lover's delight. For an American Double IPA it's hard to find a lot of fault in this beer."
"I poured this into a DFH snifter. This beer pours very cloudy. I would have liked to see it cleaner. According to the BJCP, slight haziness is allowable if it is dry hopped, but this is a bit more than that. It doesn't seem to clear with time either. There is a huge hop bouquet even from a distance. Very strong citrus aromas, especially grapefruit, but slightly more bitter. The flavor is amazing though. It is not nearly as bitter as the flavor would have led me to believe. It is a dead ringer for actual grapefruit flavoring. The bitterness is only in the background, and there is enough sweetness to back it up. This is a great example of an Imperial IPA (except the cloudiness); perhaps one of the best i've had."
"Thankfully, the mouthfeel and drinkablity of this beer are just as good. Served at the right temperature, this is the perfect blend of smooth body and light carbonation. Drinks much easier than the DFH 90, and less bitter than BBC's Professor Gesser. Eager to try this one out of the bottle. Great beer."
"Even my girlfriend, who is usually a straight macro girl, liked this. This is the best DIPA by far, and one of the best beers I have ever tasted. Amazing in every respect."
"Drinkability: One of those terrific citrus hop bombs that leave you ready for another"
"It poured a dark amber with acres of fluffy white head. Aroma is extremely hoppy and citrus-y. However, flavor was a bit different. It was somewhat grassy and astringent. While the flavor has some citrus-ness to it, it was quite dry. Think citrusness without sweetness. Mouthfeel was slightly flat in its character."
"From the bottle into my Delirium Tremens tulip glass. Yessir, the HopSlam is another pretty beer. Amber-apricot color with a nice creamy-looking head which, surprisingly, doesn't last too long. Minimal lace on the glass. The aroma here is phenomenal. It's like a piney citrus explosion in my nose, and I can't get enough of it. Truly a delicious scent. Reminds me of the 120 Minute in a way. Large and in charge. More beers should smell like this. The taste is great too. Fresh and hoppy, with pine, grapefruit, and pepper flavors. Noticeable alcohol presence here as well. Quite tasty indeed. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Hoppy bitterness all down the back of the mouth and throat. Nicely done. I'm not surprised that it's over 9% ABV, but I wouldn't have guessed it. The alcohol is noticeable, as I said, but not overwhelming. This would pair nicely with a spicy Thai or Indian dish, and might even match up well with a strong blue cheese like Stilton. Another good beer from Bell's."
"Yeah, one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and the only one I would classify as sessionable. That works both for and against it."
"Overall, I love this beer. It's very quenching. Not so thick like some DIPA's. At $12.99 a sixer, unfortunately not an every day brew. But it backs up the addage; Drink better, Drink less."
"Poured carefully into a nonic, trying hard to avoid mixing in the copious amounts of sediment in the bottom of the bottle (almost as much as some Belgian ales!). The result is a golden-amber hued beer with minimal carbonation streams and a vibrant, sudsy head of just-this-side-of-white foam, sticky and thick. Juniper-infused citrus juice blend in the nose: grapefruit, satsuma, blood orange. A coy sugary sweet scent sneaks around underfoot. The taste of this IPA is B-I-G: big candied orange peel malts and big citric hop bitterness. Grapefruit pith and pinetar candy in the middle. Sweetroll breadiness at the finish. Substantial mouthfeel, slippery but not yet syrupy -- always a plus in my book -- with a slight pepperiness all around. Not bitter enough to be outstanding (I'm picky about this style), but this is without a doubt an extremely fine DIPA. Would buy again. Many thanks to zrrbrrt for the opportunity."
"I like this brew, I hope I can find it out here."
"Pours a wonderful clear light orange color (with the exception of the massive amount of floaties). Aroma is out of this world. Fresh pineapple and other tropical fruits. Good frothy white head and decent lacing. Taste matches the aroma- just an assault of fruits and hop flavour. No astringent bitterness whatsover. Just amazing- trust Bells to accomplish that. Along with the hops is a sweet malt back bone that gives a rich mouthfeel. I would say that this is a balanced DIIPA despite the hops. Exceptionally drinkable which would be very dangerous. I would love to try this on tap one day. Alcohol is absolutely hidden. Finish is a bit spritzy from the caronation but finishes clean somewhat bitter. Best IIPA Ive had the opportunity to sample."
"Pours an orange, golden color with some little floaters and a huge white head. The smell is what really draws you in to this one. Big and bold! Citrus and pine needles slap you in the face. Taste is just as big of a wake up call. Hops, hops, and more hops, of course! It's like someone took an orange and soaked it in pine-sol and threw it in my face. I mean that in a good way. Bombs the palate, but that's why I'm only drinking DIPA's tonight!"
"Murky, yellowish sort of color. Good sized head. Healthy dose of yeast poured out of bottle. Big hop nose-extremely fresh-like newly mown grass. Fantastic hop flavor-like sucking on a cone itself. Great lingering grapefruit like flavors. Underlying sweet maltiness. Has one of the freshest hop flavors I have ever had-similar to Moylan's Hopsickle. Great body-very full yet extremely quaffable. Exceptionally drinkable and dangerously so. I just want to gulp down the hoppy goodness in this beer. Definately kicks butt!!!! Thanks to trep for this """extra""" trade sample."
"medium mouthfeel, surprisingly light for the alcohol content, with a medium carbonation. unexpectedly drinkable, with a strong hoppiness but a gentle, balancing, fruit and honey sweetness. aspirin component comes back in the finish. despite that, this is a very well put-together beer."
"HopSlam is Bell's hop concerto. As hop-centric as this ale is, it's still incredibly drinkable. This one might scar the average bud drinker, but for the hopheads, this just might be nirvana."
"A golden wheat orange hazy hue of a body hosts a fat bubbley off white head at about an inch and a half that fades fast and leaves nice lace. Nose is a monsterois hop explosion. Very floral and an invigorating eye opener with wiffs of fresh citrus and spicey pepper hints. Splashes the tongue with huge surprisingly sweet ripe citrus tones. Very hoppy but bitter is not harsh but silky and longingly enjoyable. This beer is its own hop masterpiece. Nice real hop, long and fresh mouthfeel. Oddly drinkable for such a mouth bruiser. Your tongue will never be the same."
"Highly recommended, one of the few beers that absolutely lives up to its massive hype."
"Excellent fruity flavors that dance across the tongue. This has a really awesome hop aroma and flavor. It almost reminds me of Maharaja. I'd buy a case if I could."
"Andrew (orfeu) your the man giving this beer to me I thought I was gonna have to wait until May when Iam back home to try to get my hands on this.Poures a hazed peachy color with a tight well formed sticky white head,holy cow fresh hop aromas citrus fruit with underlying pine it really wakes up the sences thats for sure just amazing.Oh man just hop goodness here resiny but bright and flavorful citric fruitiness combined with pine/resin dryness just great hop balance....malt nowhere to be found but thats fine with me.Liquid gold here for a hophead its bright and flavorful with awesome hop complexity,again thanks alot Andrew this kicks serious arss."
"Draft at KClingers. Bright orange-yellow with a thin layer of white foam. Holy crap ... this is one of the biggest hop-fruit aromas Ive ever experienced, almost orange-blossomy. Follows with the same flavors, big and oily, tart and tangy, like an orange soda on steroids. (#2649, 1/14/07)"
"Comments: I wish I had a case of this! Too bad Bell's doesn't distribute in MA. Truly well balanced DIPA. Loved every sip."
"HopSlam is true to its name, and is among my top three favorites in the American Double IPA style. Batch 7787 / 6330 (Julian date)"
"Drinkability: Awesome for a double IPA."
"Body is perfectly medium with a soft mouthfeel like smooth flower petals with a creamy texture and lasting finish of complex hops. Insanely drinkable due to it's severe deliciousness and well hidden alcohol content. I hope the bottled version is as good when (if) it ever makes it to Charlotte."
"Not the absolute best Double IPA out there, but its certainly up there. One thing that does stand out about this beer however is how well balanced everything; there is firm malty backbone to stand up against the intense hop profile, the sweetness of the malt itself isnt to sugary and the body is just thick enough to give the beer an extra rich character but not so thick that it diminishes the drinkability. Overall, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very good. Not the most impressive DIPA I've had, but a damn good one. I love the stillness and suspension of the floating particles. This is certainly worth enjoying whenever available, especially for hop heads. I'd say it's also worth buying a case per year upon release to take full advantage of the freshness."
"Drinkability: Wonderful. I love the fact that this beer is like two in one. Without resuspending the yeast, it is a light bodied, heavily hopped intense IPA. With resuspending the yeast, it is a fuller, mellower and more complex IPA."
"Wow...based on this bottle, I'd be willing to vote this one as the most over-rated beer that I've had in '07. Last year, my vote went to Stone Oaked Bastard. This certainly isn't a terrible beer, it's just very overly hyped IMO and I'm not feeling the love. It sort of reminds me of a recent homebrew that I did, where I used a boat load of 6-7 different hops and hoped for the best. It turned out alright but a bit muddled, much like this with every aspect of hops being represented from herbal, to skunky, to citrus, etc. I just don't get it. Maybe the next bottle will change my mind. I've only got 5 more to compare it with."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and hugely deceptive of its 9.3% ABV. I would certainly love to have a couple at a sitting. Over the years this has definitely stood out as one of my all-time favorite beers."
"While my initial reaction to appearance and smell was somewhat disturbing, this beer's flavor more than makes up for these other shortfalls. This is an excellent beer that I will purchase again without a second thought."
"Hopslam is a culprit of many of the pitfalls that I warn against when it comes to hoppy American ales- its balance should not render the IPA-forward flavors in this positive of a manner. But its intangibles in taste and textures far exceed what's expected for the style and its overall flavor profile cannot be ignored."
"Bottom line: Absolutely delicious. Thanks to Wasatch for allowing me to try this wonderful brew!"
"Highly drinkable for the hopheads of the world. Very strongly hopped but very tasty. In the same class as Pliny The Younger and Dreadnaught."
"Overall, this beer is the benchmark against which I will compare all other DIPAs in the future. A tremendous balance of sweet and bitter, it is a beer every BA should try."
"Overall, this was one of the most pleasant tasting, well-balanced and easy-drinking DIPA's I have sampled."
"Drinkability is quite good, expecially for the style."
"Finishes with lingering fruit, some mild warmth and a lingering dry, crisp snap."
"Hazy golden/copper color and a spotty off white cap that actually has some stick to it. The nose is fruity, spicy hops, citric, grapefruit and a strong alcohol tinge. Tastes of bitter, dry, spicy hops, pithy fruit characters, and an impenetrable alcohol burn. Barley malt balance, piney, and some resiny turpentine notes. Full body and medium mouthfeel has some chew to it followed by some cloying. The finish is good with fruity, peppery character but much of the alcohol carried over is a little overwhelming. Flavor is good but the alcohol burn makes this a hard one to drink more than one."
"Poured into a standard pub pint. A one finger vanilla cream head with bits of hop suspended in it. Fine carbonation, not a lot but its there. Very piney with a bunch of citrus. Slick citrus hops coat the tongue with a bite in the middle to back. Moderately sweet body with a long hop finish. Worth trying but not top of the heap."
"D- Very drinkable, Very balanced, but I couldn't have more than a few without burning my pallette off. The $12 a six pack price also would deter me from drinking this except for special occasions"
"A light amber color with strong visibility of carbonation. It has a quater inch white head, that has very good retention. What an incredible aroma, strong hop scents, with citrus, pine, and earthy fragrances attack the nose. Malt starts the flavor off well, then it blends into this intense hop flavor. The hops start slowly with a light citrus flavor, it then it gradually becomes more pronounced as it reaches every taste bud on the palate. A light feel on the tip of the tongue, but it gains heftiness as it flows towrds the back of the throat. Quite frankly, this is an amazing beer, incredible aroma, intense flavor (106 IBU's !), make this a must try beer for any hophead out there."
"If I crave hops, this is my beer...and what a beer it is!"
"(batch # 7775)"
"One of the best beers I've tried even being on the expensive side, $14.99 for a 6 pack. Very, very hoppy with a strong grapefruit aftertaste that lingers for a little while. Nice carbonation and the alcohol does not jump out at you but at 9.30% you'll probably notice it more the first time you stand up. While there are a few other DIPA's out there for less $$, this is a hard-to-find item where some stores are only getting in a couple of cases for the whole season."
"Took the bottle from the fridge and poured it right into my glass. Cloudy yellow/light amber color with a whitish/yellow head. Good head retention. Strong citrusy smell - mostly like oranges, and this came through in the flavor a little as well. Almost tasted a little of orange rind with the hop bitterness on the end. Pretty well balanced bitterness and maltiness produced an above average flavor. Medium/full body with medium/light carbonation. Very drinkable beer for me. Only the 2nd DIPA I've tasted, and I liked this one much better than the first."
"Drinkability: This is a great double IPA. I feel that the hops flavor is great and really displays a nice citrus floralness of the hops with out huge bitterness. Even my finance could tolerate it!"
"A very well-crafted dipa that really introduced me to the big boys of the style."
"This beer is pretty drinkable - even with the strong bitterness. It might be hard to drink more than two though."
"Overall Impression - This is a well crafted imperial IPA. The malty backbone is appropriately overshadowed by intense citrusy hop character. This is crisp, well attenuated and refreshing. Nicely done!"
"Received this fine brew from zrrbrrt, another followed from sman262. Thanks to both of you!"
"This is another great beer from Bells. This is worth seeking out. Especially at it's price point, it's an easy choice."
"Cloudy golden color with white head and modest amount of carbonation. Smell is a burst (or slam) of hops and as expected the taste follows suit. Lots of pine is noticable at first. Very resinous mouthfeel, almost sticky. Finished with grapefruit bitterness and some burn from the ABV hops combination. Not what i would call highly drinkable but certainly fits the bill for a DIPA."
"Another solid beer from Bell's. This reminds me of a more grapefuity version of Ruination. Personally, for a DIPA, I'd like to have a little more crystal malt flavor/body, but this is just fine the way it is. I'll be buying this again, assuming that I can still find it around town. Highly recommended."
"Two thoughts:Nectar of the Gods and Grapefruit Juice from heaven. That is what this beer is like. I love the total package. Very artfully crafted. The hops are HUGE! But, they're hidden behind a masterfully built malt base. Lots of citrus, pine and honey flavors going on here. What a great combination. A hopheads dream? I think so! The finest beer that I've tasted so far to date."
"Drinkability is good. The explosion of hop flavors is enjoyable and easy enough to drink quickly but I still think one of these per session would be enough. I just wish I could've found this closer to its release."
"This beer surprised me a lot. I expected a thick, malty, over-the-top beer like I'm used to with double IPA's. But instead I got a balanced, flavorful, and easy drinking beer that I'll be seeking out again. Thankfully I have all 12 ounces to enjoy tonight."
"The dryness surprised me, expected more oils in the texture. The old age Beamster cheese from Amsterdam paired like a champ with this one."
"D- Amazing. 9+%? This beer has ruined me for other DIPA's. Nothing else stands up anymore."
"This brew lived up to all the hype for me, and more. I didn't expect it to be as drinkable as it was, and while hops are the main character, this definitely isn't a one trick pony. While this isn't quite on the level of Dreadnaught, it certainly is one of the top DIPAs I have tried."
"An exception DIPA - malt, tons of hops, and the alcohol never intrudes...until maybe later. Highly recommended. No regrets buying this by the case."
"D - An amazing beer. I've never had a beer with such a strong hop preence matched by a strong sweet presence until now."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky copper color with a huge three-finger off-white bubbly head. Sticky, foamy lacing is left on the glass. Smell is amazing... I can smell it from two feet away. Definitely all hops, mostly citrus (grapefruit) and slightly of pine. The taste is similar to the nose, obviously mostly hops. I have to disagree with those who say the alcohol isn't noticeable. Don't get me wrong, it is a great tasting beer for 9.3%, but it is noticeable. The mouthfeel is actually quite a bit lighter than I had anticipated and has a creamy consistency. This is a wonderful beer by Bell's and aside from the fact that it does have a substantial ABV, it is a very drinkable beer."
"What a great beer. Very easy to enjoy. The alcohol is hardly noticed in this one, so be careful."
"D: This beers only drawback is that the impression of too much residual sugar dings this beer in its drinkablity."
"Very smooth and easy to drink for a DIPA. The abv , although it's over 9%, isn't noticeable and that's impressive. Larry did one hell of a job on this one. Now, can we get him to make this one a bit more frequently?"
"HopSlam is a grand slam of a DIPA. It may not be the biggest, the hoppiest, or the most bitter version that I've ever let flood my taste buds, but it's one of the most drinkable. Anyone who considers hops to be the soul of beer, as I do, owes it to himself to seek this one out. I am in awe."
"RERATE: OK, so I managed to score another bottle-- thanks, Capone's. Unremarkable head? What the ass was I thinking?! This beer is gorgeous, great big soap bubbles and killer lacing on top of a glorious cloudy orange. By far the best DIPA I've tasted to date."
"Although this is an enjoyable beer, I'm not sure it's worth the premium price. I could just as easily enjoy Lake Louie's Kiss the Lips for less money, or pay even more to enjoy the ultimate IPA in Goose Island's Imperial IPA. Your mileage may vary, however, since I usually don't seek out over-hopped beers. This is a great beer, and I wouldn't turn one down."
"This may be the bet beer I've reviewed yet. just fantastic. Right in my wheelhouse. Bell's can brew, baby."
"Drinkability is good hell great wishing I could have bought a couple of sixers in Asheville, come on Larry whats the use of Dist. to NC if you don't ship the good shit. Thanks go to merlin48 for yet another great treat thanks again Sam."
"I had this big sucker in bottle at UJ's on the Manatawny a few weeks back. The beer poured a yellowish color, a bit cloudy with a thick white head. The beer has a big citrus, hoppy aroma that is very pleasing to the nose. There is a nice earthy, hoppy bite to the taste that really takes hold of your tongue but there is also a nice balance of sweetness in this that makes the overall mouthful very enjoyable and smooth. nice carbonation and body."
"Overall: Thanks go out to ggaughan for hooking me up with this winner. I really enjoyed every drop of this beer. I wish I had access to this and other Bell's beers."
"Pours a hazed deep orange color with a thick white head and sheets of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a wonderful boquet of hops. There is a little pine in there, some citrusy grapefruit, tangerine, and lime, along with some fresh peaches, and a faint toffee smell in there. Taste is more of the same as the aroma. Mouthfeel is a little more thin than you would expect from an IIPA but still good. Drinkability is great, no sign of the alcohol and this definitely goes down easy. Definitely a great beer and I will pick up more of this."
"Pours a hazed golden, thin white head forms, settles to a ring around the glass, nice lacing. Smell is massive pine, tons of citrus, floral, every hop smell imaginable, they must use a boatload, grapefruit acidity, no malt in my nose, excellent. Taste is a grapefruit truck, almost puckering with hops, lots of citrus and pine, again almost no malt, slight graininess, not a lot of depth the the hops certainly slam you good. Balanced in the sense the IBU's match the malt, not overdone in that sense but hopped to hell and back. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol warmth. Not bad at all, thanks Scott!"
"The color is a nice amber. Even with a careful pour there are floaties by the hundreds. Also no head, but probably because of my timid pour. The smell of hops is amazing. The floral and grapefruity aromas are delicious. The taste is also delicious. Aromatic citrusy hops give way to drying bitter hops. And your taste buds are officially fried. The only thing to do is have another. But be careful, as I learned the first time I bought this. It is way too easy to drink considering the alcohol level."
"D - High ABV limits drinking this all night, but two at a time seems just about perfect."
"Overall: An amazing beer from an amazing brewery. Right up there with some of the best West Coast DIPA's. Highly recommended."
"D- I could make this my everyday beer, but I might be limited to 2. Really this is an amazing beer which I wish was available in my area."
"T: Juicy hop heaven. There is alot going on in this brew but it tasty none the less. Even though the hops dominate this beer it is balanced enough to enjoy. A savory treat!"
"Although DIPAs are not my session beer, this is an DIPA that deserves extended sampling. If you are a fan of the style, this beer is a must try. If you are not a fan of DIPAs but want to increase your ability to judge other styles of beers this is a DIPA to start with. No doubt about the hops in this beer. Had it on tap at the cafe, will have to compare later to the bottle version."
"Most expensive sixer I have ever purchased, but a bargain compared to $3.50-$5 for a pint of semi-decent beer at a bar."
"I see this compared to things such as the Dreadnaught, GI IIPA, and Ruination and I really find it to be considerably different from those fine offerings. It's more oily and certainly packing more hop flavor vs. a malt sweetness. I tell you what though, Bell's knows how to brew an American IPA."
"Lacks body in my opinion, probably due to the lack of malting. Kinda thin overall. Okay drinkability. This one just doesn't do it for me, and I'm not quite sure why it is garnering the reviews it is getting."
"Excellent looking beer here, blonde color with a white head that has great retention and leaves plenty of lacing. Smell is very nice too, plenty of pine and fresh grapefruit to treat your nose. Taste was very hoppy, as expected. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, various other citrus flavors were also noticed. Bitterness was certainly present, but not a harsh bitterness, was more about hop flavor than IBU's. Medium body with a medium carbonation pair quite well with this one. Very solid beer, I would definitely have another, wish I picked up more than a single."
"D: Wow. Amazingly drinkable and smooth for the high abv that this brew toutsabv goes unnoticed and is masked completely by the huge hop flavors. Bitterness could be a bit more pronounced and the sourness in the aftertaste was a bit surprising."
"Pored a cloudy,hazy pale amber with a huge white head that did not fade. Smell was off the charts cirus hops, thought I was in an orange grove. Taste was well you can probably oimagin, fantastic. Deep citrus and Pine, but not overwhelming at all. Complex dry finsh. Not overly carbonated. This is very drinkable as the ABV is well hidden and I could probably end up drinking too many before I knew it. Oh how I cannot wait for all these Bell's to be in NC!!"
"Drinkability: It was so good, that I don't care (maybe a little for the sake of my cash flow) that it costs $15 for a six pack. You pay the money for a top notch quality brew. Instead IMO they should have called this fruit slam or fruit explosion. There was more fruit than hops in this beer. This is another beer that seems to disappear into thin air because it's so good. This is another (I know there are many) Bell's beer you should try at least once."
"Drink: Yes, would have again and could certainly have more than one."
"12oz. bottle poured a sun burst yellow/orange color with a large white head and spotty lacing also lots of particles floating around. Lots of tropical fruit in the aroma, some pineapple and other citrus hop scents. Taste like my tongue was slammed with bittering citrus hops with a bit of a dry finish. Good medium feel and easy to drink for a big hoppy beer."
"This is what a double IPA should be. It's very bitter, very flavorful, but also balanced with a massive malt payload that skirts the line between being overly sweet and too insubstantial to stand up to the hops. In other words, this beer is awesome."
"Love Bell's...really enjoy this beer."
"This beer pours out a nice white head that sticks around and has a small amount of lacing. The color is a nice orange and looks nice. The taste is mellow with some very nice hoppiness that's not too bitter. The mouthfeel is very smooth and nice to the palate. Overall it's great and I would like to have more."
"Upon pouring, it looked good until a hunk of sediment fell out of the bottle. I don't mind all the floaties, but that was a little gross. Otherwise, it was a light copper color with a little off-white head. Upon smelling - PINE! Wow, hops in abundance, and a little floral. Hard to detect anything beyond the hoppy smell. Good, but that's it. Of course, the flavor was similar, with very little sweetness. A little oily and yeasty, and the finish lingered all day. In the mouth it was very pleasant - surprisingly smooth, and gently carbonated. Overall, this was a good brew, and I didn't notice the alcohol until I got a little loopy later. The hops definitely quashed the alcohol presence. Pretty good..."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easy for a beer with 9.30% ABV, not too filling, its a little too intense to be a good pounder, I could still put a away few rather quickly and enjoy it quite a bit. I got exactly what I expected from this beer which was Two Hearted Ale with more hops and more alcohol. However, more doesnt necessarily mean better. Two Hearted Ale is one of the best beers Ive ever had and the extra hops and alcohol dont make this beer better than Two Hearted Ale, just more hardcore. This is an excellent beer overall though."
"Slainte!"
"The mouth is just great, smooth, creamy, vibrant, carbonation, just right, long finish, bitterly bitterlo, bitterla. Yes. But its f'in pricy, understandably, and right high in alcohol, but lovely to drink. All in all, f yes, Bell's. Not the best DIPA in my book, but page two or three or so ain't so shabby."
"This is a dope beer and a contender with the likes of Pliny the Younger and Pizza Port's Frank DIPA."
"D: For the alcohol content, I'd say it's reasonably drinkable. Still, no more than two for me..."
"drinkability is great. the hops are so juicy that i can't wait to have more. you'd never really know that it's over 9% unless someone told you. this is an interesting and great dipa."
"D - One or two a night, but it seems like a little bit of a mish mosh attempt. I WILL however be re-reviewing this. beer."
"Pours a murky gold with a finger of white head, slowly dissipating. Strong citrus and pine needles in the noise, with pine needles becoming more pronounced over time. Slam is right for the taste; multiple levels of hop bitterness, maltyness in a thick body. It lights up sweet and bitter at the outset, levelling off to a creamy sweetness, and leaving a bitter tang at the end. Alcohol comes out more in the flavor than the nose, but I'm sure it acts to enhance the flavors. Very good drinkability, but the alcohol leaves a trail on the way down, so I don't have a desire to drink it rapidly."
"Clear, deep gold, just short of orange. The foam off the pour was a mixture of fine, creamy bubbles and larger ones that clung to the glass. The head fell somewhat, leaving some lacing behind. Throughout the glass there was a constant renewal of lace. Intense hop aroma. Grapefruit and pineapple give it a sweet-tart quality and pine resin keeps things interesting. It's a little powdery, floral and smells very fresh. Strong bitterness is kept in check by significant malt sweetness. The malt isn't really complex, but that's not the point. The hops are the point - and there are plenty in here. Grapefruit, tangerine, and pine dominate from start to finish. Quite fruity, actually. Bitterness lingers and there's alcohol warmth from the mid through the finish. Medium/full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy texture. This stuff is great. Too many brewers forget about balance in this style, but Bell's has done a great job here. I could drink this all night (at least until the abv caught up with me)."
"If you're an IPA fan, this is the brew for you, just not your wallet. This beer is extremely drinkable and I give it my highest rating for an IPA yet"
"Bell's produces another winner. I might as well stop reviewing beers from these guys and just say there all freaking good. Cheers."
"D - I just now noticed the high ABV...wow! I honestly had no idea when I was drinking this. Anyway though...this ranks very firmly in my top 3 DIPA's and I want to have this on hand at all times. Compared to others, $45/case sounds great to me. Amazing, just amazing."
"Another very drinkable DIPA in what seams to be a string of good ones."
"Notes: This is a pricy beer, but a must try for any hop head."
"Although the taste didn't exactly do it for me, I was impressed by how drinkable the 9.3% was. The bitterness, or lack of, kind of let me down, but this was still a pretty good DIPA. Worth a try at the least."
"This beer, wow. The hops brings your taste buds alive. This high ibu beer does an excellent job of bringing a full body taste well rounded. To all that hops, and bells has done a great job with this hopslam. The aroma of the beer brings a strong fruity smell, but dont be scared this is not what you taste. Try the beer and let the hops take you away."
"Great job Bell's Brewery, I am impressed!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and even, highly drinkable for such a powerful brew. Thank you Brent for sharing yet another fantastic selection."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a dark golden color with a bright white head. Had some kind of floaties in it as well that never settled. Unbelievable smell of pineapple juice and possibly grapefruit but on the sweeter side. Initial taste of sweet pineapple taste switching to a bitterness that was less than expected. The sweetness then kinda works it's way back in. Perfect carbonation, medium-light mouthfeel. Awesome drinkability for something this potent. Possibly my favorite in this style and only wish I would have bought more when I had the chance."
"The taste is wonderful smooth yet bitey, the bittering hops really do good work, the malt is there yet not really sweet, but still they keep the hops on the just the right path, not too bitter or too over bearing. The alcohol makes it a dangerously tasty treat, you can only really have one or two. I love this stuff, for me it is another wonderful Double IPA, I'd love to add to my fridge's permanent collection."
"D: If only this were a part of Bell's normal line-up. I would definitely fit this beer in to my rotation. Amazingly drinkable for the immense flavor."
"Wow, this is a great double IPA. I'm so glad I had a chance to try this."
"Mouthfeel is stunning. Thick mouthfeel, but super creamy...like a properly done oatmeal stout. Amazing. I've never had an IPA with this kind of hop-oily mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation and some lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4""" eggshell head above the slightly cloudy golden brew. Frothy head fades slowly, with ample lacing. Aroma is dominated by pungeant fresh hopiness. Taste is malty sweet upfront, and segues nicely into the intensely fruity and piney hops character. Mouthfeel is incredible for a DIPA, so smooth, not allout bitterness just for bitterness' sake, and drinkability is great as well. Have to lookout on this one, with the substantial abv too. Glad I have some more of this one floating around."
"D: The 9.3% abv is tough and those hops will strip your taste buds but you'll love every second of it."
"Two thoughts here. #1 - Whoah! Like chewing on a hop!!!!, and #2 - Whoah! Like chewing on a hop! Absolutely bright, vivid and in-your-face! Grapefruit! Pineapple! Pine-needles! All Pac northwest! One of the best, if not THE best, big-assed citrusy hop beers. Drinkability suffers a little bit, sure, but that's the trade-off for such a massively beautiful rendition of dripping, citrusy and piney hops in a glass. Hop-hazy as expected in the glass; dropping head. Alcohol can be inhibiting to drinkability, but never really exhibits itself throughout the first serving. Beautiful!!!!, but perhaps only for the initiated. Regardless, worth trying for the experience."
"I wasn't wowed by this beer, but it was a fine selection that I would be glad to try again if I get the chance. Recommended..."
"Definitely pick this one up if you can."
"Very smooth to drink, despite the very high IBUs. Another outstanding brew from the good folks at Bell's."
"Once again, Larry and the Bell's crew put out an excellent beer. If it's not the best double IPA, then it's definitely in the top five. This should be the new benchmark for the style. Hopefully Bell's decide to make this a more regular offering. Pick this up if you see it...you will not be disappointed."
"Side Note- while drinking a pint of HopSlam, someone called to see if it was on tap then came in, filled a growler, and left."
"Cheers."
"Life is good."
"Tempurature is the key with this one. I've had this one served rather cold and it makes it a lot drier and more bitter. The one I reviewed poured at about 55 degrees right out of the fridge and only got better from there."
"Gimme a 6-er of this and I will be cozy,cumfy and dangerous."
"Drinkability is; if you like big hoppy beers, excellent !"
"Very drinkable, especially since I lean more toward maltier beers usually. I could easily have a few of these."
"D: I say this about almost all DIPA's, but....it lacks some of the depth I'm looking for. Yes, this is a delicious and tremendous beer. Is there anything wrong with simplicity? Absolutely not. But to hit the upper echelon of ratings IMO you need to have depth."
"Overloaded with hops to please those of us who can never get enough of alpha and beta acids!"
"Mouthfeel was slightly oily and full/medium bodied. Fantastic. Just as good on tap as it is from the bottle."
"As with most DIPAs, it would be nice to have access to this year round (and in Colorado). I'd say pick some up if you can and enjoy it while you can. Definitely worth a try as it throws a slight variation into the DIPA canon."
"The hop character here is so smooth & even soft (despite being amped up and loud overall); the brewer definitely took a heavy handed approach with smooth fruity hops like Simcoe and Amarillo when brewing this beer. The flavor does not have much, if anything, noticeable of the onion / garlic note that I experienced in the aroma, though perhaps there is a touch of it in the finish. Really the finish is dominated by a smooth, lingering bitterness that perhaps takes on a touch of mentholated pine. I really am a sucker for these smoothly fruity, over the top, one dimensional hop bombs. This is quite bitter, though I don't necessarily realize it most of the time. This is totally only comprises one dimension of the usual three that a beer can have (hop, malt and yeast), but it is so enjoyable in its expression of the hop."
"Hazy copper color with a bit of sediment. The beer is topped by a thick, fluffy off-white head. The nose is dominated by citrus hops. Nice blend of grapefruit and mandarin orange. Little malt in the aroma. The flavor? Citrus, citrus, and more citrus. I would not call it a hop bomb, as the bitterness is not overwhelming, but there is a load of mandarin and grapefruit citrus with just a touch of pine midway. The malt is a subtle sweetness that accentuates the hoppy character. The mouthfeel is light and slightly effervescent. Remarkably, and wonderfully drinakble. There was a nice thread between some friends of mine a while back as to how this compares with the Two Hearted Ale. Very different beer. I prefer Two Hearted. This is still a nice offering."
"I cannot say enough good things about this beer. It pours well, not much head, great color, a bit cloudy or thick looking. The aroma is amazing, fruity, hoppy, and very enticing. The taste blew me away. I was expecting a big beer, and got one...now I can't stop drinking it. It has a nice balance, not too bitter, but it will ruin your palate for anything else. I could drink this beer all day and am getting worried about what I will be drinking when it is gone....that will be a sad day."
"Looks more like a plain jane pale ale than an INDIA pale ale. Some sediment floating around, mostly at the bottom. Dark gold to light amber in hue. The arom reeks of every kind of citrus. Very complex hop nose with a little malt in the background. The balance of flavor is tilting towards hop overlod. Only a special group of beer enthusiasts can handle it. Lemons, oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, nectarines, even some limes, lets not forget the light floral hint detected from this beer. The name sake is perfect for this beer. The palate is definetly cloying and syrupy and resiny. Just coats the tongue and lingers till it decides to leave. A beer with some attitude thats for sure."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellowish/orangy color, nice carbonation, nice creamy whiteish head which hangs around for a little while, nice little islands and sticy lacing around the edges. Awesome scents of hops, sweet malts, citrus aplenty, and some spices. The taste is just delicious of hops, and citrus (grapefruit, pineapple), nice bitter/dry bite finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, a truly awesome DIPA. Thanks go to jhammerly and BuckEyeNation for the trades."
"Higher levels of carbonation help this brew out as it is heavy on the alcohol. Alcohol is evident and warms as it goes down and it somewhat lingers after swallowed in conjunction with a hop aftertaste. This beer is definitely something to be sipped, its too extreme to just quaff one after the other. I really don't think that I could drink a six of this in one sitting, the alcohol is just to upfront. The brew itself is good, but the alcohol ruins it for me. It'll be a long while till I come back to this one. I'd really like to try more DIPAs before coming back."
"Wow, this one is sooo damn good! Fresh grapefruity hops on the nose, with some malty goodness to balance it out.. I actually have had hoppy brews, but this one is so well balanced and drinkable. Pours a clear golden color with a thick head and nice lacing. Smells of pine nuts and grapefruit. I could drink 6 of these and lose my mind in a heartbeat. A hop lover's ecstasy!"
"Pours gold to peach in color and hazy with a medium white head that quickly fades back to a thin covering. Aroma is big citrusy hops, grapefruit and a little tropical fruit going on, some sweet pineapple juice. There is also a hint of grainy-grassiness. Taste follows with some sweet pineapple juice flavor up front that blends into some grapefruit bitterness. The bitterness is nice and even graduating into a citrus rind dryness. There is the hint of what could be an alcohol burn, but it never quite gets to a burn, just on the verge, and then warms the throat with the dry finish. Light to medium in body, the malts are plentiful enough to balance the hoppiness and accentuate the citrus and pineapple flavors, but not overpowering to make you think of a dipa-barleywine hybrid. The bitterness is not a huge kick in the teeth but is still large and nice and even from about mid-taste thru the finish. Very good beer easy to drink, deceptively strong."
"Overall Impression: I've been waiting for this beer for a long time now. WOW! Huge hoppy beer. Not over done, though. Still perfectly balanced. FRESH HOPS!! I couldn't stop appreciating the aroma. This is why Bell's is my favorite. Now, go pick up a sixer and enjoy this amazing beer. With a name like Hopslam, what did you expect?"
"Overall, fantastic. Too bad it sold out so quick."
"12 ouncer, no freshness indication, this was over $15 for a sixer, near Ann Arbor, MI. Pours cloudy orangy/apricot, near white head, that leaves nice, scattered and spotty lacing. Big and bold citrusy/resiny hop nose. Thick, chewy and smooth. Fine, fine stuff, god I love a world class DIPA like this one. Everything is in place here, nice job by Bells. Lots of citrus and hoppy goodness. Smooth and perhaps a bit more accessable and drinkable then the Stone 10th offering."
"Mouthfeel is lively yet smooth and the drinkability is ridiculous. It would be so easy to put too many of these away. One of the best beers I've had in a while."
"Well done, Bells!"
"D - I love hops, but this mouthfeel is unbearable. A beer that I can barely choke down with a huge glass of water is not a drinkable beer by any standards. I don't think I will have this again. It is definitely not sessionable. It might go with some foods since it has a somewhat mild flavor. All and all a beer I don't care for - it makes your breath and burps smell very nice though."
"A Slammin Hoptastic Pat on the Back to BigHuge for this beauty."
"Overall, IPA's aren't the first thing i'll reach for, but this is very approachable. A great new offering from Bell's..."
"What can I say I'm burping up hop candy come and enjoy here's my review. I've drank this beer every year since it's release every year enjoying it a bit more...sadly I looked back at 2006 and didn't realize how low I had scored it then. Never re-reviewing to realize that I've definitely enjoyed it much more than that as a whole. Brewed 12-29-11 that's as fresh as a six of Hopslam gets, and I've got 3 six packs at about 17 bucks a pop. Appears a slightly hazed golden orange hue with a creamy white thicket of head forming thick with chunks of scattered lacing. Aroma is usually explosive with grapefruit peel in this beer, and it still is with a sugar coated layer of candied hops. So green so fresh with hops, I can't get enough of each smell no real booze coming out in the nose, but there's a deep ridden hop pungency that makes you recognize. Flavor wise this seems to have fermented out a good bit this year not much honey sweetness and the yeast ate the heavenly malts and honey to unleash the devilish ten percent alcohol, which is showing up a bit more than I've realized in the past. No big deal I'm warm in the chest and still enjoying one of the hoppiest beers around, get slammed by the hops. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils carbonation really wraps itself around the palate, medium bodied flowing down. Overall a once a year beer experience that I won't soon forget, and look forward to every year."
"D: One of the best DIPA's that I have had. Can't wait to get more."
"A bit boozy and the hops/slight oxidation/slight fusels combo can be rough, especially as it warms, but overall, a decent DIPA. I'll stick to Stone and Centennial IPA."
"I swear that when i poured this i saw a hint of green in there for a second...like the hops were pureed right intot he beer or something. In the glass though its orange and full of little sediment bits floating around, like dirty pond water (in a good way). Small white head and mena looking lacing. Very inviting. Smells like grapefruit and melons, which reminds me of 3F's Dreadnaught. I am excited, Taste is very bitter on the first sip, in a citrusy kind of way. Alcohol is very had to detect underneath. Flavors of honeydew, grapefruit, hops (wait, no hopsLAM). It's really the grapefruit-iness that stands out. Not too heavy or syrupy, just full bodied and slightly fizzy on the tongue. Very drinkable, which is a problem because i cant afford this beer."
"Glowing orange appearance. Slightly hazed. Bubbly ivory white head. Lacing is substantial and weblike.The nose of this beer pure and simple kicks serious ass. All the citric goodness of lemon rind and pink grapefruit pulp along with canabis and smokey pine resin. The taste translates all of that goodness from the nose onto the palate. The bright citric tones of grapefruit and lemon. And smokey, resinous, raw Mary Jane. Bitterness is not clean, but not real abrasive either. Kind of in between. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Body is a little better than medium. Toffeeish malt way in the background, but there nonetheless. A top notch IIPA no doubt. One of the absolute best as a matter of fact."
"12 oz bottle. This beer is a perfect golden color with a fairly strong carbonation hitting the surface. A finger of stark white head falls to a full coating over top. Clarity is fantastic on this brew. This brew glows it is so brilliant. Aroma is thick with sweet grapefruity hop. Very sweet and luscious. The caramel malt underneath is sweet as well, but with a alcohol spiceyness in there that breaks the sweetness of the caramel and hop up. It is very juicy. Taking a sip, I get a combination of grapefruity hop and an alcholol spiceyness. The caramel malt hits after the initial taste as a mild sweetness. It finishes with a pepperyness from the hop, along with a more mild bitterness. I really like the major sweet hop flavors that dominate this one. Mouthfeel is thick, with a mild carbonation as well. It sits strong but is not syrupy or offensive. This one is really working well for me. I enjoy the fact that the hop manifests itself more as flavor than as bitterness. It really is a beer that doesn't need to be sipped, but should be due to the alcohol. I think Bell's has a winner."
"Hazed, tangerine-orange body with light white foam that quickly settles to a patchy ring around the glass. Smell can be summed up in two words: grassy hops! Damn! Taste is also dominated by grassy hops with citrus coming through in the middle. Splash of alcohol detected in the finish. Drying, light body mouth feel. You can feel the burn of bitter hops and alcohol all the way down to your gut. Out-f'n-standing beer! To put it into perspective, it reminds me of my unforgettable Pliny experience at Tria in Phlly. Could drink this forever if my teeth could withstand the enamel removal!"
"Via trade with akorsak, batch # 7690. Hazy wheat colored ale with a solid head that laced the glass. Extremely potent hop nose full of grapefruits and citrus rinds. The head is solid and it leaves a lace all over the glass. The range of flavors from the hops is quite extraordinary; ironically the only thing it lacks is extreme bitterness (which I don't seem to miss). Loads of dried fruit, citrus fruit, pine, leather, bug spray, and HOPS. Maybe zeus, tomahawk perhaps? The malts are there but play a minimal role; they kind of taste like light rye malts. The finish is clean, leaving you only with the intense smell of hops up your nose and down your throat; this is a beer that really makes you smell like beer. The way the hop bitterness fades away reminds me of a wet hopped beer. Alcohol is undetectable. This is one beautiful IPA. The burps from this one actually taste better than certain beers I've had! I was surprised to find it's rated at 106 ibu; I would have guessed down in the 70-80 range like Pliny the Elder. This may be the first 100+ ibu beer I really enjoyed. Heres to many more!"
"This is a pretty amazing beer. Somehow unique amongst the style in it's cleanness, different malt flavors, balance and lack of being intensely overwhelming. This isn't for everyone, but is should please the vast majority of hop heads. I worry about a hop hangover (I guess I'll know tomorrow). There is so much going on here that I'm glad I have several bottles to sample, as I believe each one might be a unique experience."
"All in all, another solid Bell's production. Much anticipated and VERY much appreciated. If you are a hopivore like myself, get you some. Thanks Al, for the pleasant surprise."
"This beer pours a light transparent orange color with a small white head that quickly diminished leaving fine lacing and a tiny head. Lots of suspended floaters in this one, even after a careful pour. The aroma is heavy with citrus, pine, punch and pineapple. Taste is more of the same with a huge hop/citrus punch. The bitterness is nice, but reasonable for a beer of this magnitude. Mouthfeel is nice... smooth, playful on the tongue. HopSlam is surprisingly drinkable for a beer this size. If it weren't for the alcohol, I could easily enjoy a few of these. Nice beer."
"Worth a look once or twice, but it's too much like spiked grapefruit juice to be a great beer."
"D- This beer has a great hop flavor with lots of depth and hop flavor is balanced by hop bitterness, while both are being enhanced by a slight sweet malt flavor. This taste like a splash of triple and a load of hops."
"lots of initial head on pour on orangey brown. I grabbed this as an IPA, and then I find out quickly its a double hophead and higher alcohol than I expected. Its a bitter, sucking the leaf sucking the lime hop delivery that works and is satisfying aftertaste, not in your face or substantial malting as in other DIPA. My tongue was frozen later on. Good carbonation. Good but overated."
"Had to bump it up a notch for the 08 batch. Many of the same characteristics as the 06 yet more rich and sweet. This batch seems to be a bit maltier."
"A good beer overall,the alcohol was not really detectable with all the hoppiness. I like the Two-Hearted a bit better. The Stone 10th was a lot better version of a double IPA for me."
"Mouthfeel: The beer is medium bodied. The active carbonation breaks it up a bit. The beer manages to have a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is very alcoholic but incorporates the alcohol well. The beer is easy to drink. I am hoping this one will be a yearly treat from Bell's. If you like strong hoppy beers this one is for you. At $15 a sixer its a bit pricey but man is it good!"
"What an unusual ale this is. Bells Two Hearted Ale is my everyday beverage. Hop Slam is totally different, with a different hop and malt profile, and is one of the best DIPA's I've sampled. Drinkability is limited only by availability."
"Drinkability: Like I stated at the top....the best there is...Two hearted is one of my favorites but I had no idea I would like this so much. Fuck the price, I will try to secure another case of this if possible. Truly the nectar of the gods.. It's been a long time since I popped in a 5.0 on this site and now I have had two in a week (including a Town Hall beer I have yet to enter)."
"A very nice IPA2!! Bell's did their homework with this one. The balance is spectacular! I could, and can, drink this til' tomorrow. In a word...YUM!"
"Medium to full bodied, fairly rich. Pretty dang refreshing and drinkable, nearly as good as some of the west coast IIPAs."
"Here is something nice. The best characteristic of this beer is the aroma. I poured this into one of those big Duvel glasses to get my nose right in there. Rich, earthy, fresh, grassy, citrus, are all words to describe the aroma. So classic and comforting a smell. Pours a rich autumnal orange, the color you only see in changing leaves and campfires. Decent head that dissipated quickly. I saw that this beer is at 106 IBU's and while I can believe it, it doesn't hit you over the head with hops as much as I expected. It has such a rich and creamy malt profile that it is very well balanced (as opposed to a beer like Hazed and Infused where it is essentially hop juice). Speaking of flavor, there is a lot going on here. I can taste tons of fruit character: pineapple, citrus; along with great hearty breadiness. Hops are majorly present in the taste as well. I suppose that this is worth the 17 dollars a six pack I paid (crazy, eh? but I love that local craft breweries are not afraid to take risks and make beers like this -- thus I must buy them and support the efforts to make American brewing even better)."
"Pours a cloudy gold with hints of red. Nice 1/2 finger head that left quickly. A smooth coating remained throughout. This beer smells awesome. Very piney on the hops side (I'd love to know what kind of hops are in here). Not much citrus or honey at all - all piney hops. The taste is very good. Very piney but not overly bitter like some DIPA's. The mouthfeel is great it bites at you all the way through. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 for drinkability is the 9% abv. Otherwise I could drink a lot of this stuff. Way to go again Bell's. These guys know how to make great beer. Now if I could just get up to Kalamazoo..."
"Verdict: lives up to and exceeds expectation. This is everything a DIPA should be."
"Batch 7690 according to the label. Pours a cloudy brilliant gold color, with a thick rocky white head. Seems more golden than most DIPAs. Great head retention. Huge tropical fruit in the nose, pineapple, citrus, peaches, etc. Very fruity and bitter, with a hint of pine coming through. Nice spots of lace cling to the side of the glass. The malt character does not seem as strong as others in this style. The amount of pineapple and peach flavor is very interesting. Very juicy and bitter. Nice body, with carbonation that seemed appropriate. Unique."
"Drinkability: Yes, yes and yes. I will want more of this. Awesome. A hop head's paradise!"
"I like this. Yet again, Bell's delivers."
"Bone dry yet silky texture."
"when i look back now , my taste buds might have been jaded from so many dipas ha, this is pretty bitter, but I still stand by my comments when I say its very balanced"
"Poured a slightly hazed coppery golden color with a full finger of bone white head that slowly fell back to a sticky lacing that coats the glass. Smell is grapefruity citrus, huge hoppy punch of hop resins and piney hops, also a big malty sweet backbone holding all of these huge aromas together. This beer is as hoppy as they come. Taste is much more of the same, starts sweet and of caramel maltiness before quickly becoming the grapefruity and citrusy flavors that lead onwards into the hoppy depths of this beast. Gargantuan hoppiness delivered with a bitterness and drying aftertaste to match. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with milder carbonation, slick and viscous brew. Drinkability is outstanding considering the 106 IBU's and 9.3% abv, staggering stats like that would make many beers undrinkable, yet Bell's has made this one enjoyable in a big way. The alcohol is hardly noticeable past the hoppiness, great bittering hop bite. Easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Truly a hop-monster in the flesh, try this beer if you can get a hold of it. Highly recommend, will seek out again."
"overall -- the only drawback here is the price. i could drink this on a regular basis, but at approx. $15 per six pack, i'll probably indulge once in a while. in the world of IPAs and DIPAs, this might be second only to Two Hearted."
"for a sixer) I probably won't be doing this often. Still, Bell's makes some fine hoppy ales. Strongly recommended."
"great DIPA"
"Good for those who like it rough. With pee."
"Overall, Hopslam is a really nice clean brew. IMO, for a DIPA, I think it is missing it's hoppy punch. Outside of that, this brew is really good and tasty. As a matter a fact, Bell's makes some of the cleanness, crispiness and tasty brews around. Buy a six and enjoy."
"overall: it's a recommended 6 pack to try, although it's a little pricey (or at least was where I found it). I'd probably by another six of it if in the mood for some fairly strong beer."
"Overall, everything is amazing about this beer, except maybe the flavor profile. It was so smooth and tasty for its strength it left me wondering where the complexity and promise for cellaring was. Also slightly tasted like pellet hops or hop concentrate, if there is such a thing. I want to love this more but it's daftly simple for a double IPA and too perfectly balanced when young. I'm torn and confused, intrigued and mesmerized. Damn you Larry Bell, I finally have a double IPA crack my top tier. Excellent work for now, but lets see what you can do for me down the road for the next 5 years. Off to the oubliettes you go, Hopslam."
"This brew pours a hazy orange color. The head is one finger in height and recedes into decent lacing. The aroma reminds me a lot of Two Hearted Ale, but with some added pine. The taste is like drinking a pine tree. There is resin everywhere with some citrus balancing things out. There is no malt backbone to speak of; this is all hops. The mouthfeel is nearly full bodied, chewy, and has nice carbonation. Overall, I really like this beer, but I would choose THA over it anyday."
"drinkability? despite the booziness, it goes down quick and has a perfect level of carbonation. i will have no problem finishing six of these brews."
"If you like hops with a balanced respectability, this beer is for you!"
"This one pours out to a good-looking copperish color in the glass with a decent-sized head. The aroma is that of pine and citrus. The taste is solid as a rock, with the citrus aroma carrying over to the flavor profile. Traces of grapefruit, orange and lemon are present that give way to a very, easy to swallow finish. Its hard to believe the ABV of this is 9.3%. Its hidden very well."
"drinkability: good"
"Man, i could drink a ton of this stuff if it wasn't so pricey. Would of liked to seen this in a bomber where one would be nice and two would be a blast. Glad i got to try it."
"The mouth is big and complex, great carbonation, well balance, dry and bitter on the end after a bright, citrusy middle. Extremely well balanced, and I think drinkable for even non-hop heads if they give it a chance to warm and their palates to adjust a bit. Phenomenal."
"Now, I just can't wait to tap a keg of it!"
"Larry, please tell us this one will be around every fall. HopSlam is truly exceptional!"
"Drinkability: A fine addition to the strata of interesting DIPAs, fruity, highly hoppy, and very easy to drink, that is, if you like hops."
"The bottom line: This is a damn fine beer and one of the best in its style that I have had. The hop profile is strong and also unique, and the beer is remarkably well balanced in flavour for being as big as it is. I never thought Bell's would be able to outdo their Two Hearted Ale, but I definitely think they have with this one...hopefully it becomes a regular seasonal offering!"
"The mouthfeel is what I expect from a grea DIPA. Medium non lingering or chunky. Just sweet bitter hops that fade and leave you wanting more. Did I mention this is easy drinking."
"Going in, I thought this might be like Two-Hearted on steroids as far as bitterness, but this was a very well-balanced beer. It is hoppy, but is more balanced than many DIPAs. I know I'll get some more!"
"Notes: A very good hoppy ale. One of the best i've had. My only complaint is the crappy limited production. This really should have a longer production run, if not year round availablity. What can I say? Larry Bell has one of his biggest hits yet, and it's gonna be gone in no time! That pisses me off, but in a good way!"
"Glad to get my grubby hands on this! Slight haze in a brassy orange body. Tight finger of dirty, off-white head. Nose is pure liquid hop flowers. It seriously smells like a freshly opened package of Simcoe/Centennial/??? flowers. Since I love this smell, I am in heaven right now. But, there's also a solid sugar honey malt background, along with some fruity alcohol. Bitter, acidic, hopslaught up front. Assaultive, but delicious. Hop burn stays, as sugary, tropical fruit malt swells and provides a hint of balance. The hint gets shrugged off by a dry, resinous, ganja-infused, bitter finish. My tongue is """bruised""" but happy. Medium-body, with a mouth-lacquering feel. Dry finish. This stuff is good and worth the wait!"
"I recommend this Double IPA to any hop head. Another great brew by Larry."
" Taste is dry for the style, which is a good thing for me. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor, the finish is clean and bitter. Mouthfeel is quite resinous, great drinkability as usual from Bell's."
"Always look forward to trying a new double IPA, especially when it's from Bell's. This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head the coated the glass with lace as it quickly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, both citrus styles-orange and grapefruit pointing to more hops than the Two Hearted. The flavor was of hops, citrus orange and grapefruit with a hint of caramel. The finish on this beer is a bit astrigent and the hops bitterness figure heavily as well, while adding a slightly creamy body. Similar to other double IPAs, but definately has that Bell style to it. A great beer, but at the alcohol level and price per 6 pack, probably still drink more Two Hearted than this. For these styles, I really wish they would make four paks or use bombers."
"The drinkability is easy for me. I live for a beer like this. A total sensory bludgeoning with precision and complexity. The feeling of well being that has settled upon me is wonderous. This is easily my favorite beer from Bell's. Is this going to be an annual release or a one off? Please, keep it coming! A great celebration ale. Call me immature and unrefined if you wish, but this beer needs to be felt."
"GOOD WORK BELL'S!"
" My numbers could have been a little higher for the mouthfeel, but Im not sure about the numbness on my tongue."
"I will certainly enjoy drinking this again, though."
"Drinkability - I never thought I would say this about beer but its almost to hoppy, """almost""" is key word. Absolutely overwhelming with the palate coating bitterness, but I still want more."
"Appearance - Similar to Two-Hearted but even cloudier. Rich white head that stay's with the beer throughout, even in the plastic cup they serve 16oz beers in. Aroma - a citrus-y orange-grapefruit. Taste - powerful hop domination bu believe it or not, the malt still weighs in. Creamy on the mouth, and perilously drinkable as the alcohol weighs in after the glass is gone. Has a taste profile similar to DFH 90 min, but has that more citrusy taste, as opposed to DFH's gin-like taste. Great stuff, hope they put this in the bottle for all the hopheads."
