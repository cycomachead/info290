4.72,10.8,4.75,4.5,4.75,5,4.75,"Overall, another impressive beer by the boys from Munster. This one is almost as good as Cimmerian sabertooth Berzerker, which I gave a 5. It all comes down to personal taste, of course, but this one was just a little too muted for me to consider it worthy of a 5. Still an awesome, awesome, awesome beer. I enjoyed every sip.","do_ob","Tuesday at 06:56 PM"

Syrupy sweet malt with candied lemon and a piney bitter finish that's - on the whole - rather balanced just goes on and on. A great beer, but not a great DIPA.","AgentMunky","Mar 27, 2015"

Honestly it smells like dirt~ Almost a bit bitter I feel like I have to end this #Breview as this one still taste good, I don't think it is tasting the way 3F's intended it (If so, it was less than Impressive)~ Overall: Incomplete (Stay tuned for a revisit)","BrewUSA","May 29, 2014"

Ethanol is easily felt and accentuated from the carbonation, appearing on the tongue, back of throat, and in the nostrils. A bit less carbonation would actually suit this beer better, making it more of a moderate sipper than a fizzy ale.

Amazing nose - pine, citrus and a hint of dank. The taste showcases a great malt backbone which perfectly balances the potent hop bitterness, lots of citrus and resinous pine. Finishes dry and bracingly bitter. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely well crafted double IPA. I am very impressed by FFF, who have given us two world-class double IPAs in this and Dreadnaught.","JohnG190","Oct 07, 2013"

5,17.4,,,,,,"Poured a cloudy medium gold, with about one finger of short-lived head. Left lacing. I noticed the pine and apricot in the aroma, as well as the taste. Less so the white wine and marmalade. It was reminiscent of a dry white in its texture and mouth feel, so that might be the reference. Has significant carbonation, which makes it a slower drinker, not at all bad given its ABV. A great Imperial IPA.","delta490","Sep 25, 2013"

Destroys your tongue, though that's not a bad thing at all. One of the easier Three Floyds brews to find if their beer is available in your area. It can be a little on the expensive side at $12 per bomber in this area. Though I prefer some of their other IIPAs generally, this is a very enjoyable beer. Highly recommended if you're seeking a palate wrecker.","hermit990","Aug 20, 2013"

Aromas of big orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, lemon zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, peach, mango, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA as expected. Big hop flavor complexity and balance with moderate malts; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2013"

The nose is also exceptionally citrusy with notes of fresh squeezed oranges, candied orange peels, and grapefruit. The taste is spot on with a potent candy sweetness upfront followed by a slightly dry grapefruity bitterness. The mouthfeel is elegant - sweet malt, slight yeast, citrus hops, masked alcohol, and a semi-dry, modestly bitter finish. This beer deserves a world class rating, especially considering drinkability and price.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 18, 2013"

The nose explodes with massive hop aromas. Citrus such as fresh grapefruit, orange, and apricot. This is a serious fresh hop, pine, and citrus bomb. Great body. Seriously. So creamy and smooth. Feels fantastic and the flavors are absurd. This has so much complexity for being such a hop bomb. The IBUs are off the charts but the hop character is so enjoyable. There some booze, some really dry qualities, and a bit of cloying sweetness, but outside of that it's a flawless beer. Wow.","Gatch","May 25, 2013"

It's not brought in to replace Apocalypse Cow as its not a seasonal. It's just a world class bunch of brewers saying hey we can make as Manu of these as we want to, we can make as many as we want and keep all of them world class, we can sell every one of them, and there isn't a damn thing you can do to compete with us. This rounds out a solid family of FFF and I'm a believer of these guys. Ill buy Dreadnaught every single time over panzer wolf and I'll always look for apocalypse cow in summer, but there are times when I drink up all the Dreadnaught before the next months delivery. What will I do? I'll buy this because it's a solid DIPA. I mean it's still good stuff. It's not Dreadnaught, but hey! It wasn't intended to be. It wasnt intended to be better than dready. It was crafted to give you a bite when you really need it. Hence the snarling wolf on the label. We will all drink our Dreadnaught, but we will need a bit more bite a few times of year.","BradtheGreat7","Apr 28, 2013"

Scents of citrus hops, malt, slight white grape and hints of molasses. Flavor begins with a hit of dry malt, overwhelmed by bitter hops, moves into grapefruit pith and citrus hops and finishes dry with a bitter grapefruit pith flavor and aftertaste. There is a slight sweetness from the malt but it is overwhelmed by the hops. Definitely a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, quite easy to drink. It hides it's alcohol fairly well. A very good hop bomb IIPA. An even more hop forward Hop Stoopid, beyond Hopslam, Ruination, Hoptimum and 90 Minute and it even comes across as more hop forward than 120 Minute, as it lacks much of the sweetness. A great hophead DIPA, I am glad I finally got to try it. Just a shame about that distribution.","Auraan","Apr 18, 2013"

A true citrus-hop bomb indeed. Pours a hazy orange-copper, with a thin creamy head that dissipates fairly quickly which is fine with me. Where do I start with the aroma? The only way I can describe it, is like freshly sliced fruit salad sitting on a bed of pine needles. I gotta say, this is one of the best smelling DIPA's I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. To say this beer is a hop-bomb is an understatement! Big hop's way up front, yet sweet and malty on the finish, and it tickles my nose like champagne.

Huge citric-pine aroma with just a touch of light maltiness. A touch of herbal and light stone fruit flavors, as well. West Coast in styling but still stands apart from any other DIPA that I’ve tried. Smooth and fairly light on the palate. No noticeable booziness. Good stuff.","popery","Beers"

Not sure how fresh the bottle is (no date), but not much punch in terms of bitter hops. A bit of tangerine and apricot, with a lingering grapefruit tartness. Not super impressed here, but not a bad beer. Something about this style of IPA just doesn't do it for me. The bitter dryness cuts into the juicy citrus in a way that I don't dig. Also gave me a headache for some reason, so maybe that was taking away from things.","BMMillsy","Jan 16, 2013"

Hop vegetable matter is noted floating after the second half of the bomber is poured. The head retention is better than average. I stick my nose in and, hello grapefruit! Lovely, lovely grapefruit. Mouthfeel is nearly as lovely. Soft, full, wet, but not juicy. The hop hotness cuts what otherwise might express as juiciness. Perfect amount of carbonation scrub on the back of the tongue. Megagrapefruit, some pine around the edges of the tongue, light sulfur, and a bit of onion. This beer's my hero. One of the best from FFF, in my opinion.","DocJitsu","Dec 25, 2012"

The beer gave off a big hoppy aroma, citrus and pine. The alcohol was noticeable as the beer warmed. The taste was very good, again, big citrus and pine hops, but also some malty goodness in there and I think that I detected a hint of pepper as well. The beer had a heavy feel to it, sticky and a little like syrup. Overall, I would say that this is a really good DIPA, perhaps I would have liked it more, but I am really over the style.","PhillyStyle","Oct 25, 2012"

The flavor offers a beautifully blended grass-pine hop bitterness with oak caramel and some alcohol presence. Nutty and a bit leafy. Medium bodied with a soft, well blended carbonation. Very smooth stuff with a little kick. Though it's quite hoppy as I typically like this style to be, there's a bit more alcohol than I like to taste. Nice enough.","Durge","Sep 09, 2012"

I particularly liked the aftertaste, kind of a lingering bitterness in the background. The alcohol kind of sneaks up on you because you can't really taste it.","CHK","Jun 13, 2012"

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Medium to slightly full-bodied for the style, with medium carbonation. Somewhat hefty mouthfeel seems appropriate given the huge and bold hoppiness. As others have said, this isn’t the most drinkable beer; it’s both alcoholically strong and bordering on the extreme (well past for some) in terms of hopping. Puts me in mind of Surly’s Abrasive, which I think is perhaps a slightly better beer.","tobelerone","Beers"

Touch of pine, but this is bright in a very fruity way. Taste has more jammy notes (marmalade as the label suggests, and this is bang on I think). More tropical fruits, resin and a bittersweet finish. Definitely unique in hop profile and malt character. Medium full body, medium low carb and lightly drying. Certainly a unique DIPA in a variety of ways, wish I knew how fresh this was.","liamt07","Jun 08, 2012"

Very intensely grassy and citrusy tasting. Unless you really like hops this beer is probably not for you. Still it is quite amazing, although I prefer Dreadnaught.

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"22 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy golden-orange color with a slight reddish hue, fluffy white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malt, caramel, orange, pine, spices and peaches. Flavor is sweet, caramel, orange, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium, slick texture and has a bitterness that sticks on the tongue for a while. Very good beer, nice balance for such a largely hopped beer.","mtstatebeer","0"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"My favorite DIPA from Three Floyds. Terrific body, crisp. Alcohol bite is a little more present here than in Dreadnaught, but the dose of hops in this helps smooth it back out. It doesn't pack the hop aroma that I get from, say, a Hopslam, but the flavor is all there. I've had this on-tap and in bottle, and both are very similar, with on-tap having a little better aroma (I'm thinking I served my own bottle a little colder than in the pub). A bit pricey at the liquor stores, but if you shop around and can get it for a good price, it's hard to beat.","Prostman81","Feb 14, 2012"

Arctic Panzer Wolf pours a bright orange color, with a nice one finger off white head. Excellent lacing on the side of my snifter. Slightly hazy in appearance. The nose is citrus fruit- pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, as well as pine and earthy hops. It's definitely a smoother more balanced nose than the taste. However, this isn't a balanced beer- and that's fine. It's awesome in what it's going for. The taste is bitter hops, with a malt backbone that smooths it out towards the end. Still, my palate is somewhat wrecked from the hops half way through this bottle, they seem to stick around forever. Big time hops/pine aftertaste. Feel is medium, bitter, and a dry hoppy finish- really dry. I don't really get any of the 9% ABV in this beer at all. Overall, a totally solid and great DIPA. Cheers!","jayhawk73","Jan 05, 2012"

Heavy handed dry hopping with dank baggies, pine needles and grapefruit juice. Leaves a long lingering lemon/grapefruit/citrus on the palette after each sip has hit the gullet. Medium to thick body for an IPA, moderate to low level of carbonation with a sticky resinous bitter mouthfeel. I liked this one, but I found the bitterness a little harsh and heavy on the lemon.

FFF makes some of the best hop-forward beers available and this ones no different.

I get a slightly """off""" aroma, almost like industrial cleaner or vinegar, but aside from that the nose is quite enticing, and the flavour is spot on for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is slick, medium bodied, astringent grapefruit bitterness lingers in the bone dry finish. The 100 IBUs are evident on the palate.

4.27,0.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Arctic Panzer Wolf pours nearly completely hazy. It vacillates between tangerine and straight orange, and has about two fingers of white head. The foam shows both retention and lacing that are alright, but fail to impress (second pour was across the board better, and earned a small score bump). The nose is very tropical fruity. Smells like lots of Amarillo and/or Citra to me. The white wine promised in the writeup on the bottle is present as well, but a little more elusive. Finally, pine shows up as a barely there aroma. While there were no malty notes present in the nose, there is a little bit of bread and caramel sweetness to lead things off flavor wise. Just a little though, before we get to the business at hand, namely hops. Mid palate bitterness is pronounced, yet smooth. It demands attention without taking a scorched earth approach to my taste buds. White wine is more prominent here than in the nose, it comingles with apricot and more tropical fruits for leading flavors. Pine is still very much a background accent, but has more oomph here. The body is pleasantly light for a 9% beer, especially since it's not as bone dry flavor wise as some west coast interpretations of the style. Carbonation is spot on, a little high and it adds to the beer's brightness of flavor. I love this beer for the same reason I love Nelson from Alpine. It's not only a very well crafted version of the style, but the inspired hop choices result in a unique brew that escapes the rote (if not still enjoyable) citrus/grapefruit notes of most IPAs and imperial versions. This is one that separates itself from the pack and I would gladly seek out again.","axeman9182","Aug 21, 2011"

And if I ever do experience that in a fresher bottle, I shall have to come back and redo this review.

The aroma included...hops...not question. There were hints of pine and citrus. The taste was full bodied with great balance between the hop characteristics and elevated IBU. It was quite smooth. The mouthfeel was downgraed slightly due to the higher ABV...which would make it tough to session. Definitely worth a try.","WoodBrew","Jul 22, 2011"

Wonderful white head about a finger thick, disappears quickly, leaving a ring about the circumference. In the nose I pick up sweet melon, piney hops, grapefruit. On the tongue it is sweet, but quite bitter. Hops give a great snap, backed by the citrus. A bit of must from the yeast. But it matches. Mouthfeel is good, great carb and easy to drink.

Poured a hazy golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tangerine, fruit hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, orange, tangerine, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The hops on this one were a little faded if I am honest. This did however allow the fruit character on this one to shine through quite nicely. The aroma on this one was pretty good with the tangerine hanging around on your nose mixed with the fruity hop note. A definite must try if you get the chance as this was a nice example of the style, even without the hop presence.","thagr81us","Jul 11, 2011"

Pours a slightly hazy tangerine hue with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a soapy bull's eye swirl with a creamy band around the edges. Some spots of lacing but no legs. Nose expresses grapefruit sweetness, tropical fruits, citrus rind and an earthy quality - all in that order. Taste reveals citrus, but the sweetness is much more subdued than suggested by the nose. Earthy/piny/rind character comes out towards the middle and back. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with lively carbonation that is evenly distributed from start to finish. Finish is crisp and semi-dry.

Crisp, fruity, bitter. Kudos to this beer for tasting completely unique. It's definitely 'not normal' as they say. Pretty incredible beer. I can barely taste the alcohol but I can feel it.

4.12,-3.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This bottle arrived a week ago and features the new label. This beer pours a very, very pale gold in color with a one finger bright white head that quickly dissipates. It looks like a traditional pale ale. The nose is of grapefruits, citrusy hops, and I get an odd spiciness to finish it off. It smells great and you can smell the glass from a few feet away. It tastes of sweet citrusy and lightly piny hops with a soft pale malt backbone. It works well and is a pretty light drinker compared to most DIPAs that're pretty sticky and feature caramel malts. It does finish pretty dry though and is a gateway to cotton mouth. I am a fan of this one and I think it's better out of the bottle than on tap.","aasher","Jun 07, 2011"

4.42,3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Many thanks to Alex (page101) for hooking me up with this on an awesome trade! Slightly hazy yellow-orange pour with one finger head with decent retention and nice lacing. One of the lightest colored Imperial IPAs I've had. Lots of floral west coast IPA citrus in the nose with this one, complemented nicely with piney resin. Lemon and grapefruit are most prominent with a hint of caramel malt. The taste is dominated by huge citrus notes. Tons of grapefruit and tangerine with a great bitter hop bite. With that said, plenty of sweet malt to balance it out perfectly. The alcohol is almost non-existent making this scary drinkable for an imperial. When you get into this level of quality, it's hard to distinguish which is beer is better. This is right up there with Pliny, Dreadnaught, Sculpin, etc. It's only my second Three Floyds beer ever, but I think it's safe to say that Three Floyds lives up to all the hype!","beerdrifter","May 24, 2011"

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit, apricots, orange peel) and pine hops. Flavor is mainly bitter hops. Both the citrusy and pine flavors are noticable, but initially the bitterness is strong and lingers around for a while before it eases up.

Mouthfeel is medium to high carbonation and a medium body. I have a feeling this beer is old. Three Floyds, DATE YOUR BOTTLES.

Potent mango-pine aroma, classic strong IPA aromas, but a little on the fruity side. The flavors blend very well, you can certainly feel the bitterness, but there is also a lot of strong sweet fruity flavors to compensate, I got practically no alcohol flavors. Palate is good, a bit slick but very enjoyable nonetheless. Medium bodied with average carbonation, and a very slight syrupy texture. Bites more than a Dreadnaught which this one cannot match.

On the nose there is a huge hop presence, more like an orange than like a grapefruit, with the pine further back. On the tongue the piney hop character comes to the front with the citrus notes riding behind. In the mouth the body is medium, a bit lighter than I would have expected, and there is a great prickly pine and alcohol note that lingers for a long while. I split the bomber with the lady and I probably could have had the whole thing, but probably not more than that. Pretty drinkable for a DIPA.","EricCioe","Feb 02, 2011"

APW was slightly duller in color (cloudy golden/yellow) and had less head retention. Otherwise this exceeded AC in every other facet. Aroma is a unique blend of herbal, floral and citrus hops. Grassy and grapefruit rind like. Flavor is dank, bitter, dry and hoppy. A strong toasted malt body with minimal sweetness balances out a dry rind and bitter grapefruit hop body. Much more resiny, than the sweet AC; this drank much smoother and was a more enjoyable DIPA.","yourefragile","Feb 02, 2011"

I guess the hops are sufficient (I so don't want to say """more hops"""), and it's the FEEL that seems lacking--too thin and dry. Is it fair? Should I share that I keep thinking about Hopslam's arrival as I sit here sipping? I don't know what to blame...I look back at the bottle and pick the Canadian malt (damn Canadians--j/k). It's not bitter enough. It's not sweet enough. Oh, geez, it's not Hopslam enough, okay? It's good but, unfortunately, forgettable. Still, it's good enough to drink all day.

The taste is a big smack of bitterness upfront that is very dry and mineral-like in taste. I pick up a slight medicinal quality before I get light malt and another smack of hop bitterness. Not much else in the taste but straight bittering hops. Finishes relatively heavy and warms as it goes down. Not very drinkable due to the huge bitterness.

One of the best Imperial IPAs I've ever had, if the not THE best. I give it this credential because some Imperial IPAs are way over the top with """as much hops as a man (or woman) can take," giving the beer just too much in one direction and lacking any kind of balance or elegance. This beer is well rounded, with mellow flavors settling down the sharp hops. The ABV is hardly noticeable. The flavor is rich and gigantic without being too strong. Fabulous beer from 3 Floyds.

The flavor is full of juicy grapefruit and peach hoppy notes up front with a considerable bitterness developing on the midpalate. The midpalate also has a mild biscuit malt backbone, and the dry finish, along with a lingering grapefruit bitterness, has a moderate booziness. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice alcohol warming effect.

3.8,-10.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"The taste shows a marked difference from its brewery-mate. Whereas Dreadnaught has a heavy accent on fruit flavors and builds its hop presence on a sturdy malt backbone, APW is unapologetic about its hop fundamentalism. Right out of the chute, it hits you with lemongrass, onion, mint and a hefty pine flavor. There's a bit of biscuity malt and grapefruit sweetness that comes in to keep things from getting too insane, but then the intense bitterness reestablishes itself at the end. The finish also shows a bit more of its alcohol than Dreadnaught. Overall this beer has the goods to fulfill your lupulin needs and is well worth your time. I know it's sacriligeous to say, but I prefer more malt depth to my DIPAs (think Dreadnaught, Abrasive and Dorado).","chicagobeerriot","Jul 09, 2010"

Dreadnaught is a major favorite of mine, so it is a tough battle, but the APW holds up well. It is a bit different, I find this more citrusy and a bit more syrupy than Dreadnaught...gonna have to search out a fresh Dreadnaught to do a side by side to be sure though. 9.0% makes it tough to drink a lot of, but that is really the only detractor for me. This is a very good DIPA...I could drink one of these every night for a little while and be happy.","portia99","Jun 27, 2010"

It pours a hazy light peach amber color with a huge foamy off white head that resists fading and leaves spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is aggressive and the fruity pineapple, peach and tangerine aroma is mirrored in the taste. Medium tangy body and creamy mouth feel enhance the drinkability. Full flavored, the fruity pineapple peach tangerine hoppiness was worth the trip!! I could drink these all afternoon. Highly Recommended.","GbVDave","Oct 17, 2009"
3.97,-6.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to my buddy for picking this one up. It's tremendous, giving Dreadnaught and Apocalypse Cow runs for their money. It's a beautiful amber/copper color with decent head/retention. Smell and taste are both FFF DIPA-esque, with big grapefruit notes. This one deviates a little with some more piney hops as well. Taste here is a bit more bitter than the other FFF DIPAs, but it's tremendous. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, perfect for this one. Drinkability is scary with the ABV and how good this one is. A must buy.","thedrewski86","Oct 14, 2009"

It had a nice, hoppyness to it, typical piney smell. Good golden color, Three Floyds did not let anyone down here. It's got that kick in the ass that all their beers have, not for the weak of heart! While I enjoyed this immensely, I would not get it again when their Dreadnaught IPA is always on tap for $2 less. Honestly, the Dreadnaught is stronger and has much more hoppy bang for the buck than this.","younger35","Sep 27, 2009"
