There is the hint of malt in the background, just enough to bring out all of those hops. The taste is California, citrus and tropical fruits, there is a hint of spice and pine. A very good sipping  beer not over powering at 10.5 percent. Cheers","dalahodson","Dec 07, 2014"

Small slightly off-white head that dissipates and leaves minimal lace.  The aroma is floral, dank and resinous.  Taste follows smell with thick resin combined with floral spice and caramel malt.  A delicious beer that maintains its fresh hoppiness as it warms and aerates.  Mouthfeel is perfect for a double IPA.  Overall, this is a wonderful beer from Stone.","FFreak","Nov 18, 2014"

I do wonder if the hops have tapered off some because it is more malty and less hoppy than I thought it’d be, but still tastes great. Good amount of sweetness, but still quite bitter. My guess fresh this is great. Today I think it is very good.","kkleu357","Oct 02, 2014"

(though based on the BA reviews there are a lot of people who think otherwise) The flavors here are very clear and concise.

I know they're more man than me and that I am not worthy. I loved the look, smell, and feel, but the overall flavor was just too bitter for me. Each flavor was huge and the quality was evident, but the balance was tilted far too heavily in favor of the bitterness for my poor palate. And again, I'm sure that was the point.","tmm313","Aug 09, 2014"

Coats your whole mouth and leaves a dry oasis after each sip.  Alcohol is moderately present in this DIPA.  Reminiscent of Anderson Valley Heelch O' Hops.

Well carbonated providing a slightly lighter body to a getting close to heavy beer. Heavily effects both sweet and bitter taste buds. Starts off bold with a sticky sweet start, not completely but fairly smooth with a oily bitter finish. Slight warming effect from the alcohol. Overall and absolutely delicious well rounded full beer. Another home run from Stone. I'm glad it was brewed again, I missed out last year. If this is coming out every summer (which is what I hear), then I will try to seek it out.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 03, 2014"

But at the end of the day you pay for what you get and what you're getting is a top notch beer... seriously, go buy it and try it now! I promise you that you'll have no regrets.","matt22871","Jul 24, 2014"

RuinTen is a beast that demands respect and earns it with relative ease in just a few sips. A mandatory must-try for hopheads. I'm dying to try this bottled, as well.","ThePaintedGrey","Jul 13, 2014"

This is a fantastic beer and I'm consistently impressed with Stone and their piney versions of this style.","Qbdoo","Jul 12, 2014"

Rip grapefruit, tropical fruit, and sticky sweet malt aromas with floral hop and boozy notes. Medium bodied with subdued carbonation and a slick oily feel. Intense flavor of ripe pineapple, grapefruit, and orange rind with a sticky sweet caramel backbone. Tangy floral hop flavors through the middle that transition to boozy, light pine hop flavors at the end. Finished with lingering floral and pine hop flavors and a definitive booziness.

The smell was loaded with grapefruit and was so intoxicating, it made me hold it up to my nose for several seconds at a time. The taste was beyond perfect in the hop assault, as the grapefruit was concentrated into a strong tonic. In addition to the citrus fruit, I could also sense flavors of butterscotch, pineapple, and strawberry. The body was dense, sticky, and oily, leaving a coating of hops in place of the original mucous that had been stripped off my tongue. The finish was spicy and boozy. I got this at Green's just a month from bottled on date, and it was oh so splendidly fresh.","rajendra82","Jul 03, 2014"

4.32,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/9/2014. Pours crystal clear golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly sticky/crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA. All around awesome complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate light caramel malt sweetness; and very smooth and fairly crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 28, 2014"

4.9,13.7,5,5,5,4.5,4.75,"O- RuinTen gives Enjoy By IPA a run for its money! Although two totally different hop profiles, I will give the nod to RuinTen as a result of the heftier malt backbone...the hop-to-malt balance is just perfect making it that much more drinkable considering the ABV (and the labeled, 10.8% ABV does not disappoint)! However, RuinTen does not remind me so much of its in genesis in Ruination IPA. Although still dank, oily and resinous, Ruination has a black tea component in the aroma and flavor that does not translate in RuinTen...the latter replaces that essence with that of a tropical (i.e. passionfruit) vibe courtesy of the addition of Citra in the dry hop. However, three years since their initial Ruination anniversary brew (of which preceded Enjoy By IPA), this stands to be my favorite of the lot. (4.75)","threeviews","Jun 27, 2014"

The grain bill is completely taking over this beer and the hops are not nearly as balanced this go around, mostly all pine and subtle citrus in smell and taste. To much malt is adding a unbalanced sweet taste that does not mesh well with the hops.","jdprmd","Jun 20, 2014"

Copper appearance with a thin foam rim and big alcohol legs. Taste is extremely bitter hops upfront, subsiding into tangerine, mango, orange, tropical fruits, big buttery caramel and biscuit malts. Finish is extremely dry with more bitter hops and moderate booze. Overall, what else can I say? It's an already amazing beer but, even more amped up. Ruinten is Ruinten; and Ruinten is damn good stuff.","IAmAPenguin","Jun 19, 2014"

Smells like a hop explosion with some citrus in the background.  Very hoppy bitter beer with a strong boozy taste and sweet taste of pineapple and some type of citrus.  Medium body and carbonation.

It's a sensation i last recall when first trying regular Ruination when i was newer to craft brews. I didnt care much for the aftertaste then. Now, having tried numerous IPAs of many shades, i can say i now enjoy the deal better. Big beer, big taste. Bitter pine is juicy when massive hops are used. It is here, and i find it delicious.","TBoneJones","Jan 28, 2014"

The bitterness is a lot sure but it fits in with the orange, citrus, grapefruit flavors perfect.

A really big beer that is also surprisingly smooth to me. This beer is right up there with some of the most aromatic IPAs that I've had.","PaulyB83","Nov 14, 2013"

Not much of a head to speak of this time, but the taste is still awesome, and although the bitterness builds somewhat in the back of the mouth, it does not linger annoyingly. Remains one of my personal top-rated DIPAs, but I am reducing the appearance rating from 4.5-3.75 for the disappointingly nearly non-existent head, the smell rating from 4.5-4 since citrus is less evident, and the mouthfeel rating from 4.5-4 because it seems less exceptionally smooth now.","scotorum","Oct 16, 2013"

Pours copper golden and clear with a small white head. Massive grapefruit aroma with huge floral aromatics. Big slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation (on the low side for an IPA). Flavor of pine hops, very fresh. Some grapefruit and definite floral hop flavor. A bit of malt backbone here, but highlights the bitter as a Ruin(beer) should. Missed out on this last year and glad they brought it back. More flavor than regular ruination, but playing second fiddle to Enjoy By. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","Oct 12, 2013"

Yes this is a hop bomb that tastes like it smells but I really liked this one because while dry and somewhat of a tastebud nuker, to be honest, I got a medium-bodied beer with good hops and some sweet fruit hop and sweet malt flavorings. The amount of sweetness and balanced packed into this beer is quite unexpected. A sweeter than most DIPA that can still pack a hop wallop is just fine with me and glad I tried this one.","clayrock81","Aug 15, 2013"

While the beer has more balance than ruination, there is still a lot of building bitterness. Pine and grapefruit, very classic west coast ipa flavors with lots of sticky sweetness beneath it all to balance. Finishes with a touch of alcohol heat. I think I prefer regular ruination. Definitely a palate ruiner and wont really go with most foods but it's good. Not as special as I thought it would be though. Malt adds a stickyness that takes away from the hops just a bit unlike something like a terrapin hopzilla.","jtierney89","Aug 13, 2013"

3.58,-16.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22oz bottle. 2013 Edition. Pours a clear copper with a rigid and slightly off-white colored head. This leaves behind rich sudsy lacing that sticks. The aroma has a strong herbal and piney presence with some underlying zesty green citrus character. Bready malt is pronounced along the back and gives this some thickness in the nostrils. The herbal flavors get stronger as this warms. The taste is sweet (and a little boozy) with malt and warmth. Heady herbal flavors drive this but there are some more aggressive notes of resins and fresh bitterness that run down the middle of the tongue and really hang in the finish. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a slick creamy feel and a bit of crispness that pops in the mouth. That alcohol is strong here, even getting a little stinging in spots. I really wanted to like this more but it ultimately just got to be a little too medicinal feeling with its boozy sweetness and strong herbal character.","Kegatron","Aug 05, 2013"

The aroma is tropical fruits and makes me want to drink it. The taste is pure tropical fruit from start to finish with just enough malt to keep my tongue from going numb. It is medium bodied with mild carbonation and represents the style quite well.","KidKrafty","Aug 04, 2013"

Smell is huge pine, mango, tangerine, apricot, and grapefruit. Taste is all of that and punches you in the face with grapefruit in finish and lingers on the tongue. Body is large, plenty of life, a bit dry like its son, and very approachable for its heft. This isn't for everyone, but I love this beer!

Scents of grapefruit, citrus, orange rind, pine, floral and grassy notes, sweet malt, and tropical fruit. An excellent nose, that entices you to begin drinking this wonderfully aromatic beer. Flavor is intense, beginning with beginning with strong grapefruit notes and citrus rind, moving into pine and grassy flavors, still maintaining the heavy grapefruit and citrus flavors, moderate flavors of resinous hops. There is a nice sweet malt backbone that stays throughout the sip and balances the hops. There is a noticeable alcohol presence and the finish is bitter, with a very bitter hop aftertaste. Excellent, a true hop bomb, but with a nice balance with sweet malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sticky hit with slight alcohol burn as well. A nice mouthfeel that burns just enough and is just right in the body to go down smooth, but still remain strong. A fantastic hop bomb DIPA, similar in many ways to the Enjoy By, but with a slightly heavier body and more malt and alcohol presence. The hops are also a bit more forward. Truly excellent and I am glad I was able to find a bottle.","Auraan","Aug 01, 2013"

Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and floral hops with honey and biscuit malt with pineapple esters. Flavor is heavy hops and bitterness with supporting sweet malt, fruity esters, resinous pine and a dry finish. Full body and moderate carbonation throughout. Overall, a very delicious hop bomb from Stone. This quickly became my favorite in addition to their Enjoy By IPA series.","CuriousMonk","Jul 22, 2013"

A slight cookie sweetness is present, but it's mostly astringently hoppy with a whiff of alcohol. Seriously hop-forward flavor backed by a pale malt sweetness. Grapefruit, pine resin bitterness, pineapple, tangerine, and melon. Oooo tasty...and not too sweet at all, which I didn't expect. Aggressive, crisp, and surprisingly not too strong feeling either. I mean, it feels "big," but I enjoy it, and I should know to trust Stone with hoppy beers after years of proof. I remember drinking Ruination for the first time, now it almost seems tame in relation to what DIPAs have evolved to be, but this sort of brings back that "holy shit that's hoppy" feeling.","wedge","Jul 20, 2013"

Pours a beautiful copper orange hue with big thickets of off white head, forms thick with lovely bubbles flowing forth. Aroma has big citric rind, dank resinous hops, floral and earth notes colliding this is a hop explosion of a beer I bought a case and shared half. Flavor juicy hops hit the palate with big malts colliding with the beer what a great experience hop resin in a bottle it's slick and oily through each sip, you almost have to love this if you're a true hop head. Everything about it screams Stone from the hop burps, to the intense mix of flavors that provide a beer experience I haven't had yet to the cohesive drinkability that I can't believe this beer is this easy to consume. I don't blink an eye it goes down smooth with every sip but at the same time there is raw intense hop flavors that most brewers haven't touched upon yet flowing across the palate it's extreme on more than one front excellent effort from a veteran in the craft brewing scene.","WVbeergeek","Jul 17, 2013"

Smells of lots of pineapple and grapefruit, grass, tons of floral, mango, papaya, resin. Not getting much malt and maybe a hint of booze. Taste starts with grapefruit and floral notes. The middle brings lots of sweetness, as well as some breadiness; however, this just barely mellows out the hops. The finish is very big, but still complex. Tons of tropical fruit notes like mango, papaya, and pineapple. Definitely used citra hops in this. Big resin notes and accompanying bitterness. Some earthiness and grassiness. Not much malt to speak of, as the abrasive bitterness covers up the breadiness. The hefty sweetness is necessary to somewhat calm the finishing flavors. Decent amount of booziness along with a warming sensation. Full body with an oily and slick mouthfeel. Just punches you in the face with abrasive, bitter hops.

3.9,-9.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,4,"The beer pours a pale orange with a minimal head of tiny white bubbles. The beer’s body is clean with light carbonation bubbles trundling up throughout the glass. On the nose, the beer smells a little strange. Catty notes with nice, pine punches from the original Ruination recipe, are what come through from the hops while the malt is quite big and sticky on the nose with stale caramel and bread notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes hugely bitter and very sweet with a light tart bite from the acid in the beer, the mouth sends a lot of spittle to keep the mouth neutral. In flavor, the beer begins with a sticky sweet, catty flavor that is not my favorite, but as the beer opens, ruinous pine notes clobber aside the catty notes. Alongside the raping pine is a sweet caramelly bread, which sits lighter on the tongue than the ruinous pine. The finish is of prickly pine with a touch of citric bite, while the finish is of sweet, mellowing caramel malt. In the mouth, the beer feels slightly slick and syrupy in the mouth, sitting on the light side of heavy in the mouth. Carbonation is light and smooth with a slight tingle of bubbles and then a bite from the bitters. The mouth is left sticky with saliva and hop resin. Overall, I wasn’t too impressed for my first few sips, but as I went the beer got better to drink. There is a little bite of alcoholic heat, but overall it covers up its 10+% ABV very well and is quite nice to sip. I like this beer, though it’s not what I would initially reach for when going for a DIPA, but it is nice to sip and it definitely gets you with its ABV. A beer worthy of a try.","Maxwell","Jul 06, 2013"

This beer is very intense as expected but what I was so impressed with was the finish. most imperial IPAs are on the maltier side and they typically have a bitter fist to the tongue for an after taste. this had an extremely smooth finish for the amount of hop presence.

Again, the hops lean more towards earthy and floral tones. Pretty sweet overall with not THAT much bitterness in the end. This is more about the flavor of the hops over crushing bitterness, although there is a bitterness that lingers on and on. Mouthfeel is a tad thick and sticky, but not exaggeratedly so.

I bought a bottle just to do a sanity check and further verified my initial opinion. This beer is outstanding. The only somewhat downfall is that it is pretty heavy in the mouthfeel department. Stone has outdone themselves with this one. I'll take this over the Enjoy By any day.

Considering the price point, it is an absolute monster. This is one thing that Stone has consistently been very very good about. Controlling for the inflation inherent in bombers, they manage to make consistently good to great beers at relatively reasonable prices. If you like any of the descriptors I used in this review, go get this beer today. If you're not as big on hoppy citrus bombs, it's still worth trying unless you really really don't like the bitter side of brewing (because this is definitely the bitter side of things).","kemoarps","Jun 29, 2013"

Stone went all out on this, and it's pretty hard to rate this to style, it's sort of it's own unique thing. I think i may prefer Ruination to this, and by prefer I mean I could drink it more easily on a regular basis. This is something every hop head should seek out and try, but far from Stone's best beer. Glad I tried it, but I thought it could have been a little better. I would have liked more tropical, fruity, floral notes instead of straight pine and it seemed a little too sweet for my liking. However, it does do it's job, completely destroys your palate. I will drink my other one in a few days and possibly re edit my review.","Roman5150","Jun 28, 2013"

Stone is not bashful with the hops in their IPAs, and this is probably the hoppiest of the bunch. Pine and citrus exchange blows, but I think pine is the primary flavor I get. Sweet malts are not prominent, but they do make themselves known. This is a very good IPA, but I don't think it lived up to my expectations. If given the choice, I would take Enjoy By over this. This is probably one of the hoppiest beers I have ever tasted.

I am glad I got to try it, but it seems that I prefer both Ruination and Enjoy By over this. I'm surprised out how good Stone is at brewing so many distinct IPAs.

The foam subsided slowly and left a good thick quarter-inch layer that provided a beautiful lace to the end. The aroma was flower, citrusy, and pretty sweet, with some fresh-baked bread notes. Mild tropical fruit, pineapple and resiny pine also came forward.  The taste is just like the aroma, with big citrus and tropical fruits, pine and some sweet bready malt. What an excellently balanced brew! Overall, RuinTen is one of my favorite Stone brews. Although this beer is already a couple of months old, the hops seemed to hold up really well.

Some understated caramel sweetness appears as the beer warms. This is a big IPA. Although it is primarily medium-bodied with an oily, resinous character at first, the beer does begin to feel heavy.

Great turns to good as I struggle to finish the 22 oz bomber. Hops truly overpower any trace of a malt backbone. At near 11%abv it is not disguised and hits you in the face at the halfway point both in feel and in taste. Have to knock it down 1/2 a point for tasting the booziness of the beer. Otherwise an outstanding offering any hopheads should experience.","Jekyll","Jun 24, 2013"

It's excellent, but I'm not quite sure what the point is compared to Stone's usual offerings. Although the hops rock, It's slightly too malty sticky for my tastes, and it is sort of absurdly potent. I'd rather have a couple of Ruinations because I like the mouthfeel better and I would not fall out of my chair..than again the fresh hop taste of Ruin Ten is nice and it's good to get one's ass kicked once in awhile, I suppose.","Cobrito","Jun 24, 2013"

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is very nice, it smells mostly like pine and citrusy (tropical fruit, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some earthy notes and bit of bready malt noticeable too. Of course the lingering finish is good and bitter! Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and a little creamy with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, I'm glad I picked this up earlier today. Definitely worth trying, and I'll be buying this again in the future. $7.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Jun 21, 2013"

Piney hops in your face, lots of hops, boozy aroma as well with some floral aroma in the background. The first sip tastes really syrupy, like someone took a handful of hop cones and squeezed them into my mouth. Really sweet with bitterness after, but not as bitter as I thought it would be. The alcohol is pretty well hidden as well. This is a real heavy hitter, probably the most intense IPA i've had which is not necessary a bad thing - you gotta be in the right mindset to enjoy it.","greenmtn1111","Jun 20, 2013"

Relly pretty dark gold color with a hope varient that isn't common to stone. OK mouth feel with extreme hop notes... Not sure what hop in particular but they put a bunch of this one strand.

It’s not the hoppiest or the most memorable DIPA I’ve had, but all of the most prominent components—hops, malt, and booze—blend in to each other well, which is the mark (to me, anyway) of a well-crafted DIPA. For me, I think I actually prefer the regular Ruination, because it’s a lean, mean, hop-blasting machine, while this is a big, thick DIPA with its own character. But this is plenty good in its own right, too, and worth seeking out if you like DIPAs brash, thick, and balanced.","fmccormi","Jun 17, 2013"

Nose is fruity up front then dominated by resiny full with hints of pine and woodsy grasses. This beer hits the mouth with a tangy champagne bitterness that is wonderfully dry and very crisp. Prickly on the tongue with a long lingering bitterness on the mouthfeel. This brew really defines a great DIPA on the dryer side. This is one I would love to have more of to pair with food. Hopefully they bring this one back as a permanent brew.","SPLITGRIN","Feb 10, 2013"

The taste was fairly frustrating as the nose gets overpowered by the 10.8 ABV. Definately better than standard ruination, but fails to have that wow factor that we search for in the ultimate beer. enjoyable for a hop-head but this will faintly be remembered for nothing more than an over-the-top anniversary release.","djjacobsen","Jan 17, 2013"

The nose is an overload of citrus hops and a bit of pine. From there, it goes downhill. The flavor is indeed quite hoppy and fairly nice, but it’s also fairly boozy, which is an unpleasant sensation when combined with the extreme bitterness. Definite heat there.

3.93,-8.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Pours a dull burnt orange hue with a 2.5 inch cream-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly collapses in on itself. Head eventually settles into a broken, frothy cap with some residual textured clumps of lacing present as the liquid recedes. Clarity is on the murky side. This beer is a malt bomb - I can smell it from two feet away. That said, nose also expresses a slight oniony character, earthiness, citrus and rind (in that order). Big malt presence in the flavor profile. There's a caramel/toffee presence off the bat which is quickly cut by ethanol and earthy/rindy citrus flavors. The onion quality present in the nose comes out again towards the back, but it is much less assertive in the flavor profile. Finish is a combination of sweet and bitter; a nice juxtaposition. Great mouthfeel - medium-bodied with a lively, although not overly assertive, carbonation. There's a slightly oily texture and a light acidity that stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. Overall, I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try this. All of the elements don't necessarily come together for me, but this is a pretty good DIPA. I'd like to see what 2-3 years does to this beer. I definitely think it will take on some barleywine-esque qualities as it matures.","Jwale73","Sep 27, 2012"

Very caramely wrapped up with resinous sticky pine, grapefruit and a hint of orange zest. There is alcohol heat in the stomach but none in the taste. Its definitely "ruination" for the palate. I think its awesome, but I liked it better on tap and I still think the double dry-hopped Ruination blows this out of the water. These extreme palate wrecking DIPAs always leave me a little disappointed because I hate an IPA with this much malt. I know its supposed to be for balance but I thought the whole purpose of a DIPA was hoppiness. Still an awesome brew from Stone though. I prefer their 16th Anniversary.

The aroma was a malty peppery combination, preparing for a hop explosion. In the initial taste, one gets the carmel of the malts before the hops explode. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and a sweet grassy taste "ruin" the palate. The citra hops were easily detectable, often overwhelming the less explosive centennial hops. The malt stays in the background, but gives a nice smooth feeling to the ale. The citrus notes continue in the aftertaste while warming the throat as it goes down. This is a DIPA that some non-IPA drinkers even liked. The bitterness that some dislike in IPAs is hidden by the power of the citra.","JohnnyHopps","Sep 02, 2012"

Admittedly, I think regular Ruination is a little overrated and I didn't like this as much as the regular one. This seemed to almost border on barleywine territory, and you could really tell that it was nearly 11%.

Some resinous pine with some bubblegum backing. The pale malt is there yet is not detracting. At six weeks in, this is a stellar version of an all ready hopped up DIPA. Bright citrus, orange, papaya, grapefruit. The bubblegum is sweet, the malt brings forth sugars balancing stuff out yet not killing the buzz. Bitter, yes, malt backing, yes, delicious, yes. The body is a step above medium ,resinous, piney and large. Carb is there pricking the tounge.

Incredible hop bitterness coats the mouth and lingers. I will be tasting hops for a week or so. Alcohol is almost undetectable. Is there balance here? No, not really.

There's a big caramel malt aroma as well. There is a gigantic hop flavor explosion in the mouth. The piney resin coats the tongue, bringing a large amount of hop bitterness. The citrus flavors come next as do the sweet malts. For the intensity of the hop flavors, this is extremely well-balanced. The alcohol does not come through in the flavor either.

It also comes across as slightly more drinkable than regular Ruination since the extra malt and alcohol helps balance the saturation level of bitterness.

4.42,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A nicely hopped up version of the regular Ruination, with some more alcohol to boot. Drink it fresh! Those lovely hops will fade quickly and you'll lose the fresh herbal notes and resinous qualities of the beer. Right now, you get a blast of citrus and stinky herbs in the nose and then more of the same in the taste with a long bitter finish that is redolent of pine. It's definitely a hop hit, but as big as it is, it's balanced and has a developing flavor profile that runs the range of double IPA flavors. Really well done.","Georgiabeer","Jul 29, 2012"

A moment after removing the cap the intense amount of hops used to brew this beer found my nose a couple feet away within seconds. Needless to say the aroma at closer inspection for fans of hops is nothing short of amazing - fruity, floral, piney. I love hoppy beers but often save them for later in the session. Not so here with this rarity to find on the east coast. I'm enjoying each and every sip. Initially fridge cold this beer tingled the back of my throat and as the beer warms a bit more alcohol is detectable. Awesome beer!!","Oakenator","Jul 29, 2012"

Some earthen notes in the middle, and some sweeter candied fruits. A bit of boozy ethanol towards the end. Mouthfeel is crisp, bitter, full-bodied in terms of flavor yet thin in consistency. Finishes clean with some warming ethanol. Overall, this was a great showcase of the glory of hops, but the amount of ethanol pulling through was a bit of a disappointment.

Fantastic. Aromas of resiny, delicious, fresh hops with a cedar, spicy, and rich blending of characteristics. Solid caramel sweet backbone and citrus blast on the nose, as well. The flavors are amazingly balanced. The hops come flying through, but don't overpower, which is an impressive feat. Citrus characteristics of grapefruit and tangerine are joined by passion fruit, pineapple, and mango to give an entirely tropical fruit feel to accompany the resiny, rich, bitter, and peppery hops presence. Very balanced, and rides a very smooth, slick body. Bitter and slightly astringent aftertaste cleans the palate and dries the mouth, inviting another mouthful. Slightly dry, very bitter finish that dares you to keep drinking. Surprisingly smooth and drinkable for a 10.8% ABV and a hop punch that really delivers drink after drink.","GarthDanielson","Jul 21, 2012"

Getting lots of pine, floral, citrus, some caramel, alcohol and esters. Lots of hops, as you would expect, but there is a substantial malt background that is present. This makes the beer more layered and complex. Alcohol is detected in the taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat moderate, with a great flow of carbonation from bottom to top. It does leave the mouth quite dry. Overall, I was really impressed with the appearance of this beer and of course the hoppiness and the great care that was taken into created a somewhat balanced beer.

Mild sweetness is present on the mid-palate, but is is complemented (and then dominated) by the hoppy flavors. Mildly boozy on the finish with a blend of pleasing bitterness, a moderate alcohol bite and a little toffee, this beer is a riot on the palate. The only other beer that I can think of that is so over the top is the older batches of White Knuckle (circa 2008).

Although the flavor profile is quite similar to many West Coast IPAs of the style, it is amp-ed up thanks to the Citra dry hopping and surprising balance of hop flavor to hop bitterness. The extra ABV malt backbone I believe also contributes to the surprising "balance" and I say balance for those used to hop monsters, not recommenced for a beginner, highly recommended for avid DIPA fans.","claspada","Jul 18, 2012"

I call it fruity more than I call it bitter (I get the bittering now, don't get me wrong). Like a really good hop bomb, sheets of lacing leave a trail after the liquid swirls. The feel is great.

Mouth-feel is full bodied, chewy, syrupy, oily, resiny, finishes bitter but sweet also. Nice balance.

The nose is in your face no doubt, huge dank and citrus combo, piney and floral with strong malt backbone and caramel. The taste just absolutely ruins your palate like I've never experienced. Melons and malt show up quick with just an absurd amount of slick hop oils and a big dry and bitter finish with a warming alcohol presence. Hop resin, caramel malt, orange peel, heat, boom. This is the biggest and most aggressive dipa I've experienced hands down. It's like a triple rainbow.... The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied and i would say this is not an easy drinker.

Smell is super hoppy (obviously) with citrus zest, herbal hops, and some of the dreaded onion-like hop aromas which I wasn't expecting. Taste is actually quite sweet with citrus fruit, citrus zest, herbal hops, and some malt in there too. A slight onion flavor starts to emerge as the beer warms. The bitterness on the finish is actually pretty tame and starts to fade somewhat quickly after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that I think tastes better than it smells.

Citra everywhere. Centennial everywhere. Unfortunately there is plenty of alcohol but the ridiculous hop levels are welcome. The longer I sip this beer I get a trace of onion in the aftertaste. That and the alcohol are the only turn offs I see. This is a quality DIPA, yet perhaps overdone. I wonder what it would be like if it was 100% Citra, but who wouldn't?

You can certainly pick out the citra hops, also some pine, and fruit. Does not punch you in the nose, but fair. Well it is certainly bitter. Loads of hops, pithy bitterness, citrusy, and pine.

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I have always been a big fan of the regular version, so when I saw this one, I HAD to try it. It definitely did not disappoint. For them to have raised the bar on an already great brew, I have to give them a lot of credit for that. The alcohol is NOWHERE to be found on this one which is quite scary as easy as this was to down. A definite must try from Stone if you have not done so already.

Hell, it's drinks very different from Ruination, which is awesomely bitter but rather low gravity compared to many of today's DIPAs. But this beer, like slim few others I have had recently, pulls off HUGE without making a mess of itself. It doesn't taste like pumpkin or willow bark. It's not cloying.

It's a lot better than regular Ruination in my opinion.

Many have tried to push the IPA past the 10% mark and have ended up with an overly resinous and cloying mess. While I have never had Exponential Hoppiness, this is the best extreme IPA I've ever had. It is a hop bomb, yet there is actually so much more to the beer. The malt and alcohol come together and really put a level of balance that I have yet to see.

I say water, because I'm pretty sure this bomber just ruined my balance and reaction time as well. This beer was refreshing and fruity to begin with. It was a little resinous and thick towards the end. This is aggressive. I mean, it's Stone Brewery. One should expect it. Stone's aggressive nature is why I like them. Their aggressively hopped beers in regular rotation are great. It's the special one-off beers that tend to knock me off balance. This is really good, but not great.

4.12,-4.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear, golden copper color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is extremely hoppy (what would you expect from a Ruination on steroids?). Lovely hops with a good amount of malt and pine sap. Very piney with faint citrus. Taste is initially like biting into a pine cone that is glazed with honey. A good amount of malt in this one...a little too much unfortunately. Still keeps that west coast hoppy flavor though. Hop resin bitter grapefruit and a hint of pineapple. Heavy malt richness in the finish...a bit of booze as well. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a surprising creaminess to it. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer, but I wish it didn't turn out as malty as it did. Becomes a little much as you continue to drink the bottle.","DovaliHops","Jun 22, 2012"

Good malt, good hop, big flavor and good drinking. This is a limited-time release, so if you love Ruination or DIPA's, this is definitely worth a try.","DM1293","Jun 19, 2012"

The nose is Citra dominated hops, so intense and gorgeous. The taste profile slides in in perfect unison, citrus fruits, mango, and pineapple dominate. The mouth is a balancing act of sweet malting and uber bitter hopping, 110 IBU that is so well balanced it's amazing.

Aroma is not nearly as potent as I was expecting, but what is there is orange juice, orange blossom, and pine. Flavor starts off with a good dose of pale malt and then turns sweet and hoppy with notes of orange and citrus and bit earthy on the finish. Alcohol is well hidden for nearly 11%. Moderate to aggressive bitterness, but again not as potent as I was expecting. Overall, and enjoyable beer, but was expecting a bit more hop character, both in the nose and the bitterness.","Florida9","Jun 16, 2012"

If I'd had one cold 8oz pour on draft at Stone I'd rate this higher than I did, but a full bomber with adequate warming shows me this is a pretty solid beer but overly malty and alcoholic while lacking the bright hop expression I find in fresh Ruination.
