"Purchased a 5 day old 4 pack of 12 oz bottles. Thoroughly enjoyed!"
"O: Big bitterness balances big malt to produce a wonderful evening brew."

"Delicious IPA!  They're dated, and I'd suggest getting them as fresh as possible, but these are beers to be bought when you see them.  Perfect carbonation, color and smell.  I'm a big fan."
"One of my favorites. Great double"

"I must have gotten a bad batch. This stuff tasted like alcohol and not the good kind. One of very few beers I've drank and didn't enjoy (and I've had a lot). Pretty disappointed about thing especially because i paid $17 for a 4 pack. the bottled on date is only a month back so its definitely not the freshness."
"One of the best double IPA's in the world, year round release, easy to find, what more do you want??"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is better than most.  And priced pretty well too."

"Tropical, grapefruit with a solid hop bite...very smooth and drinkable"

"This beer definitely drinks like a 9.5%'er. Not a bad thing, but sometimes breweries do a good job of covering a high abv by adding this & that. Not this one. This beer has a big, piney, in-your-face taste that is all that an IPA should be. That being said, nothing really stood out to me as incredible. This beer is good, but I had to go the online route to acquire it, and while it IS good, I don't think I'll be buying it again anytime soon. If it were available to me locally, then yeah."

"Too sweet, not enough hops"
""
""
""
"My favorite DIPA to date. Just the right amount of malt (not too sweet or cloying) and big, juicy citrus flavor, mostly grapefruit but some papaya or mango too."
""
""
"Awesome overall dipa.  Hoppy but not cloying.  Tasted great but didnt destroy the steak and potatoe."
""
"O - My favorite DIPA and one of the best beers you can get year round"
""
""
""
""
"damn good!! Go to beer"
"Overall, nearly perfect IPA.  Must-try. Would be hard-pressed to pick between this and The Calling, from Boulevard. So I'll take them both :)"
""
""
"Quite possibly one of the best IPA's or DIPA's I have had.  The is nice beer that pours a nice golden color and had a nice white creamy head to it.  The aroma of sweet hops fills the glass.  The taste is smooth and hoppy and a bit sweet and the 9.5% ABV can only be detected by the warming sensation in your belly.  The mouthfeel is super smooth for an IPA.  It is a really great beer!  Can't say enough about this.  I have had many of the Firestone Walker beers, this may be my new favorite!"
"Good IPA, but not my favorite."
"O-  one of my favorite DIPAs!  Especially the whole 4 pack thing."
"I just wish it was a little bit more bitter. Other than that, this thing is pure perfection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious with smoked salmon dip"
"This is a stand-out IPA.  Drank it from a snifter at The Gallows in South End.  Bright, fresh citrus, with a big punchy hop bite.  Drink it when you find it, and search it out if you can."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not biggest double IPA guy but my friend suggested this one and it's been one of my favorites ever since..not too hopped and full of flavor...somehow the high alcohol content is masked beautifully"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really smooth, creamy mouth feel. Great amber color. Great DIPA"
"A nice change up from the quads i drink very smooth and love that hoppy taste. A great beer all around"
""
""
""
""
""
"From a 22oz bottle. Light hop aroma with a bit of fruit (tangerine) and prominent malty background. Pours clear medium dark golden amber with 1""" off-white head that lingers and leaves lots of lacing. Very clean tasting. Lots of hop bitterness is balanced excellently with the caramel malt flavor. Because of it’s hop/malt balance and ability to hide it’s 9.5% ABV, this is a very drinkable DIPA. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"The """chewiness""" of the Double Jack almost reminds me of tropical gushers- that sweet, syrupy residue taste it leaves on your gums. My favorite part about this beer is how the honey/gusher residue pushes the bitterness out of the way on the backend. That, coupled with the pungent floral smell is what makes this beer so great."
""
"Overall, not a bad DIPA it gets better as the alcohol warmth hits after a few sips. The mango taste is very apparent and definitely adds to the beer."
""
""
""
"Would purchase again."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Color is a sort of golden brown, with very little head forming. Aroma is hop, and I don't catch too much else. The taste is a sort of malty vanilla that is a tiny bit sweet and becomes more tasty as it goes on. Its body is firm and it finishes the same. Absolutely solid DIPA."
""
""
""
"In my opinion the best readily available Imperial IPA around."
""
"Overall- An outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Just brilliant.  Hits the nail on the head for the flavor I want in a DIPA.  Its chock full of flavor without a crazy bitterness to overwhelm.  Very bright in flavor and dry in its finish."
"Overall- Great change of pace DIPA. Not what I usually reach for due to price constraints, but this beer is the real deal."
""
""
""
"From 22oz bomber with bottled on date of 3/15/13. Citrus and melon nose with a little bread. Good bitter/malt balance."
"O - Big piney hops mixed with juicy tropical flavors make this a top shelf DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When Jesus wept, this is what his tears tasted like..."
""
""
"Overall, this is a DIPA I'd revisit regularly if it were available in my distro area, though I think we do the hoppy game much better out here in Ohio. Great nose, and pretty tasty."
""
""
""
""
"2/12...pours bright gold orange, light on the bottom and opaque at top. Foaming white lid about 1/4 inch. Bright bitter, sunny, citrus. Heavy hearty wall of deep malt  bitter. Boozy and then some. Mellows with time."
""
"Nothing great and nothing bad.  Overall disappointing.  Just an average iipa"
""
""
"Best IPA I have ever had, ok one of the best!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Two finger head. Smell is hopsational. The initial taste is hoppy with just enough backbone. This is kind of like pure hoppiness but less sweet are more alcohol taste."
"The fact is that you will rarely find this beer fresh, and it's not worth the price usually. But always check, and if you do find that fresh bottle, buy it immediately and proceed to drink one of the better DIPA on the market today."

""

"Beautiful one finger head sitting on an auburn base.  Nose is piney hops.  Taste has a touch of sweetness.  Great bitter finish.  Didn't think it was in your face as much as some DIPAs.  Nice balance.  Excellent."
""
""
"Beautiful orange color - amazing smell - wow!  Sweet hops on the nose are outstanding.  Taste is dry hopped honey flavor and feel is great, but a bit of alcohol on the finish.  Outstanding beer that I will revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice deep orange glow with a thick fluffy white head and nice thick lacing.  Muted tropical and orange aromas and a sweet malty and slightly boozy backbone.  Taste follows, and this is where I think the age hurts it, sweet malty body all the way through with some muted orange citrus and tropical flavors through the middle with a bitter finish.  Medium body, smooth carbonation and a sticky feel.  Overall this is good, Good enough I'm gonna look for it fresher to see if it's great."

"Double Jack - Firestone Walker Brewing Company - Paso Robles, California - Imperial/Double IPA - 9.5% ABV - Now this is what I call a solid DIPA. It poured a crimson gold color with an off-white head that leaves excellent lacing on the glass. The nose featured aromas of oranges, lemon, dank citrus hops, and hints of strong pine. The mouth has a medium-plus feel with a velvety finish, accompanied by flavors of citrus, pineapple, pine, and pale malt sweetness - which makes this brew a cohesive winner. This is definitely a classic DIPA in my books. Pick one up next time you see one, you won't be disappointed. 95/100 @firestonewalker"

"12oz bottle poured into snifter. Copper in color with a little crown that settled quickly. Not much lacing. Very clear with scattered carbonation bubbles swimming to the top. Citrus hop aroma; no alcohol present in the scent. Resiny feel, very light and smooth for a DIPA.  Very hoppy but I ocasionally pick up a fruity sweetness. A hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. The more I consumed the more I liked it. Very well done. Much more refined than most DIPAs. One of my favorites. (9.0)"

"This is in my top 2 of Imp IPA'S. My awesome wife got me a log of it for father day last yr. Best gift ever!"
""
"One of my favorite Imp. IPAs! I love FW so much for all of the wonderful things they do. Their barrel brews are just simply amazing!"

"One of the best IIPA going ."
"Fantastic citrus taste and well balanced beer"

"Nice citrus ness with a pleasant dry finish for this double ipa"
""
""
""
"V - Single bomber. Well worth the price."
""
""
""
""
"A strong IPA taste, but what else could I expect from a double jack?  Nice bitterness, cool color, but a heavy taste and feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice trick - solid balance, with flashy hops and strong malt backbone that keeps the bitterness mild, but without tumbling into a syrupy mess."
""
""
""
"Very balanced. Not the crazy citrus hop explosion of others doubles lately. VERY drinkable. Loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Would have to be one of or if not the best IPA's I have had. Love the slight sweetness it has that is balanced perfectly with a little tangy bitter finish. A absolute must try!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic DIPA, which hits all the notes for me. Pours with a deep white head that kicks up. A remarkable balance here between the fruitiness of the hops and the dryness which elevates this above many other double IPAs that I have enjoyed. Crisp, along with the dry aspect. Allows the hops to shine through, with just a sweet undercurrent to add to the balance."
"Strange taste and musty unpleasant smell. Probably would not drink again."
""
""
""
"Very solid IPA, i enjoy Union Jack better by them"
"One of my fav DIPAS. not too sweet. I prefer that in a DIPA. Nice balance with hop finish n not sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just ok.  Expected more based on prior reviews.  Would much rather have a stone face ipa or a 90 min dogfish.  Not terrible, but won't go out of my way to get it again."
""
""
""

"nice and thick on the tongue...."
""
""
""
""
"This was a really good double ipa! Looks awesome in the glass.. Smells just as it should! And taste is outstanding! Will definitely buy again!! Well well made beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a first rate DIPA, as I've come to expect from Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite IPAs."
"Overall:  this is a damn fine IIPA, but it doesn't completely blow me away.  Still, I could see drinking this quite regularly."
"Has to be far my favorite IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is great beer when it's drank fresh.  I've noticed a few different FW IPAs fall off pretty quick with time and this can be one if them.  Fresh it's delicious, but after a couple months this becomes a malt bomb."
"Taste: Strong, with plenty of bitter citrus and pine hops. A little bitter and warm at the finish, but overall this is an exceptionally well-balanced imperial IPA, as the malts keep this heavy-handed triple-dry-hopped brew in check. Would love to try one fresher (maybe one day Firestone Walker will distribute to Indiana)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a honey orange with a 2 finger thick white foam head.  Smells of orange blossom, citrus, light pine.  Sweet orange and pine, sweet malts.  Medium/light carbonation, aftertaste of sweet and spicy pine.  Outstanding beer from beginning to end."
""

"Gray stuff. Drinks well"

"I am a big fan of double IPAs, but I was not a big fan of this beer. Surprisingly, Firestone Walker managed to outpace the considerable malt bill with an extreme hop bitterness that made me think of a slightly rotten lemon sitting in a dank basement. That's too far, of course, but compared to other double IPAs I have enjoyed, this was not even in the top twenty. Perhaps it has to do with the attenuation of the yeast, but there was not enough malt sweetness to counterbalance the hops in this monster."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an astonishingly balanced double IPA.  If I drank this completely blind, I would never think it was a double - there's very little heat to it, and the hops are assertive without destroying the palate.  There's a characteristic freshness to everything Firestone Walker does, and it really comes through in this beer."
""
""
"Bottle is quite a few months old, that's why it probably seems lacking that final extra hoppy kick. It's still plenty hoppy, but there's a small empty spot there that needs filling. Rated keeping that in mind."

"Overall: Very impressed with Double Jack, not a big bitterness for a double IPA, it's about 6 weeks old from the bottle date, but a very juicy double IPA, nice balance of bitterness and malt. What I like most about this beer is that it's not sweet for a double IPA. A lot of double IPA I have tasted are really sweet on the back end of the palate, this one isn't, definitely a go to, going to have to buy a four pack next time, cheers!"
""
""
""
"overall a damn good beer, great 2 finger head, great pure gold color, nice lacing down the glass, great aroma of citrus and tropical fruits and that bitterness of the hops smacks you in the nostrils as well. taste is super refreshing and makes you want to drink more"

"O – I really like that the malt provides a backbone for this highly hopped beer.  I know I’m drinking an Imperial IPA, but I don’t feel like I’m getting bludgeoned."

""

"Decent nose with typical barrel aged sweetness and citrus.  Tasted raisin, caramel, honey and a very slight hint of butterscotch.  Finished clean, no bitterness or """boozy""" after taste."
""
""
""
"Phenomenal beer! Close to a 90 minute from Dogfish Head.  Worth it if you see it!"

"Pours with a thick white head, that leaves tons of lace on the side. Golden and clear.  Pine and spruce notes, with caramel.  Strong bitter flavor with a sweeter tone on finish.  Full-bodied with some heat from the alcohol and a decent amount of carbonation.  Lots of fun in the bottle, but I be the fresher draft version is even better."

"0: Even with a beer that was well past its suggested date of consumption, I was left impressed. Great flavor, great aroma profile, very easy to judge, easy to enjoy, didn't melt my face off, just a well crafted beer. I can't wait to try more offerings from FSW, and to get my hands on a fresh Double Jack."

""
"Light amber in color with an off white head.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is full of citrus hops is somewhat detectable.  This bottle is 5 and a half months old.  The citrus hop flavor is sharp and moderately carbonated.  While it is acutely bitter,the light malt backbone really does a great job of evening things out."
""
"Light in color, extra dry finish. Has a certain after taste I cannot describe. Not bad for a double. Good beer!"

"Orange and hazy, with a thick head that slowly sinks, but lacing sticks throughout. Tastes...Oh, this has been reviewed a billion times, so no need to continue. Just a delicious DIPA that perfectly encapsulates the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden straw pour with a thin head. The nose and flavor pallet are similar. Pineapple, tropical fruit, a little lemon, and a mild bitter finish. Well masked alcohol for a double. Well crafted.  Will revisit."

""
""
""
"OVERALL: This Double IPA Wakes-Up the ENTIRE Mouth then Runs Out the Back Door Leaving you """HIGH & DRY""" and Wondering WHAT Just Happened? Thankfully You can Always take another sip and Re-Live the Entire Pallet Pleasing Experience.  I Definitely Recommend This Great IPA by FIRESTONE WALKER!"

"Deep golden amber with minimal fluffy head that leaves quickly with very nice lacing. Aroma is hoppy with lots of grapefruit!. Taste is hoppy, citrus, bold, yet not overpowering. Definitely getting grapefruit in this brew and I like it. Mouthfeel is nice and the high ABV is covered well with hardly any, if any, alcohol burn. A nicely balanced beer."

"O - Never a bad brew from FSW, this is an excellent DIPA, but not a leader of the category like Union Jack for IPA's."
"Overall, this is one of the best double IPAs.  I had found this in a local shop that got in several new double IPAs all at the same time, many of which I had never tried and some of which I had been looking for.  Out of all of the excellent double IPAs I had during this time period, Firestone Walker's Double Jack was the best of the bunch."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Huge aroma just from the pour. Clear gold in color. No haze, perfectly filtered. A nice foamy white head that lasts a while. Like I said, huge aroma. Tons of pine, mango, and citrus. Maybe a little alcohol. Taste follows the nose with a nice malt backbone. This is a perfectly balanced DIPA. Alcohol barely makes its presence known. There's no way to tell this is a 9.5% beer until you're halfway done and already feeling buzzed. Mouthfeel is a little thick, but still amazing for a DIPA. Overall, unbelievable. I had this about a year ago and loved it, but coming back I love it even more. This is probably the most overlooked DIPA of the west coast and rivals the likes of Pliny, Sucks, and Enjoy By, and is more readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured with small white head and a hazy light orange body. Pine, earthy aroma. Kind of like walking through the woods. Sweet caramel taste, with a big punch of bitter hops. Slightly sour on the side of the tongue. It’s good, but I like regular Union Jack IPA more."
""
""
""
""
"Pours gold orange with a medium off white head. Aroma is of citrus pine hops, yeast and sweet caramel notes. Taste same as aroma with citrus, grapefruit notes up front followed by caramel malt, brown sugar, resin and yeast notes. Palate is a full body, mild carbonation, sweet and smooth mouth feel. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt, yeast flavor and some good moderate citrus grapefruit hops bitterness on the end for balance. A very good well made full flavored and tasty."

"I might just put this in my IPA top 5. Very nice."
"A cracking DIPA, this is the only one I've had from the US where the malt flavour packs as big a punch as the hops. Early on the hops smell is a little overpowering until the malt comes through to join it, and the resulting taste is a wonderful blend of caramel malt and tropical fruits, mainly pineapple. Extremely well balanced, easy to drink, and has something that appeals to the English ale drinker in me."

"My favorite beer above all! I wish I could get this in Texas!   It starts with a wonderful a tropical fruit, watermelon, lemons, oranges and mango and a hit of grapefruit. The middle is a sweet and a slight malty flavor, with honey and caramel. It ends a little bitter and dry. The way it should."

"Overall: Hoppy goodness for sure. This brew sets juicy hop flavors to the front. Enough malt to entertain the hops on the palate. The alcohol is only present in the aroma, so this ale could get you in trouble. The modest bitterness is refreshing for a big beer like this. Is this an earthshattering DIPA? No, yet it holds it’s own in the West Coast Style. Recommended."

"This poured with a clean copper hue and a thin layer of bubbles so at first glance I was barely impressed. I then took in an intense aroma of tropical fruit, oranges, watermelon and slight grapefruit. The scent takes on even more characteristics of floral dankness, sweet caramel and bitter Lupilin. It was then no surprise that this  has an intense and pungent flavor. It starts amazingly fruity with tropical fruit punch, watermelon, lemon, oranges and mango. The middle is sweet, lightly malty, with honey and caramel. It ends bitter and dry. FW lives up to the hype."

"Nice hazy orange! Could smell from across the room when the bottle was opened. Lots of hops, some citrus. The taste followed the smell plus a little sweetness so it was smooth and easy to drink. All in all a solid DIPA."

"Overall: Overall this is another great Double IPA! This is my first beer from Firestone and I'm quite impressed. I'll be needing to pick up a few more of their beers next time I'm at the store. I was a little hesitant going into these Double IPAs thinking they might annihilate my palate, but so far they have been awesome! Slowly becoming more and more of a fan."

"Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable - alcohol well hidden. Good as a sipping and savoring beer, but I think it would be good with a meal as well, but something this notable in flavor might be hard to pair with so the nice flavors of this beer don't get lost. While expensive, this beer is worth it, and I think I need to try this one again either fresh on tap or with an earlier bottling to see if I can capture even more of the hop aroma that this beer has in abundance."

"Just sampled for the first time and must say, one of the very best ipa's I've ever had! There are some subtle flavors on the front end but drinks smooth for a beer with 9.5%. Everybody has their favorites but, IMO, this deserved the great reviews its gotten. It's probably the most expensive 4-pack I've bought, but it drinks like a champ so its worth the extra $$."

"Poured from a bottle into a goblet. Color is a lovely hazy honey gold. The head is thin, but nice lacing. Aroma is deep and rich with floral hops and a bit of pine. The grapefruit nose comes out if you let it warm up a bit. Flavor is delicious malt, floral hops, and a little caramel. This is a well balanced ale with delightful bitterness--not too much. Mouth feel is medium, with a little creaminess. Overall the is an outstanding ale, thoroughly enjoyable."

"Was so excited to open this from a recent shipment of west coast offerings that I received. It pours a orange copper hue with a small white head that leaves decent lacing and film and has beautiful slick legs. The nose is hoppy with lots of pine, floral, and grapefruit notes as well as a nice malty presence. Very balanced and fresh smelling. The mouthfeel is super smooth and very pleasantly sticky. Carbonation level is just right. The flavor is an incredible balance of fresh west coast hops and malt sweetness. Nicely bitter but very balanced and easy to drink. Abv is almost completely hidden. This is one of the finest dipas that I have ever had. Hope to get some more down the road. Well done!"

"This is a pretty good beer. I think Firestone in general produces great beers. Think one has your typical IPA type hoppy smell and taste. Not that it's generic but it just didn't stand out as much as i thought it would. I still put the Wookey Jack over it.. Still with that being said Thumbs up."
""
"Pours a crisp amber color with moderate head and lacing. Aroma has strong pine and citrus. Taste starts with lemon and piney hops, and moves into a nice malt presence with notes of caramel, honey, and sage. One of the smoother mouthfeels for a DIPA.."
"This is damn nearly perfection in a glass. Pours a clear golden body with decent white head and pretty/steady stream of bubbles casting themselves upward. Aromas are very complex, encompassing everything from tropical fruit to floral to grassy to caramel to honey. Taste is sweet and caramel-like upfront, before yielding to pineapple fruit and bubblegum, with a good amount of yeast and florals here and there. F inishes like a compost pile of grass clippings and day-old orange peels. Nicely carbonated body keeps it all alive and aloft. This beer is a seriously happenin' one and done."

"O: I am getting only one note - bitter. I was hoping for something that hit on multiple flavors and notes. There is no bitter aftertaste - which is a plus. I don't think I would repeat this one."
"O: A very good and easy to obtain IPA. It's rated highly for a reason. If you haven't tried it yet and like IPAs, go get some."

"Simply the best double IPA you will ever have. MASSIVE candied fruits. Think those dried pineapples that are chewy and delicious. Orange, tangerine. Sweet grapefruit. Hop bitterness in my opinion is more reserved than its union jack younger brother, but still a nice hit of hops. This beer is absolutely fantastic."
"Overall, excellent beer. Love the heat that comes in at the end very nice little burn. Much more balanced than other Dbl IPAs. This was bottled on 10-25-13 would love to taste a fresh one."

"Dried apricot & tangerine in color and aroma complimented with freshly picked Plumeria and Freesia blossom. Bitterness at first glance that is gorgeously balanced with crystal malts that soften an expected sharp mouth feel all the better to lead you onto a tangy citrus and sun ripened pineapple ride of summertime goodness. Has a mouth watering finish that is irresistible. Seriously Borderline perfect!!!"
""
""
""
""
"O this is big and robust, but the higher alcohol content stands out and mutes some of the flavor. Single jack is I think more balanced. 4.25"

"Nice double ipa. Nice and Fruity taste and smell. Grapefruit is very overpowering but in a refreshing way. Like a very fine wine this is a classical combination with just enough zest and peel but not overpowering. Would buy again as a spring and summer beer."

"Poured into tulip glass from 12 oz bottle (stamped 3/5/14). Clear golden honey color with a finger of off-white head which was a bit soapy looking with minimal lacing. Smell is of sharp citrus (grapefruit), piney resin and alcohol. Taste is sharp bitter hops, some floral notes, a malt backbone and a warming alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky with moderate carbonation and coats the tongue quickly. The finish is bitter and dry, reminding me of very dry white wine. The alcohol was initially a bit too pronounced for my liking. About halfway through the glass my palette got used to this beer and I enjoyed its characteristics more."

""
""
""
""
"Review #2: So my parents don't drink alcohol. I tried getting them into craft beers with the notion of, drink not to get drunk, but just to taste the goodness. So they did, and I started with the double jack, and they were convinced at first sip that they want to learn more about beers. Firestone, I love you."

"Enjoyed out of the bottle. It poured exceptionally clear, especially for a double, a light butterscotch color. The nose is sweet and malty. The bitterness comes thru in the first sip, with a bit of funk. The taste was malty - sweet with some alcohol burn. Overall, there are more complex doubles out there, I'd say this is OK, but maybe not unique enough to be outstanding."

"7 BA's attending a beer tasting that I hosted in my man cave pub gave this beer an average rating of 4.00. It ranked 5th out of the 8 Firestone beers we tasted. The group of 7 were divided evenly, 2 that favored IPA's, 2 that favored belgians, and 3 that favored Stouts. It actually scored highest with one taster, and low with two other tasters. Unfortunately this beer was too old to properly judge. It should have been a lot fresher in all fairness."

"O: a good double but sweet for a West Coast brew, reviewed from notes taken on 3/6/14"
"Fresh ripe citrus bursts with the first sip. The mouth is painted with distinct resin like bitterness that really lingers. Alcohol is slightly noticeable at this point. Bitterness turns a bit more prickly as you continue to drink. Dryness really builds with each sip. This is a wonderful DIPA. Just classic."

"the type of beer that I must have again. luckily it is around jersey and pretty fresh! probly one of my new top dipa's. has a lot of subtle complexities, not sure where they hid those hops, they're coming out in the most elegant ways, and it just goes down like nothin"

""
""
"O: Damn. This is a good beer. A contender for Pliny, say I. It's a new standard for me. Beers like this make you want to review with poetry. No joke. It's dimensional and mobile, dynamic and volatile. The malt literally feels like rhythm and supporting chords beneath a hoppy melody. Seriously."

"Just had this on-tap at Bilbo Baggins on Queen Street in Alexandria, VA and it was, strangely, the second best beer of the day. My best of the day was Bourbon County Barleywine and this came in a close second. Even though I never heard of this before, the rating refelcetd in their menu was like a challenge; I had to try it. BLUF: It was every bit as good as the near-perfect rating it had; it was nice to see, felt wonderful and tasted like a fresh Sculpin should. This really was a great day for drinking..."

"I've had Heady Topper. I like this better. This beer is more balanced than HT. Until you feel it, you have no idea this beer is so strong. The tremendous hop aroma (grapefruit and pine dominate) is balanced perfectly with the light malty foundation and the strong alcohol. This beer leaves you wanting another and another...until you realize just how strong it is. Best beer I've ever had."
""

"Overall, a really good IIPA but I would stop short of saying it is amazing. My bottle is over three months old so I really would like to try this fresh. The hops have lost some of their luster."

"O- A fantastic DIPA that I can't believe is available year round. Sure we have our share of things  in the MidWest, but not a year round DIPA like this. The only year round DIPA offering like this one we get is Hop Stoopid which funny enough reminds me of this one in flavor. I guess if I could criticize this one I'd have to say that it's a bit too bitter for what I desire in a DIPA but I know this is a West Coast beer so I expect it."

Really nice array of hop flavors throughout this, but the malt can be a bit too dry in the finish at times, almost to the point of astringency. Not quite a world class beer for me, but its definitely great and well worth future purchases."

"Pours a crystal clear topaz color with a thin off-white head. The smell is unique and beautiful: tropical flowers, mango and bubble gum. The taste is quite different from the bouquet: piney hops, very little booze considering the high gravity. Light to medium body. I don't know how they managed such a quaffable double! And very interesting difference between the bouquet and the flavor. Well done, gentleman!"

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a soft, foamy (1/3) and smooth (2/3) mouthfeel. Ethanol felt readily on the back of the throat and palate, but less so as warmth in the nostrils (though this is still present as well). Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"O: Very nice DIPA. Well constructed. Very drinkable and inviting. An excellent quality beer."

"Don't let the look of this beer fool you! The color is very light compared to other Double IPA's, but this beer holds it's own against other IPA's. Carbonation is high, smell is nice and this beer goes down well. It's a nice beer for someone who is scared off by dark beers. If you have never tried this beer, give it a try you won't be disappointed."

"This is an AWESOME double IPA. Hop heavenly!"

"This was my first time having Double Jack, and I'm not going to lie, I was hoping for a little bit more. It's definitely a good DIPA, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype that I've heard and read about over the years, in my opinion. That being said, it's still good stuff."
"O- Yep, impressed. Its hard to find a truly complex IPA. I thought this was one of them. The aroma was layered beautifully, and the flavors were nicely balanced despite all the different things going on. It went from truly super sweet to truly super bitter. The aroma, flavors, and mouthfeel played together wonderfully, offering almost everything a hop-head like me looks for. This one was a roller coaster ride. A+"

"You gotta be kidding me 9.5 ACL? This IPA pours bright amber...then settles into a dark honey hue. Head never dies..lacing ...a Picasso sketch of clouds on a clear horizon. Aroma subdued...nostrils open pulling the head close to a snort...still the fragrance remains a mystery. Taste full of the brewers art....fruit maybe grapefruit...that kind of freshness...finishes in a WOW moment..can this be this good? Complex in a small way...keep it coming....can that bottle be almost empty? If you don't like this beer try tea....Cheers"

"O - Double Jack speaks true to Firestone's motto of """we are living beer""". It may not be the best IIPA out there, but it should be in the mix when talking about the top contenders. Prost!"
"O: This really isn't bad. But even for being two months old, it should have been better. This tells me A) it falls off a cliff almost immediately, or B) it's frankly overhyped. If I buy this again (you know I will, because hype), it better be less than a month old. It's definitely approachable enough for beginners, though - still, I'd much rather have Union Jack any day of the week."

"Overall, this is an utterly incredible DIPA beverage. It took me a while to get into the hoppy drinks, but I feel like if I'd had something of this caliber off the bat I would have gone nuts over it immediately. The main thing holding me back originally was the bitterness, and this one totally nails it. Founders Double Trouble hit the same notes for me; this one is just on a slightly higher level. Amazing!!!"
""
"O- overall a very nice DIPA. It hides the abv very well and drinks like a normal IPA, so be careful lol. This was my first ever Firestone walker and i was not disappointed. This is a perfectly well balanced DIPA and pure enjoyment to try, thank god I have 3 more!"

"Having this again, this beer really blows me away after having it the first time in the beginning of the year and having it again towards the end of the year, I’m impressed it lives up as one of the best IPAs around.

"O-The taste wins. The flavor and overall smoothness make Double Jack a top shelf DIPA. Flavor shape-shifts a bit even as it warms, retaining the character but inviting your palate to discern new and previously unknown taste traits. 9.5% ABV is barely perceptible. Sneaks up on you nicely. Try to keep a bomber in the home at all times. Go Firestone!"

"O: I really like this beer. I recommend it and it wasn't for the high alcohol; I would have it frequently. That being said, it is very drinkable and it left me wanting more."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid, well-made take on the style. Would love to try it a little fresher, but I'll never complain about a beer that holds up quite well for five months. Does a decent job of hiding the high-caliber ABV to boot. Would definitely drink again."

"Overall: An amazing double IPA. This might be one of my new go-to's, with an awesome blend of bitterness, hops and citrus. I highly recommend it."

"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Poured nice orange yellow with a nice fluffy white head. Smells of cirtis with nice flowery and piney tones. Tastes of nice citrus and piney hops, very nice. Beer is medium bodied with a little syrupy consistency but goes down great with good carbonation. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
"Wow! Sniff the bottle. Aromas of fruit - mostly peach to me - are clearly noticeable. Pours to a nigh two finger head. Clear but darker amber color than you would expect. Sniff the bottle again and the fruit aromas are stronger and linger while you savor your beer. Doesn't have the metallic bite that i often experience with IPAs. Fills your mouth without draining it of saliva. Almost dessert like. Not heavy or filling though. Powerful. Little to no after taste. Went well with some a crab cake sandwich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a very quaffable and pleasing IIPA. It won't win any contests for originality, but it hits the mark for a West Coast IIPA with mild bitterness, juicy hops, and a sweeter malt profile. The lighter-than-average feel is probably the highlight for me and the looks are nice, too, with clingy, oily lacing. I would drink this again in a heartbeat, but it is not a world-beater."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. The aroma is incredibly strong, and you can smell the sweet citrus and pine sap without even holding the glass near your face. You start to think that the flavor cannot possible live up the promise that the aroma has made. But it does, to an extent. It's not EXACTLY the flavor that the nose indicated (that would be unfair), but it's damn close. It's almost sticky on your palate. The flavors are almost thick. It's difficult to describe, but it's unlike any other DIPA I've had. When I compare it to some of the DIPA benchmarks like Pliny and Heady Topper, I start to wonder how this is not mentioned on the same level. Is it because of its availability? Let's put it this way.. If faced with having to sniff out some Pliny or pick this up at a good bottle shop, I'd buy this in a second, and wouldn't miss the Pliny one bit."

"651mL and various examples on tap. Pours a clear amber with a very thin, yellow, dense head with fair retention but sticky, webby, white lace. Aroma is pineapple, fruity/tropical hops, caramel malt, lemon, sweet candies, sweet cherries, passionfruit, incredible amount of fruit juice tropical notes. Taste brings very sticky sweet malt as the base with some serous alcohol presence. Big fruity tropical hops with an oily mouthfeel. No cloying. No newspaper. No nutty, nut skin bitterness. Fairly soft and easy to love. Nice. Pretty solid, fresh, DIPA."

"The Double Jack poured a deep gold with a creamy head and was a beautiful beer. The aroma was full of hop notes with citrus some pine a little dankness too. The taste was straight up hops like an amped up Union Jack. It had a dry bitterness that coated my palate with grapefruit and lemon rind with some caramel underneath. The Double Jack didn’t play around. It was a straight up double IPA and it let you know it."
""
"O: A great double IPA that is true to its style. Deliciously complex and not over powering. Be careful of that abv though. This beauty will easily seduce you and before you know it you are on the floor and missing 60 bucks"

"O - This is a prime example of a west coast hop monster. It is loaded with piney hops, and if it wasn't a couple months old I'm guessing I wouldn't be tasting any malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Oh heck of a double IPA! Great malt and hop contrast will definitely please any hop head! Not the most balanced Double IPA but the hop line up on this one is really well done and leads to a fantastic beer! Also dangerously drinkable for 9.5% found myself blowing through this one before i knew it! Great offering from Firestone Walker!"
""
"O - This is the first beer that I've written a review for in a long time (I wanted to let my palate develop a little further before reviewing again). This is also the first IPA that I've fallen in love with. This should not be anything new as this is an extremely highly rated (and popular) brew. FW IPAs seem to be the only IPAs that 'wow' me."
""

""
""

"O - A great DIPA. Even though they are out of CA, I would consider this more of an East Coast style IPA."
"O - Very tasty, nice, thicker, maltier *feeling* dipa (sweet malts are minimal) really nice slightly bitter, big tropical flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has a full, almost sticky mouth feel, which I like, and is a little warming on the way down due to the relatively high ABV. Overall, I am very impressed with this beer, but, at about 6 months old, I have to wonder how much better it could have been had it been bottled more recently. I do love that fruit like beginning, soft biscuity center and creeping massive bitterness for the climax though. Obviously try this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An incredible DIPA. The hops and malts are balanced incredibly well, and the alcohol is well hidden. You get a DIPA with delicious flavors that doesn't destroy your palate. This beer deserves recognition as one of the best DIPAs out there."

"Had this in a party keg at a park festival. Quite nice. Beautiful red-orange color with a white head. Nice hop aroma. What is notable about this DIPA is the heavy-duty malt backbone of this beer. You don't really get DIPAs with that nice complex maltiness. I loved it, quite a bit of a departure from current trends. Almost a bit veering towards amber colored. FInished well, good malt stickiness to finish. Pleasant alcohol level. Hops were good and American, classic American hop flavors, citrus, pine, resin, grapefruit-overall classic American flavor."

"A: Deep gold to copper in color, crystal clear, thin layer of head around the ring of the glass – 4.50, S: Tons of tropical fruits including mango, bananas and pineapple. I also get quite a bit of melon and grapefruit as well as some bubblegum. A pleasant bready sweetness provides a light brush over the top of the nose, all around a spectacular nose - 4.50, T: Tons of resin and heavily pungent, lots of grapefruit and pith, bitterness is aggressive but is balanced quite well with the sweetness of the caramel malts – 4.25, M: Medium bodied with a mild creaminess and tickle on the tongue from the continuing effervescence – 3.75, D: All around a spectacular beer and great representation of the style – 4.25"

"well worthy of its spot on various lists on BA, something I'd look for when state side and only wish I could get in my neck of the woods"
""

"O - Great beer, worth the price, even at 11.99/4 pack, or rather 2.99 a beer. I have bought this in the past and would buy it again just to have it around when other beer appreciators come over. Bell's Hopslam is better, and Lagunitas Hop Stoopid is a better value, but it's still better than 99% of the beers out there, which is why I regularly buy it."

"This is an absolutely amazing example of a true to form Imperial IPA, but with the added balance and drinkability of all of Firestone's beers. The only thing holding it back from unseating Pliny the Elder and Heady Topper as my favorite Imperial IPAs is that their is slightly too much perceived sweetness on the aroma and that the complexities found within the aroma aren't carried over in taste. Anyway you slice it, this is an incredible, readily available Imperial IPA that is a must try for any hop head."

"Mouth Watering Flower Aroma. Great Hoppy After Taste. This Is Now My Favorite Imperial iPA. I Would Liken The Taste To IthaCa Flower PoweR. The Flower Aroma Was Perfectly BalancEd By A Hoppy, Smooth After Taste. My Brother Who Doesn't Like IPAs Thought It Was Good."

"O: I like it but I want to like it more. This may be me but, IMO, a Double IPA should be very hoppy and very malty. This is hoppy on the nose but both the hops and the malt die way too quickly. It's well put together, and I'd buy and drink again, but it's not quite up to snuff."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grapefruits, hops, strong and flavorful.

"UPDATE 9/25/14: Didn't learn my lesson, bought another single in a mixed six a couple of weeks ago, and it was dated 5/21/14, which makes it four months old now.  This one is resiny tasty and smooth and amazingly well covers 9.5 ABV, but the hops are not bomblike.  Based on this I would lower ratings for look, taste and overall while raising mouthfeel, but given the age on this bottle I don't think it would be fair.  Will be on the hunt for fresher, hopefully less than a month old, before making any such changes."

"Crystal clear apricot colored with an orangey beige firm head that lingers long. Aroma of honey, light brown sugar, and tangerine. Flavors of tangerine, orange rind pith, red grapefruit and pine. Some malt balance, but there is firm bitterness and big hop flavors. Full mouthfeel, bitterness and ABV warm and roughen up the palette, but the beer remains fairly drinkable. Good beer overall."

"Light toasted malt up front. Big hops take over. Juicy mandarin orange and pineapple mix with sweetish candy malt and fill in. Peppery, spicy alcohol and herbal, citrusy hops dominate. Bitterness builds toward the finish. Dries out with warming undercurrents in the finish. Lots of lingering citrus and tropical fruit. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Very nicely done!"

"I was working on my own 10 point scale and gave this an 8.5/10. I tried t have the score on here reflect that."
"O: very good. All I wanted tonight was hops and something refreshing to drink and this delivered in a wonderful way. I'm always slightly put off by the $8 bomber, but never disappointed once I've got it in my possession. I will continue to drink this -- it's one of the best easily obtainable DIPAs out there. It is a little bit one dimensional and is unapologetic about it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."

""

"BUY IT"
""
""

"Double jack I personally love and is one of maybe 3 beers I buy again and again because I'm always trying to drink new stuff. Its the beer I tell Dipa heads to buy and if it wasn't for heady would be my favorite Dipa overall. So delicious it is with perfect hop / alcohol / sweetness for my liking. For the round captain lawrence won the overall appearance and smell but trust me... Double Jack is the most underated beer you'll ever try."
""
""
""
"This was one of the most artful west coast DIPA’s I’ve had. Everything in balance and playing off one another. Bitter like crazy but not offensive. Fruits were so juicy up against the alcohol dryness and hop bitter. Alcohol is a little bit on the palate but it belongs there. You are left with the sweet taste of pine like a gracious afterthought. Smooth, really smooth. Original, strapping, unconfined."

"Poured from a bomber bottled on 8/8/14. Nice two- finger head of fluffy white. Clear, golden brew. Aroma is of pine, grapefruit and other citrus notes. Taste is huge grapefruit and and some malt. Overall, one of the better DIPAs out there, it's a keeper."

"I had to pick up a bomber at my local store. It pours a crystal clear orange color with a filmy off white head and active carbonation. It has a candylike aroma with some floral hops, juicy fruity hop aroma, hints of mango and a caramel backbone. Big flavor, very sweet with caramel and fruit with some pine oil on the finish. Has a heavy-medium body with low carbonation and a dry finish. Very good IIPA, don't know if I'd get it again due to the price though."

"So good. So drinkable. So tasty. One of the best IIPAs out there. Love this one."

"Double Jack pours a crystal clear amber gold with a decent head. The aroma is floral, fruity citrusy hops and sweet malt. The flavor is sweet, pale malt with a huge hop presence. Citrusy and fruity, almost soapy, but really nice. Alcohol is well only betrayed by the sweetness, overall a really nice IIPA."

"Firestone Walker Double Jack: Pretty fine double IPA. Got this as a birthday present, and its a nice one! Peachy color to the body, with a faint haze. The head is thin and fades. Fruity aroma earns big points. But ultimately the flavor rules. Nice apricot sweetness, smooth, and a slight bitter in the aftertaste only. Very good double IPA by any standard. A define must try if you like this type of beer. Good introduction to double IPAs, but do not expect them all to be this good!"

"O: In the modern east coast v west coast battle it won't be the hip hoppers that battle it out, it will be the IPAs. More specifically Dogfishhead 90 v Double jack. In that battle I vote Double Jack by a slight margin. big ups to FW."
""
""
"O: A good beer, but it's missing a second gear to get it to the next level. Might be a lesser batch, too, as I recall having some that were a lot better. Would prefer a Union Jack to this one, though."
""
""
""
"O: I'm new to Firestone Walker and if this is any indication of what they do they might give Dogfish Head and Unibroue some competition in my fridge space."

"O: Great beer. It's super citrusy and drinkable for a DIPA. My only fault with this beer is that it gets a bit harsh and boozy on the back end. Hard to complain though, it is super drinkable and delicious from start to finish."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite of the west coast piney DIPA's. A Luxurious hop bomb! Kudos to Firestone Walker Brewery!!"
""
"O: This is a great, great beer. I'd expect nothing less from a jacked-up version of UJ. I love me some hops and so uber-hopped DIPAs like Palate Wrecker are right in my wheelhouse, but I have to say, the balance of this beer is a wonderful testament to the brewing arts. It fulfills my hop requirements while giving me an even more complex experience."

"Overall, a wonderfuyl beer. Cleansing and refreshing. Not really sessionable, but what the heck...not expected to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A stellar West-coast DIPA, the malt mostly overridden by the big-ass, bitter, sassy hops, and when combined with the trailing, understated ABV, creates the semblance of a more standard hopped-up IPA experience than that of the proclaimed style. Good on 'em for this obfuscation, one that I fear I may be the veritable end of my night, smiling all the way."
""
""
"O- a superbly balanced DIPA, fresh and pungent piney hop notes with just enough sweet malt to balance it out. Another fine beer from Firestone."
""
""
""
"Drinkability – To me this is a bit over-hopped. Good, but not great."
"Absolutely amazing! Pours a beautiful, clear sunrise orange with a two finger width, off-white head that leaves a bit of lacing behind. The smell is great; citrus, grapefruit, orange, lemon, and a slight resin. The taste starts with hop bitterness, citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange, and a piney resin. Another medium body DIPA that's smooth and has a nice bitter finish. This brew is not underrated but sometimes overlooked. It should always be considered with the best DIPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very enjoyable DIPA. The juiciness was probably the best quality. There didn’t seem to be much balance between the fruity sweetness and any obscured bittering hops present, but I still think it worked well."
""
""
"O - West Coast Double with a nice smoothness. Great sour taste with a big alcoholic punch. Much less English style flavor than a regular Jack. My favorite so far from Firestone Walker."
"O - love it...big hop flavor. Big flavor period. Up there with some of my favorite IPA's. We don't see many west coast IPA's in Baltimore, but this is as good as any I've had (still love my DFH 90 minute though!) Well done Firestone Walker!"
""
""
"Overall: Very solid DIPA for sure, will deffinitely be trying to track down some fresher examples for proper tasting/reviewing."
""
""
""
""
"A must-try IPA. Top notch stuff."
"Overall: A near perfect example of an Imperial India Pale Ale. Hops weren't as bright and clean, but that's probably because the beer is nearly a month and a half old. Would definitely buy again if I could find it."
""
"Overall - One of the better DIPA's I have had. This is a really tropical hop bomb with some really nice flavors to it. A really solid effort from Firestone and a beer that I wouldn't hesitate having again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very enjoyable and smooth tasting double IPA that hides the 9.5 % abv very well. It has a nice blend of citrus hop and sweet fruit flavors but also has enough balance via the pine, caramel and malt flavors to produce very easy drinking and robust tasting IPA."
""
"A-"
""
""
"worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This brew is absolutely grand, big fan of this one. Bottled no more than 4 months ago and I loved it, would love to have some fresh!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A serious Double IPA which has to do battle with a competitive class of West Coast DIPA's. A substantial brew that when found fresh, should be worthy of refrigerator space."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden and clear, an inviting pour. Aroma is somewhat low on hops but the taste is just fine. Very fruity and floral with a delicate profile and a juicy sweetness. Clean and crisp nonetheless. Medium body and good bitterness to accompany the crisp, refreshing finish. Drinks easier than its """weight"""."
"Overall- This is a nice imperial IPA but it is outclassed by its many competitors. This might approach A- but it is closer to a B+. One factor that brings this closer to this is its low price tag and availability. You could buy 3 at about 17 bucks and have the equivalent of 12 pack and a tasty 12 pack at that."
""
""
"O - One of the first DIPAs I've ever tried and still one of my favorites. It's a shame that I can't find this fresh more frequently. This beer was only two weeks old and had to jump on it. Probably should have gotten more."
"Overall a good west coast DIPA. not the best, but pretty damn good. I've gone back to this one on multiple occasions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For me this DIPA is head of the class so far. The midmouth feel is great and the bitterness, hoppiness, and dryness are perfect. The citrus and fruitiness of this beer linger just long enough before the hopps takeover. Superbly balanced and crafted double IPA"
""
""
"O: amazing beer that creeps up on you quickly. Always great to share but then you have to buy twice as many."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Fort Worth Flying Saucer, one week after Firestone Walker's DFW debut. Pours a medium amber, head and lacing average. Smells of tropical fruits, pine, and caramel. Taste is juicy blackberries, peaches, citrus and pine. Alcohol is well hidden and not overly sweet for a DIPA - well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium, sticky finish begs for the next sip. Overall a fantastic DIPA and one that is very welcome in Texas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you're looking for a Double IPA, it's a fine choice. A bit dangerous in that the 9.5% is masked by very smooth flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hell of a double IPA. Thick, rich, and filling with great complexity and balance."
""
""
"The depth and complexity to this beer develops the more you sip it, making it a memorable experience. This is one of my favorites, and I'm thankful it's readily available in my area when some of its 'top 250 beers' competitors aren't."
""
""
"O: Its a big DIPA, but very drinkable as well, and lends to the sweeter hop profile side but balanced by the imperial IPA bitterness. I enjoyed this and its definitely worth picking up a bomber or a 4 pack."
""
""
""
"Great Double IPA! A 4 pack of this beer didn't last long in my presence. Whoever Jack is, he should be proud that his name is on this beer. Would I drink it again? Double Yes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh so drinkable. Great hop profile and bitterness...but the overall balance is spot on. This is a top notch DIPA. Welcome to Texas Firestone Walker!"
"This is crushable. Absolutely spectacular! How has this eluded me for so long? Imagine this fresher and/or on tap! When no Sucks is around, this is a sure replacement. I will be in search of some more anyway."
""
""
""
""
"Sort of reminds me of the most recent Enjoy By IPA. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"X-factor for the overall score: the bottle art features a male lion about to box a grizzly bear. Nice. I've never seen an IPA that looks this excellent. The carbonation cascades as if a stout while the minimally hazy orange liquid pools beneath gravity's grip. Nose is blunt: bold citrus with floral over/unders. Mouthfeel is bubbly, yet smooth. Tastes like grapefruit rind. Bitter citrus: mission accomplished. Surprisingly sessionable for a 9.5%. No percent boozy. Anyone have a filleted flounder I can eat?"
""
""
""
"Double jack is quite the tasty double IPA. The alcohol is kept in check well. Its starts to show up as I near the bottom of the bottle. I generally prefer my Double IPAs to fall on the drier side of the spectrum. For a Double IPA with a fuller malt present this is still pretty hop-centric. Props to Firestone Walker for giving me one of the best hop experiences this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sadly, the bottled on date was missing, but it tasted quite fresh. For its availability and price point it is an excellent DIPA. I was glad I found a 12oz. for a mix six instead of a bomber. It also changes nicely with a slight temperature warming. Definitely, a go to for a great DIPA in the area for me."

""
""
""

"Fantastic dipa really fruity citrus flavours and not a hint of the abv."
""

"O: A really well done DIPA. Beautiful flavors, nice aroma, good head retention. Overall, very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a very good example of balance in an DIPA. The hops certainly over power to a certain extent, but the malt profile really holds it own in a very nice fashion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- got this in a trade and im so glad I did, this is packed with piney hops and delicious fruit, the texture is very smooth, there no bitter after taste. This beer is very very well done, amazing balance."

"overall.... as i said, it's not my favorite style, and there are a couple of Firestone brews i have tried and did not impress me, but this is decent. it is smooth and i can appreciate the style. i can certainly appreciate the abv! even though i still maintain many brewers use the excess hops to mask the abv. nice brew; i will try a few of the others...."

"All in all, Double Jack is a very impressive beer and definitely one of the best widely available double IPAs on the market."
""
""
"A well crafted beer indeed. The aroma and feel are the beers strong points. A solid dose of hop flavor with just the right amount of bitterness. Citrus overtakes the pine as it warms, the malt is steely and sweet but has a lightness to it as well as a high quality character. I love every beer I've had from this brewery so far."

""
""

""
""
""

""
"Pours a glowing copper with a thick white head. Reflects beautifully in the light. Aroma is pine/resin, fruity, and floral. Taste is nicely balanced and complex. Just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness and nothing overpowering. Pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerine supported by sweet malt. Feel is smooth, elegant, dry, and moderate in body. Lures you in and alcohol can sneak up on you if you're not careful. Definitely a classic from FW."

"O - A damn fine beer! The fact that it isn't available here in Texas alone makes it a tasty bonus, although it's recently been picked up by Ben E. Keith, and should be available here in late April. (I'll believe it when I see it.... we're looking at YOU , TABC!) If this is a textbook example of FSW beers, I can't wait to get my hands on more. DFH 90-Min may be another good Double, but this one is great. Grab as many as you can, or thank your pals that have enough dough to bring you one.... It's like Tits on a Ritz. CHEERS!!!"
""
"Really well done IPA with a strong hop profile. Goes very well with smokey habanero chili! A big beer with high ABV, I was not able to finish even half the bottle on my own. Light and clear slightly orange. Smell is crisp and hoppy. Great light body despite the high attenuation. Overall a really great beer just be careful as it is an almost 10% ABV"
"Lots of flavor in this beer and it's surprisingly drinkable for nearly 10% abv. It's worth sipping though to savor every sip."

"Overall: This is a good brew…I’ve been drinking a plethora in this genre and they can begin to blend together, leaving the truly exceptional standing out…while this is good, it’s not outstanding and blends somewhat into the lower portion of the upper tier of this class (if that makes sense)…the bready malts create a slightly unique flavor…it’s good and for the price tag, $7.99, it’s definitely worth purchasing…this would be a great brew while playing some poker, a loud, talkative poker game…maybe with some chips…(4/5)"
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I will be adding this to my list of beers that I will continuously buy. This is the kind of beer that I could buy and have no regrets. It has the smell and flavor that I look forward to in a really good double IPA. I am excited that there is another great beer out there that I can get my hands on!"
"I've tried every IPA I could get a hold of for the past 10 years and this is definitely one of the good ones."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been drinking this and most FW beers for years...picked up a case of the anniversary in 2007, have had Union Jack on tap, in a 22 oz, and in these little bottles. All in all it's a brilliant hop monster...lots of body and hop richness for a hop head, but enough malt and alcohol to make it stand out. While there's some melon and cream of tartar, the malt and hops balance these like peanut butter with jelly! There's a bold balance that's satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That's not to say that the alcohol wasn't there. This quietly crept up on me and it would be quite hard to have more than one or two of these in a session. While this was enjoyable, this category has a lot of heavyweights that this doesn't quite measure up to. It's a textbook example of what a good Double/Imperial IPA should be without being too bitter or dark and it would be tough to find a hophead that didn't enjoy this at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great DIPA. It deserves the high rating, though the hop flavor is a tad on the skunky side, so beware if you don't like that.Overall, not terribly bitter, with a lot of late-addition flavor. It's pretty darn expensive around here, but that's the only reason I would hesitate to drink more..."

"Very solid DIPA - reminded me a little bit of Double Simcoe with the spiciness and malt flavors. This was much smoother and had a more friendly hop profile, complete with more fruitiness as well.

"Overall its a really, really good IIPA. As far as CA IIPA's go, Id say this the best one thats pretty easily available in bottles. I really cant believe that BA has Sucks and Enjoy By rated higher than this.  its not even close.  This beer is way better then either of those."
"Overall always a phenomenal double IPA. Was glad to see these 12oz bottles as it is not as much of a splurge now to enjoy this beer."

"Pours a golden amber capped with a two and half finger bright white two and half finger head. Excellent retention and significant lacing. A bunch of tropical fruit notes on the nose with hints of flora. Pineapple leads the way joined by mango and papaya. A wave of sweet malt with a hint of caramel midpalate. Finishes with some bittering grapefruit rind smoothed out by sweet malt tones. Big, full body that is slick, but pleasantly creamy with velvety accents. Big malt backbone. This really is an exceptionally balanced DIPA that compares favorably with brews considered to be among the upper echelon."

"Fresh this thing is a beast. Loaded with hop flavor. Big and juicy. Drinks like a pine-infused citrus fruit. This is a good thing."

"Poured a full bomber into a 34oz mug. Darker orange-yellow, crystal clear with a thick foamy white head that dissipated slowly, leaving tons of beautiful lacing. Smell is sweet flowers mostly; hops and pine are less prominent. Taste is bitter on the tongue, but mostly sweet malts upon swallowing, and then the hoppy bitterness comes at the finish, lingering nicely. Alcohol is not very noticeable and blends into the hop flavor; it's a good thing this comes in single bombers instead of 6 packs. Mouthfeel is as expected, crisp but a fuller body than the taste would suggest. Overall not the best DIPA I've had, but certainly a good one and one I'd pick up again."

"Comments: I had this several years ago on tap in Phoenix, and was thrilled to see it in bottles in Illinois. Wasn't quite as mind-blowing from a bottle (not sure of the bottle's age) as on tap. Still very tasty with a delicious mix of fruit flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid DIPA which is year-round and available in 4 packs, great choice if you like sweetness without over-the-top IBU. Very easy drinking and warming. Not my favorite, but I've enjoyed it multiple times and will continue to enjoy."
"D: plenty of hop flavor, while still remaining to have balance. super tasty. go get some, get it free if you can."
""
""
"Taste isnt quite as wonderful as the aroma but still very good. Snappy bitterness up front gives way to more delicate hop notes. Pine at first then grapefruit, finally ending a little tannic. The malt doesnt do as much as i would have thought from a taste standpoint, but the beer does have a good medium/medium-thick body. A little livelier carbonation might have helped the hop complexity, but overall this is a nice double ipa. Seems like Firestone Walker has their IPAs down."
"O~ Very nice & extremely drinkable...could get in trouble with this one. This has held up well for it's age. Bravo FW!"
""
""
"Again, Firestone delivers an excellent high quality beer with the Double Jack. Imperial in every way, this beer tastes like a party in your mouth. Large and bold, it gives you what you would expect from a double. Definitely worth the money too; not too expensive."

"I always but always have some Double Jack on hand in my fridge. It is a staple in my rotation, possibly my favorite. Citrus fruit and grapefruit are awesome in both nose and taste. I can drink a few of these not noticing the alcohol and it creeps up on you. Who's complaining? Also the finale of many a session for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It was a damn good DIPA, but nothing that really blew my mind. I would put this in the upper echelon of DIPA's but not in the top 5. Union Jack was my first IPA (what an experience that was!) and still one of my favorites. I was expecting my experience with Double Jack to be just as special but it was not."

"12oz bottle, pours amber in color with amazing clarity; bubbly white head leaves some chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are awesome with fresh floral hops, citric grapefruit, honey, caramel, biscuity malt. Tastes are just as appealing as the aromas with sweet biscuity malt, caramel, floral hops, sweetened grapefruit, honey, some pine on the bitter finish with some tropical pineapple and mango making an appearance in there as well - Citra hops I presume. Tremendous balance. Smooth medium body, pleasant carbonation, alcohol is more warming than hot. This one wowed me the first time I had it, and finally got around to reviewing it. Just excellent! A favorite for sure."

"Nice IPA. Poured from bottle to a round glass to pick up the very nice and sweet aroma..some peach and floral notes in the nose. The beer has a copper and tinge of amber when held up to the light. The head was a nice, creamy and somewhat fizzy, three fingers deep…and thinned very slowly. Very nice lacing on the glass. The taste has a clean, sweet, piney and a hint of caramel with dried fruits. It was crisp to the mouth and the flavor was a long lasted, but not offensive in the following swallows. Very nice IPA!"

"O - One of my favorite DIPA's. The reason I'm a hop head."
"O- I enjoyed this much more than Union Jack but that's usually the story with me and double IPAs vs. singles."
"Overall: This is an excellent IIPA, and one that I would gladly seek out again for the woody, vanilla aromas and tastes that are unique to this product as far as my taste buds have roamed. Some of the flavors could and should have been better reconciled and integrated so as to make them stand out and really define the complexity, but as it is the beer is excellently done. This is the first beer from Firestone that I have really liked. I hope it is a sign of things to come. 17.5/20"
"O: Fantastic brew from a solid brewery. This could be a nice crisp refresher in the warmer months but has the booze and body to be enjoyed on a cold day as well. Like many Firestone Walker beers, you cannot go wrong with picking this up. Will continue to drink this guy for as long as they distribute around my area."
"Overall - Fantastic Double IPA. Wonderful balance. Strong, complex hop character. Hoppy, without being overly bitter. My favorite offering in Firestone-Walker's """Pale""" run."

"So I stopped by my neighborhood store and the owner insisted I try my 1st! IPA, he highly recommended Firestone Double Jack and I've tried more since but I absolutely love this beer. Smell, taste are amazing and it does the job. Great for a poker night and just chillin around the house."

"Pours clear golden with nice head. Heavy lacing as head recedes. Huge aroma of honey, citrus and pine. Very similar to Founders Double Trouble or Bell’s Hopslam. The best smelling beer I have ever encountered, wow! Sweet honey citrus start, with nice hop bite going down. Piney hops aftertaste sticks with you. Nice refreshing mouthfeel, but with slight alcohol warmth. Hides booze extremely well. A new top 5 DIPA for me."
""
""
""
"A fantastic double IPA. My first brew from Firestone Walker has me very impressed and ready to try the Double DBA and Parabola that I have on deck. Super hoppy with a nice balance of present malts that stay in the background. Certainly worthy of seeking out and I hope this won't be my last Double Jack."
""
""
""
""

"Overall – You really can't go wrong with this beer. It got a little of everything taste wise and it has a nice balance. I'd like a tad more hop bitterness if I could change anything."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just as great out of the bottle as it is on-tap but the draft version takes the cake in a comparison because this beer blows your mind and mouth coming from a keg. I like that this beer comes in a 4-pack of 12oz. bottles now because it allows more frequent enjoyment at a more manageable intake. A full bomber seemed like gluttony...at least for one person."
"Overall - I was a little let down here. It was a good beer, for sure, but after such a delicious smell, I thought it fell short."

"Something about this beer ... I was looking for an IPA that wasn't over the top and had some balance but still gave you some great hop forward taste. This beer was overwhelmingly good. It was refreshing, tasteful, warming, comforting and amazingly delicious. I know this won't be a perfect experience for all; albeit, for me it just seemed so at the moment."
""
""
""
"I have had this before, but didn't really remember it in any detail. When I first popped it open, it seemed ok. I noticed the thinnish body and relative lack of malt character, and was kind of disappointed. But the hops do shine brightly, and it is well balanced. I suspect this is more or less what the brewers were after, and it's a good beer. If it cost as much as other DIPA bombers I probably wouldn't get it much, but since if was $3-4 less than other bombers where I live, I could see revisiting this one now and again."
""
"O - This is a beer that doesn't wow me, but is very good at what it does. There are no defining characteristics, yet no weaknesses. I can't decide what hop flavors are most dominant between floral (mostly in the aroma), citrus, and pine. Well balanced, complex, and pretty much just what I think of when I think of the DIPA style. It is a very good representative of the style and I recommend it if you have not yet tried it."
"o - a solid beer, well crafted, and enjoyable. had to take my time getting through this one though, 9.5% abv catches up fast. i'd like to get my hands on more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Dominant yeast, mild malts combine to subdue the intense hops. Reminds me of Souther Tier 2xIPA but more pronounced."
"O-Awesome, get it now if you can"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"More balanced hop character than others, good smooth body, pleasant sipper. This is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have tried, I will be looking for it again in the future. I prefer it over Ruination and Dogfish for great complex profile and drinkability."
""
""
""
"O: A total hop fix, one of the most tropical tasting brews I've had. The nose is just awesome. Really pretty looking beer too. A tad more balance and itd be perfect for me. This is a quintessential west coast IPA, probably the most tropical hop beer I've had. Must try."
"O: This beer smells wonderful and the taste is complex, ending in a very nice toasted malt flavor. I liked the smell and taste of this beer better than the Breckenridge 471, but this beer didn't look or feel quite as good at that one. Overall, I'd say it's a tie between the two."

"D/O: All day every day. Love this beer."

"O: This beer gets it right where it really counts. The smell and taste is one of the best out there. This beer really does remind me of Sculpin and Zombie Dust. The 9.5% abv is really not visible at all. Much more easy-drinking than you would think. I'd suggest this if you can find it fresh. The brew I'm drinking is three weeks old. Solid offering all around."
""

"O - if only they offered this in 12 oz bottles. I'll stick with Union Jack for now!"
""
"O: Very drinkable, with a full taste of a DIPA. Not the profile I was expecting but greatly surprised and liked what it was. If I was to sum up this beer's characteristics quickly, it would be finesse over power but still big. Definitely will be drinking this again. Thank you Firestone Walker!"

"Double Jack packs a punch. It's in your face, but it's not over the line and is still quite palatable. Makes you sit back a bit after a gulp, but the sweetness pulls it back enough to make it less of a sipping beer. One of the best DIPAs for sure."
"O - Such a great Double IPA. A must for double IPA fans. I really enjoyed this beer."
""
""
"The alcohol actually distracts from the nice hop presence."
""
""
""
""
"Oh yeah... that's nice. The grapefruit/tangerine type flavors show themselves a bit more here... but tropical beauty is still the highlight of this one I think. Booze and bitterness are both kept in check. Well done, Firestone Walker! Would love to this in the MN market."
"A gentleman's Double IPA. Double Jack brings the hops you expect from one, but releases them in a well mannered way that won't redden your face nor cause choas to your palate."
"O - 4.0 - Got this from a place online in a batch with two other hoppy beers that had gone dead. Since there's no date on this, I'm not sure how old it is or whether I'm drinking what the brewers intended. Overall it was good and pleasant. Reading other reviews here, I suspect mine has faded."
""
""
""
""
"Lots & lots of raw rubber intense pine grapefruit on the nose this has an orangy golden colour. Not big head, maybe a quarter inch at most, but the head is very glossy. In the mouth there is some sap and malt, maybe a touch of silk too, but certainly matter than I expected. Some passing hints of malt in the background but totally surrounded by all those hops and stuffing. So so much stuffed in here but it remains a really begging linear harmonious whole. A powerful intense beer that goes the distance ."
""
"o- One of the better west coast dipas on the market. Very fortunate to have it regularly; pick up a bottle every month or two, really wished they had six packs of this. Firestonewalker doesn't disappoint"
"O: Not super complex, but sometimes you can't put a price on drinkability. If you like citrusy and hoppy DIPAs, then this is the beer for you. If you are looking for other flavors besides citrus in your beer, then this might not be the one for you."
"Overall I would put this as a slightly above average Double IPA. I would definitely be happy to order it again (and probably will), but it didn't entirely blow me away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice smooth translucent crisp golden color, which holds light really well. Nice bubbles. About two fingers of white head, some retention on the glass. I absolutely love the smell of Double Jack. It's floral, sweet, piney, and citrus, but heavy on the former two. Taste is more pine and citrus forward, which I do not mind at all. Aftertaste is piney and resinous, it lingers for sure. Mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable, with some bite; fairly crisp. Overall, I really like Double Jack, very cool to see it in 12oz format. For me, smell here is a huge plus. Cheers."
""
""
"Overall - Outstanding beer, good example of any style, but especially of the DIPA. This is the kind of beer a brewery can really hang their hat on and be proud of. Excellent work from the FW crew. Highly recommended"
""
""
""
""
"this one is definitely one of my favorite doubles on the market for a few reasons and here they are. yes the Hop complexion is pronounced but its even release of the malt is only noticed when enough of this great liquid is assimilated by the pallet at least for me anyway. a blast of floral and fruity notes hit the noise first before having the first sip and then the complexities abound when into the first few real mouth fulls. on draft its mouthfeel is absolute perfection not too sharp not too thin, a good melding of ibu's and sweeter characters are prevalent. definitely a stand out beer for a stand out brewery here no matter how's its served this one is gold in a glass for me!"

"Poured from 22oz bottle into tulip. Pours a clear golden color with thick head. Strong strong pineapple aromas...most pineapple I ever smelled in a brew. Taste is very hoppy, citrus, some sweet malts, but hops dominate. Its a bit over bitter for me, but id have over and over again. Can wait to start seeing the 12oz 4-packs!"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: a very well-crafted double IPA that's probably in my top 5 for the style. Definitely makes me want to seek out more."

"O - excellent. This is just a fantastic double ipa. Concentrated juicy flavor but the aroma is truly killer. So glad they put bottled it in 12oz four packs. That means i get to enjoy this awesome brew more often."

""
""
""
""
"O - Another solid ale from Firestone-Walker. Their selection never disappoints."
""
""
"O-a solid DIPA"
""
""
"Flavor contains all of the elements from the nose but emphasizes mostly the dank, grapefruit pith, and resinous hopping aspects at a surprisingly medium-strength level in combination with enough caramel malt to keep the palate wrecking action partially in check. It manages to be big and bold without going over the top and becoming just another mere hop bomb. More well-balanced and complex than most DIPAs I've had to date! It was well worth trying, and I recommend that you try it too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden for 9.50 % abv. Their is a bittersweet aftertaste, and this is an incredibly smooth beer. I am glad I had a chance to try this."
""
"Sweet yet spicey. Citrus and pines. Good balance. Yellow to brown blouse when held up to a window. Very fine carbonation. The lacing on the glass is unique - doesn't fall off but also not webbed. Nose is orange and pine sap. Some malt syrup is present via the pine sap. Taste is sweet at first with a grade A maple syrup and the. Quickly spices with the hops."

"Notes: Nice DIPA. Loads of hops and big flavors. Alcohol and sweetness were a bit much for me, and when combined with that slight cloying aspect, it was a little much. Very nice DIPA to sip on though. For the price it is a nice treat but not an elite DIPA."
""
"Overall this is a solid DIPA that I would go for again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great pine and grapefruit whack. This beer makes only a slight concession to the malts - just enough malt to keep the hops from getting out of control. This is an outstanding version of the completely hops focused type of IPA. This should be on any hop heads' list of must trys."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Double Jack was good, and was certainly with the try, yet it is by no means my DIPA of choice. Would I repeat? Certainly. Would I go out of my way to repeat? No."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am so glad I did not pay for this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really great stuff: one of the better DIPAs I believe I've had. It really emphasises the hop flavour, and while it really ups the ante in this department, it never gets harsh or unbalanced. Great stuff, once again, Messrs. Firestone Walker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's been a backlash to the big hop bomb lately, chiefly coming from the session/sweet end of the spectrum, and for many good reasons I admit. Many hop bombs are poorly crafted, and rely solely on the bitterness profile with no care taken with other characteristics. This is not the case with this fine tasting brew. While the hops are definitely front and center, belting out all the greatest hits you came to hear, the backing band still find all the right notes and help put on a helluva show."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful golden orange like copper with a thin white head that dies away quickly but does leave slight and thin lacing. The beer is hazy and pretty opaque but really beautifully coppered. The beer smells big and boozy with lovely wet floral hops heavy with pine and hints of citrus and mango. Malt presence isn’t really apparent in the smell but there is a good alcoholic bite that suggests the 9.5%. The beer tastes wonderfully of citrus pine hops and nice light backbone of sweet pale malts, though there is a staled medicinal septic taste around the sides and it lingers in the mouth. Perhaps that is the aspirin taste that some reviewers are found of referencing. The afterburst of fruity hops after the swallow is fantastic and tropical, bringing to mind mangoes, pineapples, oranges, and grapefruits (all the appropriate hop-fruit analogs!). The alcohol is well hidden in the taste with just a nice warming as it goes down the gullet and a slight bite as the beer first touches the mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth with a slight bite from the carbonation at the beginning that swiftly mellows out to leave the tongue cloying with sweet bitters and slightly oozing with saliva. The sides of the mouth feel strangely dry considering how wet the tongue feels. Overall this is a great DIPA. It’s a little unbalance with a ton of terrific hops but not enough malt to cut back on the medicinal bitter sting, but it still tastes great that hide all but a ghost of the 9.5% alcohol. Plus who can complain about more hop flavor? Great hops in this beer."
""
""
"That liquid crosses my lips and there is no doubt that I will marry this brew. The front loaded carbonation dances on my tongue while the subtle malt holds onto the hops tightly. This is a dance best preformed w/out judgment. This is prom night w/out a chaperone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very nice hops profile and bitterness and the overall balance is spot on."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Good appearance, decent head retention. Piney, fresh hop aroma and smells malty too. Gets more pungent as it warms. Taste is good but not great: lots of piney hops, some malt too but it clearly leans towards the West Coast style. I prefer my IPAs juicy, though, and Double Jack doesn't do that for me. Above average, not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Thick, fuller side of side of medium. Low carbonation. Bitter finish. Pretty much all is expected for the style."
"O: A fantastic beer, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, well balanced IPA."

"Overall, another strong offering from FW, and a great way to celebrate International IPA Day!"

"Overall: A good beer in my opinion."

"didn't blow my socks off, but it's still a very good beer overall. personally, i feel a lighter version of this beer would fare much better for my palate. union jack, here i come!"
""
""
"O: A really fine IPA, this is good...."
""
""
"It's a rare thing for me when a double IPA is outshined by it's single counterpart. Union Jack is just that good. I think this one offers a little more in the nose, but the extra alcohol and stickiness of the Double Jack get in the way a little more on the tongue. Don't get me wrong, though, it's still a great IIPA, but when you also consider the stiffer competition in this field, I can't give it my highest recommendation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A real nice IPA! Really smooth considering the ABV. It starts pretty hard but finishes real smooth. It is better than most of 1000's IPAs out there. This takes their good single IPA to the next level. I would recommend this beer to any hop head. Enjoy!"
"This is an overall great DIPA. It's a little hot, but that's not too much of a detractor."
""
"Overall, this is a tremendous beer. In my opinion its the second best double ipa I've ever had, just slightly behind Hopslam. Its amazing. I can't imagine having this readily available year round."
""
""
"Pours a dark golden with a beautiful golden-white head with fantastic lacing. Scent of pine, grapefruit, and molasses. Taste is smoooth for a DIPA, hides the 9.5% real well. Notes of pithy grapefruit, biscuit, toffee, and a bit of malt. Oily DIPA, makes for a nice mouthfeel. Solid, well crafted DIPA."
"Overall: Very tasty, and recommended. Not Firestone Walker's best (especially for price) by a long shot, but still hold's to their standard of excellence."
""
"Feels full in body, but very drinkable as if it were a regular strength IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Wow. Huge aroma. Grassy, citrus, tropical. I think I hit most of the hop descriptions. This is so good. I think it has jumped to #1 2x IPA I have access to. Big bitterness like it should and not the warming I remembered from this 9.5% ale. Good carbonation. So glad FW finally started showing up in the 4 corners area."
"Had on-tap at No Idea Tavern in Baltimore (clever name? not so much). This was a fantastic (double) IPA. Maintained a good balance and wasn't overly bitter, super smooth and tasty, and was finished way too quickly.. always a sign of a good brew. Great hoppy aroma and awesome mouthfeel, I can see why it's been rated so highly and for $5 a pint it's tough to beat this one."
""
""
""
"Poured at a good temperature with a large, foamy, cream-colored head that subsided after a bit and lots of lace. Color is a clear yellow amber. Aroma is resin, hop, malt, grain. Flavor's like nose, carbonic tang up front, follow immediately by bitter/sweet and the other components. Body and carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, long, and super drinkable. It's a let's git it beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear, medium golden color with a short, off-white head. The head lingers no more than average time. Big pine resin bouquet with intermittently emerging citrus notes. The beer has an oily moutfhfeel. Pine flavor comes through immediately, but light-roasted barley malt breaks through to create a not-so-well balanced, but very well-engineered DIPA."

"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops notes is quite dominant with some dry caramel malt with some residual sugar also noticeable. Taste is a hops forward mix of citrus notes with light piney notes with some bitterness. Malt backbone offset some of the hops presence with light residual sugar notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Solid beer though I was expecting more floral hoppy notes."

"A big ’ol Double IPA, that’s for sure. Pretty good stuff, albeit with 4 months on it. Could imagine how good this would be if super fresh. Other than the age, the only real knock is the booze...this one is fairly hot for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a surprising light DIPA.  I am having it after a beach day that was super hot and humid.  Even with 9.5%, it is refreshing and goes down easy. The carbonation is mild and the beer is well balanced in every way.  "

"Bomber poured into glass. Pours a copper orange color with nice white bubbly head on top. Smells of pine, citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, mango. Taste follows the nose with the awesome citrus and pine notes. Nice caramel malt background balances the bitterness from the hops very well. Mouthfeel is medium, nicely carbonated, a bit syrupy though. Overall, an excellent double IPA, glad I was able to bring this beer back to Louisiana from Cali."

"A nice brew from FW. I prefer Stone's Ruination in this class, but this ale is no slouch by any means."

"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I'd love to try one that I know is fresh to be able to see if I missed anything. I found this one to be great, so if it gets better than this you're in for a real treat. Try it."

"Such a great DIPA, one of my favorites. So carefully assembled and everything blends and balances so well. It's intense, without being over the top with bitterness or body or anything like that. I do love the regular Union Jack too, but I definitely appreciate the extra complexity of this one without seeming like it's such a huge beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4/5): I like this beer; I don't love it. It has lots of bold hop flavor but I feel it's held back a little by the sweetness and viscosity of the malt bill and the touch of booziness. I would really like to try this beer from a fresh bottle and compare it to how it tasted on tap."
""
""
"overall, a world class DIPA IMHO. probably my favorite to date. just love this stuff."
""
"I only drink IPAs if possible given the state of my current taste buds and I would rate this beer above Pliney or Sculpin, two of my past favorites. I have had it many times in the bottle and many times on draft. It is a beer that is sensitive to age as many of the IPA s are and if mistreated will begin to show its fruity side quickly. The ability of what seems to be mostly west coast brewers to make a balanced IPA at 9.5% without any significant alcohol sweetness amazes me and I wish east coast brewers could match the taste.I really would prefer less alcohol but its stablemate, Union Jack is not hoppy or bitter enough for my palate although still another excellent beer."

"O- A world class DIPA, a perfect representation of the style and all of its glory."

"O: Definitely my go-to DIPA for now!"
""
""
"O- Very solid IIPA offering."
"Nice hop bitterness up front with bitter orange, grapefruit, and herb dancing on your palate. Then notes of sweet orange and apricot waltz into a solid malt backbone. The warmth of the alcohol is hidden in the sweet citrus notes that linger and compete any dry notes that would claim the finish. This is a big tasty beer with subtle complexities. Certainly the best II IPA I've had."
""
"Don't know if I got this super fresh or what, but this seems way way under-rated. Just tried heady topper for the first time a week ago, and never thought I would find anything even close. However, this is right up there and in terms of appearance is far superior; it is, perhaps, a tad to bitter though. Will definitely be back for more."
"Overall I love this one. I mean, it's a Firestone pale, could it really be anything but great. One of the trusted IIPAs that I always go back to"

"O- A nice offering from Firestone Walker. Wish I knew if this was a fresh bottle or not. Can't find any bottle dating on it. The hops seemed kind of subdued."

""
""
""
"Overall-A great DIPA, up there with the other greats like Ruination and Pliny."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I thought this a good double IPA, certainly wonderful in smell, but in the mouth the bitter rind-and-stem notes took over just a bit too much, making other flavors difficult to locate. I have no doubt, however, that hopheads will like this one, as it seems that they make up a good 75% of the flavors."

"Pours a hazy orangey copper with a thick white thumbs width head. Nice lacing. A wonderfully hoppy aroma with some pine and orange in the front and some sweet tropical fruits, peach and a little malt coming in the back. As it warms, the sweet, fruity side of the aroma takes over. Flavor mimics the aroma quite well with a medium level bitterness to it. A crisp mouthfeel with some activity Lacking any creaminess or silkiness to it though. Overall, one of those beers I have forever wanted to try but always chose something else instead when at the store. Better late than never I suppose, this is a very nice beer from Firestone like I expected it to be."

"O - a nice beer that promises to yield much better results when fresh. I will revise my review when I obtain a newer bottle. This is for those who are debating on an older offering. Truly drinkable and enjoyable and oddly, even without the hop character, the ABV is still hidden remarkably. This was a gift so no complaints beside the tease of what a fresher bottle will yield. To quote the Governator; I'll be back."
""
"Overall (4.5): This is a palate-challenger, alright. Not as abrasive as Palate Wrecker or Heady Topper (definitely not as hoppy as HT, in my opinion), but this is damn hoppy, big, and gorgeous. Glad to have finally gotten this bastard fresh—very, very big difference compared to somewhat-old Double Jack, where the hops lose their bite and get kind of catty. This, on the other hand, is gorgeous, and I will be seeking this out given that it’s fresh in the future. Damn good beer."
""
"A nice citrus-bitter-balanced double IPA. I'd put it just a step below the top tier."
"O - This is a great DIPA. If I could find it fresh, it's an easy go to if I can't find something new."

"Overall: This only gets me more excited about the Sucaba barleywine sitting in the cellar. Firestone-Walker has impressed me on their first showing. I'll definitely be back for more based on this and I suggest any hop fans head out and pick this up. Not for the hops (there's hoppier stuff out there) but for the balance here. This is a really great Imperial IPA example and everyone should get a chance to enjoy it."

"Served in a tulip, a very clear and bright mild orange gold lives under a sudsy head with a great retention. A well tended hop garden of an aroma gently cuddles up to the nose with inviting notes of nicely mended floral and pine hops. Bitter tingly hop notes romance the palate up front before a gentle and smooth syrup of citrus glides along into a resinous bitter finish. Notes of orange, pineapple, and grapefruit citrus are displayed beautifully in the hops with what seems to be the perfect malt complement."
""
"A very nice DIPA, caught it a bit down on the hops yet it's got a bitter kick, very smooth, downright dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Well balanced. Get it fresh if you can. FW really knows what they are doing."
""
"Overall this beer is great a definite repurchase."
""
""
"O- A really, really solid Imperial IPA and one that lives up to the hype (and just as good as I remember from the one sample I had on tap nearly a year ago). If I needed to draw a comparison, it is eerily similar to that of Lagunitas' Imperial Red in appearance, aroma but with a slightly higher bitter/dry finish. At almost $8 for a 22oz bottle, I would choose the Lagunitas offering simply for the value factor. However, if you have yet to sample Double Jack, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to at least one."

"O- Overall this one deserves high marks. It is over-priced and goes down too fast, but a true pleasure to sip. I am enjoying this one out on a shaded patio in 90 degree heat and still find it refreshing. I have also had it in the wintertime and found it to be a nice cold weather companion. Now that I can get it in four packs, I can see it becoming my Saturday night regular."

"In the player: Tycho - Dive"
"O: Good beer. I'd recommend it, if not have again. As I said, if you want a Double IPA, seek elsewhere."

"O - Easy drinking, balanced, and delicious. It's a stunning brew, and my favorite from Firestone Walker. The extremely flavorful hops and strong malt character in this beer make this one of the most well-rounded DIPA's on the market."

"O: I can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into this brew, Firehouse definitely displays master craftsmanship with this ale. An outstanding representative of the west coast style."
"Overall - Pretty delicious, well worth it. Will get again at some point."
"I'm really impressed with this beer, then again, FW has yet to not impress me. A great, different DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is pretty good but not my favorite double ipa at the moment. It need more assertive hopping for my palette."
"O: I would purchase this beer regularly if FW sold it in six-packs or made it a standard bomber. In short, give it a try!"
"o - terrific beer and one of the best DIPAs i've had."

"O- outstanding 2IPA that just dissapears in front of you so drinkable so delicious wouls love to have access to this one"

"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a clear light orange amber with a moderate white head and lacing. Hoppy aroma with pineapple and citrus. Not as hop cone intense as some DIPAs. Taste is intense hops up front with light citrus, light fruit, grapefruit and malt. Hops dominate middle and finish. A bit more dry finish than I prefer. A well made DIPA, but I'd like a bit more malt body."
"Was served this beer at Mews Tavern fresh from the tap into a snifter. Crystal clear with a small head and some lacing. Had a delicious citrus/fruity/earthy aroma which was extremely inviting. First taste can be described as an excellent balance of tangerine tartness and IPA bitterness. Aftertaste was quite bitter and earthy. Would definitely drink again! Exceptionally smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful burnished gold, stunningly clear, enormous dense foamy head hangs around, leaves thick rings on the glass as I sip it down. Just a knockout in the looks department, couldn't be more inviting. If you don't think a beer's appearance means much, just take a look at how this one compares to other DIPAs, many of which are notably hazier. Smells of resinous pine, somewhat floral and a little catty. There's some breadiness and malty sweetness on the nose too. Mmhmm. Taste hits with initial perfect balance, the hop flavor presents itself and vamps for a bit before the bitterness takes center stage and the brew dries out real hard. Bitterness just hangs and hangs, lovely. Taste-wise, you'd never know this beer rocks a 9.5 abv, totally stashed behind a malt decoy and a great wall of hops. Pleasantly medium bodied, a bit viscous and sticky, could maybe use just a touch more carbonation. All in all, an absolute work of art. It is easy to become jaded in a world where we've been handed big bold imperial IPAs for several years, but Double Jack manages to make a unique mark. I've had almost nothing in this style that I haven't enjoyed; remembering one among the rest doesn't always happen, and it does with this example. Not to be missed."
""
"Bomber poured into a tulip. It is a golden color with a decent amount of carbonation. Smells are floral hops, honey, citrus, and light grassiness. Taste is a blend of lemon, honey, and bitter orange peel. Some earthy grassiness is present as well. The alcohol hides itself fairly well, keeping it pretty drinkable."
""
""
""
"Firestone Walker Double Jack is a dense, very clear, sparkling golden ale topped with an elastic off-white foam that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a huge floral hop aroma. It smells sweet and candy like, pretty citrusy. It's pretty full bodied and smooth. The finish is quick and clean. It's flavorful and well balanced. There's a soft sweetness from start to finish. It tastes floral at first, but the bitterness turns to citrus by the finish. The aftertaste is long and bitter, with the flavor of orange peel and fresh cracked black pepper. The sweetness hangs on for a while as well. This is really solid stuff. I'll buy this again, for sure."
""

""
""
""
""

"This one is lacking in bite, as the beer is quite smooth, almost erring on thin. This goes down really slick. The flavors are not as pronounced as I had hoped. The citrus character is almost muted, and the hops are not all that flavorful. The alcohol comes forward a bit as there is an ethanol wash on the finish. I was really excited for this one, but it ended up a bit of a letdown. Not a terrible beer, just a slightly above average one. I'd like to try a fresher version."

"o - overall a homerun. probably the best accessible IIPA for me in NY. the freshness on this beer really makes it. after an ounce pour at the tasting, i immediately got a growler fill. SO good."
""
"Overall: You see it, you buy it. It isn't perfect but it F'n good! Salud!"
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is about as sippable (or gulpable) as a regular American IPA. The body delivers wave after wave of flavor while somehow never becoming sticky or overly coating. The carbonation is just barely fizzy, creating a satisfying, crisp swallow."
""
"Overall, a pretty well balanced dipa, if there is such a thing. God hop profile, fairly complex with a nice supporting malt flavor."
"O: This is my first IPA for FSW, only had Parabola prior. I'm not sure how fresh this is since I can't find the bottled date but it was still declicious. It was certainly a good DIPA however for the money there are plenty of better choices I've grown used to around Michigan. (Founders, Bells, Weyerbacher, etc)"
"O- This is like a showcase for hops which are wonderfully aromatic and flavorful without excessive bitterness. The hops are nicely balanced by the malt and perhaps the alcohol content. The grapefruit nose comes through in the taste and is a real plus for me. This is one I plan to put in the cart when I find it."
""
"I have to be honest and say I have never been a fan of Firestone beers... I was just at their brand new taproom that they opened (restaurant) and had a few of their samples. This beer was by far probably the best smelling iipa or for that matter any ipa that I have smelled. The taste was fine; it wasnt bad; I gave it a 3.5 because I had two of this beer during dinner. I would get it again, if there werent any better IPA's available. However, that aroma was worth it in itself..."
""
""
"Pours orange with a finger length head. Aroma is pine and apricot. Flavor is a balance of citrus and malt. Grapefruit, orange, and pine resin. Mouthfeel is medium full. Flavor lingers on the tongue. This beer is great. This beer is very sessionable for the style and the alcohol is well hidden"
""
"O- I love DIPA/IPA's, but feel that some are just too hopped to enjoy on a regular basis; this is extremely drinkable for 9.5% ABV and my latest """go-to""" DIPA"

"Just how I like my dipa's subtle hop pop slight alcohol presence and all the buzz definitely worth a case if you you can find in west Penn"

"The reduced bitterness lends this a great drinkability. The hop profile reminded me very much of Little Creatures Big Dipper, however coming straight from the source this was, not surprisingly, tastier."

""
"Pours a wonderful apricot color with light fizziness and a respectable head. Head sticks around for the whole bottle. Smell is solid. Very floral and full of subdued citrus and pine notes. Nose is definitely the strength of this brew. Taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel leaves none to be desired. Overall actually a great beer. Hard to believe it packs a 9.5% hit."

"Picked up a bomber at Brilbecks in Syracuse. Poured clear gold with a tall white head. The aroma has a perfumey pine resin with a light earthy undertone like lemon seeds. The flavor follows with a building a sweet (at first) grapefruit hit which dries out with floral notes and that same pine resin. I love that this beer is really no heavier than a normal IPA. The hops don't get lost in the malt and the sugar doesn't bog you down. Great DIPA."
""
""
"O: The strength of the alcohol is more part of the statement this beer makes, rather than something to be hidden. That being said, it doesn’t distract from the top-notch hop profile, especially in the nose."
"Awesome beer and reasonably priced as well. Hop heads rejoice and buy more than 1 bottle. A quality standby."
""
"Overall: The hops, citrus and honey are balance very well. The drinkability is phenomenal. A nice medium body too. Very well done brew. Cheers."

"O: not my very DIPA, more balanced and English styled (a thought I remember having about the Union Jack IPA as well), lost some points in the taste category, but I would probably purchase again if I saw it fresh and on tap"
"Wish I bought a few more of these. An excellent brew. Worth seeking out."
""
"A great DIPA. One of the sweeter, boozier ones, but tasty just the same."
"O - Delicious DIPA, one of my favorites. I like the difference between the strong pine aroma and grapefruit flavor. Very drinkable for a big beer, not as complex as some others but it doesn't need to be."
""
""
"O: A delightfully balanced beer that drinks so easy and smooth. I'm stoked this is a regular offering as sometimes those are simply the best. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!"
""
""
"Ok this is the first beer since my daughter was born 3 days ago (and a bit before that as well), so I hope it is worth it. All indications are this was a good choice. The appearance is a light golden amber with a white frothy head, which recedes to cling around the glass without much surface lacing. A little more translucent than I would expect for a DIPA. The aroma is crazy, I am confused but I like it at the same time. You get the standard hop floral notes, pine and citrus, but there is something very unique about this brew. I read another review that described a """sweaty""" characteristic, and I laughed because that's the best way I can describe it - like an earthy, sweaty smell. The flavor is bold but balanced, the bitterness of the hop character offset by the background malty sweetness. I don't know what combo of hops they used (I think I taste Simcoe in there) but whatever it is works great. The mouthfeel is very smooth, the abv is well hidden and just the right amount of carb, a nice followup to a balanced DIPA like this. Easily one of the best of this style out there."
""

""

"Very highly recommended."

"D - Very distinct with an almost harsh hop profile. The aroma is excellent but the flavor profile is sharp and very sweaty/oniony. Not bad, but it hurts the drinkability a bit."

"O. A good beer. It wasn't anything out of this world. I've had many better DIPA's. It's worth a try and tastes good, but not something to go searching for."

"O - A very good DIPA that leans on the hoppier side of the style, which isn't a bad thing at all. It brings a strong hop presence but has just enough malty sweetness to balance the beer overall. This is one of those beers where everything about it is good and there are no clear opportunities for improvement, yet it has nothing about it that screams phenomenal. Solid offering from FW and a very good deal for the price"
""

"Excellent beer when fresh."
"O: I really enjoy the citrus this brings, it is almost like a tangerine cocktail. It is not mind blowing or overally complex, but very good, I would definitely get this again."
"O: A definite must-have for any IPA or DIPA lover, the process this beer goes through when brewed gives it a different feel and taste than other big DIPAs, and while that might leave serious hop-heads wanting, it provides a depth of character to overlook that."

"O: A excellant double IPA the mouthfeel is quite nice a smoothness to it. I would put this up there as one of the better DIPA i've been lucky enough to try."
"O: An excellent DIPA, nowhere near a barleywine (that's a good thing). I had no problem finishing the bottle by myself. I would really like to try this fresh vs. 4 months old. There are still lots of hops, but I'll bet there were more 3 months ago. Highly recommended."

"O: Nice hops pull too muchbut very good for an AIPA."
"O - Fantastic DIPA. Easily one of the best I've had."
"Orange colour, ring of white head with some lace on the glass. Smell is full of citrus and tropical fruit, bright tangerine and orange, pineapple and to a lesser extent grapefruit, good malt presence and some lemon-lime scents as well. Taste follows the nose bursting with tropical fruit and citrus, tangerine, lemon, orange, lightly sweet malt rolls in around the middle, more tropical fruit flavours in the finish as well, just bitter enough. Oily, medium carbonation, medium-full body and quite slick. I really enjoyed this really drinkable stuff, solid DIPA, was told that this was purchased a while back but its so well made that the freshness wasn't an issue for me, could this be even more fruity when fresh? I know i will look for this next time i'm in the states though."
"Poured a clear orange, with a transient white head. A light film and a tight collar retain atop this. Bright hops and citrus notes in the nose, floral with even a bit of tropical fruit suggestions. Lots of orange and tangerine really. Good malt character, I got a lot of caramel and toffee like sweetness. Taste is similar, chewy orange and tangerine notes with again, some tropical fruit leanings. Lots of malt in a sticky and sweet fashion, sets a good base for this beer. Profile isn't incredibly complex, but it's quite effective. Heavy medium mouthfeel, good chewiness and a moderate bitterness. Not the best freshness on this bottle I'd gather, bit the taste is well retained. I've love to revisit this fresher."
"Overall: A very astounding DIPA. I have only had a handful in the past, but this is a style I prefer over others."
""
"Overall, a pretty tasty DIPA. It's a sneaky brew for the ABV. I'd definitely buy this again but don't know if I could make it through more than a bottle in an evening for fear of what it would do to my palette."

"I wish I could get six-packs of this stuff! Well, it pours clear and golden into my Hulk pint glass. The smell is a very inviting citrus hops. The taste follows the nose closely, but has a great bitter hoppy bite, followed by a muted malt. I love Double Jack and wish I could get it more often."

"This is an impressive Imperial IPA with great balance between the malt and citrus hops with great hints of wood/pine and one of the best aromas I can recall."
""
""
""
"O- Might be the best DIPA i have ever had. The balance of malt to hops really makes this an enjoyable drink for me."
"O - Such a big, nasty DIPA, just dripping with pungent hops. Perhaps a bit too big for my taste lately, but still quite well done!"

"Loved this beer, it will become a regular on my list. Just as good as Pliney the Elder or Ace of Spades!"
""
"Overall-Fantastic Double IPA. An DIPA made for those of us that love DIPA's. This is a classic west coast ipa. The citrus shines through more and is better balanced than many West Coast DIPA's I have had. It might just be the homebrewer in me but one of the things that I love about this beer is that it has at least 5 varieties of hops and some are used for both bittering and aroma."
"Cost: $8.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
"This is an extremely good DIPA. You don't feel any of the alcohol and while it is a very hoppy beer, it isn't in the way too much category either."
""
"O- this is a great beer. Another thing I love about it is the price. I have had many other big DIPA's that cost so much more that offer so much less. I got this for 5 bucks- and usually see them for 7. Probably the best DIPA out there for this price. I've had this multiple times, but just got around to rating it. It is my fallback when I don't feel like experimenting with something new and want to get something I know I'll love"

"O - The flavor is much like their Union Jack only moreso. I prefer the Union Jack because it is less sweet (and alcohol laden) but this is a fine DIPA."
""

"Overall is excellent! A solid DIPA from a top notch brewery."
""

"Pours a translucent golden orange with a moderate but lasting head and moderate lacing. Powerful citrus hops smell - pretty much the definitive IPA smell, as far as I'm concerned. Tastes of citrus-y hops, with a clean, lightly sweet background that balances it well. If I weren't told of the ABV I would have no idea it was as strong as it is. An excellent 2IPA."
""
""
"Golden color slightly hazy thick head with good retention and some lacing. Smells amazing citrus and pine aromas. Slightly sweet has a huge hop prescence. Good mouthfeel....Can't tell almost 10% at all. One of the best DIPA's around from one of the best breweries around"

"I'm a big fan of beers favoring the citrus hops. One of my favorites, and glad its come to the Chicagoland market."
"O - Good balance, nice range of hops, easily drinkable for the ABV, overall I would definitely get this again."
"Poured into my DFH glass a very nice cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, with a very nice thick one-finger creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy with some malt notes, lots of citrus and pine notes. The taste is sweet, hoppy, slightly malty, very nice citrus/pine notes. Medium body, with a nice bitter/dry finish. This is a very nice DIPA, glad to finally try it and it's here in Utah."
""
""
""
"This has a fantastic bouquet of pine and grapefruit. Very floral. Some sweetness, a little chew, a touch of pine. It’s amazingly light and quaffable for a strong DIPA, deliciously so. Called “the nectar of the gods” by someone who took a sip, and I’m borrowing that phrase because it’s so apt. Wow."
""
"O: Not bad, a little light on flavor but well balanced. Definitely a solid beer if a bit lacking. I like my stuff to be hop heavy but this one shouldn't disappoint."

"Double Jack, while not the “hop bomb” as labeled, it is most assuredly not a sessional that requires a speedy resolution."
""
""

"O: A delicious, highly drinkable (and accessible) DIPA. A must try for any hophead, and considerably more complex than its little brother (the Union Jack)."
""
""
""
"O - An really solid DIPA from FW. While this isn't my favorite DIPA, it's up there. I love that I can get sixers of this stuff. Nice and balanced but you still get plenty of hops."

"This is will say is one of my favorite IIPA's! Huge notes of pine resin and mouthwatering hops that seem to stick around the nose forever. This pours a nice and deep orange color that is a bit deep for my personal taste. As soon as the smell hits you, you know you have found the right beer. Taste is of pine, apple, pineapple, light wheat,warm spice. This is one of my top IIPA's. Highly recommended."

"Double jack is another example of a great Cali IPA with bright citrus flavors, mostly grapefruit, and a finely tuned balance of hoppiness and alcohol content. Pours slightly dark orange with a moderate head and an almost overwhelming fruity aroma, double jack has a wonderful balance of bitterness, citrusy hops, and the high alcohol content of a DIPA. Served fresh on tap in an IPA glass, double jack is a very enjoyable standout ipa from firestone"
""
""
""
"Overall: On the pricey side but totally awesome for an occasional treat. It's Not as hop forward as Pliny but definitely provides a wide range of flavors. Plus, it's a Firestone beer so it has no flaws."
"This beer looks great and smells great but the very apparent alcohol taste keeps the hops from truly shining. That being said it is still a very enjoyable sipper. Sometimes its nice for a great big beer to taste like a big beer. I will seek this out again."

"The smell is amazing, the citrus hops jump out of the cup. Blood orange/burnt orange in color. The citrus hops jump out on the taste too. grapefruit, orange, pine, come first. some malt came second, and then finally the hops left a bitterness lingering around. it seems like it got slightly thinned out by the 9.5 abv."

"Pours orange-copper with a medium head. Great floral hop aroma -- citrus and pine. Taste is the same floral hops with a nice, balanced malt backbone. The pine flavor (and an almost earthy flavor too) comes out even more as the beer warms up. Smooth, drinkable mouthfeel, maybe a little sticky at times but that's understandable given the malts needed to balance the strong hop flavor. All around, a very solid DIPA."
"Nice find. This one comes together over time. Worth a shot."
"I will say though, that despite the muddied flavor from the multiple hop varietals, that it really seems like the brewers were trying to go somewhere with it, unlike Bell's Hopslam, which lacks any and all direction in the hop department."
"Wow- this is incredibly juicy and sweet. The finish dries up a bit with some bitterness. Alcohol stays incredibly well-hidden. Mouthfeel is slick without being sticky. The complexity of this beer encourages me to take my time, but it's not overbearing at all. Would guess that this bottle is not incredibly fresh, and I'm sure this beer is even better when it is."
"O: Dangerously drinkable for 9.5% It's balanced, yet assertive. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for newer IPA enthusiasts, as it is pretty intense. It's an above average IPA, but probably not my favorite. Solid B+."
"Pretty good, but not near the best I've had. The finish is a little bit murky for me. You can't go wrong with this one, but better West Coast DIPA's exist."
"Ran into a couple of fresh ones while in PA, the 1st bottle I had was definitely old. One very nice DIPA I'd buy anytime, but like most in this style it needs to be fresh."
"Wish we had it it NC. This is a great DIPA and if you read my reviews, I am not a big IPA fan. I loved it!"
"Every day, I could drink this beer... It would be as go to DIPA were it available in my state..."
"This is a delicious beer and one I wish I had readier access to."
"O- After having a few beers from Firestone, this has been the most disappointing one so far. This bottle is a few months old, but there is just way too much sweetness in this DIPA. I will have to revisit when I see a fresh bottle, but Union Jack is much better IMO."
"O: outstanding DIPA, smell is among the best of any offering for this style, now, if only I could find this as 4x12oz..."
"First off, I was surprised how sweet this IPA was compared to others. Somehow though, it was perfectly balanced with the huge hop presence throughout the whole beer. A pretty good body rounded out the whole experience for a really solid IPA that sets itself apart from the crowd."
"Note: Would be an A bordering on A+ with a slightly different hop profile. As it is, the pine is a little overbearing on the palate."
"I will be buying more on my next trip to Illinois over Thanksgiving."
"D - A world class American Double IPA that I've been looking forward to trying for a while and that did not disappoint... Stellar aroma and better than good in all other categories... If there is any complaint it is that this one is a bit to harsh and a little rough around the edges..."
"Overall: A tremendous DIPA from FW. I'm so glad they are finally distro'ing there beers to Philly. I will definitely be drinking lots of their beers."
"O: This is my new favorite DIPA. It has excellent balance with a nice fruity citrusy taste that meets a fresh piney flavor. This is simply excellent."
"An awesome DIPA ... it's only rival I know of now is Myrcennary by O'dell."
"Overall, it doesn't quite live up to the hype for me. Sweet DIPAs are not my thing. I'd prefer the hops to steal the show, not get masked by alcohol and sweetness."
"The beer appears hazy and light orange hued with an inch of dense, white head. Plenty of lacing coats the walls of the pint glass. The aroma offers some malty sweetness, as well as some hop and citrus notes. The flavor brings forth a huge helping of malt and candied oranges. Strong. Hop presence is there as well, of course, but the flavor seems dominated by malt, candied oranges, and a sweet presence throughout. Thick in body, even a bit syrupy. Alcohol presence is prominent throughout. Overall, an ok beer, but not my thing."
"O: This beer on first taste became one of my top beers. It is distinct from Pliny and/or Blind Pig, which will remain my favorite DIPAS. However, this is a different change of pace, which is very nice. I will seek this beer out as much as possible and won't be disappointed."
"Overall: Very enjoyable brew. I have to travel to get this but I make a point to always have plenty on hand. This is one of my top 5 DIPA’s. If you can find it, it’s worth the effort."
"I'd buy this beer again in a heartbeat, especially if Nugget Nectar is out of season."
"Taste - Hoppy, but not excessively bitter. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, and pine are well-balanced by smooth caramel and biscuit malt."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light, and the finish is full. This is a wonder DIPA has great flavors and very easy a sipper on a chilly night, like tonight. Wonderful brew."
"O- I'm not super impressed that this is an older bottle. (It's my own damn fault for not checking) But when Buffalo NY finally gets FW for the first time I had to jump at it. With that being said, even at 4 months old it's still a excellent IIPA. Would definitely like to try a fresh bottle next time."
"The Double Jack is an amazing DIPA with very few equals. It has an amazing taste and does a very great job of being hoppy without knocking you over. Very well done and I will definitely search it out again."
"O: Very solid offering from FW. The flavors blended together nicely. I haven't been disappointed by any of their offerings yet."
"Overall a great DIPA. I'll definitely trade for this one again or pick it up if I see it."
"Mouthfeel: This beer feels to have a nice balance of thick and thin, the hops stick around nicely on the back of the tongue very nice finish."
"As an imperial IPA, it does well on its own. Its a good beer made from a winning recipe. But if I had to choose between this or Union, I'd go with Union. Its simply more balanced, but just as complex and tasty. Overall, not bad though and worth the buy, even if it is just to compare the two."
"Overall: Pretty damn good dipa highly recommended. Firestone is fast becoming one of my favorite breweries"
"Lots of folks are going to be hitting FW more and more because of its wins at GABF. This beer goes to show why they deserve that recognition. Delicious."
"First time trying this Double IPA and I'm very impressed. Where sometimes I'm overwhelmed with a tongue burn of some IPA's, this one is very drinkable and even refreshing! Whoever came up with the hop profile balanced everything perfectly in my opinion. The only thing I can pick on even a little is, my bottle didn't have that big aroma nose to it that I was expecting. It could just be this bottle, I'll buy ten more to find out!!"
"Enjoyable beer. A good DIPA, but not super memorable."
"Pours a clear and light copper body with a frothy 2 finger head that mellows out and sticks and laces around the glass. Big piny, and grapefruity notes followed by a sugary malt blast. Cat urine fresh cut grass, slight mango and or citrus fruits, and mellows with a warming alcohol touch. Big big hop presence on the tongue, subtle wet hops though not aggrresive at all. Sweet fruity taste and feel, extremely smooth and delicious, finishes with a semi bitter alcohol warming . Medium bodied, sweet, creamy and smooth DIPA thats easy to drink and leaves the mouth extra dry begging for another sip. Overall this is great stuff, i cant get enough of this taste. One of the best tasting DIPA's ive ever had."
"I've heard/read great things about this beer but it didn't quite live up to expectations. It really didn't have any aroma other than some caramel with a faint orange background. I'm thinking this beer has quite a bit of late addition hopping and dry hopping and i may have had a bottle with some age on it, diminishing those qualities. It was decent beer but a bit on the sweet side for me, drinking more like a light, malt-oriented barleywine."
"I bought a bottle to cellar for a year or two and see what happens."
"Overall, this IPA can improve in just about every area, but this brew is really near perfect. Thanks again to Chris and Matt Capone."
"O: Good drinkability and well balanced Double IPA that is sweeter than most."
"Just a fantastic beer. It got better as I rated it. I am a bit of a Firestone homer, but it’s hard not to be when their beers are so good."
"O- i have not had a hop bomb like this in a while. A refreshing DIPA that does not disappoint. I am so glad I was able to get a shot at this."
"M / O: Medium-full body, middling carbonation, smooth really. Tasty for sure, but breaks no new ground - just an above average West Coast DIPA. Depending on when and where you have this I imagine it could run the spectrum from sublime to just good."
"O - I loved this beer so much and could have sipped it all night. One of my new favorites."
"tons of hype about this beer, so i was stoked when i saw it at my local. poured into a pint glass, lots of lacey head here. nose is fruity with big big hops. its a complex taste, almost a little heavy on the sweet side, long evolving finish finally coming through with the hop bitterness. no doubt a worthy brew, but didn't live up to all of the hype. that said, i'd be very interested to try some of their other concoctions."
"22oz bottle. Pours a traslucent golden amber color with a small layer of head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is piney with tropical fruits. Smells sweet with a good amount of hop aroma. Flavor is more tropical/citrus fuits. Dry with some resinous pine taste. Has a nice warming alcohol flavor to it. Bitter tropical fruits at the end. Lightlly carbonated with somewhat of a creamy mouthfeel. This one has a nice balance of booze, hops, bitterness and tropical fruits. Overall, this is a real good Imperial IPA worth seeking out."
"O – Quite possibly my favorite DIPA, the character is BIG and yet so sublime, a must try for any hop head. Drinkability is a notch above any double IPA I’ve had, and overall character is so enjoyable to drink. Now on my regular rotation list. 4.5"
"Thanks to a buddy for sharing this with me. Pours a clear reddish/burnt orange with fluffy white head into a snifter. All I could smell and taste was oak, or something similiar to that. You could tell it was barrel aged, and thats ok with me. I picked up orange in the taste too with the oak. Drinks easily for the higher percentage. There needs to be more barrel aged iipas."
"This beer is a clear, golden-amber color with a short and foamy white head. Moderately low carbonation and nice tufts of lace. The beer has a brilliantly hoppy aroma. Loads of hop-derived citrus aromas dominate the smell. Orange peel and fresh grapefruit. Herbal, resiny, and fresh-smelling. The taste is intense and exceedingly well balanced. The first note is of the hop bitterness....it's a biting sensation...followed by an agressive alcohol warming and a deep malt flavor. Pale malts...no real roasted character...bread and toast. The hops are showcased in this beer, amazingly hoppy. The body is solid. This is not a beer to be taken lightly."
"Nice to find a DIPA that is not overwhelming. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"OVerall a very very sessionable beer that I will add to my """go to""" beers."
"O - One of the best DIPAs I've had. I really enjoy the malts playing a decent role other than carying hops and making it not hop tea. Great depth and complexity. Dry enough and bitter enough to still be a DIPA and not a hoppy Barley Wine. Tons of hop flavor and aroma. ABV is well hidden until you get back to work..."
"Overall - This is a huge surprise in terms of a double IPA, and well worth a try. It’s lighter than most DIPAs in all aspects - the sunny color, the high citrus/low resin nose, and the expertly hidden 9.5% ABV. It may lack bitterness, but only barely. This doesn’t detract from the pleasure that is the citrus and florals. I think even the most hardcore hophead could enjoy this beer - for what it lacks in bitterness, it makes up for in presence. The hops, bittering and onward, are pervasive and complex."
"Double Jack is a very tasty double IPA that drinks easily. I have had better, but I have had far more that are worse. This would certainly qualify as a beer that I would pick up from time to time if it was more readily available."
"Pours a great honey color, which was way lighter than I thought this was going to be. There was minimal head, due to a rather careful pour. Because of this, there was really no lacing. A piney and citrus scent is what I got from this, also a honey kind of sweetness as well. Taste is on the citrus side, I'm detecting peach, and orange rind. There is also a resinous hop bitterness to it. Mouthfeel on this one is a bit thick, leaving a hop oil kind if bitterness in my mouth. Its on the moderate side of being carbonated. I'd have to say that this is yet another solid offering from Firestone, definitely something I would get again."
"mouthfeel - smooth, good solid body, low to medium carbonation"
"Great Beer. A great example of the style, aprt from the nose being slightly muted, this beer borders on perfection."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my snifter. About $8 for the bomber. Really nice stuff here. Excellent color with a silky white head. Nose has huge, fresh hops and sweet malts. The taste is well balanced with again a big hit of piney and citrus hops. Clean, crisp body is well carbonated. Would love to get a keg of this. Glad Firestone finally made it to Colorado!"
"The nose is a potpouri of sweet pine and grapefruit. The beer is juicy and full of sweet pine, hints of pineapple, and lots of grapefruit, it finishes with lingering grapefruit. The beer is sticky, full bodied and well carbonated. A very nice DIPA."
"overall an OK DIPA but nothing super exciting."
"O - An excellent double IPA that is well worth trying if you are into the hopbomb kind of beers as I am. Definitely stands out among the pack of double IPAs I have sampled in the past few months."
"O: I like this beer: looks good, the nose is epic, and the taste is just barely off. There’s so many different incarnations of the DIPA, from the super-malty to the extra-hoppy, and I love trying them all. Double Jack wasn’t my favorite, but it was definitely a refreshing experience compared to the massive hop-bombs that this style tends to foster. Maybe I’d be happier with just the Union Jack; in that case, bring it on!"
"O: Started off being quite impressed but was saddened by how raw and off-putting the alcohol was."
"M: The mouthfeel is spot on for a big DIPA, oily and bitter with an effervescent boost from the carbonation. A nice find that I'm glad I dug into right away."
"O: Very nice offering from FW here. ABV is hidden very well, making this one a bit dangerous. Wish I could get it all the time."
"O - A hop bomb done right. Perfect blend of hops for an incredible nose, flavor, and bitterness, but doesn't just assault you with hops until you're sick of them after the second sip."
"O: A big, heavy DIPA. Unapologetic of its lack of balance. Recommened for anyone craving a big hop fix."
"Good beer overall. Aroma was amazing on it. No real signs of abv although the heavier mouthfeel hinted at strength. Not overly hoppy. Good balance."
"O: Not a bad DIPA, just not my fave."
"Awesome DIPA but it may not be worth the price tag. It's really good though."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip, no bottle date. Pours crystal clear orangish golden amber color with 1-2 fingers of a dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Some nice lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of huge orange, grapefruit, pine, caramel, and spices. Beautiful aromas here with big strength, this might be a fairly fresh bottle. Taste of huge caramel, pine, orange, grapefruit, spices, and a bit of tropical fruits. Nice amount of bitterness present on the finish with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, pine, and spices. Fantastic balance of bitterness and sweetness in this, nothing is overwhelming. Alcohol is practically invisible, only a very small warming on the finish noticeable. Medium carbonation and body, with a bit of a prickly and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable stuff, I am surprised how easy this is going down at this alcohol level(9.5%). Overall, this is an absolutely incredible DIPA with great balance of flavor and smooth drinkability."
"Feel more like a barley wine at times - but good nonetheless."
"Would be brilliant with blue cheese risotto accompanied with braised lamb."
"I hope to see this beer again very soon."
"The CPJ"
"Oversll- Kind of reminds me of Pliny but I don't really drink thast enough to say for sure. The sweetness prevents this from being just hop juice and for that I am grateful."
"Pours a clear, golden orange with a thick white head. Slow retention but worth it. Little lacing. Smells of citrus and pine, all hops,very nice. Taste is an earthy, bitterness followed by a nice sweetness with a dry finish. All in all very drinkable and worth the wait. Up there with squall from dFH as one of top double ipa's. I think the sweet cut does it for me. Can't wait to try more styles from firestone."
"Overall: A solid IPA. A must for dIPA drinkers."
"An amazing showpiece, but you wouldn't want it on a regular basis."
"Overall: And enormous double. Complex and unabashedly unbalanced."
"Cheers!"
"O-My first FW brew, have a Parabola in the cellar that I can't wait to crack open. Local store has their porter and it looks like I'll be picking that up as well."
"Surprisingly easy-to-drink ale with a mouth feel that is a bit dry all the way through."
"Will purchase again. Pretty potent due to ABV."
"O- This is a good beer and I am enjoying it, just thought it was going to be better. This isn't a bad DIPA, I just think it is too malty for me."
"overall, a very solid beer, slightly different than most DIPA, reminds me a little bit of nugget nectar."
"Nice light finish with long lingering flavor is superb."
"D: Double Jack is a very good DIPA, but it's my opinion that it performs slightly better on draft. Would gladly pay for either serving again."
"Overall: It's alright. As far as DIPA's go, it's not my favorite, but it's a beer I would drink again. I've had it on tap in Worcester, MA and it's a lot better that way. Like I said, the age of this beer definitely killed it for me. I wish I had reviewed the Double Jack I had on tap. When I have it again, either a fresh bottle or on tap again, I will definitely edit my review."
"This is a very good DIPA. I'm afraid that the bitterness seems lower because the bottle may be a bit old, but perhaps that is jsut the way this beer is. Either way, I find it very tasty and would recommend it to any fan of craft beer."
"98."
"This certainly brings the yum.."
"Mouthfeel: Well carbonated, slightly thin but not lacking, sticky and gooey, clings to the mouth and tongue. Delicious."
"O/D: Not what I expected from a California DIPA, not as hoppy as I wanted it to be, too sweet at times, and it was on tap. Still worth a go."
"O- Exactally what I would expect from Firestone Walker! Unreal balance, excellent carbonation, sweet, bitter and fruity!"
"Overall: As far as Double IPAs go, it’s quite good. The taste leaves something to be desired, as I would have liked a bit more citrus notes, and the water-like clarity leaves me rather befuddled. It looks too perfect. Aside from that, I think it is a solid beer."
"22oz bomber into pints. Pours a clear copper/orange with a nice soapy foam and lace work on the glass. Aroma is of pine, citrus, and sweet malts. In the taste, more of the same, bitter hops, pine, resin and honey like malt that adds quite a bit of sweetness. Medium bodied feel and alittle chewey. The balance of this beer can best be described as two opposites meshed together, big time sweetness and tons of citrusy bitter hops. West coast style IPA, big, abrasive, and is not intended for the faint of heart."
"On tap at taproom no.307 nyc poured into duvel globe. Pours deep orange with a sizeable white head. Smells like moldy basment, but in a good way like you can tell some serious hops await. Tast is lots of piney hops as expected, something seems off though it seems to lack ab malty balance. Carbonation and mouthfeel seem about right for the style. Overall pretty decent IIPA but not life changing."
"Alcohol is well hidden, although it does serve to thin out the body on the end. Carbonation is perfect methinks."
"In the end, I was hoping for more citrus, and that may have escaped the beer as it sat for 3-4 months. But this was still enjoyable and I'll get it again at some point."
"Overall: I'd say that its slightly less good than the hype, but, dude, it really is a killer beer. I would have liked to seen a stronger presence of the sweeter and earthier tones to balance the hops even more. I think thats the difference between really really good and masterful. I will drink this again FOR SURE whenever its to be found. One of my current favorites. I think its every bit as good as Ale Mucho Hoppo from Charleville!"
"O: Definitely a very good beer, but best for hop fans. Almost a bit big for me."
"O: very tasty IPA, would love to try a fresh one, and more from this brewery."
"Had this on tap, but in a plastic cup, at the Oregon Brewers Festival in Portland a few weeks ago. Appeared more distinctly ornage in color than many other IPAs that day. This beer smells and tastes strongly of alcohol, and almost leaves a stickiness on the lips. It is truly a hop bomb like many of its California brethren. I liked it a lot, but could not drink too many of these at a sitting (beer fests in ONW excluded, of course)."
"OVERALL: This is a quality Double IPA and with its distribution expanding, especially to the Chicago Area, I think we will start seeing this beer gain more and more traction in the beer community. I'm guessing it will be on the front page of DIPAs on Beer Advocate sometime next year. It is very drinkable and accessible, but still robust and complex enough for a BA to thoroughly enjoy."
"There are many other DIPAs I'd rather get than this one. It's the west coast and there is stiff competition. Not bad, but I don't think I'll seek this one out again. Try this if you like 90 Minute from DFH."
"Overall: A little more malt in the background might have smoothed things out a bit, but that's just nitpicking. I really enjoyed this one and am very likely to have another in the future."
"I sat outside with my neighbor and we had nothing bad to say about it outside of that little alcohol heat."
"Overall a good beer that traveled well compared to others I picked up at a St Louis Whole Foods. However, I bet its a while lot better close to its home."
"Overall, a monster onedimensional hop bomb. This is much more bitter in the bottle than on draft. This and the Union Jack remind me a lot of Odell's IPA - very similar flavor profile."
"overall, a world class DIPA IMHO. probably my favorite to date. just love this stuff."
"This stuff is really good, one of the best DIPAs I've had. Will have to seek out more beers from Firestone Walker."
"Finally got my hands on a Firestone Walker Double Jack. This is a fine DIPA. Great smell, exceptional taste. Crisp, hoppy mouthfeel and taste. Poured a light orangish color with two finger head that slowly dissipated. One of my fave DIPA I've ever had. Great beer."
"Overall: A nice example of a well constructed DIPA as all flavors compliment each other. Slow sipping and a great beer to split with a friend."
"Drinkability- This is an excellent DIPA. I recommend this to all hopheads."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable DIPA, very flavorful with only the slightest touch of alcohol being felt."
"D - Not tiring, but ABV kills the drinkability issue."
"O-I find this to be an excellent extremely enjoyable beer. That I will be happy to visit time and time again."
"Poured a 22 oz. bottle (dated 3/14/11) into a standard pint glass, purchased at Super Deli Mart (Seattle, WA) in July. Although a bit dated based on FW's recommendations (110 days from bottling) this beer has a nice clear pour with above average carbonation and left a great lacing pattern. Smell maintained good fruit and taste and had an as expected heavy hop profile. Above average malt flavors help to subdue some of the 9.5% alcohol, but tend to leave a long, lingering aftertaste. Overall, this is a quality offering from FW and one that I'd like to keep as a regular in my fridge."
"Poured into a standard pint, this is a pale golden beer with a small head. The nose is... extremely citrusy... bordering on """new extra-lemony lemon fresh pinesol""". It treads the border with """too much""" but doesn't quite go over. The flavor is very sweet, balanced by very high bitterness, and a vast quantity of citrus hops. It just doesn't blend together very well, and does not make a particularly good beer."
"Taste: Really nice taste with the citrus and mango upfront balanced by the maltiness of a really solid IPA."
"Very drinkable but slightly on the heavy side. It is a big beer but a very polished big beer."
"O: this a great dIPA that I look forward to having again, I'm so very glad this brewery came to MD finally. First beer of there's and I'm already looking forward to the next."
"O: Very one-dimensional in hop character (I guess since it should be) that comes through very cleanly. Remarkable balance for DIPA since just a bit of sticky resin lingers. No real faults in my book. Just need to watch the ABV."
"Pours a clear amber color with a medium frothy white head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of big spicy, floral, herbal hops, citrus notes in the back end and a good bit of toffeeish and toasted malt notes. The taste is strong bitter herbal hop notes, strong citrus and candied citrus, toffeeish malts, floral notes. Well balanced. Strong lingering bitterness. Almost chewy. Medium-full bodied. Very nice beer."
"O - A very solid beer from FW, although a little one-dimensional it uses the hop combination very well. No visible bottle on date so freshness might be impacted some, but not enough to buy it again."
"I would say my biggest complaint here is the price point. But a well crafted and delicious brew to say the least."
"D: Overall a solid Double IPA- Wish I had picked up two! Will be seeking out other Firestone Walker products in the future."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose, flavor is same almost sweet grapefruit, dry finish. $8.75 for a 22oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"Overall I give this a 4.5 rating and have recently purchased a 1/6 keg for my kegerator. Thank you Firestone Walker"
"O - A decent, very well-balanced DIPA. Hops are certainly present but not quite as dominating as I expect in most west coast DIPA's. I am not saying that is a bad thing; just not what I expected."
"O: This is a wonderful IPA, instantly one of my favorites."
"Overall I must say that I really enjoyed this but, it's little brother Union Jack is better. This bottle was dated April 6th, so it's not the freshest example. If I can find a fresh example I will try it and change my scores if needed. A must try in my opinion!!"
"O - Excellent Double IPA, hitting high marks in all categories. I'd like to try one at cellar temperature the next time (This one came out of the fridge). I'm going to note this as an instant favorite and would recommend it to anyone who like complext but delicious craft creations."
"O: truly incredible, this goes right into my top 3 favorite ipa's, so nice to drink, the ABV isn't even close to noticeable. Purely awesome. My first beer from Firestone Walker and I will ensure it is not my last"
"Sweet, bitter, tasty, complex, very easy to go down. Thank goodness I don't have a growler of this or I'd be toasted; it would be all gone in my first sitting. Wait, would that be a bad thing? This screams -- I'm a Double IPA -- with the first sip! Alcohol is hidden very well. This is a very nice brew to celebrate National IPA Day!"
"A great Double IPA from Firestone Walker. Actually my first from these guys, and I'll definitely be back for more. One of the best double IPAs I've ever had."
"O - This has great drinkability. It goes down easy, and the flavor is very nice. I could easily have a few glasses of this in an evening. Overall, I think this is a very solid DIPA. I very much enjoyed it, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. I recommend picking this one up."
"o-another solid brew from Firestone Walker. Great example of a DIPA. Will be having this in the fridge as a main stay."
"The body is medium to full, and the carbonation is very well integrated. Overally, this beer is well balanced and enjoyable. I'm really excited that Firestone Walker has finally found its way to Philly."
"Thanks to Schmittymack for sharing a bottle of this one with me last night. Poured a medium golden color, with a decent ivory head. Aromas of hop resin, tangerine and grapefruit zest. Medium bodied, with flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and sweet malt."
"I'm really impressed by how smooth and clean this beer is. It's not necessarily the way I like my DIPAs, but this is about as good and drinkable as I could expect a sweeter DIPA to be."
"I can't give this beer a score of 5 because it meets all expectations rather than exceeding them."
"This beer is all about hops with almost no malt presence at all. Bitterness is big, but there's that lovely sweetness in the center to round things out. Seems more like an East Coast/VT IPA than a West Coast pine-bomb. Damn fine beer!"
"O: This is a pretty darn good beer. Not as powerful as most Double IPAs which I have to say was a bit of a disappointment, but at the same time, its really really drinkable with nice light and subte flavors that are very delicious."
"Drinking a fresh bottle courtesy of Goblinmunkey7. Still too sweet, too boozy. Very good, not top tier. I've reduced my scores slightly."
"O: if you're in the mood for a hoppy double IPA, this is a solid beer. The 22oz bottle set me back $8, which is not bad. Compare that with the Dreadnaught, which was $12."
"I will try to get this beer anytime I trade. Thanks to CarolinaKevin for getting me started on this beer!"
"The best IIPA I've had to date. Not enough O's in """smooth""" to describe this. The hops to bite your nose off, but they're there. Tastes NOTHING like a 9.5% ABV beer. I have another bottle and can't wait to dig in. Highly recommended beer."
"This is quite a good DIPA. I love the juxtaposition of sweet and sour notes and the finish is remarkably long."
"Edit 12/18/11: Had a bottle immediately after my friend made me try some """legal""" bud, which messed up my palate. The beer tasted bone dry and full of bitter grapefruit pith and hot alcohol. Like white grapefruit aerosol hairspray with a hint of caramel. I was so turned off."
"I love this beer... Perfect after a hot day. The beer pours a clear amber color with a finger of extremely aromatic foamy white head that laces well. The aroma is pungent with piney hops. The taste starts with a perfect balance of piney notes and caramel sweetness... An then finishes bitter, but not too bitter. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced. Overall an amazing beer."
"O - Smells good, but just too sweet."
"O - This is a really well-balanced, tasty DIPA from FW. The appearance could be a bit better, but this may be a product of this particular bottle's age (no date listed)."
"D-very good. nice and complex. very different from other beers within this style"
"Overall - Really tasty and smooth for a double ipa. Has ample amount of everything you want in a dipa. Nothing is overpowering but theres enough alcohol to limit you to a glass or two. Really enjoyied this, worthy to search out."
"Very solid."
"Poured copper color with a large frothy white head that was mostly lasting with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy sour citrus west coast hop and fruit aroma. Medium to full body with slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy smooth bittersweet citrus flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration.This is a standout beer."
"The taste follows suit, an incredibly balanced beer with lovely malt undertones propping big booming hop flavor. Citrus and floral notes abound. Booze is restrained as is the bitterness. Truly top notch DIPA that buries the boozy, bitter messes of so many other brewers. Totally delicious and drinkable. I had to pace myself here....at 9.5 ABV I quickly got sloppy. Really hard to stop drinking this one."
"O: I've had this a few times. I really wish I could get this around here because I really enjoy it every time, in fact I think I enjoy every FW beer every time. Any DIPA that tastes this fruity and has adequate bitterness left at 3 months old is ok in my book."
"Cheers..."
"D: For almost a 10% beer, this is surprisingly drinkable. If I lacked even a little self-dicipline, I'd just drink this all day long."
"O: Fantastic dipa. as usual, I could go without the simcoe, but it is judiciously used here. Amarillo really tied things together, keeping this beer from smelling like someone peed all over a rug. Then again, this is just, like, my opinion, man."
"I'd gladly pay $22 for another Firestone 14, but I can't imagine spending $8 again for another bottle of Double Jack. While Firestone Walker is undoubtedly one of the best Californian breweries, their DIPA comes nowhere close to touching the state's best examples. Sure it's a little more approachable than most in its style and in many another parts of the country it would be a godsend, but here in CA it doesn't quite make the cut."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with a bit of kick from the alcohol. Overall, I'm really enjoying Double Jack as a firm reminded of why hop-bombs are so damn tasty. Plenty of American hop flavors to keep you happy and a good malt presence to keep things in check."
"Overall this is another very good, though not quite great, DIPA from CA. Well worth a shot."
"I dunno, was a decent DIPA, but the alcohol was very detectable and distracting. Tasted pretty fresh, which is always a plus...and glad I got to try this west coast offering, just not something I would actively seek out again."
"O - Am VERY impressed with this one and after having a lot of the """big dark FW beers," this one is a breath of fresh hops."
"The taste follows the nose initially. There are ample yet balanced fruity hops that dash across the palate, they soon switch to a pleasant caramel/biscuity maltiness. The finish returns to hops but more flavorful; they slightly linger/bite the tongue. This is a really hopped beer but not a hop bomb thanks to the balanced maltiness. When I say hoppy, it is a really equally hop flavorful as it is bitter so it avoids being a palate wrecker. This is one of my favorite Double IPAs, so glad FW has finally made it to the east coast. This brew is really delicious overall, the definition of PERFECTLY balanced and a treat to find on draft at a local spot."
"O- Terrific beer, great brewery, and it's affordable."
"Overall, a nice DIPA for someone who doesn't normally go for that sort of thing."
"Overall. Fantastic dipa. These guys have nailed the west coast dipa, in my mind anyways, and are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, this beer is much lighter than I was expecting. The beer is a amber-tinted gold color, and it carries a massive, frothy, light, big bubbled 3 inch head that eventually breaks up and settles into a managable half inch film. The beer leaves a great lacing along the glass as the head settles, and also while you drink it. The nose is all fresh hops; spicy and resinous, aromatic and green, the hops smell like they were dumped in by a front-end loader. Buried beneath the green, there are a healthy dose of citrus-grapefruit aromas, as well as a light peppering to balance everything out. Much less malty on the aroma than most DIPAs, which is fine by me. The beer's flavors are round and robust initially, with a healthy showing of smokey malt sweetness and presence, quickly cleaned up by the drying and astringent hops presence, both fresh and floral, with a cedar and fresh-cut grass character that overtakes the palate. Aftertaste is where the citrus notes come back into play, helping to cleanse the palate and balance out the strong hoppy display. The finish is remarkably quick compared to the robustness and amount of flavor profiles, and it only slightly dries the mouth, leaving just enough flavor behind to beg for more. Extremely tasty and hoppy beer. Not for the weak of tongue."
"This is a fantastic DIPA - has the rare combination of extreme hop flavor while retaining superior drinkablility. I paid 7.25 for the bomber (near the shore), and it is easily worth every penny."
"O-Good beer, would definitely drink again but kind of pricey i would say for having no extreme wow factor...still a good brew..."
"Overall: Finally got to try some Firestone-Walker and so far I’m impressed. It’s disappointing that I won’t be able to have anymore unless I trade for some. This is one of the better DIPAs I’ve tried."
"Overall Impression- As this was my second beer from Firestone Walker, I was impressed with the strength and right on style for this beer! So far, I'm a huge fan of this brewery. For the style, easy to drink and this made it such a great beer! Will be enjoying again (but only 1 in a night!)."
"O: A very solid beer...however. This brew was just lacking a certain """it""" factor that I was looking for. Maybe I served it at too cold of a temperature. I'll have to give it a 2nd look and see if it was just me. A solid offering worth trying."
"Thanks man!"
"Overall- This is a keeper for sure. It all works great together. And a DIPA that doesnt kill your palate and feel challanged to finish the bottle is always a welcome beer. A great example of the style that I would use to break someone new into the DIPA world."
"1349"
"A light clear copper color with a big white frothy head and gobs of lacing. The aroma offers bubblegum-pine hop with subtle malt underpinnings. The taste brings sweet pine hops and more bubblegum juniper just like the aroma suggested. Syrupy and a bit cloying with green bitterness and pineapple edges. Really quite a treat with a near full body and tastefully carbonated for a midland feel. Fair drinkability and highly recommended."
"O-definitely a good IPA, but i personally think that there are so many better options for less money.it also has no uniqueness to it. its still good and easy drinking though, but not a must try in my book."
"O- I love IIPA's that are well balanced and this one is spot on. Has just enough malt to balance out the bitterness from the hops. Hits the spot and is extremely refreshing. Can't beat it for this price point and easy availability. Looking forward to trying more FW brews."
"O: maybe it was the fact that there haven't been any other good DIPAs released in the past month or two here, or maybe it was that the preceding beverage was """only""" a pale ale, but whatever the reason, this is a standout beer. One of the better DIPAs I've had. Snag it if you can experience it as fresh as this was."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the interplay between the sweet aspects and the bitter aspects of the flavor. While the nose predicted a sugary and juicy brew, the taste followed through with a bit of a changeup. At first there was some nice bitterness, but as the beer warmed and opened up, it gave way to a sweeter, more delicate flavoring. As a whole, this beer maintained simplicity, yet incorporated some complexity in the hop profile, keeping you guessing, and satisfied, throughout."
"O: Being that it's quite muggy here in Philly today, this one hit the spot. A great beer. One of my favorites from FW. Definitely worth a try, especially if you're a hophead. I think I need to go brush my teeth now because the hop bitterness is wearing away my enamel."
"Overall a beautiful brew, loved every ounce of it."
"A great buy for $4.99 (Update, Store realized underpricing and raised to $7.99. DAMN!). Same price as Pliny but 100x's easier to find."
"O - Very good imperial its an achievement to have something that weighs in above 9 percent to be so damn drinkable."
"Overall, I would not pass this one up if I saw it sitting on a shelf. I would return to this over and over. To me it is not far away from Hopslam or Abrasive. I feel it is a step below Pliny the Elder. Still I would buy this again in a heart beat."
"First sip does not disappoint. Medium high carb hits at the start provides the hop blast that I like in my IIPAs. No boozy heat, and the finish is heavier with just a notch too much lingering sweetness for my palate. Nevertheless, this is a fine IIPA that earned every bit of a 4.5 review."
"Overall I'd say this one is a hit. I think it's my first from this brewery, and certainly cries out """give me more!""""
"O: Overall a solid Double Ipa , I enjoyed the way it was balanced between the hops and malts neither one out weighed the other and left a good aftertaste . Would have again."
"O: A top notch DIPA. A fairly easy drinker but the 9.5% sneaks up on you quickly."
"O - Overall, if I had to do a blind side-by-side tasting, I'm not sure I could discern between Double Jack and Hopslam. I loved this beer. Truly a world-class IPA, not a hop bomb but perfectly balanced and quite complex. Keep it coming FW."
"Notes - I admit, I expected more adventure from this beer, but I am not disappointed. What I thought was goign to be a bold deviation from the style ended up being an extremely solid albeit off centered DIPA. The sweetness was not expected but pretty nice."
"O: This is a really tasty beer, especially if you lean toward the heavier, sweeter, citrus and honey side of the tasting tracks. I could use a bit more punch from either the carbonation or bitterness to dial back the sweetness a bit."
"4.0 D: Good beer, but it's in a weird state between a dry, hop-bursted west coast DIPA and an east coast malt fest. Surprisingly bready for a non-bottle conditioned brew, but clean."
"Very drinkable and dangerous double IPA that can really sneak up on you"
"O- Really nice IPA. Hops are nice and make their presence kown. Smells unbelievable even when fresh out of the fridge. Cant wait to smell it warm. MASS is new to FW, and I was expecting a well balanced IPA, opposed to a great west coast IPA."
"22oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. No dating indicated on the bottle. Pours a pale reddish-orange with a translucent clarity. Head was half an inch, creamy/foamy and off-white. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a dollop of white in the middle. Some spots and strands of lacing are present during the tasting. Nose expresses co-mingled aromas of sweet citrus and bitter rind with a slightly piny character towards the back. Taste follows nose - backbone is quite malty and the bitter/sweet dyad is nicely balanced. Additionally, there's just a trace of ethanol towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium) with a slightly oily consistency, and a carbonation level that falls just short of prickly. There's also some residual alcohol heat that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. A really nice DIPA with great balance and very approachable at $7.99 a bomber. Would love to see this in issued as a four pack."
"O- Fruity, hoppy, smooth and rich, this is quite a nice beer to drink, and I'd be happy to get a hold of this again for enjoyment. The alcohol is so well hidden...I'd never know it's 9.5% other than from reading the label. A real pleasure to have....I'm really starting to dig these IPAs....I guess enjoying something of very high quality will help in this area!"
"Overall, a bit too malty for my liking. It is very hoppy, but also very malty. Not my favorite dipa."
"This beer poured out as a really nice looking copper color. The head was only about one finger in thickness but it left a great lacing from start to finish. The smell of the beer was wonderful, it had a great aroma of pine and citrus just exploding out of it. The taste was just about as good as the smell. Lots of piney sharpness along with some citrus fruits in the mix. Mouthfeel is oily with a bit of thickness to it. The beer just glides along the tongue though. Overall it's a great DIPA, very happy to have tried it!"
"Mouthfeel is good, closer to medium bodied but on the lighter side. Initial sweetness with a sharp, clean bitter finish. Perfect carbonation level and extremely well balanced and drinkable. I'm digging this. My first of hopefully many Firestone Walker reviews!"
"I really feel like this beer should be served in 12 oz bottles. I really enjoyed it at first, but I had a tough time getting through the whole bomber -- think it took me about 6 hours to casually sip my way through it. It's quite taxing on the palate, and my tastebuds were thoroughly wrecked by the end of it. """Too much of a good thing""" maybe."
"Overall - I literally have never seen this beer in stores before, and I LOVE the fact that my son bought this for me, so I may be a bit biased :) Truly, this is a VERY GOOD DIPA, and one that must be tried. If you hanker for a high ABV hops bomb then """this is your Huckleberry""" - you Will Not be dissappointed. If your looking for a strong malt backbone (sweetness) to counterract the dryness and bitterness, look elsewhere - this is all about the hops. But if you crave wonderfully bitter hoppy nuances that are not commonly experienced in other DIPA's, this is a treasure - mint and basil? It's here! For everyone, definitely not. But for a DIPA with some great depth and complexity, this is a must try."
"22oz bomber purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a slightly hazy golden body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smells amazing - grapefruit, orange pith, mint, grass... An assault on the taste buds - almost too much going on but in a good way. Orange, lemon, grapefruit, pith, mint, fresh-cut grass, several things I can't quite put my finger on, with just enough caramel and toffee to support the hops. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Definitely a sipper but each sip invites another. Wow. One of the most unique, complex, and in-your-face DIPAs I have ever had in my life. Glad to see these guys getting distribution in NH now."
"O: Really, it's hard to argue this as not being a solid IPA; everything about it is good. It's also hard to see it as being truly great, though. The appearance, taste, and smell all seem to have the same character, and that character is truly just double union Jack. As double Jack, it's hard to beat it up for accomplishing double all of the characteristics of Union Jack, but I feel a little sad that FW didn't go beyond simply that. If you like Union Jack, you'll probably like this twice as much."
"O: There's a lot good about this beer and there's some things that are great. The taste is really on the money, and the mouth-feel is consistently on par with the menu. while your friend might be paying for this fancy meal, be sure to contribute towards a good tip. This is after all a fine establishment."
"This is one of the best DIPA I have had. I wonder how fresh it is? I would love to try this stuff on tap out west freshly released. It could be close to Nirvana. This one ranks up there."
"this double IPA was pretty awesome. it's got a big malty introduction that quickly gives way to the hop bomb. shockingly drinkable at a monster 9.5% ABV. this would be regularly stocked in my fridge on the west coast. it seems that firestone walker is pretty good at this - mainstays that aren't standouts, but are just really good and should be kept around on general principle."
"The taste starts with a nice pop of hop resin citrus peel bitterness. The sweet malt lends a hand at countering the hops power. Imbueing strong toasted, caramel malts to the palate. With a syrupy palate, the brew finishes hoppy, bitter, and just enough malt to balance the hop aggresion. Not too mention the alchol adding some warmth at the end."
"O- This is a good beer, but for the price, and the fact that I can get others that I prefer more, for less, I probably won't revisit this beer. Glad I tried it."
"A double IPA that stays true to the style - big, complex and tasty. Even amongst the plethora of amazing IPA's coming from this California, Double Jack delivers memorable flavors."
"D- the tulip was easy enough to finish, and i ordered another one. very good DIPA to be able to buy year round for a moderate price. ill be looking forward to finding this on draft again sometime soon."
"O- It’s a solid DIPA, the malts were a little too present for my taste, alcohol is very present as well, still a quality DIPA."
"O: A fantastic beer. Really hoppy and flavorful but extremely well balanced."
"O- This is Bahl Hornin!"
"My research says this is hopped at the same rate as Union Jack but with a stepped up malt base. Not my formula for the absolute best of the style, but the bright hops, excellent craftsmanship, and price make it worth seeking out on multiple occasions."
"O - Overall it is brilliant. One of my favorite aromas, with a every balanced taste to match. Little booze for such a high ABV One of the best double IPAs, it deserves to be up there with the titans of the style."
"O- it's not Pliny, but it's a fantastic beer. Glad I picked this one up. 7.99 for a bomber seems like a steal"
"O - so glad to have nearby a must try for any hop head"
"Overall- very solid DIPA with such balanced floral, citrus, and piney flavors. Def would get again."
"D: Extremely tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very well-disguised 9.50% ABV kick, excellent representation of style, this beer is right up there with the best ones that I’ve ever had."
"Overall: Rating goes up because of the stunning drinkability. ABV is not evident. Double Jack is a bit of a one-dimensional take on the DIPA style; iit will not shatter the canon, but it works fine. I think I would take the single Union Jack over Double Jack for a nice IPA session…"
"Not an all out assault or anything just a nice IIPA."
"O: a great dipa, just piny enough but not too much grapefruit either."
"Overall this is a good beer. Is there better? Yea but this is a great beer. It takes hits for the yellow color and some booze smell and taste but overall I recommend this brew."
"I like that there is a malt taste in here that really reminds me of Dogfish Head 90 minute. All around this could fool me for a Dogfish Head beer actually. Some people say this doesn't have that much bitterness and yeah in comparison to others its not a bitter bomb but it does hold its own and backs up the hop flavors with that citric herbal and piney bitterness that we all love. Is it the best Imperial IPA ever? I'd say this, Dogifish Head 90 Minute and Hop Stoopid are some of the best I've had. This highly holds up to every Imperial in the style and maybe even ties for my favorite ever."
"O: A really really solid DIPA. Thoroughly enjoyed this one and would buy again. Stacks up strongly against the other West Coasters that are high on my list. Two thumbs up!"
"Overall, this is yet another great DIPA that can hold it's own against the over-hyped beers in it's class."
"O - Overall I thought this beer was more bitter than anything else, which is good for a DIPA but for me it can get a little boring. I thought it could of used a bit more fruity hop flavors, as well as a little more toasty, grainy malt. Other than that I think it looked good and smelled great, so I say give it a try for sure. Cheers!"
"O: This is a nice DIPA. 4"
"0- This is a fantastic DIPA, easily one of the best I've had in a long time, and it deserves a lot of respect, but not so much that I can't find it when I want it. A beautiful beer."
"Overall: An excellent double IPA. One of the best I've had."
"overall: great"
"Pours a straight on honey color into my Darkness snifter. A nice white head with scant lacing rests atop. Big citrus, pine and hop on the nose. This smells pretty good. Hop oil coats my tongue with my sip. I really dig on that. Taste is of citrus and hop mixed with a slight crushed aspirin character. I could do without that. The sip cuts pretty dry on the backend. This is a good beer but not overwhelming."
"poured a dark amber color with a off white head and no lacing. i could smell this as soon as the top was popped. smelled like christmas morning with big powerful pine hops, hard to pick out but there was some citrus and caramel malts in the nose as well. taste prettty much follows the nose with big pine taste, however there was no indication that this is a 9.5 abv as it was hidden well with the right amount of malts mixed in. went down easy with good carbonation and a dry bitter finish, which is what i expected when i first smelled it. cant wait to have another, i think i might cellar one for a little while to see if the pine calms down and doesnt over power."
"Many thanks to Alex (page101) for hooking me up with this on an awesome trade! Beautiful amber-copper pour with two finger head with great retention and excellent lacing. I could smell this from across the room after I poured it. Tons of citrus, most noticeably grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple with a solid caramel malt aroma as well. The head was extremely sweet and creamy on my first sip. The citrus is just as huge in the taste as it was in the smell with some additional pine with a hint of grass. A solid caramel malt backbone balances it out nicely. Excellent mouthfeel with a great creaminess and crisp, dry, bitter hop bite. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Couple that with the great mouthfeel and you have one hugely drinkable Imperial IPA. Another great beer from one of the most underrated breweries in the country."
"22oz bottle, not sure how old it was but maybe a couple months? Nice light orange color, a little lace, short head. Smell was nice but not a super hoppy west coast like I was expecting. It had a touch of alcohol but mostly just had a really balanced smell, a little malt and a little hops. The flavor was very similar, I think I caught a bit of citrus but it was not hop forward at all. the alcohol was noticeable but didn't detract from the flavor. I was actually surprised I enjoyed this as much as I did because I usually only like west coast hop bombs (which this may be when its fresh). Overall this was a nice balanced beer and just reminds me that Firestone Walker makes solid beers."
"OA: Excellent amber, heavy in character yet still well balanced."
"Easily one of the best double IPAs I’ve ever had! I am always looking for ways to improve beers so clearly I have a list of flaws here, but I should speak on the good points. Amazingly hoppy and the malt almost works as a way to keep the hops on the tongue longer."
"O-Very good brew and very drinkable. I put this one down a little too quick. Wish it was available to me."
"Poured into my dfh snifter- pours a transparent amber-orange color, a little head that recedes quickly, not much lacing. visible carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Smell- hardcore citrus, bitter hops, a little sweetness from the malt. Taste- immediate awesome peppery bitterness on the front part of the tongue, followed by nice thick carbonation, ended with a sweet, caramel finish. Incredibly impressive IIPA, very West Coast style. This is just very well made, precise with flavors. Mouthfeel- the carbonation is nice and rich and works well to keep this from being too sweet. Drinkability- for a 9.5%, this drinks incredibly smoothly. Impressive."
"Overall this is a great beer that I hadn't heard much of. I will be buying all their stuff from my southeast Mo. grocery chain store."
"Very well-balanced beer. Alcohol not at all noticeable."
"Overall - Nice balanced, enjoyed, alcohol well hidden. this was a fantastic share with SpinkRSX, thanks buddy."
"Nice IPA! Poured into a stem glass, a clear golden with brown shadows, moderately carbonated, with a half finger of creamy white head that receded to a thin layer eventually, and left some nice lacing. Great head for an IPA. Big citrusy hops in the aroma, and not much else noticeable. Big citrus hops in the taste as well, with notes of orange and grapefruit mainly; piney; also a subtle sweet malt background, but it's the hops that are primarily noticeable here. Light-medium mouthfeel, and very very smooth for an imperial IPA. Alcohol is well hidden, boosting the drinkability of this fine quaff even more."
"Thanks bbehr!"
"This is a bit too sweet for my tastes it gets into borderline drinking liquid honey, but it's got some great character I'll say that. I suppose though for tastes I was expecting a bit more variety also."
"O: The alcohol is hidden very well, it is quite drinkable. A great DIPA. I would definitely seek this out again."
"The first thing that struck me was the aroma of the beer as it poured into the glass. The hop aroma really jumped out of the glass. When I tasted it I expected a bit more hop flavor, but the malt sweetness balances the hop. It is a very well balanced DIPA, but a little on the sweet side for me especially as it warms. I enjoy the mouthfeel quite a bit and the beer beautiful orange hue with a finger of white head. Alcohol is well hidden and an excellent all around beer."
"Looks as if there is a bit of crystal malt in here, on the orange side of honey color. Well formed head that leaves a nice bit of lacing. This smells more like an American barleywine. Sticky thick hops, some citrus and tones of resin. A wave of bitterness followed by pine resin bomb, crystal malts, slight orange/grapefruit citrus flavor. Very thick on the palate and honestly rather cloying. In sum not my style of IIPA, too thick, but I can appreciate that it is a well crafted beer."
"22 ounce bomber. Pours a relatively clear light amber tinged with orange. Intense hop aroma. Pineapple and citrus dominate, backed up by sweet pine. Caramel malts are off in the background. My mouth is watering from the aroma alone. Taste follows the aroma, with a wonderfully bitter finish. Mango and pineapple tropical hops coat the tongue first, with spicy and pine notes in the middle. Relatively high carbonation combines with caramel malt sweetness helps to balance things out, and the mouthfeel is full and creamy. The ABV never really shows up, as the hops cover things up nicely. This is one yummy and refreshing double IPA. Highly drinkable, especially considering the high ABV."
"O- Overall one of my top 5 DIPA'S tried thus far on my beer journey, very nice, and I will be storing this and most importantly drinking this one again."
"Overall: The malt bill is big but the hops are slightly bigger; still, I prefer my DIPAs to be a bit more attenuated"
"Poured bomber bottled on 4/20/11 into my 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a ambery orange, with a 1 and half inch white head. Solid lacing. Smells citrus & papia. Taste is similar, with a hint of pine. Great mouth feel. Easy drinking for 9.5 abv. One of best DIPA in N.H."
"Overall, a nice DIPA. Its one of my favorite styles, so I have tried a ton of them, and this one is a very good example. I'm of the school that likes a little more balance in my dipa, not necessarily a all out hop-bomb, and i think this one fits that nicely. A pretty good beer, and at $8 or so for the bomber, not a bad buy. Would drink it again."
"Review #1500! Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. It pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, plenty o' leek, pine, dank greens, and light grapefruit peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with increased leek and some added light butter, insanely light sour cream, and a sharp sting of pine at the end. The body is at the lighter end of the medium spectrum, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a fairly solid DIPA, though the hop selection just didn't quite do it for me. The onion-i-ness and the pine-i-ness seem to battle it out with no clear winner, much to the detriment of my tongue. It isn't cataclysmic, but it keeps things from reaching potential heights of greatness and whatnot."
"Good, but this disappointed me. I enjoyed it more once it warmed but not my favorite hop flavors, and too sweet for my tastes."
"Poured a surprisingly clear orange gold color with a huge frothy head. Pretty sporadic lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma is super fresh and hop juicy with a lawn grass hint. Deliciously fresh and sweet hop flavor. Slick and oily feel. A deliciously hopped double. Not much in the malt department. Meh who needs it. Alcohol is barley detectable."
"For $7-8 a bomber this is a great deal. Big ups to Firestone Walker for bringing beer across the country at a more affordable price than 80% of the breweries from the East. I will have to try each of their beers as they arrive on this side of the country."
"I could drink this stuff all day and it's extremely inviting and superlative for its class of beer. FW is proving to be one of the best breweries on the West Coast."
"Overall - Mmm mmm good. I could have downed the glass in minutes, but I restrained myself. I so wish I had more of this. Not quite world class, but a very delicious substitute when world class isn't available."
"Pours a clear golden/copper color with a tightly bubbled white head that gets sticky. Pine and grapefruit pine and grapefruit. Little bit of tropical fruit and hints of malty caramel deep underneath. Curiously after a couple of sips the head disappeared and the aroma really changed. I get lots of pineapple and lemon with hints of alcohol. Taste is bitter and resinous with just enough of a bready caramel malt base to keep this drinkable. Finish is a bit dry with a long lingering resinous aftertaste long after each sip. Creamy oily mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation, medium to thin body. This is a big hoppy monster, bordering on harshly bitter. I enjoyed this I'm glad I got to try this, but I've enjoyed other DIPA's more."
"Poured a clear auburn gold with good head that dies slow and left lace pactches. Textbook piney citric hop aroma that is strong but with only hints of sweet caramel malt smells. I love the strong hops in this medium-bodied and almost smooth beer. Some balance as the beer maintains dryness thanks to crisp carbonation and also bread and caramel malt notes as well as a touch of sticky sugariness. Pleasant hint of tart fruit flavors like cherry or grape and I like that the ABV adds to a warming finish but doesn't bleed into the beer. Not a hop bomb but a balanced beer that still maintains a huge hop presence and is a good sipper."
"22 oz. bottle, served in tulip glass. Pours a clear golden color with a frothy, off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is a caramel maltiness, bread, a little bit nutty, big citrus, grapefruit, and pine hops. Flavor is caramel, grain, bread, a bit of wood, citrus, and pine. Mouthfeel is medium, syrupy initially but drying and bitter upon finish. Very good beer, well balanced, smooth drinker, clean."
"The mouthfeel is pretty nice. Despite the strong malt flavors, Double Jack is only medium-bodied. It's pretty smooth too; no harsh carbonation here. Overall, this is a pretty good double IPA. It has some faults, but it also has some flavor notes that are pretty killer. I hear that this beer is better in the bottle than it is on-tap, so I'll be sure to keep an eye out for a bottle of this."
"This is really well done. An excellent Double IPA that goes toe to toe with Pliny. Lots of hop flavors without the over barring bitterness that I get with so many examples. Something I highly recommend."
"Cheers."
"good body/oilyness to this beer. The flavor stays for a second then progressively comes off the pallete not leaving any bitterness. The mouthfeel is tough due to the high abv and explosion of flavor , it would be a difficult beer to session."
"Good IPA. Not as potent as other West Coast IPA's, but definitely drinkable. Definitely better straight from the tap and fresh as possible."
"This beer was an amazing IPA it leaves a lasting impression. from hops to alcohol. It started off with a thing 2finger foam. that left a good amount of lacing as it disappeared gratefully from the glass. As i was drinking it i was able to notice strong fruit wafts of pineapple and mango, and the mouth feel of this beer was wonderful. This is definitely a keeper."
"Overall this is a solid representation of the style and one I can buy right here at my local beer store. Welcome to NH Firestone Walker."
"This poured amber/reddish, hazzy with little to no head but produced a little lacing. The smell is grapefruit citrus and sweet fruits. The taste is sweet at first and then comes the hoppy bitter finish. This beer was just so smooth and refreshing to drink. Feel smooth and creamy in the mouth. Overall a great smooth and delicious beer to enjoy. Would have it on tap again and will buy the bottles now that they are available."
"O - Will seek this beer out. Does not distribute here, so I will have to trade to get it, but will most definetly try to get this beer as often as I can get it. A new favorite. If you like citrus, this is a great beer to try."
"Welcome to New Hampshire FW!"
"Overall, an amazingly good DIPA, and at a great price - I believe I paid $7.99 for the bomber at Binny's."
"Future outlook: Another Cali-snagged beer that I (sadly) won't likely get back to for a long while."
"O- A really good- close to great- DIPA. A lot of things really work in this beer, and it's very close to being world class. I really enjoyed this beer, and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy the style."
"O: The combination of fruit and pine is unique and very satisfying. The alcohol is not shy, but the overall impression is still very refined and enjoyable. I can see why folks like this-- I do as well, and it really comes close to 5's in each category. Need to pick up more on my next road trip."
"O - Overall a good DIPA, but I didn't seem to pick out anything to really make it stand out."
"This is a medium bodied brew that is modestly carbonated. Easy drinking with an awesome balance of flavors. I am super excited to see FW enter our market. However, regarding this particular experience leaves me a little perplexed. I recently had this brew from a bottle and was completely blown away by how awesome it was. Perhaps the """newness""" factor has worn off because the experience on tap was not as enjoyable as the bottle...which is a strange contradiction."
" Nice beer, will certainly drink this one again."
"O - this isn't a standout DIPA in my book, I've had many better. It was nice to try as I love firestone walker but taking price into account, there are many better choices and I probably won't be having this again."
"D- I look at the bottle and it inspires me to a suprising level of creativity. I'm glad to have picked up a few more for myself than I normally would have, to include grabbing a couple for a buddy. Another Home Run for Firestone!!!"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: This beer is light to medium bodied with very fine carbonation. Pretty smooth drinking. Overall, I'm much more impressed this go-around with the beer 2-3 months fresher. Great example of why IPAs should be drunk fresh. Hops are showcased very nicely."
"Cheers!"
"O - I really enjoyed this one. The taste was a bit of a letdown but the overall beer was very solid. It isn't Pliny but that is no problem. Thanks again to Matt for putting on another great event!"
"Overall - it money!! So creamy smooth like a stout but its a DIPA. I like!"
"O - Really not something I cared a whole lot for. Not bad, but not good."
"Overall I found this to be a little disappointing. Too sweet and not enough heft from the hops."
"Great taste. Very well balanced with sweet malts, hints of toffee, cadied nuts, and cereal then the citrus burst. Big and grapefruity, with sweet tart type flavors on the finish. Again mango, peach and some other pitted fruits. Nice amount of sweetness on the finish that gets nearly cloying after a few sips. Hmm still nice with moderate carbonation. A bit more carbonation could of helped cut that sweetness a bit. But otherwise tasty."
"O - This beer lived up to the hype/recommendations. A great IIPA that I will go back to in a heart beat. My only wish is to get it fresh from the source for comparison."
"O- This was a very good IIPA, glad I was able to try it, it was my first Firestone Walker brew, if they're all this good now I know what everyone is talking about."
"Overall: Fantastic! A very good brew that lives up to the hoppy expectation of its style, without overwhelming the palate. Hops is amazing. Overall the best of its style that I've tried."
"Beer hops on tongue"
"Overall: This is a great DIPA! I still enjoy Pliney and Hopslam more because these two beers are my favorites, but this beer will give them both a run for the money any time! Nice complex brew with alot of flavors."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich deep golden with a large fluffy white crown atop,multiple broken rings of lace left behind as it settled really slowly.A mix of overripe tropical fruit and pine resin hops and caramel malt in the nose,there is a sweet alcohol tinge to the aromas as well,the hops are big and so is the sweetness.Its close to being to sweet but the resiny hops come thru enough to keep it at bay somewhat...the hops are resiny and tropical in nature,the caramle base and sugary sweet alcohol is pretty hefty.Its better than alot of DIPA's because it is just dry enough."
"OVERALL: This is definitely a solid brew. Very flavorful and very enjoyable. It is obvious that this is the bigger, more robust brother of Union Jack, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better. The bigger, boozier qualities have overpowered some of the more flavorful and enjoyable hop and malt notes that make Union Jack so great. That said, this is more than worthy of the praise it gets, and I would gladly down another bomber of this stuff. Thanks again for the hookup STEG."
"Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. The 9.5% abv is well veiled. Not noticeable at all. Overall, a well balanced and delicious DIPA from Firestone Walker. I'm excited to have them distributing in Pennsylvania now and look forward to more Double Jack in my future."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. Honestly, with everything I've heard from this beer, I can't say I'm not a little disappointed with how this turned out. A strangely off-tasting note in the taste, the low carbonation... If you are looking for a West Coast hop bomb, turn elsewhere, and if you are in the Midwest or East Coast, you have an abundance of beers that could compete with this one."
"overall - very impressed with my first offering from firestone walker - price was very good 8 a bomber"
"It’s a DIPA on par with the best of them, yet it doesn’t wow me. In some ways, it’s old hat (though I’d certainly be complaining if it wasn’t up to this standard). It just seems like yet another huge hoppy ale crafted by another great American brewery (I've obviously gotten spoiled). It’s probably just my shifting preference towards lighter beers that is making me feel somewhat unimpressed by this. I’d certainly recommend it however."
"Overall a very nice beer but not as fully developed as a 120 or as hops-refined as a Hop Stoopid. Standout feature is citrus sweetness balance."
"This is a great west coast double IPA, really wish I could this in Ohio whenever I wanted it."
"O - This is a very good beer. I'd put this just a notch above Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA simply because this one is more balanced for the hop profile."
"Pours a rather luminous orangey-gold color with creamy white head. Nose is peachy, some tangerines maybe, and candied grapefruit. Palate offers some soft and forgiving bitterness, candied malt qualities, plenty of juicy fruit, and is very, very drinkable. ABV is masked well, so be cautious with this DIPA."
"Looks great after the pour. Crystal clear amber/orange with a fluffy, off-white cap and tons of clumpy lace. Good head retention. Hop aroma was evident as soon as the cap was popped and I wasn't disappointed when I went in for a more thorough evaluation. Powerful grapefruit and pine aroma, resinous and pithy, a little citrus juiciness too. Malt sweetness, sort of caramel and toasted, up front followed by sturdy bitterness and more citrusy goodness. Alcohol followed in the finish, both flavor and warmth. Really quite balanced overall with an appropriate hop dominance. Full bodied with some residual sugar and carbonation that was slightly low. Nice texture. Overall, I have no complaints with this beer. It's well made and tasty, easy drinking for a big beer with alcohol under control but not absent from it's character. Recommended."
"For a West Coast IIPA, the hop bitterness is mild. The hop flavor? Not so much. Big notes of piny, tropical hop resins cling to the tongue with a lasting imprint of medicinal booze that warms the stomach. Mouthfeel is close to syrupy, but thins out just enough thanks to the carbonation level to keep things manageable. All in all, a tasty version of the style from Firestone Walker. Then again, I wouldn't expect anything less."
"O: I like. If memory serves me correctly (it has been quite some time), this reminds me a bit of Middle Ages X Anniversary. I'll have to pull up that (ancient) review and do a """compare and contrast.""" Now that I think of it, this also reminds me of Stoudt's DIPA, in both color and sweetness."
"Good bitterness in the taste. Also, the alcohol is potent on the tongue--lots of wRmth in the swallow. Rich body, even oily from the alcohol, The aftertaste is like grapefruit rinds, but it is relatively short lived."
"D: Easy to handle ipa, only moderate alcohol consideration is detected from its 9.5% . Solid drinking ipa that is smooth,with warm toasty and warm pine hopping that is ample enough to satisfy the general hop needs of the people. Six pack worthy with a bomber going down quite nicely but to quickly."
" The flavor has an excellent amount of bitter and fruity hop flavor w/ mild tinge of orange and apricot w/ moderate spice and caramel element in the flavor from the malt w/ juicy effect from the hops which has a mineola tangelo taste and subtle green herbal accent with light toasted tinge as the Imperial IPA finishes with bitterness lingering slightly. I enjoyed this beer as it is a very tasty strong IPA overall I was very happy with sipping this gradually, would I have enjoyed it more had I not just tasted Ephraim from Hill Farmstead? probably, but that doesn't mean it is lacking, this is a solid beer in most every way."
"While not quite a top tier entry in the DIPA category for me, I was pleased to find that this lived up to the fine qualities of its predecessor, the Union Jack IPA. There’s lots of well balanced hop flavor here but I felt that the ABV was just a little too high to keep the approachability of this to where I wanted it. Still, this is a very nice beer though."
"D: Incredibly easy-drinker for its weight. Awesome."
"Overall: This fits well with the West Coast Double IPA's. Very drinkable and the alcohol is not that noticeable. Not sure when I will see this one again, but will order another glass when or bottle if I have the chance."
"This is a very drinkable DIPA and is very tasty. I wouldn't say it is my favorite in the style, but it is very solid. With some added complexity in the nose and taste, it would be an upper echelon DIPA."
"Pours a sunny copper with a huge head that falls away quickly, leaving big lacing and huge bubbles streaming up from the bottom. The aroma is strong and orangey, intense and sharp with an edge of pine. The flavor is also intense, sharp and citrusy, with pine and rosemary and an herbal bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and robust with a little prickle of carbonation. The alcohol is hot but smooth - you know you're drinking a strong beer, but it is not excessive or unpleasant."
"It's good for one time. I'd choose others before this."
"I recommend this beer. It is a little pricey, but I suggest picking up this gem."
"D - Another fine beer in the long line of quality DIPAs from the West Coast. Glad to see Firestone Walker making its way into PA!"
"22 oz bottle from Pinocchios, Delaware Co. poured into a Duvel tulip. Beer was an orangish/amber body with a two-finger, off-white head, nice lacing and decent retention. Nose was grapefruit, pine, caramel. Taste was mildly bitter orange, floral, pineapple, grapefruit with a sweeter middle before being followed by a nice interplay between the sweetness, citrus and bitternes in the finish. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium in body and carbonation with a pleasing bitter bite to break up the sweetness. You notice the alcohol but would have no idea it was 9.5%. All-in-all a good DIPA I would not hesitate to try again. Thanks FW for coming to Philly!"
"Hands down one of the top 5 IPA/DIPAs I've ever had."
"O-> Really a superb beer. Have enjoyed it several times and hardly have a bad thing to say. Ever. Really impressed that a seemingly filtered DIPA can be this good and tasty and still hold up after two months in the bottle and in the back of the fridge. Well done FW, well done. Curious about this being a summer seasonal or summer release, with a 2/10 bottling date but we all know these things are getting released earlier and earlier each year...but anyhow, I digress...don't change a thing FW!"
"HV"
"Served from a bomber dated 3/14/11 into a snifter. Two fingers of a bright white head from a gentle pour. Its noticeably clear. Reddish golden in color. Lots of citrus hops in the nose along with some tropical fruit notes. Biting citrus hops up front. Immediately made me think of fresh grapefruit. Floral hops and a mild alcohol taste in the finish. Left a watery lacing around my glass. At $ 9.99 per bomber I'll definitely be picking up more of this one."
"Overall, excellent. I'm glad these finally made it to the philly area. Will definitely be getting this one on a regular basis."
"I got to try a fresh bottle a few weeks ago. I poured it into a strait pint glass and it produced a three finger white billowy head that laced all the way down the glass. The body of the brew was a clear light liquid gold. The aroma was nothing but fresh hops right in your nose, nice and citrus’ with a light grassy note coming through. As for the flavor it was what I expect in a west coast DIPA, hoppy bitter with a light malt sweetness. Again the flavor is tilted towards the hops so the hop head in me was quite pleased it was crisp and clean in the mouth making for a really enjoyable brew to drink. I will be grabbing another bottle when I see it fresh again."
"Pours a perfectly see-through golden color with a really nice offwhite head. Smells of citrus hops and sweet malts. Smells pretty good. Taste is citrus hops, generic bitterness and also a pretty strong and sweet malt back. The mouthfeel is almost a bit too heavy sweet. Sticks all over the tongue, but carries the bitterness nicely through. Overall, this is good, but not amazing. I had it from the bottle right when it came out and remember liking it better, but I didn't review it so this is what it is. DIPA is a tough category to battle in, thats for sure."
"Not my favorite DIPA, but good nonetheless."
"Verdict: You should try it just to experience it...Not like you're committed to buying it again, right?"
"O - Overall this a a great balanced DIPA, Great flavor and smell, super for the style."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium with the oily hops present. Finishes great. One of the better DIPAs I've had."
"What can I say? The most complex, fruitiest DIPA I’ve ever tasted, and the fruitiest unfruited beer I’ve tasted since Stille Nacht 1996 Reserve. Among the detectable fruity esters, there are grapefruit, mandarin orange, tangerine, peach, plum, agave nectar, cherry, mango, kiwi, lemon, lime, marion berry, and strawberry. The finish is luxuriously long, and that seltzer quality slightly dries out the finish, and really adds a sprightly tingle. Add to this a great malt backbone that has a fruitiness all its own with a substantial body (similar to Hercules, but not as syrupy and weighty. The floral hoppiness in this beauty almost rivals the Plinys, and after awhile a seltzery saltiness develops, and while I’m not normally a fan of seltzer, it works perfectly here, and leaves one craving another taste. Perfection."
"This tastes like a wet hop ale, with the amount of oils. Gives it a great, viscous mouthfeel. The two different grapefruit flavors (sour and sweet) give it nice complexity. This is definitely one of my favorite DIPAs."
"Overall (4): I really liked this one a lot more on tap. The citrus was a lot more aggressive as it was presumably fresher. I will have this one on tap, but probably won't pick up too many bombers."
"This is a good Imperial IPA!!! Just enjoy it if you get it!!! You need to drink this. One of my favorites.."
"The beer is a huge inspiration to me as a home brewer and a pleasure to drink. I shared this fine beer with Beerformussel. We were not disappointed. Truly a fresh thirst quenching brew with a slight alcohol burn."
"O - A fantastic double IPA and beer for that matter. Try this beer."
"Medium bodied with a slick oily hops mouthfeel. Dank, dry and resinous with some nice bitterness that is quickly countered by a blast of sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Lots of grapefruit flavor with hints of mango, apricot and orange peel. This is countered by earthy, bitter pine needle flavor and a strong boozy presence. Subtle malt backbone with hints of biscuit and toast. As it warms the alcohol really starts to shoe and begins to dominate the flavor, making it a bit tough to drink down. Decently balanced at first but too hot for my liking."
"Firestone-Walker - Keep on staying damned sexy."
"SkÅL!"
"This beer I thought was excellent. Worthy to hang with the big dogs in my opinion.I reccomend this to any hop head."
"Another home run from Firestone Walker - right up there with PtE for me with all the right hop characteristics. It's ridiculous how easy this drinks for a 9.5% DIPA."
"Overall: I enjoyed this bottle just a bit more than the glass that I had on tap a few days ago but both are delicious. Tap had a stronger, bitter bite I feel. This is a very good West Coast style IIPA that sends a nod toward the East Coast balanced IIPAs. I wish That I could get it for 1/2 what we have to pay here in PA"
"Thanks FW for coming to Philly!"
"Overall an great double IPA. Now if only we got Firestone Walker in Colorado..."
"Dirty copper in color with little head to start. What little foam there is at the beginning reduces to a very light wispy cap. However, long sticky lacings adorn the glass from top to bottom throughout. Aroma is extrememly fresh cirtusy grapefruit and tangerine. Medium bodied with lazy, fine carbonation. Intense citrus hop flavor in the front with grapefruit, papaya, and tnagerine. These flavors carry from beginning to middle with a bit of malt presence. Finishes with an intense tropical flavor that tapers to a piney hop finish. After a few sips the alcohlic burn becomes appparent. Bitter pine flavor lingers a bit but is a pleasant reminder of how good, and how fresh tasting, this DIPA was."
"I’d take a single jack over this one, but still a great beer. The booze and sweetness is a little heavy for me."
"This is my first of the Proprietors Reserve Series. I've had the Pale Series brews and enjoy them very much but this is just the next level. I felt the Union Jack needed some more malt in my opinion, so you could imagine how I felt when i first sipped this one. As I said this is a very pleasant sipper, its a very satisfying beer. Im totally impressed and can not wait to crack open the Walkers Reserve and 14th I have waiting. Not to mention the ever so popular Abacus. I really don't have much more to say, I just want to drink more. I love the alcohol content of this along with the dangerous hop bite, its that too much/just right feeling. Anyways fellas ima go drink some more and buy some more later and i'd advise all of you to do exactly the same. A great choice to review this for my 40th review. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"O - Not a bad DIPA. It looks great, but the smell is a little off and perhaps a little bit stale. Its easy to drink for a 9.5% brew. Not too bad..."
"22 oz bottle/draft"
"Overall, this is a wicked DIPA. I love well balanced beers, and this is certainly that. The only qualm I have is that, for the amount of good smells, this lacks slightly in the taste. Still doesn't prevent it from being one of my favorites!"
"orange/reddish amber color with small white head. Smell is initially, piney and resiny, a bit harsh actually. Taste is similar, the bitterness comes through right off the bat followed by pine and an almost soapy character. Intially, I was disappointed at how harsh this one was. As the beer warmed however, the harshness disappeared and it settled into a nice tropical fruit flavoer and aroma. Malt backbone that seemed non-existent comes forward and adds some sweetness. light bodied. This was almost two beers in one, and perhaps a result of being served too cold, but at a warmer temperature, a very nice beer."
"Thanks for the hook up, Jeffo!"
"O - This is a delicious Double IPA that i will buy again and again, as long as its available. Not a session beer, but i could drink this often."
"O - i can see what all the hype is about with this one. very very impressed."
"D- This beer is easy to drink but has great big hops that are juicy and complex with out being overly pungent or bitter. delicious."
"A nice DIPA, not perfect, but scratches the hop itch pretty hard, if the boozeyness was dialed back this would be a world beater. A welcome addition to the Mizzou beer scene!"
"There are so many good DIPAs out there - I'm giving this one a 4 in terms of overall enjoyment ... maybe not the top of the heap for the style, but really damn good as beers go."
"O: A very good example of the style. So far my 2nd favorite behind DFH 90. Well worth a pickup. Would love to have on draft."
"Freakin awesome IPA. This is my first Firestone Walker beer and if this is a sign of things to come then I will be one happy man."
"I really wish FSW would distributed to CO! Great brew in a Great trade! Thank you Steve!"
"Notes: Let´s hope it lasts but these new offerings locally thanks to the new and-or expanded distribution in the region are most welcome. I have had some of their hoppy stuff before, and this is right there: great DIPA."
"The mouthfeel is full, sticky, and coating. Great for a DIPA. The drinkability is also exceptional for the ABV. This is just a great double IPA, I wish more beers of this style could be as exceptional is this. A superbly crafted brew that doesn't get out of hand."
"On tap at a beer festival poured in a sampler glass. From notes: Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with one finger of foam and moderate carbonation. Good lacing. Delicious nose. Pineapple and tangerine. Hops are nice and fresh and the malt is forward enough to give it very good, sweet balance. Carbonation is too low, giving the mouthfeel a smooth but heavier than desirable texture. But the overall balance of the palate still makes it pretty easy to drink. Piny/grassy hops and just as sweet honey malt flavors. The hops are crisp and bright enough to lend some lightness to the beer but the malt profile is nearly as big as the hop. As such, it doesn't come across as bitter as you would expect and has an uncommonly clean finish that features very little in the way of resiny hops. Not the hop bomb style I prefer but certainly as good a DIPA as I have had with this amount of balance."
"O-Solid,solid DIPA.Glad to have Firestone Walker in the Missouri market.Bring on the 14th Anniversary."
"The hops hit you as soon as you crack the bottle. Huge aromas on this badboy. The color is a bright gold with active carbonation. A frothy white head sits for minutes before reducing to clumps all over the glass. Smell is of sticky raw pine sap, bready, earthy malts, and a bit of grapefruit. Taste is sticky sweet with loads of piney hops. The grapefruit and citrus dominate the finish and leaves you thinking its dry but underneath there is a devilishly sweet malt backbone. Definitely need to rehydrate after one of these. Overall a solid DIPA, very much like a west coast hopped 90 minute."
"Overall? Phenomenal, this is a wonderful DIPA, there aren't many that can compete with this one."
"O- One of my favorite DIPA's I've had so far. Another winner from Firestone Walker."
"Pours a yellow/orange/amber hybrid with a one-finger cloudy white head. Quickly dissipates, but still manages to provide good lacing. Aroma of really sweet grapefruit notes, orange and tropical fruit, some alcohol notes as well. Taste starts off with semi-bitter grapefruit hops. A lesser hit of sweet orange and tropical fruit mellow that right out. Nice subtle sugary malt backbone. Oily pine hops bring more bitterness to the finish and linger."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops (grapefruit), slight floral hops, sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight floral hops, hint of wet hops, sweet malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, no one aspect surges but, the beer on a whole is great. Good appearance, aroma, blend, body, and mouth feel. For an almost 10% the alcohol is very well hidden in flavor, but the warming-effect is very noticeable. Also, the mouth feel is refreshingly smooth for such a strong ABV."
"One wasn't enough, my buddy and I went back the next day to grab a few more."
"O: Double Jack is a good IIPA lost in a sea of great IIPAs... coming from the west coast with such things as Pliny and Citra, this one doesn't quite measure up with the best of them in terms of cleanness of flavor and crispness. Still worth trying though and a solid beer overall."
"A dangerously drinkable double IPA that's loaded up with tons of fruity/herbal goodness and a solid malt backbone to help shoulder the weight of this big hop bomb."
"Overall/notes - Definitely an excellent beer. As an IIPA, it's surprisingly easy to drink. Honestly, this is one of the reasons I'm happy that Firestone Walker has shown up in Missouri. Went really well with a garlic-butter braised chicken breast. Seriously.. I don't try to pair food with beer that often, but I'm doing this combo again soon."
"MF: The body doesn't match the ABV, making it extremely easy to drink. A little coating after the finish along with lingering semi-sweetness prevents this beer from being forgotten."
"Just a wonderful DPA... The balance is fantastic. Welcome to MA Firestone. Please stay a while!!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and oily, with a medium body, mild carbonation and a nice hoppy spice pucker that is bitter, but not offensive. It's aggressive and the alcohol is present, but the taste is so good that it was hard to stop drinking this; as it warmed, more flavors came out and made this even more complex and worthy of a beer to sip and savor. A great beer that I very much enjoyed and recommend trying. Not a session beer, but one that I could drink on a monthly basis - it was that good."
"Until then enjoy as an outstanding american ale, thanks again to our california friends."
"O - Right in the conversation with the top DIPA's. Maybe not the best, but costs less and is less intense than many."
"Notes: This is just the sort of DIPA I like. A great balance of bitterness and tropical fruit flavors. Very easy to drink annd pleasing on the palate. Bitterness may not satisfy the rabid hop head though."
"O:Nailed it like a double jack hammer ;)."
"overall, this beer is toward the top end of the vast double IPA category. it's thoughtfully put together and while beefy mainatains a refreshing quality. excellent beer and a pretty good value as well."
"O: Fantastic! Easy drinking, extremely balanced, tasty, juicy and delicious!"
"Overall, the alcohol is a creeper, it is we'll hidden. A nice refreshing supper on a hot day."
"Overall this is a top-shelf DIPA experience"
"Go and get a bottle of this!"
"SEEK THIS ONE OUT!"
"This beer really gives you some thing to talk about. The feel is slightly heavy but has a good amount of carbonation to wash away some bitterness and make light of the amount of alcohol in this beer. It seems to cushion the feel of this beer as it goes down so it feels smooth and not too big. IT has a pleasant bitterness and not a slam that rocks you off your foundation. One of the more well craft beers I have had. This beer has it in spades."
"O/D- No alc. A very good IIPA. Smell was great, taste was solid, just a little to much cloying caramel and sweetness for me. It was more on the balanced side."
"There has been some comparison recently between this and other DIPA's and I gave my opinion above (because my opinion matters so much). IMHO, a better comparison is its little brother, Union Jack, but on steroids and with more balance. Really an amazing brew."
"Mouthfeel is a full medium body with a mild stickiness. This drinks a little too well, the 9.5% ABV is not noticeable at all. It is so tasty it can be difficult to slow down. I will admit that it snuck up on me towards the end of the bottle."
"Extremely, extremely drinkable for the ABV. The malts cover up the alcohol. Watch out! You can down it like a normal IPA."
"O - This DIPA was made for me. It is big, not overwhelming and surprisingly smooth. The hop presence is exactly what I wanted."
"Overall a really great example of the style. If I were to try to put it in relative terms with other """big""" DIPAs, its kind of a slightly toned down PtE or Pure Hoppiness in terms of the intensity of the hop presense while still feeling very much like a west coast style DIPA. A beer I certainly will go back to if I can get my hands on it."
"A clear amber, bright and crystal clear, with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and average lacing. The nose is much better than I was expecting. Very hoppy with a blend of bright and candied citrus, there's orange, tropical fruit, candied orange and pineapple, all present. There's a definite malt backbone present, with some caramel, but the nose is dominated by the hops. The palate opens with an explosion of hop flavor, again it's candied oranges as well as fresh citrus and some tropical fruit. The malt is much more assertive on the palate, with a moderate caramel presence, along with some honey. The hop character is rather juicy, making this really enjoyable. Bitterness is moderate, rather surprisingly so for a DIPA this big. Mildly sweet on the finish with plenty of juicy hop flavor, this is excellent stuff. The mouthfeel is particularly excellent - soft and creamy on the palate, accentuating the hop flavor, this aspect was the best part of the beer IMO. While I'd pick the Union Jack over this more often than not, this is something I'd love to drink again, and fresh."
"Overall - I loved this beer. It took me two nights to drink, and this double feature packed a wallop on my expectations of a double IPA. I think it's right up there with Maharaja."
"O: I think I found the beer that kills PtE and a lot of other good DIPAs, this is hands down one of the best crafted DIPAs on the market."
"Overall, this is a great beer that I'm glad I got to try. If anything was lacking, it might be a result of the bottle not being the freshest. However, if this time allowed the malts to come through, I'm glad I tried it with a couple months on it. Good stuff."
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 2/10/11. Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with one finger of foam and moderate carbonation. Good lacing. Delicious nose. Pineapple and tangerine. Hops are nice and fresh and the malt is forward enough to give it very good, sweet balance. Carbonation is too low, giving the mouthfeel a smooth but heavier than desirable texture. But the overall balance of the palate still makes it pretty easy to drink. Piny/grassy hops and just as sweet honey malt flavors. The hops are crisp and bright enough to lend some lightness to the beer but the malt profile is nearly as big as the hop. As such, it doesn't come across as bitter as you would expect and has an uncommonly clean finish that features very little in the way of resiny hops. Not the hop bomb style I prefer but certainly as good a DIPA as I have had with this amount of balance."
"D: A very nice citrus forward IIPA. I LOVE this brew dudes"
"D- Very solid with some complexity. Falls short of what I consider """elite", the malts are just too sweet, could be a cleaner flavor, hops are a bit muted. That said though, it's still a 'good' beer."
"-Cheers"
"O - Very good DIPA. Im so glad FW brought this to Missouri."
"Not a bitter DIPA, but still quite hop forward with some sticky and sweet malt. Nice medium body and well carbonated. There is some nice citrus flavor, but its missing some bitterness."
"D/O- Out of this world drinkability for a DIPA. This is the type of double IPA, along with the likes of Maharaja, that I like because the alcohol isn't so well hidden. First Firestone Walker, thanks PTMcB."
"I like Double Jack, but it is a little bit boozy for me, and as I said, the sweetness is substantial. I guess both of those traits are unsurprising considering the ABV. This is pretty good, but I think I like Union Jack a little bit more."
"D: Goes down somewhat easily, somewhat tasty, somewhat filling, definite kick, ok representation of style. The hop and fruity flavoring are quite good. However, the malt sweetness is a touch too much in the finish, and the alcohol could be better hidden. I have had better representation of the style."
"Taste, decent enough, definitely a dipa, I tend to prefer the single union jack though, you get more of a hop mouthfeel out of it. This one amps up the bitterness, heavier malt bill to cover it. Its a good beer, but sometimes more or double just covers up what made you like the original version in the first place. A little apple presence to this one."
"Mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium but not a thin weak beer at all. Drinkability is good because this beer has a good balance of bitter and sweet. All in all I have to say its a top notch IPA. It has everything you are expecting to find in an Imperial."
"Overall this example is solid. It has some rather unexpected characteristics and qualities that make it interesting. There is, however, a lingering astringency factor that may ultimately cause this beer to be passed over considering the wealth of fine representatives of the style with slightly more refined characteristics. This was an extra in a fabulous collection of bottles from my generous benefactor. Thank you, Martin."
"Clear, light amber with a big soapy ivory colored head of lather that leaves plenty of fine lace on the glass. The aroma is much like sticking your nose in a bag of Amarillo and Centennial hop pellets, fresh resinous and citrus hop character with sweet caramel maltiness. Delicious, and hoppy with a freshness not often found in a bottle of beer but only in fresh draft in my experience. The malty backbone is nearly perfect in balancing the sap like hop resin with caramel cube sweetness. Medium full bodied with smooth carbonation. As good if not better than the more sought after hard to get """whale""" DIPAs out there. World class."
"Cheers"
"D- Such a spectacular beer. Wish I'd reviewed it when I had it on draft. In any case, this is a champion in a rather huge and diverse style."
"A great hop forward beer with an amazing balance. Firestone Walker's Double Jack easily rates up there with Hopslam, Double Trouble, Hop Rocket & any other DIPA/IIPA that comes to mind. Count me in as a believer in this brewery; Thanks for coming to Missouri!"
"This DIPA delivers as expected. One of my new favorites."
"Was happy to this here in MA. What impressed me with this beer was how true to style and well balnced it was, while carrying 9.5 ABV so easily. It is a perfect looking IPA with a good head and some lace. The smell and taste are citrusy and not too bitter. Great beer."
"0 - Worth getting again, and again, and again..."
"O: One of the very best DIPA's I've had. Bursting with a complex mix of tropical fruits, tons of malt, and good balance of sweetness (a touch heavy for me though). If you like balanced tropical fruit/pine hop monsters, this is one to search out."
"Really good balanced dipa. A touch of alcohol burn, but very well incorporated. Nice smooth body. Reminicent of hopslam and doble trouble for me."
"good stuff, a great drinking DIPA. i love to see good DIPA's under 10% and this is a perfect example."
"D- Very solid brew for sure and a bit complex. Probably a bit of sipper and could sneak up on you."
"O/D-Where is the %9.5 alcohol? I cannot taste it. Incredibly drinkable. Overall, I am very happy with this one. It came at a relatively cheap price, and my goodness that is a nice taste. Definately up there with some of the better DIPAs I have tried. Fits my tastes as well. Meets my expectations and then some. Try this if you can."
"O: Any traces of alcohol are well masked from the taste, making this beer very easy to drink considering its strength."
"Overall a great DIPA, very little booze, nice malty backbone that stays in the background but balances the hops well and supports them, the hops get musty and resinous on the aroma, but keeps throttled back, then the flavor is just pure citrus, tropical fruits, and sweet candy like hops. Tasty and drinkable."
"O- Overall one of the better DIPA's I've ever had. Extremly delicious and will make this one of my go too's for the future."
"Mouthfeel is a strong category for this beer, as it is perfectly smooth and slick, with a sticky finish that lets you know this guy isn't light on the malt. Dryness still present in the finish keep it pretty drinkable too. Pine and resin are a bit too strong to make this incredibly drinkable, but they don't affect my ability to finish a glass or two."
"Really pleasant beer but not blowing me out of the water in any direction. Maybe it's balance is the best quality?"
"Overall (Drinkability): A tasty beer. Plenty of hops, balanced, and very drinkable. It's not the hoppiest IPA I've ever had, but it's tasty and I will definitely pick up more the next time I see it on the shelves."
"Overall: a definite winner!"
"O: Very good beer. Well crafted, and I would argue this contends with the best IIPA's out there (Hopslam, Expo Hoppiness, etc)."
"O - A bit of a sipper, but a very good one. Alcohol is a bit heavy and acutely noticeable in the flavor. This is a beer you can stay with for a while...within a single bottle. It is on the strong side and doesn't hide it's strength very well. The flavors border on outstanding, but you really have to pace yourself here, or you just might not get up off the floor. Planning on having another beer tonight, but not sure I can handle it after quaffing this one slowly."
"D - So good on tap that I grabbed a bomber to try tonight as a comparison."
"D- I really appreciate the chance to try this great brew, but I prefer a Pliny (yeah, go figure) fresh Hopslam, Sculpin or Nugget Nectar to this zesty taste. I guess DIPA's are too much for me at this point in time although I'm sure with a great DIPA like this it will garner a lot of fans."
"Pours a clear honey color with a nice 2 inch white head that fades to a small cap. Good rings of lace on the drink down. Smells of pine, citrus zest, pineapple. Taste is very hop forward with citrus zest and pine, pineapple juice, brown sugar, and a sweet malt finish. Medium hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation level. A bit sticky in the mouth. Slight alcohol burn in the throat with each sip. Overall, a very good DIPA. I really like the citrus and pineapple flavors that come out."
"An enjoyable DIPA all around. For a higher score from me it would need a juicier tropic strength. I will probally buy this again, i did quite enjoy it."
"O: Really good overall. Sweet and fruity flavor and a mouthfeel that goes down smooth. Alcohol is bold but well integrated. Glad I tried it."
"This is a great beer and pleasing to drink. 5 years ago I would have probably given this a higher rating. But the standard for IPA'S has been raised."
"D - Very enjoyable beer! Too bad it's not around very often or I'd buy this regularly."
"A fine beer, I find that the hops don't 'pop' as in the Green Flash or some other DIPAs I have had. Still great, though."
"This beer pours a pretty clear copper in color with a two finger one finger off white head. It continued to bubble the entire time. It smelled very dry, of piny yet overly sweet hops and very sweet malt. The alcohol was right in your face and not well hidden at all. The flavors were a mix of dry, bitter hops with a load of sweet malt. There are a boatload of hops but this is way too sweet for my liking. Where's the balance? It's far too one sided. It tingles the palate and leaves you dry with a sweet malty aftertaste. I'm not impressed. This beer doesn't feature any balance. It's hoppy, so what, the alcohol was distracting. It's not just that it was present, but that is was dominant. I wasn't thrilled by this by any means but I'm glad I finally got to try something from Firestone Walker."
"Drinkability: The early versions of Double Jack (prior to bottling) were pretty muddled. I could see what Matt was going for (a double IPA that focused more on hop bouquet than hop bitterness), but it just wasn't working. This bottled version, however, is perfectly balanced and harmonious. Well done, sir!"
"D: Really nice beer. Had a growler of this last year and was not that impressed. Nice to have a bottle I know is fresh. That being said it is an expensive bottle. It reminds me of Unearthly in a lot of ways just less citrus in the hop front and a slightly worse nose."
"Glad to see Firestone Walker on the shelves in MA. Truly enjoyable IPA."
"There is still good retention on my glass and the only thing stopping me from drinking these all day is the 9.5%. Wow!"
"T: Much more on the malty side of the scale than the hoppy side. There's a bit of a hop snap about midway, but other than that, the malts and a bit of caramel sweetness dominate this one. Not bad, but not one of the better doubles I've had."
"D - Yeah, everything above compounds into something spectacular. I've had alot of DIPA but this, this one shatters them all. I cant think of anything this can improve on. Outstanding aromas here, the flavour is a ridiculously close second but the aroma, man oh man. Its the freshness of the bottle that makes this rank incredibly high for me, it has to be, I mean, the smell cant be THAT intense some months down the road can it?? This is a 9.5 ABV and I'm drinking this like its some absurdly low number. What's this? The bottle is gone already? Damnit!"
"Double Jack in the Chimay glass looks a bronze/shiny copper with spots of faded orange and just enough bubbles to form a decent cap. Semi stick to nothing. Smell is of citrus with bubblegum juicyfruit style. A good amount of tangerine, less on the pine, mlaty backing. Taste is a crisp heap of juicy oily hops that give off more citrus than earth. a nice mix but im leaning on the tropical side. A sweet middle giving off gum, a earthy finish. Feel is sticky, filling and bitter but not over the edge. About medium, carb is not biting my tounge. I could not drink this all day and I believe I've had better doubles. I'll take the single Jack over this any day FRESH!!!"
"glassware: pint"
"A terrific addition to the Jersey craft beer markets."
"D: Quite drinkable, though it's certainly an imperial IPA so there's bitterness."
"As a lover of all things hops, this DIPA seemed right up my alley. The price is right too. I'm used to spending over ten bucks for my premium bombers, and for this beer I gladly would. The color, the lacing, the aroma, and the balance....yes, it's a DIPA that isn't ALL hops. This is a well balanced beer for hop heads and folks who don't usually go here. It's easily my new favorite. I'm anxious to try this on tap, as I usually make the mistake of drinking too cold. It's tough for me to be patient when it comes to this fine brew."
"In terms of taste, this is a great drinking Imperial IPA. However, the alcohol is masked by the huge flavors, and it can creep up on you."
"My first taste from this brewery and it's a good one. I look forward to more."
"Overall, a nice IPA with a distinct hop profile. The herbal and pine notes really are the star. If you enjoy those type of flavors in your IPA, you would enjoy this."
"D- Very solid brew for sure and a bit complex. Probably a bit of sipper and could sneak up on you."
"Overall I'm very content with the effort, now showy or aggressive by any means. Pleasant for IPA lovers!"
"Very impressive beer. The more I drink from Firestone Walker the more I am impressed. Perfect balance and hits every mark. Double Jack belongs on the top tier with all the great DIPAs. Simply a damn good beer."
"The flavors are strong and clear and they don't back down at any time. Hops are strong but not overpowering. I was very sorry to finish, I easily could have had a second. This is one of those rare beers that stay interesting and pleasant from start to finish."
"D- this is a nice change of pace for the dipa. The flavors come off as more complex and deep then a lot of the others in the pack."
"in the bottle the beer seems to be a bit dominated by sweetness. it isn't heavy handed but actually quite intriguing. the pour is clear orange with a smaller head and a lace. nose is an intense sweet tangerine. this is the predominate flavor that is backed with a nice floral bitter. pine finish that clears the sweet. so the intensity is balanced out. a bit peppery. but as for the scope in broadness of flavor i think the ipa was just as elaborate. but i would like to give this a shot fresh from a new keg."
"Still one of my favorites - fresh or not so fresh."
"Overall, if you can get some of this while it is fresh seek it out!"
"Very nice DIPA. It has a delicious yet fairly mild flavor and an extremely high drinkability. A good everyday DIPA (or it would be if it was available year-round and not so expensive) that all fans of the style should check out. Recommended."
"M & D - not balanced. Overpowering hop bitterness. Strange balancing act here with the sweet, citrus, and bitter."
"Solid. Will buy again."
"I have and will drink this beer again and again. Cheers to you Firestone!"
"D: Quite drinkable, though it's certainly an imperial IPA so there's bitterness."
"Fairly easy to drink, but the alcohol presence really shows up as the beer slowly warms and is more pronounced on the nose especially which is the only bad part of this beer. The flavors on the nose and tongue are exceptional and I enjoyed drinking this one. Great job by Firestone Walker."
"D: Good stuff I'd get again."
"D: A very nice citrus forward IIPA. I look forward to having this one again."
"This is a great beer, one of the best DIPA's I've had."
"4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"Clear bright orangish amber body, multiple streams of very small carbonation rising from center-bottom of glass, 1 finger bright white head, medium dissipation with a bit below average lacing. Nose is tropical , more mango than guava, with some bready and caramel malts for balance, not much citrus character until the beer had warmed significantly. Taste is on the dry side balancing out the significantly tropical hop notes, though once the beer had warmed significantly the finish became increasing bitter. A wee bit above medium mouthfeel, light effervescence, a bit sticky. Good drinkabilty, very smooth. Another fine offering from Matt B., one of the country's best brewers. Worth checking out for all hopheads."
"D - A very good DIPA, easy to drink but at times it was hard to not imagine this is a beer and not a fruit juice! Still, very good."
"Overall: Very hoppy, but smooth. Much like Union Jack (drank a bottle last night) but with more malt and alcohol. I might prefer a fresh Union Jack for everyday drinking, but this beer is a treat. Easily drank the whole bomber."
"A few factors keep this from being a top tier DIPA. A little too much alcohol presence and a little sweet with the malt and hop combination for my liking. I like a lot of sweet, juicy IPAs (Just Outstanding and Sculpin are both amazing and fall into this category) but this beer lacks the tropcial fruits and the added alcohol warmth doesn't help. A tasty beer but overall I prefer regular Union Jack, and it's cheaper!"
"Very good on the whole, with a bit of tweaking I feel this could be a great beer, but as it stands it's 2nd tier."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Overall- A very flavorful DIPA, tons of hop flavors, but does not quite have the overall bitterness. A great choice if you are looking for hops, sans the bitter. Can a 9.5% IPA be an introduction version to the style?? I actually think this could be!"
"I'm a little torn on this one...It didn't quite live up to my expectations, but I do like it. Maltier IPA's are not my preference. I'm liking it more as it warms up though. Seems to get more of the tropical fruit notes that I detected in the nose as it warms. At $8 for a bomber, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to get this."
"This oddly reminded me of the 50-50 Hopslam-Double Trouble mix I made recently. Very delicious."
"D- A bomber of this would make a great after-dinner treat for two. 22 oz makes a wonderful evening for one, you just have to keep a glass of water nearby to wash out your palate periodically."
"Kudos to Firestone Walker! I was going to take a break from DIPAs for a while, until I saw this on the shelf and snatched it up. I'm glad I did. An accessible yet incredible DIPA. One of my favorites!"
"A heavy DIPA. A bit too sweet for my liking, could use some more hop flavor."
"D: goes down very smoothly with little bitterness or alcohol burn. Very drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Found myself savoring it a bit, knowing this was my only bottle. Would love to get another one to enjoy."
"M/D - Full body. Extremely flavorful, alcohol content was undetectable, easy to drink."
"Drinkability: A stellar beer. I've been on a real tear lately and am likely reviewing most things about pdev, but that's just the way it goes sometimes. First, the 9.5% is fairly high, even for the style, though - to its credit - you can't taste it anywhere beneath the sweetness and the hop astringency. Second, this is a damn good DIPA. It's a little meatier, more dank, more resinous, and more juicy than some people may like, but it's definitely right up my alley - if you like your hops dirty and nasty, this is definitely one to try out. No wonder FSW tossed this in barrels and made it an important part of FW14. Regardless, this is a fantastic DIPA - though as a ratio of fantasticness:price, it's less so - and it's worth a shot from anyone at least once."
"D-I'd put this up against many of the top rated beers in the style."
"D: could drink em down."
"The senses: The appearance is light copper orange with a decent sized head. i could tell this beer was pretty viscous as the small bubbles of carbonation slowly fizzled from the glass on an epically slow journey towards the head. what a great sign! The smell is boooold citrus. Grapefruit and tangerine dominate, but a slight alcoholic heat is present. Flavors are amazing! this beer is sweet on the lips with citrus flavors and a solid malt backbone. i love what the munich malt adds to the body of this beer. it's a bitter beer for sure. the tail end of the flavor is a little hot, but surprisingly appreciated.It's thick mouthfeel is glorious. it's like sipping on maple syrup, that's how thick and viscous this beer is. i gave it a good solid """4"" on drinkability because this beer is 9.5%. if i had more than one bottle to myself, my head would be hurting tomorrow."
"Double Jack pours a crystal clear orange. The off white head rises to three fingers in height before threatening to spill over the top of the glass. Retention is very good, but lacing is spotty. The nose is pretty intriguing, a dash of caramel followed by a ton of tropical citrus and a hint of pine. It could stand to be just a little bit more pungent though. That same caramel sweetness shows up in the flavor, though it's still just a brief introductory note. The hop bitterness, while certainly present, is incredible smooth as it fades into the beer's finish. Gobs of pineapple, mango, and and orange crash over my palate, as again some resinous pine notes skulk around in the background. I feel fairly confident in saying Double Jack has the best mouthfeel I've ever found in a double IPA. It's a little bit creamy, but incredibly light and spry for its size. It drinks like it's 7% tops instead of almost 10. Carbonation is absolutely perfect, a ton of tiny little bubbles popping on my tongue as they bring the big hop flavor. With zero alcohol presence, and a remarkably rounded bitterness paired with more than ample hop flavor, Double Jack is an all time classic in the world of imperial IPAs"
"Pours out a nice carmel brown with a rich earthy hop aroma. Not much of a head down quickly and leaves a little lace. Taste surprisingly balanced. Obviously as a Double it is hoppy but not overpowering and you can still get the nice roasty flavor. Not bad in the mouth and its easy to drink but the taste is the best part of this brew for sure."
"Bottom line, I'd drink this in a heartbeat."
"This brew shines in the taste and mouthfeel department! Extreme bitter hops up front and an alcoholic bite lingers. Huge, sweet, apricot like malty goodness! Outside of the huge bitternes, this dipa is so creamy and smooth. Way to easy to drink for almost 10%!"
"D: Pleasantly surprised by this beer. Firestone walker done good. It's been a while since I've had a decent double IPA and this is a nice way to get reacquainted with the style."
"I need to go buy another bottle."
"d - A very nice DIPA. Lots of orange and citrus in the nose and taste, but not too bitter or overpowering. Would like to have again."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a very good double ipa, great representation of the style. Definitely a beer to seek out!"
"Smooth medium body, nice creaminess, and soft on the palate. Pretty nice drinking for a DIPA, the alcohol is high but not overdone. I wanted to try this one for a while and wasn't disappointed."
"D - extremely drinkable, which is surprising considering the ABV upwards of 9%; that's a little dangerous (in a good way). All in all a very pleasant experience, though I do think it would have benefitted from a bigger hoppy kick."
"D - This was highly drinkable at fridge temp, then really teeters off as it warms. Otherwise, the appearance and smell have me coming back for more, and I'm really enjoying a slew of west coast hops with a thoughtful malt balance."
"D - I could drink it all night (except for the fact that this is the only bottle I have)."
"Overall, a clean, drinkable DIPA. For my own personal preference, I'd rather see this at 8% or so rather than 9.5%. Not that the alcohol is very noticeable, but I am feeling it rather quickly. Also, the residual sweetness, while not intense, is a little much for me to warrant a 4.5 or above. Still, a very solid beer."
"I had this several hours after a Pliny and I was still pretty impressed. Very hoppy, but balanced DIPA. One of the better F/W brews I've had. Two thumbs up."
"Overall: I really like this beer...to me this is the epitome of what West Coast DIPA should be. Move this one right up there next to the big boys in this category. Try it if you see it!"
"D: really good DIPA that was drinking and tasting great but kinda reminded me of Expo hoppiness."
"M - Medium body, chewy, oily. Lightly carbonated."
"D: highly drinkable despite high ABV. easy, smooth drinker."
"Mouthfeel is light, slightly filmy in the mouth, pleasant and fitting for the style. Surprisingly (almost shockingly) drinkable for its strength. Excellent beer."
"Compared to the tap, Double Jack is a little subdued -- the flavors just aren't quite as bright and snappy. But as a DIPA it's still pretty damn incredible, and ranks in my top five for sure."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Double IPA."
"Highly enjoyable night capper, hop head's delight, glad to have gotten the chance to enjoy a fresh growler pour of this one."
"I have always had an issue with a DIPA having too much malt in it. It makes me think that the only thing the brewer is looking for is the ABV to be high. I have to disagree in this respect (even if they aren't just looking for a high ABV). I love Firestone Walker and think this could be an outstanding beer, but I believe it is brought down by the malt being one of the main flavors rather than the hops."
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty sweet on the lead off position. The sweetness falls away quickly giving rise to a decent midpalate hop character of tangerine and other citrus hops, some piny-ness but the citrus is the start here. The finish is not too dry and adequately bitter. Easy drinking for a big IPA. I'd have it again."
"*Paired with baked tilapia in a cilantro chipotle butter reduction"
"Final Thoughts - I was at the Toronado when Double Jack was released a year or two back and the recipe has been changed FOR THE BETTER from then to now. Not nearly as malty as it was back then. It's much brighter now and hops are showcased MUCH better. A much cleaner and citrussy beer than it was before and I thank you for that Firestone! A very smart move and well done."
"D: This was a great IPA with nice tropical hops and strong, clean bitterness. The body was good too, and the alcohol was pretty well hidden. So it was fairly easy to drink, as long as you can handle the bitterness. Not quite a top tier imperial IPA, but not far off either."
"This is one glorious, glorious beer."
"D-As is the case with the best DIPA's, the alcohol in this beer is completely undetectable. Another really solid, well balanced, and very drinkable DIPA up there with Hopslam, The Oracle et al."
"Body is middle for a double IPA, but a great delivery vehicle. Lingering bitterness, but nothing that cuts into drinkability. Maybe a bit too fruity and sweet, but a pretty nice little package."
"Alex, thank you for including this. It's been a pleasure to drink."
"Clear orange/amber body with a fluffy white head. Really citrusy aroma with a hint of sweetness. Big citrusy flavors, almost like biting into an orange, kinda boozy and candy like in the back end though. Pretty bitter but the malt does make an appearance. Normal DIPA mouthfeel. An enjoyable DIPA for sure but not mind blowing, a bit boozier than I like in the style. I would drink this again but wouldn't go nuts for it. I think the Union Jack is a much better take on it's style."
"Overall, this is good, but not one I'll pick up very often, unless I'm in the mood for bitterness. I personally prefer Arctic Panzer Wolf to this one: they both go for the same brass ring, this one falls just short. Enjoyable and worth a try? Yes. The best around? Nope."
"A bit too sweet, with only a bit of hops to balance it out. Still tasty, but would rather grab something else at this fairly high price point."
"This is a full-bodied beer, smooth and almost creamy in the mouth. There is a bit of alcohol warmth in the back end, but certainly not bad considering the ABV."
"O: I like this beer a lot. Am seeking it out on tap, haven't seen it yet."
"The feel was rather unremarkable, but it made it nice to drink. Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours orangey gold with a nice frothy tan head. Malty aroma with a variety of spices and herbal hops. Sweet malt flavor with sugary bread that washes into a big herbal hop blast. Nice fruitiness but the bitterness is too modest for me. Slightly astringent, full bodied, a tad boozy."
"Overall, and I know some will find this sacrilegious, at 9.5% this slots nicely between Russian River's 8.0% Pliny the Elder and 11.0% Pliny the Younger. I'd like to see Firestone Walker to a Triple Jack!"
"Quite a good Double IPA. Big hop notes very nicely balanced by a big, bready malt fiinish."
"D: nice, but on the malty sweetish end of the style."
"drinks well. a bit hot, but not out of bounds for a 9.5% beer. tons of flavor, wish this was available more readily around here."
"D: I consider """Union Jack""" to be one of the best IPAs I've tried in the last year. However, this was just sort of a novelty, """Take that you hopheads!""" version of that. Still, 2nd rate Firestone Walker is still better than most A-game efforts by most other breweries. Good stuff!"
"Overall an ok DIPA it is not bad but I feel the beer is somewhat flawed. I do not think it is bitter enough. I wish the beer was a bit smoother."
"Not what I expected - or should I say hoped for, since I expected something like this after those who created and believe their own hype felt disappointed. Still, I enjoyed Double Jack and it does nothing to alter my love for Firestone Walker."
"A very well made and rich beer. Could be a bit brighter all around for my taste but a rich, well made beer that's full of spice, light coffee, citric, cooked lemons and all the great stuff that makes a nice double IPA."
"Really like drinking this at home as opposed to at the bar cause then I don't have to drive."
"I found myself drinking this beer faster than I would have liked at first. After about half the bottle I was getting fuller than usual for this style, probably from what can be considered heavy carbonation. The sweet finish really resonates and was more than I expected. It is a mighty fine DIPA, one that would be ideal on tap."
"- Overall it is drinkable, but a bit too sweet for my taste in double IPA's. To be quite honest.. it is much like the Pyramid Outburst I just had before it.. and that was under $7 a 6-pack. Price doesn't affect my beer judging."
"D: This beer had the unfortunate burden of meeting impossible expectations. Union Jack is probably my all-time favorite IPA. Plus, Kevin at Grape & Gourmet praised this to the moon, saying that it was as good as Pliny. Given that backdrop, I couldn't help but be disappointed. This may not be God's gift to hopheads, but it is a very very solid DIPA."
"D: Very easy drinking beer, perfect for one searching for an evening hop fix for this is one hoppy beer. West coast style DIPA at its best."
"Very well balanced, complex, and extremely flavorful. I tried this a few days after Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum and found the Double Jack to be far more enjoyable."
"D: this is a very drinkable DIPA. hides the alcohol a little too weird."
"D: This is an excellent example of the DIPA style without going totally over board on the ABV. Great beer, find it and drink it."
"A lot better than anticipated, the drinkability skyrocketed. $8 is reasonable, but no economical. I enjoyed it a lot and would glad for another purchase."
"i saw another reviewer describe a beer as 'topaz' in color and I think it fits the bill here - a beautiful clear topaz color that puts up a 1 finger head and leaves pretty rings of lacing all the way down - smells good with pine, citrus and floral hop bouquet - taste follows the nose pretty well with good hop bitterness and prickly carbonation, finishing with a sweet and sticky malt finish with some fruity notes as well - slick and oily in the mouthfeel without excess - very drinkable for a double ipa - thanksto Alex @ DeCiccos in Ardsley for recommending this!"
"-i enjoy this beer for sure. there is a bit of harshness in the taste and flavor the entire time that keeps me from wanting to drink a ton or put it on a higher level. but it is a good beer either way and worth trying at least once"
"Mouthfeel is smooth with good carbonation and a bit of a slickness to it. Overall, this is a big hoppy brew, but it's somewhat on the sweet side for me and I'd like it a bit drier overall, as the sweetness is a bit much for a whole bomber. Looking forward to further Firestone brews."
"D: A really nice DIPA -- but is that a compliment? I would prefer Union Jack 4 times out of 5 for its bright hoppiness and lesser ABV."
"D- Awesome. I love the complex flavor. Perfectly balanced. It never gets old. One I would pick up again for sure."
"D - tasty and not too heavy. Pretty drinkable."
"Pours a crisp clear orange with a good amount of white head. Smells very piney with some grapefruit coming through. Smells very hoppy. Taste... Leaves something to be desired compared to the smell. The hops are not as potent but the malt profile is huge. A well balanced dipa in a lot of ways. The mouthfeel is incredible... Very thick and a bit sweet. Highly drinkable for the prcentage. A very good albeit interesting dipa"
"D-very nice. Goes down in no time."
"Drinkability -- Not bad, but not incredible. Great nose, but the taste disappoints. The hop profile is all over the place and, honestly pretty distracting. I don't see myself reaching for this again. One surprisingly good thing about this beer is that the alcohol is completely masked."
"Drinkability: This is just a really great beer. It would be near perfect if it got a little less bitter and grassy at the finish."
"Final thought - This and Elder are my favorite IPA styles by far. This one I think take the cake and I am so glad they finally started bottling it."
"Very easy to drink. Very balanced. Perhaps a tad too sweet for my personal taste, however it's definitely a solid offering from a great brewery."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was very good for me, I loved the hoppy flavors it had. I typically really like DIPA's that aren't overly bitter and show some of those tropical fruit like flavors to them. This was no exception. Best hoppy beer I've had in a while."
"This is a quintessential West Coast DIPA... purely awesome."
"If Firestone Walker is reading this, you got something real good going with this beer. I'm going to keep buying this beer again, and again, and again, and again, until I've rendered myself into total palette shock."
"D: Highly drinkable due to the taste and aroma but the ABV will catch up with you over the course of a full bomber."
"Quite drinkable, but this will really wear out your taste buds. You will not be able to taste anything subtle after finishing off a bomber of this big, huge hop fest in a glass. Although a bit over the top, the hop, malt and alcohol are blended very well. I would come back to this one again."
"Drink- This was great. Heard a lot of noise about it and I didn't want to be let down. So glad I wasn't a very great DIPA"
"The mouthfeel of Double Jack is another of its strong points. The beer is medium bodied with lighter carbonation. While it could become a bit sticky, the sweet malt and lingering hops avoid too much resin and ruination. This was certainly the creamiest beer in our lineup, and the drinkability suffered just a touch from the weight and malt presence. This beer can hang on a big stage with nice balance and good, expressive taste and smell. Only the best beers in the world beat it out and, unfortunately, that's what happened at our tasting. I would still happily consume more fresh Double Jack any day! It's a bit more bulky that a beer like Pliny, but has a nice bitterness and hop bite."
"Overall, it's very balanced and a good example of the style, and a good value too... the only problem is mine: that I prefer drier, less malty IPAs."
"Overall a very good beer. And not too pricy for a bomber. One of the better IPAs I've had but not in the top 5."
"The body wasn't as full as I'd hoped but still fuller than a lot of the style. Drinkability was pretty good for a brew this strong and hoppy. Overall, a very good example of the style, worth trying when you see it."
"Not my favorite. I'd rather have single jack. Too much of an east coast style dipa for a west coast brewery."
"I like this beer better on Tap. The Hops show up more in the smell but the mouthfeel and tastes are basically the same."
"The mouthfeel is great, thick and creamy, smooth, easy to drink and enjoy at the same time. Solid double ipa."
"Not the best Double IPA but good for the $7.50 a bottle this costs. Will buy some more."
"Drinkability - Very impressed by this beer and will get another. Granted, I do taste the alcohol (it is 9.5% granted) in each sip I take, but since it is so strong the more I drink the less I taste it, heh. Overall I am glad I got this beer. Somewhat reminiscent to Knuckle Sandwich to be sure, though a bit more of a hot mess and less flavorful. Still, a good beer."
"I was stoked to find bottles of this at my local BevMo. Bottled 12/15/10...so less than a month old. Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a small white head. Scent is VERY hoppy with TONS of sweet malt and sugar aromas. I also get a lot of citrus aromas and mango. I had this on draft about a week ago and kinda got that """cat piss""" aroma that some DIPAs have, but not with this bottled form. Taste is initially sweet sugar and malt with some amazing candied mango flavors. Then I get a lot of delicious citrus flavors, followed closely by lovely floral notes. Finishes with strong hops and nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and smooth. Somewhat silky for a DIPA...very nice with clean crisp finish. Drinkability is high, as the ABV is hidden extremely well in this beer. Great DIPA!"
"CHEERS, FW!"
"D: While not a home run, this beer does have a special talent and that talent is projecting its West-coast hops profile in high fidelity. Drinkers looking for multi-layered complexity in their DIPAs should search elsewhere; all that Double Jack has to offer is one pure, resonant note. The texture of this beer is its greatest failing, not so much sticking to the palate as blanketing and suffocating it. Despite moderate bitterness and a fairly short finish, it leaves the palate wrecked and in need of re-calibration."
"I am really enjoying the vibrant hop focus of this beer. I really like that the nose is completely focused on this character and that the flavor has just a touch of bitterness and hop-herbaceous character to add a needed balance. A definite pleasant surprise, for some reason I wasn't expecting too much from this beer, despite really liking fresh Union Jack. At this particular moment the fruit focus this beer has is definitely quite appealing, though I could see this being a bit too fruity and cloying to some (even to myself under a different situation)."
"I could drink several of these...alcohol is masked well and the beer is delicious. Glad I ordered it off of a fantastic and large tap list at Jake's."
"darkly golden, clear and delicious. wet with citrus, a drooping orange tree interspersed with grapefruits and a few meyer lemons. dazzling. the citrus melts in your mouth, the malt is sweet but plays astoundingly with the hops. the balance is superb, not really very bitter at all, extremely hop forward, though, and mounting an assault against my fairer senses. (not senseis). drinkable? ay, too drinkable. happy to be served them in 8.5 oz pours and not pints, for they be dangerous. double your jack!"
"D: Very drinkable. Probably my second favorite DIPA to PtE. Very, very easy to drink. No need to sip it other than it's serving size and wanting to savor it."
"I'm a big fan of this one. Glad I got to try it on tap!"
"Overall Impression: The problem with this review is: I tried this beer after Pliny the Elder. Yes, I cleansed my palate and waited a few minutes, but you cannot follow that act!!! I'm sure if I had this first, I would have good things to say about it, but at the time, my taste buds were simply underwhelmed. If I see it again, I will definitely try it again."
"Pours a burnt amber color with decent cream colored head and nice lacing/retention. Smell is of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerinie hops with a nice sweet carmelly malt and roasted nut background. Taste follows scent with the fruity hops backed by a sweet and roasted malt profile. Fairly heavy body for a dIPA but clean and smooth on the palate.., maybe a touch more carbonation needed. Very nice dIPA with a solid malt background paired with fruity hops - almost unheard of for a West Coast IPA."
"Drinkability: An excellent desert beer."
"Overall I was really anxious to try this since I am a huge fan of the Union Jack. This did not disappoint. More grapefruit goodness than the Union Jack but balanced very nicely. I know this would be expensive to bottle, but in the end, it may well be worth it. Excellent stuff."
"Had again at The Ginger Man with good orange hop taste."
"Interesting, glad I had a chance to try it, but I prefer the IPA version."
"Draught at Toronado during RBSG09. This really is just concentrated Union Jack. the malt is just a bit sweeter, the hops pack more of a punch, and the alcohol is slightly more evident, though still well concealed. It's good, but I'm already a big fan of Union Jack and this doesn't bring a whole lot new to the table. I do appreciate all the effort it took to get such an intense hop aroma in there though. Since it is not very widely available, I can see myself indulging when I get the chance, but I wouldn't pay more for it if it came in bottles on the shelf next to its little brother. I think that FW has to start from scratch to make a winner of a DIPA"
"Overall a great beer. One of my favorites."
"Too thick for high drinkability marks, though true to the style. This one truly drinks like an imperial."
"I'm extremely glad I was able to have this while in SF. Highly recommended, but if you are looking for a DIPA you may be disappointed. Unique and amazing."
"D: Quite drinkable, especially given the ABV. The hops make me want more and more."
"D: Decent, but when I want a dIPA I want something that actually registers on the bitterness scale that my tongue measures. In fact I think the regular FW union jack has more hop in its step."
"Tap @ Hamilton's. Poured clear gold with a bubbly white head. Thick, sitcky lacing. Tart, crisp hop aroma. Predominately grapefruit and oranges with some citrus zest and grass. Biscuits. Lighter than expected mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Very nice double version of the Union Jack. Pretty much the same flavors, just more of them. Fresh white grapefruit, tangerine, pine, and and herbal/earthy quality. Malt is biscuity and dry. Absolutely a must if on tap."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow, some amber highlighting, very thick white head forms, slowly settles to a thick ring and layer, lots of lace spirals stick to the glass. Smell is real nice, lots of grapefruit, floral, orange peel, grass, big caramel maltiness, biscuit, very clean, hops don't blast your nose but are pretty balanced and well done. Taste is similar, pretty hoppy, but malty as well, caramel sweetness and biscuit, grapefruit and floral hops, a touch herbal and grassy, gives it a nice British/American DIPA feel, solid bitterness but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, goes down smooth. Despite being a pretty big beer, this is just nicely balanced and drinkable. Real nice stuff, maybe not as enjoyable for me as the regular Union Jack but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Tough one to rate for drinkability. I really like the flavors but it seems so heavy. I wouldn't consider drinking more than a pint not because it's strong but because it is so filling."
"D - Great. Refreshing to see a double IPA with a complex malt character and yet still be a hoppy beer. Well worth the hype."
"All in all, a middle-of-the-road offering for the style."
"Union Jack."
"D: Definitely a good drinking DIPA, but would have loved it to be more bitter and have more citrus."
"Overall: A great DIPA...not the best, but up there with the second tier hop-bombs that you'll find. Cheers!"
"Had this on-tap at Barclay's in Oakland. Pours dark golden/light amber with a thin head that sticks around as a very thin cap, with nice but somewhat sparse lacing. Smells of lots of sweet malt at first, followed by a breadiness and grapefruit juice- smells like lots of Simcoe hops here. A bit spicy, and a tiny bit piney at the end. The taste is bigger and spicier with citrus and pine plus bready malts, and quite bitter in the finish. In the mouth, there are chewy malts and a bitterness that keeps on building. I think that the regular Union Jack IPA is one of the more balanced IPAs out there. This has become something quite different. Its still balanced in the sense that there is a lot of sweet malt to balance the huge hop smack, but this has become a monster- albeit a delicious one."
"Bitterness isn't high, and hop flavor isn't potent. It seems to me like this is a Double IPA in ABV alone. I was expecting a bit more from this beer because I really enjoy Union Jack."
"Appearence is orange copper. Smell is that strong pine malt we are all used to with the UJ and seemed identical in appearnce. Taste seemed sweeter to me and much more enjoyable. The hops were there but seemed a little tame compared to UJ. There is more complexity with the Double Jack. There are different stages that start with the taste we are used to but stands out and leads to a sweet almost apple/citrus mouthful with a toasty and very enjoyable light malt finish. Nothing harsh about this for me. Alcohol is at the back of the bus on this beer. Drinkability is through the roof on this! The 9.5% would have fooled me. I could drink this everyday if it wasnt for the price being $25 to fill my growler. Im not a big fan of UJ but this one is an exception!"
"On tap at the Oregon Brewers Festival. Pours a beautiful clear amber with a thick, rocky head that rapdily dissipates. The smell is uncommon for a DIPA: you get the stereotypical pine/citrus notes, but you also get a peach/vanilla smell that doesn't show up much in this style. Mouthfeel is classic: medium-bodied with a just-so level of carbonation. The taste starts with the blend of its Union Jack cousin: floral hops with peach and light caramel. Then Double Jack flashes its DIPA bona fides with strong pine and lemon peel with a dry hop smack to the tonsils. A great beer that shows that a display of hop athleticism can coexist with more subtle and complex flavors. A class act."
"Fantastic DIPA that deserves regular rotation. First, let's get the Union Jack comparison out of the way. Double Jack is smoother with more sweet caramel malt and hoppier with quite a bit more fruit flavor. On to the review... Double Jack pours a bright orange-yellow without much in the way of head, but it's always difficult to judge head when the beer is too cold and on tap. The aroma is simply wonderful. It's a blast of candied pine, tangerines and grapefruit rind. The sweet malt is noticeable, but the hops are clearly the focus. The flavor is rich with hops, much like the aroma. The malt backbone provides good sweetness. It's well-balanced on my scale of DIPAs, anyway, which is to say not balanced but not quite as bitter as some. The flavor also imparts some other fruit flavors, apricots, peaches, other lighter stone fruits. I found the fruit flavors more varied and fuller than nearly any other DIPA I've tried. The feel is round and strong without any cloying sweetness or bitter astringency. Drinkability is quite good for the size and style."
"D: A fantastic Double IPA out of Firestone. I wasn't the biggest fan of Union Jack, but this Double version is incredible, well worth the wait to try this beer on-tap."
"The Toronado had a release party for this on 7-8. I had it on 7-14. By 7-19, they were sold out."
"Love your show Firestone."
"Worth seeking out and should definitely be sampled more than once to get a full rounded opinion."
"Pours a brilliant reddish-orange that radiates from the glass and has a bubbly off-white head that dissolves into a swirly fine layer around the glass. The aroma is fresh citrus hops with some toasted malt in the background. The flavor is piney and citrusy hops upfront and is accompanied by some a nice touch of malt and finishes with a grapefruit bitterness. Its full-medium bodied and has a nice amount of carbonation. This beer absolutely blew me away. The aroma smells like a basket of hops and the flavor doesn't let you down. In my opinion this is far superior to my encounters with Pliny. This just has a nice malt backbone to accompany the delicious bouquet of hops."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer. I had been looking forward to trying this since I first heard about FW going for a DIPA. I would like to try this again to see if the nose improves at all. That was really the only disappointing aspect for me."
"D: This is a pretty decent beer, but the way they chose to release it (OMG mid-week Toronado release party!), the way they're being difficult about growlers, the claim that it would be the next Pliny the Younger, and the high price (more expensive than Pliny the Elder) built up expectations that this would be phenomenal. It's not. This state is saturated with DIPAs, so what they were trying to do with this is beyond me..."
"Another great FW offering, and another high quality west coast DIPA."
"Poured a nice orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is ig orange peel, grapefruit and a little maltier than traditional Union Jack. taste is very much like standard Union Jack with orange peel, grapefruit, lots of citrus and some pine riding on caramel malt. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth, I thought very smooth for a IIPA. Hopb ite on the end was minimal, beer was chewy and tasty. very drinkable! Very good! Its no Pliny but damn it is good."
"D: Very drinkable in my opinion. This beer is very balanced and the alcohol is well hidden. I was expecting much more of a hop bomb and am a bit disappoint that it was so balanced. However, this is a very solid beer and will be making another trip up to Paso to have it and will buy it again if I happen to run across it at another location."
"I recommend having this one first or early in your session."
"Overall: Great beer. I really like a grassy IPA or DIPA. It kind of reminds me of Apline Beer Companys Duet. As that is one of my favorite beers, this one definately ranks up there."
"Overall an excellent beer. A little high in alcohol and hops for most people but any hop lover will love it. They are only sending this out in 5.2 gallon kegs so get your hands on it while you can. I have been waiting on this for a while and it lived up to my expectations."
"Overall, the dry hopping dominates, and I wish I could do so well with my homebrew. The drinkability is almost scary. An exceptional brew and one that I hope they do again, as the tasting room staff say they will."
