Was left smelling like a brewery with a massive headache.  So i cant help but think to myself, do those who rave about Heady Topper drink only ONE beer?  I don't know anyone who drinks one beer and stops.  I do know one thing, this beer is not to be consumed continuously for a night of good times. The stink of it! No sir, i don't like it.

However, i came from around the world and have been Homebrewing for 8 years; just to drive countless hours and wait in line; only to take a sip of the worlds finest! Yes, it lives to its standards! I e-mailed the company and all the stores to assure myself and acquire some of this brew! I got turned down by both saying to follow the truck and wait in line. I did and popped my first can at Route 7 in Shelburne VT at 945 in the morning to find the LOve of my IPA's!! A very balanced and strong double IPA leaving resigns of pine flavor in my mouth many minutes after drinking. 5 out of 5 for sure and still to this day worth the wait as i did on 30-March-2015 at Route 7 in Shelburne VT. Thank you, I will do this again just to get a case. Chris","BEER88","Apr 01, 2015"

Somewhat subtle in the flavor department for what I expected, but very, very good. Orange, tropical fruits, herbs, earthy, wine like alcohol. Just different. I know, real helpful, but I dont think I can describe it with any justice. What I can tell you is that it is very creamy, and smooth as hell.

Appearance, from what I saw from the others who poured theirs into cups, was orange-copper in color and topped with a huge head. The aroma was outstanding, citrus and tropical fruits, lots of pine, a little faint malt. Taste is slightly sweet with orange, pineapple, mango flavors. The bitterness comes mid palate featuring pine, citrus peel, and resin. Medium body, thick texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish. Is it worth the Herculean measures to obtain? Maybe not, but a world-class DIPA.","SierraFlight","Feb 12, 2015"

I honestly looked for defects in this as to not let the legacy of the beer sway my review and suck all objectivity out but damn, it really is worth every penny of hype it receives. What I look for in an IPA is balance. Typically when I get into DIPAs, I tend to relax my search for balance as it is typically replaced by too much sweetness or a touch too much heat (and that's in the best DIPAs I've had) The reason I believe that Heady deserves the critical acclaim is that it has re-written the rules so to speak, for me in approaching the DIPA. Yes, it CAN be well balanced and brilliant within the style. This one opens up with a great nose full of citrus AND pine somehow, without overwhelming on either. Taste follows identically until the sweetness in perfect harmony with the perfectly balanced malt backbone join in and combine every sensation together for one, again, very well balanced taste that finished with just a tiny touch of heat that reminds you that it is a DIPA. Full bodied, well balanced, pretty much every superlative that you can find in describing a great experience in drinking a beer belong here.","gopens44","Feb 10, 2015"

This experience is entirely in the can. I'm sure there are other beers that are objectively as good. I doubt there are any better. This beer won't fix our national deficit, make dogs love cats, or bring back Jimi Hendrix. It will, however dance across the palate in an entertaining way. My advice is to open one and enjoy slowly from the can. The entire flavor profile changes as it warms. I am sure many people have tried Heady that was shipped to them. Getting this beer warm is like feeding a wet Mogwai after midnight. I shipped some to myself when I was on assignment in Texas. It was sent on a Saturday and I got it Monday. Was not the same beer I sent when it arrived. For anyone who has had it this way and reviewed it, I really don't think you got it the way it should be. Oh, and about the can vs glass debate... if you drink it slowly the later complexity is seriously diminished when its been poured into a glass.","Walruzuma","Feb 09, 2015"

4.42,-6.6,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Tastes much hoppier than the nose revealed, unleashing an hop onslaught on the palate from the very beginning, masterfully balanced by earthy white-bread malts, which receive a glazed accent, as the hops turn dry, parting from their grassy, slightly tropical initial direction. The fruitiness begins with ripe oranges, peach and tangerine, while more and more citrus peel gets added. While the malts are indeed capable of setting a counterpoint to the hops, they don't got an overly sweet character to them, more like a biscuity earthiness - just the right amount to prevent this brew from being hop water. Finishes with a dry, long lasting grapefruit bitterness, coming along with quite a bit of pine and a distinct maltiness. Drinks overly smooth, while ending with an enjoyable, almost herbaceous, bitter hop bite, developing from the fruitiness, without swallowing all of its sunny components.","aleigator","Jan 16, 2015"

This beer is all about the aroma and flavor.  Piney earthy aromas and flavors.  Very much a New England example of an American DIPA, in the same ballpark of the Gandhi Bot. Goes down very easy for an 8% beer.  If I could get this beer regularly, I would have it prominently featured in the regular rotation.","KidDoc","Jan 10, 2015"

Worth the two and a half hour drive (one-way), for sure. Drinking out of the can, as recommended, I only noted its light, creamy yellow color towards the end.

5,5.7,,,,,,"My only gripe is the whole drink from a can...I'm not buying that. However, this is by far and above my favorite beer to date. The perfect balance of hops and malt for my palate. Although hop forward, there isn't that strange aftertaste associated with some overtly hoppy beers. The alcohol seems non-existent. Notes and tastes of citrus (grapefruit in particular) meet a creamy and well-rounded pine.","rynegne","Dec 02, 2014"

Like hoppy candy. The taste is awesome. Great bursts of citrusy west coast hops but also a good bit of pine. Surprisingly balanced in terms of hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard of a DIPA. Smooth and well carbonated. Overall this is such a great beer.

4.5,-4.9,,,,,,"Of all the beer styles in the world, a double IPA is one that I'd never expect to call gentle and smooth, but this one certainly is.  My only complaint is a touch of alcohol heat, especially on the first sip.  It creates a dissonant tone after such a perfect first experience.  Its not very bothersome, and I don't even notice it halfway through the beer, but it was a bit of an off note after a surprisingly great first sip.  After drinking this beer, I have a new perspective on double IPA, and I'm realizing that there's a lot of really bad ones out there.  For me, it's sort of like the first time I heard Metallica's Master of Puppets album at age 11-12.  I realized that most of the other heavy metal I thought I liked was absolute garbage or at least not as good as I thought it was.","UnionMade","Oct 13, 2014"

5,5.7,,,,,,"On a trip up north to Vermont I realized I was in Heady topper country.  I honestly wanted not to like this beer based on the fact everybody likes it.  I thought the limited access was the majority of the reason it was so desirable.   Expecting a normal IPA with some deviations I can say I was dead wrong.   It was like nothing else I've had before but so familiar to my favorite hoppy IPA style.   I was a little unsettled about drinking it out if the can but got used to it after the third one.    The first thing I did was smell the hoppy aroma which was great. The beer was excellent, a dank, hoppy, piney, citrusy IPA with a more heavy mouthfeel.  Very complex   If I could buy this I would always have a 4 pack in my fridge.  But I'm from NY and the beer doesn't travel far. I tried 5 or 6 different stores the alchemist website states it delivers to and all the stores sell out in hours to a single day.   A bartender hooked me up with two cans after a couple of hours of drinking and chatting.   It's not easy to obtain this brew making me want it more.   The two in my fridge are killing me right now     I'll be sure to give one to a real beer guy friend who knows his hops and has been around the beer isles.  This will not be wasted on a bud light drinker I promise","russell157","Oct 07, 2014"

Well, with great anticipation, we sat down at my home bar, popped the top on a can and away we went. First thing to hit you was the aroma. Piney, hoppy. And that's where it ended for me. This beer is better suited to be an air freshener than a drink. I was sitting there tasting what in my opinion is way over the top flavor finished with bitterness. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. With all of the thousands of beers in the world this is the # 1? Not a chance. In the end I felt like a kid who got a beautifully wrapped gift only to discover a bag of sox or underwear inside. What a bummer.","Avool1960","Oct 04, 2014"

Heady is not for beginners in some cases but if you like hops this one will blow your stack.....I'll end by saying that this is the most dangerously drinkable 8% beer I've ever had.","HopDeezy","Oct 03, 2014"

The only decreeable flavor i could pick out was mandarin orange. I think this would be a nice session beer, but this is absolutely not a memorable beer.

I thought it would be easy to find once I got to the home town but I may as well have been in California. I struck gold at the best Western hotel I stayed at because their cafe had some in stock.

I understand the buzz that is created with the elusive factor of beers like this, Pliny, Founder's KBS, etc.   And while the brewer John Kimmich has every right to keep this limited, I would suggest he brew more and make it available to more states (just a business take IMO).   Nevertheless, we ended up getting four cases between four people and have enjoyed this all summer down here in New Jersey, and will be back in VT next summer to get more (or sooner if we ski).   And while we had other great IPA's in Vermont such as Lawson's and Hill Farm Stand, this one (to me) is just so drinkable it is scary in a good way.  Cheers!!","dahlen22","Aug 26, 2014"

The beer poured a hazy straw color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly sweet malt....and I was hoping for more pine and citrus. The taste was a good balance between sweeter malt and bitter hops there is presence of some pine and a touch of apricot like citrus all bolstered by an oily resiny base. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but not the best IPA I've had (IMO). It's great...don't get me wrong...but the original Zombie Dust before is was massed produced was better.","WoodBrew","Jul 27, 2014"

One of the best I’ve had or known about so far. It’s very drinkable and very enjoyable. Thank you again Jet and Danica for allowing me to experience this.","heysuz","Jul 19, 2014"

No surprise here, that's pretty much the taste on the palate also. Quite a hop punch to this DIPA, excellent balance and acidity, alcohol masked well. Unbelievably drinkable and just so damn fresh. It's like I'm chewing on a hop cone. They say it's the water that makes this special but whatever it is, keep doing it. I hope they begin to distribute because getting a can of this in NYC was hard. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head. It's a tough call, but I think this might top the all mighty Pliney!","bneel317","Jul 14, 2014"

Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. This is exactly what a DIPA should look like. Smell is of citrus and mango. The Simcoe really comes through in the smell. Taste follows the nose. Just in-your-face juicy hops. Fruity, cirtusy, a little pine. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, which makes for a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. Mouthfeel is great. I always say with a juicy IPA you need a fuller mouthfeel and this is exactly what I mean. Overall, a great DIPA, one of the best. Would I go way out of my way to get it again? Probably not but it's something everyone needs to try at least once.","MisSigsFan","Jun 29, 2014"

At 8% ABV it's biting but not overwhelming (I do like a high ABV stout or barleywine) and keeps it crisp with the aroma hops addition(s). Delicious and perfect for a VT summer BBQ.","lifenoob","Jun 19, 2014"

Not earth shattering but so unique there's just no other canned/bottled/draft DIPAs with these traits they built they're brewery around this recipe and I can see why. No let's see more innovation and how about some distribution outside of Vermont.","WVbeergeek","Jun 13, 2014"

This reminded me of a more smooth, balanced and less alcohol version of hopslam. IMO, which honestly means nothing to anyone else other then me, this is not the best dipa ive ever had. I can think of 2 or 3 locals ive had that I enjoy more. And a few other ipa's ive had that I liked more. I did enjoy It moreso then the other highly ranked, hyped dipa pliny but there's no way id travel a long distance to buy it or I wouldnt trade for it again but,,,,if it was available at local shop id pick it up for sure in when I want a change up from my favorites. I did enjoy this more from glass, as I always do for any canned beers.","wvsabbath","Jun 13, 2014"

It's a very nuanced and flavour forward profile, lighter and more floral than I might have expected, it nonetheless delivers what could easily be called a flawless execution. As a dipa goes, this would have to be near perfection, as far as across all styles... That's a matter of opinion.

The flavor is nearly perfect, and as long as you don't mind haze or drinking out of the can there is very little that you could find at fault about his beer. Every phase of the brewing process contributes to the flavor of the beer. Hops, malt, peachy esters from the 'Conan' yeast, as well as numerous intricacies I am sure only the brewing staff is aware of (ie water profile). This is a real ale, so many brewers seem to be taking the IPA away from the malt and yeast character and this one embraces them and finds balance with them. This beer is a true beer.","Siriusfisherman","May 09, 2014"

And then I took another couple sips and all my disappointment faded away.

Although, the level if IBU's have been consistent at times I can have one where the hoppiness really comes through while other times it is more gradual and the notes are released with perfection. I know that the brewery has other brews that it releases in limited quantities, but I hope they can try and produce the other options with a bit more releases then they currently offer. But no complaints they are staying true to their brew and """Heady Topper""" is always on my list of brews that I would have on any given day.","SovietBear1982","Apr 16, 2014"

The old Heady I am having now from mid-April 1914 poured mostly foam over hazy orange, receded to thin surface foam and patterned lacing.  Not as hoppy but with loads more grassy notes and added floral notes as well, making this still very enjoyable!    The quality still shines.

5,5.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Thanks has to go to nedvalton, a most generous BA'er for hooking me up with my first Heady Topper. As soon as I popped the top on that shiny silver and black can I got blasted with the dankest, hoppiest, fruitiest, hop bombiest goodness I have ever experienced. There's just so much going on with the smell, that I am having a hard time nailing it down. Here goes nothing, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, Bubblegum surf wax, I swear I'm getting that. This stuff smells exactly like I imagined it would after reading so many of the reviews on here, an absolute delight. I poured about half into a tulip glass so that I could get a good look at it. Pours a super hazy and resinous golden orange hue, minimal head and lacing. It smelled amazing in the can, but the complex aroma really opened up once poured, now I'm even more intrigued. My first sip and all I can say is, YES! Worth all the hype, 100 percent! I've had a few other beers that come real close to this, but the mouthfeel and balance along with the juicy aftertaste make this an absolute work of art in a can! With each sip it gets better and better, the bitterness isn't overwhelming at all, and couple that with the citrusy/fruity/floral undertones that coat your tongue, it's easy to forget that theres alcohol in there. Just like it says on the can """so drinkable, it's scary""" Overall I can see why this beer is ranked #1, because it just became my #1 as well. Thank you nedvalton, and thank you Alchemist!","Qwest_35","Mar 08, 2014"

Taste is very smooth, silky mouthfeel, with moderate-strong but not overwhelming hop profile. It's all peach and grapefruit with no dank character at all, more intense and complex as the beer warms. Only a mild suggestion of the heat in the finish. This is a great beer but perhaps not as world-class a beer as Pliny, in my humble opinion.","Maurizio","Mar 08, 2014"

Very Lucky to have a friend pick me up 12 of these unreal IPA's . while I like hoppy beers I like balanced IPA's not overly bitter. . This beer is perfect. Drinkability is unreal for an 8% IPA.

Living in NH, my close proximity has allowed me to enjoy it fairly regularly. A wonderful smelling beer that when fresh can literally fill a room with a floral citrus hop aroma. It pours with a nice head, and has a typical cloudy appearance in the glass for the style. The alcohol is well masked. This beer has a nice balance of heavy citrus hops and bitterness. My only wish is that the alchohol content were a little less so I could enjoy more than one in an evening. However, it is the kind of beer you can drink slowly and savor each sip. If you have not had it, make a trade to get it, as it deserves the #1 rating it currently holds.","RobbDogg","Mar 02, 2014"

Since I can now say that I am lucky enough to have had both Pliny and Heady, I can say that they are similar but different. With Pliny, I get more pine and less grapefruit off of the head. The malt takes more of a secondary role and I get less resin from the hops throughout. With Heady, the malt is sweeter, and makes its presence known throughout as it dances with the bitterness. It's impossible to chose between the two, but they are obviously in a category of their own. Heady is a very well-balanced IPA with as much flavor-per-sip as you're going to get in the IPA category. Definitely lives up to the hype.","Zaso","Feb 21, 2014"

All the stuff in the aroma comes through and coats the tongue with a wave of pine and citrus. So resonious. Nice carbonation, as well. Mouthfeel is where this beer shines.

I will say it's one of the best DIPAs I have tasted, although fresh from the tap Enjoy By is right up there too. My buddy got me a four pack of this for my birthday and I am very grateful. It's a great beer to drink on a summer night and the 16 oz. serving just enough. A little more than your typical 12 oz. home serving, but much easier to finish than a 22 oz. bomber.

Doesn't break ground in any new way but just shows what something masterfully brewed tastes like. Deserves to be in the same sentence as that which contains other world class double IPA's, but to me falls short to the likes of Kern Rivers Citra, Lawson's Double Sunshine, and the stellar Alpine Bad Boy.","MarcWP","Jan 13, 2014"

The aroma is fruity - tropical, with some apricot and mango. The flavor follows suit, with mango, apricot, pineapple, and a bast of big sticky hops. The mouthfeel is big and round. This beer is at once unusual and familiar - it reminds me of the beer to which it is so often compared, Pliny the Elder, though it is bigger and fuller, both in its tropical fruit and rounder mouthfeel. It's clearly less dry than the Russian River beer. But curiously the West Coast beer to which it most closely compares, in my view, is Racer 5 from Bear Republic - they are different beers, but both are round, fruity and given to showing up with a thick orange haze. It is as if Racer 5 and Pliny crashed into one another and spawned some crazy new hybrid. Heady Topper is a very good beer, but I wonder whether the frenzy would be as great if it were produced in greater quantity and distributed more widely.","Seanibus","Jan 05, 2014"

Absolutely delicious from beginning to end. After my first few sips I sat there and just smelled it over and over to let that beautiful hoppyness permeate. great finish to the beer, tons of hops and floral tastes along with a sort of citrus/fruitiness. The hardest thing about this beer is keeping it in my fridge. Don't let anyone know you have this beer if you really want to savor it, because people will ask to drink one.

Taste is incredible with lots of pungent grapefruit in your face balanced by the piney bitterness and malt. Keeps you wishing you had a whole case. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated.

It evolves gracefully (probably at it peaks after one month, but it can be enjoyed even one year after canning, regarding my own experience, being really focused on the yeast quality). One of the best DIPAs I have been able to try, and one I really love revisiting on a regular basis.","Fux","Dec 07, 2013"
4.12,-12.9,3.5,4.5,4,4.25,4," I like the idea of cans. When you get a fresh one it's very cloudy, naturally, because it's unfiltered. I don't really mind this but a lot of people do. The taste is great. Very hoppy, grapefruit and floral. I like the beer a lot and I want more, but it's not as crisp of a beer as Pliny. Heady is a bit more malty and slightly more bitter. Whenever you can find this beer drink it right away and do not save them or age them. It is best drank as fresh as possible.","HomersTomaco","Dec 07, 2013"

I actually like the glass offering better, but here goes: Poured from can into DFH snifter. Great looking light pale yellow beer with an inviting 2 fingers of head. Straw hues and a bit of cloudiness. Smell is awesome. Citrus hops meet earthy/pine hops. Getting grapefruit and apricot on the nose. Taste was pretty balanced and smooth for such a strong announced IBU. For not a big fan of the style, I was glad it went down as easy as it did. More pronounced fruit as it warmed. The can offering just seemed a bit less flavorful? to me than the glass. Feel was great with a medium heft and carbonation that was pleasant. Overall: The best IPA I have had, but again it's not my wheelhouse. I liked the citrus frontend and balance. I can see where those who love the style would really like this. I would drink again and think it's a must try.","TheDinger","Nov 24, 2013"

Although the instructions on the can say to drink from the can I have on occaision used a glass, which is my prefferred beer drinking method. When you first open one you are hit with a wonderful smell that is not matched by any other beer I have ever experienced. The flavor of this awesom double IPA is very hoppy yet slightly fruity at the same time. There is something else unique about the tast but I cannot put it into words. I guess I find it robust and strong but smooth at the same time. The limited avaiablity undoubtedly adds to the mystic of this beer. I usually only get to have some about twice a year. Whenever I drink other IPAs I always mentally compare them to Heady Topper and they alwasy fall short, even if they are very good. For me nothing tops Heady Topper!","DWaters","Nov 21, 2013"

Outstanding looking beer, not that clear watery look that many have, looks full and rich, orangish color, impressive head that stuck around and lacing was ideal.  I know I am supposed to drink it from the can but it is a great looking beer.  The smell is unreal, the citrus really jumps out at you.  The flavor follows and is also incredible, the juicy citrus jumps out at you, real smooth except for the bitter.  May be just a bit to much for me (not a hop head).  Plus, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue.  Rich, full texture with great carbonation, the perfect amount.  I did not notice any alcohol, it was an extremely easy to drink beer with the exception of the lingering bitterness.  Not the top for me but I completely understand why the hop heads love it.","JamieDuncan","Nov 04, 2013"

This isn't the most aggressive IPA out there, the ABV is a bit high; however, considering it is a DIPA, I'd say this brew is spot on. It's a great brew; however, to you that are buying this on the gray market, I strongly suggest not paying more than $8 a can. These run $12 a 4 pack in Burlington and I've seen locations out here in Los Angeles reselling them for $12 a can. This is completely ridiculous... It's a great experience to try, but don't get taken advantage of. Cheers!","santomark","Oct 16, 2013"

I guess I have gotten used to super bright IPA's like the ones from Stone. The appearance is the only knock. The smell is magnificent. Super citrus, pine and resin. Upon tasting, I really can't believe the lack of bitterness that does not come with all that hop flavor. The hop flavor must come from a killer hop stand. Small amount of sweetness at the end of the sip, but make no mistake, this is all about hop flavors and aromas. I've never had an IPA quite like this. Mouthfeel is moderate and well-carbonated. Overall, this is a new type of IPA that I will look out for. Huge hop flavor and aroma and slight bitterness. This one kills it!","33nickadams","Oct 13, 2013"

4.47,-5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Picked this baby up from a great friend at the Borefts Bier Fest! It's a little over a week since it was canned so it's super fresh. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Fresh, dank, resiny hops totally dominate the nose along with some great perfumey, floral and citrus notes. This is one of those really special smelling beers that you'll always remember. The taste is just as big and bold. It starts off like the nose as a total fresh hop monster, full of resiny pine and bitter grapefruit along with some nice tropical notes. About midway through there's a measure of balance as some of the caramel malt sweetness emerges along with some orange peel, tangerine, and a bit of grassiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oddly creamy for an IPA. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable for such a big, hoppy beer. Overall, not sure it lived up to all the hype, but still one hell of a beer!","beerdrifter","Sep 29, 2013"

Beautiful pale hazy yellow when poured, which I did with 1 of 4 cans I've had so far. Delicious, smooth and flavor-filled. Hits all the right notes. Little floral, little citrus and a little pine lumped together into a spectacular punch of flavor. Spent 10 hrs in a car to bring this home and it was worth every second.","jd18","Sep 28, 2013"

Deep, dank, fresh bag-o-hops smell...spicy, resinous pine, pungent, juicy citrus, and peaches. An almost toffee-ish malt profile lurks underneath. Huge hoppy flavor (obviously): fresh floral hop cones, grapefruit, pine needles, stone fruit, maybe some tropical fruit. Seems kind of like a lot of Simcoe to me. Dry, smooth,and textured. Bitter, but nothing crazy. This is a great, supremely hopped-up DIPA that manages to stay really drinkable. A bit too hyped up, but undeniably impressive.","wedge","Sep 28, 2013"

The aroma is similar to smelling a handful of fresh hop pellets on a brewery tour. resinous, out of control sharp hop notes of grapefruit, pine, some pineapple maybe and fresh cut peaches. Really great nose. The taste is much of the same as the aroma but with a big juicy feel to it that makes this drinkable. not overly bitter as i would have expected which adds to the drinkability. The mouthfeel is medium bodied since its unfiltered and has a chewy character to it. Really great beer, perfect for all seasons for sure.","Augustiner719","Sep 25, 2013"

5,5.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Overall - This is a great beer that I would drink more often than I can find it in Southern California. If anyone is heading to the LA area from an area where you can get this, I'll pay you with my first born child! Just kidding, but seriously this is a great DIPA. I still think that Pliny has it beat for my top beer, but for different reasons. The proprietary Conan yeast is really great, it let's the hop flavors come through while enhancing them and not muddling them. I think that the low amount of coagulation that the yeast gives is part of the reason for the creaminess.","BeerEngineer","Sep 05, 2013"

The taste is a little bitter than the citrus comes in. At the end the hops bite your tongue like a rattlesnake.

What John Kimmich and his crew are able to bring out of hops is something like I have never tasted in a beer before and quite frankly I didn't know was possible. This beer pushes the envelope of not only what an IPA/DIPA can be, but beer in general. This stuff is absolute liquid gold in a can and if you like hops then you must taste it sometime in your life.

The nose is intense orange peel citrus, resin bitterness, chewable kids vitamins, caramel malt, and a touch of earthy yeast. The flavor is orange and grapefruit peel, bitter resin, chewable kids vitamins, the same earthy yeast, and just enough caramel malt to keep everything in balance.

I was begging my relatives, clients, Ebay posters and friends to find a way to get me a try since I saw that Heady was the world's top rated beer on Beer Advocate. Finally, one of my friends came thru and told me my prayers had been answered and a case was on its way last week. After inspecting the case to make sure all cans were on hand and in great shape I began my personal journey. I have now concluded that Heady Topper is far and away the finest quality beer made, should be deemed a national treasure and is the best tasting Imperial IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. As smooth as a great brew could be with hints of grapefruit,1st rate hops, blood orange citrus, delicate cream and subtle pine. I am truly fortunate to be able to share my case of Heady with my beer friends and hope you are able to find a way to get a few cans to savor yourself. Please let me know when you have finished your first can, if you feel the way I do send me a personal note. Cheers to all!","Azureblue","Aug 10, 2013"

Taste is a mix of citrus fruit, tangerine, orange grapefruit, a little bit of white grape, assertive bitterness throughout but never tastes to bitter, certainly more hop flavour here as opposed to hop bitterness, a light sweetness present before a long dry hoppy finish. Lightly carbonated, oily and quite slick, medium-full body.

Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a top two or three DIPA that is truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)!","JohnG190","Jul 21, 2013"

However, I popped the top, and it immediately smelled like I was in the middle of Shenandoah Valley. One of my favorite places to go hiking/camping with my dad. Heady is clean, slightly piney, sweetly floral, and rather bright in aroma. The taste is really light for the 8% ABV. A great hop presence on the tongue, and sweet/bitter combination from the malt/hops. Surprisingly, the piney-ness of the hops isn’t bothering me. I typically don’t like that in my IPAs, and tend to stick towards brighter/more tropical offerings. Short duration on the tongue, which is making me drink this beer faster than I normally would have.

The balance that is struck between the hops alone is incredible and beautiful, with sticky sweet fruity nectars and citrus battling, blending, and then giving way to a stronger herbal component through the finish shows variability throughout the sip, punch at each stop, and precise progression along the palate. The fact that it took us over an hour to rate this guy, and across several cans no less, speaks to both its complexity and depth, as well as to its utterly simple and remarkable ease of drinkability. The mouthfeel is smooth, frothy, sticky to the lips, and coating, striking just the right combination to keep your mouth and buds wanting more, more, and more. While every aspect of this masterpiece shines, it is the taste that stays with you the most, and will, at least for the next few nights to come, keep us up at night thinking about it.","TheBrewo","Jun 26, 2013"

You can tell there is malt in there, but good luck finding a flavor description to attach to it. Just a massive tidal wave of hops - citric, tropical, piney; you name it hop-wise, its here. ABV is well hidden and the flow is nice from the hop flavor to the bitter finish...not halting at all. Definitely a world class beer, good enough to say that if I was transferred to Vermont for work, regualr access to this would be one of the first things to pop into my mind.","twiggamortis420","Jun 12, 2013"

No doubt, having regular access to Heady is one of the greatest joys of living in Vermont. That said, I recognize the danger of the hype surrounding a beer like Heady. I have not drank nearly enough beer--let alone DIPAs--in my life to claim to know what is and is not the best beer--or IPA--in the world. What I can say is that, before first trying Heady Topper on my 21st birthday thanks to a couple generous friends, I absolutely loathed anything IPA, having preferred stouts and the maltier side of the beer spectrum. I never understood the so-called """hopheads""" when all I could taste was overt bitterness and strange combinations of malts and hops. I suspect the primary culprit is the inability of lesser breweries to achieve an ideal hop-malt balance. To this day I still cannot finish most IPAs and DIPAs. Regardless, the perfect score I've given is due to the fact that Heady made me love hops and IPAs. It is undoubtedly the best beer I've had in my short life of drinking and it would be my choice for the only beer to drink for the rest of my life. I plan on staying in Vermont as long as possible to realize this possibility. That said, don't listen to the hype, try it for yourself. Even if you don't think it's God's gift to man, few can discount that its a treat to enjoy at least once.","BTVflatlander","May 30, 2013"

The combination of hop bitterness and citrus flavor with a great mouthfeel make it nearly a perfect beer. I first tried HT back in December and since then have been yearning for more. I have tried to consume more available IPAs but nothing has compared, even other world class beers such as Double Trouble and LagunitasSucks. So today I went up to VT with some friends and picked up 6 cases. No more worrying for me. Its a shame more cannot try this great beer.","putnam118","May 27, 2013"

It does come together in a better way which I definitely appreciate. It's hoppy as hell though in a very non-subtle manner, though not as much as Abrasive is. Pliny is hoppy in a more subtle way- mainly in the aroma and flavour (intense grapefruit and citrus), but not so much the bitter aftertaste like Heady gets that starts burning off my palate. Very excellent DIPA, just a bit behind Pliny and Abrasive in my book. (4.5)","Stevedore","May 10, 2013"

This is really good, but best consumed fresh - it becomes more piney and funky over time, and loses a lot of its fresh squeezed juicy flavors that I enjoy in the style.

4.92,4,4.5,5,5,5,4.75,"It poured out a bit murky- I expected it to have been filtered, but the color was a nice golden orange. The aroma was a prelude to nice balance. Exactly what is to be expected from an exquisite IPA- rich pine, citrus and apricot all in a perfect blend- and in that order! The taste was very smooth. I only had two gulps so I had to make them count! Like I said the aromas were a prelude to the taste and it tasted very predictable (which is good) and inviting. The rich flavor profile and dynamic masks the alcohol which is very nice too. I just wish it was filtered to get a more acute, pure flavor without the murk masking anything. The aluminum in the can added to the brightness of flavor. Very close to Pliny the Younger, which nobody could help but compare it to. What makes this slightly inferior was that it is nearly 4% less ABV than Younger and not as smooth. So there. Can't wait for another can! The hunt is on.","tastyville","May 07, 2013"

I've never had a beer that really harnessed raw hop character as well as this beer. Smelling this beer is really like sticking your head inside a dry hop bag after home brewing. Alchemist's house yeast """Conan", really shines with it's peach forward esters. Truly magical stuff. While I don't prefer this beer over Pliny(mainly because Pliny is just so damn balanced, crisp and refreshing), this still is a beer every Hop Head should experience. Plus it's in a can!

To find out they were sold out. Sold out. What brewery sells out? One that has great beer! Had a sample, it was good, went home. Returned a month later, bought a couple of cases, sent some to friends, all are happy. I've tried from both can and glass. From the can, it has a bit sharper taste/feel. What I didnt like from the can is that you couldnt smell it as well. From the glass, a bit less carbonated, much better smell, and an excellent drink. Color? Who cares? Cloudy, very little sediment. You dont look at it, you drink it! You CANNOT have just one to make a review. Give your palette time. Have 3 or 4 (yes, its ok!!) and then review it. This beer gets better each and every time. As someone else said, its like biting into a grapefruit, and like the can says, its wave after wave of hoppyness. Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Be patient, get a 4 pack, and do an informed review. You wont be disappointed! I can't wait for my next road trip! And... they are compassionate!

So, I poured 80% into a glass and left the rest in the can. After it hit the glass, I understood the desire for the can. The unfiltered, resin-floating view was less than flattering. But, I figured, two million people can't all be wrong. So I took a whiff, and enjoyed the crisp, apricot notes coming back at me. Nothing piney, no citrus, just clean. Next was where the rubber meets the road - the taste. My wife summed it up best, when she said """wow, an IPA I wouldn't have to pair with food to drink!""" I absolutely agree. It's perfectly brewed, and is surely the best, most balanced IPA I've ever had. First taste threatens to turn into piney hops in your mouth, yet never does. It just slides away, leaving you with a tasty, refreshing treat that doesn't stay past its welcome. Now I know why this is such a revered brew, and why people love to have more than one at a time. It's just that inviting, and one I wish was closer to me in availability.","yankeepride","Apr 07, 2013"

As an avid IPA fan, I've been around the block the a few times and this was like the first time I had an IPA. Literally have tasted nothing like it before. However, my goodness, this beer made me full and bloated. Anything but drinkable. I got through the can just fine, but I did not want another. Also, the appearance of the beer in my glass is one of the worst I have seen. Even a shaken up belgium beer isn't this bad. Not sure if that's necessary to achieve the hop profile or not, but seems a bit sloppy to me. Def worth checking out and a fantastic world class brew, one like I have never experienced before.

Nose was citrus - grapefruit, mango and pineapple along with some pine, grassiness and floral elements. Taste followed with big citrus flavors, especially grapefruit and orange, but with a biscuity, caramel malt for balance. Bitterness was there but not overwhelming. It predominates in the aftertaste as well, along with pine oil and honey. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. There is little to no alcohol burn. I can understand why so many people love this beer…it was great…just not my all-time favorite, as it is for so many.","regspeir","Mar 17, 2013"

I personally would choose any of those over this one as my favorite IPA. That said, the shear raw hoppiness of this one merits that it is in the discussion of the best. This one is a delightfully hoppy beer, but not one that kills you with high intensity, more like a gradual roll up of juicy flavors. I appreciate the complexity and quality flavor without the excessive bitterness. I would get this again if I can find it. Well worth the hype.","tigg924","Mar 04, 2013"

I would 100% purchase a case of this beer. In fact, I will probably now make that trip north this month if possible. I mean, what a fantastic beer.

You won't need a gallon of water to get rid of the hoppy taste in the back of your mouth. Despite being an 8% ABV Imperial IPA, this is a highly drinkable beer. It also helps that it comes in a can and it's a year round beer and not a once in a blue moon type of beer that you need to trade your first born for. Would I drink it again? I would if I could find a steady supply of it. I have to thank my good friend Vince for hooking me up with this treat.","AltBock","Feb 26, 2013"

I now understand why this is currently ranked #1 in the world in all style categories. Take Pliny The Elder as good as it is and kick it up a notch & you have Heady Topper. The only reason it is not possible for this beer to attain a perfect score is due to the fact that it is by far the ugliest DIPA one will ever encounter. However, the ugliness grows on you and it works.

Well, it'd be hard to say whether I like HT """better""" than any of them, because despite being a Double IPA, it is still vastly discernible from the rest.

This is an awesomely hoppy-smelling beer with notes of candy and tropical fruit (maybe even peach?). The first thing I tasted was the roasty, nutty malts followed by a bitter punch in the mouth! The finish is fruity, falling somewhere between papaya and peach. What I found most surprising was the creamy, soft mouthfeel. This is to date the best beer I've ever had.

Nose brings bright juicy citrus (mandarin, grapefruit) pineapple, slight floral pine, very juice and a hoppy earthiness. This beer reminds me alot of Nelson - big tropical notes and juicy with pine dankiness play a small secondary roll. The taste brings bitter papaya, lime rind, light caramel malts and some pine needle covered forest floor - as it warms almost an herbal, minty licorice note comes out.

Drink-ability for this amount of hops is outstanding. Hard to get to all the hop flavours in such a complicated hopped beer, but that is ok, this isn't about sipping an Imperial Stout till you get to the bottom of the complexity.... the Alchemist set out to make a perfectly hoppy, drinkable IPA and have surely succeeded where many others fail.

Pours a hazy amber/straw in color with a pretty standard white head and pretty good lacing, points for the cool can as well. The smell fills the room even from the can resiny, piney, and citrus hops with tropical notes, pretty much any hop smell you can think of rolled into one. Taste of pure hop juice for me, not overly bitter but the can describes it best """wave after wave of hop goodness", there are also some malts in there if you try really hard to notice them. The mouthfeel is not all that heavy, the 8% abv is not noticeable at all and if you have access to this one it can be drank can after can. This can was exactly 1 week old.","dickieb","Jan 03, 2013"

The first thing you notice as you pop the top is the wonderful aroma, ton of oranges, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. It pours a deep orange, moderate white head, big chunky floaters. The flavor is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, bitter pine. IMO the hoppiest beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The body is medium, some noticeable booze, decent carbonation. Great DIPA, pretty much lives up to hype.","bonkers","Nov 25, 2012"

Heady-Topper is that beer you lust after when you want to satiate your desire for complex hop acidity but don't want rubber-tongue the rest of the night. That's not to say the hops won't burn you, because they will. It's just that this beer offers so much more and balances things well with light, delicate, yet effective, usage of malts.

I did previously have one poured into a glass.... which the apperance is hazy gold with hop leaves floating around and white sticky head. Sicne I'm reviewing this from the can, I will be generous with appearance since the can has a pretty cool look. The aroma is bright and citrusy with loads of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The aroma emanates freely from the mouth opening which gives me a nice bit of aroma (which I was expecting to be restrained from the can). The taste is delicious... the hops all come together and features a nice fruity/citrus profile. Notes of mango, apricot, and grapefruit come through with minimal bitterness. A touch of cream even comes through which really unifies the flavors. Almost no bitterness on the finish. The 8% ABV is dangerously undetectable. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonation which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a delicious IPA. I recently had a less than fresh can...and I must say the fresh can really shines and pops with flavor. Well worth seeking out.","homebrew311","Nov 19, 2012"

Great coloration, and the remains that come out of the can at the end add even more flavor. The aftertaste is not bitter at all, and leaves a very nice, non bitter flavor. Drinking it out of the can is definitely the best way to drink, though out of the tap is certainly right up there (Proabition Pig in Waterbury Vermont)Visiting Vt is a great thing right now for Beer lovers. Hill Farmstead and Lawsons are also right up there with their double IPA's as well. But neither can keep up with Heady...","jbellows","Nov 01, 2012"

Appearance wise it is cloudy with a grainy foamy head. Not overly pretty but i know this is meant to be drunk straight out of a can, so i wont hold that against them. Hops hit the nose straight away in a big american way, citrusy, piney, tropical, but underneath it all is a reasuring earthy malt base. Tastes a lot like it smells. A bunch of wonderful things coming together in a way that isnt completely cohesive, but complimentary enough that you can enjoy everything together or pick out the various delicious elements, like a farmers market salad. Really, really like this. its got a nice oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation and finishes clean and moreish. taste well rounded, complete, refreshing a little raw, but in a surprisingly endearing way.

Aromas on popping the can are strong and abundant. Beautifully balanced oregano-spiced hops roll out, with a strong resiny background and malty sweet backbone. Smells amazing. I poured about a half a tumbler so I could see any head formation, and boy is there. The beer is a slightly hazed, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that is an inch and a half and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Flavors are roasted in the backbone, with a rich, resiny, bitter hops presence that just overflows the palate. The hops spicing is more subtle than the nose was, which works out very well in the total package. Citrus characters roll out across the palate the more you drink, with an undertone of grapefruit tart and bitterness. Delicious. Wet hops flavors are abundant from the initial taste across the board into the aftertaste. Rich, full bodied, and extremely smooth, which supports all of the flavor profiles. The finish is bitter and slightly drying, with a clean overall feel. This beer is fantastic. The more you drink, the more layers of hops flavor reveal themselves. Amazing.

I can name 5 or 6 new imperial IPA's I've tried locally that are better crafted than this (Super IPA, The Pupil, this year's batch of summer YuleSmith to name a few). And they don't need to hide in a can. This points to a geographical bias that I've suspected of BeerAdvocate for some time...I'm sorry, but there's no way this is better than Pliny the Elder or any number of Alpine's IPA's. That being said, this shouldn't be reviewed against expectations. If I was handed this blind - say, in a keg cup so you don't see the crazy complexion - I'd be talking about it all night. It delivers on all the levels a fan of imperial IPA's expect (other than appearance).

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, fruit, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, earth, and fruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I am so excited I was finally able to try this one now that they can it. Wow! What a beer it was… It had some aspects that reminded me of Gubna, but had a huge amount of balance going on to keep your palate nice and happy so it did not succumb to a palate hop onslaught. Very well balanced and inviting after each sip.

I wish I could somehow do a head-to-head comparison between this and Pliny the Elder (it's been so long since I've had it), but living in Kentucky makes it nearly impossible to get both beers fresh at the same time.

4.47,-5.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"an affordable can at farmhouse tap in burlington. they say drink it from the can, but i poured it for more careful study. it looks lovely, hazy, definitely unfiltered. radiant hay color with thick white suds floating on top that leave some mean lacing as it drinks. smells like quite the hop bouquet. grapefruit and spruce are the most prominent hop esters im picking up, but there are many. it tastes like it smells, deep and complex, worthy of patient consumption. its fruity, in addition to citrus there is also nectarine and mandarin orange on my tongue. its got upbeat carbonation which keeps its oily medium taffy sticky body moving along. the aftertaste is long and bittersweet, as it should be. alcohol is well hidden in taste, but can certainly be felt. this is one hell of a big ipa, and i dont want to hear anymore debate about pliny/heady, because both are outstanding and distinct brews, and that should suffice for all of us.","StonedTrippin","Aug 27, 2012"

IPAs are my favorite style of beer, but I usually find DIPAs to be too strongly tasting of alcohol. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable despite its high alcohol content and potent hopping. The smell of the heady topper alone is delicious, and the taste is even better, with passionfruit, mango, and piney hop aromas. The heady topper delivers the ultimate hops experience!","AriRock","Aug 06, 2012"

4.94,4.4,4,5,5,5,5,"This is incredible stuff, this beer was drank mostly from the can... only poured a sample of it out to enjoy the orange yellow color of it with a nice looking white head on top. Had a nice unfiltered cloudiness to it also. The smell of the beer is very hoppy, lots of pine aromas in it with the delicate floral and citrusy notes in there as well. The taste is probably worthy of a 5.5 honestly. There is no doubt that this has some of the best transitions of flavors I've had from any IPA. There is a huge rush of floral sweet citrus notes on the tongue in the very beginning, as the liquid settles there is a very subtle burst of malts on the tongue right before the aggressive pine resin starts to claw away at your taste buds. The mouthfeel is smoothly carbonated making this beer very easy to drink, it's medium bodied and has a nice dry finish to it. Overall this is something very special, The people up at Alchemist aren't screwing around here, they are setting out to make the best IPA in the world and I would say that they just might have it. This is a beer I would drive to Vermont to get cases of. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to drinking the next 3 in the pack.","Knapp85","Aug 01, 2012"

I preface, this offering is being tasted on an afternoon where, sometime following this review i will be trying my first Pliny TE (having arrived simultaneously).. Heady Topper: As a lover of American craft brew for 3 years and having tried, in my mind, a good deal of DIPA's (considering I didn't become a craft beer advocate until relocating to Texas oddly enough), I am more than enthusiastic about this tasting.The hop bouquet is blowing my mind, and in a well-balanced way. Expectations of this beer are met and slightly exceeded (they were phenomenal expectations prior to sampling). Pineapple/ citrusy greatness abounds. With this beer it seems as if I've never appreciated the mouthfeel of this style until now. There is no drawback here. Tasty beyond belief. Balance is impeccable, yet i need to stress how the hops flourish here... is this Simcoe and Citra? Well i dont know, that I wonder though. Anyway out of curiosity I poured a bit less than 1/4 of the can into a Chimay chalice for a visual. I really appreciate an unfiltered IPA made well (prior to this my affinity was for the now-shelved DFH Squall). Im liking the look of murky golden when I know everything else about it is sublime. The lacing with Heady is incredible, and again lacing is something I continue to appreciate but with this beer in a glass it was sticky city (and this from a beerman who spot cleans his glassware well). But yes I have to agree with the brewmastery of Alchemist where the recommendation is to drink from the can. Yes you will surely love it in glassware, but if you love true hop heaven, you will be best to press lips to aluminum.","TBoneJones","Jul 20, 2012"

4.94,4.4,4,5,5,5,5," I am a big fan of IPA's and this double IPA does not disapoint. The taste is fantastic, at 8% you don't taste any alcohol that you would expect at a 8% ABV. The reason is the hops, you definitely taste hops, very crisp clean taste of citrus and pine, but very fresh at the back end, it doesn't have the bad sour after taste like some IPA's. I definitely do recomend you listen to the brewer and drink it out of a can, you just don't get the same experience out of a glass, which makes me wonder if I would order it at a bar, but probably I would because even out of a glass you would be getting a fantastic beer. I was skeptical about all the hype that this beer was getting, but I have to say this product definitley lives up to it. I'm never good at picking a favorite anything, but this would definitely be in my top 3, an absolute must try.","middletonman2001","Jul 16, 2012"

5,5.7,5,5,5,5,5,"I had one beer out of the can and one poured out. The poured one is very cloudy like a hefe. Put it up to your nose and it may burn your eyebrows off it's so hoppy. First sip, pungent, piney hop flavor, balanced with the sweet citrus, but also tastes creamy like a hefe, whereas a lot of IPAs taste thinner. Nice thing about this beer is that some IPAs lose their hoppiness the closer you get to the end of your glass. Not this one. As the advertising says, wave after wave of hoppiness till the finish. Very very enjoyable, if you have a free weekend and don't mind road trips, go seek this beer out. Bring some coolers to keep it cold on the ride home!","dashmartino","Jul 07, 2012"

Their was a slight bitterness from the hops, but the aromatic hops cut right through that creating an extremely well balanced DIPA. Though the hops are definitely the star, I really appreciate the malty sweetness of this beer as well. An amazing beer and I can't wait to get another can of this ale.","isawpalmetto","Jul 06, 2012"

The first sip delivers what you get in the nose, an amazing burst of fresh, citrus hops with wonderful floral notes. The biscuit continues to act as a great balance and the bitterness you'd expect never exerts its dominance. This is truly an extremely drinkable IPA. How they deliver the aroma and the flavors of the hops as successfully as they do without ratcheting the IBUs into the stratosphere is incredible. I'd love to see more IPAs built on this blueprint. Don't get me wrong; every now and then I want something that will destroy my palate, but I know that I can only drink one or two of them and then not much of anything else.

Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a sturdy white cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass.. Pungent citrus pineapple aroma with solid sweet, sticky malt and orange beneath and just the slightest hint of booze. The aroma almost has a feel to it. Like hop resin and dust in the sinuses. Amazing. Thick and chewy feel with dense, rich carbonation that lazily rolls through. Pungent citrus hop flavor from start to finish that are propped up by a strong sweet malty backbone.. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness with a touch of citrus bitterness and booze.","IronLover","Jul 03, 2012"

Drinking it from the glass made for a good hoppy IPA. Drinking this beer from the can made for a completely different beer. Much more of the hop character seemed to stay with the can and as for drinkability.... It was almost unfair. This is easily the most drinkable IPA I have ever had.

The taste is as expected, hop forward. Snappy, pine, citrus, chewy hops. Then some more hops. Not so bitter, actually much more of a fruity hop affair.

Pours a very cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The aroma is big mango, floral notes, light caramel, a bit of pineapple, and some sugar cookie. The initial taste is sweet with mango and pineapple going into a bit of caramel, sugar cookie, and some light dankness. There is a very light bitterness on finish along with some lingering mango. Light bodied. Low carbonation. I definitely could use a bit more bitterness and a bit less sweetness. Not bad, but certainly not in the class of the best west coast IPAs.","jethrodium","May 08, 2012"

There's about a finger and a half of cream colored foam crowning the beer, and head retention is just OK. Lacing is fairly nice though, more of the glass is left covered in it than not. The second pour does result in plenty of sediment hanging in suspension. The nose is absolutely wonderful. Tons of mango and pineapple, with some more overtly citrusy grapefruit present in more of a supporting role. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of candied sugar sweetness. The bitterness that rolls through next is surprisingly mild/smooth. I kind of wish it was a little bit more intense/attention grabbing. The hoppy close though is just as fantastic as the nose though, with tons of tropical fruit and just a ittle bit of citrus. The mouthfeel is spot on. The body's not quite Belgian style brew dry, but it has just a little bit more heft to support it. Meanwhile, the carbonation explodes on my palate, helping the potent hoppy flavors to come alive. Heady Topper's a stunning beer, and one of the abslute best double IPAs I've had to date.","axeman9182","Apr 30, 2012"

Taste: I’d say it is the best tasting double IPA I’ve ever had. Flavors are very coherent with the aroma. Definitly hops at its best. The perfect level of bitterness with a sharp citrus touch.

Thanks to my brother (Mitchell) for going way out of the way to pick up a case while in Vermont. While I will agree with many that Heady will not be winning any awards for appearance, it certainly deserves ever bit of its rating on BA. Heady Topper is definitely one of the best IIPA’s I have ever drank in my life. The hops come in waves and while it never overpowers you it continuously lets you know you are drinking an IIPA. It is scary because it is so drinkable that I could throw back a few of these without hesitation but at 8% is will definitely let you know you have been drinking. It starts off with wave after wave of piney citrus hops in the nose. The hops are present but very drinkable with the same piney citrus mouth feel. This beer is unbelievable as sip after sip coats your mouth with a wave of hops. This beer is definitely better cold as it looses some of the wonderful characteristics as it warms.

Smells so fresh and hoppy...pineapple, grapefruit, melon, pine sap, guava, orange, lemon...SO INVITING. Taste is lacking in the malt profile...which is GREAT! Being from the west coast, this is just what I like. A little bit of malt, but not enough to make this delicious brew lose any points. Lovely citrus and tropical fruit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. No lingering bitterness with this beer...crisp and clean. The palate is miraculously wiped clean after a few seconds of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavor, and crisp finish. Drinkability is Very High. ABV not even noticeable.

It is not overwhelmingly hoppy for the style, but the hop flavors work very well with the dominating citrus and tropical fruits. The finish and aftertaste are a remarkable blend of bitter and sweet. I was able to keep myself to only consuming two tonight, but I easily could have drank all four. A beer deserving of its world class rating that I will certainly seek out in future trades. It is not the hoppiest or biggest, but it is damn near the best. I highly recommend it.","NoLeafClover44","Apr 05, 2012"

Citrus, pine, and resin aromas dominate on the nose. Taste? Oh dear god. HOPS. I could say that there's a light amount of caramel malts, but it's really a secondary flavor to the absurd amount of DELICIOUS hops in here. It's nowhere near overly bitter, instead just providing an absolutely delicious, resiny hop experience with so many layers. The mouthfeel is fairly light and goes down very easily. The drinkability is absurdly good, I can crush this down like it's a 5% pale ale. If you like IPAs, you HAVE to experience this beer, at any cost. It's absolutely fantastic. World class.

Hoping that this becomes more available in MA, because as of now, there are only a few places that you can enjoy this ‘world-class’ brew.

I get to enjoy this usually every month or so, and simply put: it's the best out there. I've had it 7 days old and 7 months old. Nothing beats it fresh but even after half a year it still tastes incredible. Pour half in a snifter and enjoy half in the can. The smell upon cracking that can will blow you away. Definitely my favorite double IPA out there and probably my favorite overall. It will never get old. The hype is real! If you have a chance to get your hands on this, do so...by any means possible.

The rest of this review will be from the can. The aroma is huge and heavy as soon as you crack the beer. Tons of tropical citrus hop character assault your senses. I guess I should have expected as much from the 120 IBUs. I can't tell how this beer could smell any better: no hint of alcohol and an overload of hops. Perfect. The taste build on the aroma, if that is even possible, you again are assaulted with the tropical citrus hop flavor and yet a bit of piney resin is prevalent, too. Unbelievably smooth. Unreal how balanced this beer is. Malty sweetness with fruity character from the hops. Clean. Smooth. Medium bitterness, not over the top, no clue this is 8%abv. Amazing flavor. Again, not sure how this can get any better. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and rich and smooth. Very well balanced. Overall, this beer is phenomenal.

With this beer - picture drinking a milkshake out of a big straw vs drinking right from the glass. The can is the straw - you get more of a concentrated blast of taste vs from the glass. Perhaps it is because there is no aroma preview, so to speak. The various aspects of the flavor previously described seem more together, hitting me at once instead of in stages this way. The sweetness seems to stick around longer and the resinous aspect seems less earthy and more spicy, more organic. Delicious orange rind dominates. Changing this to a perfect score.

But, it seems almost inherently clear that this is more or less the pinnacle of one of those points in the spectrum. There’s undoubtedly other beers at least as enjoyable with different flavor and aroma profiles, maybe more citrusy and fruity or whatever, but they’re not better or worse so much as different. Like a pantheon of pinnacle (d)IPAs. And this almost certainly has a seat in that pantheon. Waxing poetic, maybe, so let me put it differently: this beer is totally tits.

Super accessible for those out there who think they don't dig IPA, but also hoppy enough to keep the hopheads happy. A really refreshing dIPA, which isn't a way I'd characterize many of the others I've had. Full of bright, exciting flavor.

I can't really judge the appearance this way, but the can has a cool design. The smell is a certain citrusy aroma with hints of the can mixed in the smell. The taste is perhaps the most balanced DIPA. the hops are not overpowering, and the flavor is exceptionally complex. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, and a sour hop flavor come to the forefront. The most remarkable element is the smooth mouthfeel. One might even say it goes down soft. The aftertaste does not limit the experience, but takes it in a different direction. The citrusy flavors sweeten like candy. Most DIPAs express punch of bitter hops at this point, so this was surprising and refreshing.

I really would say for my taste these 3 would b interchangeable as far as which one I like best. Number ratings don't tell how even they are. I drank from a glass on the first one can the next two. Looks great as fresh world class DIPA should, nice foam and you can get lost with your nose in the glass. Citrus, and lost of it, smooth hops, and a lot of that too, On my 1st can I was thinking of Pliny in a way to compare, but after having a few over the last few days I'm changing that up a bit. It comes on first sip like Pliny, then somewhere along the line the overwhelming hops kicks in and it's more similar to Alpines Pure Hoppiness. Nicely bitter, but not crushingly so, balanced as hell. Just a tremendous brew, surely equal to anything brewed anywhere that's a DIPA. It this was easily available I'd be 300 lbs.","nc41","Dec 22, 2011"

It's like drinking the nectar of the gods. Seriously, that good. I must say, though, that this is fantastic when fresh, but if you don't have it fresh it's not nearly as good. Over my dozen cans, the beer fell off after a couple of weeks. Silly me drank them over 3 weeks. The first week it was a religious experience, and by the last one it was only as good as any other world class DIPA. You could probably age this and it'd be great, but do drink fresh if you can. Giving it a 5/5 because it is tops on my list. If something dethrones this, I'll knock it down a notch. For now, this is as close to perfect as a DIPA can get in my opinion.","nrs207","Dec 07, 2011"

As a die hard IPA/DIPA chasing the latest and greatest available to me I just have to say this beer is a double edge sword. This IPA is so fantastic, that if it is not readily available to you and you are a diehard hophead I and others I know would nearly recommend not trying this beer and especially if you do not have more than a couple in your possesion. This beer has nearly ruined many other IPAs and DIPAs for me, I still enjoy them, but this has clearly set the standard. Also, I truly agree, do drink from the can, it is better than in a glass. I look forward to my first from a tap though. Warning over, onto my brief review. This beer bursts with grapefruit, citrus, lemon? white fruit and some very clean pine. Just amazing flavors that seem to change as you go through the can. The malt backbone is right where Ilike it in a beer of this strength. Its subtle but full arriving just before the fruit of the hops set in and leaves just in time for the bitterness to take over and make you want more. I try to limit myself to one of these per session so that it remains so special. As a last note, I do not know what hops are in this beer but I think columbus and cascade are here, for all I know there are many more.","NHcraftbeer","Nov 10, 2011"

Pours a brilliant golden orange with a mad amount of hop floaties (the only part of the beer I wasn't thrilled with). Aroma is out of this world. My favorite kind of red grapefruit juice and tropical fruit candy. Flavor matches the nose in a pretty straight forward but completely complementing way. It's a whole mouth filling fruit forward hop flavor that I really dug. The slightly viscosity of the liquid was very nice in the mouth and carried the flavor well. Overall I'm just thrilled.

I've rarely seen a better looking DIPA, smelled a finer flower, nor tasted anything as hoppy and honeyed. I'm not sure what kind of black magic this brewery dabbles in, but this beer is a incantatory balance of hop and malt. It's sweet (but just right), it's hoppy and piney, resin-y, and brilliantly citrus-y. If I ever have an imperial IPA better than this, I might just call it the best I could ever have. I'm serious.","JChristopher","Nov 08, 2011"

5,5.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Went against the recommendation and poured this puppy up. Deep caramel orange enhanced haziness from hop residues. Immediately the smell is a citrus bomb. This beer combines so many great citrus notes. It is as if the fruit is from some hybrid tree that only grows in Vermont. I would say the grapefruit is the star though. Crisp taste with some tangy bites. Very fresh hop notes. The mouth feel is almost as impressive as the taste. This is almost described as creamy to my palate.

It's complex. I pull the citrus immediately and just a touch of booziness comes across the palate with the initial swill. The booze quickly dissipates and hops take over. I couldn't tell you what hops are used, why they are used, or what characteristics they impart on this beer but I can tell you that the mix is right and this beer is delicious. I want more of them and I want them now. The best way to describe this beer is fresh and unique.

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. There is a bitterness finish, but it is pleasant, aromatic and not harsh at all. Tried this out of a can, but ended up too dangerously drinkable that way.","CuriousMonk","Oct 19, 2011"

Sweet, juicy, ripe aroma of grapefruit and pineapple, with grass, pine and citrus rind balancing out the profile. Thicker side of medium body, chewy and oily on the palate with a resiny and pulpy finish. Strong bready malt body hides underneath the rich, fresh, intense hop flavor. Much more resiny and pulpy than the aroma, grapefruit and pine flavors dominate. Finish is dry and remarkably smooth.

I may have to move to Vermont in the near future. It also scores extra point for coming in a 16 oz can which is by far the best packaging around. My new philosophy is 6 pack 12 oz bottles need to go away and 4 pack 16 oz cans need to take over; it just makes way too much sense on so many levels. Nice tangent there, anyway this is the best DIPA I have ever had, worth seeking out and highly recommended. I hope all is well and things get back on track because their brewery was damaged during Hurricane Irene and I know they had to shut down for a while.

The flavors too are a combination of grapefruit and pineapple with a moderate amount of bitterness and a clean finish. It's just so intensely hoppy. Like the description says, it is wave after wave of hoppy goodness. It drinks well, both from a glass or out of the can. It's just a really nice beer through and through. I'm really glad I got to try this one.","aasher","Oct 11, 2011"
4.55,-3.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a hazed golden amber color with good cap of soapy white bubbles, good retention and lacing. Scent hits the nose with a big rush of tropical and citrus fruits... grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange... slight presence of malt, finishes with a hint of grass. Taste starts off with a quick little bitter punch but quickly moves into a cocktail of tropical fruit with light citrus, again a faint presence of malt and a grassy and piney note at the end. Medium bodied, good carbonation, lacking some oily body preferred in the style. Overall, fantastic scent and taste make this beer highly drinkable and a great IPA.","rfgetz","Oct 11, 2011"

The nose is a combination of tropical fruit and pine smell that comes together in a very encouraging and welcoming fashion. The hop flavor combination is unusual in that it almost combines into the suggestion of a light mint tea. The taste is that same killer combination of tropical and pine flavors, and a good background malt base that is in balance with the hops. Lighter in body and sweetness than some DIPAs, but not dry, this achieves a good balance. Good carbonation. This is a really good DIPA and another to add to the list of 'must trys' for the hop head. Not brutally bitter, but a fantastically interesting hop flavor. Had this right after Hill Farmstead Double Citra and they were right on par with each other and fairly similar.","seeswo","Oct 10, 2011"

Resinous dank pine hops barely let any malt come through, but some do find their way in. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel.

Pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with a rocky, one inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some swaths and spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer - grassy, sweet citrus, earthy rind and a slight peppery quality towards the back; incredibly well-balanced. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness presents up-front and sweet citrus and a suggestion of apricot follows. Finish leaves a slight residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation that is lively without being prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it. Hopefully it will make it to Southern Vermont so I can get a bit more regular access. This beer is nothing short of fantastic - the balance is top notch, the alcohol is well-hidden and it is just so easy drinking. In my opinion, can tops bottle on this brew.","Jwale73","Sep 15, 2011"

4,-15.4,2,4.5,4,4,4,"Malt is more noticeable on the palate, lending a bread-like backbone that's quickly washed away by an assault of hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, pineapple and papaya flavors try their hardest to balance a huge resinous hop bitterness. This is dry and light, decidedly West Coast style, with a lower to moderate level of carbonation. The bitterness grows astringent after a while, and while I do appreciate high IBUs, I feel that in this case it's out of balance with the hop flavor. It's an excellent DIPA nonetheless, and one of the best hoppy beers I've had from the East Coast.","largadeer","Dec 15, 2010"

It has its differences from PtE, but that is why I would freaking love to have both of these in my refrigerator at the same time. So similar yet so different. My first experience from The Alchemist and a hugely positive one at that. As stated, very glad I was able to try this.

This is up there with some of the best smelling IPAs made. Pineapple, sweet malts, tropical fruit, not a hint of bitterness - just wonderful aroma hops. Taste is surprisingly different from the smell, and this isnt a bad thing. Pineapple and tropical fruit flavor but with a bit more bitterness then I was expecting, some biscuit malt (not a lot, just enough to provide balance), a slightly spicy, earthy hop finish. The lighter side of medium body with a medium light carbonation, finishes very clean. This is an excellent IPA and hands down the best one to come from anywhere east of California. Very different then the west coasters in terms of flavor, but much smoother and more drinkable then Pliny or some of the other notables.

At 8.0%, it's not nearly as bold in the ethanol department as some of those, though (which is to its credit), but I would gladly accept this one at 9%, 10%, or even 11% if it could just amp up the sweetness and the bitterness a little. I know the back of the bottle says that this beer isn't aiming to be the biggest, or the strongest, or the most bitter, but the flavor combination is great enough that, with a little extra thrust, this one could be the world's best DIPA. On the whole, though, I was really impressed with this one and thrilled to try it - Heady Topper is the best non-Bell's DIPA (HopSlam, Oracle, and Big Head all top it) that I've had brewed outside California ... and that's sayin' something.","CrellMoset","Dec 12, 2010"

The aroma was big and spicy, full of aggressive hops and a musty quality almost like armpit odor. I know that sounds awful but I was blown away by how much smell was emitting from this beer. The flavors were equally huge. A deep hop profile of pine, grapefruit and kumquat with some white pepper and similar spiciness was balanced nicely by the malt sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. The finish was again hoppy with edgy notes of bitter resin and some lemon zest. It was almost like a wet-hopped beer with the drinkability of good American Brown Ale because the alcohol was so well hidden.

Aroma lets no one forget this isn't called an imperial IPA for nothing, it's shouting """hops""" to the hills. Taste was pleasantly of pale malts, and then the hops came through the swinging doors and took everyone out. Crisp, heavy, hops bitterness, and I swear I could see a hops oil slick on the surface, but maybe that was just me. Mouthfeel and drinkability are as expected of the style, if it's your thing, you're good to go, and if not, you're one-and-done. Meets the style to a T. A must have from The Alchemist.","ppoitras","Apr 24, 2004"
4.2,-11.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the Alchemist brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Damn, 8% ABV and 120 IBU's, but totally smooth and tasty. Amber color with a low white bubbly head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Smooth and even mouthfeel leads to an intense flavor of pineapple and orange peel hops with a hint of peaches. The ABV is subtle and not overpowering at all. A fine web of lacing dances around the inside of the glass. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire glass. This one is real tasty and I ripped through it because I couldn't stand the thought of it not rolling over my taste buds for more than a few seconds.","far333","Mar 31, 2004"
4.97,5.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Served a pale amber with a small light head. Hops are the flavor of choice here, but they are done right. Such a yummy bite. Actually does live up to it's name as the hops are strong enough to give off the heady within the buzz. Hops are not overly complex, yet not too simple either. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Served only in 12oz glasses, the abv is not at all apparent. Sooo smooth. I'm sad that El Jefe is no longer on the menu, but I'd take the Heady Topper over the chief anyday.","scottum","Mar 26, 2004"
