"Great beer, not as hoppy as I thought, but just enough to make it a great beer."
"A little malty but that supports the abv. Not as intimidating as I thought it would be, dangerously good to drink."
""
""
""
"I'm not into really hoppy beer,  but I have to give this one credit for its honesty. Hoppy smell with a fruity/hoppy kick that evolves into a lingering bitterness that isn't unpleasant.  It just is what it is!  If you like hoppy beer,  you'll enjoy this one."
"It doesn't wreck your palate but certainty wakes it up"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It lives up to its name.  This is a great hoppy beer of you like imperial or double IPA's.  The way it hits you is very aggressive, it is true hop lovers dream beer.  The 9.5% ABV is blended well with the malts so although a bitter beer, it finished smooth.  This is one of the strongest hopped beers I have had."
""
"Juicy happy goodness that fits not go down like a 9.5"
"Tasted overwhelmingly old. Served at Zapp's Beer Fest."
""
"Overall 4.25: Excellent beer.  Great hop blending and very flavorful without being overpowering (regardless of its name).  Amazingly light given its ABV, this is a delicious brew for a brief sessioning...aw, heck, just drink all four of them, but make it a Friday night.  Recommended to all IPA fans."
""
""
""
"a bitter bomb, with a great scent"
""
"I wouldn't call it pallet wrecker....more like pallet enhancer."
""
""
""
"This is an aptley named beer!  The nose has saome nice tropical notes to the hops with some spice and pine as well.  On the palate, it  has a nice malty start but transitions quickly to all bittering hops for a long, dry (astringent?) finish.  Nice, but I wouldn't want more than one."
""
"Deep slightly hazy orange amber brew with a sticky foam cap leaving sheets of lace. Pungent oranges, orange peels, marmalade and grapefruit along with a substantial caramelly malt nose. Biting bitterness right away, almost hot-spicy. Grapefruit pith. Oranges. Garlicky onion. Pine resin. The intense bitterness grudgingly yields just an inch to a creamy carmelly malt backbone which must exist in principle to warehouse all this hop intensity. Powerfully hoppy excellence."
""
""
"Overall: 4.75 - I am incredibly impressed with this beer. The hops linger for days, but it's nice. A definite must try for any beer-lover, not just hop heads."
"You literally won't taste anything else the rest of the night so just keep on drinking Palate Wreckers...  So good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, and if you can get it, reach out an try it. Some good stuff"
""
"Fantastic DIPA! Fruity on the nose; nice and hoppy without actually wrecking your palate."

"Not sure why this thing isn't rated higher. Delicious!"
""
"For the record, I love over the top beers, so it's not that. The issue is that the elements are not balanced correctly. It's still a really good beer but there are so many good DIPA on the market these days that it doesn't take much for me to reach for something else."

"Poured 12 oz bottle into willy glass.  A clear light-amber with two fingers of pure while fluffy head that slowly dissipates and leaves nice lacing.  Smells slightly dank and piney, with just a hint of fruit and malt.  Taste is overwhelmingly bitter, but with a slight burnt caramel-like aftertaste that helps offset the bitterness and makes it quickly dissipate.  Hints of pine, resin, floral and citrus hops and nice sweet crystal malt.  Mouth is thinner than I expected but comes across as refreshing and almost dry, but with just a touch of malt body.  Overall, a really nice IIPA, and not at all the """palate wrecker""" that the name would imply."
""
"Appears a clear amber with a persistent fluffy head. Smells strong of bitter hops, citrus, resin and toast. Tastes strong of bitter citrus hops and floral notes. Feels dry with medium-light body, lively carbonation, finishes long, strong and bitter! *EFL"
""
""
""
""
""
"Aaron's recommendation: Treat this like a dessert beer.  The name says it all. It will wreck your palate, and you'll enjoy every second of it."
"Dark golden amber, nice aromas of citrus, some pine and sweet malt.  The taste is extremely hoppy, grapefruit peel, pine, very resiny. Not very complex just a hop powerhouse and bitterness with long bitter finish."
""
"Overall, I found the hoppy bitterness to be right in line with what I wanted from this one.  Very nice """hop bomb""" of sorts with some pleasantries added for sustained enjoyment.  I look forward to procuring this one again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot going on here and yes a little more malty than expected but hops is the star. A bit of a bite but have had others more bitter. Real nice alcohol and piney smell. Creamier feel if allowed to get to room temp. Alcohol is hidden in taste but seems to pop up post swallow. Not much sweetness, it'd be great to see a Palate Wrecker offshoot with some sweetness. Grab this if you can and like strong hops."
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into tulip. Hazy copper liquid with a finger of off-white foam that settles to a ring. Some dots of lacing remain on the glass. Aroma is grapefruit peel, orange juice, mint, dank hops, caramel, and bread. Taste is briefly citrus sweet then all is bitterness. Like a walnut meets grapefruit peel, meets pine needles. Medium body, oily texture, moderate carbonation, long bitter finish."
""
"Very bitter which is great,  but it is one dimensional. There is more to be desired on the back end after the bite."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: medium carbonation, creamy, dry, bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not a big fan of double ipas, but this is certainly making a case for the imperials"
"The is actually a really good DIPA.  Great hop aroma and grapefruit zing that really lingers. Hides the 9% well. There are better and higher IBU options out there and likely at a far better price point. But I am fortunate to have a local that sells singles so I will grab one on occasion and it's never disappointed. Green Flash gets a lot of grief on BA but this is a solid offering."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color.  Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Pine hop nose and flavor is pine hops with a decent amount of caramel/brown sugar.  High ABV is hidden. $4.85 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best beer above 9%, no alcohol aftertaste"
""
""
"Ironically balanced and tasty as hell, but I'm sure that's the point."
""
""
"Grassy, citrusy hop nose with some graham cracker and fresh cut grass. Pours brilliant copper amber under a 2” off-white foam cap. This is a very creamy beer – it enters with a hint of big malt and caramel but then a big grapefruit rind bitterness blended with a little quinine turns the malt around. Medium full body and carbonation. The carbonation is very fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light auburn/dark gold color with thick off white head that reduces with thick lacing, and great clarity; citrus and fresh cut grass notes; malt  balances nicely with bitter grass and Myers lemon flavors, a little alcohol on the exhale-nice; bitter(in a good way) tongue coating with citrus and hop finish; overall a great example of the """west coast""" style, bigger IPA."
""
""
""
"I'm all for a super hoppy dipa, but this beer has all of the hop bitterness and not a lot of the flavor. And the bitterness lingers on the tongue afterms taking a sip, like sucking on a wet bag of hops from the boil."
"It definitely lives up to the name. Stronger malt backbone than you might expect and an overall very flavorful beer. It may hit the spot if you're in the mood for a big beer with intense flavors. I'm liking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Does not wreck your palate, but does turn it every which way but loose. Great example of a high IBU beer that's not harsh. High ABV is undetectable.  Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally found this beer after searching for months after hearing rave reviews.  I'd say it lived up to the hype.  Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You know what your getting with the title. Very hoppy, but the finish is not too harsh. Mild citrus notes."
"Draft pour into tulip glass.  Pale golden color with tints of reddish brown. Nice small head with minimal retention and light lacing.  Excellent hop aroma builds the anticipation for the taste.  Taste did not disappoint.  Very delicious and well-balanced for the high happiness.  This is my kind of beer and an excellent way to end the night.  If you had this first, you wouldn't be able to properly appreciate a lesser beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super hoppy; really strong citrus and pine flavors.  Definitely couldn't have more than two in a sitting, and it has likely wrecked my palate for any subsequent beers, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my kind of beer! Wow, love the bitterness. The only downside is that my throat is dry the next day after drinking it. But for my next homebrew, I hope to make a copy of this one. Cheers"
"Oh man this looks lovely.  Dark orange in color with a nice white head.  Smells of pineapple and grapefruit. Taste has tropical fruit and more grapefruit with some very noticeable bitterness to remind you what you're dealing with here. A hint of booziness.  Feels like the right amount of carbonation. This really does live up to the name.  My taste buds have been assaulted and are currently in the fetal position. This is so good!"
"Punchy, resinis, citrus, piney, bitter Carmel sweetness"
"Overall: Super-bitter DIPA that showcases hops, not much else. Then again, if you order a beer called Palette Wrecker, you get what you asked for."
"O - 4.50 - A very good DIPA, especially for those who have tried it all and are looking for a new thrill and a kick in the mouth. This is definitely a palate wrecker and will leave even the most veteran of IPA drinkers with an awesome punch of bitter hops to the mouth."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this beer very much. It was very fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"upper echelon overall..."
""
"Pours from the tap at Oak & Ore OKC a clear copper with a finger or so of white head. Medium lacing on the glass. The nose is substantial, with lots of grapefruit and resin. There's a nice maltiness at first, with grapefruit and mango, then the piney resin kicks in. Loads of hoppy bitterness. Medium mouth. This is one of the better Green Flash beers. I've liked some of the others, but this seems a notch above."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much all at once. My palate certainly is wrecked but not to keen on it."
""
""
""
""
"This is another Green Flash that must come from 22 or tap. In this case, 22 into tulip. Deep orange color with a very beige, off white (what, eggshell?) head that compacts to half finger and holds. The aroma is big citrus with some resinous stuff in there for good measure. The flavor is just a deep and sustained citrus hit that gets an add on of earthy pine across the palate, with a nice Simcoe bitter hit to round out the pine in the finish. This is a top-shelf DIPA/IIPA, especially when you need sticky hoppy."
""
""
"One of Green Flash's best offerings. It lives up to the name with big bitter hops that leave your mouth dry and refreshed from the bitter hops. Big tropical notes in the aroma and taste. Not overly malty. A nice sweetness from the malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a """hop-head""" and I can't get enough of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA!! Very little to no aroma and thin white head. Great initial taste with a lot of bite that fades to a smooth finish. Very good beer... Will drink again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a good solid beer. Not overwhelming in any way, but just strong on all fronts. If u drink one, good luck switching to another. It would seem all others pale in comparison. Enjoyed it!"
""
"The name is true to the flavor. The hops hit your mouth and takeover. This is one of my favorite strong hoppy beers from Green Flash!"
"Better than average but nothing great.  Easy to drink a few though"
""
""
""
"Loved this ipa! Green flash really knows how to brew a tasty ipa!"
""
"The name is inappropriate since it does not wreck the sense of taste but establishes it own context of strong flavored which dictate what pairs well, as all food and beverage does. Just as a big red wine cannot pair with fish, this brew must be consumed with equally flavorful foods. I selected several cheese, and it was very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hoppy, very caramelized. No strong aroma."
""
"To bitter for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer. Though it proclaims itself a """palate wrecker," it is accessible and not too boozy. A ton of hops but not to the point where the bitterness overcomes you. Copper color, nice lacing around the glass, and a piney essence. Very good. Will get again."
"I prefer the Green Flash Imperial IPA to this one but still a very solid offering by Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
"O - I've had this a few times now but this is the first time I've been able to really sit down with it, very good stuff. Classic Green Flash hop profile, not as complex as their West Coast IPA, but lots of good flavor to be had and a tasty slight malt backbone, drinks good for the ABV too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured an orange/Dark golden color...Very Piney smell, Citrus and hops. Taste is extremely hoppy, piney and Citrus.  Taste is very strong on these flavors on first sip. The more you drink, the better the hop taste gets unlike other very hoppy beers."
""
""
""
"that’s comparable to my clone, it is not WISE..."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden/orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, pine, citrus. Taste is very aggressive hops, citrus, some pine sand resin, a touch of alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a good beer, and I like my hops, but this one was just a bit over the top for me. Consider my palate wrecked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really hoppy initial taste with a bite to it. It kind of tastes like Lagunitas sucks mixed with stone ipa. Pretty bitter. not bad"
""
"A little too much for the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell of alcohol. Taste of sweet grapefruit, cantaloupe and alcohol. Powerful bitterness."
"Very hoppy nice taste beginning to end"

"OVERALL: Good stuff. The malty backbone gives it a higher FG than some of the other examples of the style, but I enjoy that, which is obviously a matter of personal taste. I don’t remember this brew being so soapy either, so since the recipe probably hasn’t changed, I guess my palate has done a bit of re-schooling. Can imagine this soapy character comes from using citra as a bittering hop, which really isn’t my thing. Still, this is a very well executed brew and has a lot of things I like about certain higher ABV double IPA’s. Well worth checking out especially if you like hopper brews with higher FG’s. Thanks again Frank for bringing this along all those years. It’s made me a curious searcher ever since. Cheers!"

"An aptly named beer, don't go pulling anything special from the cellar to follow this bad boy. Pours an opaque orange amber color with a thin white head, full bodied beer that leaves a sticky mouthfeel. On the nose there is pine and citrus fruit like orange and lemon, and sweet malts. There is a big hop bitterness here but also a nice balance to it, nice flavors of grapefruit, lemon, tangerine. One of the better imperial IPAs I've had."

"Lite ruby in color. Very clear, no particles. Strong hoppy smell. Earthy aroma. Very bitter. I know you can only taste bitterness to 80 IBUs, but this just seems so much more bitter than others I've had in that range. Earthy flavor. Hops also come through. Hops and bitterness are noticed throughout you’re mouth. I like it. This really will wreck your palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"They aren't kidding here. Seriously hopped up. Still there was nice body besides just the hops, and amazingly strong floral aroma. quite carbonated, very crisp. Almost makes your tongue numb."

"Overall: You know right by my house there's this little mom and pop shop which has a crazy good selection of beers and the owner highly recommended this to me, Jesus the guy must know what I really love. It's bitter complex and offers everything that beyond meets the expectations of a DIPA. I would rate it a notch higher but has slight room for improvement. Maybe with proper aging it can. Salud!"

"Pours a nice finger head p.  A dark amber orange color.  Smells of a very robust hop combination with definite piney citrus smell and taste.  A definite bite of alcohol and hoppy goodness.  Finishes with a warm feel that lingers in back of throat.  Definitely not for the faint of heart.  A pretty smooth mid mouth feel.  Pretty accurately named.  I love this company more every time I try."

"Overall: This is the most appropriately named beer I've had in recent memory. I'm a hop head and find this to be a big beer. Very bold and intense flavors. Really does challenge the palate. In fact, i think the initial taste was borderline overwhelming. However, the finish and aftertaste is so vibrantly citrus which is my favorite aspect of this beer. I love a beer I can still taste on the ride home and even once I get home. I don't say this often, but one of these bad boys is definitely enough. This isn't one of my favorites in the style, but it is quite an experience, and id recommend it to any hop head. Cheers!"

"Had on draft at the brewery earlier this year, and found in bottle locally. If youre a fan of hops, this is your beer. It is on the pricier side, but well worth it. It is a beer to drink slowly and enjoy. For my first BA rating/review, what better beer to give such high marks. Amazing aroma and a delicious bite! Fantastic!"

"Good God, this is intense stuff! This beer is characterized by big hop and malt flavor, super boozy. Nice citrusy flavors from start to finish. Awesome copper color, beautiful beer. Significant amount of head with thick lacing. Never disappointed by Green Flash."

"Good beer. Like the hoppiness and smooth drinkable nature of the beer. Definitely a spot on west coast ipa. Color is nice, smell is great! The hops scent is perfect! Nice bitterness when it hits the palate by not overbearing at all. Defnielty a great example of what a west coast ipa should taste like."
""
"Overall: This would be a good spicy food beer. Drink with something that can hold up to the hops. Spicy Thai food, hot wings, Mexican, or Creole. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite. As far as San Diego area beers go I still prefer Stone."
"Overall - The brew is oh so true to the name (hallelujah) and true to the style. Strong bitterness that sticks to the palate throughout the sip. Hopheads will be happy with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This one surprised me! For having such a high ABV it is quite smooth and I could easily get lost in one after another of these bad boys. I've only had it on draft but plan on getting it in the bottle, if i can find it. Can't stop thinking about you, oh great wrecker of palates!"
""
"Overall: Not quite as good as I thought it was going to be from the buzz, but still a very good IIPA. At 9.5%, it's as easy of a drinker as you'll find, too."

"When I consider the term 'Palate Wrecker', a few items come to mind - one, so bitterly hoppy that your tastebuds suddenly decide to take a few days off, and two, the effect renders all others around it unworthy of the memory of the beer in play here, i.e. don't pour me another brew - I just had my palate wrecked! I don't believe that this actually falls into either category - it's just another well-made, stupidly drinkable, hedonistic example of the upper echelon of malt and hop interplay. There, I said it. Now Imma gonna go have another beer, my palate actually the one encouraging me as such."
"One of these is just about right, as the name implies, more than that would wear on me I think. Clearly a lot going on here, but balanced enough that it's enjoyable."

"Overall: a pretty decent American IPA - different to the norm per the Green Flash style. Also per the Green Flash style however, the price is a bit too steep at AU$175 for a case of 24 x 355mL - it ain't that good. Not worth it. Perhaps for one every now and then at a tasting."

" O - Palate Wrecker is definitely a beer for someone who wants a aggressive hop bomb because it definitely delivers in these two areas. Not for someone just getting into craft beer it will be to much bitterness/hopyness for them. If you like really aggressive hop bombs this one is for you, Cheers!"
""
""
"O: great double IPA. Strong, hoppy, and tasty. Well balanced for a big beer."
""
"Well, it is aptly named. Plenty of piney hops with a strong sweet backbone that pulls back to leave a spicy, bitter bite. A strong sipper, here."

"Second time having this, but the first time was pre-reviewing. Pour is a beautiful translucent amber with nice white foam and beautiful sticky lacing. Taking a whiff gets you a noseful of piney, floral, hoppy goodness. And the flavor is like everything good about hops just exploded in your mouth. So delightful. And super easy drinking; at 9.5% I got buzzed in a hurry. I love this beer."

"O – Had this from the bottle prior to this, can't believe I found it on tap. What a great beer this is, supreme balance."

"The Pallet Wrecker is a big IPA...very bitter. The beer poured a cloudy golden with white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent is very bitter with hints of citrus. The taste is starts and finishes very bitter. There is alot of grapefruit zeal present. The mouthfeel is full bodies with good carbonation. Overall this is a big sipping beer. This would be a fav or bitter heads."

"Bottle poured into a snifter in several increments. A reddish golden bronze color sporting a nice creamy beige head, I am indeed preparing for a palate-wrecking experience. Skimmed a couple of reviews below and cannot resist mentioning ... To the guy who was confused, the mash is sparged with a further dose of hopped wart, as opposed to the more typical water. The basis for the beer is a hopped wort, further purged of fermentables by yet more hopped wort. In any event, the aroma here is perfumy sweet, floral and herbal yet with a subtle butterscotch vibe, citrus, vinous fruit like white wine, and some dry white pepper. Green Flash manages to coax some complex multifaceted hop flavors out of its IPAs and this is no exception. The initial tastes are on the light side, some candied ginger, sweet tropical mango and lychee, something decidedly floral ... Honeysuckle? These elements give way to some grapefruit and blood orange citrus, green tea ... The bitterness ain't wrecking my palate initially, although now there's some interesting burnt mint and leather flavors revealing themselves. Soapy, slick mouthfeel with a few bubbles but not too fizzy. And BOOM, there's the bitter: Juniper and menthol, celery stalk and black pepper. About halfway through the bottle, a rank, powerfully resinous bitterness assails the mouth, like oolong tea steeped with pine needles. Some dried apricot appears in the otherwise pungent finish. Quite thick and syrupy but this does little to reign in the hoppy assault. While I have had more bitter DIPAs, at least in terms of raw power, this one steals the show when it comes to balancing aggression with nuance. Had to track it down in BC rather than Alberta."

"An excellent DIPA- very West Coast. One of my favorite breweries from this region."
""
""
"Overall: Above average. The citrus hop notes are really not complex at all, but the sheer presence of hop oils hits the tongue hard, and I like that. There is a faint malt back that is intriguing. Overall, one of the better DIPA's that I have had recently, up against Victory DirtWolf and Flying Dog Double Dog, all of which I have tried for the first time yesterday and today."

"Poured out a clear deep amber with a big creamy white head. There is great retention and nice sticky lacing. The aroma is big citrus hops, with distinct grapefruit notes, and hints of caramel malt in the background. The taste is also big hops, but splendidly balanced against the malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than the taste and aroma indicated but it's not at all thin or watery. A great big DIPA."

""

"The best beer I've tried from Green Flash. Pours a standard amber and has an incredible smell with sweet and hoppy notes. To my surprise and delight, not overpowering at all as its moniker implies. Hoppy, not too heavy, with a strong, direct flavor. Nice aftertaste. One of the best IPAs I've had."

"If you like hops, you must try it. If you like malt, God bless, crack one open, take a sip, and pass it on to your hop head friends"

"Overall, I can't say I largely enjoy drinking this beer. But I certainly appreciate the work involved in creating it, and the interplay of some imposing elements. A worthwhile experience."
"O - I was a little skeptical of this at first. I love fresh Green Flash, but I've been burnt in the past with the IPA being outdated (my own fault I know), but this beer is just awesome. Fresh is the biggest adjective. It tastes like this was just brewed and then bottled this morning."

""
""

"Overall: The is a fantastically bitter double IPA. While the hoppy bitterness is huge, the malt does a very good job pulling back on their reins. I can only imagine how much more intense this would be if the malt profile was smaller. Great job Green Flash!"

"O- This was juicier than expected, and less palate wrecking than expected."
""
""
""
"Overall: A confusing beer. Enjoyable to drink, way more enjoyable to smell, but in the end it left me wondering why they added so much malt to balance out a beer that is advertised as a """palate wrecker""". I'm glad I tried it but at this price I likely won't have it again. Still very tasty, just didn't live up to its full potential as I see it."
"O: Boy oh boy, this is everything I had hoped it would be; however, it was EXTREMELY hard to score, for me. Because even though everything about it stopped me in my tracks by how perfect I believe it to be, I can't rate it perfect overall for the sole fact that this brew is so ass-kicking that I literally could not indulge in it often. With that being said, this has creeped into my favorites and will be revisited for sure as a once-in-a-blue-moon treat."

"O - Palate Wrecker is exactly what it calls itself, don't plan in enjoying any other beers after you have this one. I'd recommend it being the last beer of the night. I enjoyed it but I enjoy big bitter hopbombs. This might have been a bit too much in terms of the backend bitterness for me but to each his own. Great DIPA."
""
""
"BBD 6/27/14. Pours a clear medium amber with a nice dark ruby hue. Average head and lacing. Rich nose of grapefruit, with hints of other sweet citrus, over a light background of pine and caramel malt. Medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is on the low end of normal. The complex flavor profile is a hop assault over a nice caramel balance. Grapefruit begins the assault with notes of other citrus. It then progresses to pine coupled with a nice intense bitterness that is pine and grapefruit rind. Towards the end, a well balanced caramel sweetness emerges to somewhat soothe the palate. The finish is an alcohol burn at the back of the throat with lingering bitterness and tartness. This one is not for the faint hearted."
""
""
""
""
"I recommend this beer to anyone that gets a kick out of really hoppy beers, but note: unlike some DIPAs I've had it isn't hopped just for the sake of hops, the bouquet and different hops really bring out a great flavor that goes past the assaulting bitterness. The company says it is made with hopped wort... but all IPAs are made with hopped wort so I'm not sure why they advertised that in this particular beer? Also the 12 oz was under half the price of the 22 oz, so not sure what the incentive would be to buy the 22 oz... (maybe they weren't expecting the liquor store to sell the 12s as singles). And at 9.5% one of these just left me in a nice fuzzy place."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Few DIPAs have made an impression on me like this one has. As I sip it, my palate not only adjusts to the unbridled bitterness, but begins to crave it. For true connoisseurs of IPAs, this is not a palate wrecker, but a palate placebo. Bathe in the bitterness, my friends."

"O - This is an excellent beer that I am very happy to have picked up on a whim. I've had their West Coast IPA before; this seemed less bitter, but I didn't realize until after I bought it that it's also an old bottle (1/8/13). However, that didn't seem to matter, as the hops don't seem to have faded but rather melded nicely with the rest of the beer. I'd like to try this fresh as well for comparison. Definitely worth a try, and I'll be getting this again."
""
"Easily drinkable for a DIPA fanatic like myself, all others beware, this is not a beer to be trifled with if you don't know what to expect let alone if you don't like other DIPAs. This beer is just insane and it's so good. Great brew from GreenFlash."

"O - Palate Wrecker is a worthy bottling and has some real brilliance to it. I don't favor it as much as the other Green Flash double ipa's, but its still something ill buy every year. This is just another great offering from G Flash. It has equal quality and class to their other double ipa's, but still remains different in character. This is more traditional ipa turned up a few notches. Very enjoyable and well worth the experience over and over again."

"O - Add this to the growing list of beers from Green Flash that I love. Palate Wrecker is everything I'd want it to be: huge citrus hoppiness, subtle malts, massive abv, and yet incredibly drinkable. Will continue to buy this often."
"A very good iipa. Very balanced and bold. Tons of piny and citrus notes from the hops. With just the right amount of malt sweetness to balance the beer and give it complexity. Silky, creamy mouthfeel. A very good interpretation of the style. Very Impressive"

"Wow this is a nice beer. Hints of honey and lots of hops. Similar to hopslam but I might actually like this better. Too bad its $15.99 for a 4-pack near me. definitely worth it for a treat once in awhile. If you have not tried this I definitely recommend it."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and decent example of the style, it had a lot of those west coast IPA aspect but the green onion seemed to get a little out of hand in this one and I thought it started to clash with the other flavors. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, slightly crisp, a little sticky, not too filing and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, i don't have the urge to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a very nice looking beer, it had good color, head and lacing. What I liked the least about this beer was the heavy green onion/garlic aspect, it just doesn't blend well with the other hoppy aspects. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not hard to find a DIPA that I like more for a better price. I would recommend this as a good DIPA unless you really like the onion/garlic aspect. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, I've heard that many people enjoy this beer, but I can't say that was the case for me, those onion/garlic hops really held this beer back from being as good as it could be. This isn't my favorite DIPA and it didn't make for the best first impression for Green Flash, better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A balanced west coast style IIPA. Hop bitterness up front that is mellowed out by the malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good brew, but I'm glad I picked up a single rather than a full 4 pack. This is something I could probably drink one bottle a year of, but it is a very good and well executed brew. Not sure I would exactly say it wrecks your palate, but it is packed full of hops."

"I admire how well built this brew is. I acknowledge its complexity. I see the parallels to Stone's Bastard line. But to my (un-wrecked?) palate, the primary flavor here is a rank one, and this rankness is neither inherently interesting nor pleasantly counterbalanced by creamy or sweet notes. It is the liquid equivalent of that guy we all know--the abrasive, intelligent jerk who thinks his intelligence justifies his abrasiveness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is """biggie small""". There's elements of hugeness that are tempered with restraint."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good DIPA, but nothing special and the drinkability suffers a bit from the malt sweetness."
"Overall, a very good DIPA. Pretty big hops presence for the hop heads, while there is a bit of malt to balance it out for those not as fond of the hops."
""
""
"O: A great one-off DIPA. One that I wouldn't drink many of, and it is important to remember to drink this after you have any other beers you might be interested in savoring, because it truly lives up to its name!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I am becoming more of a fan of IPA's and able to appreciate the style. Palate Wrecker Hamilton's ale Is a good imperial IPA from green flash brewery in San Diego , CA that is not as piney or floral as some. 9,9% AVB. Nicely balanced sweet malty up front with the bitter finish"

"O- Green Flash is killing the IPA game. They know what they are doing out there in San Diego. Bravo!"

"O- A quality beer from a quality brewer. A hop forward IPA with attitude. Hop heads rejoice!"

""

"Overall this beer is nothing great..just your typical double."

""
""
""
"O: I've never tried this fresh, but I'm pretty satisfied with it for being nearly a year old. Some IPA's will develop into interesting """mini-barleywines""" if cellared, though most will just kind of fade into nothing interesting. I think this one does a lot better than most. I might actually keep one of the four-pack for another year just to see."

"I wonder if this beverage was named at Hamilton's Tavern, during their 2nd Anniversary shindig, and if the individual(s) decided to call this """Palate Wrecker""" actually based on their """wrecked""" palates or ??? Nonetheless, the name is spot-on...my palate is truly wrecked, but in a good way! The hoppy bitterness is nearly overwhelming to the point that if the alcohol didn't numb that part of the brain, this stuff would be intolerable, for the uninitiated that is! For the true hop-head, this beverage is a must try...Two or three times!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The first IPA that I've had from Green Flash that I really loved. No doubt a big bitter IPA, but plenty of fruity hops are picked up to make it more then a bitter bomb. Aromatically wonderful, I could live inside my glass."
""
"Final Thoughts: So glad Green Flash is distributing to MN now, real world-class brewery in my opinion. These masters of hops definitely made a great beer in Palate Wrecker. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"Like your hoppy pales big and bitter? You will love this one. For me it lacks some of the finer flavors more late hop additions might have added to balance, and isn't as fine as I like."
""
"Too much? Yes! but well done, and interesting. Yes! I am nursing with some chocolates and late night reading."
"Overall- Solid beer for me but I understand the love. This beer is not bullshit- this is one of the most devastatingly hopped beers I've ever had. I used to like that but now, a beer like this is a chore. It is alcoholic enough to make me briefly forget all that though. Worth a try but it is pretty much what it says it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"West Coast definitely jarred something loose with this one."
""
""
"The ONLY reason I won't give this one a higher rating is because as great as it is, the bitterness would probably stop me from drinking a lot of this before the ABV caught up to me. Regardless, legendary brew."
"It's a huge hop bomb that does what the name implies. I think I need to lie down now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well made beer that hides its alcohol quite well. Unlike a fruity West Coast style of DIPA, this plays on those green and pine hop flavors. Even if it's not one's preference, this is a great beer to have around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a cream colored head.I can smell the hops 2 feet away - pine needles and lemon zest. Amazingly smooth; a pleasant hops bitterness settles in on the palate after a while, but there is also a distinctive grapefruit tartness - outstanding. Hardly any hint of the alcohol; surprising considering the high ABV. Leaves the mouth dry and wanting more. The name kept me from trying this one before as I'm not usually a fan of extreme hops. I'm glad I tried it because, even though it may be quite hopped up, it is exceptionally well-crafted and blended."
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful! Everything you expected from a beer name Palate Wrecker."
"O: Even though I love hoppy beers, the beer's name does hold true, the hops are almost a bit too much for my palate. Take that as a bit of a warning but overall it's still a solid well-made beer"
""
"Damn this is good! Pours a deep red copper color with a long lasting Off white head. The aroma is pure hoppy bitterness. Fresh and clean. Pine, citrus, and grass. It sips clean and refreshing. Coats the mouth just right with a beautiful hop resin that lasts well longer than this ale will. The flavor explodes in the mouth with a burst of fresh bitter hops. All the aroma notes shine through. This is an awesome imperial ipa for those hop heads outthere. May even blow hop slam out of the water."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly hoppy beer from Green Flash, but what do you expect from these guys? Manages to stay drinkable, despite the barrage of flavors."

"O- Despite the disparagement with ABV, Palate Wrecker is overtly reminiscent of Stone's Ruination IPA than anything else. If you have a penchant for bitter brews...this might be your weapon of choice. For the price, however, I will take Stone's Ruination without a thought. This is my 4th Green Flash brew and although I enjoy Palate Wrecker, I will prefer their Green Bullet, as it is much more unique. If/When Green Flash' satellite brewery in Virginia Beach, VA launches, I hope that brews like Palate Wrecker will be more affordable in the East Coast....until then, I will take Stone's Ruination IPA. (4Pack - $13.59)"
"O: This is a fun beer to drink. There is so much going on that it's hard to wrap your head around it. It does not feel like 9.5% ABV, more like 7.5% or so. Takes awhile for your palate to get use to this beer. Wonderfully refreshing and complex all at the same time. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"UPDATE 3/4/14: Found a fourpack for $14 in Connecticut, so $3.50@ is a little better. Having the first bottle from that now, (Best By 6/27/14) and it generally confirms my earlier review, except I'm not getting as much of my beloved caramel malt aroma or flavor as reported before, and not as much as in the Shipyard XXXX I had last night. Also reducing the rating on mouthfeel from 4.5-4. But it's still so good, I'm surprised it's almost gone already. With luck and the creek don't rise, this will be a favorite top-hoppy seasonal of yours truly for years to come."
""
""
""
"O-At the end of the day it is too harsh and not balanced enough. Yes it packs a hop bunch but the balance isn't there."
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent Imperial IPA, one of my favorites from the San Diego area."
"Overall: A very good imperial West Coast style IPA. Lives up to its name with a very bitter and juicy mix of hop flavors."

"Pretty dank, but this is one that probably shouldn't be bottled. I've had it in that format a few times, and never felt it lived up to the name, and this is no exception. Resinous, malt sugars, moderate bitterness. The bottles are just not really notable, even buying them from a cooler at a bottle shop with high turn-over, like I did with the bomber from The Bier Stein in Eugene."
""
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Leaves a sticky sweet feeling in the mouth after each sip. Resinous with a dry finish. The alcohol is well disguised for a 9.50 % abv beer. Well worth trying if you get the chance."
""
"O: A challenging beer even for the avid hop head. I enjoyed it, but taking down more than one pint truly wrecks your ability to taste anything else."
""
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Palate Wrecker is an apt name. While not as flavorful as their standard West Coast IPA, this is definitely the personification of bitter."
""
""
"O Palate Wrecker! No shit palate wrecker. I give it to GF for aiming to do something and following through. The booze and the bitterness define this brew. Both are prominent and unrelenting. It's good but, damn, it is bordering on too much. If such a thing exists."
""
"O - There's hoppy beers, then there's Palate Wrecker. Upon smelling the beer I immediately considered my palate destroyed but Green Flash balances this tropical hop bomb with so much sweet malt that the smooth body and bitter finish even out for a wonderfully drinkable experience!"
""
"Would maybe have again: a must for in-your-face-IPA lovers."
""
"very dark orange color. fluffy head. smells of grapefruit. very bitter on the palate. nice thick coating around the sides where the level was. beautiful brew to look at and pour. some decent carbonation. bitter indeed. this is what 149 IBUs is? I wonder what a lemon or a grapefruit is? nice color. nice pour. nice to look at. more bitter than I want to taste, but it's a great brew and they did a great job with this one. borderline novelty brew unless they're really producing and selling mass quantities of this. I suppose as a seasonal they probably do pretty well, though...."
"Overall: An excellent DIPA, however, the it doesn't seem as memorable to me as other hoppy brews that Green Flash has put out. Still, the hop flavors are deeper than most beers- especially West Coast brews where, all too often, the brewers seem to just say """screw it, let's throw a bunch of hops in this and it will be good.""" This has a lot of hops, but it's well done."
""
"I'm not sure why my palate perceived this in such a fashion but Damn I like it."
"Green flash hasn't made a single beer yet that I haven't really liked. This one is no exception."

"O - Very tasty beer. Definetly recommended for the hop heads."
""
""
""
""

"O-this was a DIPA very unique it's a must try for hop heads"
""
"'Palate Wrecker' is a misleading name for a beer that is so smooth and approachable (for hopheads, anyhow). Green Flash is a brewery that typically caters exclusively to craft beer drinkers - their products aren't for the mass market and this one is no exception. Those that like lupulin will find few better, more flavorful examples of this earthy, herbal, tropical style."

"Been waiting to try this one ever since Green Flash came to the area. It is good, maybe not as good as I was hoping, but that is probably mostly due to my build um in my mind. Glad I got a 4 pack but due to the price I will probably only pick this one up every once in a great while."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Plenty of effervescence, giant head, and some very spotty yet persistent lacing. Very piney and floral with lemon citrus. Has a slight nutty base character with an extremely hoppy bitter palate. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"Palate Wrecker may not be big on providing a wide array of scents and flavors, but it does not need it. If you want a DIPA that is going to just absolutely kick you in the mouth and make you say """yes sir, I'd like some more", then Palate Wrecker is probably the beer to find and consume. At your own risk."
""
""
"O: It lives up to its name. Not something I would drink on a regular basis but a one and done kind of beer. Very tasty and packed full of hop goodness."
""
""

"Aroma: Strong herbs, pines, hops, metallic caramel. Appearance: Crimson gold with no foam. Taste: Strong bitter hops, cinnamon, caramel, chalky molasses, brown sugar and faint grapefruit. Overall, I remember this being much better. Doesn't taste fresh and juicy Imperial IPA. Still it's really good. Strong bitterness and pronounced alcohol. I'd give this a B rating."

"Pours out an amber/dark orange/maroon in color with a finger white head with little retention and a little lacing. Smell is fruity with a little pineapple, orange, and a little a little mango. There is seems to be a little sweet malt in the background that gives the beer a tiny bit of balance in the nose but it's hop forward to be sure. Taste is definitely a little more malty in the mouth with a little leather and sweetness but the hops are the spotlight with the fruit smelled in the nose but more bittering hops as it's drank and slides down the throat. To be clear there is a little bitterness in the mouth but it really is more so in the throat. Mouthfeel is fairly thin to a tad thicker which is great for the style. Overall this is a nice example of this type of beer. I really like it."

"A kick of big fat hops right upfront, pithy and resiny. Tons of citrus and pine, all at once flavorful and sticky and bitter. Flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, pine and orange rind. Bitterness lingers and hangs in the sides of the cheeks. Subtle malt rides beneath acting as a balance to the hops, but rides far beneath. Mouthfeel is a tad slick, but warm and tingly from the ABV. Carbonation tickle helps the hops pop. Great beer, a hophead's delight for those that like 'em bitter."

"O- This is the most bitter beer I've had next to super fresh Oracle. But with Oracle there was some more malt in there. I enjoyed most of drinking this beer but the aftertaste and stronger lingering bitterness was a bit too much for me. I would love to prank a few non-hop head beer buddies with a glass of this stuff."

"Standing tall , strong, and above peers like Stone Ruination, Green Flash West Coast IPA, any of the Oregon contenders, etc. This *is* the definitive west coast USA IPA. It reeks of scent, flavor, mouth-feel, and anything else you might want. It has grapefruit notes out-the-arse, and it does indeed, 'wreck' you palate. But that's only an issue if you want to eat during, not after. Chase this with a slice of pizza, a filet mignon, or ceviche- it doesn't matter. Your palate- true to word- will be cleansed, save for a slightly lingering citrus note. They should--- for diet conscious customers--- put out nutrition info, this must be ~250-300 cal/bottle, if that matters to you. With that said, enjoy. And drive safely home (aka taxi)"

"I love this stuff. It is a super, super hoppy, bitter DIPA. I love the smell and the taste thoroughly. The aftertaste does leave a bit to be desired though since the bitterness lingers a bit too much. But the high ABV and smell / taste outweigh the aftertaste for me. You can really only have one or two at a sitting but I highly recommend!"

"From my tasting notes: The beautiful deep amber brew gave off a gorgeous aroma of sweet grapefruit and floral hops and was a wonderful smelling IPA. The taste was aggressively hoppy with a great blend of citrus, dank and piney hop flavors to make it a perfect Hop Bomb. While it covered my palate with a hoppy resinous residue it was surprisingly drinkable and an enormously enjoyable Double IPA. In short, I loved this beer."

"This is one of those DIPAs that are like high-octane tropical fruit juice. While considerably more drinkable than some of that leaning (Hop Juice, I’m looking at you), this isn’t entirely my cup of tea. My first beer from Green Flash that didn’t completely wow me."

"Overall, about the best double IPA I've tried. Would be interesting to stand it up against one a month old to see if, when fresh, the hops overpower all. Definitely recommended, and certainly stands up well alongside it's slightly weaker brother, West Coast IPA."

"Poured into becker pint glass; clear golden amber with a fluffy white head that leads tons of lacing. Smell is big on piney and dank hops, with a nice malt backbone. Taste starts out with very bitter piney hops right off the bat, with some sweeter fruity hops following, more subdued. It gets more drinkable after each sip, and the caramel malt is more noticeable as it warms. Hop-heads will love this; others may find it too bitter. A great in-your-face DIPA; don't be expecting something called """Palate Wrecker""" to be subtle."

"O - The beer is aptly named, as the intensity of the hops overwhelms everything else. If the point of this beer is to see just how unbalanced a beer can be, then mission accomplished. I've tasted several well-balanced, surprising delicious Imperial / Double IPAs recently that let the malts share the stage with a hop extravaganza, proving that a big beer can be both hop-forward and balanced, which is what made them quality beers. This beer is the opposite of that concept. It's going to be a while before my tongue forgives me. To sum this beer up in one word (other than the obvious """bitter"""): obnoxious."
""
"I am generally not a fan of the HUGE in your face IPA but this is probably the most balanced """BIG""" beer on the market. You can actually taste the malts, and enjoy the hoppy bitterness. Isn't an alcohol bomb either, nice and smooth for a beer nearing 10% ABV. I will be having this one again!"

"Beautiful Golden coppery murky Beer with a nice head. I have found myself going back to this one since I discovered it a few months ago. Super duper charged DPIA. This beer is a new fav for me. Extraordinarily bold. Definitely one you will remember. It is bitter, and I adore it."
"Great beer. Poured a dark copper orange into a 16 ounce pint style glass. The smell was not overly distinctive but you could smell some of the hops. The taste was very strong complex hop flavors. Left good lacing on the glass. There was not any lingering after taste. Had four on tap and subsequently bought two in bottles. The bottles paled by comparison but the draft was a top quality IPA. Stumbled on this beer when my local favorite beer place switched out the WEST Coast IPA with this one day. Discovered the ABV after the fourth beer."

"Palate Wrecker certainly lives up to its namesake! Let's start with the color - it's a murky, yet sediment-free burnt orange, with a billowy cap of white suds. It looks rich and full of flavor... almost overflowing with it. The aroma is very bright and bursting with fruit esters - kiwi, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, and a little dash of brown sugar. Getting to the actual flavor - it's got a good amount of malt sweetness that I did not expect, and the hop aspects start off with that grapefruit juiciness, then it evolves to"""resinous," to a final super piny, drying bitterness. I welcome the harshness of the finish. It's amazing how one beverage goes from juicyfruit to such a sharp dryness. I love it. It's a heavy beer too, beware. I will absolutely be buying this masterpiece again!"

"Taste starts with hop resin, moves on to pine, ends with piney, grapefruit and orange. Has a sticky, resiny, piney, slightly caramel malty finish. Mouthfeel is just less than heavy with moderate carbonation, a little creamy/bready. I love this beer, the great hop flavors along with just the right (but very small) amount of malt. Also, some hops bombs have an oppressive aftertaste, this one does not at all."
"Not a big fan, but I can understand how a true over the top hop head would be. To me, this beer doesn't even compare to Green Flash's excellent West Coast IPA, which shows a good balance of malt and hops."
""
""
""
""
"Sticky resin dominates the smell along with light citrus. However the taste, while quality, is not my favorite. Stacks of bitterness dominate without all the ancillary hop flavors that I know and love. This tastes like what happens when I cook and reduce an IPA too much for the rest of the recipe. Bitterness is great, but not when it is standing alone. I suppose it is living up to its name of wrecking palates, and I can appreciate that, but I want more. More citrusy grapefruit, more malt backbone, or more sticky resin, this is a good beer but needs another dimension to become a great one."

"Overall, a monster hop bomb. Tons of bitterness, but not a lot of good hop flavors."

"This is one of my favorite DIPAs ever. Super hoppy and also very multi-faceted. I will say it will probably put off anyone who isn't into hops, it's pretty intense. Still one of the best. Green Flash rocks."
""
""
""
""
"O: As the name would indicate, this is a seriously hop heavy beer and slightly out of balance (tons of bitterness compared with just a light hint of sweetness). This is not the easiest of beers to drink both from the hop intensity and the not so hidden alcohol. Not sure I would have another of these but glad to have tried it."
"Overall not that I regret picking up a whole six pack for 10 bucks this is one drinkable old DIPA. Not notable alcohol taste and great balance of hops to malt make for a very drink able brew."

"Overall this is a tasty beer for serious hop heads only. Great hop profile that nails the double IPA category."

"The relatively crazy hop IBUs definitely make their presence known, and as long as you know what you're getting yourself into, then this IIPA should make your day.

"Overall: Hopheads would love it, maltists would scoff at it and lagerboys will run hysterically from it. Green Flash Palate Wrecker is a unique beer with plenty of character and much to offer the hop connoisseur. This is indeed an intense double IPA, and chances are you'd either fall head over heels for it or dismiss it as another overhopped generic American IPA. Regardless, my palate has been wrecked."

"O: One of my favorite IPAs of recent memory – and that’s not just because I’ve wiped out my recent memory with beer. Green Flash has bottled pure hop essence in a container that can barely hold it, as I found out with just a single whiff. I can honestly say that this is one of the hoppiest beers I’ve ever had, which is a distinction I don’t take lightly. I think the last time I awarded that was for Stone’s Ruination…and this is even hoppier. If this were available without a huge drive, I’d be drinking this All. The. Time."

"I poured this one into a glass. It has a amber color body with a 2' finger of white head. The smell has a carmel note, with a great blast of citrus hops. The taste has a great hop bit up front then a little malt on the back of the tongue. i love the bite from the hops it hits your tongue like a rocket. The moutfeel is great, leaves a nice little after taste on the tongue. Over all this is a great DIPA"

"O: This was solid, but the amount of bitterness from the hops was quite high without having much in the way of other flavors the hops should have imparted. I'll probably drink another but I'm not going to run out to grab it."

""
"Overall: This sort of reminded me of what Hopslam used to be prior to 2013, albeit far more hop-forward. Hop haters need not apply, as this will just end up being a drainpour. The bitterness is extremely assertive and may even be too much for even seasoned hopheads. It is not quite as bitter as Sixpoint Resin or Stone Ruination, but it is extremely close. Seek this out as it really is a great beer, but brace yourself. 17/20"
""
"O: pretty distinctive green flash hop profile kicked up a notch. interesting, but not as enjoyable as the imperial ipa. a little too in your face. palate wrecker, indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And a palate wrecker it is! Just an in your face DIPA. Lots of bitterness with pine and grapefruit fighting it out. Pine comes strong up front but grapefruit pushes more at the end. It's like talking a bite out of a fresh grapefruit, rind and all. Solid malt base for the extreme use of hops. Not a very complex mix of flavors but if your looking for a hop bomb this is it."
""
""
"O- Pretty solid offering. Wouldn't mind another one bit."
""
""
"O: Let me reiterate: if you don't love hops (and I don't mean those girly hop varieties, like Citra,) you will probably not like this beer. This is a real man's beer. Green Flash pretty much symbolizes west coast IPAs, and this is the best IPA Green Flash makes. My bottle is a few months old, and the hop barrage is completely relentless. I can't even imagine this super-fresh. Anyways, yeah, the DIPA scene is heading toward the more tropical, fruity, hop varieties, but this one is completely old-school and completely awesome. It's a bit one-dimensional in its hoppiness, but it's a hophead's dream."
""
""
"For sure, this was a strong beer and I could feel the booze by the time I finished off the contents of the bottle that I bought. While the alcohol is not detectable via taste, it's present and gives this beer the oomph underneath everything else that went on. This won't certainly wreck anyone's palate but it will give it a good run for its money and push the edge of it out just a bit further, and given that so many hoppy beers are not that discernible from each other, what more could you ask for? Take a good hour and give this is go, there's a lot to like here for anyone who loves hops and depth in a beer."
""
""
""
"Seems sort of like a Sierra Nevada brew ha. Good but probably won't be buying much more of this soon considering Hoptimum, Sucks and Enjoy all by me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks great. smells pretty good, but I don't get much. Maybe it's me. The taste is the real draw, here. It's not called Palate Wrecker for nothing. Bitter, strong hops dominate here. Some citrus, but mostly just a hop bomb, in the best way. Usually DIPAs have a bigger malt presence. Not here. Mouthfeel thick and sticky. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a transparent, deep amber with a one finger off white head. It looked quite nice. Scents of citrus, lemon, and grapefruit. Very appealing aromas. Flavor is almost entirely bitter grapefruit pith, grapefruit rind, a tiny hint of grapefruit and a bit of pine. Very little malt character, very much a hop forward beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with low carbonation. The beer hid it's alcohol content quite well. An excellent hop forward beer, pure citrus and bitterness, probably one of the best west coast DIPAs I've tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great example of a west coast double ipa. Green flash separates themselves from other west coast double ipa's in the fact theirs has so much hop bitterness combined with their roasted malts. It's a unique flavor that hasn't been replicated which makes it remember able."
"Clear amber pour, with a small white head that left some splashes of lace on the glass. As would be expected, the aroma was dominated by hops, citrus pith and pine resin, with hints of a caramel malt backbone bringing up the rear. Lots of orange and grapefruit in the taste, resin, pretty intense WC hop bitterness, with a little tropical fruit and malt sweetness to take the edge off, but the hops were clearly in charge. Maybe not as intense as their regular IIPA, though I'd like to try them back to back to test that theory. Medium body, appropriately carbonated. Maybe a little intense for greenhorns, but a good brew for hopheads."

"overall: I'd have to do some side by side tests to compare this with Ruination and Hop Stoopid, but this is equal if not the winner for the hoppiest beer i've tried. It's so bitter, yet so damn tasty and refreshing. Give this to a non hop head and they will give you the """o"" face like they just took a shot of bourbon. I bought the last 4 pack of the year at my local store, I will be buying more next year."

"Pours a cloudy golden color with no head. Smell is of piney resin and a bit of booze. Taste is citrusy with a lot of piney resin and bitterness. The alcohol is covered up really well but still has a nice sting at the end. Mouth is quite smooth and medium bodied. Slightly above average carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall, I love this brew. You usually don't get this type of pine smell or taste in a beer. Usually it's more of a pine needle taste, but in this it's more like the resin from the tree. I was actually expecting this to be way more bitter than it is, but I think they basically reached the point where it's so bitter that it doesn't really seem bitter. This is definitely one of my favorite IPAs. I'm not sure if I like this or the Imperial IPA they make more. I guess this would be more for a hophead, while the Imperial is less bitter but has a lot more in the way of character."
"D: This was a great IPA. The scent and taste were delicious. The body was amazing, but the finish was harsh with all the intense bitterness, so it was not easy to drink. I'd say this beer met its objective. Very nice brew."

"O: Amazing beer. While many will poo poo it as simply upping the IBU's arms race, there are some serious flavors and aromas within this brew. It's not for the weak of palate, but it holds some amazing secrets for those that can look past the brutal bitterness."

"The beer is light golden and clear with a soft white head. The aroma brings a potent dose of hops, light citrus and pine, and alcohol. Upon my first sip I decided this beer is aptly named. Massive hop character does indeed assault the palate. Alcohol presence is rather forward, and steers me clear of a second helping. This is decent, with some nice things happening, but I prefer a more elegant showcase for the hops, instead of being bombarded with an intensely hoppy alcohol bomb. Personal preference perhaps, but I feel this is middle of the road (or a slight step above) for a DIPA today."

"Good IPA? Absolutely. Great IPA? Arguable. When compared with other beers of the same style, the price is a deal breaker. At $14.99 for a pack of 4, it is hard to justify with so many quality IPAs available."
"The aftertaste is not displeasing as the brew is quite hoppy and peppy. I can appreciate the variation from the typical citrus bomb, and cannot knock it for that, but the flavor is not one I prefer to have in the rotation despite the interesting character, and quality ingredients. A couple of my friends really dig PW, and I respect their opinions, but at $14 a 4 pack not likely one I will reach for any time soon with all the choices out there."
""
""
"Poured a cloudy orage with great head and lace on top of a strong piney, citric hop aroma that has little sweetness to it. Taste is more of the as I thoroughly enjoyed the strong citric, piney hop character and it is balanced, which I found odd as for a DIPA that is smooth, relatively speaking, to drink and not a total tastebud killer I find that I can't really pick out any discernable malt presence. Finish is very crisp and strong thanks to carbonation and ABV although not a bleeder. This is a beer I really enjoyed yet one was enough for me."
""
""
"This is beer is for extreme hop-heads only. The maltiness and high gravity of the beer mask some of the extreme bitterness from so many hops in the boil. At 9.5% it is an intense experience. I really enjoy this one, but I like hops more than the average drinker."

"A very solid beer, flush with bitter herbal notes and a long finish. Quite bitter and very distinctive- I'm very glad they bottled this one. Amber in color with a somewhat short head, but that's okay given the abv. It's got that dill/green onion and sour cream thing going on in the nose from the hops- I happen to love those notes, but I know many do not. Really nicely bitter in the mouth, with an almost beefy flavor rife with the herbal and onion notes as well as some pine to give it some backbone. This is no citrus bomb, but if you're into this profile you'll love it. Very firm in the mouth at first, but then with a creamy finish and a long, mouthwatering, lingering bitterness. An all around excellent beer."

"The body was a deep orange shade of amber, and formed a two finger thick head in the tulip glass. The aroma was very piney and spicy and very much in line with the West Coast style. The taste is where the complexity started to show up. There was a mouth puckering, tobacco like bitterness up front which stayed throughout the taste. The initial shock of bitter was followed by some tropical fruits, such as mango and pineapple. The finish was spicy, with notes of ginger and clove. The beer felt very dry and did not show much of the character of the malt. This definitely lived up to its name, as I can't imagine having another beer after this, except if it's another Palate Wrecker."
"O: Awesome west-coast IPA. This is probably Green Flash's answer to Stone's Arrogant Bastard, but it's well executed, and once your tongue adapts to west-coast IPAs, it's an amazing drink."
"Copper orange color slight haze smells of pine citrus and hops tastes as good and just like it smells. Hop bitterness bites the tongue great for hop heads and a nice way to test if your friends are true hop heads. Will be getting my hands on more of this before its all gone for the year"
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is dry and light, slightly sticky. Overall, this is quite nice."
""
""
"Starts of a really nice looking beer, clear amber/ reddish in color with a small white head and above average lacing. The smell is piney citrusy and resiny with floral notes, everything a hop head is looking for. The flavor is strong and very bitter living up to its name, not exactly a hop bomb due to a good malt profile but still waves of bitter hops dominates the flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit rich for me but by no means bad and overall this is a very good beer. I would not session this one, but a good one to sip."
"This was the third time overall having this brew and probably the best since it was the most fresh of the bunch. I wouldn't mind grabbing another fresh one off a single rack, but wouldn't see ever buying a four pack for myself. I understand if your a big hophead you'll love this one, I just tend to like a bit more balance and less bitterness"
""
"Overall - Many IPA's with scary hop names end up being tame and flavorful. The Palate Wrecker is the first one that has an accurate title. It truly is a hop bomb and bitter on the palate."

"Pours a slightly hazy burnt orange body with a small off-white with okay retention. Aromas are typical of the best DIPAs: tropical fruit and floral and citrusy notes, a bit of bubblegum and honeyed sweetness. Smack of bitterness right up front, with a blast of grapefruit and bitter salad greens. A swell of sweetness, marmalade and caramel, on the mid-palate. Finish lingers for days and days on an ultra bitter note of orange zest. Lot of body on this super substantial beer. This is very good and worth the price."
"I could see this beer as still being able to deliver a hop experience after/during smoking 2 or 3 cigars!"

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall not a bad brew but considering the name, its a bit of a let down. I found it to be surprisingly balanced and almost with too much malt character. It is worth a try and something I would enjoy again while fresh."
""
""
"Lives up to its name, & that makes my heart glad. If you're going to brew a IIPA, throw that balance crap out the window: wreck my palate or give me stouts! Excellent beer. I hope this makes it to WI/MN soon!"

"O: I had been reading reviews of this and stopped because I feared getting myself too excited for it. Green Flash is still near the top of my """breweries to visit""" list."
""
""
""
""
""
"But aside from fond memories, this beer kicks ass. I like my DIPA more on the """almost a hoppy barleywine""" end of the spectrum, generally. Majaraja, Unearthly, for example. Palate Wrecker is certainly not that, but there is a solid foundation for the hops to play on, and it works for me."

"9.5% alcohol with a medium body w/o the gross sweetness of a barely wine. Very similar to a Ruination or a Union Jack. A new favorite- If I made beer, which I haven't the time for because of two babies... this is the beer I would try to make. Not sweet, not thick, very hoppy, very good."
""
"O: I think this a good looking beer which definitely lives up to the hype of being a hop bomb. For as bitter as it is, it is actually very drinkable. It was worth trying and I would definitely pick it up again, though I can't say that this is going to become an automatic buy for me."
"Crystal clear light copper color. Good head retention and lots of lace. Aroma is caramel with floral notes. Flavor is slightly boozy, earthy, and piney, kind of like a forest floor (except, of course, the boozy part). Finishes with tons of bitterness. Lives up to it's name, hard to get any flavor nuances after the first few sips. Medium plus body. Low moderate carbonation. Middle of the road to slightly sweet."
"O- Glad this finally made it to my area of NY after asking my local for months now. Well worth the wait and I'll be picking this up often if it sticks around. A very well rounded IIPA. Well done once again GF!"
"Well it just about manages to deliver on expectations. It is strong, powerful and bitter but as easily drinkable. Do not drink other brews for some time after having this. A winner."

"Nice tropical fruit notes. It's more bitter than most dipas. Unfortunately a little too bitter for my palate, but the flavoring hops were delicious."

"This is pretty much a special occasion beer because once you drink it you're done. Every beer you have afterward will taste different than you remember. Even food that you have will be somewhat skewed. It's an exercise in going all out. And there's a certain joy in that, but at the same time it's definitely un-balanced. It has to be. It can't be anything else. It's completely balanced towards the hop resins, for both bitterness and flavor. So how to review it number-wise? I'm not sure. I'm just going to go hedonistically and see what happens. Cheers!"

"Bitterness is what they wanted and bitterness is what they give you. Bitterness is the king here. It's actually not as """palate destroying""" (or """wrecking", I guess) as you might think, but maybe I'm just conditioned to this kind of thing. This reminded me of a less flavorful Ruination. There weren't enough """other""" flavors to go with the heavy bitterness. Just seems like they were being bitter just to be bitter. In that case, I'll just suck on a hop. Not bad, but probably wouldn't seek it out again. Just grab a Ruination or Hoptimum (in season) if you want a hop attack."

"O – This is an awesome DIPA. It’s not very balanced between the malt and the hops, but it’s not meant to be – after all, the name is Palate Wrecker. While it’s not quite blisteringly bitter enough to truly wreck my palate, it comes dangerously and wonderfully close. Especially as I’m getting toward the end of my glass, the bitterness builds and builds with each sip that I take. I’ve been hearing raves about this beer for a while and I’m so glad that I finally got to try it. It’s insanely drinkable for a beer this bitter that clocks in a nearly 10% ABV. On top of all of that, it’s downright delicious. I’m going to be on the lookout for more from Green Flash. They have a winner here."
""
""
"O: A palate wrecker, indeed! A bomber will give you your hop fix for a week, much less the rest of the day. I definitely wouldn't want to drink another beer after this, because I doubt I would taste it it very much as I'd want to. Averagely priced, and definitely worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"The bitterness decimates your palate, as promised, but its assertive in a way that makes you keep coming back for more. Are you in an abusive relationship with the hops? There is help out there! The flavor is intensely bitters, citrus (tangerines again), dried apricot and pine essence, with a dry sticky finish and just enough heft to coat your mouth and leave you eager for another sip. Wreck it!"

"Have had on tap in San Diego and in bottles on the east coast. IMHO, this is the best of its type - super hoppy IPA's. Lots of resin, pine, grapefruit. Some reviews say that it's unbalanced...not enough malts. Well, it's called Palate Wrecker; balance was not the objective. That being said, it is still extremely drinkable if you like the style. While it might not be so """balanced""" in a traditional sense, it is delicious. This is a great beer, though not for everyone."
"I won't get another one of these, appropriately named"
""
"Overall, I thought this was a fantastic DIPA. I can see how some would say it's too bitter but I felt it was still able to deliver on flavor through the excessive bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Numbing, herbal hop flavor and bitterness up front. Sweetish fruity malts settle in quickly, while the herbal hop bitterness crescendos. A hearty, heady mix of resin, pine, tropical fruit, pineapple, and citrus make for quite the hop presence. The bitterness is pretty intense as well, and just seems to keep increasing into the long finish. I feel like there are hop flowers stuck to the roof of my mouth. Warming notes of fruity alcohol also grace the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy, thick feel. Gentle carbonation takes pity on my alpha acid wracked mouth. Palate wrecker? Maybe, but I like it."

"I was introduced to this beer at the Beer Store over on Second Street Pike (Philly Suburb) I was initially a little skeptical because I'm not really in to hoppy beers but this one is so well balanced with equal hops and malt as well as alcohol. Really tasty and fun to drink."
"Taste - Hoppy and not quite as malty as what I typically go for in a beer that is over 9%. That being said the hops are not too overpowering by any means and while at first taste you might be fooled into thinking that this beer has a low drinkability, but I feel like that vanishes shortly after."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A solid DIPA. Worth a try, but odds are I would not seek this one out again. It's a borderline hop bomb in my opinion. Not quite so hoppy that you straight up avoid it, but hoppy enough to make it a one and done. There are a lot of better DIPAs out there, but I can see why this has a following."

""
"If you're a hop-head (and why would you be looking at reviews of this unless you were), I would definitely recommend this. Every shade of hops with a creamy mouthfeel and a surprisingly sizable caramel malt backbone holding it all together. Not cheap (my 4-pack was $15), and the alcohol is a little more prominent than I would have liked, but very good."

"22oz bomber shared with a friend, pours amber-ish with a frothy, off-white head that leaves thick chunky lacing on the glass. Nice tropical nose with mango, pineapple, and a heavy caramel backbone. Tastes are bold with tropical notes of pineapple and mango, grapefruit, caramel, tea leaf, finishes bitter & dry. Mouth-feel is creamy & drying, a bit resiny; alcohol is present and warming. Bitter hops linger. Overall, I really enjoyed finally having this one, and it lived up to expectations! Definitely recommendable."

"O- I admit, I had high expectations for this beer; being from Green Flash, and one of their anniversary beers. I wanted this beer to taste like a hop farmer wet dream. The smell is amazing, best beer I have ever smelled. The crazy amount of fruit in the nose is intoxicating. The flavor, while being able to hold its own, seemed to be the most neglected part of this beer. Amazing legs, crazy awesome scent, mouthfeel for days, and a flavor that leaves you wanting more fruit. The bitterness could be toned back, and with that, the ABV, I think would make this beer much more palatable and much more sensational fruit and pine. While I don't regret buying this, if I was looking for a radical beer full of fruit, I would grab a Green Flash West Coast IPA."
""
"[O] Ok so, Palate Wrecker is a bit of an overstatement. I thought the beer was decent but I was more impressed with the draft version which, in all fairness was a few weeks fresher. The flavor profile is either not for me, or the bottle did not age well, or the beer wasn't very good to begin with. In any case, I would take another shot with this one, but I'll look for a fresher example."

"O: buy it if you find it, the smell alone makes this a fantastic beer, let it warm for the flavors to fully develop"

"Overall: This was made to be intentionally unbalanced, but even still, it is smooth and full bodied, so as to lend to the best possible experience. A lot of people won't like this, and it is honestly not for everybody. But with a name like Palate Wrecker, you should know what you're getting into. Given what they were going for, Green Flash hits the nail on the head. Not one I'd drink more than one of in a sitting, and definitely saving it for the end of the night, but I'll enjoy it again."

"Appearance is a copper with golden edges. The half finger of head yielded some lace, but nothing overly impressive. The nose was distinctly hoppy.

"Poured 12oz into tulip. Pour is pretty clear, orange, two finer head. Smell a lot of melon, hops, floral, tons of citrus, a lot of orange. Taste is very smooth for the ibus. I get a lot of that melon, lavender, citrus, pine resin, a little licorice. Overall very very drinkable, very good and not your run of the mill imperial IPA, it has a unique floral flavor that makes it stand out."
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, extra hoppy, citrus overtones, coats the tongue, and lingers in the nose. Plenty of hops that cover the pine spectrum as well. Also a sweetness that lasts, with plenty of floral notes and a pleasant carbonation. One of the """happiest""" beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"O: This one is good, but not outstanding. It's pretty well balanced even with the heavy bitterness and very drinkable for 9.5%, which could be dangerous. Maybe it's a good thing that I only have one! Not my favorite D/IPA, which is fine since it's not readily available in my area."

"Overall: all bark in the name but quite gentle IMO. Tasty, nicely done."

"This is a great hoppy ipa! The look of the beer is an amber color and its crystal clear with nice white head. The smell is of pine, citrus, grapefruit, and caramel from the malt. The taste is hoppy, sweet caramel, dry, bitter, piney, citrus, and grape fruit. The mouth feel is nice with great carbonation and bitter that goes on forever. I thought this might be too hoppy but it is perfect bitterness for hopheads. It is also well balanced with its nice caramel malt character. Awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can't see too many non-hopheads appreciating this beer; it trends a fine line between a solid IPA and just another hop bomb, but I think it pulls it off. Decent value too for a $6 bomber. Worth a try if you love West Coast IPA's."
"This is a Royal Rumbal of tastes. One sip and its piny, next sip it's froral. This beer keeps you one your toes. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. This is definitely a palate wrecker. I had with my dinner and didn't taste nothing but hops."

""
""
""
"Overall this is a superb DIPA."
"Palate Wrecker lives up to its name as it gets a bitter/astringent boost from both hop techniques in brewing and from alcohol. It's fun to explore what's familiar and what's unique in the bitter complexes in this heavily hop-tilted ale."
""
""

"Pours fairly dark for an IPA but the smell of that traditional piny west coast IPA hits you quick. The first few sips were top notch with that piny IPA very strong on the tongue. You quickly realize why it's called Palate Wrecker since it definitely burns out some taste buds the more you drink. For me, this Imperial IPA class is stacked with world class beers and this might have fell short of the upper tier by just a bit. Definitely a must try and one I'd go back to but the heaviness of the hops on the tongue made it fall just a tad short."
""
"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours clear copper with a two-finger length white head that dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are plentiful tiny bubbles visible rising in the glass. There are aromas of sweet and bready malts with citrus (grapefruit and orange) and piney hops. The hop aroma is pretty intense. The first sip lives up to the namesake of the beer. The hops burst in the mouth with the piney hops and the citrus hops are there, but not as strong. The malts are there in the backbone, providing some nice bready sweetness. The alcohol is well-masked here and I can't even taste it at all. This is an excellent beer."

"The beer appeared a deep, clear orange with a thick slightly off white head that was well retained and settled into a thin cap. Carbonation was noticeably rising from the bottom of the glass. The beer gave off a big, strong pine hop aroma...that was about it. I doubt anything else would have been able to cut it. The beer had a huge pine hop taste, overly so for my taste, with a very bitter aftertaste. The beer had a moderate to heavy feel, it was creamy, and was well carbonated. Overall, while I have grown tired of the style, this is still a quality beer and one that I would definitely drink again."

"The taste is a rich onslaught of sweet hops. The hoppy pine flavor is mostly strong in the finish. The start is sweet and slightly melony. This is full bodied and sticky. I like it, but I'm personally more a fan of drier IPA's. Still; this delivers when fresh."
"O: Excellent beer, not as good as I remembered last year's batch being however. Rather simple hop bomb beer, that's influenced by the West Coast style, but has enough malt backbone to make East Coast IPA fans happy."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, vibrant, orange-copper coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white layer of surface head. Aromas blast the nose with citrus and floral hops, both tart and resiny. Very inviting and powerful nose. Flavors are all over the palate. Initial blast of resiny hops, both oily and bitter, followed quickly by floral highlights and a tropical fruit blend of grapefruit and pineapple. The caramel malt backbone does its best to balance this behemoth. The hops also impart a solid spiced highlight, mostly pepper, throughout the brew. Tangy and very bitter aftertaste, leading to a slightly oily, dry finish. Tremendously crafted brew that tackles a tall flavor profile and keeps it all so very drinkable."
"Check it out. Not sure if my palate will recover so soon."
"The nose on this one is pretty nice. Shows good character without getting obnoxious and nice subtle tones that still give enough to keep it interesting. Flavor profile is definitely a palate wrecker as it's intense and rich and thick and leaves a lot on your tongue. But not so out there that its a laborious drinker. I can dig it."
"Bottled on 12-11-12, poured on 1-20-13 out here on the east coast. Pours a pretty copper, small head,And lots of bubbles throughout. Smells very nice. Great smell with tons of pine and grapefruit. Wow on the taste. Huge bitter pine here--meets the level of Short's Huma--and balanced in excellent fashion with sweet citrus. Goes down with a sweet candy-like quality, with just the right carbonation. Medium mouthfeel, slight prickles. Right on for style and hit the palate wrecking they were going for here. Really like this one."

"Pours a clear shiny copper with one finger thick white head, settling to a thin ring, with wispy lacing left behind. Smell: grapefruit peel, resin, mildly herbal, with caramelized sugar and a little stone fruit in the back. Was expecting something more aggressive. Taste: oily hop extravaganza.. grapefruit, lemon rind, almost over caramel, then boozy with aggressive herbal and pine flavors, plus peach towards the end of the sip, finishing dry with a totally hop-wrecked palate. A tasty and intense hop-fix, not sure of its place in the DIPA elite, but digging it. Bottled 12/11/12."

"Pours a deep golden amber with orangish accents. Big, fluffy two and half finger bright white head. Excellent retention and abundant lacing. A wallop of pineapple and mango and other tropical notes on the nose. You can almost feel the bitterness of the hops in the nostrils. A burst of pineapple, citrus floral notes, mango, a touch of caramel malt, and grapefruit rind bitterness that is balanced out on the finish by the sweetness of the unrelenting malt body. Huge malt backbone that is largely responsible for a chewy, smooth full-body; well carbonated. An excellent DIPA that should satisfy even the most ardent hophead's craving."

"Toasted apricot with a solid quilt of fine toasted cream foam. Unusual look for a IIPA. Lots of pine, tangerine, grapefruit (tons of grapefruit), some pineapple, nice dose of underlying biscuity malt with a touch of sweetness. Bitter, metallic, sweet, pine, resin, more resin, some grapefruit peel, some nice spicy hops - really hoppy (haven't said that in a while). Medium bodied with small, sharp fleeting carb leaves a active feeling beer with a character wet almost slick finish. Nice mouthfeel here. Good beer."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Big, fluffy, off-white head, high retention. Clear, copper body. Aroma includes a ton of grapefruit and pine, exploding from the glass. Taste is extremely bitter, pine dominating, some caramel malt sweetness in the distant background but certainly one of the most biting and bruising bitter beers available. Delicious, despite its out of balance-ness. Awesome."

"O: Its a solid DIPA. Well balanced yet hoppy enough to show its character. No wrecked palate though. Especially if you prefer a flurry of hops. Will definitely make sure to keep this on the rotation."
"Yeah, I've heard this claim from plenty of DIPAs before... This stuff pours a clear amber-gold topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises pine resin, citrus salad, and a kiss of booze. The taste finally brings the name's promise to fruition: The bitterness on display burned through my tastebuds like vikings at Lindesfarne. It was all rind, resin, oils, and whatnot, with no real hop flavors besides. An alcohol kick comes forth as well, creating a sense of vinyl/rubber when combined with the bitterness and the subsequently shell-shocked tongue. Things are too much for me, and they definitely detract from any kind of enjoyment on my part. Many pain winces were evinced. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, I suppose this beer delivers what it promises, but that's not really a good thing..."

"Looking forward to this one poured from bottle to pint glass, chilled. It has a cloudy iced tea color appearance with a decent white head and nice lacing. The sniff test reveals grainy grapefruit and tea/hemp ideas, just a bit skunky in a very nice way. Great aromatics here. The flavor introduces with heavy cereal grains and light malt sweetness, but the grapefruit hops are massive! The bitterness settles into a bit of an herbal edge as well and results in a highly delectable brew, particularly for the hop lovers. The body is medium-light and the feel solidly crisp. Wow, love it!"

"O: Green Flash Palate Wrecker stays true to its namesake and will surely find a niche among hopheads and gluttons for DIPA hop punishment. The 9.5% ABV aside, the IBUs on this brew are ridiculous and any hopes you had for tasting a complex or maltier brew after it have already been dashed. I can sip one every once in a while, but it's a specialty DIPA for sure."

"Strong hop flavor that gives it a over-the-top bitterness. The alcohol is also large and the carbonation is accurate for the style. Overall, this is an extreme brew."
"Medium to heavy bodied. Carbonation is just right, enough to keep the beer from getting bogged down in your mouth. Dry finish, but not as much as you might think."
"Overall impression - Spiteful just to be. This is a chore to drink."

"O: Quite a tasty beer. It's balanced, but just slightly in the favor of bitterness (which I prefer); it has a diverse, strong hoppy flavor; it's mouthfeel really ties things together, making this one easy to go through quickly in spite of its size."

"Medium bodied with a blast of dry resinous hops that provide a strong bitterness that lingers into a dry finish.  Earthy pine needle and spruce followed mid palate by citrus/tropical fruit notes that prevent it from becoming one dimensional.  Citrus rind, grapefruit and pineapple followed by biscuity malt and sweet booze.  Thin and a bit watered down but easy to drink.  Strong bitterness is nicely countered by sweeter notes but it's a bit too thin and boozy for my liking."

"pass."

"O - It's honestly a shame the taste on this beer is so awful, because everything else is actually rather good. But with the overwhelming dank, bitter flavor, it's hard to recommend this beer. I'll skip it in the future."
""
""
"What a unique beer that I will definitely have again."
""
"O - This is a big dipa and will be appreciated by ipa fans. The beer is aptly named, it is strong and aggressive in all areas, especially bitterness and hop presence. Good stuff for the initiated."
""
""
"O - Maybe the most tasty DIPA I have ever had. Yes, a palate wrecker. Anything you drink after this one is doomed. Sick brew..."
"O: A magnificent Double IPA and highly recommended for hopheads. Would drink again for sure."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. I really like the strength of the hops in this one and the bitterness. Does not get out of control though."
""
"O - Overall, I'd say this is a palate wrecker, but for me its also kind of a malt bomb. And malt bombs are something I really dont care for in my DIPAs. Wish this was a bit more citrus or pine heavy to drown out the sweetness."
"overall - definitely lives up to the name, but there are more enjoyable DIPAs."
"Overall, it is very reminiscent of the Green Flash West Coast IPA. There is a hint of copper, and that spiciness is persistent throughout. A nice heavy double, but not a citrusy as one would expect."
""
""
""
""
"O - I don't know if my palate was wrecked, but this is definitely a hop showcase and a very enjoyable DIPA."
"Drinkability - glad I had a chance to try it. I know a few hopheads on my block who I'll try to grab a few more for, but one and done for me. DIPAs are a tough style for me - I find many I don't necessarily care for, but I can't stay away from the style. The audacious use of ingredients with such generous abandon has a certain allure I keep coming back to."
"O - I don't think I have had a beer this bitter since Ruination."
""
"Very tasty DIPA. This isn't weak at all but there is a heavy hand of hops and malt for sure. Well balanced for sure with such a lingering hop bite I can see why it is the palate wrecker."

"overall, as advertised this one bombards the palate with an unmitigated assault of hops. not something i'd want more than one of in a sitting but i like it; will definitely be back for a revisit in the future."

"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small pine dry hop. In the taste, big pine like hops and a small note of alcohol in the end. A small bitterness and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in the aftertaste. Nice big to mellow pine hops all the way through, quite enjoyable."
"O: A real winner for Green Flash. It takes 1st place in my taste book for them, beating out their Imperial and West Coast IPA's. A seriously goof treat for serious IPA coneheads."
"O: Surprisingly well balanced for such a hop forward beer. The alcohol is nearly undetectable."
"O - I like it a lot. It's a step below Pliny, but not a big one."

"What’s in a name? This one delivers as advertised. A great hop bomb with tons of flavor and aroma. While difficult to consume, it is well worth the effort. One could discuss this beer at length as it holds up to warming. However, the palate screams for relief."

"12oz bottle. Pours a murky burnt orange color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Big whiff of piney and citrus hops. Slightly sweet. The flavor is very dry, piney bitter hops. Some sweet malt flavor but the piney hops dominate. Nice alcohol presence. Dry finish. Oily mouthfeel. This is certainly a bitter Imperial IPA. More malt presence than I expected. Overall, this is a great hoppy beer worth seeking out."
""
"O- I feel that I am quite biased towards hop focused beers so having said that this one is definitely among the best. The hop flavor is potent and quite the experience. The beer itself is pretty easy drinking and its only fault in my eyes is a slight alcohol flavor I could live without."
""
"I wonder if anyone at Hamilton's has tried this out in the dog bowl. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Baron's Marketplace in San Diego."
""
""
""
"Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer. Also I seem to never be happy- I usually complain about beer being too sweet, and now I'm complaining about a DIPA being too dry. Would buy again."
"o - palate wrecker indeed. thank you, sir, may i have another?"
"O: As warned, this strongly flavored beer assaults the senses and leaves a long-lasting bitter aftertaste with hints of grapefruit and pine. Quite bitter even among DIPAs. A less balanced alternative to brews like Hopslam, Stone Ruination or Hop Stoopid, all of which I definitely prefer to this strong and challenging beverage."
"Are there pellet hops here? Not enough aroma, somehow. Not what I'd expect from a SDPA."
""
""
""
"O: If you don't like overly bitter DIPAs, avoid this like the plague. If this is the kind of DIPA you're looking for (a completely unbalanced palate killer), then there are few better. Basically, if you're the kind who loves Dave's Insanity Sauce (guilty), then this will be right up your alley."
""
""
"Only reason I gave overall a 1.5 instead of a 1.0 is because it at least has a lot of alcohol."

""
"I really need to try this back-to-back with a Pliny the Elder."

""
"Overall, a bruiser of a Double IPA. Many beers try to achieve this level of over-the-top hop presence, but more often than not they fail for one reason or another. This one is spot on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice DIPA!"
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Very hoppy with plenty of bitterness but not overly done."
"This wasn't a bad beer, and it really lives up to its name, but I'm glad I only bought a single of it. I probably won't buy it again, simply because at this price I would rather buy FFF Dreadnaught (assuming it's available). Hopheads would love this beer. Just don't plan on drinking a different beer right after you have this one."

"22oz. bottle served in my Ommegang tulip. Pours a translucent honey gold with a creamy, three inch, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a quarter inch cap embedded with pinpricks and ringlets. Thin, textured clusters of lacing are present during the tasting and exhibit good adhesion. Nose expresses citrus rind, light, candied fruit, ethanol, an earthy character and honeydew melon. Taste follows nose; however the alcohol somewhat over-asserts itself, masking many of the qualities present in the nose. Finishes with a light, lingering, earthy bitterness that gradually dissipates between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a slightly oily texture and an even carbonation level. Overall, I have to say that I enjoy my DIPAs with a little more sweetness and tropical fruit; however, this was definitely a solid brew and worth trying."
""
""
"O - I get it. I do. But for me when bitterness overpowers flavour to such a degree, that's to the beers detriment."
"Overall, it is a hop bomb for sure, with enough sugar and complexity to not be over the top."
""
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the huge hoppiness in the nose and, more massively, in the taste. The beer was so bitter, metallic, and sweet, all coming in for a beautiful balance. For Green Flash this level of hop bitterness is to be expected, but for some it may be just a bit overwhelming."
"Ok, I have never given a 100% positive review, but this beer is pretty much perfect. A hop head's dream come true. Definitely one of the top three IPA's I have ever had, I would drink this over pliny the younger any day. My only gripe is that I wish it was available year 'round."
""
"D - This is a really well made, slightly dark and straight forward DIPA. The hops are pungently aromatic, but also strongly bitter which is good, since anything less would leave the thick malt cloyingly unbalanced. Nicely done, and quite drinkable for such a big beer."
"Overall: This beer is very well made and one of the more attractive beers I have ever seen. The hops are strong but well balanced by the malt. Booze are well hidden."
"O: This is indeed a palate destroyer; there is not much but a crap ton of hops here but man, is it tasty"
"Very happy with this one. A bit of malt would have been nice like Nugget Nectar, but then I suppose the hops wouldn't live up to the name. Truly does wreck the palate. Couldn't drink anything close to hoppy. Had a Bud Light the next day and it tasted pretty good. Just a warning. Would have this one again"
""
""
"O: I enjoyed trying this beer. Would get it again."
"O-- Good looking and smelling. Rest is crazy. Not a session beer. Slow sipper while pondering why go to these extremes for the sake of going there. One dimensional and goes from first gear to 4th."
""
""
"O - As a DIPA I loved this. Honestly, almost up there with PTY. I will always get this when I see it, and am telling my beer geek friends about this immediately."
""
""
""
""

"O- This is an outstanding imperial IPA. Haven't had anything like it before, and I congratulate Green Flash on coming up with something new, and not following the crowd. Fantastic."
"Hoppy and glorious, would recommend without a moment's hesitation. Glad I still have three more, cheers!"
"Bright copper orange in color with a slight haze. Poured with a big frothy off white head that stayed strong to nearly the last sip. Big sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Smooth and oily feel with subdued carbonation. Tangerine and pineapple aromas with a light biscuit malt undertone. Ripe citrusy tagerine and pineapple flavors upfront with floral hop flavors through the middle that slowly transition to a bitter pine hop finish. Bitterness lingers for a while. The higher abv is well masked by the hop bitterness and light bready malt undertone."
""
"True to it's name, but that's not exactly a good thing."
"Decent. A nice big hop flavor here, and way bitter. It could actually use a little more malt to back it up. Palate not quite wrecked, but definitely bent."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, like all green flash beers this doesn't have a bottled on date. The color is a dark mahogany with a large off white small bubbled foamy head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of pine and grapefruit good with a little caramel. The feel is medium to a little heavy. The taste is overly good, nice amount of hops with caramel although not as tasty as fresh."
"West Coast IPA remains my fav from Green Flash, but this is worthy of trying. I'd stick to one at a time though, and make it a closer."
""
""
""
"O- A nice DIPA. Not the most balanced DIPA available. A real HOP BOMB. Hop heads, seek this one out."
""
"Bottle: Poured a bright orangey color ale with a solid large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma is dominated by citrus and pine noted originating from the C-hops. Taste is also dominated loads of citrus and pine notes with a bitter finish. Malt is present though hard to decipher through al the hops with some light residual sugar. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. There is no denying that this a hop bomb though I prefer when they veered toward floral then bitterness."
"A nice DIPA which lives up to its name. Plenty of bitterness but it lacks a bit of finesse as the hops are very piney and lack some good floral character."
"O- There is nothing wrong with this beer!! It is exactly how an ipa ought to be. The flavor is so rich and strong and enjoyable. I got to find more of this! "
"Overall this was a nice brew. No signs of ABV, good bitterness without being excessive. Sweetness helps mellow it all out."
""
""
"Pours a golden orange hue looking exactly like lucozade and leaves a two finger head that stays and leaves a rim of creamy clingy lacing,the smell is pineapple,fresh piney hops,boiled candy and bubblegum,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and a tad syrupy with tastes almost identical to smell with hints of pineapple,grapefruit,lemonade bitter lemons,bubblegum,boiled candy and finished with a sherbet bitterness and overall its a nice drop really is what it says it is and i would definately buy again cheers."
""
"Overall. I can see that this is meant to be pretty extreme and all, but it's really a bit much. Feels like my tastebuds are numb ...and I still have half a bottle left!"
"Foams up over three fingers of off-white, delicate with a few deep dimples, retains well at about a finger, the lacing doesn’t stick as you think it might, you get a few, albeit thick, streaks here or there. Murky to opaque orange rust colored liquid, more red than yellow tint, very few visible bubbles. The nose is classic, lots of orange to grapefruit citrus, pine, honeyed bread, flowers, pepper and milk chocolate, fills out with resonant pineapple, peach, nectarine fruit scents, thick and syrupy nostril texture, too dense to really lift much. Full-bodied, the carbonation relatively light for the heaviness you get here too, glues itself to your mouth pores as well. Pine sap, cocoa, orange and both white and pink grapefruit pith, the bitterness creates the initial impression of dryness, however, it stays juicy through the flowers and pineapple, mango, nectarine, apricot fruit. The pepper and earth components extend the finish, lots of reverb, even more prickle than expected with the so-so carbonation. Isn’t breaking new flavor territory but amplifies everything while staying well balanced. That honey sneaks out onto stage through the finish, brings some caramel and molasses along. Impressive."
"Pours a semi clear amber with a about 1.5 fingers of light tan head that leave a thin lacing with each sip. I smell citrus and hops that are more like pine than grass. This beer tastes great in the mouth and then it smacks you with the hops. This is not for amateur beer palates. Excellent mouthfeel for an IPA. I really love Green Flash West Coast IPA and Double Stout as as go to beers, but I will most definitely buy this for my next beer tasting."
"Overall this lives up to my expectation of being quite the hop bomb. Green Flash nails it for sure. Doubt I would want more than 2; I am only just now able to feel my tongue again 24 hours later. Would definitely come back to this when I need a major hop fix."
""
"O: Well this beer is pretty absurd. Most hop forward and bitter beer I've ever had, totally unbalanced, which I respect. I'm a pretty big hop lover and this isnt my cup of tea per se, but I'm really glad I tried it."
""
"Wham! A hop punch in the face...without much malt backing it up. The earthy resiny pine is dripping on this one. Some bitter orange rind seeping through too. Also getting some """oniony""" flavor on the backend as well. Not the most balanced DIPA, but I don't think it's supposed to be. A good effort, but all things considered, I prefer Green Flash West Coast IPA to this one."
""
"O - A very enjoyable beer. Good drinkability, alcohol is well hidden. Great flavor, although not the most complex or distinct tasting double IPA I've had. Thankfully, """Palate Wrecker""" lives up to its name and delivers the goods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"i can see why it's named palate wrecker, it's so bitter it almost tastes like you're drinking burnt beer. i was hoping fr a tastier brew, hoppy, yet well balanced (at least with the hops... i mean, there are so many varieties you could just mix them all up, get a really high ibu count and have it be delicious!) but i guess this is probably what they were going for. i prefer their west coast ipa - but that's just me."
""

""
""
"Note: I believe that Sierra Nevada’s Hoptimum is better balanced while still the equal in power but both stand as the best DIPA/IMP IPA’s I have had this year to date."
""
"O: my personal Green Flash favorite. High ABV is disguised to allow one to endulge & enjoy multiple glasses."
"O: Not quite as balanced as pliney but if you're ever looking for a hop bomb, this is one beer I wouldn't hesitate to suggest. Now if you're looking for balance in your beer you should mosey on and find something else."
"O: This is most likely a bit past it's prime given the previous reviews mentioning more pine and grapfruit than tropical flavors in the finish. I actually like it with some age as it's less harsh than the super pine west coast DIPAs."
"O: West Coast big IPA's always seem to be a little too syrupy and boozy for me. This one hit it perfectly. It's a bitter bruiser with a ton of flavor. Definitely want more of this soon."
"I've been craving some West Coast hops, here we go...amber glowing copper body with a big billowing off white head, leaves fine speckled lacing. Aroma earthy, citrus grapefruit layers of hops, dank mary jane, you name a hop character or aroma and I'm sure you can find it in this beer. The one characteristic that reigns supreme in this beer is the grapefruit pith it just flows out of the glass, flavor wise it borders as a barleywine big assertive alcohol with malts wrapped around it. Gotta love the West Coast hops, more waves of bitterness and hop flavors including more grapefruit bombs, earthy dirt, and again marijuana. Evident sticky hop oils on the palate yet lighter bodied than most DIPA/B wines out there they kept the palate surprisingly clean for this type of a beer, moderate carbonation works with this type of beer excellent feel to it. Overall I'm impressed I had it on draft a couple years back at a Penn Fest and it blew my mind, I'm not saying I have the same feeling as I did then but it's damn good."
""
"Taste-Big shot of malt, then a wave of grassy, leafy hops that launch a bitterness assault that doesn't let up through the finish. Palate wrecker is right because the bitterness outbalances everything in this brew. Too one-sided for my taste."
""
"Overall, a solid 4.0 beer. It's interesting and complex enough to be called good, but perhaps lacks the refinement to go beyond that. Still, enjoyable and tasty on a cool rainy Sunday afternoon."
"MOREY’S BOTTOM LINE: This is obviously not super fresh. Does that mean that I shouldn’t review it? I think not. Who’s fault is it that there’s no date on this bottle afterall? It’s still a pretty tasty beer. It just taste like a hopped-up Barleywine at this point. As a DIPA however, it’s just too malty. I hope to have a fresh one sometime soon, and I can only hope that Green Flash starts to bottle date sooner rather than later!"

"Drinkability - 90% of beer drinkers won't want to finish a bomber of this ale, and 90% of the people who do won't be able to drink anything after this, thus the name. I found it to be slickly sweet and a great take on the style."
"Overall, I've got to say that this beer really opened up as it warmed during drinking and revealed a variety of hop decoction characters of the highest quality. Stunning. I would like to compare this side-by-side with similar styles one day."

"Very good, the bitterness in this beer is unreal, yet it has enough sweetness to not be out of balance."
""
""
"Body is medium to medium-heavy, with moderate carbonation to accentuate the thickness and lengthen the full-on hop effect on the palate. Mouthfeel is generally smooth, with little foaming action or carbonation crispness. Finish is expectedly dry, from hops and sugars from the huge malt bill."
"Picked this up while in San Francisco. Smells like roses, I mean west coast ipas. Pours a dark, clear amber/copper colour. Tastes very bitter and piney. It does as the name suggests and leaves a nice tingle feeling. The high 9.5% alcohol is well hidden with each sip though. Prefered this a little more on tap, but its still pretty solid in bottle too."
""
""
"O - God I can't get enough of this beer. And it really earns it's name of Palate Wrecker. I'm a hop head and I could care less about balance right now; give me more hops and more Palate Wrecker!"

"Green Flash Palate Wrecker pours a fairly hazy orange, with no real highlights to speak of. The pour yields three fingers or so of just off white foam. Head retention is fairly good, with some chunky, spotty lacing left behind. The nose is nicely potent, with a fair split of grapefruit and pine aromas shining through. The flavor leads off with just a hint of candied sugar and caramel sweetness. Quickly, a raw, aggressive, intense bitterness rolls through, filling up the mid palate. This is the kind of tongue shredding action you need if you're going to call your beer """Palate Wrecker""".The hoppy finish isn't as flavorful as I'd like. There's some amount of it, with the citrus component being more orange than grapefruit to balance with the resinous pine notes, but it's not attention grabbing. The mouthfeel isn't all that great, it's a little chewy and a little undercarbonated for the style. Palate Wrecker's got it's flaws, but it's a nice, aggressively bitter imperial IPA."
"Drinkability: Easily the best beer I've ever had from Green Flash, which is a brewery that - in my experience - makes consistently good beers, but never a world class beer. This is right up there w/ the Silva Stout from them, a coast-blending exercise in DIPAs, with enough east and west coast influences to make it very enjoyable. The 9.5% is right about where you'd want this one to clock in, but it's hidden well enough that this one's dangerously drinkable."
"Picked up a bomber at Brilbeck's in Syracuse for $7. Ah, this is a fine example of the DIPA style. Big floral, juicy grapefruit fills the aroma, while the flavor follows up with more spicy, grassy grapefruit. The finish isn't crisp, but a rounded and strong piney kick with citrus rind. The hops character covers a lot of ground and the malt isn't too sweet, as is the problem with some higher ABV DIPAs. Hop heads should check this out."
""
"Skål!"
""
""
"A nice, hoppy and bitter beer that really shines through with stone fruit flavors and some pine/resin."
""
"Green Flash Brewing Co. sure knows how to brew excellent west-coast style IPAs. Palate Wrecker is an excellent DIPA that’s chock full of delicious hop flavor. Frankly, this is quite a bit better than Green Flash’s Imperial IPA. Less malt and more hops seems to be a recipe for success. This is excellent stuff! Find some!"
"Delicious, and for any IPA or DIPA fan, you simply must check it out. It's like Green Flash's original IPA but twice as strong and twice as delicious."

"On tap at St Augustines in vancouver. This is the last beer you want to drink in the evening as it really obiterates all else with its huge hops and deep bitterness. It is strangely balanced and not too over the top. I liked the beer and appreciated the fact it delivered the goods while staying very drinkable for the style. I could only have one but that is all you need with this beer."

"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with beautiful fluffy head and massive lacing. Citrus, piney, aroma hangs heavy in the air deep with resin. Wow, very bitter and oily, with typically fantastic Green Flash citrus resinous hop profile. Thick mouthfeel with palate wrecking dry finish that hangs on the taste buds. Great hop forward imperial IPA - Chuck Silva does it again!"
"O - It does what the name implies. It wrecks your palette and leaves any hop head satisfied. A hop forward IIPA that isn't a huge malt bomb."

"Pretty large multidimensional hoppiness here. I like it though more than one at a time would be excessive. Something like this needs to be enjoyed sparingly."
"Lives up to its name. Intensely bitter, yet still quite fruity with a green, fresh hop candy presence. I like how it manages to move beyond just massive amounts of citrus. Quite well done, but something keeps it from being really great."
""
"O - A hop heads delight, lots of strong hops but not over the top bitter. Good brew"
"certainly seems more than 100 ibu. Just too bitter, despite piney hops and sugars. Better done than other super high bitter beers, there is some taste. Golden red colour. Not my favourite great DIPA.I like their regular very hoppy IPA just fine.Boozy."
"The mouthfeel was medium to full with modest carbonation."
""
"The taste is fantastic. It's just a huge punch of bitter hops. There's layers of complexity here for the hophead to peel back, just like in the nose. The mouthfeel is heavier but briskly carbonated, it leaves the mouth coated without feeling heavy. The drinkability is fantastic. Overall, this is a great double IPA for the unrepentant hophead. Don't look for full malt flavors here to balance this out."
"O: Well, I was expecting my palate to be wrecked and it wasn't! However, I was rewarded with a bitter, hop-forward, yet still very well balanced DIPA that I found quite enjoyable to drink."
""
"Flavors are similar, big caramel and toasty malts, smooth and buttery. Moderate hop bitterness, slick and resiny. Buttery diacetyl is present but not overly distracting. Full bodied with lower carbonation and some sticky caramel sweetness. It has an English feel, much like Schells Burton Ale. Dry bitterness lingers, reminding that it's in fact a double IPA..."
"O - I like this beer. It's harsher on the tongue than their West Coast IPA for sure, which is sometimes just what the hop doctor ordered. Wouldn't want it every day but would like to have it around. Good stuff."
""
"Count it as one more good hop related nectar to come out of San Diego."

"Overall - This beer is as advertised, a hop bomb with ultra high ibu's. Totally a hophead beer, with minimal malt and yeast. If you want a monster, this is for you."

"I gotta say between this and Rayon Vert, Green Flash has been pumping out some great new beers in a 12oz format at affordable rates. I could drink two 12ozer's of this in a sitting no problem.

"An Imperial IPA that improves as it warms up, fabulous!"
"Overall impression: Not sure my palate is """wrecked""" but it's been taken behind the woodshed and it's been shown who's the boss. The alcohol is a touch on the hot side but I wouldn't want to age it for fear of the hops fading. Well done!"

"O: This is too malty for a Double IPA. Where as the best (Pliny, Heady Topper, Hopslam) seem to find that happy medium of balance, this fails. Yet this does seem worthy of its name. The alcohol is very well hidden. I'm not blown away, but not bad."
"O- Lives up to the name and is a solid DIPA. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden, and I feel this is pretty easy to drink. Definitely provides a good hops fix."
"Overall, this is a nice big, bitter, and bold DIPA. It's name fits it, because it's pretty abrasive, but I dig it. Not super unbalanced, but certainly well tipped towards the hops/bitter side."
""
"O: The onion and garlic flavours were too predominant for me to enjoy this beer. Given the other reviews, it makes me wonder as to why this was the case; since I had a fresh palate walking into this beer and I love hop bombs. What I do know is that this is no Stone Ruination or Pliny the Elder, and that adding more hops does not always equal a better beer. A brewer said to me that adding a lot of hops to a beer is like adding a lot of salt to a dish. It seems like Green Flash added too much onion and garlic salt on this one."
""
""
"Another impressive offering from Green Flash. I'd really like to see them in GA (for now I have to trade or pick them up on my semi-regular trips to Asheville). Palate Wrecker is no misnomer- in my opinion this sticks on the tongue with a bitter potency that Stone's Ruination never quite achieves. Worth a try if you want a seriously bitter hop-forward DIPA without the typically biscuity malts. Thanks again for the great surprise, Reza!"
""
"O: This is one of the best west coast IPAs I've had. I love almost all of this brewer's offerings but this is really amazing. It doesn't so much wreck my palate as wreck my ability to enjoy other IPAs."
"O: Couldn't ask for more from another great west coast DIPA that will for sure wreck your palate."
"Drinking this is like having a chile pepper eating contest; if you like spicy food, you'll jump at that challenge any time; if your idea of hot is a dash of tobasco sauce, then you'll bow out. Same here; serious hop-heads will like the challenge of this aptly names ale; everyone else will poo-poo this as over the top nonsense. I fall in the fire-breathing mouth wrecker category, and am enjoying this ale. Sadly, its intensity is making me regret that I've got all 22 ounces of this to myself."

"overall: fierce and abrasive - worth a bomber"

"Truly fantastic, especially considering how smooth it is for an over-the-top beer that it is advertised as. Rather than wrecking my palate, I don't think I'd be able to drink one bottle alone of this and end up merely buzzed. This will appeal to all fans of DIPAs as well as California pale ales, but may also work for fans of cocktales and barleywines. Wish it wasn't so expensive (8 dollars), or I'd definitely pick it up more at my local store than cheaper, harder-to-find beers of its kind such as Pliny."
"O: Nice strong double IPA, as intense as you'd expect."

"This one gives Hopslam a run for it's IIPA money. Big, bold, and full of flavor."
""
""
"This is a pretty damn good beer. I feel like it's reaching a bit too hard for the highest IBUs possible title, but it's still great with a noticeably good malt to back up the hops. Hops are done very well. You can tell many types were used and they all got along with one another. Love the nectar flavor brought out by both the malt and hops."
"This poured out as a nice looking copper color with a foamy thick white head on top. the smell of this beer was hoppy, lots of piney citrus with some grapefruit notes in there too. The taste of the beer got a little better as it warmed up but wasn't quite what I was hoping for in the beer. The mouthfeel was well carbonated, medium bodied and a little oily. Overall this beer was good, it's bound to please just about any hop head out there but I feel that I've had much better IIPA's."
""
"M/O - Medium body that is well carbonated and nice viscosity. Easy to drink but not a sipper. The floral taste lingers for a while. Overall I was honestly expecting more but I prefer the West Coast IPA over this one."

"O: I enjoyed this even more than I did when I had it on-tap. Just a really outstanding Imperial IPA. Hope Green Flash keeps making this bad boy. Sit back, pop the bottle open, and relax. Perfect IPA for enjoying the warm weather."
"Pretty good hop bomb, This beer has a lot of hype around it but I've had better DIPA's. Still a solid brew. I'd get it again."
"Not sure that I could correctly taste a beer properly after this one as it is a palate wrecker for sure."

"12oz bottle from a four pack that cost $12. I was excited to try this and while it was a decent DIPA it just really wasn't my bag. Nice orange color, thick head, thick lacing. Smells like a bit of pine, strong hops which I like but I wasn't quite wowed. The flavor is extremely bitter but also has a strong caramel flavor from the malts. Kind of sweet too which I did not care for. Overall, above average but I won't be buying any more."
""
""
""
"O. Very unique and interesting. The taste is vastly different from when it first hits the palate to the aftertaste that comes at the end. Complex."
""
""
"O- If you're a hop head this one's for you. I really enjoyed this one."
"O - personally I felt this was a bit too sweet and not quite balanced. Yet an interesting DIPA overall."
"D - I really like this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - one of the better tasting Dub/Imp IPA's around."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a cloudy amber/orange color with an inch off-white frothy head that sticks around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (tangerine, orange, grapefruit) and pine hops, and a bit of caramel malt. However, I don't pick up quite as much citrus in the taste (as compared to the aroma). Mostly I taste a lot of bitter pine hops, along with some citrusy hops (mango, grapefruit) and a little caramel malt. There's a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's lick and creamy with good carbonation. Overall I think this is a good brew and I'd buy it again in the future. $8.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great, except for the overly bitter finish. Overall, a good beer, but not the best."
""
"Overall – This was a bitter pine IPA if I have ever had one. With its intense nature, its potent flavors overload the bitter taste buds on the tongue. A bitter IPA’s lover’s kind of beer, and one I actually found quite pleasurable (even though I would consider myself a sweeter IPA kind of guy)."
"Definitely get this if you find it but don't expect to be able to taste anything afterwards."
""
""
"This one lives up to the name. Huge piney hops, big mint, some citrus. Malt whispers but hops just beat it back down. Booze is there but not in the way. Medium plus on the body, good carbonation. Hops linger for days. This one numbs the tongue. A must for hopheads."
"O: man... this beer doesn't taste very good. I love hoppy beers, but man... this isn't good much at all. It's painful as you're swallowing it. Give it a try, but I bet you won't keep seeking for this (like me)."
"Not my favorite DIPA but drinkable. If you like your IPAs on the bitter side, this one is for you. Not much grapefruit notes if any."
"O - all in all a pretty solid, yet underwhelming IIPA that hits alot of the normal areas but doesn't standout in any of them. The hop bite and burn is nice but the alcohol could be better blended. Also the overall taste lacks something yet seems to linger too long. Nice possibilities but just misses in too many areas. Wouldn't turn one down in the future but don't think I'll seek it out in the future."
""
""
"Overall - Delicious beer. For severe hop lovers for sure."
"My previous experience with this beer had been on cask during a visit to San Diego and I have to say that I really enjoyed this more here out of the bottle. I still feel that it’s a little too big overall but the fresh hoppy power of this wins out in the end, helping cover up the high ABV. This is a nice representation of the West Coast style."
"Pours a nice golden orange, solid cap of dense white foam, good retention and lacing. Huge notes of tropical, citrus and floral hops - grapefruit, orange, mango and light pineapple, moderately sweet malt base stands up nicely to the hops but dont interfere in the bouquet. Taste brings juicy and fruity hops with a little more earthiness, malt is lightly sweet and notable in the taste and play with the hops nicely. Fuller side of medium bodied, oily creamyness, lingering bitterness. Solid dIPA with big hop presence and a malt backbone to stand up to it."
"O: A pretty good DIPA, not quite a palate wrecker but definitely bitter and astringent and hop-froward to the extreme."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's getting harder and harder to separate your DIPA from the next guys and I think Green Flash is on to something here. I can s we this beer being polarizing but with that said its well worth a try is you like dank highly hopped beers."
"Update: Almost a year later I'm going to update--scores all the same. This one was bottled on 12/17 (less than a month ago). It is ridiculously piney smelling. Also get a bit of marijuana. Flavor is really nice--really need to sip it to not be assaulted by bitterness. Aftertaste is the only piece that I'm not loving. Still a great beer."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This is definitely a bitter dipa and a good one at that. Probably one of my favorite from GF. Not my favorite hoppy beer though, but definitely worth seeking out."
"Overall: An insanely bitter, and tasty IPA that truly lives up to it's name; drinking this is almost akin to chewing through hop cones. What really surprises me so much about this is the fact that it is 9.5%, yet isn't sweet. I was so happy that Green Flash brought this seasonal back from last year. Highly recommended to anyone who loves IPAs and especially excessively bitter ones!"
"I don't know if the bottle I got had turned bad but me and a buddy split the bottle and the smell was almost enough to turn our stomachs. I was the first to give it a sip and I can honestly say the taste was worse than the smell. My buddy almost didn't try it based on my reaction because he knows I like stronger beers than him. But he took a sip and about spit it back out. I can honestly say that this is the first beer I have ever dumped out. I will not be taking a chance on this beer again."
"O: This is an excellent DIPA. It can be a bit brutal up front, but still very drinkable and a great example."
"The malt is there with a slight bready sweetness but the sweetness gets over taken by the hop flavors. You can tell its a big beer too a bit of alcohol burn on this one. Im also noticing it leaving a very dry parched aftertaste. Its really intense after a while and truly is a palate wrecker."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very solid brew. The flavors are clean and well defined. Glad i could try it and will look for it in the future."
""
"O: Another amazing West Coast IPA. Imagine that...."
""
" I would definitely drink this again and may even throw one in the cellar to see if it will get any sweeter when the hops fade a little - (If ever)."
""
""
"Overall an excellent DIPA. I will purchase this in cases going forward, and hope Green Flash will start being distributed in Mississippi once we are past the start date of higher ABV sales here. Cheers!"
"Poured into Chimay glass. The appearance is a deep clear gold with 2 fingers of dense white head, heavy lacing left behind, terrific head retention. This looks picture perfect for a DIPA. The aroma has aromatic dry hopped goodness all over it. Bright tropical notes are balanced by deep notes of resinous pine with some grapefruit in there as well. Malts are present on the nose in the form of sweet caramel, bread, and graham cracker. The taste is big and bold with hops from beginning to end. The malts are present up front with mellow bready sweetness, dank hops quickly take hold as this thing is a hop monster. The deep bitterness of the pine is brightened up by some tropical fruit. The body is big and the carbonation is moderate to high. Overall, this beer has a truly impressive hop bill. The aromatic hops and the bittering hops are balanced beautifully and there is a nice sturdy malt backbone which holds everything up. This brew is fantastic, a definite must try."
"O - Smells awesome, the taste loses some of the citrus, but is still good."

"I wouldn't call this a total palate wrecker, I'd just call this a real solid IPA. Quite enjoyable."

"Overall, a winner. A double IPA that hides the alcohol so well that it makes the beer entirely drinkable."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light to medium coppery amber, massive fine off-white head with good retention and tons of lacing. Color, head and active carbonation give a nice look to this IPA. Intense aroma of grapefruit, pine and herbal hops and sweet malt. Flavor follows, with intense piney hops, citrus balanced by sweet malt. A long, resinous bitter hop finish and aftertaste. The malt supports the hops assault well. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess and nice mouth feel from the healthy carbonation. I opened this with a bit of trepidation because Green Flash ales are sometimes a bit astringently bitter for me and this was named to put fear into my heart. It is very hop forward, but the malt body supports it well and I enjoyed this very much. Nicely done, but you really have to like intense hops."
"O- The taste is somewhat deceiving and starts out a little sweet and then the hoppy bitterness takes over. I opened this beer just slightly too cold but as the temperature rose the flavor became more complex. This is called palate wrecker for a reason. Drinking most beers after drinking this would be very low on taste. (and why would you want to) As a hophead this beer really hits the spot. Well done!"
"The palate is pretty excellent. Big, bold, resiny and mildly sweet, this does make a strong case for its name. Bold pine and grapefruit, with less weed than the nose would suggest, this is wonderfully resiny and bitter, juicy, mildly fruity and nicely palate-coating. Some sweetness is present, but really, this is a wonderful example what a mindfully bitter DIPA should be. The sweetness is a little more than I like, though. Medium-light in body with mild-moderate carbonation, this feels pretty great on the palate. Bitter, resiny, hoppy finish with a mildly green hop character, this is pretty excellent. The sweetness is increasingly noticeable as I work through the bomber, not enough to make me slow down, but enough to be noticed. Recommended, especially if you can find (more reasonably priced) 12oz bottles."
"D/O: When naming a beer, the brewer may want to take care not to promise too much. Such warnings aside, this beer fulfills its namesake promise very ably by cultivating an obnoxiously self-conscious level of bitterness. Despite the punishing intensity of its bitterness upon the palate, the dank green flavors match it well, making it an appropriate beer to review on 4/20."

"pretty decent DIPA. nothing really bad about it. enjoyable."

"O: A-"

"D/O: A little heavy on the """bitter""" and pine for my liking. Not quite as much grapefruit/citrus reward as my *favorites*. Overall, a good IPA. Certainly one I'd revisit at a later date, but not something I'd choose to revisit tonight."
""
""
"O - my favorite beer to date. Haven't had much to this point being a young BA guy, but damnit, my palate is in love with this hop bomb. Must buy for me. Will be picking up more for sure!"
"The body is medium and works to support the big flavor. Malts keep it from being bracingly dry. Crispness is in this one throughout, and there's a good smoothness that pulls into the finish."
""
"Don't know much about this one, sounds interesting, Green Flash's version of Ruination? Just a guess based on the name. Poured from bottle pint glass the hop aroma is immediately present upon the pour. The beer arrives a slightly hazy orange color with a good 2 finger white cap, decent retention and lacing. The beer is a hop bomb so the aroma is heavy on the hops. Mostly citrus with a bit of pine. I love hops but this is almost so strong it's uninviting. The beer is bitter, not nearly to Ruination's level but bitter. Unbalanced. Very resiny with pine and earthy tones more prevalent than the nose suggests. Hides the alcohol well though. Hops dominate any malt base. Full bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, not bad but nowhere near balanced. 1 is enough."
""
"Overall. Great DIPA, extremely hoppy and nice and bitter. As it warms it continuous to be a palate wrecker with some more resinous note notes precent."

"Slight mess of a brew, but a west coast hop bomb nonetheless. Flavor is overwhelmingly bitter without enough sweetness or smoothness. Recommended, but for only the biggest of hopheads."
"Food Pairing - BBQ, BLT, french fries"
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, although there are better 2IPA’s out there, this is still a solid beer to drink for a long time."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big orange, caramel, pine, biscuit, grapefruit, mango, floral, honey, light herbal, and a touch of alcohol. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, caramel, honey, biscuit, herbal, floral, and mango. Fairly intense pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, honey, pine, biscuit, and caramel on the finish for a good bit. Despite the intense hoppiness, there is a nice malt backbone to balance it out. Good flavor balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Smooth to drink but it is still a sipper. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a good sized warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and highly enjoyable DIPA. Nice malt balance and hop flavor profile."
""
"Overall-- very bitter... I just it were more hop-forward in terms of flavor. Not bad, but nothing here to set the DIPA world ablaze with excitement. It does an adequate job covering the alcohol level."

"This is my first offering from Green Flash and I freakin love it. I know not all their beers will be like this, but it definitely makes me want more. Without a doubt, the most hop-intense beer I've ever had."

"I like what Green Flash tried to do here. As a hop head I will always promote the extreme. The flavor is solid and really does showcase almost all of what hops can do. It's not nearly as hoppy, bitter, or intense as the name would lead one on to believe, but overall it's a good DIPA."
"Overall, if you're a hophead, then this beer should be at the very top of your """must try""" list, because you're really not going to find a brew that better showcases what can be done with a skilled, intelligent application of this ingredient. Just don't expect to taste much of anything when you're done--if the hops don't take care of that, the 9.5% ABV will."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, abrasive with the hops, and grassiness and herbs."

"Overall (4.5): Great beer. Love it. It could definitely be a bit more balanced, and I’ve had DIPAs with a more nuanced or complex hop profile, but this beer promised an unrelenting hop experience and that’s exactly what it delivered. Very, very happy to have enjoyed this bastard, and I look forward to wrecking myself again in the future."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours amber in color with large white head. Lacing lasts well throughout the session. Aroma is lightly malty, caramel, toasted grain, resiny/hoppy, and grapefruit with alcoholic notes. Moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter finish. Full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, and moderately alcoholic. A very nice hoppy beer!"

"O- Well made beer, but not my favorite example of the style."
"Medium body with a light carbonation."
"O- Starts out a little weak but punishes you in the end. A good and dynamic one this is."
"overall - great beer, lots of nice hop character, big bodied and delicious, alcohol is well hidden (nice to see this IIPA just under 10%)"
""
""
"O: another great imperial-style IPA, in the same line as Shipyard's XXXX, Burton Baton, and the 471 IPA - if you like woodsy, piney, citrusy strong abv IPAs, then this is right up your alley"
""
"O - Not as impressive as anticipated. I was expecting more notes of smell and taste, but it's a solid ale for summer days and when you're in need of a little bite."
""
""
""
""
"my favorite green flash brew so far. a hophead's dream here. pours a barely red honey color with a proper white head on top. smell is a floral hop bouquet and some yeast with a belgian feel, or at least that fruity/spice hefe feel to it. flavor is not all hops, although they are clearly dominant. i also taste orange, pale malts, and a touch of honey. this is an excellent springtime imperial ipa. it just has something light and airy about it, despite how massive it is. feel is very very brightly carbonated and the body is squarely medium. one beer definitely gets ya buzzed too, no matter who you are. i suggest this one highly, its fantastic"
""
"This beer is like biting into a raw hop, and not in a good way, unless you like a biting bitterness. There is certainly no false advertising, this will wreck your palate. It's worth a try, but this just wasn't for me, there are far too many complex imperial IPAs out there."
""
"Overall: The complex taste of this beer makes you want to take your time with it and explore. As previously said, the high bitterness rate, not to mention the high ABV, make this one a sipper for sure. Save this beer for later in the night - it really will wreck your palate. Very solid beer. 3.75/5"
"Note: this is less sweet."
""
"O: Like the OB Deviant Dale's, this is definitely targeted at hopheads; however, the strong lingering bitterness doesn't fall back well on any malt. This is good to remind me what bitterness tastes like every once in awhile, but I definitely prefer Green Flash's other hoppy offerings."
""
"Clear golden color with a very yellowish head. Classic massive west coast nose, reminiscent of green flashes west coast ipa. Great lacing. Notes of fresh pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, with touches of peaches mangos and pine. Big full body with well blended flavors, the same that are on the nose. Hop bitterness is high. A little tart. Extremely drinkable at 9% but not a huge difference from green flash west coast ipa to this. Its very good but im not sure why the two exist side by side. Finish is a bit longer on this one though if your one of those people that like those hops to line their teeth."
"Palate wrecker indeed, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall, I'd love to get this again. In my top 5 DIPA's. Not to easy to get on the East Coast, though."
"This was a very new experience for me. I'm glad to have it. I recommend checking it out. Just know that this beer does not play well with others."
"This one takes it up a notch (or 10) and is very aptly named. A must try if hops are your thing."

"This is an excellent beer for a hop-head like myself, but my wife says that she would rather chew aspirin than take another sip. Lives up to their moniker."
""
"This is a DIPA worthy of revisiting many times. Would be deadly in a bomber unless you knew and respected the high abv."
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the palate with dryness. I'm happy to see they finally bottled this one - it's a great example of extreme hop presence and bitterness, even if it's slightly unbalanced at times."
""
"This is a really nice DIPA. It's not exactly mind blowing, but very well done.."
"O: A must-have for the hop head. I'm not a fan of summit hops (I assume that's the onion/garlic hop flavor) so I wasn't the hugest fan, but it was still quite good. Palate wrecker indeed, this is basically Devil Dancer Junior."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. I have drank so many DIPA's this year it's hard for me to find one that blows me away. This beer was good but not great and I'll take a Pliny over this any day."
""
""
""
"This is so good! Definitely the top of the heap for DIPA's. Palate numbing bitterness is definitely appropriate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Palate numbing bitterness delivers as promised. Summit hops with plenty of alpha acids, the aroma isn't very pleasant but it's a true treat for hop heads. Alcohol is well hidden. I have to say that this beer delivers what is promised, well done Green Flash."
""
"O - Massive, massive hop-bomb of a DIPA. If you want to know what chewing on hop-cones feels like, pick this one up. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O - If you arent looking to session, try this beer. If you like big, impressionable brews, try this beer. It's an experience as well as a fun brew."
"Overall - It definitely has more hop bite that the regular green flash or even the DIPA green flash. I really enjoyed it and would probably pick it up ahead of the other green flash varieties. The hoppiness ranks up there with SN hoptimum in my books."
""
"O: Very good on taste and mouthfeel, palate wrecker indeed"
"O: This is a DIPA of a different breed, and truthfully I don't quite know what to make of it. It is intensely bitter, but to the point of sacrificing some of the more pleasant, citrusy hop tastes. The pepper-like taste hinders drinkability a little, and I can see it coming across as too boozy for some. It is at least aptly named. This was a one-and-done for me."
"Overall: between this, West Coast and Imperial IPA, it seems like Green Flash is doing something right. The onion and garlic may throw some folks off, but this is an above average beer from an above average brewery. Well done, boys."
"Overall - this is a pretty intense brew! Not bad at all for the style, but maybe a bit much for my palate...although...hence the name."
"This is an excellent beer with an extreme complexity....but there is nothing really """special""" about it. The beer is super bitter with lots of different flavors, but not one that stands out as excellent. It is an excellent sipping beer, but not one that would necessarily want to have on home-draft even though I am primarily a Imperial IPA fan. Overall, this beer just really does not do it for me."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, no bottle date on bottle or 4 pack. Pours a clear orange red with a three quarters of an inch yeas with awesome lacing. Smell is lots of grapefruit, some onion, garlic, tangerine, grass, pineapple, and pine. Taste wow Devil Dancer and Double Crooked Tree come to mind. Lots grapefruit and garlic, with all those other flavors in the nose, in supporting roles, maybe some booze that lingers with the grapefruit. Body is large, but unlike many Imperial IPAs this all about the hops, the malt barely has a cameo. Plenty of life, not dry, and for me very drinkable. Love this beer, it is not for everybody. This would be a selection in hop head heaven."
""
"see ya on the next one."
""
"Pours a light clear copper with a thin foamy white head with ample lace. Exceptionally malty nose with mild citrus and grapefruit rind. Flavor is exceptionally bitter and dry, loads of resin and a robust malt presence as well. Bitter? yes. But also a little too sweet and sugary. Disappointing from Green Flash, particularly after Rayon Vert turned out so enjoyable."
""
"Drinkabilty- It is delicious. I love it. One of the best! The hops in there are so wonderful!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Was really hoping for more from this beer as I love almost everything that Green Flash produces; not bad, but the onions and sweetness on the finish reduce its appeal to me"
""
"O: As I said before, most beers that are over-the-top hoppy strike me as novelties, but this one is actually pleasant. Still, it strikes me as a slightly more extreme version of Ruination, which is easier to get and a lot cheaper, so I'm not sure how often I'll seek this one out."
"O - Awesome IPA and lives up to its name, my palette is trashed!"
""
"Intense and aromatic. This beer hits you hard right from the start. Classic West Coast IPA with citrusy, piney nose, full bodied flavor and over the top hoppiness taste. Strong notes of grapefruit and toasted bread. Every sip leaves you wanting another. At 9.5%, a 22 oz'er is all the name says it is - a palate wrecker. Outstanding effort from the guys in San Diego."
"This is truly an amazing beer and I look forward to my next encounter."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace forms down the glass with each sip. Smell is of citrus zest, grapefruit, and herbal hops. Taste is of intense citrus zest, citrus fruit, and grapefruit extract. There is a pretty assertive bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slight crispness and a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it's quite hoppy without any real malt presence."
"I'd like to shake the hand of whoever recently lit a fire under Green Flash. Between Palate Wrecker and Rayon Vert, they are a huge two for two with new beers. I've always liked their stuff, but I didn't expect anything quite this excellent."
"Blistered...that's what your tongue feels like after the first sip of Green Flash's latest DIPA entry. There is a good reason they call this bad boy “Palate Wrecker”, there is nothing smooth or subtle about this brew. It's an in your face HOP A-BOMB! This brew pours a brilliant golden orange with a fingers worth of a white head that leave nice lacing. The aroma is amazing and is very reminiscent of “Pliny the Elder” in that it has big citrus and pine notes to it. My first thought after I tasted it... “What the %^&* just happened to my tongue?” I could feel my pupils dilate as my taste buds were obliterated by a bitterness like I've never tasted before. There is absolutely no malt backbone to balance out the hop bitterness but who cares? That's why I bought this beer, to be blown away by a super hoppy beer and “Palate Wrecker” more than fits the bill."

"Palate Wrecker is not a name that leaves you wondering why they called it that. This is one of the most bitter beers I have ever tried, and I like it. Less floral and fruity than Green Flash's other IPA's this beer pours a very light copper color and hits you with hardcore hop and long lasting burnt bitter flavor. While this is a beer worth appreciating, it's hard to see myself drinking more than one at a time, the appealing flavors of the IPA don't really seem to be existent. In that sense, it doesn't live up to the advertisement on the bottle that it is a very complex beer, more it's an experimental specialty brew pushing the limits of layered dry hopping in the IPA style."

"The mouthfeel is a little above average with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer. It had a pretty bold, bitter, resiny hoppiness to it which fit the name of the beer pretty well."
"Looks like crisp golden hay but nice thick head. Smells of piney hops, but slight citrus and sweet. Taste is of very strong hop and pine flavors. A bit of pineapple/grapefruit and cotton candy. Very nice and surprising DIPA. Worth trying if you see it..heck, if you see this on tap, im sure there are other great brews to try, but still worth a taste for sure. Enjoy."

"O: This is pretty solid. I'd buy more if they bottle dated."

"O - I was happy to snag this beer a few weeks ago in VA the first day it came in. There was no question to its freshness, which is important for a beer like this. It isn't quite a one-sided hop bomb, but it isn't far off. It lives up to it's name and I certainly wouldn't sample more beers of the style following this due to the tainted palate you will inevitably experience. It was a bit pricey, but I will get it again. Worth trying if you are a hop-head, but if you are easily turned off by bitterness, shy away."

"Hell yes, That's all I want to start off saying. I just tried this beast last night and was so glad I did. I found it at a home brew shop in orange and I coincidentally was going there to buy a bag of hops. I simply just love the smell of hops, nothing better. I have really grown to like IPA's as of recent because of the mix between different hops and aromas that really come out. This beer smelt like a true hop king. I wanted to sit there smelling it all night. The appearance was good, but with a smell like it had, i didn't much care what it looked like. The taste was great too, again, if your a hop lover, otherwise be prepared for a smack in the face. I am not going to say there is nothing else to the beer, but the hops are so prevalent it was hard for me to taste much else. Mouth feel was good, strong. Bitter enough u didn't want to let it sit there terribly long. Overall a must try for IPA fans!"
"Thank god we finished our bottle of Churchill's Finest Hour before touching this monster. A true palate wrecker."
"On tap at the Common Table in Dallas. The beer pours a clear gold/yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the hops. I get a lot of orange citrus and pine notes, as well as some caramel malt to keep things balanced. The flavor is definitely all about the hops. I get a ton of bitterness as well as some bitter oranges and pine notes. The caramel malt is hidden in the background and plays a secondary role. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a trickster. I let it sit in my mouth and it tastes like a bitter but on the swallow is a huge punch in the mouth of hop flavor. this beer went from 'why did I buy a four pack' to 'I'm glad there's more!'"
"O: a good IPA, overall. It manages to be sticky, earthy, and bitter without being too much so."
"This is a good example of a beer that doesn't try to be balanced, but is still well done. This brewery knows what they're doing."
""
"Overall a tasty beer. So bitter. Wouldn't drink a ton of it but it's a good beer for sure"
""
""
""
"This beer is bitter, the finish isn't too dry but it is quite bitter. Mildly dry I suppose, medium in body to start out with, beer is chewy with resinous hops, nice throughout, if you like your IPAs big and hoppy, this is a good one."
"D: i have to disagree with the name of this beer. my palate is not wreaked. it is happy. very happy. super hoppy brew is not overwhelmed with a massive malt body. to be honest, i couldnt even detect much malt at all. hard to believe this is 9.5%abv. really tasty stuff from green flash."

"O: An excellent, well made, easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is as aggressive as the phrase """Palate Wrecker""" suggests. I appreciate aggressive hops, but this is borderline ridiculous. That being said, this is a must-try."
"Solid Double IPA but doesn't really hit me as a great one. I don't wanna call it one dimensional but it just doesn't drink as nicely as others."
""
""
"O: I was really surprised at how good this beer was. Green Flash WC IPA is a really good beer, but I have had some dogs from them (Barleywine for the worst example). This beer is upper tier for DIPAs -- intense, complex, hops-forward, with huge aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
"Still regard Green Flash as one of the most underrated breweries in the country. They were not messing around with this beer."
""
"O- Guess I am missing something on this one, based on others reviews. Maybe it wasn't stored correctly. No date on bottle, so no idea regarding freshness."
""
""
""
"Overall, another great hoppy beer from Green Flash; go figure."
"Off-the-chain excellence here from what I still think is the best brewery in the U.S. And if not the best, they're at least the most consistently excellent at what they do. I'd like to see Green Flash expand their style boundaries just a tad more, but still, they're kicking ass like crazy, every single time. Hell yeah."
""
""
"T: Tons of hops here. A big growing pine hop bite with a lingering bitterness throughout. A slight hint of biscuity malt in the background, but the balance is definitely not quite there. Finish leaves some dry and bitter aspirin flavors on the tongue, which I wasn't crazy about. A hop monster, but the flavors are a tad off. A good DIPA, but not fantastic."
"O - This is a beer whose name is not false advertising. It is one hoppy beer that really beings along the pine and bitter flavors. Nice to see a DIPA that doubles the hops instead of loading up on sweet malts. Reminds me of a West Coast version of Furious but with a thinner body."
"O - I like this beer for what it is, but I wouldn't seek it out often. I love the bitterness, and could even deal with much more, but I like hop bitterness to come with hop flavor. I know it's possible, but it's clearly not the easiest thing to pull off. Props for making a beer like this. All too often I don't get enough bitterness from (D)IPAs, but this was nice. If you like bitter beers, search this out. If you don't, don't."
"Close your eyes and you are in San Diego, enjoying a fine example of the local nectar. Well done and worth the price of admission."
"I really just couldn't get into this one."
"You've been warned."
"Very fresh bottle...pretty sure this was released on March 12th...So bout 9 days old. Pours an almost clear, copper color with a large white head that takes some time to diminish. Scent is very fresh with intense hoppiness and some lovely grapefruit character. Hints of mango and pineapple as well. Very little malt characteristics, as the nose would lead. Taste is initially sweet citrus flavors with just a bit of malt...but that doesn't last very long. You immediately get slapped in the face with intense bitterness and grapefruit. This beer definitely has a lingering bitter finish. Nice blend of tropical and citrus fruits with an immense amount of pine and a bit of earthy flavors. I wonder how long it will take before this lingering bitterness on the back of my tongue goes away. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky with a bit of crispness...more sticky though. Drinkability is high...if you can handle the bitterness."
"$11.95 for a 4 pack. One of my favorites right now. Much like Stones Ruination but takes it to a whole different level. I've read it compares to Hopslam but haven't had the slam, so I can't compare the 2. If you enjoy anything with hops, procure this brew as soon as possible. Lives up to its name to, gotta love it..."
"well... its decent. not worth the cost for me, though. kind of falls between an IIPA and a barleywine, but there are many examples of both styles I enjoy more."
""
"Overall, this beer is fantastic, I noticed as it warmed up, it got better and better, I would have one of these a day. Anyone who is a hop head needs to add this to their must try."
""
""
"NOT A SESSION BEER!!!"
"A great beer for the right occassion -- not a beer I will always want, but one I'll definitely seek out for a special occassion and a great way to end the night."
"Flavor is hugely hoppy, powerfully bitter, bursting with citrus notes. Again, grapefruit and pineapples, pine and resins, very, very little malt presence or sweetness. All hops. Not balanced at all, an over-the-top west coast DIPA. Body is medium to a little thin for the style, but mouthfeel is good, with some stickiness, smooth carbonation. Long lingering bitter aftertaste. Every hophead should try this one for sure, definitely a standout in a crowded field. Preferred the hop combination in this to the GF IIPA. The name is no joke and it was hard to taste another beer clearly after this one."
""
"O - Very very nice aggressive west coast ipa, discovered green flash about a week ago when they started distributing down here and they are now probably a personal top 5-10 brewery for me. love it."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Very clear hop profile in the nose and taste. Southern California is the land of """palate wreckers", so this does not stand up to the stated style. It would make for a great IPA, but not an imperial or double."
""
"Really a chore drinking this beer down given the blend of pine, sweetness and noticeable alcohol. Have to say I much prefer the regular DIPA from these guys."
""
"o - overall, this is kind of what i expected...actually, i expected bitter for the sake of bitter, like 1000 ibu. nice double ipa, but finishes with huge bitterness, not really one to start your night, great one to finish with. good, not great."
""
""
"Overall this beer does live up to its name it IS a Palette Wrecker. A DIPA on the dry and bitter end of the spectrum."
""
"A tasty beer that will please hop heads. Maybe it's my palate but I didn't think this beer was a hop bomb. Hides the 9% abv very well."
""
"O - this a just what I was looking for in a DIPA. Big bold hoppy character, with the alcohol very well hidden. There is NO indication that this a 9.5%. A great brew that I would definitely have again."
"Overall: Unbalanced in the best possible way. So much hop aggression it's almost comical at times. The pithy bitterness reminds me of FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf, and that's good company."
"Overall: This is a huge DIPA. A true palate wrecker. Not an everyday beer, but a serious hop bomb for when you're in the mood. Nearly perfect."
"O/D-First off, I must say I only bought a single bottle (12 oz.). The single was over $4 and a 4-pack clocks in at about $15. That is quite a ridiculous price. Regardless, this beer is extremely delicious. This is my style of DIPA. I do not know if I enjoy this than their West Coast IPA, but this is unquestionably one of the better DIPAs I have had is quite a while. Shockingly citrusy."
"Good to see a new Green Flash offering here in the Triad.Poured into a tulip glass nice deep burnt orange with a well defined sticky one finger white head that left multiple globs of lace as it settled slowly into a frothy mass.Sharp grapefruit hops at the onset as soon as I opened the bottle along with some booze but it's not overly sweet,just smells sticky and good.Raw hop goodness on the palate with sharp grapefruit rind and herbal notes,mild caramel sweetness underneath cant hold up to the sharp bitter hop onslaught,and amazingly the sweetness is held in check well.This is what a DIPA should be a hop explosian not a sugary sweet malt bomb,I loved it hence the perfect taste score.Best beer I have had in 2012."
"O- a very complex dipa, and again it is not too sweet, like some dipas can be, almost reminds me of a more drinkable founders devil dancer, an intense brew, appropriately named, of you arent looking for a hop bomb then stay away from this one.... Thank you Green Flash, for yet another world class brew"
""
"Drink- A good solid DIPA put on cask. Nice balance and was good but wasn't great."
""
""
"O: You need to have a heavy tolerance for hops in order to finish this beer because it isn’t that balanced."
""

"Probably my favorite brew from Green Flash and so glad to see this out again. A big DIPA that I would put up there against the best of them including Alpine's Bad Boy."
"I had this on cask at Pizza Port in Carlsbad yesterday and took notes. The smell is herbal, slightly spicy hops. The color is bright, clear copper in the glass with just a small bubbly head. The mouthfeel is so smooth and soft! The taste is woody and hoppy with a semi-sweet grainy malt in back. If there is such a thing as a non-sweet honey taste, I'd attribute that to this beer. It has a lovely apricot finish, too. I wish I could go back today for another round."
"Decent beer, but would have better if the hop profile was a little more balanced in the flavor."
"Overall- a good brew and the name does as it says. Very good. DIPA"
"A hoppy, strong, bitter DIPA. A signature Green Flash brew."
"A solid brew, but I'm content with just the 5 oz pour I had."
"Overall - This really didn't wreck my palate to be honest. I wish it was a hint colder...the room temperature hurt this beer in my opinion. An interesting beer but nothing special or something I'd seek out in the future."
"d - A pretty good DIPA. Lots of nice citrus hops and not too bitter. Would have again."
"D - This beer is pretty drinkable. I could definitely have one or two but after that it would be time to move on."
"Definitely did not wreck my palate."
"Another double IPA from Green Flash, and although I was unimpressed with their bottled imperial IPA, I was eager to give this one a shot (mainly based on my love for the IPA and red). Again, I was disappointed. Poured a fairly clear orange-amber color, with a fairly solid white head. Big hoppy nose (shock!)--grapefruit, orange zest, weed leads to a body that is similarly overrun with hops, along with a little malt, apparently in an effort to keep this one balanced. Like with the IIPA, it doesn't work. For whatever reason, Green Flash's IIPAs just don't work for me, although I generally love the style as well as pretty much everything else Green Flash brews."
"Palate Wrecker almost lives up to it's name, but even after I finished it I could still sense that the malt was weak. Good? Bad? Meh, you be the judge of that. For me it was nice, but would like to see more malt to counter the hops as they strive for Lemon Pine Sol level. This might be very good with spicy dishes, if you like spice and pain. Otherwise it would be a bit tough to drink."
"This beer isn't for everybody, but it has a bold, assertive, and focused taste that makes one think that the makers really knew what they were aiming for."
"Good. Probably best green flash beer I can think of. Nice bubbly mouthfeel to lighten it up."
"This is one really well made DIPA. I'm going to eat something before having another though. One of the better DIPA's I've had in a while."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, with little to no carbonation, a light crisp feel and a very smooth feel overall. I guess it was balanced, but it's hard to judge since this was a hop assault and just a very tasty beer that any hop-head will enjoy. The 9% ABV was well hidden and this beer went down very easy. A definite recommendation."
"Drinkability: I could drink this beer all day, excellent beer, I highly recommend."
"I've since had bottles of this, it seems to go back and forth descriptor wise between a barleywine and a dipa. I prefer it fresh, and subsequent batches (like even the Toronado BW fest) have been heavier malt wise at times, but then the last one was lighter and more dipa tropical fruit edges to it. Either way, drink asap on the first one to decide where you want it to go from there. Good with or without age."
"Overall a superior hop bomb."
"Not my kinda brew but seems well elaborate so i won't flunk it. someone out there must love it i have no doubt."
"Overall I feel this was a nice attempt in the DIPA field and would be definitely worthy for bottling. Another well done brew from the Green Flash crew."
"D: One of the better IPAs I've had in awhile. The typical flavors you expect from a Green Flash IPA and it definitely lives up to the name. Just watch out for this one because it packs a punch."
"I had this over a year ago at the Toronado in SF and rememeber it being bitter as hell. This pint definitely confirmed what I had remembered. It worked very well on cask and is worth seeking out if you love hops assaulting your palate."
"The name is befitting, as this beer is bitter as hell. It attacks my palate with fury and malice. The bitterness has a nice backing of hop flavor with resiny pine and grapefruit. A low level of caramel sweetness is evident, but it doesn't approach balancing. The finish is dry and very, very bitter with noticeable alcohol lingering line. The mouthfeel is dry and sticky. A damn fine and very bitter double IPA. This is a veritable palate wrecker."
"Wondering how this is normally when not on cask"
"Overall, this remains with you for quite some time..."
"Very long pine resin/grapefruit skin finish. Super drinkable. This is Le Freak with more character and balance; Le Freak """kicked up a notch!""""
"This years batch weighs in at 10.0% I believe."
"Poured a medium amber color with a small sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, floral hops, and pine. Tastes of the same citrus, pine and a lighter maltiness. Nicely bitter."
"Umm, wow. Pours hazy orange-gold with an impressive short-but-thick white head. Colossal citrus/floral hop aroma. Grapefruit and pine oil just pound you in the face. The taste surpasses the nose. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and truckloads of resin. A tad more citrus than earthy pine, but who cares. Just a little caramel malt to give it a hint of sweetness. I really have to thank the Green Flash guys for not making the chronic mistake of putting too much malt in and making this a sour-candy DIPA. Its nearly perfect the way it is."
"Holy shit! God, Green Flash loves its hops. The Palate Wrecker was poured from a gravity cask. It is hazy amber-orange color with no head (obviously because of the cask). Nevertheless, the color profile is phenomenal. The smells is intensely and absurdly of wonderfully fruity hops. The taste is the same. It is right in your face hops. Incredible! The taste also has a strong malty-sweet balance to it. Just amazing. Lots of grapefruit and orange...kind of resin-y. This beer really does wreck your palate. If you are lucky enough to come across it get it. It's awesome."
"Sent from my iPhone 3G"
"D: Another real good beer from Green Flash, I'd definitely have it again, but I'd make sure to make it my last beer of the day."
"Very heavy beer. I could drink one pint but after that it would seem like a chore. Feels like a meal to drink."
