The aroma is of malts, red grapefruit and pine. More going on with the taste as you can taste the pale malts, floral and earthy hops along with some citrus zest. Has a good taste with a slight bitter finish but really doesn't last a long time. Medium-bodied and carbonation. Wasn't sure on this one but turned out ok overall.","BeerWithMike","Dec 08, 2014"

Smell is of candied orange, grapefruit, lemon, and cake like sweetness.  Taste is hop forward, soft cake like malt backbone from the wheat works it's way in and out with flavors of citrus and tropical fruit in the form of orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango.  Medium body doesn't show the heft of the ABV, sharp carbonation breaks into a more creamy and coating feel on the finish.  Overall this is a great DIPA which uses light malt flavors and showcases some really fruity hops.","HopBomb515","0"

The hop profile through the aroma is nearly spot-on, but the beer is made more serious by heavier booze, harsher metallics, and more bittered grain.  The nose is much more exciting than the flavor, which falls more heavily to the aforementioned notes, boxing out the base a bit.  That said, this is an easy drinking, hearty beverage that is perfectly aligned with the rest of the “Sumpin’” series.  It is obviously most comparable to the standard Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’, but again, does feel like a hybrid between that far off original and their latest hit of Sucks.  It may take you to the end of the first bottle to really get into this one, as it did with us, but fear not, because that alluring Lagunitas mystique will surely pull you back in, making it hard for you to not chain-drink the entire pack.","TheBrewo","Sep 29, 2014"

I love my Heady Topper but this beer has to be world class. The right word is balanced. It is aromatic, makes you want more with the complexities with the hoppy, citrusy, floral cornucopia  yet is a smooth companion.

Today, I went to one of my local beer shops and picked up a 6 pack of this on a whim. $10.99 for a DIPA? I'm in. Poured into my Speigelau IPA glass. Golden yellow like a wheat (technically it is a wheat). Nice thick white head. Smells amazing. Citrusy, fruity, some malt sweetness. Taste is tropical fruit and citrus. A lot of orange, grapefruit, and mango. The wheat and malt balance well with the hops. IBU is in the 60s which is pretty low for a DIPA but it works out so well. I give it a perfect 5 for mouthfeel because I honestly wouldn't change anything. The fact that this is 8.5% and tastes so sessionable is unbelievable to me. It's not sticky or anything. Very light. Lagunitas can do no wrong. Another amazing brew from them.","MisSigsFan","Sep 19, 2014"

The Extra poured a deep golden with a lush white head. The taste exploded with fresh hops that were straight up citrus and tropical fruit. The more I drank it the more I detected apricot tones as well. It was a huge juicy and fruity hop monster that doesn't wear down your palate with bitterness but more of a sweet and fruity bite that is both well rounded and refreshing. What an exceptional beer and another well done IPA from Lagunitas.","brurevu","Sep 10, 2014"

4.24,0,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light to medium coppery amber with a half finger white head that dissipates to a thick cap with good retention and lacing. Aroma of mild caramel malt, citrus and dank hops, tropical fruit and a spicy slightly sour component resembling rye. Flavor follows with a nice mildly caramel malt, citrus, piney and somewhat dank hops, tropical and citrus fruit, finishing with citrus rind and herbal hop bitterness. Medium bodied with hints of creaminess. A nicely balanced, flavorful IPA, as I expect from Lagunitas. Not as mouth numbing as some of their other hop bombs, but the great melding of a pleasant malt base with interesting hops flavors works quite well. Rarely disappointed by this brewery, and this one is excellent.","LiquidAmber","Beers"

Sharp pineapple aroma with orange zest, honey and sugary malt. Medium bodied with a slick oily feel up front followed by a light, tangy rush of carbonation. Sugary sweet malt and intense pineapple flavors up front and through the middle. Pineapple flavors transition to tangy, biting herbal hops to the end. Finished with a lingering pine hop bitterness.

4.32,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/22/2014. Pours crystal clear bright gold color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 15, 2014"

The color of dark apple juice, orange-yellow amber with an imposing (four inch or so) frothy beige head, the bigger brother (sister?) of Little Sumpin' features the expected hop-forward nose, tons of grapefruit, tangerine, and lime rinds buttressed by gummy candy malts and a slightly tart wheaty spice. Certainly resembles Little Sumpin' in its barely restrained hoppy power, an assertive yet well-rounded pine note, the aforementioned citrus rinds and juice, white pepper, musky pineapples, mangoes, and guavas, maybe a whiff of lychee or longan fruit perfume. Glorious, powerful but not coarse, showy but with considerable substance. Sweeter than its little bro, less dry and bitter although the semi-dry finish certainly features a decent dose of resinous bitters and pine needles. Sweet malts and very juicy hops like Sucks, but more compact, dare I draw this comparison? Quite thick and protrudes on the palate, although I find the moderate to high carbonation provides a foil that saves this from being too soupy. Perhaps the sweetness subsides a little over the course of a bottle, as the wheat spice and more medicinal aspects of the hops take over. Alcohol faintly perceptible and what's there adds to the experience. Probably my favorite wheat DIPA and yet another Lagunitas triumph.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 04, 2014"
4.51,6.4,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Final Thoughts: One of the best beers I've had in a long time and it's no surprise that it comes from Lagunitas. While not quite in the same vane as Sucks, Little Sumpin' Extra! is a great DIPA in its own right and nicely built off of the standard that is Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. Would I drink it again? Yes, at about $10 a sixer it's a steal.","JamesMN","Aug 04, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet citrus fruit, citrus zest, and citrus juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic citrus forward hop qualities that make this one very tasty and super easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"

I smell a lot tropical fruit, pineapple, mango and pine resin right up front with notes of caramel and floral gardens. I love it. Super complex flavors that change with every second. It's very sweet and caramel for a brief moment before you get smacked with huge notes of orange peel, green pineapple that becomes more and more resinous, then the mid-palate becomes super spicy and caramelly sweet, before finishing and lingering long on orange peel flavors. This is a very exciting beer! I plan to grab more while it lasts.","droomyster","Aug 01, 2014"

It has a great hop character with a lot of grapefruit flavor up front from the hops.  The beer pours well and retained its head all the way to the bottom of the glass.  I like this beer, but without comparing them side by side, I can't see the big difference between the regular Sumpin Sumpin and the extra.  That's not to say that there isn't a difference, but it didn't jump out at me.  That said, I'd drink it again (and again)","lobotomy","Aug 01, 2014"

This has a clear, golden hue with some quickly disappearing finger of white head. While this didn't explode on the nose, there were some nice, subtle aromas of astringent pine (one of my favorites), and a clean, bright citrus fragrance. The tastes were lemony, fresh, and bright... with a nice piney contribution. Really crisp and refreshing (same refreshing palate brought to mind by DirtWolf). Bit oily on the mouthfeel, but expected in a big IPA style. This was a very nice, easy drinking Imperial. I'd highly recommend giving it a try.","Mikus","Jul 28, 2014"

Excellent beer at an excellent price while supplies last!","MarkGamber","Jul 23, 2014"

The aroma is mild, but with nice distinct notes of pine and fruit. The taste is close to the smell but just amplified. It has great blending of the hops components (citrus, pine, floral) and a great malt backbone to stand up to it. The body is just right, not too heavy but not watery, either. A great Imperial IPA.","delta490","Jul 23, 2014"

Nose is sugar cookie. Sweet little malt and lots of citrus. Lemon peel, soft ripe orange underneath and a hop spice that is a bit ticklish to the nose. Drinks sweetly and softly with a creamy mouthfeel. Ample carbonation that lightens the drink but does not bite. The fruits combine in this one for a punch like quality and the tangy hop spice causes the illusion of pineapple. No alcohol in the drink and this one finishes dry and with a solid bitter that does strip the palate. There is a bit of sticky resin to coat the throat in the end and that brings the fruit flavors forward once more and a lets a taste of honey from the malt be realized before it's done.","utopiajane","0"

4.16,-1.9,4,4.25,4.25,4,4,"Excellent little sumpin' extra. The extra is more hops. As a fan of the standard (and this coming from a stout and Belgian drinker) it is a wonderfully balanced ale. Pours a lustrous amber yellow with thick off white foam and amazing cling to the side of the glass lacing. Smells of grapefruit and heavy citrusy oranges and lemons with a sweet malt background. Taste is excellent with citrus hops up front---grapefruit, oranges, lemon zest, and with a balanced sweet background and decent carbonation to make it very satisfying. Aftertaste is citrus laced bittering hops that hangs with you. While NOT a hop head, I like this beast, although Little Sumpin' Sumpin' is still in my opinion a more balanced ale, this is a close second. I enjoy it more with each sip and find myself editing the review as I go...THAT is a world class beer in my humble opinion. Cheers.","Brutaltruth","Jul 07, 2014"

As with its more diminutive counterpart, the wheat is somewhat downplayed in taste (but not body) as the hops are the focus. Bitterness is tame, but not flavor. This is brimming with enticing tropical hop taste. But for a good dose of alcohol warmth, it drinks much the same as Sumpin' Sumpin' too. I think I still prefer Sumpin' Sumpin', but this will not disappoint by any means.","ryan1788a5","Jul 05, 2014"

I've wanted to try this one for a long time, and find it to be a well above average west coast ipa. i like that the grain gives body without a ton of weighty sugary flavor. its dynamic and exciting and the perfect big ipa for hot weather. how fantastic!","StonedTrippin","Jul 04, 2014"

4.03,-5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The pour was very nice, rich amber in color with a huge cascading white head that just would not quite no matter what. Really nicely done I have to admit. Even after a few minutes it was still going strong with rich lacing up and down the sides of the glass. Aroma was a hop bomb, cirus filling the air from the first moment and really giving you a nose full. Even warming could not cut through the grapefruit and biting sharp hop notes. Nice medium body was well carbonated and allowed the flavor to really absorb along the palate. First taste is sharp, huge notes of sticky pine and grapefruit rip the tongue but mellow out a bit behind a biscuit like mi palate. Some nice notes of grain plugging through in here I have to say before a smack of hops dries the palate and leaves a bit of a hot boozy note on its way down.","mikesgroove","Jan 18, 2011"

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Good solid DIPA that is full of citrus and pine notes with a thick mouthfeel almost chewy which works for the flavour profile.

A very solid double ipa but I prefer hop bombs. While there is a lot of nice grapefruit bitterness there is an overwhelming syrupy sweetness to it. The individual components could have been a bit tighter. I'm knit picking here but at this stage in the game I expect a lot from a double ipa to bring it to that A,A+ level.

It pours a moderate sized head, a touch tingly on the tongue, oweing mostly to the high ABV.

Hoptastic taste with grapefruit in the forefront and a slight maltiness to even it out. Nicely done. High carbonation makes it a little rough on the swallow.

This beer pours a reddish amber with a massive 3 inch creamy head that leaves a curtain of lacing down the sides of the glass. Maybe because it's a amped up version of a Pale Ale instead of an IPA, the main aroma component is toffee and other sweet malts. Hops are present with orange and lemon peel, a bit of sweet mango but really the malt backbone is the basis of this beer. Its sweet and the hops really take a back seat. Bready malts with toffee and caramel, a bit of brown sugar, make up the front of the flavor profile. The hops come through on the middle with mango and pineapple. The citrus is rather subdued and definitely no pine. The mouthfeel is full and creamy leaving a lingering bitterness on the palate. Over all, I think I'll spend my $3.99 on a Hop Stoopid.

Don't get the wrong idea though; this value isn't remarkable just because it's 9%~ beer for $3/22oz. It's remarkable because Lagunitas makes high quality beer.

The smell is of a strong hop aroma with an odd cinnimon or nutmeg smell to it. Very interesting. The taste is rather interesting as well. There is the common hop bite up front, not to terribly strong. But it's the back of the pallate that takes a left turn. I can't quite put a word to what happens except that there's like a powdered sugar feeling to the after taste. Very interesting. The powder feel makes the mouthfeel rather dry, another oddity. All these strange characteristics are not bad, and take nothing away from the beer. They just prove there's other ways to make a IIPA even more interesting and better.

The taste is a hop bomb. Lots of tasty hoppiness hits immediately, then gives way to the bitter citrus. Not a whole lot of balance here, but it's quite tasty.

Not really too bitter, more of a decent mix between bitter and sweet. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy, and some notes of alcohol make their way through. I had no issue clearing off the bottle, however I am not sure I would get it again. Final thoughts are that this beer is pretty good, although not nearly as much as the Martys staff said. I was not the least bit impressed by the Lil Sumpin Sumpin available in six packs. This is an improvement, but still nothing to go hunting down. I am more of a fan of the Hop Stoopid.

The aroma has a touch of alcohol as its only very slight downside. Otherwise, it's bright and fruity with hops. It smells like mangoes, raspberries and lemons. There's a caramel malt note in there, but it's buried beneath handfuls of hops. The flavor is dry, not quite Pliny-level dry but still excellent. The grain tastes fresh and clean and contributes just the right amount of sweetness. I imagine this beer has some wheat in it, like its little brother, but it's not very noticeable except at the first moment of flavor and possibly a touch in the aroma, just a whiff of bread. I'm really trying to find it, though. Anyway, the hops are the star. They're big, bright and fruity. There's a touch of pine resin in the flavor, but it's still mostly tropical fruits and berries.

The nose is drenched in pink grapefruit, lime and tangerine juice, pungently sweet with pine oil, scone crumbs, the apricot, peach fruit too friendly to relent and take on tart pineapple notes, difficult to tease out any chocolate or toffee type stuff. Full-bodied, the carbonation is fine and sticks the tongue rather than swirl, this in large part due to the overt heaviness and tactile cling. Not as out-and-out sweet as the nose, however, there's no less impressiveness in the tangerine, lime, pink grapefruit, just the dominance among them shifted a bit. Pine, ginger and more of a floral dimension although that is too delicate to thrive amidst the bitter grassiness which comes to the fore at the end. Powdered milk chocolate has additional staying power and there's a punch of carob as well. Not that much breadiness, if anything rough baker's dough. Apricot, nectarine, golden raisin, honeydew melon fruit flavors.

4.64,9.4,4,5,4.5,4,5,"A clear gold colored body was attractive, and the head atop was modest but stable. Carbonation appeared relatively light. The smell was a hop symphony that was bold and beautiful. Some caramel malt smell was poking through under the strong hop presence. The taste was citric grapefruit pith and bitter herbs with a honey-pineapple like sweetness backing it up. This was definitely a wet dream for a hophead like me. Unabashed DIPA goodness abounded in each sip, with the bitter finish taking no prisoners. This is what Maximus should have been all along. Felt a bit runny in the mouth with not much coating action, but that led naturally to more drinking. Drinkability off the charts for any hop lover.","rajendra82","Sep 21, 2009"

A little less strong and less hoppy than some of their others so it can be drank in somewhat larger quanties, at somewhat earlier hours and can be shared with the less adventurous.

Lots of tangy citrus and resinous pine on the front, followed by the aforementioned tropical fruits that get a dose of sweetness from the malts on the finish. Just the right amount of bitterness, but the hop flavor is where it's at with this IIPA. Mouthfeel is no slouch, either, with a medium body packing a tight, bubbly carbonation level. Not too syrupy or heavy on the palate, just the way I like 'em. Great job on the Little Sumpin' lineup, Lagunitas...two-for-two in my book!","wagenvolks","Beers"

The hop aroma is nice with floral, fruity and piney notes but it might be a bit reserved compared to some other DIPAs in its area. The flavor is very nice with some citrusy hop flavor at the start and an increasing citrusy bitterness through the finish. It takes quite some time for it to die down; even after your mouth is empty. The 8.74% alcohol remains well hidden throughout the experience. The mouthfeel is creamy and silky though maybe a bit thin with a low to moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles. There's some decent lacing left behind. This is a nice beer with lots of character.","GJ40","Sep 13, 2009"

The smell is pure Lagunitas IPA, the IPA's from this brewery are so solid. The hops display soft grapefruit aromas and a little orange, near perfect for a west coast DIPA. It tastes a little burning, fresh resin squeezed right from the cones. I get a strong pungent citrus bite with each sip, overwhelmingly good. This is what a DIPA should be, you can tell that there's extra malt based on body but the balance is appropriately hop-centric. Wow this is good stuff.","TurdFurgison","Sep 13, 2009"

4,-5.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Very nice beer, but it is a little hot and not quite as good as a Lil Sumpin Sumpin. I'm not really sure why this beer was necessary given that the regular version was already over 7% abv. The extra alcohol just detracts in my opinion- bring back Lil Sumpin Sumpin! In any case, this is still quite good. Pours dark golden with a thin white head and very nice lacing. Tangy smell of yeast and wheat with some tropical fruits and alcohol. Tastes somewhat similar, but with a deeeper and longer flavor than suggested in the nose, and a long bitterness as well to balance the tropical fruit. Moderately sweet, somewhat tangy, bitter finish, and alcohol throughout. Big beer and not all that smooth, but quite bitter and with less alcohol very refreshing. As is, there is a nice crisp bitterness. Quite good, but sometimes less is more. Lil Sumpin Sumpin was one of my favorite beers of summer.","Georgiabeer","Sep 11, 2009"
