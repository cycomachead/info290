Aromas are fresh hops, fresh baked bread, malt, a little fruit. Flavor's are similar to nose, perfect balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Excellent body. Slight medicinal aftertaste from hop.

3.84,-9,4,4.25,3.5,3.75,4,"The beer is ever so slightly cloudy, making one think of lemon juice. The head is relatively high and strikingly white. It recedes slowly, with minimal lacing, but the beer nonetheless appears viscous on the glass. There's an aroma full of the promise of grapefruit; so...here's hoping. But, alas, the expectation of a citrus bomb goes unrequited. What we have here is an anonymous, restrained bitterness. It has a certain piquancy, and it goes down well, but the aromatic volatility of essence of grapefruit rind that one sometimes longs for in a high-powered IPA is missing. The beer's texture is nonetheless satisfyingly rich. It's a good beer, but didn't meet my (perhaps eccentric) citric expectations.","Altrurian","Mar 17, 2015"

I appreciate single malt ipa's a lot being a complete hop head. the light pilsner malt should showcase the hops but the bitterness and the alcohol just throws a shadow over the hoppy taste which is a bummer.  if you're a brewer this beer is spot on from the description on ingredients from their website. I wish they threw more mosaic for flavor and aroma,  not being a huge fan of the hipster (tropical) hops (pineapple, mango, lemon) and more from the classic( grapefruit and pine) this one isn't for me.","claminat420","Mar 09, 2015"

3.74,-11.4,3.75,4,3.5,4,3.75,"My local bottle shop was trying to move these, so had them priced the same as Dirtwolf, one of my favorite Double IPAs. It's a great beer, but I can't help feeling that it's inferior to Dirtwolf and a touch redundant. I mean, this is a DIPA at 9% and Dirtwolf is 8.7 I think. It's a little sweet for my liking, but is ingenious for a midwinter release in the Northeast. On the whole, I don't think it stands out too much among Victory's world class offerings, and lacks that extra something/ punch I hoped for.","DagenhamDavis","Mar 05, 2015"

4.4,4.3,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"So how to rate this beer?  It delivers everything that an "Imperial" IPA should, sans the bitter punch and late raspy/resinous finish, the alcohol slap, and the overall palate-wrecking voluminosity. There are no defects of any sort (although I would like to see just a little more bristle in the mouthfeel), and in fact it's a really well-rounded and highly polished beer. What's not to love? But on top of that it's also quite unique, and innovative. Clearly a winner, and one that really needs to be sampled, any fan of hoppy beers needs to check it out!","NeroFiddled","Mar 03, 2015"

The aroma was sweet and juicy tropical fruits with some grassy almost pilsner qualities.  The flavor is where the Hop Ranch takes over your palate.  Bursting with big beautiful tropical fruits on the front end thanks to the Mosaic hops this is a beast out of the gate.  The flavor slowly evolves into a floral earthy sharpness that mimics a Pilsner on the back end and coats your tongue with a wonderful bitterness. The tropical fruitiness of this brew made it for me and while I was quickly downing my glass I realized how well the abv was hidden.  A great beer from top to bottom.","brurevu","Feb 11, 2015"

On the tongue, it's thinnish and well carbonated, but has an oily quality that's kind of cool. Finish is both sweet and bitter. I'm a fan of doubles that aren't all malt-clunky to counter the hops.

It has a complementary carbonation level, it tickles your mouth enough without being over carbonated.  Nice light feel without much of a bite from the carbonation or the alcohol.  I mentioned before it's sort of like hop juice, but it's such an amazing combination of what's going on just from the hops, goes sweet than leads to a a dry bitter finish, very clean.  Crazy drinkable beer, especially for the style, would prefer it in the summer though.  Great beer, another good beer from Victory.

The combo of floral and tropical (some have noted citrus, I didn't get that in my taste) is very well blended and makes a great hop forward flavor combo.

Did not get the big citrus, etc that the description/other reviewers got at all. Maybe a hint on the nose and the palate, but the dominant aromas in my opinion were of the earthy/resiny variety. I got a really dank (almost cheesy; in a good way) note on the nose that overpowered anything in the 'citrus' spectrum. There was a distinct bitterness on the nose (not unlike DirtWolf) where with a big deep huff you can actually feel it in your eyes (if you have tried this, you know what I mean). Huge up-front bitterness on the palate, with lots of nice, dank goodness, pine actually came through on the back of the palate. This was not a usual (fruit juice) IIPA for me, and that is actually something I like. Light mouthfeel for a pretty big beer. No noticeable alcohol burn, etc. Hint of an oily, lingering quality of the mouthfeel that allowed the flavors to hang around for a few moments (pine dominated here, though the resiny notes were around too). This beer made me think. I thought about hops (and all of the characteristics that different varieties bring to the party), I thought about my palate (and why some reviewers are getting different aromas/flavors dominating), and I thought about why I enjoy tasting and reviewing beers so much. I don't often get that with a standard profile IIPA. Victory consistently makes me think about what I am tasting. Not too many other breweries can do that (Upper Hand also comes to mind). Cheers BAs! UPDATE: This was very different on draft. DID get tons of big citrus and tropical notes... nice, dry finish with juiciness throughout. Easily a 4 all-around on draft.","Mikus","Jan 31, 2015"

Nose is a bit subdued - citrus peel and some light earthy/herbal aromatics with a hint of tangerine towards the back.  Taste consistent with nose.  I'm really not all that blown away by the flavor profile - a bit on the simple side.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation just shy of prickly and a light acidity that stimulates the back of the tongue.  Overall, decent but nothing to write home about.

There is some small pieces of junk in the bottom of my glass - I presume this is an unfiltered beer which is cool. Smells great - lots of juicy tropical fruits such as grapefruit, pineapple and orange. Taste is complex, dank and bright all at the same time with earthy pine, orange and grapefruit flavors. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer that has a lively, fresh taste to it that keeps you coming back for more. Highly recommended.","bound4er","Jan 23, 2015"

This beer manages to balance fruity, tropical hop notes with more earthy hop notes (without giving me the onion flavor that I have noticed in other Victory beers), all the while balancing the hops against the malt bill very nicely.

3.36,-20.4,4,3,3.25,4,3.5,"Very fresh bottle that just missed the mark entirely. Aroma was all over the place, none of it a good place though. Almost sour malt, the hop combo just not pleasant at all, partly for its weakness as much as its poor accord. Palate wasn't much better, some astringent hoppiness, extremely little actual hop flavor, overly full malt feel. Bad batch? Perhaps, as freshness wasn't an issue. Needless to say, highly doubt I'll revisit.","breadwinner","Jan 11, 2015"

Normal head volume, lacing and slightly below normal retention.  Nice nose of sweet blended tropical fruit over a light orange rind note.  Light medium body with a good bit of oiliness to the texture. Well carbonated with a good effervescence in the middle and more in the finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense (hop flavor forward), extremely well balanced and complex.  It begins with an effervescent burst of blended hop flavor (tropicals such as mango, pineapple, but never really separates).  This flows into a moderate bitterness in the middle that contains a slight pepper note.  As the bitterness fades, a biscuit sweetness emerges with hints of orange.  The finish is a slow fade into a lingering orange zest flavor bitterness and a slight nice alcohol warming at the back of the throat.","tillmac62","Jan 04, 2015"

There's some sediment floating throughout, too. Aromas of dank and pungent hops, wet and heavy, with grassy notes, heavy cedar notes, moss, clove and pepper spicing, and a hint of rich apricot sweetness. Very unique nose for the style. Flavors are smooth and balanced forward, with a solid toffee and biscuit backbone supporting a mild bitterness in the background, a heavy dose of wood, moss, and pitch in the forefront, and highlights of citrus fruit and spices. Very heavy and very different. Wow. The body is smooth, and kept very light by the carbonation levels. The aftertaste is surprisingly light, with more of the tart citrus and fruity sweetness coming through, and only hints of grass and forest characteristics. The finish is smooth, light, and slightly crisp, with a hint of dryness across the palate. Heavy, but damn tasty. This is a good beer.","GarthDanielson","Feb 18, 2014"

It won't be for everyone - disagree completely with any comparison to Hopslam - I know a Michigan Bell's fan that would kill for Hopslam that hates this beer. After producing Dirtwolf - Victory went in a completely 180 degree opposite direction - love it as a contrast to the orange color hop dominated IPAs which I also love.","daschule","Feb 13, 2014"

4.46,5.7,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5/5): Hop Ranch is an excellent Imperial/Double IPA, that has a lot of great characteristics–the nose is full of citrus and tropical fruit notes, the taste, full of orange, peach, and pineapple-like hop character, and the finish is pleasantly drying. There's a nice sweetness that balances out the initial astringence and makes it quite a pleasure to drink. I think it's a distinct beer, and have enjoyed it more than Victory's other, very successful big IPA, DirtWolf. Definitely a great beer that shows off the unique hop characteristics of Azacca and Mosaic.","hagbergl","Jan 31, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of citrus/tropical hops and a light-moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big mango, peach, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, pine, light honey, and floral earthiness. Good amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, white grape, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops with light-moderate malt balance; with a nice crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA. Great complexity of bright hop flavors with a light-moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 27, 2014"

4.2,-0.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, the best thing about this beer is really a tossup between its aroma and its flavoring. The nose is fresh and full of that glorious mosaic fruitiness, but it mixes with this down-to-earth grit that makes it memorable. The sip, on the other hand, gives you this explosive yet tamable flavoring that again, showcases the uniqueness of the hops, but also shows how interesting you can make the base of the beer as well. Having tried both the R and the S tester batches of this beer over the past couple years it has been interesting watching and being present for this final product’s genesis. While they are each different recipes, they demonstrate the type of heartiness that can go into a DIPA without making it overly dark, overly caramel, or overly heavy. Although they went with the mosaic hop, something that might be a bit unconventional, they still execute a highly commercial beer with wide appeal. They also keep it juicy and tough enough for someone looking for something a bit more complex to dissect. This is a fantastic beer across all categories, except for maybe feel which is a bit ambiguous at times. Either way, this beer, especially since it is following Dirtwolf, is further evidence of the great things that Victory is doing with hops these day.","TheBrewo","Jan 24, 2014"

Sweet aroma of lemon peel, dankness, honey, pale malts, funky grass. This almost has a farmhouse/brett aroma but then the hops really take over. Flavor is sweet lemony hops with some light pine and lots of grassiness, very light sweetness from the malts in the background. Very smooth and low to medium bitter for the style. Medium mouthfeel, resinous, but surprisingly light for a double IPA! Hard to believe this is 9%. Could be dangerous. Very nice brew.","BMMillsy","Jan 24, 2014"

You cannot equate this with any other DIPA on the market and it deserves top honors. Since it reminds me so much of a Brett-infused beer (see above), it is amazing to see how hops can mimmick that flavor profile. Furthermore, the price (~$10.50 4-Pack) is an absolute bargain which makes it all-the-more attractive. I know Victory is not available to everyone, but those who get Victory beers and love a great DIPA with caracteristics which you have yet to experience, do yourself a favor and grab yourself a 4-Pack","threeviews","Jan 20, 2014"

It just would not compete with two far superior (in my opinion) double IPAs cannibalizing sales. The brewing world really needs to give Victory it's due now. This is a brewery that has totally reinvented its approach to its IPAs after its existing IPA skus stopped being truly relevant in the market years ago. Hop Devil and Hop Wallop are fine beers, but they just don't get the beer geeks going like they used to. Now Victory has released two top-notch, hype-worthy double IPAs in the past few months. Hop Ranch and Dirt Wolf are on par with the best double IPAs in the country. In my opinion they can stack up with the likes of Pliny or Heady Topper. And the beauty of it is that they should have a much broader reach in the national market. Very impressive.","ryan1788a5","Jan 15, 2014"

Hop Wallop (R.I.P.), Dirt Wolf, and now this all have something in common: each one is (was) a technically very well-crafted brew with excellent flavors, aroma, appearance, and feel, but all feel like they err on the side of caution (if you call scores above 4.0 erring in any way). They do everything very, very well, but nothing quite comes off as brilliant. That said, I can’t overstate the fact that Victory did everything—every single aspect of this beer—very, very well. And $10-11/sixer for a DIPA of this quality? Yes please.","fmccormi","Jan 12, 2014"

Wafting from the bottle is a touch of fruit cocktail. Nice popping carbo delivers white grape/lemony zest hop flavors followed by a very faint pale malt, ending with a slight tart dryness. No lingering bitterness at all. Just slightly tart and dry which induces my next swig. Drinkability is off the charts. Previous to having this I knocked down a Rogue Yellow Snow IPA ironically being more the heavy sipper. Hop Ranch is light and thirst quenching for a DIPA. Very dangerous, I recommend especially if your a hop fan. So glad I don't have to search far from home for quality IPAs/DIPAs thanks Victory for Hop Ranch/Dirt Wolf and Troegs for IPA and Nugget Nectar...","beerdedking","Jan 10, 2014"

4.46,5.7,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very lightly hazy gold colored beer and nice white half inch head. Lace is stringy and shifting. After the head fades there remains a broken, thin white layer over the beer and a ring around the edge. Aroma is very clean with an uplifting mix of tropical and citrus fruit. Sweet red grapefruit, candy lime, mango, passionfruit, a little bit of zesty spicy hop, a touch of pine, and a soft caramel-dough malt profile. Flavor is equally loaded with tropical fruity varieties and citrus with more pronounced pine, tea, and earthiness. Dry, powdery, acidic, mouthwatering bitterness throughout the finish. I wonder if there's honey in this... The alcohol or high ABV is completely hidden to me. This is a pretty excellent, friendly double IPA. Very amiable.","tastybeer","Jan 08, 2014"
4.02,-4.7,3.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall - This is a very tropical, juicy, west coast style hop bomb of an ipa. Its a double ipa so I'm pretty sure this beer is around 9% but it is so smooth you would think your drinking a six percent ipa. I gave this beer a 4 (which is rare to even come above 3.75 for me I'm pretty harsh with ratings and reviews ) But the fact of how easy this drinks for a DIPA....I couldn't help but hit 4. So drinkable, juicy and unbelievable. This beer deserves every good rating it gets. Great job victory, holy SHIT.","Glennlawless","Beers"

Instead of going for a big tropical hop explosion like so many DIPAs, or upping the malts and balancing things out like the East Coast is known for, Victory has created a bold yet delicate brew with elements of US, English and even Belgian beers. But despite it's complexity, it drinks super easy and would be welcome at a meal or hanging with friends. Probably an excellent companion to Dirtwolfas well, as each showcase American hops without sacrificing balance and drinkability, and bring a very different profile to the table.","BKBassist","Jan 08, 2014"

Nice aroma, full of lemony hops and ripe tropical fruits. After the aroma, the taste was a bit of a let-down. Lemon pith, neutral alcohol, and a lasting graininess, ushering in a wave of bitterness that, though appropriate for the style, seemed to wash away much of the fruity/citrusy goodness that I was expecting from the nose.

4.27,1.2,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Bright golden yellow color with a slight haze covered by a small, tightly bubbled head that shrinks to large groups of soapy bubbles at the edges. Peppery, pungent hop aroma featuring pink grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerine coated in an aromatic herbal marijuana-like dankness. The dank, resinous, sticky-icky-ness continues into the flavor before transitioning immediately to a more sweet, festive fruit profile. Citrus, mango, grape, melon, and pear all contribute a solid sweetness to counter the initial blast of peppery, herbal weed. Lingering oily, resinous, almost acidic notes left behind. Drinks maybe more like 8%, but you can tell you're drinking a serious beer, even if the alcohol never really shows itself. Medium-plus, creamy body with a fairly hefty bitterness. A big, pungently hoppy DIPA. Victory keeps on kicking ass.","wedge","Jan 05, 2014"

I'd have to agree. I've been a little negative after all the Dirtwolf hype, but I have to say that both of these are really tasty new DIPAs with comparatively low prices.

Smell of massive citrus and topical fruits, with a hint of breadiness. The mouthfeel is medium; closer to an IPA, but the taste is just incredible, with tart lemon and grapefruit and tropical fruits up front, followed by a malty, bready backbone that is tempered by hop bitterness. It doesn't have the perfect balance of Dirtwolf, but the taste is just incredible.","surfmanjim","Dec 31, 2013"
4.27,1.2,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured from bottle into a chilled pint glass. Nice thick white head which did not dissipate much at all. Good even lacing all the way. The nose was outstanding, with strong piney, lemon/pineapple/grapefruit scents and an obviously strong hop presence. On the palate, the taste was not quite as compelling as the nose, with an almost grassy dank on the tip, although the finish was very smooth and citrusy pleasant. Mouthfeel was average, nothing extraordinary. Overall, a very good example of the style. I like this much better than DirtWolf, even if it did not live up to all the hype and expectations I had based upon same. Will gladly hoard this while I can, but there are other IPAs and DIPAs I would reach for over this. Not a lot of them, but enough. In any event, another strong effort by Victory, which seems to be kickin' A these days. Kudos!","JohnParadee","Dec 31, 2013"

4.43,5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This tastes way better than average for the beer style since it just has so much hop flavor without a bunch of sweet malt to cover. The taste of hops is drenched in the beer with slight pepper and mild lime zest but mainly I get a more orange rind sweet and tangy taste which indicates some Mosaic however I have not heard of the other hop so I will just say sweetened grapefruit in its raw form with very low astringency or any acidic bite. I love how easy this is to enjoy until you consumed three and want to try to transcribe the review, haha. I do think this is a nice compliment to the Dirt Wolf that was just released as it is a stronger IPA, but seems a little less bitter to my tastebuds","Slatetank","Dec 30, 2013"

4.43,5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,"Pours a crisp, clear light golden color with a thick, creamy white head that settles to a thin film with clumpy streaks of lacing. Juicy, sweaty nose of pineapple, mango, and general tropical goodness with a light grassy earthiness. Very easy drinking with a light, crisp body that drinks like it's 7% and not the listed 9%. Flavor starts initially with an overload of tropical juice and fruit before transitioning to a piney and slightly grassy finish. No distinct malt presence anywhere in the body and not overly bitter in the finish. Drinks like a bright West Coast IPA or a lesser Double Sunshine. For what this is, (a hopefully) year round-ish "shelf" IPA that will see distro in multiple states, I can't think of anything better. Not in the class of the best VT or CA IPAs but damn good enough.","yourefragile","Dec 28, 2013"

4.42,4.7,4.25,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Medium body with a blast of dank, sticky hops providing the perfect amount of dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt backbone into a dry finish. The hop profile is very complex with resinous oils, earthy, grassy pine, tropical/citrus fruit sweetness and scallion/onion-y, summit-like flavors. Really well balanced with a stronger tropical/citrus fruit character than the nose hinted at and delicate pale malts countering the earthy bitterness. Hints of grapefruit, mango, pineapple and lemon peel followed by subtle biscuit and graham cracker flavor. The ABV is excellently masked with no heat to speak of. Dangerously drinkable which is surprising considering this beer's complexity. One of the better IPAs I've had in some time. This beer destroys DirtWolf in my opinion and is up there with some of the best batches of Stone Enjoy By. I haven't been a big fan of most of Victory's IPAs but I highly recommend seeking this beer out.","corby112","Dec 22, 2013"
