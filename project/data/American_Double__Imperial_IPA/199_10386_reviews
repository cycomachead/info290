"I wish there was a bottled on date... IPAs should be fresh to fully enjoy. Certainly a malty nose with hints of orange candy and pineapple. Taste is very balanced with sweet malts and sticky resinous pine (also a hint of sweet juice). A bit of booze in the finish but the 10% is well hidden. Complex and quite enjoyable - let it warm a bit!"

"Verdict: A great DIPA from Ballast Point, lots of pine, which normally I take exception to, but this works so well, lots of backing notes of citrus, tropical fruit, wildflower and gentle malt. The balance is wonderful and despite the high ABV, this remains so drinkable and the alcohol is exceptionally hidden."
""
"Big juicy hop nose, tons of pine bitterness, boozy...great sipping DIPA...gets better as you get closer to room temp"
"I was  expecting a booze bomb on this one,  but was glad to drink another great brew from Ballast Point!  Dorado did not measure up to Sculpin, but a solid DIPA that will not disappoint."

"I really don't care for the taste of this beer."
"T: Stone fruit, berries, various melon. Pine bitterness. Grassy, honey pollen undertones."

"I drank this while on a ski vacation -- bought a bottle from a local store.  This might have been a freshness issue, but it just didn't taste like what I expected -- I usually like Ballast Point IPA's."
"In my opinion the best IPA BP makes."
"O- nice pine-forward hops that is matched by a sweet malty backbone"
"Definitely a funky aroma, I'd say ripe pineapple. Bittery and alcoholy throughout with a bitter alcohol finish. I like how this beer stayed away from maltiness. Looks like a sculpin, but the taste is way different and completely unexpected. Really unique overall for the double double IPA style."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely not for the timid.  Aroma is of decaying fruit which is not entirely unpleasant.  You would think with the ABV(10.0) alcohol would prevail in the nose and flavor, but no, it does not show up til later.  Very hoppy grapefruit right up front fades to a very strong sticky, bitter finish.  Oh yeah, here comes the alcohol from out of nowhere that actually ads a whole other layer that is totally unexpected.   Reminds me of gin. Powerful stuff!"
""
""
""
""
"First beer I tried from Ballast Point, as they recently expanded to WI.  Truly drinkable double/IIPAs are few and far between, but this one nails it.  At 10% ABV, it is not for the faint of heart; this is a beer for those who at least like hop-heavy regular IPA brews like Dogfish Head 90-Minute or Sierra Nevada Torpedo.  With that in mind, it's surprisingly light for its ABV, with  (relatively) balanced flavor and character reminiscent of other B.Point beers like Big Eye or Sculpin."
"Very tasty, good hop bitter flavor, a tasty dipa"
""
"I was a little disappointed by this, mainly because I love the Sculpin so much. I found it a little boozy and bitter- the fruity aftertaste didn't have a strong enough punch. It's still a solid beer, but just didn't quite live up to the Sculpin or Big Eye in my opinion."
""
""
"I really wanted to like this beer, because I loved Sculpin and GF Sculpin and thought this might be a juicier, more resinous version of the aforementioned. At 10%, this one is heavy, but the alcohol wasn't really detectable, which was nice. Appeared much like Sculpin; a copper-orange, totally translucent brew with a nice thick head. Smelled pretty nice, but not as dank and fruity as either of the other IPAs. The taste was what really threw me off. I got bitterness, bitterness, and a lingering bitter finish. I can appreciate a nice dry bitter finish, but this was bitter and just bitter all the way through. I'll skip and go for something a little more balanced next time."
""
""
"Yes!  Another great BP BEER!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great malt hop balance xx"
""
"Is there something a bit heavy and... syrupy in the flavor here? Hops profile isn't what I'd expected. There's just... bitterness and more bitterness. None of the resiny aromatics that I'd expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dorado is Sculpin's big brother at 10%."

"Overall- Picked up a single 12 Oz bottle when I found some Grapefruit Sculpin at a local bottle shop and had heard some good things about it. Glad I got to try it and glad that I decided to with food. I love double IPAs, but this one skated too close to all the things that can ruin the style for me (mouth drying hops, hop finish, a bit too piney, etc.). Recommend it, easily above average."
""
""
"Really good DIPA. 10% abv hidden well. Ballast Point rarely disappoints."
"Prefer Sculpin to this, fairly dissapointed."
""
""
"Had an off smell after pouring. I can only describe it as funky. Very boozy tasting with an initial sweetness that wasn't expected. I can see the appeal but it wasn't for me"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but like sculpin better"
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - ABV well-hidden, quaffable."

"This bottle was almost nine months old. To be fair to this beer, I will try to pick up a fresh one and taste it again. It had a nice bitter, crisp hop taste but I could tell something had probably faded with age."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Ballast Point where have you been all my life?  I just discovered these guys this past year after hearing a lot of chatter about Sculpin IPA.  These guys don't make bad beers.  Definitely would recommend anything these guys brew."
""
"Surprisingly dynamic taste despite 10% abv"
"Pours a lighter amber with a short-lived creamy white head leaving small soapy lacing. The aroma is mild, grapefruit citrus and floral. The taste is similar with a little bit of pine added to the mix and just a hint of malt. The body is thinner, easy drinking, with a just a slightly bitter bite on the finish."
"A good and strong IPA— generously hoppy, with a dry and slightly bitter finish. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Right, so this is delicious. Sculpin is basically perfect in my eyes and this isn't far behind."
"(bottle, 12oz) Amber/Orange color; nose more fruity than hoppy; hops become more present throughout tasting and the alcohol reveals itself towards the end (2/23/15)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EPITOME of what it means to be a west coast IPA, done better than most any other WC IPA I have tried."
""
""
"Might have had a bottle slightly past its prime, smell and look were great but taste was quite bitter and not in a crisp hoppy way. I will try it again and revise this if necessary."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter, great bitterness, a bit boozy, but great as expected as a West Coast double."
""
"Hoppy, floral and a bit boozy. It's delicious but No Sculpin."
"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."
""
""
"Good double ipa. But not the best I've had. Very boozy"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I'm really impressed with this DIPA from Ballast Point.  Hits all the marks--some sweetness, good hop flavor, some booziness.  Glad to have another A plus DIPA option to choose from!"
""
""
"Classic DIPA amber color, clear body, and one finger thick head greeted me upon pouring.  The aroma was a lot more subdued than expected.  It took a really deep whiff to get a sense of the hop presence in the beer, and even then it felt a faint.  I could detect grapefruit, orange peel, a some apricot.  The taste was much bolder than the smell.  There was a lot of grapefruit pith, lime, bitter orange, and other citrus flavors, as well as some pine resin.  The malt was secondary, but noticeable.  The body of the beer was dense, sticky, and filling.  The alcohol was very well hidden, and without reading the label, it would never have been guessed to be a double digit ABV beer.  This was a very enjoyable take on a strong DIPA without being almost a barleywine.  Delicious to the last sip."
""
""
""
"Likely past it's prime and may have to revisit. All sweet caramel, bready, spicy malt with faded citrus (grapefruit, orange) and bitter, soapy hops. Slightly grassy, and a bit of a plastic smell to it. Like a typically overhopped west coast ipa or poorly executed American barleywine."
""
""
""
"A HUGE, powerful mouth-punch of a DIPA. Very intense, but tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good Double IPA focusing mostly on woody pine flavor. It's worth drinking again but it wasn't anything special."
""

""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this, especially the earthy note throughout. Based on some of the comments below if you can, find it fresh & on tap"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, I can't say I enjoyed this one nearly as much as many others did. Nothing terrible here, but it just fell flat for me basically across the board. My main complaint was with the mouth feel. It simply seems flat and watery, not enjoyable at all. There are much better examples of the site of the style on the shelf in my opinion."
""
""
"Love the ominous murky pour. Tastes like double big eye. Pretty good.. But the 10 percent probably not necessary"
""
""
""
"Dorado is right up there with Heady Topper as an IPA comparable (and I indulged in one yesterday), but I can report with confidence that it is a beverage that you can count on from aperetif to dessert!  Outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a malt bomb. I seriously do not understand what people see in Ballast Point, especially considering the craft game now. It seems outdated with their beers. Malt bomb, mild citrus notes. Refreshing yes, but nothing to brag about. C in my book"
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied with but does seem to be a bit bigger here and there. It has a nice smooth feel but there is an aggressive aftertaste that takes a brief moment to settle down. One the bitterness in the aftertaste dies down there is plenty of pleasant fruity after tones."
""
""
""
""
""
"Horrible. dark, malty, cardboard. Keg not dated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a big flavorful beer that did not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good DIPA and worth shanking the guy in front of you for. The hoppiness is strong enough for a DIPA and there is enough of a sweet malt backbone to keep it from being too hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz. 1 1/2 fingers and great lacing as you sip it. Smells of resin and definitely tea, green.  Loads of citrus and dry hops flavors coming through on the palate.  Leaves a crisp and dry mouthfeel.  Green flavors (tannins?) weird.  Finishes full, a bit hot!"
""
""
"This is one of the best double IPAs I've ever had."
""
""
""
"one of the most interesting big ipas i can remember ever drinking. i wish i knew what hops were in this, because it has such a weird (and amazing) taste and mouthfeel, something totally foreign to my palate really. the beer looks like any other in its class, clear bright golden with a tall white head that leaves ring lacing as it drinks. the smell and taste have one of the more curious hop profiles out there. its fruity sure, but its neither oily or sweet, almost drying and sharp, but it isnt piney either. its almost tea-like, intense and bitter but also super flavorful. really hard to describe, but i get everything from lime to green tea to coriander seed to melon and meadow grass. its none of those things and all of them, like no other. its super bitter and strong, but the alcohol is well hidden, a dangerous bomber to tackle. something so strange with the hops though, its all in the middle. it rises up mid-palate, and dies back quickly, but that sensation and flavor in the middle is so cool and different. i would love to know what hops they use to create that. maybe better than sculpin in some ways, one of the best on the shelf india pales that exists."
""
"A bot of a boozy afterbreath. Almost like ferett piss. But they mask the ABV pretty well overall."
"Came off as overly boozy. Wasnt a huge fan of hop profile, tasted unorganic"
""
""
""
""
""
"Loved this beer the sweet hoppy taste was perfect."
""
""
""
""
"The smell of this beer blew me away.  So hoppy and sweet.  Golden orange/yellow on the pour.  Lacing on glass.  Head dissipates, spotty on surface.  Taste yields alcohol, too prevalent.  Aftertaste leaves mouth very dry.  Very good beer - the outstanding smell pushes this to a 4 score, but is not outstanding overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly bitter, balanced with a fair bit of malt sweetness.  In fact, too much malt sweetness."
""
""
"Goof beer a little heavy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: tasty, very unique with a lot of tropical fruit. It's not as much my style, but still easy to appreciate the level of craftsmanship"
"Don't drink if ur afraid of BIG flavor"
"Would gladly drink any day."

""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A decent DIPA.  I hadn't heard a lot about it, but with all of the hype around Sculpin (deserved) and Grapefruit Sculpin (still TBD), I wanted to give it a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily one of my top five DIPAs.  Nice malt backbone, well-balanced.  Great brewery to constant quality."
""
""
""
""
"Banger strong beer fishy fishy"
""
""
""
"O: At $13.99 for a six-pack, this is a pretty great bargain for a DIPA. It may not be in my rotation as much as Sculpin or Victory at Sea, but it'll be a beer I seek out when craving a DIPA. Ballast Point simply does not disappoint."
""
"22 oz into a tulip. Deep orange-amber with white head that left a good set of lacing.  The aroma is the star in this brew. A touch of floral with a lot of tropical and a hint of sweet maltiness. This was evident even when still a bit too cold to drink. So, my usual experience with big DIPAs is that the flavor is a bigger, more pronounced sensory experience than the aroma (more so than taste usually is to smell in the obvious sense). And so this was a slight disappointment in that the taste was pretty much in line with the aroma - nothing extra came forth. Having said that, I was a lovely taste of floral hops up front with the tropicals and malt hint across the a palate with a nice, resinous finish that was not as sticky as other DIPAs.  In terms of my personal preferences, this is probably that beer that is in the best of tier 2, but another bottle may raise the rating. Kind of like a soccer team that yo-yo's between relegation-from and promotion-to tot top league. Or maybe a better analogy would be the Padres (in making a San Diego metaphor): historically a 4A team."
""
"One of if not my favorite Ballast Point beers. The perfect blend of hoppiness with a sweet, malty backbone that makes it super drinkable."
""
""
"Overall- A rich, complex, and smooth 2xipa. The malt was balanced quite nicely and the fruity aroma was much taste to take in. The alcohol could have been concealed a bit more in the finish but this does not really matter. A special release indeed by a talanted brewery. Well worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty alcoholic. Pretty bitter but a good bitter. This taste more like a double imperial ipa. The malts are pretty subtle but I just can't taste the hops that much. This beer confuses me. Not that great"
""
""
"O--I wanted to like this one more.  Just didn't have the hop forwardness I was looking for.  Its pretty well balanced, I could definitely see why people enjoy this beer.  I lean towards the tropical flavors and while I could smell them I just didn't taste them enough."
""
"Overall: An excellent DIPA, if you love Big Eye and Sculpin you'll love this.  Ballast Point makes some fantastic brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"outs,tanding follow up to sculpin I just received my first Dorado fantastic Beerl, love thr balanced  hop and mild malt finishes with a beautifull sweet bitter hoppiness ."
""
"Overall, this is the hop bomb hop juice hop beer you've been looking for.  Unless, like me, you're not looking for that, in which case, move along and leave it to the hopheads."

"22oz bottle served in pint glass.  Beer pours a brilliant orange hue, topped with a large white foamy head.  Big citrus aroma: lemon peel, freshly squeezed orange juice.  Flavor is really big on hops, of course, and spicy.  Deliciously grapefruity hop flavors, but turned up so loud, that like really hot Indian food or chili, it keeps you from consuming it too fast.  Which is good because at 10% this bomber will knock me on my ass.  But, that is, per se, a vote against this being a well-balanced beer.  Still, it is not completely one dimensional.  I'd rather drink this than Ruination, but Maharaja and 90 minute are better still."
"A well-balanced, nicely complex double IPA. Crisp hop bitterness and bready malt flavors blend well together with the high ABV keeping in the background yet contributing somewhat to the relative dryness of the beer. Very approachable and very tasty..."

"At times overlooked, but quite possibly the quintessential San Diego DIPA.  Hits all the traditional notes of grapefruit, orange, tangerine, and pine.  Perfectly balanced, it has the drinkability of a much lesser ABV brew.  No alcohol presence whatsoever.  One of my favorite beers, period.  It's so well put together, why wouldn't it be?  Approachable, yet plenty hoppy for the most discerning hop head..."

"Aroma was lemon, orange, honey, big malt sweetness, floral. Poured golden amber with a white head, medium to full bodied, it was heavy and sticky and prickly on the palate. Tastes of citrus fruits, that lemon and orange/tangerine were there, a big malt sweetness and hop bitterness strike a good balance. Not my first pick for a double IPA but a very good one regardless."
""
"Good beer. Not the best double IPA I have tried, but very solid all around."
""
""
""

"10/18/2014.  On draft at Chuck’s 85th as part of a 4-Ballast Point beer sampler. Golden hue, pretty clear, thick head and lots of lace on the sides. Strong hops notes, with lots of citrus - grapefruit in particular, and tropical fruits like passionfruit. Caramel and brown sugar from the malt. Strong bitter flavor, then sweetness from the malt, overall a good balance. Body is heavy and oily, a little alcohol pepperiness, not highly carbonated. Overall another great beer from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep golden body, off-white head and great lacing. Floral aromas. A hefty malt base with hoppy pine flavors and bitter clean dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma is great. Mind you Sculpin is my favorite IPA.  Head is beautiful, with fair retention!  Laces nicely in my Sam Adams glass. Color is fairly clear copper. As it warms it really lights up!  Really kicking off a nice hoppy & fruity smell!  Mouthfeel is good. Taste is big at first, but soon after turns sharp and kind of alchoholish. In my opinion this is a solid beer, but not the most balanced.  A good IPA, yes. A good DIPA?  I've had better. I'll stick with the Sculpin a much better overall IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Got the bomber online for $16.00..  Wow.. I've had the Big Eye, but this one was bigger.  Had another IPA from Japan before trying this one and it set itself apart.  The aroma was deep and wholesome, hops and malts balanced but the hops were what was making me go back for another whiff. Finally the taste was not what I expected with a 10% ABV.  This was smooth.  Too smooth, dangerously. Sip, sip. Mouthfeel was just what I wanted.  Carbonation without carbonation, slid right on in.  Taste was just great, great, great. No need food, I'm drinking everything I need right here.  In the end I took care of it and it took care if me.  I regret the IPA's I warmed up with.  This is a powerful, tasty brew.  I want more!"

"Big fan of the couple of BP IPAs that I have tried. Perhaps then big expectations for this double. Finger of white head and amber body, good look overall. Very big aromas. Got lots of orange, citrus, pine, a random floral note. Bright and hoppy nose. This had a strong malt backbone and overall bright, clean palate. Nice amt of bitterness and definitely caught a nice pine taste as the glass warmed. Bit oily mouthfeel (DIPA anyone?), but good. As expected. I was not blown away by this beer, however it was really, really good. Sculpin may be a bit more balanced than it's bigger brother... but this is definitely one to try for the IPA crowd. Can't wait to go to my conference in San Diego next spring. Go Ballast Point!"

"o: the tropical fruits in here are nice, but this is pretty bitter. for me the bitterness seems to wash away all those flavors and take center stage. its still pretty good though, and has a real nice mouthfeel. its big though"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely enjoyed the beer, but I've also definitely had better. I would buy it again for sure. I think it would benefit from more aroma and less hop bitterness. More dry-hopping and fewer bittering hops would be great."

"Tawny golden beer topped by a creamy white foam that recedes gradually leaving sheets of lace. Not a big nose, but I'm getting earthy bread, faint lemons, marmelade. Taste pine and resin, honeydew melon, papaya, oranges, lemons. Moderate bitterness with ample malt makes for one of the rarer hop forward yet juicy, wet, refreshing type of balanced brews. Delicious. Firm carbonation, medium body, creamy mouthfeel. A very well crafted, delicious beer. Mild bitter, clean finish. Shocking easy to quaff being 10% ABV. Will buy again."

"Overall, a nice double IPA from BP. It's 10% ABV and you can tell. Good bitterness level but could use more dry hopping for increased juiciness."
""
""
"This pours a golden amber in color with a thin layer of foaming on top. I get a piney aroma to it up front, followed by a touch of orange peel and a puff of caramel. The flavor is intensely piney with some orange peel citrus character and a resiny sweetness. I found it malty and somewhat bready, achieving a nice balance."

"Clear gold color with a touch of orange. White head that faded rapidly into a thin collar and wisps. Aroma is faint citrus, grainy malt sweetness, slightly piney. Nice hop bitterness, medium-high carbonation, medium-low body. Taste is grainy malt, grassy/floral hop and grapefruit citrus, very faint spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a clear light copper color with a thin layer of head that dissipated almost immediately. The nose is certainly hoppy. The flavor is dominated by the hop profile except for a touch of citrus that pokes through the hops. This is certainly a fine offering, but it pales in comparison to Sculpin."

"I'm hard-pressed to think of another brewery that offers a more impressive trio of hop bombs - Ballast Point's Sculpin, Big Eye, and Dorado are among the best IPAs you'll find in the country. This is a brewery that not only gets the need for character, but also the importance of balance. Everything this brewer touches turns to gold - Dorado (obviously) included."
""
"This is a solid DIPA. It's relatively fresh so it's enjoyable, but nothing too spectacular. It's well crafted for sure, but I'd still take a Sculpin over this any day of the week."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a solid imperial IPA. It runs the gambit from sweetness to dryness playing on the tongue the whole way.  Edited review upped my rating from a 4.27 to a 4.44 - this is definitely something for me to seek out, especially on the fresh side."
""
""

"Mouthfeel is dry, thick but not sticky. Overall, this is pretty good, but I'm not overwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is really strong. Dark hue, large frothy head, and plenty of persistent lacing. Nose is floral pine, with sweet and citrus. Really hoppy and pungent, with some bitter pecan and citrus. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't particularly good, but not terrible objectionable. It does taste kind of old. I'll re-review with a fresher bottle if there are significant changes."
"Drinkability: For the QPR (I forget how much it was, but in the end, I paid way too much for it), I'm pretty disappointed. Ballast Point seems to keep reminding me of Trent Richardson's current Fantasy Football season: I always start him hoping for a lot of good things, but I """paid""" too much for something that can't get above what a similar 5th round pick could do for another team with a worse offensive line. I won't give up -- and on the whole this isn't a bad beer in any way really in the grand scheme of things -- but man, this didn't hit the mark at all for me when it comes to what I expected, and I won't be going back to it."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid double IPA that is traditional with west coast offerings. I don't have much left of distributed beers from these in Boston. One more style and I might have to make a road trip after that."
""
"O - A big, brash, powerhouse of a beer. Reminds me of a less alcoholic 120 Minute. I have had this before, and being two months past the best by date seemingly did nothing to weaken the impact of the hops. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys their DIPA's on the sweeter side. A serious repeat buy for me, and I found myself wishing I had another as soon as I finished."
"A bitter DIPA that with some chemical off-flavours and harsh hops. I have had better."
""
""
""
"i remember enjoying this brew fresh from the taps at the Ballast Point home brew shop several years ago, so i jumped at the shot to grab a 22oz for $5. maybe the bottle had been sitting for awhile, because i believe the hops have fallen out significantly. the beer is completely opaque; my hand disappears behind the cloudy, amber liquid in the glass. lacing is significant all across the glass. nose honeyed stone fruit, and some caramel malts. on the palate i detect aromas of dried apricot, more malt sweetness, and something reminiscent of toasted nuts. there is some bitterness on the back end, but also lingering, syrupy alcohol sweetness, too. as it stands, this product is everything i dislike about imperial or double ipas: cloying sweetness as a result of raising the abv without the heady hop aromas i love so much about west coast ipa. if there was any brewed on/enjoy by date, it was covered up by the $5 handmade price tag. this will be a hard bottle to finish. will update the review when i can confirm i have a fresh bottle/draft in hand."

"Excellent double IPA. Great color and a perfect balance of hop aroma. Just the right amount of malt to give it a well-balanced taste and a great mouthfeel. Mediuim to dark copper appearance. Ballast Point hit all the right points with this. This could easily makes its way to my top 10 list of double IPA's."

"O - This is my first Ballast Point. I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. I got a much more complex aroma and taste than I thought I would, with all sorts of sweet citrus fruits dominating the palate. Very good DIPA"
""
"Overall - This is an excellent DIPA, and one that is worth seeking out, but I have to say that I think I like the flavors of Sculpin (IPA by this same brewer) a little more. Hops are mostly orange/red citruses and lots of floral flavors. Alcohol is pretty well hidden, but becomes more apparent halfway thru the bomber. Give this one a try."
""
"O - Really solid Double IPA! Super well balanced for a double IPA! Really well crafted and thought out beer and is definitely a must have from Ballast Point! I feel like this one gets put on the back burner by Sculpin but if you want a more balanced Double IPA you can't go wrong here! Great beer from Ballast Point!"

"A good IIPA, but not quite terrific. Would definitely have it again though."
""
""
"Poured into belgian tulip; slightly hazy bright orange with a lovely fluffy white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smell is pine, pine, pine; some hints of citrus rind and sweet fruit peek through but it's mostly pine. Taste is surprisingly complex compared to the smell; starts off with sweet malt but moves quickly into bitter/spicy hops with strong pine tastes. Finishes with drying bitter and spiciness, leaving some lingering sweetness and a hint of alcohol heat. Damn good west-coast IPA, this could hold its own against stuff like Ruination."
""
""
""
"O - Very dissapponting. Extremely disjointed and nthey need to add more of something to balance out flavor and alcohol. It tastes like an very boozy Hoptimum. I hope I had a bad bottle. Still love BP! May need a Sculpin to satisfy my palate."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy amber color with a thick foamy head.  Head retention is great.  Lacing is moderate.  Has a deep citrus aroma with mild pine and very slight caramel.  Excellent aroma.  Great malt to hop transition with smooth, caramel, citrus flavor.  Great citrus aftertaste that is very soapy.    Just a little too astringent.  Very good beer.  Hides alcohol content very well."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/18/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing lings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, tangerine, orange rind, grapefruit, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, honey, biscuit, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright hop notes with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange rind, pine, floral, grass, honey, biscuit, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, pine, honey, biscuit, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of bright hop notes with moderate bready malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, sticky, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden for 10%, with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate bready malt balance; and very smooth to sip on for 10%. A very enjoyable offering."

"The hops seem to get stomped out by the alcohol taste in this double ipa. It's not bad but just not very balanced. If you like big beers, this is for you. It almost tastes oak aged. It would be great if the hops cut through more yet the alcohol taste is dominant."
""
""

"Overall: This is better than Sculpin (better feel, maybe not quite as good flavor/aroma, but a better balanced beer). Worth a try."
"Overall, Dorado is a big bold beer. I ordered it because it was the first time I'd seen it (since BP started distributing in Washington a couple weeks ago), but you might need to be in the mood for such a monster of a DIPA. Generally I like my beers lighter and more refreshing. For what it is, though, it's good and well executed."

"very solid IIPA, would drink again, and at 9.99 worth at LEAST 1 try. would recommend/try again"
""
"Balance is the watchword here: aggressive hopping and big malts to balance the scales make this an impressive and """big""" beer. Perhaps the maltiest of IIPAs that I found flavorful and drinkable, Dorado is a solid effort from Ballast Point. Although a pricey number at $10, it is worth a try at least once to experience such a well balanced Southern Cali IIPA."

"The aftertaste is all hops, but nice. Not nasty. There is no boozy taste at all. This was a nice one to try in a growler from Saveon in Mentor."
""
""
""
"Poured a deep lemon yellow with an amber tint and a slight haze. A big head of soft creamy foam that dwindled like it had all day to a thick cap and collar. Sticky, beautiful lacing. Excellent retention. Looks so good. Nose is not as strong as you would expect to look at this beer but it smells great. Citrus, lemon, tangerine, lime, you can smell the hop resin, tropical, grassy and some good strong pale malt with a lot of caramel and sugar. Taste is awesome. It’s dry, crisp, refreshing, malt is deep and rich a little sugary, the hops are resiny and bitter with all the fruits washing over the palate. There was no alcohol on the nose but it is on the palate and it mingles well. Gentle carbonation and a good mouthfeel. This is a fantastic DIPA that comes right up to Stone for bitterness but stops before it becomes arrogant. Smooth and very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice, well-balanced DIPA. Neither the hops or malts overwhelm, and the alcohol doesn't overpower either, which is nice for a nearly 10% beer. A nice little sipper because of the 10%, but it is enjoyable throughout multiple temperature ranges. A bit pricey at $10.99 for a bomber, but nice to have every once in a while"
""
""
""
"O: a really well-done DIPA - on par with a lot of the better DIPAs. Must-try for D/IPA fans and beer advocates in general. If you like BP's Sculpin IPA, you will surely appreciate this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Big, malty, sweet, hoppy, and bitter. I remember this being a bit better. Still pretty good."
""
""
"O- For the ABV, this is one hell of an IPA. Equally as good as Sculpin IMO."
""
""
""
"Damn flashbacks to crappy late-90s/early-00s animated films... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises pine needle, light menthol, mild sweet biscuit, and light spicy greens. The taste mirrors this mixture exactly. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this is an average DIPA at best, one that is actually balanced (a plus), but one that just doesn't distinguish itself in any real way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body. Sticky and oily. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good malt start. This yields to some alcohol warmth. The swallow features some grapefruit rind tasting hop bitterness. Long bitter aftertaste, but this is not extreme. Creamy body with a subdued carbonation level. Deceptively easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Dorado is a really good DIPA, but there are a lot of really good DIPAs readily available out there. I think this offering, while very good, needs a signature vlavor or aroma. Not a gimmick, but something that helps to set it apart from other high-quality DIPAs. Well worth taking a look at for sure."
""
""
""
"Taste is dominated by sweet caramel malts and floral hops. Taste starts with floral hops, then caramel and toffee malts, then mango, lemon, and orange hops. Has a malty, floral,slightly boozy finish that is a touch resinous. Not as hop forward as what is ideal for me, but still a great flavor. Has a medium body with low carbonation. A very good beer, not exactly my preference for a DIPA (A little too malty and sweet/floral)."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good DIPA. Dorado starts with a wonderful spicy, floral nose and has a huge hop presence with a decent about of malt to balance things out. The bittering hops are a bit out of balance for me and while the beer finishes clean and dry, there is too much unbalance bitterness in the middle. I am splitting hairs here though and am comparing Dorado against other stellar high gravity IPAs."
""
"O: Awesome complexity on this one. The nose hits you with one thing and the taste gets you with another. Very refreshing for a DIPA because of the exceptional balance."
"O- A solid DIPA, I would hope for a little better considering this is the brewey that makes Sculpin. But a good DIPA regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty solid DIPA here. drinkability is good as the bitterness has been kept in check and there is balance between grist and hops. nothing earth-shattering here, but certainly worth checking out for all you hop heads out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden amber with a one and half finger fluffy white head; great retention with fairly evident splotchy lacing. Balanced citrus aroma. Mandarin orange, lemon peel, and lime on the nose. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, lime, hints of sweet caramel malt. Finishes dry with lime and lime peel bitterness. Full bodied slick, smooth with moderate carbonation. A very balanced and enjoyable DIPA. There is plenty here to satisfy any hophead, yet the drinkability of this brew will be appreciated by a wider variety of beer drinkers."
"O - A double IPA done right. I'm amazed at how well the alcohol is masked, it drinks way too easy for a ten percent beer. A real treat for any hop head."
""
"Overall: Was excited at the nose because I much prefer the tropical/citrus IPA's to the piney/resinous ones but actually much enjoyment to be had by this beer."
""
""
""
""
"While a very good DIPA, the scales are tipped a bit too far towards the sweet end. Dorado is good, but Sculpin is a much better, much more balanced IPA."

"I currently live in Boston MA. which is drinking city, and went back to San Diego to work on my friends airplane. After I was done I found the local liquor store to buy a beer and since Ballst point is a west coast and San Diego thing and hard to get on the east caost I got this with my take out dinner and it was the best beer I have ever had, and trust me I have been all over the world, this beer is the best I have had soo far, so try it and judge for yourself."
""
""
""
""
"Kinda thin for a DIPA. Blondish orange and lighter in color than other examples from this category. Hoppy, citrusy, but no heft. Not too bitter, a little sweet. Left me wondering if the server had poured the wrong selection. After being reassured, I tried to evaluate it fairly, but I couldn't help but feel a little cheated."
"O-Very good imperial Ipa. Very enjoyable and delivers. Highly drinkable and the 9.6% abv is masked brilliantly. For me personally it does not bring anything new to the imperial ipa genre of beer but is done very well."

"It looked aite, it smelled aite, it came wrapped up in a pretty bottle... but like Raulsky's prom date, what a let down! I mean, it smelled like Britney Spears 2001, but tasted like Britney 2013. Deceiving, deceiving, deceiving! Don't get Raul wrong; if Britney gave Raul a lil something something today, he wouldn't complain - but it still wouldn't be like the """Hit Me Baby One More Time""" edition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyway, Dorado pours a slightly hazy orange with a large head. The aroma has a huge caramel malt that lurks beneath sticky, fruity hops. The taste immediately assaults with a big hop and caramel malt, which eventually yields to a nice, fruity hop aftertaste. Not very bitter, but still full of hop flavor. The mouthfeel is full and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, Dorado is a solid DIPA. Nothing world-class like Sculpin, but it's really a tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent. A bit sweet and therefore starts falling out of the DIPA category. Worth a shot either way though, might be a good brew for getting someone into this style as it is smoother than most, more balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty decent, looks fantastic, a little too peppery/astringent. Definitely good, but not as good as the appearance and aroma led me to hope for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was very surprised to see this on the shelf during a recent trip to my local Whole Foods. Ballast Point does hoppy beers very well, but this beer gets a mixed review from me. The aroma is world class, full of hoppy goodness. The hop flavors are prominent and excellent, with contributions of citrus, tropical, and pine varieties. The downfall of this beer is that there is an alcohol flavor beyond what I consider acceptable. Many big beers have an alcohol warmness about them, but this is more of a rubbing alcohol astringency. I don't want to overstate that aspect, because this is still a decent beer with phenomenal qualities. I will probably grab another bottle in the future to see if my palate was partly to blame tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Well-behaved for its size, Dorado does well to pick its battles. Rather than pursuing more of everything, it focuses on resinous citrus qualities amidst a restrained backbone."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ballast Point has made some great IPAs and this is certainly up there. A unique taste and a very citrus forward west coast like IPA. I'm pleased but could use a bit less alcohol."
"O - Pine heavy, which is a nice change of pace from the classic citrus-forward west coast DIPA. Nice drinkability."
""
""
"Pours a nice gold with a rising head and sticky lacing. Smells floral and fruity. Some bitter hops come through . The taste is like the smell on steroids, very floral, almost perfumey. As the beer warms the floral notes become more pronounced. Feels rich and smooth and has a lingering hoppy finish. Nice IPA hat I hope they make a lot of."
""
""
"o - Overall a nice beer, though the taste is definitely on the malty side from a DIPA. Definitely doesn't taste like it is almost 10% ABV. Nose is nice and has some decent hops to it, but when I'm looking for a DIPA I want it hoppier and not as malty. A good beer but can't see myself going for it often when I can get Sculpin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is a really, really solid, kinda classic, American Double IPA. To me, this is what I think of when I think of the style—dank, citrusy, a healthy dose of bitterness but with good hop flavor, a solid but not heavy malt backbone, and a great feel and appearance. A lot of DIPAs have been doing all flavor and aroma with no bitterness lately, but this feels more like a classic example that does all three solidly, if none of them exceptionally. Very well-rounded, very well-put together."
""
""
""
"There are good aromas and flavors but it just doesn't pop like such a huge beer should. It is still pretty awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If this was available locally, I would be buying it regularly."
""
""

"O - one of the most bitter DIPAs I've had in recent memory. Weak aroma. Uninteresting flavor. Not my thing. I enjoyed Sculpin quite a bit more. Won't drink this one again."
""
"Nah. I'll take the Sculpin over this anyday."
""
"Overall - I'm not a big fan of pine-forward IPAs, and this is one of the stronger """pInePAs""" I've had. So much potential for a multi-layered flavor profile, stifled by the sheer dominance of the pine character. This is a well-crafted beer, but it's not my bag."
""
"O: Dorado rubs my taste buds the wrong way. It's mainly the alcohol. This is coming in far too hot for my liking."
"O- huge beer, huge hops very good, booze is definitely present, it's a very good dipa"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber with one finger thick dense white head, settling to a thin ring with spotty lacing. Smell: grapefruit blast, rindy, slightly sweet and alcoholic. Taste: grapefruit, sugary pale malt, apricot, alcohol, herbal finish. Sugary, drying finish. Good, will be picking up more of this one."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Can definitely feel the Ballast Point IPA roots here. Not an elite DIPA but certainly worth a shot."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well done, maintaining an IPA feel for 10% is rare and this does it well. Plenty of hops, low sweetness and just the right amount of malt backbone. Glad I finally got to try this long-time want."

"Hazy peach colour, one finger of white head, moderate lacing. Smell is all out orange and tangerine initially, lots of fruity hops, grapefruit and just a hint of malt sweetness but make no mistake this is a one sided hop attack. Taste starts out with a slight sweet malt followed by lots of citrusy hops, orange and grapefruit, big dry bitterness throughout, fruity finish. light carbonation and medium body, lightly oily feel. Such an easy drinking DIPA, the bomber was finished with great ease and something I would welcome in my glass anytime."

"O: Good stuff. Not the best DIPA I've ever had, but certainly worth having. I'd buy it again if the price were right."
""

"O-definitely a kick in the mouth, strong IPA. I'd suggest you go out and try this, but make sure to share this bottle. If you don't share it, you'll be enjoying this for awhile. it's a slow drinker. the flavors are good, but maybe just a bit too extreme to be a really enjoyable beer."
"O - Definitely something I would recommend to hop heads and a solid brew from Ballast Point in the DIPA style. Love the tropical & citrus notes on this one in the aroma and flavor profile. This was a refreshing and enjoyable to say the least."

"Pithy grapefruit and that's the end of the story. Not the beast that is Sculpin. Maltier than it's half-brother and that makes even less sense. Maybe hyper fresh this is something else, but there was something missing overall."
"This is nicely hoppy, and the sheer quantity of grapefruit in this is nothing short of astounding. Honestly, this reminds me of eating a grapefruit with a spoon (with some sugar sprinkled on top). I'll have to have this again sometime, perhaps when it is in a can..."
""
""
""
"Clear golden orange. The head is more of a slim, milky ring, but leaves attractive, drippy patches of lacing on the glass. Thick, pulpy, juicy citrus aromas with a sting of alcohol...kind of one dimensional, but nice. Heavy, bright hoppiness hits the tongue with a little booze as well. Bitter citrus, pine needle greenness, pale malt, and a slight honey-like sweetness. A pretty straightforward blast of happy hops. There's an almost creaminess to the body and a lingering bitterness. Not anything amazing, but certainly worth a glass."

"Pours a nice apricot ale with a central dome and rim of light tan foam. Smells of caramel, honeydew, resin, tangerines, some pineapple and honey. Nice nose. Flavor is sweet with plenty of toffee, resin, grapefruit, tangerine again and some mango. I like the flavor. Medium body on light syrup with moderate carb and an off dry finish. I like this beer. I am surprised by this beer (for no real reason)"

"Overall pretty good. Pretty much expected for a big DIPA from west coast, tasty, nice booze kick but drinkable, a nice malty balance that really comes into play and keeps the bitterness from exploding, and a nice hop bill that brings nice flavors and aromas but is missing that nice tropical fruit and subtleties of a great IPA or APA."
""
""
"A great DIPA - great balance of complex hop and malt flavors, but perhaps the ABV could be kept in check more. It veers on the distracting at times."

"A solid West Coast DIPA, not the best or even close, but I would have this again."

"O. This is a beautiful citrusy ipa. Extremely flavorful. So unique"

"O/D-Not what I was expecting, and it is by no means in the same category as Sculpin, but it's definitely pretty unique. 'Menthol hops' have been added to my reviewing acumen after tasting this beer. Not my style of DIPA; too malty and I don't love the hop profile. I respect the brew for what it is. It isn't my style, but I can see why it is so highly regarded. Still, I am so happy to have tried Dorado."

"The taste is whoa!! So bitter and hop- forward! Much tingly pine and some resin. Pepper is there. Great even though the alcohol is well detectable in this one. The spiciness of the hops was blended very well with the malt and there's an earthy dry, warming finish. Astringent yet it all works for me.  "
""
"O: If these are actually El Dorado hops, I want more! A great beer, highly recommended to all. Will have again. Drinkable and delicious."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this fairly limited release. I had one when it was just a couple of days old and I don't think this has changed much from then till now. It does have some candied malt characteristics but this is one of those West Coast hop bombs all the way. Get your hands on this if you can. A must try."
""
""
"O: a very solid and delicious DIPA. very nice flavors and west coast all the way. I can't say enough about this beer, if you find it and like hops you should buy it."

"Medium body and well carbonated. Easy to drink given its abv. An interesting beer, but not too memorable."

"22oz bottle with a Best Before Date of 071313. Pours a golden orange with a half inch of head. Lots of sticky lacing. Tropical fruits and sweet citrus aroma. Some piney hops too. The taste is alot like the aroma. Tropical fruits and orange peel. Pine more towards the end. Actually, the nose had more fruit than pine but I'd say the taste has more pine than tropical fruits. Resinous wih an oily mouthfeel. Not too much alcohol taste. Took me a long time to get to try this one but it was worth the wait. Overall, worth seeking out."
""
"O: Great flavor but a bit boozy in taste and feel. Glad I tried this one though."
"A little disappointed. Maybe the bottle was old, or perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for this one, but it tasted much more like an American Barley Wine rather than a Double IPA. Still tasty though."
"Shared by cmrillo during BRoss242’s send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, wood, fruit, sweet alcohol, and pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, fruit, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I was really surprised to find the pine aspect going on in this one like I experienced coming from a West Coast IPA. Isn’t that a joke for us East Coast guys? But all joking aside, this was brew was pretty nice and easy drinking. The fruit aspect was definitely the saving grace as the pine would have completely dominated otherwise. Definitely worth the try if you get the chance and I’m still surprised that I haven’t ticked it before."

"A smooth and delicious double IPA. A lighter feel than I typically prefer but great mix of flavors and well concealed alcohol. Despite the hefty price tag I'd certainly buy it again. Highly recommended. "
"O: I enjoy this more than I enjoy sculpin (which I really enjoy), so this is a win in my books. I would love to see this in six packs, but of course that will never happen."

"Bright and bold DIPA by Ballast Point, really delivers a blast of hoppy aroma that remains bright and lively. I was hoping for a double Sculpin, instead this is more of a stock west coast ipa hop profile and an alcohol whipping to the palate."

"A tasty, hoppy DIPA that will satisfy a need for a hop fix, but not the most layered of Ballast Point's offerings. I would never pass this one up, but it's strange that their more easily-attainable and lighter Sculpin is clearly better."
"O: Pretty good but not up to the level of other BP IPAs, and certainly not up to the level of the former incarnation of this beer's sterling reputation. On the plus side, I had no idea this was 10% while drinking it; on the minus side, I probably didn't need a 10% DIPA."
""
""
"O: this is a pretty good double ipa, I would deffinatly take this over a sculpin... There is a serious amount of hops going in here and the balance is done quite nicley IMO. Nicley rounded while still maintaining an agreesive hoppyness or becoming on overly sweet malt bomb."
""

"love to get this on tap somewhere in NorCal -- 8.99 for the bomber? but double jack is only 7.99...."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma has some candy and resin hops, with some biscuit malt thrown in. The flavor is very similar. I get some bitter pine and resin from the hop notes, as well as some brown sugar and orange citrus notes. There is a good amount of malty sweetness, which is mixed with some strong hop flavor and a medium amount of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a very hazy, golden orange color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is immediately tropical..pineapple and fresh honeydew. Hints of citrus, but mostly tropical fruit. The hops are quite subdued for a DIPA from San Diego. More malty aroma than I expected. I guess we'll leave the west-coast style for the Russian Rivers, the Alpines, and the Green Flashes. Taste is just as it smells...sweet tropical fruits with a hop profile that is blended strongly with sweet malt and hops. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and smooth. Drinkability is high, as there is not much boozy flavor/aroma to this beer. Overall, very different from some of their other hoppy offerings. Solid beer though."
""

"I love Ballast Point, Sculpin is one of my favorite beers. I had high hopes for this one, but it was a big disappointment. It was very bitter, bitter not in a good way. My friiend had some and he had same feelings as me. We drank as much as we could, but ultimately this was a drain pour."
"I was really stoked to see this on a recent trip to NC and it did not disappoint. It had been a while since I'd had a great IPA and the style was starting to slide down my list of favorites. This was just what I needed to restore my faith in the hop. Easily one of the best beers I've had in a while, and the best IPA I've had in probably a year or more. Highly recommended."
"A terrific DIPA."
"Overall, not a hop bomb but a well balanced dipa."
""
"Overall: this beer fresh is extremely enjoyable but it is slow drinking. This will make any hophead happy."
"This is a decent, balanced beer with solid flavor. The alcohol is well masked and the hop character complements the bready malt character. This was a great share from Jim."

"Bottled on July 18th.Poured into an imperial nonic a clear medium to full golden with a great looking sticky two finger white head atop.Tropical fruit and grassy hop aromas dominate,mild alcohol sweetness as well.Minty-leafy and overripe fruit-like hop flavors with a big shot of sweet alcohol on the palate,the hops win out barely over the brash alcohol in the finish.As I drink more a real sharp grapefruit rind flavor comes into play.This is big and brash but the hops win out over the sweet alcohol wich can't be said for to many of the style,a great DIPA."
""
""
"Pure heaven. So much tropical fruit and not a touch of detectable alcohol.Same fruit flavors that are on the nose pass over the tongue. Sweet sticky honey and caramel like flavors only compliment the hops in the most amazing ways possible. Clean bitterness makes the beer not overly sweet. Lingering caramel covered tropical fruit in the mouth. The sweetness is offset by the bitterness so perfectly leaving nothing but delicious and balanced flavors in the mouth. The beer even has a slightly tannic quality. So incredibly balanced and smooth. Dangerously smooth! Why isn't this available in NJ year round and in 6 pack or 4 pack form!? I would pay 20 dollars a 6 for this! Pure brewing perfection."
""
"Will defintely seek this out again."
"Overall a well crafted, nicely balanced, *big* DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a big, juicy citrus and tropical bomb nicely balanced with bready malts and sugary caramel. Moderately bitter but nothing too astringent. Very easy drinking. The 10% abv is expertly hidden. This just made the list as one of my top DIPAs. A must try!"
""
"O: HMMM i want another!"
"Actually gets better as it warms. Would pair well with spicy food."
""
"O: Had high hopes due to Sculpin, but just wasn't really a fan of this one."
""
"Awesome!"
"O - Being a lover of Double/Imperial IPA's this one is """decent", but I prefer Sculpin. Compared to many other big IPA's from the West Coast this one is sitting in the middle of the pack. For the price that was paid, I wouldn't procure another bottle but glad I was able to finally try this. I apologize for this review because I really love the beers from Ballast Point, they are very talented at their craft. As a lover of DIPA/Imperial IPA's, this one is """meh""" IMO. Today is July 24th and this bottle is dated """Enjoy by 6/22/13", just an FYI if anyone is reading this review. This is a beer I would love to try right around bottling time."

""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, and some nice tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a light malt finish. There is a somewhat high hop bitterness on the palate that lingers after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell that is quite tasty as well."
""
"Overall a superb DIPA!"
""
"This one ain't kidding around with the bitterness. There is not much sweetness in the malt to balance this one out and it's bitter from start to finish. It does mellow out with time and as it warms, but there really isn't much complexity to this. Lots of great DIPA's in CA. This is not one of them, unfortunitately."
""
"Overall: Was hesitant about the price tag in PA, but went for it and I'm glad I did. I might honestly call this my favorite offering from Ballast yet, and I love Sculpin. Not for the introductory DIPA drinker because this will knock you down with its potency. A better (IMO) version of Devil Dancer. Seek out if you dare!"
"O: Getting bored of Ballast Point beers at $9. They don't stand out enough to justify the price now that so many others have stepped up their own offerings. This would have been more exciting and justifiable at the price point 3 years ago."
"O - A big IPA, but it's either past it's prime or just not that great."
"O. This is a great DIPA. There are others I prefer, but this is very good."

"Finally snagged a few bombers at my local WF. Pours a beautiful sunset orange with a nice inch thick white cap that leaves nice curtains of lace as I drink down. The nose is very fresh hops and citrus fruits, red grapefruit pulp to be exact. The Flavors follow through on the palate, gobs of juicy citrus flavors from the obvious red grapefruits to orange peel and lemons, definitely a citrus lovers DIPA. The finish is very nice, leaving tell tale notes of bitter citrus and resiny pine from the massive hopping. Overall a very well made DIPA that I will drink gladly again."
"The beer is mildly hazy and appears a sunset orange color. Half inch of white head. The aroma offers citrus, hops, alcohol. Tropical fruits dominate the flavor with alcohol presence notable throughout. While I would consider this a hop forward beer, the malt body definitely plays a major role. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Lingering notes of alcohol, tropical fruit. Overall, pretty good. It would be better if the alcohol was hidden more gracefully."
"From the 22 oz bottle bought at Liticker's in Ocean Beach."

"O- A really awesome DIPA, the hops are big and bold but are really well balanced by equally delicious malt, it's pretty damn drinkable for 10% ABV, this is a great beer that I'm glad they bottled again, I'd like to see this around more regularly."

"Chewy full body with a blast of dry, earthy bitterness that is excellently countered by sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes along with a pale malt backbone. Sticky, dry pine needle followed by hints of pineapple, mango, grapefruitand orange peel. Biscuity malt backbone provides subtle balance without taking away from the hops at all. The ABV is noticeable with subtle heat in the finish but it's really well masked considering the strength. Just an outstanding hop bomb of a beer."

"I rarely like to give a beer a 4 rating across-the-board but this it hit it at all points. A little disappointing, similar to my Sculpin disappointment, but my real appreciation goes to their Big Eye IPA - their best beer by far to my knowledge."
"Drink- A very tasty beer. I'm glad I finally was able to get this. Big, thick, deep citrus."
"A touch too much heat for my taste but still a great DIPA with some real nice use of hops. Would def recommend and can't wait for bottles to come out again."
"This beer pours out as a really nice copper color with a thick creamy looking head. The lacing was pretty thick on the glass too. The smell of the beer is really hopped up and had big aromas of citrus and pine. The taste of the beer was also intense just like the nose, really good hop flavors tingle the tongue on every sip. The mouthfeel is a little bitey but still remained drinkable. Overall it's a damn good brew."
"O - Overall I tend to drink this one whenever possible, great different tasting IPA. Citrus kinda IPA."
"Overall: not impressed. I was expecting a bigger Sculpin and got this instead. The keg was fairly recently tapped so either the beer has sat in distributor hell for a long time or this beer is terrible. Given that the only Ballast Point I've had that I enjoyed was Sculpin, I might be inclined to believe it is the latter. Avoid. Cheers!"
"*edit* I had another glass of this new batch on tap at Churchill's a couple weeks later and it was awful, like D+ awful: cloying, medicinal, and face melting booze. I'm not sure what's going on with this batch. I didn't take notes but I could hardly finish my glass. This review is from the keg I had the first day they tapped it at Old Grove which was awesome."
"Final thought - Ballast point makes good IPA"
"O - Wouldn't even get a taster of this let alone a pint. This is a classic example of needing to dump a batch - if Dog Fish can handle it then BP should buck up too. A sad day."
"O: All in all, I'm a bit disappointed this time around with the taste in this brew. Perhaps it's just me...If this was the intended taste that the brewery was going for, then perhaps it's just not quite for me. Of course, there's always the possibility that somewhere along the distribution path, this beer changed...Regardless, I have to say that this isn't bad beer...It's simply not along the lines of my taste for Imperial IPA. I will continue to celebrate the brews of Ballast Point and suggest that YOU be the judge..."
"Overall, I do not like this beer. It becomes syrupy and cloying from all the malt. Almost reminds me of a barleywine. Way too sweet for my tastes. The booze is also pretty strong which covers up whatever other flavors there might be."
"Overall, this seems quite different from older batches of Dorado, possibly for the better. The hop character has shifted more toward tropical fruit flavors, which are highlighted by greater sweetness and alcohol. I'm really liking this batch, though I seem to be in the minority."
"I've decided this 2XIPA is a lovely honey gold, but not as opaque as honey, more translucent. Almost a full 2 finger head, and dense. Lacing, yup it's there. The hops On the nose are full of herbs and pine. It smells sticky and earthy. There is some balance here, but sadly sweet sticky hops wine in the end. A simple basic malt bill can't stand uP to the hop bill Ballast point uses. The beer is very piney, herbaceous, and slightly cloying. I'd say dorado is a bit syrupy in my mouth, but fairly regular for the style. A fine ale to be certain, but it's hard for a 2XIPA to stand tall when the likes of Pliny and ghandi-bot are around."
"Dark amber color with half a finger of foam. Head recedes rapidly leaving a small ring around the outside of my glass. No lacing at all portends that all is not right in Denmark. Smell is of sweet malt and dank hops. No floral or citrus qualities are discernible. I'm getting a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. The taste is... Well, first and foremost it's sweet. Overly sweet. This is followed by a wave of bitterness and a sweet juicy finish. The term """medicinal""" is the first adjective that comes to mind. It reminds me of the cough syrup I never wanted to take when I was a kid. Speaking of syrup, the feel is thick and syrupy with a low level of carbonation. Overall this was a disappointment. I remember this being much better when I had it a year or so ago. Brighter and much less sweet. As is, this beer is not undrinkable, I finished my pint, but it was not very enjoyable."
"(As strange as this sounds for a DIPA, this beer seems like a perfect candidate for aging. If I'd bought bombers instead of a growler, I'd cellar the remainder.)"
"D - Nicely drinkable, the high ABV is well masked."
"I easily finished this glass, but that was enough for me. Nice double over all."
"Drinkability: One bomber should about do it for me. Nothing sneaky about this beer--just good."
"*As a note, this site has the ABV listed as 9.6%, the brewery had the ABV posted as 10.6%. I don't know if that batch was stronger than usual or if that was the norm."
"D: Pretty easy drinker. A really solid dipa."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, smooth, chewy, and warming."
"Overall, just a standard DIPA. Lots of bitterness and nothing else. Hop heads will love it. If you are looking for something else, keep on looking."
"D- Solid- absolutely an everyday DIPA."
"Drinkability: The high abv is a set back in this department."
"The crispness of this brew is really impressive, but is really the only redeeming quality in my opinion. No where close to Sculpin IMO, so why should I have this when I can have that."
"D - This IIPA wasn't bad...great nose from the dry hopping and pretty balanced until the finish...my only complaint is the alcohol started showing through as the beer got warmer"
"D - Drinkability is fairly high on this one. I would like the hops to come thru a tiny bit more in the taste but still an excellent cask offering."
"Hazy amber color. Aroma was heavy notes of floral, perfume, grapefruit, caramel, grain, mild fruit and a hint of grassy notes. Over the palate came oily and citrus liken feel combined with notes of perfume, grapefruit and good counter toasted malt and caramel. Full bodied with an average carbonation and dry oily texture. Heavy bitter and good counter sweet flavor. Lingering bitter dry perfume like floral finish. One of my favorite BP brews..."
"D: If you like hop bombs, this is your drinkable DIPA. Makes me think of the DIPA version of Blind Pig, even though this is two different brewers. If you enjoy the more balanced DIPA such as PtE like myself, this probably won't make your favorite list."
"D - Yeah, I could drink this, but I'd like a little less sweetness on it, and a little less alcohol bite."
"M/D - medium bodied, a bit thicker than i expected. The hops aren't the most dominant while the malt and pepper come through equally"
"Initially I'm troubled because there is no head. A very thin white ring only around the edge of the glass, no foam covering the surface of the beer. The aroma is fine and good. Nothing out of the ordinary. Big American hops and a little bit of booze. The taste is good, I'll just say good. Big resinous hops, light malt and a fair amount of alcohol. This is a nice beer. Hits the style on the nose although it's a little bit boozier than I like. The mouthfeel was average for the style and the drinkability was better than I thought it was going to be after the first few sips. Nothing to write home about but a beer I'd certainly be inclined to try on tap."
"Pours a nice golden amber color, with a good finger or so of cloud-like white foam. Nice hoppy aromas going on here, pine, grapefruit, maybe a little tangerine. More good hoppiness on the palate, pine and citrus mostly, balanced nicely by the sweet toffee/caramel malt flavors. Another good example of the west coast IPA style."
"D: It's rather drinkable considering the high amount of alcohol content, although I can't see myself having more than one of these in a single sitting."
"Had at the dipa fest. Suffers from great expectations because of their other ipas, otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this."
"Booziness prevalent upon warming...somewhat of a chore to make it through as the beer becomes increasingly chewy"
"Hard to imagine this is the 11% they told us. Mouthfeel wise it seems like it is 11%, but it's quite drinkable despite the thick and oily mouthfeel. An absolutely please to drink."
"Pours a dark brown with a white head and a little bit of lacing. Smell is a lot of citrus (mostly grapefruit) hops with a bit of a floral character coming in as well. Taste is very similar with a strong bitterness and only a slight backing of caramel malt. Moderate body with good carbonation. Very drinkable, especially for a double IPA. Intriguing hop presence that I thoroughly enjoyed, perhaps more so than Sculpin."
"Overall I have wanted to try this beer for some time and I was not disappointed. Now if only I can get this to Mexico and try it with some Dorado sashimi caught fresh from the sea."
"This beer poured from the bottle to reveal a light golden color with a fair amount of bubbles from the carbonation. There was a thick foamy head with a lot of lacing. The aroma was strong and earthy pine. The mouthfeel was very nice and buttery. The first taste is smooth, but becomes progressively hoppy in the mid tastes and it finishes with a moderately strong, but not overpowering floral hoppiness. This is a good beer, but a little pricey compared to others in the category."
"D - This is a full bodied beer, with rich mix of hops and caramel, it would go great with chicken or a light fish."
"Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is alright. This beer is not the immediate lovefest you might expect after tasting the Sculpin, a beer where they used more accessible flavor and aroma hops. This beer is not my thing but definitely sets itself apart from other DIPAs. By the way, every time I burp I taste buttered popcorn."
"drinkable and tasty beer i really enjoyed it. Highly quaff-able offering."
" This stuff is awesome. I had it on tap and hope that the bottle version is as good if I can find it."
"Very fine Double IPA. The fruitiness was amazing. The grapefruitiness wasnot alone, you could tastes hints of mango and tropical type sweet/sour fruits. The flavor was overall very balanced for such a high alcohol beer. If I see this again I will buy this again."
"Nice DIPA I think my bottle had a touch of age on it and it drank wonderfully."
"The color is copper/amber, dark, hardly any head with a not-overly-aggressive pour. Smell is unmistakably hoppy with high alcohol content. I was really looking forward to trying this brew. Taste was hoppy and burns something serious. The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied, slick and oily. Drinkability was poor on this on, in my opinion, in that the burn in the throat on the aftertaste is overbearing. I was a little disappointed on this in that aspect. Just not one of my favorites. Give her a whirl and see what you think by all means. It's worth a pint."
"No head, but partially because it was full to the rim. Color was a slightly hazy medium-amber. Nose left no question that this was a DIPA. It was smokin' with hops and burned some nose hairs on its way up the pipe. Mouthfeel was medium with a crisp, citrusy bitterness on the tongue. Finish had a peppery after taste. Phew!"
"This double ipa is quite drinkable indeed. It surpasses Mojo Risin' on the aspect of double ipa drinkability. Each glass will beckon for its successor. In my humble opinion, this surpasses my prior Double IPA Favorite (Great Divide Hercules) and is now at the top of my list."
"All in all this is almost a hybrid between Pliny the Elder and 90 minute IPA - really impressive!"
"This DIPA, with its light body, high ABV and easy drinking properties makes for a dangerous drinking partner. The aftertaste is a little distracting, but ultimately a highly drinkable brew."
"This is a drinkable DIPA. Lots of citrus hops, but not quite on the level of PTE. Ballast Point makes a great beer, but this isn't as good as its IPA."
"D: An okay DIPA. Personally, I found it a little light and the odd aftertaste was distracting. Otherwise, some interesting tropical flavors going on here."
"The taste is a fruit salad. Very little of the pine or earthy bitterness at first. It starts sweet (maybe too sweet for some, but I love a good balanced DIPA). Grapefruit and mango take an unmistakeable, smooth lead. The fruit flavors are allowed to linger for a while before they are gradually relieved by the bitter pine that slowly builds towards the finish. A truly well balanced beer that allows each flavor to shine at different points. If you like Dreadnaught, this will appeal."
"Another example of a great beer from a great brewery"
"D: Incredible! Heather and I were super impressed by the balance of this west coast DIPA. Another excellent Ballast Point beer!"
"This beer is frighteningly drinkable considering the intense flavor characteristics and bighearted abv. It's tasty to the point that you overlook such things that would slow you down in a beer with less to offer. Great Brew!"
"An exemplary example of the American Double IPA, hopheads should be aiming their sites on this beer."
"Having had Sculpin first, it was hard for me to keep myself from forming an opinion about Dorado before even opening it. On one hand, I was excited about having a DIPA from Ballast Point, and was also excited that my friends at Green's had some bottles at their store. On the other hand, I was already expecting to be let down, because I couldn't imagine many beers stacking up to Sculpin. In the end, I was quite pleased with Dorado. It may not be Sculpin, but it's still damn good."
"Bottle: Poured a light clear orangey color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and grapefruit hops is one-dimensional but still very interesting. Taste is also dominated by grapefruit hops with loads of great floral notes and light bitter finish. Malt is present thought doesn't play a big role in the final taste. Body is about average with good carbonation and no signs of alcohol. Well done for a West Coast IIPA."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and clean. The malt backbone in this beer is barely evident and provides only a touch of caramel instead of the resinous malty stickiness that some DIPAs have (and this one might have if let sit...luckily this is perfectly fresh). As mentioned before, the lack of evidence of any alcohol makes this one dangerously drinkable. The balance...or lack thereof...makes this a dream for a big hop head."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable in the sense that I keep wanting more and more, and that makes it very dangerously drinkable at this ABV. That means that more than two portions a night is simply not going to happen. However, this is also an interesting and complex DIPA that I'll revisit again in the future now that it is available in PA."
"D: This is a nicely balanced DIPA, one that I will pick up again."
"The mouthfeel is quite nice, maybe slightly over carbed, but not bad at all. Drinkability is decent, more of a sipper than anything else, but well worth sipping on."
"D: Well balanced enough to drink pretty easily, but the ABV is high enough to make it a sipper."
"Good beer. Prefer Sculpin. Certainly wouldn't pass is it up though."
"Overall- Slightly boozy but it goes down smooth and is an easy DIPA to polish off."
"Poured into a tulip glass a clear orange with a one finger white head that really didn't last long. Minimal lacing. The scent isn't very strong for this style. But what is there is a fresh floral scent. The hop taste isn't very strong either. But the balance with a rather strong sweet malt back end of the palatte. It also leaves a nice sweet layer on the lips"
"notes/overall impression- great nose, sweet flavor, very drinkable, nice balance with a bitter hop component, great example, top shelf beer, super smooth example and an easy drinking double"
"The beer is clear, pale golden color, with 2 fingers of lacable foam. The aroma is strong with hops, floral and citrusy, lots of grapefruit and maybe a hint of honey. This beer is is almost sticky with resinous sap, the taste is bitter with citrus notes. The aftertaste is so bitter it's almost acrid. Still tasty enough that this isn't a negative attribute. Drinkability might be mitigiated by some slight alcohol flavor. This is a very good west coast style DIPA, recommended."
"Medium body with a crisp carbonation. Great bitter finish leaves a coat of resiny hop oils on the palate. Impressive stuff."
"This is a great DIPA and I'd put in in the top 3 I've had in its class. Somewhat limited, this one has been on my radar for some time now and I was very pleased to pick up a bottle from my beer guy in the city this past weekend. Unfortunately he did not win the lottery for Sculpin which is also hard to come by and very good apparently. Oh well until next time hopefully. Get it if you can!"
"Well, maybe awesome isn't my only comment. It pours a hazy golden yellow and has that unique blend and balance of intense hops, strong alcohol while remaining smooth and drinkable. I am getting giddy just thinking about it. I could session this beer or just relax with a bomber. The only problem it doesn't come in a 12pk."
"Although this was way overpriced, it was a great beer. I wish Ballast Point was more readily available on the East Coast."
"Dorado is strong and flavorful but very drinkable. This is one of my favorites San Diego beers."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass a crisp pale orange with a nice off-white head. Aroma is a nice amount of citrus hops and sweet malts with just a hint of pine. The taste a wonderful complex blend of citrus and pine hops with nice sticky caramel malts and a very nice lingering dry bitter finish. The beer is a bit on the heavy side, but it still very easy-drinking. This is a very enjoyable DIPA, much better on-tap than when I had it from the bottle."
"Light golden lager poured into a snifter at the Rose n Crown pub in Palo Alto. Citrus hops, pine, grapefruit, and lemon dominate the nose. Very well balanced brew has a mild bitterness that lingers. Caramel malts are present though throughout though but mostly detected mid-way through the taste. Beer is rather light bodied and easy to polish off despite the ABV. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel goes from crisp to soft. Initial reaction was that the mouthfeel was a bit light, but became more rich with each assault of hoppy goodness on the palate. Drinkability is good. You could enjoy this until the high abv kicks in."
"I would absolutely search this one out again!"
"Pours a nice golden amber color into my DFH pint glass, has a one finger head that is full, and just between creamy and fizzy. Leaves medium lacing down my glass, nice carbonation bubbles rise throughout the beer, a nice looking ale. Smells and tastes of great hops, a perfect blend of citrus and piney hops, has a pretty much perfect balance of hops in the nose and taste. There is also some other fruity/sweet tastes that I cannot really identify but are definitely something I have never picked up in a double IPA before. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit creamy with great carbonation and a good coating of hoppy flavor for the mouth to enjoy after each sip. Drinkability is good, great taste, none of the 9% alcohol is picked up in the taste. All in all a really good double IPA hop bomb that I wish was not a limited release."
"Very tasty and drinkable, many thanks to barleywinefiend for sending this gem coast to coast."
"Pale golden slight copper colored hue with a nice sized white head, billows up the rim of my Sam Adams Boston Lager crazy balloon shaped glass. Forms fine even lacing and definitely settles rather quickly. Aroma for the most part is upfront hoppiness with pine cone, citrus as in grapefruit in this case. A touch of herbal kind bud pungency as well this is one hoppy creation out of So Cal, god I miss living out there and drinking beers like this on the daily. Flavor hits up front with sugary sweet and puckering bitter notes, much like a Green Flash DIPA it bites you with hop burp and sugary bitterness it's referred to as man candy in some podcasts from the Pittsburgh area. Even a bit onion or garlic with the type of bitterness going on that's a bit of a turn off, overall massively bitter and carbonation is even body is moderate nothing to offend here but then again nothing that thrills me completely. Drinkability overall is quality a beer I will quaff when graced with it's presence, scarcity is good but I would be better off with a six pack of 12 oz sculpin IPAs."
"A VERY well done West Coast Representation of the style."
"A top-of-the-line DIPA from California, one of the better ones I have had."
"Pours a nice bright golden, with lively head and good retention and lacing. Nose is pine, grapefruit, and a sticky-resiny-earthy aroma. Taste adds a touch of malty sweetness, bubble gum, with a protracted bitterness. The alcohol is masked reasonably well but is detected on the aftertaste. I'd like this beer more if the finish were crisper. As to drinkability, I don' think the flavor requires the high alcohol. You could do this beer just as well in the 5-7% range: why pile the alcohol on, unnecessarily? Overall a delightfully fresh drink that is an excellent example of a West Coast IPA."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a nice white head. Nose is wonderful, floral west coast hops dominate. Taste is grapefruit forward, peach and melon back balanced nicely with a good malt backbone. Finish is very clean. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall drinkability is near perfect. This is the easiest drinking 9% abv brew I have had in awhile!"
"D: About average drinkability for the style. I don't think I'd want two of these, given the bitterness and ABV."
"Drinkability: It drinks its ABV, which I thought was 9.1, not 9.6, but it's almost splitting hairs at that point. Proud to be the first to review on cask, and I'd imagine tomorrow reviewing this beer out of the bottle I've had in the fridge to see how they compare."
"Not being able to get fresh PtE in Mass. this is a pretty good substitute for me (not that this is really available either - just got lucky on this one). Wish I could get this one more easily. Still not quite up to Pliny, but very, very close for me. Great beer!"
"Poured into a tulip glass a clear orange with a one finger white head that really didn't last long. Minimal lacing. The scent isn't very strong for this style. But what is there is a fresh floral scent. The hop taste isn't very strong either. But the balance with a rather strong sweet malt back end of the palatte. It also leaves a nice sweet layer on the lips. Thanks to Andrew K for the bottle."
"D: Drinkable, but pretty heavy. Not for novices."
"D: One of the more drinkable DIPA's I've had, but still pretty heavy duty stuff. The occasional alcohol hotness doesn't really help. It'd be tough to handle much more than a bomber before the ol' palate gets numbed. Yet overall, enjoyable!"
"D: ABV is reasonable for the style but the big alcohol flavor and feel takes a bitmoff the drinkability."
"D-I could drink this all day long. This is an outstanding, delicious beer."
"Picked this up today for a nice sunday afternoon refresher. Great clear golden color, big 2 finger foamy white head that sticks and leaves a ton of lacing behind. Smell is straight up hop destruction. Grapefruit, peach, lemon, mango; all the delicious fruits you could ask for in the nose. Nice malty start dethroned by a king-size hop blast. Pine hops and grapefruit bitterness and some citrus zest. The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky: delicious. This is an excellent IPA."
"D: An amazingly drinkable DIPA. Great offering by Ballast Point."
"As far as drinkability goes, it's a good thing I just have this bomber to sit on, because if I was drinking this by the pint on draft, I'd need to call a cab. I would never guess the abv to be as high as it is."
"Top notch DIPA."
"Overall, not very balanced, but a true treat for the hop heads. I'm not necessarily a hop head, but this beer is hard not to like. If you like DIPA, this one is a must have along with summer yulesmith."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and full. Goes down easily with spot on carbonation. This is one easy drinking double IPA. Overall, I found this to be a tasty west coast hop bomb. Not earth shattering for me but damn good and one I would definitely drink again sometime!"
"It's a good DIPA, though it doesn't really stand out by San Diego standards. Glad to try it though."
"This beer is often over shadowed by Sculpin, but it's an excellent brew in its' own right. It doesn't have the same nose, but does have a better mouthfeel. This is damn good beer."
"- Over-drinkable.. seriously... this tastes like a typical IPA... a really good one.... but hides the fact that it is a double for sure... the best sneaker/hidden/don't hold your breath IIPA I have had."
"I love Ballast Point, but this one was a slight letdown. Appearance is great - bright orange color, no haze, off-white head, and laces well. Nose is great with mixed citrus, but a focus towards grapefruit. Palate offers a whollop of both hops and malt, some biscuity caramel flavors in there, but mostly edgy sharp hop bite. Finish is sharp too with a subtle lingering sweetness."
"This beer is certainly drinkable and pleasant; just nothing special. Has a medium/long pine resin finish. This is a good beer but a bit simple all around. Did not meet expectations of a """Robust Series - Limited Release.""" Candidly, perhaps this is just not the producer for me. I've found Ballast Point brews """acceptable""" but I've never been really impressed. Just my opinion."
"I loved this beer but have a hard time classifying it as a DIPA. Either way, Ballast Point never disappoints."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fairly strong carbonation."
"Notes : This is my 1st beer review, so it isn't the most comprehensive or well-informed. But that's why I'm here - to learn. I've been drinking craft beer fairly regularly for the past three years, but only recently decided to try my hand at reviews. I had this bottle sitting around for a special occasion & figured it would be as good a bottle as any with which to start."
"From a bomber to a pint glass, pours a light orange/orange color and produces a pretty big white head. The head seems to want to stick around for quite some time. Leaves good lacing down the glass. The smell right away is hoppy and mainly grapefruity. Very sweet smell. There is a hint of pine but it's not to strong for me. Taste is rather sweet. A little bit of pine hops in the aftertaste but like the smell it isn't very strong and doesn't stick out much. Grapefruit is there as well. Mainly it's sweet taste that dominate this one, but still is pretty hoppy. For higher ABV it's not noticeable, and drinks rather easily which is how I like DIPAs. Going into this one I was kind of expecting a big brother to Sculpin but this one is entirely on it's own and shouldn't be compared to it as both are good in there own rights. Really good beer overall, I'm gonna pick it up again if possible."
"A great DIPA that isn't as harsh as your stereotypical super hopped up beers. Great sweet flavors mixed in with the typical hop bite."
"Overall, this is a great Double IPA. Another Southern California beer that makes me want to take a jetplane out west and live under a brewery. Very nice."
"The taste is mirrors the smell perfectly, and adds some bitter orange. Very acidic and drying, and the malts add some substance to the body. Tastes like a bowl full of bitter citrus fruit. Some lemongrass shows as well. If the Abv wasn't so high, I could drink this every night."
"Notes: Wow! This is the epitome of what West Coast DIPA's are all about. Wall-to-wall hops with a tropical vibe and an intense bitterness that beats the palate into submission. The presence of ethanol, and the heat resulting from it, is the only thing keeping the flavor score from reaching greatness. This is top-shelf!"
"D- A very awesome brew here. Recommended for sure. Easy to drink."
"D- This is a beer I have been waiting for. It picks up everything I like about IPA's and DIPA's and just let's it rip. Perfect beer for someone who needs a big hop bomb but doesn't want it too overly sweet or overly bitter. Perfect hop balance!!!"
"alcohol becomes more prominent in this beer as it warms, but its a very well done double IPA."
"Drinkability: Yet another hoppy winner from Ballast Point. I don't know how they do it, but they have to let up sometime. I've never had any problems with Ballast Point's bitter beers. Even though it's hopped up and little more expensive then their regular offerings, one bottle of this beer is not good enough. If you do choose to buy this beer, then I sure hope you like bitter hops because there's more than enough hops to go around."
"Dorado is a very strong player in Ballast Point's lineup. It's not their best beer, but it's easily one their top 3. I was hoping that they'd capture the same magic that they did with Sculpin, but not quite. Almost. It just lacks a little something special that'd get it there. Why is that? Tough question. Well, personally, I think the alcohol's just a little too noticeable and warm. Small gripe, but there it is. Having said that, Dorado's excellent beer that's just falls a little shy of world class. It really is closer than you might believe. Seek a bottle out. You'll be glad you did."
"Reviewed on 06/21/2009. On draft. Pours a light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of hops oils, citrus, and grapefruit. Flavor is sweet and malty with lots of citrus and grapefruit. It is rather heavy, as is expected with the 9.6% abv, but otherwise very nice."
"But if you quickly drink this you'll be on you ass. 1/3 of the way through the bottle and I can feel it coming on strong. A one beer beer for sure."
"22oz, 9.1% ABV with no date. Poured a murky light orange color with a creme colored head with excellent retention and actually leaves a nice foamy film atop the ale for the remainder of the drink. Great lacing down the glass as well. Huge floral hops fill the nose along with sweet caramel, brown sugar and some faint citrus, which also smells sweet - maybe some pineapple. Huge initial malt character with the first sip - caramel and brown sugar again. Alcohol is very present at first, but is more concealed as the complex hops add character - piny bitterness, pineapple, and a hint of grapefruit, but the malts hold up very well - and more than expected. Finishes bitter, but not overly and actually finishes somewhat sweet. Mouth-feel is full bodied and the hop resins coat the palate very well. At first I wasn't crazy over this one, but it grew on me with each additional sip. Quality Double IPA - west coast style! Full of flavor and uniquely complex."
"this is a nice, """balanced""" example of a west coast DIPA that leans towards the bitter and resinous side of the spectrum, as there is still a good malt backbone to counter it."
"I like their choice of hops. Excelent aroma excellent taste. I recommend all DIPA drinkers give this one a shot. I think you will like it. Look for the two mahi mahis on the front of the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is lighter than expected based on the abv. The bitterness dries out the mouth and leaves behind a sweet, citrusy, juicy feel. The alcohol is barely present making the beer dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability is phenomenal. Drinks lighter than it feels or tastes, bitterness doesn't overwhelm, dry but not harsh, very flavorful. Classic left coast approach done right."
"One of my new favs."
"I found this to be a very enjoyable DIPA from the folks at Ballast Point. Perfect when you're in the mood for a hoppy monster of an IPA."
"This tastes much better cold, right out of the fridge in my opinion. The overall taste just is not doing it for me, although it is indeed good...as it warms the taste becomes more intolerable. The fruits that I'm getting are orange and mango, with a lot of caramel. Not too much grapefruit. Perhaps my bottle is not that fresh."
"D/O: I could easily drink this all the time if it were available. That being said, I don't know if it's hands and fists better than many of the other DIPAs we have access to in SEPA. I think it stacks up quite well even with some of our local offerings (Double Simcoe comes to mind). I missed this on tap at TJs, but I'd like to give it another try with a keg or bottle I knew was absolutely fresh. Regardless of how jaded we've become in this area, this is a truly excellent beer."
"HV"
"D- I think BP makes great beers in general. They happen to make my favorite IPA (Sculpin). I think that they are in the running for my top 3 DIPA's (Expo Hoppiness, Yulesmith).You have to like hops and be in the mood for a DIPA. If you fulfill those prereq's you'll love this beer."
"Overall a top, top notch DIPA that just compliments Sculpin in every way. This is the big brother that will back down from no fight. Great beer, wish I could have it on hand all the time."
"This beer pours clear and bright. It's a light to middling shade for a DIPA with good lacing. The nose is strongly hoppy with a West coast DIPA profile, lots of citrus, some pine and a bit floral. The flavor is actually smoother than expected. I was thinking that this beer would have a strong hop bite, and the hops are definitely there, but the malt is strong, too. The beer does tend to get a tad boozy with malt sweetness, but the tangerine rind hops pull it back from the brink. The feel is smooth with a bit of alcohol, as previously mentioned. If not for the boozy note, it would be an extremely drinkable DIPA. Anyway, Dorado is another strong effort from Ballast Point."
"Wow."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. I can't wait to get my hands on another bottle!"
"Poured a light gold color with a small white head. Nose is wham. Hops and lots of it. Citrus, floral and pine notes. Taste is GREAT. Big citrus, lots of flavor, pine and everything. It was medium bodied and it was so tasty it went down to easy. This IIPA is so hop froward but not obnoxiously as it kept it taste well, well balanced. ABV is well hidden and this beer was a treat to drink for sure and perhaps one if the best IIPA I have ever had."
"Drinkability - Easily a mac daddy of a Double IPA from the west coast wizards at Ballast Point. Not the epic that Sculpin is, but a welcome edition to the family and a great feather in their cap."
"Drinkability is extremely high. This is one of the best beers I have had, and definitely the best DIPA I have ever had. Ballast Point is fast becoming my favorite brewery. Damn! Drink this if you have the means!"
"So yeah, I like this beer. Wish I bought more of it. Perfect example of a west cost DIPA. Seek it out."
"Superb beer. Ballast Point has jumped way up on the radar for me. 4 for 4 so far."
"Glad to see BP has brought this back up to Northern California. It is still as good as it was when I tried it well over a year ago. I still prefer its lighter brother Sculpin, but the other bottle in my fridge won't last long."
"D- Well this was easy to drink, perhaps to easy considering the ABV one should be careful. Either way I need to track down some bottles because I can see myself easily going through 22oz's."
"I recommend this, like other 2xIPAs, a bit on the cold side, since it tames the malts and lets the hops shine through...there should be enough hops in this style to still be huge even when cold. It makes it refreshing as well. I also prefer this style in a boring old shaker pint. Heaven!"
"If you are a fan of hops, make sure to give this one a try if you can find it. I will be happy when Ballast Point crosses the border into GA."
"Crisp and light, I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting, although the abv would hit me sooner or later."
"Pours a steady one finger head, the large to medium-sized bubbles outnumber the general froth, cream white in color with average lacing. You can smell the nose before you get six inches from the glass, boisterous pink grapefruit zest and pine sap rush out to greet you, not herbaceous nor overly sharp, there's no lack of indistinct soft maltiness to be had, with it comes a hint of lactose milkiness too, coriander and Indian spices present, add punch to the pineapple, nectarine, peach, passion fruit scents, ends with a saline burst. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is huge and fluffy and has it filling the mouth steadily, if without weight per se. Pink grapefruit, tangelo, lime citrus remans the focal point. Pine sap and floral dew up next, very sticky in the mouth, clogs your pores. The creamy texture defangs a lot of the hoppy bitterness, leaves room for coffee beans, mocha powder and cocoa. As it warms more alcohol noticeable, as well as an elevation in sugars in the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, guava fruit. It's big, bold and brassy and by a whisker pulls it off. Drink as cold as possible."
"Favorite part is the smell, tastes great but the smell is tantilizing."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, I'd take this all day"
"This is definitely a tasty treat. Complex and interesting with a rich tapestry of caramel malt and fruit notes. A must try."
"On tap. Hazy deep amber with golden highlights. Looks like orange marmalade. Creamy white head. Good retention and lacing. Pine and citrus greet you in the nose. Honeyish malt. Alcohol is evident in both the aroma and the flavor. Bold and brash but not overly bitter, balanced by the big, sweet malt. A massive beer. Drinkable in that despite the strength and massive flavor you'd be inclined to want to have another."
"Outstanding offering from Ballast Point! The freshness and clean taste cannot be overstated. ABV blends in nicely."
"Overall this is a great dipa but not elite. Not top 5 but probably top 10 for me"
"The beer pours a peachy orange color with good head retention and lacing. This beer has a nice citrusy nose, with gobs of grapefruit, lime and pepper. The beer smells very much like what it is; that is a West Coast all the way IPA/DIPA. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose pretty closely, but with a wonderful, pronounced hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the beer finishes with some surprising crispness, considering the abv. Drinkability is remarkable in this 9.6% alcohol DIPA, something I attribute to this beers balance and relatively low malt bill. Everything dovetails with a long, orange, citrusy finish, and with alcohol that is barely noticeable. Simply stated, this beer is just delicious."
"Velvety smooth caramel malt, deeply bitter citrus, grapefruit pulp. Some pine and drying hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is felt, and keeps intake at a low frequency in small sips. Not boozy, but it's far from wimpy...thick and almost chewy. Not as exciting as Sculpin, but a solid DIPA that I would drink again."
"Overall this is another very good hop bomb from Ballast Point. It's close, but I think I prefer this over Sculpin. Definitely worth a shot."
"this bomber was purchaes at capones. it was poured into a pint glass and had a nice inch thick head with a very nice orange color to it.. the smell of grapefruit was amazing and the hops were great throughout. for being so hig in alcohol it was disguised very well with the hops used and went down even better. the finish was very nice and made me want another one."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0903-Geoff"
"I'm not sure how fresh this is, but I did notice that there was a raised 08 on the bottom of the bottle. From what I've noticed that pretty much holds true to the year it was bottled in. I would love to try a fresh bottle of this."
"Great example of a west coast DIPA. Just a touch too much pineapple for me, but I'd still seek it out. Thanks Rich!"
"For almost 10%, alcohol does not come through in a major way on this."
"Pennsylvania's great selection strikes again, and I'm thrilled I have access to such great beers. This one isn't quite in the upper echelon of double IPAs, but it is worth seeking out."
"A superbly balanced, delicious DIPA. Now if only I could find some Sculpin..."
"Drinkability: Hmmmm. A solid beer, and an enjoyable DIPA. As I've perhaps indicated before, I'm pretty tough on DIPAs, because they're my favorite style - I thus hold them to a higher standard. This one's definitely very good, but there were enough things slightly """off""" about it that I think I'm gonna rate it a little below average. Some slight tweaking and this could be a world class brew, however."
"a great DIPA that is not too overpowering. alcohol is not that noticeable. very easy to drink. good drinkability."
"Thanks to Reagan1984, who traded me a bottle of this to sample. Poured from the bomber to my Goose Island stemmed IPA glass, it has a solid two finger, off white head. This head slowly recedes leaving solid lacing. The color of the beer is a beautiful orange/copper blend. It definitely looks like an amazing DIPA. A sweet aroma upfront, finishes with a crisp citrus nose. The taste holds onto the sweetness in the aroma. A very sweet DIPA, there is a ton a bitterness that follows, but the upfront sweetness is rather strong. Maybe all the malt it took to get to this ABV made this intense sweetness. The sweetness is gone in the aftertaste, a far more bitter/dryness there. A dense beer, it rests heavy in your mouth, but is helped by some considerable carbonization. I have been working this bomber a little more slowly than a number of recent DIPA tastings, so I have to knock the drinkability, again that dense sweetness hurts it here. An good take on a slightly different approach to a DIPA, maybe just not what I expected from the look."
"I still need to try Sculpin..."
"D - Again, after the initial bitterness shock, this beer is very drinkable. I find myself taking bigger swigs of this one. I think I may be developing a taste for IPA's!"
"Pours a crystal clear amber/copper with a big fluffy white head that sticks around forever leaving a sticky lace all over my glass. Smells of hops mostly, odd for a double IPA :) Pine citrus grapefruit, all the usually suspects. Hints of sweet malt 3 miles underneath the onslaught of Humulus lupulus. Taste is not quite as bitter as I expected, or my palette has been ruined from the IPA's of late. Citrus and resin dominate, but the sweet taste of caramel peeks in somewhere in the middle before losing the battle to a lingering grapefruit finish. Thick body, bitter resinous mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Not a bad IPAx2"
"1st time trying this beer..it has been on my """wants""" list since joining BA. Poured a nice deep amber with big pillowy head, crystal clear in the glass. Smells very sweet, cotton candy-ish, pine, grapefruit, very nice indeed. One of the best smelling dipa's that I can remember, reminded me of dreadnaught. Taste is similar, has a nice sweetness to it. I could taste the alcohol on the 1st sip but it mellowed out as the beer warmed up. It was very smooth with good carbonation so it didnt seem like a 9.1% abv until I would get that heat from the alcohol on random tastes. I sipped on this bomber for about 90 mins during the villanova game and I enjoyed every minute of it. One per sitting is probably par for the course due the abv on this one. Glad I picked up 2 bombers when I came across this. Looking fwd to cracking the other one open in the very near future. Highly recommended. Another great offering from ballast oint."
"Not overly bitter. Very smooth. One solo 22oz? Yes. Two... well, no, too much ABV. However, I'd buy it again. Reminds me a little of Maharaja. Wow. I'm guessing this will be an A review."
"Drinkability: Nice to have this old friend back around; this bottle was just released in the past few weeks so it doesn't get much fresher - you can sure tell the difference"
"22oz. bottle served in my New Belgium Globe Glass. Served at 53 degrees. Poured a translucent copper with a half inch, loose, bright white head that quickly dissipated into a thin slick with a concentrated dollop of white in the middle and a thick frothy band around the perimeter. Thick sheets of lacing adhered to the glass during the tasting. Incredible nose - sweet grapefruit and a little bit of earthiness. Taste follows nose. Sweet grapefruit and malt up front, followed by a nice hops bite at the back with a lingering residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly viscous. Some carbonation burn across the tongue and back of the throat. Excellent DIPA - balance tips slightly towards the bitter side of the style, but exceptional nontheless."
"Pours a very clear light amber. Nice fluffy head that clings all the way down. Aroma is very nice full of pine and citrus. The smell was the best part of this beer IMHO. The taste was overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor that hangs in the back of the mouth losing a lot of the hop in the process. Was not impressed."
"An outstanding Double IPA, Ballast point continues to impress."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel. The heavy, sticky body is chaperoned along by an abundance of carbonation, thank freaking lord. But after a bomber of this, my lips are thoroughly coated with a raw hop sap that makes it hard to open my mouth. I like it and expect it, even though I've thrown up a white flag. Even with all of this going on, its somehow entirely too drinkable. A savory experience."
"D - Very drinkable and tasty beverage."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied for the style. Very easy drinking. Excellent carbonation, very crisp and refreshing."
"I've loved this beer in the bottle for a while not and to try it fresh on tap at the brewery was just sublime. The tropical fruits in this beer are just insane and luckily the rest of it's characteristics bring the same awesome level to the table as well. A classic San Diego DIPA!"
"Pours a copper color with a 1-2cm white head. The bubbles are loose, and kind of collapse, leaving a little thin pillow of bubbles with minimal lacing. Looks about right. The smell is filled with pungent hops, resinous, grassy, piney notes backed up with citrus peel and rind. Smells very much like raw hops, backed up with some powdery malty sweetness. The smell is really good, powerful and pleasant. The taste hits first with resin, piney and like the tart, sour citrus rind, but the bitterness isn't too overwhelming. The malts are a bit bready, but it finishes rather dry. The hop flavor is kind of weak, there's a hint of tropical fruit in the background, but not strong enough for me. The alcohol is a bit peachy and warming, but doesn't seem to be too annoying. I really love the resinous feel of this, I love resiny tastes in general. There's also a very nice chewiness from the malts and there's almost a feeling of swallowing hop flowers. I really enjoyed making my way through this and it didn't really phase me all too much. Very pleasant and recommended. It really hits the spot in terms of the resinous hoppy flavors. The only thing I'd recommend is putting a bit more late hops in this one, that would put it up to the very highest level."
"Pretty outstanding IIPA. A bit of the sweetness fruit that I got from a recent hopslam. Pine, big rich flavor and texture. Nice finish. Really enjoyed this brew. On tap today at the brew mart. avoids the corn flavor, complex and it warms you up a bit."
"D - One of my favorite DIPAs, and I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to try this on tap... in Philly, PA no less! This stuff is pure, liquified grapefruit hop goodness!"
"The body is moderate to full with some sweetness in the finish. Would have liked a bit lighter. The carbonation is really light and could have helped with the malt balance, although I did like the bitterness levels. To sum it up a good double ipa, but some salty and chalky notes distract. Also would have liked more complexity in the hops or at least back off on the grassy notes. Still very enjoyable to drink."
"Pours a dark amber in color with a nice frothy half inch head. Smell is somewhat past prime hops and lots of malt to help support the hops that were there. Taste is much the same. Don't know if this bottle didn't travel well or just got a old bottle. The hops are not what they should be. A little disappointing, I'll have to get another bottle and revisit."
"A nearly three fingers of foamy light tan head rises to the top of my glass showing nice retention and incredible lace as it alowly fades. Body is a bright golden orange with almost amber tones. Nose is full of sticky sweet citrus and oily hops. Those same oily hops enter the mouth and create a creamy kind of feel. Very smooth with nice citrus sweetness. An even and well balanced bitter feel is soft on the back of the tongue. Hops do become more grassy and mineral based as the beer continues to warm. Mouthfeel is almost like a peach fuzz citrus hue but much more on the bitter side. Excellent drinkability."
"This is a standout beer."
"Very nice."
"22 oz. bomber. Head is white, small, tiny bubbles. Well carbonated. Color is orange-tan, hazy. Strong aroma of fruits, candied orange, pineapple, very sweet and citrus. Starts sweet and resiny. Medium body and sticky mouthfeel. Alcohol is noticeable and present but not overwhelming. Some butterscotch. Hops are very vibrant and lingingering throughout the aftertaste."
"Apricot color, creamy white head with great retention and lacing. Apricot, mango, honeydew, cantoulope, tons of melon. Juicy grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, a touch of orange, and resin; a beautiful blend of citrus and melons. Somewhat high carbonation and medium bodied. When fresh, this is an outstanding beer."
"Draft at SD Brewing Co. One of the best Imperial IPA's out there. Dark gold with a thick head. Hops, pine, grapefruit, and resin fill the nose. The taste is exceptionally smooth and balanced. Huge hops and bitterness with a citrus and orange back. Kind of sticky feeling, but with a crisp finish."
"Overall: yummy worthy better than you"
"22oz bottle. Orange peel. Citrus. Sugary sweet. Very sweet but not cloying."
"22oz. bomber: This one poured a clear, orange tinged golden color. There was a about a finger of off-white head on it. It left some lacing down the glass. Just what I like in the aroma: a big old blast of hops. Mainly grapefruit and piney notes. Perhaps some floral, caramel and fruity notes also hiding in there. The taste is very good. Bitter, but more balanced than your typical hop bomb. Some sweetness in the aftertaste, with some fruits popping up. There may even be a tinge of pineapple in there. Very Nice!"
"22oz bottle. Hazy orange with a fine white head. Instant burst of candied pineapple, strawberry, mint in the aroma. The flavor has an intense fruity, hoppy flavor, mostly of dried mango and mint. A firm malt sweetness enhances the hops, yet isn't cloying or sticky. A bit fatter than some other west coasters, but not too flabby. Just enough bitterness to cut the body and dry the finish, in tandem with just a hint of smooth alcohol. No harshness or astringency. This bomber is going down dangerously fast, but this is still a substantial sipper. Awesome DIPA."
"Its a great DIPA, the perfect hop profile as far as Im concerned, and close to as good drinkability as you find within the style. I had this with some buffalo chicken, and it was perfect to cut the spiciness. Im really enjoying it, and would suggest it to DIPA lovers. This was my first offering by Ballast Point, and Im anxious to try their other brews."
"Cloudy grapefuit colour, white head and lace. Great hop aroma. Very good DIPA, high IBU but not a bomb of bitter. Full mouthfeel and good drinkability. Orange zest, Tangerine and sweetness in taste, good balance.This one has been a survivor, a keeper."
"Very much drinkable, but to my palate, there are other DIPA's that fit the bill (and the wallet) better."
"Overall, this was an exceptional brew. Hopefully the folks at Ballast Point will consider making this a year-round offering."
"Notes: Beer is labeled as 9.1%(not 9.6%) and offers no date information. I believe this is a fresh release however(it is a recent purchase), as I know Ballast Point has made runs of Dorado (and Sculpin) over the last month or so. Word is that there are no growler fills however, and I haven't seen bottles of Sculpin of late."
"Pours a bright hazy golden orange with a fluffy white one-finger head that lingers for a while and leaves impressive lacing. The aroma is massive and very sweet. It has an array of citrus hop aromas, grapefruits, oranges, tangerines, as well as sweet honey and caramel overtones. There is also some pine hops as well on top of a bready malt aroma in the background. The taste mirrors the aroma with a huge grapefruit sweetness up front with a strong malt backbone. The finish has a good bit of floral pine hop bitterness and lingers between sips. The mouthfeel is sticky with good carbonation and slightly dry in the finish. This is a great West Coast DIPA and I look forward to having more of these in the future. Highly recommended!"
"Dangerously drinkable. I smartly only allowed myself one of these, but what a beer. Only tried two Ballast Point beers, but we really need some of this in Oregon!"
"Poured out of the bottle into shaker pint. Pours a funky orange opaque with a really fluffy white head. Lots of hops in the aroma- some citrus, orange. Some hemp also. Tastes similar. Lots of hops and very oily hops. Decent malt backbone to follow up. Ends pretty sweetly from the malts. Mouthfeel is very chewy. I feel like I have to e this beer. It even looks chewy. Pretty decent drinkablity, but I am glad I shared this one. It destroyed my taste buds for a bit."
"Bomber - pours a hazy navel orange colour. Fluffy white head. Nose- sweet hop fruits and pale malt. Taste- citrus fruits- not quite a blast of hops as age has taken its toll. Malt flavour is cookie dry. Carbonation is good and goes down smooth. Dry finish."
"Pours a gorgeous bright glowing orange color with a lasting offwhite head. Smell is grapefruit, and orange hoppiness and sweet malt. Balanced smell. Taste is hoppy but not as much as expected. Balanced well, and smooth, sweet citrusy malt. A touch too much alcohol is coming into the flavor making it less enjoyable though. Quick finish. Somewhat easy drinking, but the alcohol presence hindered it significantly for me."
"A very hoppy yet actually quite balanced DIPA. This type of sweetness sort of gets to me after a while and becomes a little cloying by the end of the glass. I still prefer the Sculpin from Ballast Point but this is a great offering."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Very tasty beer. The high abv is noticeable, but the balance makes it very drinkable for a DIPA."
"Drinkability: This is a taxing beer. The ABV is quite apparent and it's aggressive all-round, yet it's just so delicious, it deserves a high score."
"Another great beer from Ballast Point."
"Damn fine brew!"
"D: This is dangerously drinkable. Extremely mellow, with a great balance. Nice to have a DIPA that doesn't feel the need to constantly remind you what it is. You know what I'm talking about...sometimes it's just """Geez, enough with the hops, I taste you, I taste you!""". Yeah, if you're looking for a hop bomb, this 'aint it. Big time score for Ballast Point though, this jumps way up their on my DIPA list. Too bad we probably won't be seeing it again for a while..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it might not be my first choice for a Double IPA but it's still a very good beer that I could drink for a while."
"Bomber. pours a mild orange/amber with a 2-finger head that dissipates quickly. Smell is all hops (pine, grapefruit, orange). The flavor is sweet & citrusy at the tip, with an expected, but not overwhelming, bitterness in the finish. the beauty of this stuff is the drinkability. The mouthfeel is (comparatively) bright and crisp. It lacks the surupyness that a lot of big DIPAs have. It's so easy to drink it might be dangerous. Definitely recommended."
"Slightly hazy orange colour with a full beige cap of fine bubbles. Thick solid lacing and great head retention. Rich caramel and malt aroma with plenty of hops to back it up, citrus and pine - gotta love the west coast. Additional fruity notes too, tangerine and tropical, a little mango. Great balance of flavours - solid bitterness without going over the top, malty backbone with caramel notes that isn't overly sweet, and hop flavour (mostly citrus) that doesn't overpower. There's some additional fruit character and a bit of alcohol at the finish too. Great stuff. Bitterness and malt linger. Medium, nearly full, body with average carbonation that was integrated nicely into the texture. Highly drinkable for a DIPA, with very mild alcohol warmth. Highly recommended."
"D: This is an excellent DIPA, showcasing a strong hop body that never overwhelms the mouth. I really enjoy the piney finish, it nicely sums up the ale."
"D-I absolutely love this beer...certainly one of my very favorite DIPA's....and beers of all time. This is such a great brew to satisfy that grapefruit hop love! The 9%+ would get you into trouble....QUICKLY! Too bad it is going on vacation...damn hop shortage!"
"While this is an aggressive IPA, it sets the standard for double IPAs for sure!"
"Drinkability- Okay....this one is a sipper, even for a hop-head. I'm glad I only bought one of these things, because I would be very tempted to drink 2 or 3 bombers."
"D: Once again I get the taste of a wonderful west coast IPA and have access to no more! I WANT MORE!!!"
"hazy glowing orange with a small cap of slightly off white foam that dies quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Aroma is all up front hop, a little piney, mucho citrusy, with some nice fresh baked bread malt dance in the background. Taste is great. Somewhat of a hop smack with the pine and resin, but yet also very well balanced by the malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, not too thick or too thin. Drinkability is VERY good for a DIPA. I really liked this one and actually I really like Ballast Point in general."
"Drinkability - The drinkability is awesome. It goes down easy, and tastes great. I love West Coast DIPAs - and this is a great example of that style. I have heard that they are discontinuing this beer because of the hop shortage, and that is a damn shame. This is a tasty brew. Get it while you can."
"Good beer, but not my favorite."
"Tasted of a solid citrus flavor with a strong bitter aspirin aftertaste. Not as intense of some DIPAs, but a good dose of what I'm looking for. A moderate amount of carbonation. Was still able to kill the whole bomber pretty quickly, though. Criticisms are all minor; this is a very solid offering and it's a shame there won't be any more for awhile."
"D:Man I love DIPA's baby, this one is certinaly not an exception"
"I defintely give it a thumbs up when it comes to """would I drink this again"""."
"Pours a hazy dark gold, light copper color with a small light cream head. Big hoppy aroma of juicy tangerines and grapefruit with a light malty sweetness and a hint of its alcohol strength. Taste is some tropical fruit and tangerines up front, a small bite of warming alcohol and a big grapefruit rind and pine tree puckery bitterness in the aftertaste and finish. Mouthfeel is medium and would probably be creamy save for a slightly spicy dance of hops on the tongue. A hopheads delight, great bitterness is in the drivers seat throughout, not lacking in the malts dept, just powered by hops."
"D- I've found this much better than the first time around, hence the re-review, the alcohol is well-masked at around 10% and this is one easy drinking DIPA with a very desirable mouthfeel/texture, I'm starting to come around to Ballast Point and look forward to going through more of their lineup"
"Drinks great for the ABV. A damn good, not great, but almost there DIPA"
"d. recommend drinking this one a safe distance between meals, preferably hungry, would drink again (tomorrow if on the left coast)"
"Overall: I had been wanting to try one of the Ballast Point brews for quite some time so I figured I would start with my favorite style the DIPA. After finishing this one I can state with pure confidence that you can add them to the list of GREAT west coast brewers. This one is not as aggressive as some that come from the west, but it is soo drinkable that the hophead in me will forgive them for this. I plan to seek out their entire line and you should do so as well."
"Great beer, definitely try it, worthy of it's DIPA brethren."
"A graciously hopped beer, just the way we like em here in San Diego. Im glad I finally got to try this one after sending so many of them in trades."
"D - a bit too sweet for me, but better than your average Dub."
"Pours a hazy light orange amber color with a nice white head that resists fading and some lacing in its wake. The smell is aggressive, pineapple and grapefruit hops with a solid malty sweetness. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is first 'thick' with nice pine hop notes that kick up a level with the swallowing breadth. Full flavored, the taste mirrors the balanced sweet malty fresh hopped character. A real nice drinker; the 9.6% ABV is well hidden. Recommended. Thanks to BlindPig for the opportunity."
"D - Good stuff, but would overwhelm eventually. Plus, high ABV would get to you, too."
"Pours a cystal clear golden orange with minimal head. Smells of big ol hops, piney and grapefruit. Taste starts with minimal malt then a burst of huge bittering hops and grapefruit. Medium in the mouth with great carbonation. ABV is non existant yet the hops arent overpowering and the malt is minimal and not heavy. A hophead's dream but drink this one fresh as I had an older bottle once and the age did not do it well."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the finish was pretty crisp. Drinkability is good, alcohol is pretty hidden but will catch up to you in the end."
"650 ml bottle. Pours a translucent deep orange-gold, with an off white head that had medium duration. Plenty of lacing observed. Aroma is all citrus, lemon, grapefruit, oranges and limes. Flavor is dominated by biter hops, this is a hops bomb, but its not nearly as biter as it could be. In addition to the biter the flavor has plenty of grapefruit and some biter walnuts. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying with a silky feel and plenty of carbonation. Finish is even more lingering hops, not a clean crisp finish. Overall this is a beer for people who like to push the envelope on hops, I like biter, but I prefer more complexity and a cleaner finish."
"Recommended, and was even better on tap the first time at tasted it at Hollingshead's"
"Another great Left Coast IPA. My first sampling from Ballast Point. Surprisingly more balanced than I expected, especially aftertaking a few big whiffs."
"Pours an orange copper color with a small, tightly packed white head. Lacing left on the glass. Aroma is strongly of hops. Piney and grassy and a little maltiness. Tast is big and bold. A blast of citrusey/piney hops and a lots of fruity esters. Alcohol is well masked for weighing in at over 9%. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy drinking, with a little alcohol warming in my belly. Overall another excellent beer from the superb brewers at Ballast Point."
"Rich copper color with about an inch or so of head. Very clean and clear. Good citrus & peach notes in the smell. Taste is obviously hoppy but not overly bitter. I taste oranges. Mouthfeel is """thick""" with hop oil and a dry finish. Just bordering on alcohol burn. This is a heavy beer. First bomber is drinkable and goes down well. Fills you up a bit if you are hungry. Second bomber would probably be too much. But for an imperial IPA it is very drinkable and pretty smooth. Probably a top 10 of the American IPAs. If you like hops, you'll like this one."
"I bought this in Imperial Beach on the advice of a friend and brought it back to Colorado. The color was a clear orange hue with not much white head. Smell was fruity, hoppy juicy. Taste was like watermelon rind, cantaloupe, and green melon, a bitterness in the aftertaste. This was a good beer but I actually liked the Big Eye IPA more, which is also the case with Green Flash; I like the single IPA better than the double. This was also a little more expensive than all the other DIPAs I brought back from San Diego at $7 a 22. Rock on."
"This is part of their """Robust Series""" and it lives up to its name. Excellent drinkability, though. I want to try some more Ballast Point!"
"Thanks goes to Zorro for this in a great trade!"
"D- alcohol slightly noticeable, another great west coast 2IPA, tasty, recommended, nice experience"
"D: A good Double IPA, easy to drink off the tap, I enjoyed it, would order again."
"Delicious, and quite choice. I hope they will continue to bottle this brew, as it's the best of the Ballast Point beers that I've sampled by a wide margin. I could (but, given it's high alcohol content probably shouldn't) drink this all night. I'd never believe this was close to 10% alcohol by volume."
" Overall I thought this was very good. I am a huge fan of IPA's and the west coast really knows their stuff when it comes to these big hop bombs, this was nice to though as it was really well balanced and put together."
"Pours a foggy burnt orange with a nice one finger white head that quickly dies down to a thin lacing that lasts throughout. Stickiness is pretty damn good. Wow west-coast DIPA. BIg grapefruit smell with a hint of peppery spices mixed in there: nothing more, nothing less. Simple, yet so complex at the same time, a smell like no other. With the taste there's a bit more pine on the tongue than there is in the nose which makes this such an amazing DIPA. Starts off with a fresh evergreen taste that becomes a bit bitter and dry from an earthy hop flavor. Aftertaste is almost orange/clementine-like. Such a complex tasting brew with so many flavors to offer. Sip and enjoy! Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation. Solid representation of a west-coast IPA. East-coast really has some catching up to do."
"Another great beer from Ballast Point, and one of the best Double IPAs around."
"The first thing that hit me about this one was the smell. I gotta say I didnt smell citrus or anything like that I smelled hops straight up. The color was nice had a nice orange tint in my opinion. The taste was comfortable not to bitter I would say bring on another any day. This is one I would try again and would recommend anyone else to experiment."
"This would be one of those sticky-sweet types of DIPA. Pours a tangerine orange color. Hops give off a juicy citrus taste, but no bitterness, the malt is sweet and dominates along with the hops. The mouthfeel was better than most sweet DIPA's, it had just enough of a light feel to it, even though it was a bit syrupy like most others. A tasty DIPA for sure."
"Cheers."
"An excellent beer. Nice balance. Alcohol pops through a bit much, but it is 9.6%....All my complaints are minor issues, this is a very good beer!"
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber bottle into my Russian River shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a clear golden copper color with about two fingers of off white head that leaves a nice lace on the edge of the glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells of sweet caramel malts, pine resin, citrus fruits such as lemon and orange as well as some grapefruit. Tastes of grapefruit juice, lemon, pineapple, and orange followed by herbal resinous piney hops and a great malt sweetness to balance it out. The alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Smooth and medium to full in both body and carbonation. This is a wonderful DIPA that I hope to revisit on it's next release. If you like hops, you will love this beer."
"This beer ranks #2 so far on my list of beers that have a fish on the label (Two Hearted being #1.) Every hop lover needs to try this."
"Nice big hop taste immediately upon my first sip, the bitter and fruity taste reminds me more of the grapefruity character found in the nose but as the the sweet malt starts to come into play a bit more closer to the dry finish a more pineapple like hoppy note becomes more apparent. The 9.2 abv is a fairly big but not as large a characteristic as I expected it to be. This beer has a nice smooth texture with a medium to low amount of carbonation. The complex long lasting array of fresh crisp fruity, oily, and slighty spiced hops that leads into a nice fairly pronounced (considering the big hoppiness) sweet malt does a pretty good job at subduing the 9.2abv. This is a very tasty and pretty easy to drink DIPA. It presents a nice bouquet of hop flavor and leaves you wanting more."
"I received a couple of bottles of this thanks to Intriqken and metallitone1 in the B'day 07 BIF."
"Not as hopcentric as the other big California IPA's I've tried recently but typical of the style. Very nice balance in this one which enables it to stand as one of the finer DIPA's I've tried."
"Very nice DIPA for my tastes, pretty much a hop bomb, but not ridiculously unbalanced. Definitely worth seeking out a bomber or two."
"Purchased: Park Lane Liquor, Lancaster CA"
"Pretty damn drinkable considering the high abv of almost ten percent. Juicy and resiny lends to the thickness and masks the hotness this brew could potentially deliver. A very nice tasting and quite easy drinking dpa from the west coast. Glad I had the chance to try it--Cheers Jason!"
"Overall: I liked this beer, but I dont like spending $7.00 for a 22 oz at the brewery. That seems a bit excessive."
"Drinkability- Couldn't even detect the 9% abv. Very very drinkable. Definite two thumbs up and one of the better DIPA's from CA."
"Medium golden yellow. Small head disapears quickly. Smell is intense hops grassy pine cones. Taste is right up front with the pine cones. Resiny aftertaste. Some sweetness from the alcohol comes through. I would like a little more malt. This is a hop bomb though. D is good. I could drink a few of these. Typical west coast 2xipa. Not much depth but a hop bomb which I like. there are much better 2xipas in my opinion."
"Me Likey."
"D: This is an excellent, well-balanced DIPA, showcasing a strong hop body that never overwhelms the mouth. I really enjoy the piney finish, it nicely sums up the ale."
"For me there are better DIPA's, but that is just my tastes. This one tastes unbalanced and raw...as if fresh hops are used on top of mediocre, malt extract."
"This beer is exactly what I'm looking for when I want a nice, hoppy west coast dipa. A treat. Pours a hazy dark golden with an offwhite pancake head. Good lacing. The aroma is lightly fruity with some apricot and a very lightly bitter smells. The taste has deep layered hop flavors with a solid malt background. A hop attack of pine, grapefruit, and spice. Fantastic! The mouthfeel is slightly grainy, but substantial and a great platform for all the hops. The alcohol is well hidden. Great drinkability, would be perfect if it were slightly lighter in body."
"A great beer, but I think a fresher example would boost the numbers."
"I still prefer the beer on tap, but hey.. it works any which way."
"My burps actually taste like hops and smell like grapefruit. Mouthfeel is great. Full and bubbly. It's a little expensive, but one of the best beers I've tried in a while...which says a lot. Definitely as good if not better than the infamous Drednaught- my standard for DIPA's- which is good because this one's a little easier to find in Cali. I'm sure all the hops in this are expensive, but find a way to lower the price to 3.99 or less per bomber (Lagunitas style) and make it a year-round release, and you've got my new favorite beer."
"This is get you in """big trouble easy""" drinkable. TASTY is the only word that applies here and this is just about liquid hop sex in a bottle. This is in the same class as the top three Super IPAs in the world and might just be the best."
"With a 9.1% ABV this beer is still very smooth and satisfying."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent DIPA. Huge and yet completely quaffable. I think this is, perhaps, the best alcohol-masking done in any DIPA I've ever tasted, if that's any testament to this beer's excellent craftsmanship. Well done, and way better than the bleh Yellowtail Pale Ale I didn't even bother to review. ; )"
"Clear copper, toped with a wispy white head. Smells of big, juicy, citrusy hops and toasty malt. Some apple and pear, but most of the fruitiness comes from the hops. No alcohol. Big flavor, with good balance. The hops come through early, with robust bitterness, with enough toasty malt sweetness. Some barleywine aspects, particularly with the malt bill. Hops maintain dominance, but I'd say its particularly well balanced for a big beer. Pretty clean, allowing the hops and grain the full spectrum without much interference. Lots of orangey citrus. Slight pruney fruitiness. Moderate carbonation. Big body, with a fairly mellow mouthfeel. Not insanely complex, but still awesome. Big, bold and excellent, I'd love to have this again."
"Medium body with a dry, bitter finish. Nice hoppy aftertaste has me longing for the next sip. This is good. Another solid brew from Ballast Point...how I wish we could get them over on this coast. Santa did get my letter after all. Thanks Jason...oops, I mean Santa."
"Ok, this is different, not bad just very different from other Double IPA's I've had. I wasn't expecting that wash of citrus fruit flavor. The hops although very present on the nose, take a back seat to this woody fruitiness. Maybe this is done to create some balance, which it indeed does, however when I reach for a double IPA i'm looking for something heavier in the hop department. That said, this is tasty."
"Pours a cloudy deep orange color, nice carbonation, nice small foamy off-white head, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, citrus, spices, and caramel. The taste is nicely bitter/hoppy, sweet kinda honey like, with a slightly dry finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, my first Ballast Point, but not my last, I have a few of their other offerings. Highly recommended."
"A very potent, take no prisoners West Coast DIPA. Pefect for the hopivore that I am. Nice...."
"Many thanks to the Bum of Long Beach for yet another great West Coast Hop Bomb."
"Beer is good. Happy bright 2IPA beering."
"For a double IPA, this was probably the least amazing I've tried so far. The brew lacked any head and an interesting color, but was an ok light amber with some slight lacing. The smell was malt intensive and the hops weren't impressive. The taste was alright, but the flavor was subdued by the bitter quality of the hops. Piney hoppiness and not so rich malt flavor were abundant in an unfortunate way. The mouthfeel was overly bitter, but I found the body to be heft enough to carry the amount of alcohol. I was able to complete a pint, but it is not so drinkable, and will not be trying this brew again."
"This beer was a good attempt at a DIPA, but fell victim to being too sweet and syrupy, much like the Stone 10th did."
"Just as a note... I still think it is an alright DIPA, but it would be much better with a little bit of cohesion. Thanks to dogfooddog for the bottle."
"Dense oily body with some light carbonation. I love these hoppy, oily IIPA's. Very smooth and drinkable for the style. The bitterness actually isn't too bad because the malt keeps everything fairly balanced. I dig it."
"two bottles, what was i thinking? case, here i come!"
"I Like it!"
"Notes: Well well well...this brewery is climbing the charts and I can't argue with the reasons why....good beer. Rind and Bark with a zippy carbonation and smacking alcohol. WOW! Very good to excellent. $7 buck tag on a bomber....plenty of similar options for $4...only time will tell."
"D: Alcohol is well hidden in this brew. Dynamic enough to seperate itself from the rest of the IPA/DIPA crowd which seems to be increasingly difficult to do."
"drinkability: good"
"Yet again, Ballast Point Brewing Company comes through with a solid, delicious version of a classically American style. These guys are often overshadowed by the AleSmiths and the Stones of the beer world, but cracking open a bottle of their beer is all it takes to prove that, in many cases, they deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with the San Diego County giants. Dorado Double IPA is all the proof that anyone should require."
"Overall: I first sampled this mighty beverage at the 7th Annual San Diego Strong Ale Festival, back then in 2003 it was listed as 8.6% ABV on the Beer List that was handed out at Pizza Port. The bottled version seems to be a little higher in strength and even in the taste department. $5.99 at Holiday Wine in Escondido but at least a $1 more than that in other establishments. I am so glad this is now bottled, sadly the only thing keeping me away from this one on a regular basis.is maybe the price, but like crack, its that addictive that I could maybe treat myself on occasion after a few local burglaries. A Limited Release from Ballast Point, so I suspect this one will not be around on the Shelves for too long, so if you see it, grab some whilst you can, despite the price."
"Still, Ballast Point continues to impress with their beers and their new brewing and bottling capacity is obviously being put to good use in bringing more of their products to the package market."
"Enjoyed a tasty pint of this """S.D.""" style (What a great beer town!) DIPA @ O'Brians. It poured light clear amber, with a prety typical looking tan head. The lacing was fine and plentiful. The sniff was of light, guess what, hey we're in SD... .grapefruit. This is yet another SD hopalicious hop bomb of a DIPA. Waves of Grapefruit, continue to pass along the tongue, nostrils and all other senses. Recommended for all hop lovers."
"I had this after the Stone 10th ADIPA and this was not as good but still a solid product. Grapefruit lovers will love this beer as it is the dominant flavor in the early, mid and later stages. Bone dry, bitter and citrusy which is what you expect. This is worth a try for all hop lovers."
"The hops hide the alcohol and dominate this brew for the most part. Don't want too miss this one if you love hops and a strong brew...a solid 2XIPA if there ever was one..."
"A great one from BP, and I'm stoked to finally see this one in bottled form. Don't know what the availability is going to be outside of the Linda Vista and Scripps Ranch outlets, but it is totally worth seeking out."
"Overall: double IPAs seem to walk the road of juicy (Pliny, Racer X) or the road of caramel (Hop 15). This one is caramelly, a bit much for my taste."
"Light gold color. Large white foamy head. Aroma is hoppy and fruity. A medium bodied double bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are spicy, piney and juicy. The hops really dominate in this beer, yet there is still a residual sweetness that balances all those hops. Nicely balanced. Very smooth. No alcohol bite, despite an 8.6% alcohol content. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"The beer pours a translucent amber color with a moderate sized white and semi-creamy head with a fine coating of lace. The nose is hop floral, sweet malt backing, clean and fresh, citrus crisp with just a hint of earthiness from the malt, slightly sweet and nicely malted start, top is light to middling in feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonation, the hops powerful in their double spicy bite, and the aftertaste dry as a desert bone, a quite nice double IPA."
"Dorado Double IPA is a very well-crafted beer that is almost too easy to drink, given its %ABV. While Im not a big IPA fan, I can honestly say this brew is one Id order up again in a heartbeat when looking for a hops infusion."
"The nose is very good with plenty of citrus and aromatic hops in evidence. The flavor is very much of citrus with a strong grapefruit taste predominating. Plenty of complexity here, but the malt is rather subdued because of the hop content. The feel is full but less creamy than expected. A very snappy finish makes it a winner."
