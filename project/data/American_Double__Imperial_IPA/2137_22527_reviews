"O - On the malty side, but a very nice brew nonetheless.  Delightfully thick and smooth."
""
"Interesting DIPA, not overly hopped hint of floral and citrus. For a 9.2% not to heavy on alcohol taste. Overall a good but not great DIPA, would definitely only have 1 at a sitting."

"O- Ipa flavors and aromas came up short here."

"Lots of good beer coming out of Colorado.  Excellent DIPA.  Hoppy and best served on draft."

"I went to the Micro Festivus in Roanoke Virginia and hands down this was the best IPA. Perfect balance of malt and hops. Smooth on the tongue and and amazing after taste. If you have not had this you are missing out!"

"Final Word: A take it or leave it IPA, unless you are a true hop lover. While the higher ABV came through a bit too much in the flavor profile, that was really my only complaint with this beer, and my neutral opinion of it is due to the fact that it didn’t present anything unique or out of the ordinary for the style. The hop flavor was exceptionally pure and fresh on the tongue, but didn’t have quite enough malt character throughout to keep the piney bitterness in check. Hop lovers will adore this beer, due to the aforementioned freshness and purity, which really is the strength of this brew, but other drinkers will likely find it a bit unbalanced and strong, seeking more well rounded IPAs instead. I’ll never tell you not to order this one, but I’ll most likely always recommend another."

"Breckenridge Small Batch 471 Double Hopped IPA ---3.5/5"
"Came bottled. Inch think head after pur that quickly dissipated most likely due to unclean glassware. Medium to dark orange in color. Citrus/lemon zest on the nose with notes of honey. Sweet on the front that tastes the whole way through but with beautiful bittering hops on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium but goes down syrupy. All around good beer and packs a punch. Hides the alcohol well with its abundance of flavors."

"O - A really great beer. Not your typical hop forward citrus IPA but one that focuses more on malts and sugar. Definitely a 4 pack to come back to. The ABV is nice too!"
""
""
""
""
"This beer smells wonderful. Nice amber color, with a decent tan head. Hoppy taste, with high alcohol content. An unbelievable smooth finish, with a slight accent of caramel that really surprised me. I will definitely be purchasing some of this, as the one I received from a friend is definitely not enough! Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A lovely copper. crystal clear pour with a rich tan head. Very smooth mouth feel without a heavy alcohol presence in spite of the 9.2% ABV. A rich, hoppy taste and finish that was a very pleasant surprise. This is an IPA that I would never hesitate to enjoy."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/1/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy orange amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, peach, citrus rind, floral, grass, caramel, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, orange peel, floral, grass, citrus rind, caramel, bread, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, peach, pineapple, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a crisp and moderately slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. All around great complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Crisp, smooth, and well carbonated, the medium body strays toward heavier territory but keeps it bright and clean."

"O: this is a solid beer...interesting because of the booziness while still maintains hoppy character"
""
""
""

"So, I walked away from this one with mixed emotions."

"Night before I sampled this for the first time, I had tried Sixpoint Resin and Hi-Res DIPAs. While I'm starting to lose my appreciation for the DIPA, this one does it very well. Similar piney citrusy stuff like in Resin/Hi-Res, but calmed down a bit and more balanced. I'd try it again, since I like heavy alcohol content, but lately, I'm toning down my hop intake and sticking with IPAs and PAs."
""
""
""
"Overall, a really solid beer. I would pick it up again. I would be interested in other small batch beers that Breckenridge comes out with after trying this."
""
""
"This ale pours a very cloudy Orange brown color with a lot of sediment in the pour. It gives a small white head that gives way to a thin white film and very little lacing. The nose is extremely malty and rich but at the same time one note. The flavor on the other hand is much deeper and more complex than I expected. There is an abundance of malt up front (and some of it seems roasted giving a slight coffee bite to the beer). But behind that there is the bitter bite of a great double ipa. This is no west coast ipa but it still gives that pleasant bitter tingle on the tongue. There is also a slight alcohol bite that is pleasant and a great reminder of what this beer is. Id love to try another bottle of this, a little fresher next time to see if the hops take the foreground or if it meant to be malt forward. All in all a great pour from an unfamiliar brewery."

"Pours an off-white, three-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light grapefruit hop nose, flavor is a good balance of grapefruit and sweet malt. Higher ABV is hidden. Nice ImpIPA. $3.10 for a 12oz bottle from Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
"There's some life in this beer. Hoppy indeed, albeit faded. Bits of pineapple, pine, bitter grapefruit rind, and a load of resin make the flavor. There's a sugar coating which adds a much needed sweetness to the beer. The alcohol hides itself well. It's full bodied with a creaminess and a tolerable dose of bitterness. Added together, this Double IPA sits near the middle of the pack."
""
""
""
""
"Every now and then along comes a beer with a lot of praise that I may miss out on luckily enough my bottle shop saves me one to try anyway time for reality and it pours a dirty apricot hue with a nice ever present two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is very hoppy with notes of peach,apricots and tropical fruits,the mouthfeel is full bodied with minimal carbonation just as if from a hand pump and the tastes are pretty much one paced when they encounter the malts it's a combination of sweet candy malts and piney tropical hops and the finish has a slight piney bitter finish but i feel the malts really tame this one down and overall glad I've tried it but not as good as I've been told cheers."

"O. Nothing special, nothing bad. Just down the middle."
""
""

"Final Thoughts: Moderately impressed with this one. I was expecting an orange malt bomb, which is almost spot on, but the juicy element keeps things from getting stale. Would I drink it again? Sure."

"The beer poured a golden amber with a substantial white creamy head. The aroma held tropical fruits and those dank hops I love. The initial taste hit with a solid hop bitterness with piney and dank hops and some tropical fruit for good measure. It had a very nice hop profile that was bitter and flavorful with the dank hoppiness that always pulls me in. The Small Batch IPA had a slightly sweet finish but left a nice lingering bitterness. The 471 was a really well crafted beer and a taste profile I liked a lot."

"O - this is an 'ok' american DIPA, but I would say worth a try. Very easy to drink, but nothing really breaks the mold on this one. Their are so many other options in this category that I will probably never come back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent version. Solid in flavor and structure."
"(3.75) D: This is a good double IPA that is rich, earthy, and floral. The ABV is also well hidden."
""
""
""

"Another american double that is unbalanced. Pass this one up."

"Poured into a pint glass from a pint bottle. Pours an amber/gold with decent carbonation and head. Nice lacing. Smells of citrus and pine. Not thick and goes down pretty clean. Average light penetration. Tastes like an IPA should, hoppy with notes of pine, citrus and maybe something more grassy. Hoppy, but not so much for a """double hopped""" IPA. Overall, a good IPA. Would definitely drink again, but I can't say this one in any way tops or distinguishes itself from the bulk of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe just a bad bottle judging by everyone elses review, but really not pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very cloudy amber color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is decent.  There is a lot of precipitate in the beer.  Strong piney, citrus aroma with hints of caramel.  Great malt to hop transition.  Bready, piney, some caramel at the end.  Smooth aftertaste.  Slightly astringent at the end.  Hides the alcohol content very well.  Good beer.  Couldn't drink multiples but great for sipping and slowly enjoying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the glass after the pour. Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid hop aromas and flavors."

"Poured into snifter; cloudy dark orange/amber with a thin filmy head that fades into nothing but a rim. Smell is big juicy citrus fruits, I'm getting grapefruit and mandarin oranges. There is also some alcohol in the nose. Taste is just like the smell, but in reverse order; alcohol bathes the tongue in heat before thick, sweet malt takes over followed by the sweet fruit. Finish is very bitter hops destroying everything until just a lingering bitterness and malt stickiness remain."

"O: Not a great DIPA, and I don't think this one has the excuse of being an old bottle, either. Certainly nothing to drainpour, but there are too many great DIPAs out there to seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it passes the test of a decent Double IPA. Lacking on the aroma is makes it up with a good hoppiness. Give it a shot if your into the style."
"Pours a hazy amber with a moderate white head that dissipates quickly. Lots of floral and piney hops in aroma. Flavor is similarly strong, with the addition of some sweet citrus, caramel malt and soy sauce. A nice, aggressive IPA. Hoppiness isn’t as strong as in some IIPAs, but a solid entry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Simple ipa. Too many I come across seem to be more than they need to. This is an example of enjoyable basic ipa. I would suggest for a first time ipa sampler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer's taste does not live up to its appearance and smell; which is a shame because it looks and smells nice. If you are looking for a strait up hop bomb then give this a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think I'm done with Breckenridge for a while."
"Somewhat one-note. Far from elegant. Still a hop dream, if you need to brush your teeth with the stuff. Don't knock it 'til you try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"471 IPA pours a clear golden color with a nice large creamy head. There is a strong floral, hoppy aroma, almost burns the nostrils. The taste is bold and hoppy taste. Good full flavor, but not a very dry aftertaste, but still finishes with a nice bitterness. Overall a nice bold IPA, enjoyable."

"my buddy brought this up this weekend as its his favorite iipa, personally I think the other brews we drank over the weekend only highlighted the issues of this beer. we had much better ipas in his time up here (PtE, sucks, lagunitas ipa, devils backbone ipa). for me not enough of the hops comes through and it is entirely too malty. as others have indicated balance and flavors are off and i wouldn't buy it myself. I will likely only drink this again when I visit him. it is very smooth for such a high ABV beer, I just don't think it is a great iipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very hoppy and enjoyable beer, I know the hop craze is getting out of popularity with some folks but I still love the big hoppy beers. Very well balanced with a very enjoyable taste."
""
""
"O: Pretty good stuff. At $3 a snifter during happy hour, I'll be back to get this again."

"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bright copper hue with a thin but sticky white head. Subdued aroma but it opens up more on the palate. Usual American hop suspects - Simcoe, Chinook, and Centennial listed. Pine with some orange zest and fresh thyme. Hops aren't aggressive but are vibrant and juicy. Malt lends a biscuit and light caramel flavor. A lingering sweetness softens however many IBUs are present. A solid DIPA with a nice hop oil texture. Not close to the best in the style but certainly enjoyable."

"This is a nice balanced beer and the 9.2% abv is buried in here. The hop bite is nice and offset by the sweet malt towards the back of the tongue. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My wife picked this one up as a surprise, and what a treat this is. Looks and pours like a Two Hearted, if you know what I mean; all coppery, and dark and cloudy and yummy. Smells of sweet, somewhat roasted malt with floral and fruit hops, and not much pine on the nose. Taste is very good and balance, rising sweet malt at first, and then hops and bitterness that runs and runs...great sustain here. Mouthfeel is right there, and alcohol is contained with the profile, and carbonation is fuzzy and fussy and lovely and everything. I really like this brew."
""

"O: This beer looks incredible with huge particles and great lacing. It's really smooth too. I liked the look and feel of this beer better than the Firestone Walker Double Jack, but this beer didn't smell or taste quite as good at that one. Overall, I'd say it's a tie between the two."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew. I nicely crafted IPA with some good complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Since I'm no hop-head, I drank this primarily because it was a small batch DIPA. I had expected to be bombarded with hops and spices, but to my surprise the beer was smooth, almost light for its ABV, and not nearly as dry and hoppy as I feared. A pleasant surprise that I'd consider drinking again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked it."
""
""
"The appearance is great - color, clarity, a bit of head. Just right. The smell is a fresh one. The taste is big an bitter, but not at all dark. More floral, but really nothing but bitter. Nice. I may seek this out on my trip to Colorado in December."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good beer but not in my top 5 when it comes to the best Double/Imperial IPAs. I really like it and definitely has a lot to show for it. The overall beer is complex but doesn't need a little tweaking., doesn't mean it's bad just you know there's room for improvement. Salud!"
""
"Overall: I like DIPAs and I like barleywines so this one isnt bad its just kind of stuck between the two style. The flavors suggest a high ABV without being too boozy though. I want more from the hops to like this one more."
"D - Not bad, the aroma is better than the flavor, with a nice pine and grapefruit scent that is never quite matched by the flabby taste."
""
""
""
"M: It's actually kind of refreshing, which is weird because it's an almost 10% ABV beer! Mine has a wet, refreshing finish without lingering hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"O = Me likey. Hate paying $10 for a 4-pack, but you (usually) get what you pay for. Will come back to this one again!"
"O: This is a pretty solid beer. There is nothing too spectacular about this beer, but its one that is always easy to drink."
""
"Overall: Very drinkable for a 9.2% abv. Would love to have this one on tap to see if I can spot any more subtleties. Pretty complex and good example of the style."
"Overall: this is a pretty good double IPA. I'd like a more balanced aroma and a bit more carbonation for improved head and even more creaminess, but overall I like it."
""
"Worth a try if you're a fan of the style. It's certainly one of the better examples I've had in a while."
""
""
"Overall Impression- 4's all across the board on this one. I recommend this one as a great Double IPA for its complexity, strength, and fruit included. Haven't seen this one in the MO market because of the """Small Batch""" program? Enjoy if you can!"
"-Overall 4.0: Very good to excellent IPA. Flavors are balanced and hopiness is nuanced and never overpowering. If you hate IPAs, you should try this one. It may make you change your mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Way too quaffable for a 9.2% ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this both on tap and from the bottle. The bottle was better, and this is the rate for the bottle. Pours a deep amber color with a small creamy ring of head. Nice lacing. Aroma of strong caramel malts and some heavy grapefruit and tropical notes in the background. Flavor follows, big sweetness, with some bitter grapefruit to balance that out and keep it from being a sweet light barleywine. Super slick mouthfeel, medium carbonation. I would have this again."
""
""
""
"Serving: Bottle to Sam Adams PP."
""
""
""
""
"As I let the beer warm the malt characteristics become more apparent and the hops are more vibrant. I think I would let this beer sit for a bit at room temp so that the flavors can mature. Overall an awesome double and surprisingly drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: A very smooth DIPA despite the substantial bitterness and ABV this is easy to drink. I like this and will be buy more from time to time but I generally want more hops flavor in an IPA or Double IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good DIPA but can easily get lost among other, finer crafted DIPAs. Definitely stands above average. Easy drinking at 9.2% and is nothing too offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll have another, please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a unique design to the style, so if it's available go ahead and give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That also included the alcohol - which couldn't be tasted but was easily felt by the time I finished off the beer. Someone who's crazy about this style might not find that this measures up to similar examples from California but this is still worth giving a try and enjoying. Anyone who's never had a DIPA before would be well-versed to start here."
""
""
"Overall - This beer is just a few small changes away from being fantastic. There is something a little too artificial in the taste, but it's still a very good DIPA. Well worth trying once at least."

"O - Really solid DIPA, pretty sweet, I could drink this most anytime."
""
"This is a decent DIPA. It's malt character is very forward and it has a nicely balanced hop character. The caramel sweetness to me is a bit sticky and at times too sweet though the barley malts lends great breadiness. The alcohol is prevalent and potent in both flavor and mouthfeel. Overall, a good DIPA but a bit sticky and boozy. It's worth a try."

"Hazy orange-golden with a thumbs with white head that recedes to a slight layer over the surface. Nice lacing. A great sweet, citric aroma of some grapefruit, lemon, and orange on top of a bready underbelly. Flavor matches the aroma quite well. Some definite sweetness to this, some great citric fruitiness, a nice malt underbelly, and then in the end some bitterness shows itself. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice active mouthfeel to this, around medium modied and crisp. Overall, probably the best Breckenridge beer I have tried. I was really surprised by this one in the best of ways."

"O - Not bad, but not the best either. A decent double and worth the purchase."
"The flavors and mouthfeel are a total mess, but the looks and scent are right on point. One of the better BB brews. Recommended if it's up against a BMC, otherwise there's better balanced IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Beyond its flaws, the beer is an interesting balance in extremes. Sweet caramel malt shows early and is then overpowered by a significant hop punch that fires on all cylinders...resin, bitterness, citrus, pine."
""

"I had this once previously and thought better of it at that time. However, today, it is just another beer and perhaps past its prime."

"O: real good stuff; I have a weak sense of smell, so my biggest determinants of review are taste and feel, and this beer impressed on both accounts; looked like some of the pumpkin ales I had this past fall. Having been loving Shipyard's XXXX Imperial IPA and Dogfish Head's Burton Baton, I was looking for a kindred spirit, and I found it in this beer: not oaky/whiskey like Burton B, and more subdued citrus than the XXXX. Impressed! Cheers!"

"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-murky brownish orange with a thin head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of citrus and tropical fruits. Sweet and hoppy. Flavors of citrus, namely orange, and some bitter pine. A bit bready. Taste is sweet with a nice wallop of bitterness. Grapefruit flavor throughout. Resinous and piney towards the end. Dry mouthfeel. Not very boozey tasting for a 9.2 Abv. Overall this is a really good Imperial Ipa that is easy to drink. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"A well done IPA with a kick...you dont really taste the 9.2ABV but can definintely feel it....!"
"Overall: another good dipa. Not great but tasty."
"In the flavor, a fairly easy drinking and mellow profile. Upfront, mild grapefruit, sticky hop resins, and solid bitterness. The malt body has a sugary/honeyed character, and some clean alcoholic esters are there as well. Pretty well balanced, though in the finish 471 leans on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat smooth. Overall, a pretty solid effort from Breckenridge."
"Would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose carries light tropical Frits plus some nice citrus runs and a touch of pine. The flavor brings fairly-heavy bitterness along with some nice American hops. A bit of malt in the background, though not toouch. Light-medium body with heavy bitterness and a solid dry finish. Really quite well done."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a 1 finger head decent sticky slimy film around the glass. Malt, with faint citrus, lemon some peach, brown sugar, molasses. The taste opens up a little more with a grapefruit/ pineapple crisp bitter feel, alot more citrus fruit notes come out. Big lemon bitter on the finish with a smooth sugary malt backbone. Big on feel and body, this is a big sugary sweet beer, bitter and bold. Overall this is a malt bomb of a DIPA, and the fact that i have no idea if this is fresh or not is pissing me off. Probably will not revisit until they put a bottling or best by date."
""
""
""
"This is a wonderful DIPA with great malt presence that brings out the bitter hop flavor. The 9.2% ABV is hidden deceptively well. So be careful- this one sneaks up on you."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a light copper with a thin layer of head that dissipated quickly. The nose is of fresh pine needles. The malt and hop flavors are in good balance here but this offering really lacks the bitter hop punch that I expect to find in a solid DIPA."
""
"I've tried this beer up a few times and finally decided it was a good one to post a review on. I love hops just as much as the next HopHead and this one definitely had a great fresh floral and fruity taste to it. At $12 for a four pack it was a little on the pricier side but it's also not a four pack I'd put down in one sitting. Looking forward to trying some more beers from Breckenridge as the 471 didn't let me down!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice coppery, amber color, with a finger of snow white head. Minimal lacing. The nose is big citrus fruit. Very nice. Taste supports it with flavors of orange, tangerine adn melon. A nice pale malt backbone asserts itself mid-palate, but it's quickly overcome by hoppy bitterness. The finish is dry and bitter. Medium body and a medium level of carbonation make this quite drinkable. I picked this up on a whim, and I'm not regretting it. A tasty IPA, and a credit to Breckenridge's brewers."
"Overall, I like this beer because it doesn't crush my soul with bitter hops. Oh, they're there, but I can taste the malts also, making for well-rounded beer. Also, for 9.2% ABV, it goes down very well."
""
""
""
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much of anything out of this beer, but its easily one of my favorites now."

"3.5 D: Solid beer. The nose made this worth the purchase alone."
"Received as part of a Beer of the Month Club six pack at Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall pint glass. Pours a nice darker straw/amber color with a one finger head that leaves nice lacing. Smells of a floral and citrus notes. It has a great hoppy bite, along with a little citrus taste. A nice balance of hops and malt for a DIPA. Is a medium bodied beer and has a nice balance of carbonation for the beer. It is one I could drink for awhile. Overall, a very good beer and one I wish would be around for more than just small batch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was impressed with this one pulling it's own next to other top varieties of the style. Only think holding me back is the $3.50 a single price tag and it being only found at one shop. Would pick it up at halftime though."

"{update - drinking an undated but clearly older bottle in Jan. 2013, the aged version is considerably tamer - more soft IPA than aggressive DIPA}"

"dark amberish with orange highlights. off-white head that holds forever and leaves tons of lace. nose to me is grapefruit and grain overlying a golden caramel character. taste is a harmonious blend of citrus, grass, tropical fruits, pine, a touch of caramel and some semi-sweet bread. very nice. well done. medium-full body that has cleansing carbonation mid palate, yet remains creamy. piney, grapefruit ring bitterness in the finish, and an alcohol component that seems to fit in and amplify rather than offend. a classic dipa that definitely should not be looked over. finesse and balance on this one. very very very good."

"Overall: Delicious beer. The balance is nearly perfect, but the slick feel is usual."
"And for the reveal...Breckenridge 471 IPA. I haven't had too much from Breckenridge but they have never impressed me before. I was a big fan of this however, and at 9.2% ABV this is one hell of an IPA. Thanks Kevin! (shrek806)"
""
""
""
"I enjoy this beer cold, in a frosty glass. It has a smooth feel in the mouth, easy to drink and at the end, it reminds you that it is still a kicking IPA. I like IPA's that punch you in the face with hops, and this one does this in a way that I say BRAVO! Very tasty beer."
""
""
"I tried this beer while visiting my favorite watering hole. The beer is redish in appearance forming a half inch head when poured in a pint glass; the nose is complex, traces of hops, cinnanmon and caramel hits your nose; the taste is also multifaceted, leading is the taste of hops followed by notes of caramel and a bitter aftertaste which does not offend the palate. I will pair this beer with a sharp cheese or Italian Capicolla...and remember to support your local brewery. Drink Beer!"
""
""
""
"I will have to get ahold of some more of this one. And soon."
"O - a solid double ipa, but nothing i would buy again"

"The bomber was reasonably priced and easy to get, but I'd probably seek out other DIPAs instead."

"Notes: There is quite the malty backbone in this one but it still has a great hop bite. Cheers."
"Quality small batch DIPA. Give it a shot"
"The beer is orange to amber colored with a thick head. Great retention and ample lacing complete an outstanding appearance. The aroma offers a balance of hops and caramel malts. The flavor offers a subtle touch of earthy flavor to go along with a somewhat hop forward beer. Malt is in there as well, but plays a secondary role. A bit sweet, with alcohol hidden fairly well considering the 9.2% abv. Overall, a decent brew. Worth a try."
"O- Again, I hope this was just an old bottle because this was horrendous. Almost no hop anything in this beer: No taste. No aroma. Nothing."

"O: One of my favorite Double IPA's and a constant in my fridge when available in FL."

"D: Tastes alright, but needs to be less sweet. It's drinkable, but not something I'll buy again if I can find other stuff that's more bitter."
""
""
"O: good lord is this beer solid. I could see myself drinking this beer as a solid example of a double, not to pricey, not too over welling, its pretty darn good."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is oily slick and smooth with mild carbonation, a medium body, a chewy feel, and a tart bitter finish that was full of citrus flavor, caramel and sweet malt to make for a pretty drinkable DIPA. Not the greatest DIPA, but still really good and worth a try."
""
""
""
"O: Not what I expected, since it could easily be mistaken for a regular IPA, which is not a bad thing. It hides the alcohol well and drinks easily with a lot of good flavors. Definitely my favorite beer from Breckenridge to date."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a really tasty DIPA that doesn't disappoint. It's got a nice drinkability quality, though I would certainly take it easy if having more than one or two. There's a great hop character that satisfies my craving with no real sign of alcohol. I will certainly come back for more in the future."

"Wow....this is a good beer! I can't believe I picked it up out of the Binny's singles bin!!!! The beer pours a hazy amber. The head is very thin, slightly off-white, but is lacing. The smell includes deep citrus and pine notes...subtle but good! The taste is an extremely well balanced beer...the malt, hop, and ABV dance together in great harmony!!! The hops provide a citrus pine flare to sweet malt that provide a fight against the higher ABV! The mouthfeel is solid...full bodied ale with good to mild carbontation. Overall the beer is wonderfull. Not a session beer...for it would annihalate....but absolutely worth a taste!!!!"

"Overall: A decent brew that I wouldn't purchase but I wouldn't turn down a free pour of it either."
"Carbonation is on the high side and the finish is rather short without a lot of lingering bitterness. A DIPA that’s very middle of the road. Drinkable. Hides the alcohol very well. Worth a shot."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Love the coppery look and had a nice pillowy white head. Great nose, alot of grapefruit. Surprisingly malty considering the aroma.High in alcohol but doesn't really drink like it is.Really good representation of the style, first beer from Breckenridge won't be the last."
"O- After having two unexciting beers by this brewery (Agave Wheat and Lucky U IPA), this is a pleasant surprise. A great, firm IPA with a lot of character."
"Light brew that goes down smooth with light carbonation. I actually enjoyed this one which is rare for me when drinking a 2xIPA. I would try it again."
"a really solid double ipa. poured into a chilled pint at the breck taproom downtown denver. yellowish golden amber color with a bright white head. smell big bold hops and taste is true. resin heavy hops in the palate and a bittersweet finish that is memorable. mouthfeel is perfect for this beer, the lighter side of medium with a certain """i want another""" vibe. at over 9 percent though, you'd better have a sober driver. if not for the oatmeal stout, this would be breckenridge's best offering."
"I'm a big fan of DIPAs, and when I initially poured this, I had big expectations. It had a nice head and lacing with a light caramel/copper color. However, the nose was initially masked by the alcohol. The malts, citrus, and pine notes did eventually come through with repeated sniffing though. It had a pretty nice mouthfeel, but the taste was only average to me. I think the kicker was a lingering bitterness that I haven't really encountered with other DIPAs. I would really like to give this another go on tap."
"Pours clear, foamy, with a big citrusy bouquet. I get some pine notes, some resin on the finish. Lots of effervescence from the draught, wondering if it’s overcarbonated? Surprisingly light for a DIPA, but definitely a strong one at 9.2%."
"A very nice beer. Seems hard to get. Will probably never get to try again but am glad I got to try once. Definitely recommend."
"This pours a hazy light orange color with a large white head which has decent retention and leaves a pacing. The smells are of citrus and pine hops with a little alcohol smells. The feel is medium. The taste is mostly of hops with caramel malts. Overall not a bad iipa."
"O- Overall, this is a pretty tasty IPA that is worth a try. Recommended!"
"O: Not something I would go crazy over but very enjoyable. Above average for the style, the hop profile is good with a nice mix of hops but there is not a definitive taste that sets it apart from the pack."
"Very solid DIPA. Crazy price at my local bottle shop will probably prevent me from having much again but a brew that will make me seek out others from them."
"This is a must-try for every hop head. Highly recommended."
"O- This beer packs a punch with a great array of smells and tastes. Still remains very drinkable and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes IPA's. Well crafted beer"
"Overall - If you like big citrus hops with just a touch of sweetness to offset with a bitter citrus finish, then this is your DIPA. A very good DIPA, and one that I would try again. I personally prefer a little more hop complexity and a bit more malt/carmel in the middle."
"O: A nice, well-rounded DIPA with equal parts hops and sweet malts. Hops within reason, not something that will make a hophead crave another. Enjoyable and relaxed for a DIPA."
"overall, i really enjoy this beer. a great dipa. that being said, there are equal or better options for way less money (this six-pack was 16.99). a well done beer, but wont look to drop that sort of cash on it again if given better and cheaper options."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink because the bitterness isn’t overpowering and the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"This beer is a winner! Enthusiastically recommended. But hey, I'm just some guy in Ohio."
"O-this IPA seems to be more focused on bitterness than flavor, which is okay with me, but i do like to see a good balance of both. its definitely a tasty beer, one that I think hop heads will appreciate."
"O: The combination of the visual and the taste of this beer really makes me feel like this is a fresh JW Lees Harvest Ale. The flavors seemed so familiar, and it once I made that connection I really have been unable to separate these beers. Obviously there's a difference in gravity, and in the intention of consumption, but this has a strikingly similar (but much much lighter) flavor profile. With all that in mind, I have to admit I liked this beer. The lightly chewy leathers with the slow release of juicy flavors from dried fruits made this an unexpected pleasure. The dried fruit flavors are intensely bright, but still have that unmistakably muskiness that reeks of dried fruits. Unexpected ones too: Pineapples, persimmons, tangelos. This was unusual to drink, and hid the alcohol amazingly well. I'd really like to try this fresh from the source to give me an idea as to how old this was. I suspect this was quite old, as there wasn't even the slightest bit of hops present."
"I'll give this one the benefit of the doubt that it just might be an older bottle. I'd like to try it again if I know i have a fresh batch."
"O: great beer from a Colorado brewery that I had never heard of untiI i moved to Texas from California!"
"Overall I must say that this bottle is much better than the first one I had a couple of years ago. Don't know if this one is fresh, as Breckenridge doesn't bottle date, but it is much more enjoyable then I remember. It really has more of a Barleywine vibe to it but not a bad interpretation. Thanks to Jonathan for this hard earned sample. Even though I received this for free I must rate on price. This is a $16 six pack or an $8 bomber. For the price, you can do soooo much better."
"Purchased At: Nikki's Liquors"
"Glassware: Bomber poured into snifter"
"Overall: I paired this beer with spicy Mexican fare. Awesome taste, and very little discernible alcohol. One of the best beers I've tasted."
"Overall: Solid entry in the DIPA world, easy to drink, packs a punch. I will drink again, but there are better IPA's out there with more character. 3.5 Rating for me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a slightly orange darker amber. Had a 2 finger off white head that faded to next to nothing in about 5 minutes. The little later left some great lacings on the side of the glass. Aroma was slighty fruity that intermingled with a bitter hops. Also picked up slighty traces of a spicy vanilla. Taste was remarkably balanced. Started off hoppy with just a taste of lactose, became more malty, and then finishing up with hops again. Felt nice and solid in the mouth. Slightly creamy with a tad of tingle on the tongue at the end. Overall a great beer. Not my normal cup of tea, but very drinkable and well balanced, reasonable for the cost as well."
"Overall: Very good DIPA overall. I'll be buying more of this in the future and definitely recommend that you do the same."
"Breckenridge 471 IPA pours a mildly opaque orange. The dirty white head comes up to about three fingers in height. The lacing left behind is very nice, but retention is a little bit brief. The nose is fairly balanced, with some caramel sweetness laying a base for a note of grapefruit with a more tropical edge that has suggestions of mango. The flavor doesn't have as much of a malt base as the aroma would have suggested, but the caramel is still definitely there. I was a bit worried when I read that this beer has both Centennial and Simcoe hops, as I'm not usually a fan of either of those hops. Together though, they seem to work, as the fruitiness of the Simcoe blunts the usual aggressive edge of the Centennial's grapefruit flavor, and the pungent Centennial takes the harshness away from the Simcoe hops. The body is more than solid, it's impressively light for a 9%+ beer, and helps let the hops shine through. The carbonation is fine, enough to elevate the hop flavors and aromas, but it stops short of being bubbly. I was a little let down by my first Breckenridge beer (Vanilla Porter), but this one has made a much better impression."
"Overall it was decent, nothing to special but still very nice. with it being 9.2% it goes down very smooth, if you like Breckenridge then try it or if you are a IPA fan, if not then don't bother."
"Mouthfeel is a little too brief and dusty for my taste. I wish it would linger a bit more (like a cold in February)."
"O- good 2ipa.. but for me its 2nd tier , so many others to buy this one wont be on my radar"
"O: This is a well made, enjoyable to drink beer, it just doesn't do anything to wow me."
"O - Not bad not mind blowing eiter worth trying though."
"O: this is a really good dipa for the citrus lovers in the crowd. Its very drinkable and I could see myself putting down a growler of this while watching a movie with the GF then nut being able to walk straight to go to bed."
"O: A decent DIPA that is a little rough around the edges. I prefer more citrus/tropical fruit, a little more sweetness with less caramel and amber malt, and less noticeable booze. I'm not the biggest fan of boozy pale ales and it's definitely too strong up front."
"This beer poured out as an orange golden color. The head was fluffy and white. The lacing was really nice on the glass too. The smell was full of big hop aromas and some malts in the back end. The taste of th beer had a citrusy pine flavor upfront and faded into a slight earthy flavor. The mouthfeel was very nice on this one. Overall it's a solid IPA. Well worth looking into."
"MF: Big-bodied and full but with lots of refreshing characteristics making it a smooth drinker"
"D - This is a really nice Double IPA... Stellar appearance and mouthfeel... Very good flavor and drinkable... Slightly above average aroma... The total package is quite impressive and will lead me to try some additional Breckridge offerings which I have been procrastinating on... Nicely done..."
"O: Overall a toasted, tasty, and well hopped ipa that has a nice balance making for a very good drinking experience. Very good overall, solid, and would drink on a regular basis. sixtal worthy."
"Excellent IPA! Opened this bottle at about 50 F. Poured a nice, foamy, frothy, fluffy, thick, cream to light tan colored head that quickly setted down a light cover with some islands of thicker suds and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is hops, malt, caramel, fruit, fresh baked rye bread. Flavor is similar with high points for the each of the charactersitics in different parts of the mouth. Body is superb - full yet slightly astringent and has significant alcohol warmth. Finish is like flavor and is long. Session beer, but for being careful as it tastes so good that I want a large draught, but know it'll kick my butt."
"D - I like IPA's and thus I like drinking this one."
"a pretty good beer. this was the second double IPA I tried after the Hercules IPA. pretty bitter, which I like. good lacing on the glass and an overall pleasant taste. Would definitely drink it again if I encountered it, but for the price, not a beer I would seek out again immediately. overall, pretty solid!"
"O: For a double IPa it was nothing special compared to other DIPA's I have had, not to interested in trying it again."
"This is my favorite of the beers I've tried from this brewery so far. It's a darn fine DIPA and worthy of purchasing again for sure."
"Overall a decent middle of the road DIPA. Not much to distinguish it from others of its kind, but it is an easy drinking, deceptively drinkable beer."
"On the take home scale I would say this lives up to the relative high price and ould be an excellent beer to share with someone who likes IPAs."
"Overall a good quality IPA. I enjoyed this one. Definitely wouldn't mind drinking this one again."
"Overall Drinkability - Good for an IPA and good for a beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty standard DIPA. I'll give it bonus points for the well masked strength."
"I look forward to trying more from this brewery. They work hard in putting out a decent product, and I would like to see where they progress."
"Was never able to pull the trigger on this one, but getting one in a trade made it much easier. It pours a very lightly hazy light-amber-straw topped by a finger of cream white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, light caramel, white bread, very light honey, and a touch of pine. The taste leans more toward the caramel and honey, but finishes with some prominent orange peel, grapefruit peel, pine, and cantaloupe. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally dry finish. Overall, a nice DIPA, with an enjoyable balance between the malts and the hops. The only thing holding it back is a lack of something...special (if that makes sense). It's all pretty good, but nothing stands out about it, even the goodness. Definitely worth a drink, though."
"This beer is thicker than I expected, and it also has a very nice (low) level of carbonation to keep it going down smooth."
"Very drinkable for the abv but feels too one-dimensional given the hopping profile it's touted to have. Definitely a DIPA, not upset I tried it, but not one I'd look for again."
" It had a good hop nose coming from it pine and citrus. I classify this as a good balanced DIPA the malts and hops blend perfectly with a slight edge given to the hops in the flavor department. It was a decent DIPA and I would drink it again"
"well, I'm glad i tried it once, and I'm glad i found it in a 12oz serving rather than a 22oz. not off-putting, but not quite what I look for in my strong/double IPAs. balanced? kinda. tasty? kinda. something worth seeking out? unfortunately not."
"Due to a lack of flavor, 471 is forgetable and can not be included in the discussion about great double IPAs that are so common now."
"Aroma is strong and fairly hoppy with a surprisingly sweet, but far from cloying, fruity undertone that is mainly sour orange plus some apple, pear and grapefruit. It pours a clear coppery amber with a respectable cream-white head that has a copper tint. Flavor is what I expect from a quality IPA: quite hoppy, only a little bitter, fruity and slightly sour undertone, just a hint of honey sweetness. Fruity component is mostly sour orange plus a bit of pear. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, and it leaves a nice tingly and hoppy finish. Small batch? Taste the love!"
"A hop lovers delight. Well balanced and drinkable. It hides its 9.2% abv well."
"Overall this is an ok dipa, but I wasn't feeling it as a top dipa. Would choose a lot over this."
"Notes: Another early encounter with Breckenridge in DC and a rather welcome one. This is a good DIPA to have around."
"Overall - I think I will enjoy this one more during the colder months."
"O- Very good..my first brew from Breckenridge..would love to try some of there year round beers..cheers"
"I poured this into a tulip it pours a nice hazy off orange with a nice head and laceing, smell was of pine and kinda earthy, taste was not bad for the style but I've had much better, I would drink this again as the abv is nice and it fits in my fav. Style"
"Finish: Bitter hops all over my palate and cheeks with a nice stickiness on the lips"
"Overall a tasty and user friendly spicy hop bomb."
"First sip is a bit mellower than what I expected..all except for a big oily hop flavor that comes through in the nick of time. Similarly, the mouthfeel is mellow, yet still with enough kick to make it worthwhile. A very good DIPA to be sure."
"Overall: A very enjoyable DIPA and worth picking up. Could definitely be a go-to when the mood strikes when it's on the shelves. Great flavors, nose is good (better on tap, but this is typically the case with this style), and the mouth is where it should be -- not too light, but not overly heavy and thick. Good stuff."
"O: I won't be trying this one again."
"Exceeded expectations. Not in the upper echelon of DIPAs, but well worth a try."
"O: Pretty average I would say -not the worst double IPA, but there are a lot of other double IPAs out that are better."
"Draft to snifter. Good. Not bad, not great; just good. Good color, good flavor, good mouthfeel. Smell is too subtle for its type. Otherwise, it's a good beer to drink. It just faces some stiff competition these days in the world of double IPAs, and it doesn't set itself apart..."
"A good beer, but not one that I'd choose for everyday."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Easily drinkable and medium bodied. The musty bitterness of the hops is quite unpleasant and makes the beer seem very old and not fresh at all."
"Drink- Overall a nice DIPA in a small bottle. Glad this one wasnt a 22 oz. I think the aftertaste would have become too much."
"D - Man, I wonder what this would be like fresh. That tropical notes would really make this killer. This is a good DIPA, just dont let it get a few months on it."
"I'd buy this in a pack if I can find it, keep it on hand for those days that are only fixed with a DIPA."
"This pours a very hazy orange with a frothy white head that leaves some lace. On the nose there are citrus notes and pine resin with some bready malts underneath. In the mouth the oranges come up to the front with a huge bitterness coating the tongue all around and hanging on for a huge, long finish. The body is medium-full, and the bitterness from the hops hang around forever. Overall this is an okay DIPA, not my favorite, not super complex, but not a bad beer."
"D average IPA. Not much added not much gained. to make a """small batch""" didnt added anything to make this IPA stand out at all IMO"
"Would still drink it again."
"drinkability is a bit on the average side. A thick, bitter, 9.2% IIPA."
"This Double IPA is best described as unbalanced. As a big fan of the style, Breckenridge misses the mark on a few different levels; a disappointment."
"I've had better examples of this style for the same price or less."
"Much better beer than the other breckenridges I have had. I would order this anytime."
"Full hop flavor as well as good bitterness. Hops dominate the malt. Very tasty. The best so far from the brewery."
"My favorite of Brackenridge. Might be a little overpriced at $15 a six pack though. Other double IPA's seem to pack a bigger punch."
"471 is bitter enough for a DIPA, but it's just not flavorful enough."
"I want more!"
"Lots of grapefruit hop bitterness. It dominates the swallow and makes the aftertaste last a very long time. Less pronounced is the lighter crystal malts giving the brew some complexity. There's an oiliness to the mouthfeel, but it isn't really rich. The carbonation is lower than most. Interestingly, I don't detect any alcohol."
"I got very excited when I first opened the bottle and poured the beer. the smell was very nice. It had a pleasant yet not overwhelming hop aroma. Mild citrus aroma. The taste was a little bit of a let down. It did not quite have the kick that I hoped it would have. The malt character was very present, and it has an overall good flavor. I thought it would have more hop """kapow""" being """double hopped""". The aftertaste is pleasant. The beer was also a little under carbonated in my opinion, but it may just have been this specific bottle. Not a bad beer, but not worth the $9.00 I paid in New Hampshire for the 22 oz. bottle either."
"I would get it again, but I would assure the date was closer to the bottling (ie, I'll drink it at the brewery next time)."
"Drink is ok at best the hops start to get fairly bitter, despite a drier finish a bit of sticky feel, touch off booze, and that weird mineral herbal hop flavor."
"D- You don't even notice the alcohol... This would go great with sooo many foods! Sweet and sour chicken w/ pork fried rice... BBQ'd citrus shrimp and polenta... or a nice crisp salad with grilled chicken, grapefruit, and feta... easily drinkable... I gotta get more of this for sure!"
"A great double IPA from Breckenridge, just an enjoyable brew that hits all the right bases."
"Not a very impressive IPA, drinkable for a hop head, but nothing to search for."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I would love to find some more of this and keep it stocked all the time."
"This is ok but I would certainly drink something else instead of it."
"Smooth dispute the high alcohol and manages to keep a crisp light mouthfeel. Very pleasant to sip. I find it to be quite drinkable"
"Drinkable for an IPA, especially one with this level of humulus alpha acids."
"The body is light to moderate. Nice velvet undertones for a 9% beer. Overall a limited hop IPA beer but very easy to drink, which could be trouble."
"D - Thought my sink was gonna spit this back up."
"12oz bottle American Double Imperial IPA. Poured a dark golden haze color with a good foamy head - very attractive yummy appearance. Smell consisted of sweet and citrusy hops. Tasted a smooth big hop characteristic flavor, but only to realize this beer is kinda solvent. Mouthability consisted of a nice full body and ongoing carbonation that left layers of laces after each drink. Freshness at its finest! Drinkability left a very dangerous impression especially for a DIPA as this beer is not as bitter as most purist DIPA beers. This was my #1 DIPA at one time until I had the 3f Dreadnaught among others over the years, but the 471 IPA remains to be one of my favorites in this particular category as I am a fan of smooth malty characteristic mouthness. Two thumbs up."
"It reminded me of Fruit Stripe Gum."
"Had this one on tap at the brewery location at 471 Kalamath in Denver. Poured a dark golden color, with a rocky little white head. Aromas of freshly plucked pine needles and freshly peeled citrus. Light to medium bodied, with flavors of citrusy hops, caramel and bready malts. Not a great beer, but works well with the great BBQ."
"D: This is a solid and quite drinkable DIPA that masks its abv nicely. I will revisit..."
"overall, this is a good beer I really enjoyed it"
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but this was nevertheless a pretty solid DIPA from Breckenridge."
"Drinkability (4): I've drank several of these at a time, but only because I don't see it around or it was the best beer available. I don't think I'd drink more than one or two of these, but only because it's a little too sweet for my tastes currently and there are better DIPAs out there. It goes down easy for 9.2% even though it's somewhat apparent to a discerning palate (or nose more accurately)."
"Pinkish-copper hued with ample off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Hazy, mostly still with only a bit of lacing left on the glass. Enticing planty citrus aroma with a mix of resinous pine thrown in as well. Little or no malt detectable. Bitter hop flavor, but without much character to go with it. Hints of citrus and a bit more floral plant flavor. Slight caramel malt flavor. Medium body, bitter but pleasant mouthfeel. A good beer, nicely hoppy, but with 9.2% ABV, wheres all the malt flavor and body?"
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a little bit of foamy white head. The aroma is strong with floral hops and malted barley. The taste is heavy with hoppy bitterness which overwhelms everything else. The mouthfeel is a little harsh for my liking... Little overcarbonated. Lingering bitter taste also detracts from the experience."
"This is definitely my favorite offering from Breckenridge. I've always been very impressed w/ 471. Unique beer, recommended!"
"For me, this is a hit or miss. I can think of several other DIPA's I'd grab before this, but this one wasn't poorly crafted by any means. Just lacked identity IMO. Plenty of bitter without a unique calling card."
"Medium body, smooth with a light fizz. This is a good base-line IPA, but would not be my first choice given a selections of popular India Pale Ales. It is one that, for an IPA afficiando, would be fine if everything else on the list was lager."
"T - Piney, bitter hops with hints of citrus. A big, sweet toffee/caramel malt backbone. The finish is very sweet."
"Overall - Nice double IPA, easy to drink, and worthy of the imperial moniker. Will definitely drink again with a friend. Call it...an 8.5"
"Had no idea this was a double IPA until I looked it up online (I know, I know, it's on the label). A bit disappointed in the lack of hops I expected to find, and the sweetness I was met with instead."
"D: @ 9.2% ABV and the touch of booziness hurts the drinkability a bit, but I will gladly have one more 12 oz. bottle."
"D: Very drinkable."
"In the end it leaves a bit to be desired but I would drink it regularly if there weren't cheaper, better alternatives."
"Drinkable, but off the style so not a keeper."
"Very drinkable for a DIPA, but I prefer their Deadlift which has more of a grapefruit flavor."
"U no it...another lovely big hop bomb, often overlooked, not fully appreciated!! Here's the deal for me...in Denver you can get a growler re-fill for around $12-14, and this is a double IPA with nice balance. Is it a Pliney...no! Is it a Green Flash, Hercules...no. It's a nicely balanced Breckenridge double IPA that holds up nicely pint after pint, which is why I regularly fill mine. A fine, wholesome big hop profile with depth...hummm..yummm. Ayieee!!!"
"Taste-Tangerine/orange fruitiness, malt sweetness, underlying but not overly harsh hop bitterness. Decently balanced and pretty drinkable with the alcohol well hidden. Overall, a decent, and affordable DIPA."
"Pours dark orange with a one-finger tan head that disintegrates fairly quickly, leaving some thick fingers of lace behind. Sweet and malty to the nose with some earthiness and ripened fruitiness at the back. Has a big malty, creamy middle which is wrapped tightly with some striking citrusy and piny hop bitterness. A bit of coriander and orange peel is noticed in the very back. Mouth-feel is medium. Alcohol heat hits quickly, and fades just as fast, leaving nothing but a near perfect mix of sweet and bitter to linger on the palate. Double IPA's are a dime a dozen these days, but this one is a keeper."
"Lingering bitter aftertaste."
"It seems like an OK clone of 90 Minute IPA. Since I live much closer to DFH than Breckenridge and actual 90 Minute IPA (or for that batter Two Hearted Ale) is much cheaper I see no reason to seek it out."
"D: Very drinkable for a 9.2%."
"D: This Double IPA is smooth and easy to drink, but with its similarities to a barleywine and the fact that I've had many other Double IPAs that I like better, I'd say this brew is fairly average."
"The body is light-medium, with a sticky feel. Carbonation isn't aggressive, but keeps things crisp through the finish. Overall it's pretty easy to drink....granted 9.2%. A bit more spunk could have boosted it, but it's a solid IPA."
"D- getting better the deeper i get into this beer although I have a feeling the by the end of number two I'd be ready for something not quite as sweet and candylike 89/100"
"D - Easy drinker for the first couple. Very tasty."
"D - There is a lot going on here in this beer. Big hop and malt presence that battle it out with the malt taking the win by a little bit. Alcohol is on the high side and somewhat noticeable. A pretty interesting DIPA that is a bit out of the norm, but mostly works. Glad to try this and wouldn't mind having another, but I don't need to go out of my way to try this again either."
"D - High ABV, but the booze hides well."
"This is a great double IPA, it's very tasty."
"Glad I gave this one a try. Decent Imperial IPA for a good price."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, but it also is one of those beers that sneaks up on you and kicks your butt without knowing."
"D - Scary drinkable. Flavors are so easy to drink, but the alcohol will slow you down. Not filling."
"Overall this was one of the first beers I had when really getting into craft beer and it still remains a very solid beer. Not quite up to par with the real big boys but it can easily hold it's own. Worth a shot."
"D: Goes down relatively easily, not too filling, nice kick, nice representation of style. There is quite a bit of alcohol wamring to this beer. A bomber is more than sufficient."
"D- Good balance between malt and hops means no hop burn-out. However, even at 9.2% abv, the alcohol could have been better hidden. The balance almost makes me think of this as a really hoppy barley wine. It's a definite sipper and a good nightcap."
"Nowhere near the top of the style, but I can still drink more than one."
"Mouthfeel is full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip opaque burnt orange with a 1.5 finger kinda off white foaming head. Good retention and lacing. The scent is of a balance floral and sugary scent. The taste has a little bit of a strong carmel flavor that doesn't really ever get to the bitter flavors that I would expect for the style. It keeps leading me on that it's coming but I never do find the bitters. The mouthfeel is pretty solid for the style, not too thin. And the alcohol is hidden very nicely making this a decently drinkable IIPA, if you like searching for hops."
"D: Nowhere in the upper echelon of great DIPAs is going to be, but it's not half bad. There's enough orange in this, it's almost like DIPA punch, worth a shot, one of the least expensive DIPAs out there. It's a bit of a boozy mess, but it's fun."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Worth trying at least once if you have access. It is a decent hunt but not a top priority."
"D: This Double Hopped IPA is extremely drinkable as a double IPA to introduce someone to the style. It has the ridiculous notes of hops required to be included in the style, but enough sweetness to satisfy the palate of a new double IPA drinker. The amazing pine hop flavors are met by a powerful orange zest, bringing dry and sweet together excellently. Its appearance and smell do not stand out much from other beers, but the other characteristics are satisfying and enjoyable."
"Drinkability - I love IPAs but found it too sweet to drink too many"
"Kef"
"Poured a golden-orange hue, with a finger of off-white head; decent lacing. Very pineapple-y in the nose, with some apricot, malt, and alcohol essence. The taste confirmed what I had suspected in the nose; the flavor was so sour pineapple that it was borderline diacetal. Combine that with a thick'ish, modestly carbonated body, and it felt as if I was drinking the the residue at the bottom of a Dole pineapple can. Tough to drink, but given the fact that it did taste like a bottling issue occurred with the batch, I'd give this beer a second chance if I come across it again."
"D- Decent. This goes down well and you could have quite a few, but I expect with the ABV you don't want to be driving."
"Mouthfeel is a little flat for me. Drinkability is pretty good. It packs a punch with the ABV of 9.2%"
"This is my second review for this beer which has been totally re-written. The beer I reviewed a year or so ago was a malt bomb unfortunately, compared to the bottle that's sitting in front of me. This D-IPA is capable of holding it's own with no problem. If you can find it, I'd definitely seek it out. I'm literally, blown away by how good this bottle is drinking right now. The previous bottle I had drank well, but it was far maltier. Comparing a fresh bottle to the older, maltier one I had, the overall score just jumped an entire grade to a solid """A"". Great job, Breckenridge!"
"Though definately present, the alcohol is well masked by the malts."
"D: Decent drinkability. Not sure if the bottles were old as there was no date on them. Bought them on a trip to Cleveland and brought them back to Boston. I wonder if the hops have mellowed since it could have been on the shelf a while. Good beer, but I wonder if a fresh one has more pronounced hop flavor."
"D - Indeed. Enough character to be interesting and thirst-quenching enough to have after mowing the lawn."
"D- a nice brew to put back. It goes down smooth and you might forget the high abv."
"Future outlook: Solid beer- definitely not one to turn down, though probably not inspiring enough of a DIPA to seek out again."
"Poured a clear orange into tulip style pint glass. Very little head with minimal to no lacing. Smelled of hops and citrus fruit (grapefruit). Taste was on par with the aroma. Hops and citrus all the way through. Full mouthfeel...a bit oily from the hops. This beer hides its alcohol very well. Never would have guess that it clocks in at 9.2%. Definitely wouldn't mind having this around on a regular basis."
"D: A pretty nice DIPA. The hops form a nice ensemble cast that provides a few different flavors/perspectives. Could stand to have a slightly mellower alcoholic presence, as it distracts slightly from the beer at the moment. Regardless, certainly worth a try if you're at all a fan of the style."
"A very mild but drinkable DIPA at 9%, goes down easy without to much palate destruction, so be careful if you order another..."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty drinkable."
" While I think by all the characteristics I could certainly have a few of these in one session. However, if I want to keep my wits, one is nice; but letting my guard down with this beer is never out of the realm of possibilities!"
"Overall - Well balanced beer. The hops are not over the top, but they have to be in there in numbers in order to balance that well with the grain bill. Very impressive """hidden""" alcohol. Smooth drinking."
"Still. A solid beer"
"Purs a decent mid-color copper with a bit of initial head; no lasting head and very little lacing. Nice scent, a lot of hops in the nose; citrus and grass detected; some sweet maltiness, but it wasn't enough to counter the hops. Decent taste, a lot of hoppiness; citrus leading to grass/pine, with a mixture aftertaste; decent malt backing, but not near as much as needed for the hops, and seems a bit malt weak for such a high ABV. A bit rough from the hops."
"Odd flavor at first, almost like a wet dog. Finishes dry. Mostly sweet. My first impression on the taste were pretty bad, I need to try again. OK, that was better, forward sweetness, some bitterness in the back, still finishes a little dry but not too bad. Bitterness builds and lingers. There is some hop flavor in the midpalate and the carbonation in the mouth helps. Its OK."
"Overall, a fantastic IIPA that isn't over the top like some others can be. That probably hurts its rating with some, but the drinkability is better than most beers of this style. That said, it still tastes like your standard IIPA. Which isn't bad, but it doesn't set itself apart in any way."
"d: very drinkable and could see myself getting a nice buzz off a few of these."
"Not a particularly complex tasting beer but what it lacks in that department, it makes up for in punch. Good beer-"
"Definitely one I'd reach for again."
"Pours a deep dark amber color with moderate levels of carbonation. The aroma is fairly balanced between malty and hoppy. The flavor begins with the same balance, but then erupts with a hop explosion. Massive piney hop flavor with a healthy medium body. The finish is a bit too bitter as the hops continue all the way until the end. Leaves a slight tart hoppy aftertaste."
"Small batch DIPA is a great brew, Nicely hopped and almost a perfect balance without a overly malted finish. The 9.2 does not come into play at all in taste/feel but I could feel this after my 12oz's. Not very sessionable, but i'll go for two. This has just enough hops to cover up what small metal taste I get from this brewery so it hides that well. Good for a go and good enough for a 2nd purchase."
"My pour created a rocky finger of ecru head with decent retention, which created some nice lacing as it dissipated. Color was a slightly hazy deep-amber with copper highlights. Nose was piney and very pungent at that. Mouthfeel was fairly full, almost creamy on the tongue with a most welcome astringent hop bite in the mouth. I have been subjecting myself to a LOT of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers of late and this was a refreshing change. Finish was dry and quite hoppy. I have really come to miss IPAs during this part of the CANQuest and this was one reason why. More please, sir."
"Pours up a slightly cloudy rusty orange colour with a really nice, thick, frothy head that laced the edges of my glass nicely. So far, things look good. Smell is a lovely floral hops with juicy, citrus fruits. Very nice. The citrus floral marriage continues on the palate and tongue with a full on frontal assault with brutal hop savagery and little detectable malt. This is typically not exactly my favourite style, but occasionally I really enjoy a super hoppy, American style IPA, and I really enjoyed this beer. I must say, too, that it drinks miles below its proclaimed 9,2%. I personally wouldn't drink a whole lot of these simply because I'm not a big hop guy. However, I gave it big marks on drinkability based on how stunningly well concealed the abv is. A really solidly well built American-style IPA."
"This is a great IPA, delicious and enjoyable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall not exactly what I hoped for. I'm going to be nursing this bomber for awhile."
"D-This is a nice beer; went down a bit too fast for a double IPA, but I guess that means it is pretty drinkable. However, I was expecting it to be a bit more """in you face""" for the style. If I hadn't known the style, I would have pegged it for a single IPA or possibly even a pale ale."
"All in all this didn't fair all that well with aging. It's definitely interesting, but from what I remember of this beer fresh, and from reading my previous review, this hasn't gotten better and has probably gotten worse. None of the citrus or floral hops are there at all, most of what's left is a very strong alcohol flavor. A great beer when it's fresh but not one I'd age again."
"Not a great IIPA, worth trying once but way too malty."
"D: overall a fantastic beer that's great for beer geeks but a little too strong for the casual drinker"
"Nice mouthfeel, full medium body. Alright carbonation, smooth and pretty drinkable. Not the best neither the worst DIPA. Enjoyable."
"Not bad, not great. There are so many great DIPAs out there that this one gets lost in the shuffle."
"Overall this is a pretty decent American DIPA, but it is unfortunate that the alcohol is not as hidden as it could be. Thanks again Kyle for throwing this one in the box!"
"For me personally this one's a bit too malty but it's a good beer and a good example of the style."
"Final Thought: Quite a nice brew that bolsters quality hops with a unique mix of sweet secondary flavors. Recommended!"
"Consumed on 1/20/2010"
"(for my own notes, opened this one on a cool sunday night watching the golden globe awards)"
"Smells of piney hops and sweet malt. Taste has a sweet malt backbone up front, then hops. May be able to slightly detect the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium medium. Soewhat refreshing, but also heavy. A good, well balanced DIPA."
"Poured into aan imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4""" eggshell head above the clear orangey amber brew. Head falls gradually, with excellent, slow-falling lace. Aroma is fruity citrus. Taste is sweet to start, citrus fruitiness in the middle, and closes with ample bitterness. Mouthfeel is extra smooth, and drinkability is excellent for the style. Not overboard on the bitter, good representation of the DIPA style."
"This beer is the definition of palate fatigue. Getting farther down the glass I can barely taste the beer anymore. It could warm you up in these freezing temperatures but I don't think I would drink another one of these."
"D- Like stated before, I can't believe how high the ABV was in this one. You can't even tell. Pretty good but if you had a few too many it would sneak up on you quick."
"drinkability: fine"
"I like it, and I'd like to try it on draft or cask. I bet its awesome."
"D- Well balanced and unique tastes. Easy drinker here."
"I would probably not buy it again, but if i was in the mood for a strong IPA taste I would."
"Libation: I expected good things here, but I was a tad disappointed. A very nice hoppy introductions gives way to simple unbalanced bitterness afterward. Not a bad brew by any means, but not one I'd recommend without caveats."
"Got a 6 pack for under $7 because the store had too many in stock or something...I'll take it.!"
"This is an outstanding beer. It may have overtaken Titan as my favorite. I will certainly seek this one out."
"Picked up at local beer store, $15.00 for a six pack. Curious what the 417 stands for. Pretty potent DIPA here. A= Poured a darker golden coor with about a fingerwidth of head. S=Pretty good here, not as good as some other IPA like Great Divide-Hercules of Dog Fish Head-90 Minute. T=It was good but not great taste. About an average flavor with potent bitterness without anything to even it out. Little to no sweetness and alcohol tatse is present. M=Decent as far as not to dry buy strong lingering finish. D=Could maybe drink 2 but Im impatient and would have to search for something better. Priced way to high for this flavor."
"D - drinks like a dream. definately a sleeper DIPA. what a pleasant surprise from a hometown hero. GO Breckenridge!"
"I was hoping for something great from this one and was let down. Way to dry and bubbly in the mouthfeel department and even though you get hit with a good blast from the hops the beer isn't balanced well. Has an unwelcome off flavor in the background and the taste and feel was more like a regular IPA. Another letdown from Breckenridge which in my opinion is so far in my experience a mediocre craft brewery. This is a decent high abv IPA but lack many characteristics I have come to favor and expect from Imperial IPA's."
"My dad brought a six pack of this over to my house and the price tag was twenty-something dollars for six! Is this right? The most I've ever paid is $17.99 for Bell's Hop Slam. I guess the hop shortage is to blame for the cost of these double IPAs. I'm pouring the last bottle into my pint glass. It's got a light copper color with a dense creamy off-white head that has varying sizes of bubbles that won't go away. The smell almost wants to make me sneeze. I feel as if my allergies are going to be activated. It's heavy on the hops (of course), very pine cone-like, and sour citrusy like old grapefruit. I like it. Heavy oily texture with a bitter bite. Tastes like pine tree sap that has been thinned out with grapefruit juice and a regular stregnth IPA. Wow. You really have to like this style to appreciate the complexities of this beer. The foam is stuck to the side of the glass as I sip it down. I have to say that I really like this beer but only one or two of them at a time. The drinkability is not its strongpoint but then again it's not supposed to be. alcohol warmth is felt in my throat as well as the begining of a warm glow everywhere."
"Different take on an IPA, nice job."
"Drinkability isn't bad. Alcohol isn't really in the forefront, taste is nice and balanced, though it is a bit syrupy."
"Overall I am very disappointed. Maybe I drank it too warm, but I'm not too sure I will even finish the bomber. Overpowering alcohol and very little complexity. I hate to bag on a brew, but this was bad."
"I thought it was a little watery, not quite enough body for the style, I like a little more medium body. This may have helped the drinkability though, as it went down smooth, and helped disguise the 9% abv."
"Note: Drink at 55-60F for the best flavor."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is suspect, as a DIPA I think it falls short, but as an IPA or even an APA it would do better, but still not among the greats"
"Beer poured orange with a nice white head. Nose is all about those fresh wonderful floral hops. Taste is a wonderful, nice malt backbone finishing with a blend of piney and citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied, well balanced, and pretty clean in the finish. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very smooth well balanced beer with a well hidden abv. Definitely try if you are into imperial ipa's."
"D: Easy drinking, abv is very well masked."
"not much to the mouthfeel. which i like. slight hop oilyness but nothing much else. i consider this beer very drinkable due to its well masked abv and easy availability."
"Let me begin by saying I am not a fan of the regular line-up of Breckenridge beers. They seem simple, safe and pretty unremarkable. 471 changes my mind however. A nice, rich honey color sitting lazily in the glass. Good lacing; it says I was here and left my mark proudly. The aroma is remarkably subduded for a heavy-hitting DIPA. Smells like hops, but not pungent hops. It is sort of a distant, echoed growl that warns you of the dangers should you enter this dragon's lair. Mmmm. I like the wyrm. Rich, full sweeter malt flavors with rigid hop backing. I would call it 'malt-centric' without caring if that is a real word or not. Reminds me of Stoudts DIPA in a good way. Drinkability is delightful for a nearly 10% abv. Drinking this without knowing yourself could result in awkward apologizes in the morning. That said, nice job Breckenridge."
"D - In spades, but the high ABV detracts."
"A very good (and dangerous) beer. Although I'd call this an Imperial IPA!"
"I love the style but the drinkability overall for this style is off the mark not one that I will aggressively pursue but worth a shot especially compared to other offerings from Breckenridge."
"Edit 08-23-2009. Just had another bottle and it was quite fantastic. It appears to be a slightly inconsistent brew. My wife was drinking a bottle right next to me, hers was clear and mine was cloudy. This time around the beer was very good in the flavor department. Nicely hoppy, sweet malty and bittered. Much better this time around."
"Pours a clear amber with a one finger head that quickly reduces to a collar. The taste, to me, is less hoppy and more malty. The aroma was sweet, with some alcohol entering the picture as it warmed. The taste was more sweet than bitter, in fact, no bitterness on the tongue, only a bit of bitter aftertaste at the back of the throat. A late note on taste: The sweet was a vanilla sweet, to me. Really not like an imperial IPA at all (not complaining). Feel was medium bodied with very little carbonation. Drinkability was good for a 9.2 ABV."
"Wow this is what you expect when you order up a Dipa!! I'm surprised most of the other reviews said this was so drinkable. Don't get me wrong I loved it but this is one you sip not flip. I guess some would say it's an over the top hop bomb, but isn't that what you want when you order up a double. I reccomend highly you find on tap and belly up for one hell of a ride."
"Orange amber with a fine creamy sand colored head that leaves sheets of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is pine sap, toasted grain slathered in caramel and citrusy grapefruit rind. The flavors mirror the nose with an onslaught of fresh juicy hops and caramel malt. The 9.2% ABV is well hidden. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. This stuff rules, too bad it is so expensive these days(around $18.99 a sixer in Indy) I can't afford to drink it on a regular basis like I used to."
"I really enjoy this beer. It has a great hop sweetness balance. I don't mind the alcohol feel so much, the sweetness is not overdone to cover it up."
"One of those bland overly bitter DIPA's. Nothing offensive if you like the style, but nothing I would recommend. There are much better examples of the style. That is coming from someone that is not a big fan of DIPA's."
" If you have not sampled this beer, grab a six pack and share with your fellow BA's. A great brew to style, well worth a try (or 6)."
"Got this in a bullet keg for home. Appearance was a little darker than I expected; more of a dark copper than your typically hazy orange DIPA. Lots of hops in the nose. Smell loads of pine, citrus, and floral hops. Taste is really smooth for a DIPA, very well balanced malt and hops. With almost no alcohol burn, this is a dangerous DIPA. Extremely drinkable, this one is an exceptional DIPA on draft."
"D=alcohol is not overly evident, though the ABV is limiting drinkability or sessionability. However I do find this beer to be enjoyable in its quietness."
"Served: in an imperial pint glass."
"D - I'm giving this an okay drinkability only because I feel the malts came in as the beer warmed up...the beer is a little better when it's warm...but the 9.2% ABV shines through"
"Decent example of the style. Although there are better options out there IMO."
"Overall, good hop character but a bomber is way too much. I'm not sure if I would even want tweleve ounces of this. I think I have a headache."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for as thick and heavy as this beer is. Carbonation is perfect. Very drinkable. Maybe dangerously."
"I would not pick this one up again, maybe I got a bad bottle or something."
" more crispness."
"D - the high ABV on this one limits the drinkability a bit. But considering it's almost 10%, a very nice, well balanced beer with some nice flavors going on."
"Somewhat cloudy dark orange color. Lots of lacing and decent head retention. The aroma is loaded with citrus hops and orange peel. On first taste I am very surprised, not the overbearing hop bomb I expected. There is alot of bitterness upfront but this is surprisingly well balanced. Lots of sweet malt in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little bit thick and the taste is a little boozy. High ABV makes this one to keep an eye on."
"What a wonderful beer put out by the boys in breckenridge."
"D- I would be hard pressed to guess this beer was 9.2% Very easy to get yourself into trouble quickly with this one."
"Overall: This is PERFECT with my spicy jalapeno-pesto-mushroom (MM's """Magical Mystery Tour""") pizza. A definite keeper."
"Note: I had this beer as it was the Pint Night beer at the Flying Saucer in Houston. I didn't take notes, so this will be a rather brief review. Ordinarily I wouldn't do a review off of memory but as this was rather unique in my experience, I wanted to post about it."
"D- It' a good IPA and the 9% allows for some drinkability factor here. I could have gone for another after having this one."
"D- Goes pretty quick when I'm in the mood for a refreshing IPA with a bit of a kick to get the evening started."
""
"D: I'm surprised this a DIPA. Just seems to be lacking too much in both flavor and density to be considered a DIPA. But, with that said, the alcohol is well hidden and the lighter body and simple flavor does lend this beer to being quite drinkable. While I am not impressed with this beer in relation to the DIPA style, I am very impressed with it's drinkability."
"D - Great beer to enjoy. Would not turn this one down at a pub or bar."
"D - One nice little beer."
"This was a good beer, but as I stated above it was a little too balanced for my liking."
"D - I found this to be a fine DIPA with a nice balanced flavor and apparent dry hopped character."
"D - It's light and smooth, but the bite and burn makes you slow down. Slowing down is a good thing at 9+%"
"D: Not the most drinkable, but in small amounts a real tasty treat."
"Not the best example I have tried."
"pours a murky burnt orange with a 1.5 finger head wich left a good amount of lacing down the glasss. smells of booze and tropical fruit. the taste is where this beer lost me it was very salty bitter and hints of metal. as the beer warmed up more it lost the metal taste but became more boozy and even more salty. mouthfeel was suprisingly kind of thin which made it more drinkable to me. overall this will be the last 471 ipa i will be buying."
"Drinkability: If these monsters weren't over 9% ABV, I'd take the entire 6-pack in a heartbeat. This is a very smooth DIPA. Gotta love those CO beers!"
"Pours golden, clear, with a thick head of off-white froth. Nice aroma of citrus. Taste is very crisp and fresh for so high an ABV. Tastes more like the 6-7% Sweetwater IPA that is my everyday brew. Medium-bodied. Good balance of citrusy bitter hops and sweet malt graininess. Some grass, some butter, some cloves. Overall, an appealing, complex brew."
"D - pretty decent and a unique tasting IPA, although I couldn't drink too many"
"i wouldnt say this is overly drinkable if you have some other decent options around...im glad i tried it and thats about it"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, though I'm sure the 9.2 ABV would catch up with you if putting down a 6-pk in short order (which could be done with this one)."
"D - Definitely sessionable, definitely a more balanced IPA that shades on the """West Coast""" side. Definitely a good beer."
"This beer is easy to drink, very enjoyable."
"This poured a nearly clear gold with light tan head. It smelled like copper hops with some apricot and light wheat malt. It tasted like rusty copper and dry bitter resin, with strong bready yeast and alcohol, and a bit of citrus. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a weird smell and flavor that didn't seem right for the style. It had good body, but it had strong alcohol flavor that made it tough to drink. The flavor was fairly dirty also (hops and malt weren't fresh or clean tasting). I'm not a fan."
"I really liked this beer. Bought it by chance at a local """Binny's""". Poured a nice dark amber. Scent was citrussy hops. Taste was wonderfully sweet with a nice grapefruit citrus that remained as the back end dried nicely. I will be drinking this again, Hell, I might even move to Denver."
"Drinkability: Medium? It is drinkable, there are just better options. Glad I got to try it though, and I would love to have something like this at bars. The alcohol is very, very well hidden, I had no idea it was 9.2%"
"Poured out of the silk screened bottle into a sam adams glass at 50 degrees. Clear, copper, with a dissipating ivory head that leaves some lacing behind. Smells fruity, with earthy hops and I'm sensing the 9.2%. That comes through with the initial taste, and I can't seem to get fruit punch off my mind. The piney hops never quit, but it is a little sweet which hinders its drinkability. I am enjoying the mouthfeel as the hops are giving my mouth a bit of a sting with moderate carbonation. Nice, however I don't see myself seeking this one out. Good to try this DIPA at least once."
"Poured a slight hazy orange with a thick, foamy off-white head. Great floral aromas with pine, and strong hops. First sip is thick on tha palate and coats nicely and leaves a pleasant, oily residue. Flavors are piny, with a hop bitterness that almost reaches the breaking point, but is then nicely balanced with a floral sweetness reminiscent of fresh honey. Nice malt balance with a great spicy finish. Really enjoyed this one. A roller-coaster of flavors with good balance!"
"i liked this offering. definitely worth trying and revisiting~!"
"Doing some sampling and this was by far the best beer of the day. Poured with just a slight cloudiness and a rich amber, almost orange color. Big bold hop flavor with a slight taste of fruit (orange) that did not overpower the hops. It was very strong yet did not have any lingering aftertaste. I would have to put this beer at the top of an all-time favorite list."
"Taste: Mostly grapefruit. Also some pine and citrus peels."
"D: You could certainly do worse if you're looking for a hop fix. Not quite an exemplar of the style, but a very solid example."
"D: Not a DIPA except in ABV. But it is a good IPA and their best one-timer at the bar."
"D-Quality beer...different and exciting to me....relatively complex and immensely enjoyable..."
"A nice beer that's a little surprisingly drinkable for its style and alcohol level. A keeper in my book."
"But once it gets to your liver, it's true colors are revealed and all hell starts breaking loose. Beware."
"D: A 471 a day keeps the more expensive purchases away? Easily drinkable, and on a regular basis. Drink it nice and slowly. This is one to enjoy."
"Alcohol is mostly well hidden although it does have a slight burning presence on occasion. Overall a pretty enjoyable DIPA."
"Pretty easy to drink considering the 9.2%. I am not sure if the bottle is a little on the older side or not but the hops are on the light side but well balanced nonetheless. Not bad, I tried it a long time ago, which may be for a reason."
"Pours a dark orange body that is somewhat murky and a great two-finger head that left lace rings down the glass. While the citric and grapefruit hop aromas seem to dominate the smell (it has that clingy, zesty, soapy smell some DIPAs have) there are also sweet malt smells tucked in there. Tastes like a standard (good) DIPA, with a lighter medium-body that passes easily and smooth and leaves a citric hop taste throughout your mouth and is balanced with those sweet malts, for a dry but satisfying backbite. I did not realize that this was over 9% b/c they really did a good job hiding the alcohol."
"Enough alcohol to get you in trouble if you're not careful."
"Easily drinkable without any effort, however the 9.2% ABV is bound to catch up with you eventually!"
"On tap. Nice head and maintains it very nicely. Citrus and grapefruit dominate both on the nose and tongue, very nicely bitter, well balanced, Considering the relatively high ABV definitely not boozy and it's well hidden. Knocked down the drink ability a tab because of the high ABV, but it's dangerously drinkable. Note: the bottle didn't equal the tap."
"D: A pretty good DIPA. Nothing stellar however. The bitterness is that of an IPA. The maltiness is that of a DIPA. This didn't fit the style particularly well. Additionally, I think I paid $12.99 for a six pack. This is definitely not worth the price when I can get Hopslam or another iconic DIPA for the same price or less. On tap, this may be worth another try. I won't be picking it up in a bottle again."
"Overall, a really delicious beer. I usually review the first or second beer from a pack, and enjoy the rest, but I greedily drank the first 5, and had to force myself to review the remaining 1. Tremendous flavor, especially if you disregard style, which I seem to be doing more and more. And the high, yet unnoticeable ABV makes this a solid choice for enjoying your evening. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a delicious double/imp. I am glad I picked it up. It is pretty easy to drink at 9.2% abv. I definitely would like to try more small batch series now!"
"M/D - not a bad tasting brew, but a bit harsh, it has a good flavor but there was something in the finish that makes me pass by this one when picking from the fridge."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding DIPA, and one that I'm surprised doesn't get talked about more. There are barely any malt flavors present, allowing the hops and citrus flavors to shine through. The bitterness of the hops remained strong throughout the beer. Great beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint with a glowing amber cloudiness. A thin white head was persistant and generated a clinging lace throughout. My sense of smell is poor so I like the punch in the nose of a pine/grapefruit hop-bomb of a DIPA. On that score, this disappoints. It smelled crisp with a hint of citrus. It flowed into my mouth with a thick rich feel. The warmth of the alcohol strikes first, followed by the sting of hops in a soft blanket of malt. The initial promise of a citrus balance goes unfulfilled. It finishes with a hot alcohol burn again mitigated by the sweetness of the malt. While the hops are clearly present, they lack the clear distinction of pine resin, instead imparting a sharp tingle. The welcome warmth of the alcohol becomes the defining (and not unpleasant) characteristic of this DIPA. Nothing wrong with this one, but other, bolder DIPAs will draw me away."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Breckenridge has fashioned a great malt-driven DIPA with a unique hop bill. An interesting beer sure to surprise anyone with a taste for the style. Very good, and something I would buy again. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"I know that I have probably had a worse DIPA than this but my experience with this one has just been a huge let down. The bottle had a pretty cool design, had heard good things about this beer in the past, and it looks pretty good too, but in the end it all just turned out average. Would recommend you turn elsewhere for a DIPA, especilly if you are looking for a hop fix."
"D: very nice brew. solid DIPA, I could drink several of these. the ABV is a little high for the drinkability, but the smoothness took it over."
"Poured from 22 oz bomber into a pint. Very effervescent, and the heavy our produced a tall, but not too dense, off-white head. A burnt orange-amber color, and rather light. Apparent hops aroma with some pine and citrus hints. Caramel background offsets the heavy amount of hops a DIPA requires. Definitely a nice balanced taste, which can be troublesome with a brew of this level of alcohol. That effervescence takes a little bit away from it in the mouth, but it is to be expected with DIPA, I guess. Guess down easy for the ABV, and definitely something I'd like to have again. Once again, from a taste and a drinkability standpoint, I am shocked this is 9.2% ABV."
"Very drinkable, a great IPA for the entry level beer enthusiast. Quite refreshing and easy to drink."
"Never the less, I love this great hoppy beer."
"Pours an amber golden clear colored body, with a slightly fizzy, white color medium-sized head, but is diminishing. Has a very hoppy aroma, acidic and some bitterness. Very hoppy taste, an almost acidic flavor. A dry bitter aftertaste."
"Notes from 7/1/05"
"D - I liked this one its a good tasting DIPA that goes down smoothly worth trying sometime"
"Good beer I would love to drink again."
"M/D: I was expecting the beer to be a little more intense given the ABV, but the beer is smooth and very easy to drink. Good carbonation with a medium body to it. As for drinkability, since discovering this beer maybe a month ago, it has been a constant in my fridge. The beer is really well done and not overpowering like a lot of DIPAs. I strongly recommend to any hop head."
"I think it has potential but maybe my bottle was bad?"
"Pours clear orange-gold with a minimal white head. Biscuits, oranges, grapefruit, and caramel in the nose. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Sweet grapefruit hops up front that move into a resiny bitterness. A caramel/candy sugar-like sweetness follows, which gets somewhat unpleasant towards the end. Seems to emmulate Lagunitas' Maximus in the sweetness. I wanted more hop bite, but this was still good."
"Nikki"
"Expensive at $12 a sixer, but worth a pickup for hopheads."
"Drinkability: dangerously high. At 9.2 ABV this beer could really sneak up on you. Yet another reason to come back to Denver."
"Overall, quite easy to drink for the style, and thus dangerous to session (would that I had the opportunity to even try) and ever so tasty to this recently avowed hophead. Given Alberta's newly industrious import activity, I wouldn't be surprised to see this here in the near future."
"hop bite in the back. a little carbonation fills the edge of the mouth. not overpowering for a double IPA, the alcohol is hidden, a little earthy in the back of the mouth. nice soft taste on the mouth, buttery."
"Whow what a great hoppy beer.I love this I could drink this all day. Beautiful gold color nice white head. Wonderful citrus floral nose.And what a perfect balance between hop and malt.MUST TRY!!I wish I had picked up more of this beer.Really a great beer for hopheads."
"Whoa! Now that's a bitter beer, if you're man or woman enough to take it. This unique brew pours a nice orangish liquor holding aloft a thin but nicely persistent head that laces attractively down the glass. The nose on this bad boy just jumps right out of the glass and grabs you by the olfactory bulb. Very floral and enchanting. The mouth is thick, spreading the grainy malt across the tongue as the bitterness grows slowly but steadily across the palate to the finish. On the morning after (yes, I think it will last that long) this steroidal brew leaves a bitter aftertaste even on the roof of your mouth, where you're not supposed to even have taste buds."
"D: This is one of those beers that isn't exactly like every other IPA, but is still very drinkable. It's unusual, but definitely likable. Packs a wallop for an IPA."
"This is a pretty solid DIPA. Not my favorite but it's worth a try."
"D - This is decent beer but fails to stick out as a great IPA. I would rate this as a session beer really. One or two would be fine."
"Definitely not the best Double IPA I've had, probably more at the lower end of the spectrum. I've got a few more of these. Hopefully the next one will be better."
"M + D: Quite a well-rounded body... slick and quite refreshing, as well. Very pleased with this beer. A sipper with that big ABV, but the alcohol is hidden incredibly well. No real signs of it."
"Drinkability- Breckenridge has done a fine job with this drinkable Imperial IPA."
"Honestly even with the high ABV%, I found this to be a very drinkable beer. The """hoppiness""" was not so much that it killed my palate. Be careful to have too many, but I though I could have at least one more!!!"
"D: Good god this is good. The guy at Five Points recommend it and I really appreciate it. this beer is great. If you see it, buy it. There is very little to gripe about here. Tasty shit."
"This double IPA stands alittle bit higher on my list, although I don't have a laundry list of IIPA tastings I can highly recommend this one."
"Poured a semi-hazy coppery amber with a small white head. It appears to have low to moderate carbonation. The smell is a great whoosh of floral hops. It's slightly bitter (in the lovely-hoppy way and medium-bodied in the mouth. The finish is WOW! There's the hops of course, but a much milder flavor lingers behind--perhaps still the hops but it seems unique. Definitely a delicious IPA and one I would recommend and have again!"
"This is great looking beer that pours a wonderful ambler color with almost two full fingers of white head in my pils glass. Her nose is sharp, dry, sweet and flowery - actually smells like fresh hops - lots of nose things going on. Flavor is good but a slight watery feel throws the flavor off a bit. Hop flavors are about right, and are complex just like the aroma. Overall this is a good to great brew that I would recommend to you."
"D: For an Imperial IPA, this is incredibly drinkable. One of the better examples that I've had."
"Simply stated, I love this beer. From beginning to end it drinks remarkably smooth. It has great color, carbonation, and taste. I cannot drink enough of this stuff on the patio in the evening here in the midwest summer. What makes this a nice drinking (90 min-like) IPA is the wonderfull character and not the typically overly bitter 90 minute IPA's."
"Juicy, flavorful hop flavor but a few notches short of the """withering""" often applied to the style. An oily, buttery texture helps carry the piney, peppery hops. Alcohol makes a cameo in the finish but overall, this is drinkable and quite tasty. I will definitely look for this again."
"This little beauty pours a light amber color, clear, with a fair off-white fuzz and very full lacing. The aroma is a light grapefruit with some herbal malt touches. The taste is a full bodied sweet herbal hops with lots of alcohol presence. Very creamy with a very heavy hop finish, bitter enough to possibly choke some drinkers."
"From a 12 oz. bottle, pours a nice dark golden color with some have levitating in the beer with a nicely retained off white head consisting of varying size bubbles. The aroma consists of light pine needles, some honey sweetness and a touch of citrus (orange). The aroma isn't strong but it is pleasant. A taste reveals a big blunt mouth feel dominated by a heavy dose of bitter hops. Hints of pine needles and orange citrus come through with some residual sweetness from the heavy malt. For the most part this hop monster is balanced but the finish leaves a burning bitter alcohol sensation."
"Taste is in a word...wow. Thick and heavy on the palate with an excellent mouthfeel.Very well balanced with the thick sweet bready malts mixing well and pushing the hops and my palate into submission. I know the alchohol is there and big, but it is well hidden."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and very creamy. The alcohol is a little too strong to make this highly drinkable, but still a darn good DIPA."
"Breckenridge 471 IPA (Small Batch) pours an orangeish copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is hops with a strong grapefruit component. They also nailed the grapefruit hop thing in the flavor. The alcohol is well hidden but I could feel the effects. One of the smoothest of the genre that I have tasted."
"EDIT: After the end of the six pack I find the hop character not growing on me and just kind of a beer that I don't enjoy."
"I'm glad i did because it is really enjoyable."
"The aroma on this beer is just outstanding...I just wish that the alcohol was a little more masked. One and done for me, but don't get me wrong, this is still one enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: A solid DIPA if nothing groundbreaking. Alcohol is about average for the style - that is, pretty high - but there are lots of good flavors and aromas goin' on. Recommended."
"I was surprised with this guy. A sneaky fastball on the inside corner."
"Overall- A good sweet DIPA that might lack some boldness but is easily drinkable."
"D: If you like hops, chances are you will like this one. It's strong on hops, no doubt, but there is some room for refinement. There is a bit of an oily texture at the swallow - not sure if this is from the alcohol or the incredible hops. I guess I might just be tainted by some others but I really like the more balanced IPAs that still pull off the hoppy profile. Regardless, this is a good brew and I would definitely seek it out again."
"Tasted on 6/20/08."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are definitely several better 2IPA's out there."
"This is not a double IPA, it's a good, big IPA. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Very sippable beer. An enjoyable ipa but very heavy for the style."
"Drinkability - This tastes a whole hell of a lot like a one year old bigfoot. Very thick and heavy which makes it more barleywine-esque than Double or imperial ipa. Definitely a sipper."
"Medium-full bodied; a little syrupy, yet crisp. Warming in the tummy with a nice clean finish. Excellent drinkability."
"A pretty good DIPA, stong and bitter, but drinkable for the strength, which stays pretty well hidden."
"Tom"
"Drinkability: A solid brew that won't get any more attention without more complexity. Well appreciated and easy to drink. Well worth it."
"Drinkability: On the lighter end of the DIPA style, but a good beer. The 9% ABV could make you hold back, but the lightness of the beer is deceptive. Decent brew."
"D: Very drinkable. No real hint of the abv. I just expect an IPA to be hoppy."
"This isn't the biggest DIPA, but it's got a very nice mix of hops flavors and is dangerously drinkable. Worth a try if you dig hops."
"D- Very drinkable. Would be a great session beer except for the 9.2"
"D - Very high, the abv isn't noticeable in the taste and it goes down smooth. Pretty impressive brew, and one I wouldn't have a problem revisiting."
"Excellent session beer and the alcohol isn't noticeable. You get more of a hop sensation than an alcohol taste. Great beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Amber in color, thinnish head. Surprisingly just a hint of hops on the nose, with rich malt the dominant aroma. Flavor matches, with an initial honey-tinged malty sweetness prevailing, before the hops finally make their presence known with a nice, bitter finish. Flavors seem more like a barleywine than an IPA to me. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy but doesn't feel 9.2 heavy. Enjoyable brew, but it's probably not something I'd want to drink in large doses, even if the alcohol content allowed for it."
"This turned out to be a better brew than I was expecting. Not something I'd drink on a regular basis but still one of the more enjoyable beers of this type that I've had in a while."
"IMHO, the only thing that makes it a """double IPA""" is the alcohol content. As an IPA it would probably receive slightly better marks."
"I was surprised with this guy. A sneaky fastball on the inside corner."
"Wowza, great IIPA that apparently is a fresh and lively example."
"Breckenridge has knocked this out of the park. 471 is a great, simple double IPA that somehow manages to be a session beer. This is better beer than Hopslam. No, really. Don't believe me? Get some for yourself. Mike can hook ya up."
"Drinkability: This beer is much more drinkable than most IPA's and IIPA's. A good transition beer I believe to those non-hopheads out there. I would buy it again if the price wasn't so high. Please farmers, grow some more hops!!!"
"Drinkability is pretty good. It's a tasty DIPA, but it's a bit unbalanced, I will enjoy this bottle, but I don't think I'd drink more than one in a session."
"Not a bad beer, but I will not purchase again. Too many better examples out there."
"Drinkability is moderate considering the style (high abv and bitterness). I don't know if i would go back to this one, but it is good, and worth the $2 i paid for it."
"a rather unexceptional brew, unfortunately. i had a bottle last week and was blown away, so i wonder if this second bottle is a dud. i may edit the review later if this bottle was an aberration."
"Drinkability: very easy to quaff this bomber and probably another one if I had it. Nice flavorful beer here."
"Full body with good amount of carbonation to contast the hop oils. A great English style double IPA."
"D: Pretty solid dIPA... not as big and bitter as some others... makes it a good choice for with a meal."
"Drinkability - Definately drinkable. Takes some time to judge after drinking."
"This beer is well constructed, but I was hoping for more hop character, or any character. There are plenty of beers I'd rather buy for the price."
"It's a great tasting DIPA. While I love GD's Hercules, that's such a big beer there's almost nowhere to go afterwards, whereas this feels a bit lighter while still being very satisfying. This would be a great one to enjoy on a summer night...or any night, really."
"D- This beer has a good drinkability, very tasty. A beer that could be enjoyed back to back."
"Drinkability: I think I echo what a lot of folks have said: Breckenridge brews this beer? But I think it goes for a lot of breweries these days, which is brew better and make less. Most of us will pay the money for it, it's more complex, and there's much more to offer. It's a pretty expensive 6-pack, but again, worth it, and pretty damn good comparably with many of the DIPAs out there. And there are always the bombers if you can find them, if you don't want to commit. I have one that's been cellaring -- when I actually believed that DIPAs get better with age -- that I'm now not extremely anxious to try, and I'll review it when I do. And by the way, how the hell is this 9.2% ABV?"
"Rich gorgeous shade of amber, with a light off white head. Smell is big and grapefruity right off the bat. Like grapefruit syrup. Citrusy, honey tones and some grainy malt. Taste is pungent, hoppy, bitter, but well within a nice drinkable limit for a double IPA. More fruity bitterness than astringency which is nice. A quick clean finished, and balances even more and sweetens up a bit as it warms. A very nice double IPA, and one of my favorites for the price."
"It has a bitter after taste that I cant really shake. But I'll finish off the whole bottle don't get me wrong."
"Slighty thick and very smooth. Also a bit of sweetness. Very drinkable Would surely drink again. ABV well hidden."
"D-Highly drinkable, though I couldn't pound these-but then, pounding is for wankers. Definitely liked it."
"D: Despite the high abv and the generous amount of hops, it's balanced enough that drinkability isn't hindered."
"Btw, I was served this pint in a frosted glass,(I'll correct that next time I'm here) and as the beer warmed, all the flavours intensified and I enjoyed it even more. I think this is a very solid, very balanced, very easy drinking DIPA and I'm going to revisit the draught version, just $4.25 a pint, soon.(Botttles are still not in town)"
"The beer poured with easy, no sediment in the bottom of the bottle. The color was a copper red with a slight haze. The head shortly dissipated after being poured but a good amount of """bubbling""" remained, with a moderate amount of lacing. The aroma was hoppy, but not overpowering. The taste was mildly bitter and a bit on the sweet side. It's definitely a good IPA to start with, and I will be recommending it in the future. I also dig the """small batch""" sales pitch...never a bad idea to use creative marketing."
"Very creamy,very light feel for the style. Dangerously drinkable for a beer over 9 percent. Not what you would expect for a double ipa,but really enjoyable and if i had to drink a double ipa all night this would be my choice."
"D - Drinkability is good. My limit would have to be one given the 9.2% abv."
"Seek out to buy this beer."
"Definitely a great brew, hopefully be able to find a few more from Breckenridge by the case in the future."
"D: A nice birthday gift indeed. Thanks Jer."
"d: Hop flavor doesn't blow you away, but the balance is very good. Alcohol is hidden pretty well. A solid IPA with good drinkability."
"-drinkability, no problems unless driving."
"D: For all the super-hyped DIPAs out there, this 471 gets no credit amongst the """big boys," but easily stands among them. And 9.2% ABV? Come on, it can't be! This beer is dangerous."
"Pours a cloudy, orangish/brown in color. No head forms on the pour. Smell is hops, but there is a good amount of spice there as well. Can't quite put a finger on what spice it is, but it's definitely there. Taste is bittering hops. There is quite a lot of malts to support these hops. Some very floral tastes come through as well. A little thin on the mouthfeel."
"Overall- Not very impressed. This is one of my favorite styles so I thought I would love this brew from a well respected brewer, but it just didn't do it for me this time."
"What a great beer. Not particularly my flavor because I am not an IPA fan but I am always first one to step up to something I haven't tried and this did not disappoint. It was incredibly smooth and rich in taste with the hoppiness for even the most amateur beer drinker to enjoy."
"D: Pretty good."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a tan head. In the aroma, big piney hops. In the taste, again, big piney hops, sweet to start to a dry end. A smooth, small bitter in the mouthfeel and a semi dry, hoppy aftertaste. Hides the alcohol very well, quite smooth and tasty."
"D-Easy drinking beer,nice treat for a hophead,wasn't the bomb I thought it would be,but I could enjoy a couple of bombers now and then."
"An unusual beer. Pours a clear amber with a medium sized white head. Decent lacing on the glass. Smell nothing outstanding. Very nice taste. Floral hops just barely beaten out by caramel malt. Fairly nicely balanced and very smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, but not the hops bomb I would expect from a Double IPA. I had no idea of the abv until I finished the 12 oz bottle. There was no hint of alcohol. If someone was serving this in pitchers, I would be in deep trouble before I figured out it was 9.2 percent abv. This is a very pleasant beer tasting experience."
"D: Quite drinkable considering the abv. This one was a surprise. I wasn't expecting much but was quite happy with how this one turned out."
"Pours thick and with no head. That still freaks me out man. No head? Nose is strong hops. Piney syrupy hops. Pretty pungent, but not real overwhelming or overdone. Odd flavor profile here. I get that typical mass hopped thing going on, but I also get some apple flavors going on. Really odd carbonation thing going on. This just doesn't seem right or balanced to me. This seems like it has champagne attributes, but I don't think it is intentional. Overall I have to say this was not as good as I hoped it would be. Weird balance, or lack thereof just makes this an almost jumbled mess of potential. A miss in my book."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was an orangish amber color with light carbonation and slight lacing. The aroma was citrus hops (grapefruity) and sweet malt. The grapefruit, not a fan, took it down a notch. The taste was good with a clean start leading up to a good but not overpowering hop bite. It's 9.2ABV but you can't taste it which is a pleasant surprise. If not for the ABV, it's almost a session IPA. Overall, another good outing from Breckenridge and definitely worth trying. (Occasional)"
"Overall, I feel this beer is lacking the balance of ingredients that the top notch examples of the style achieve. Although the style is designed to feature the hops and higher alcohol content, in my opinion, this beer doesn't do enough to mask the harshness of that higher alcohol. That being said, I am happy to see this or any brewery attempt this style, and I am glad that I gave it a try. But considering the alternatives, I doubt that I will buy this one again."
"D - pretty good I'd say; this is from a pint bottle and I really enjoyed the whole thing despite having had a large (and delicious) Mexican dinner before cracking into it. Would drink again and would recommend others try this one if you get the chance."
"12 oz bottle. Pours cloudy copper with a 1 cm off white head, mostly diminishing. Aroma is sweet, floral hops. Initial flavor is sweet malts, then bitter hops and citrus. Bitter aftertaste is lasting. Moderate carbonation, medium body, moderate lacing, alcohol noted as it warms. I really enjoy this DIPA and will continue to buy it in the future."
"Found a bottle of this in the bargain bin at my local store. I'm glad I made the effort. Dark yellow, very little head. Smells of grapefruit, a bit of orange, and tastes of moderately bitter citrus, with hints of grapefruit and orange in there. Moderate carbonation with a bitter aspirin aftertaste. Thoroughly enjoyable, I could drink many of these."
"Drinkability- This is a DIPA? 9.2%??? Had me fooled big time. I was looking at 7%...maybe. I guess this makes this the ultimate session DIPA. Super easy to drink, great flavors and nose. All around quality beer."
"Body is nice and chewy, very creamy and full. Slick and slippery on the tongue with surprising drinkability. No trace of it's strength until you finish your fourth one! A solid IIPA that is worth seeking out."
"single bottle taken from the old man's fridge"
"The bottom line: If you run into this small batch effort I definitely recommend giving it a whirl...it is a nice interpretation of the DIPA style at an affordable price. I dig it."
"Well done, this is easily worth the grab."
"DIPA ? A good brew nonetheless, but as far as a DIPA,eh. Definitely worth a try if you like this style ( which i do ) . Classic ipa qualities to this one and the only place it comes up short is umph! As I read this it's sounds like i'm knocking this down but i'm not, i really liked this ,just didn't love it- try it yourself."
"Opinion... I am very pleased with finding the last case of this brew at a local beer distributor in Pennsylvania. If you like double IPAs, this is well worth searching for,... cheers."
"This isn't the nost beautiful beer to look at in the glass, with its haze and wimpy head. But it more than makes up for it in the taste department. Easily among the best IIPAs I've ever had. Seek it out."
"The taste bursts onto the palate with grapes, lemony citrus, sweet malts, and some alcohol esthers. Batch 471 borders on being a bit TOO sweet, but it's balanced nicely by a good bitterness that stings the sides of the mouth. With a big, viscous body and a good carbonation level, this beer leaves a lingering, bitter finish that's also sweet & fruity. This is definately a beer I'll be having again. I can't say it'll ever rank up there with my top DIPA's, but it's a solid brew nevertheless."
"D - While the bitterness and complexity of this beer make me return for sip after sip, for me it lacks some of the depth that some beers have that leave me with a more satisfaction. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"D- i'd prefer tamer alcohol, other than that this a great 2IPA, not the best by any means, but this should be on every hop heads wanted list"
"D: For a beer that's almost 10%, this is a very tasty beer, and easily one you could enjoy a few of, were it not for the high ABV. Hell, even with the high ABV, you could still enjoy a few of 'em."
"D - When it's all said and done, this is a very drinkable near 10% brew. Any possable faulta are minimal at most, and this beer will go over well with any hophead."
"Overall I had great expectations for this beer that really didn't come through. Although I enjoyed it, I needed more from this IIPA. I would try it again, but the high ABV did not come through with high taste. Shame, I really wanted to love this beer and I walked away thinking mediocre. For those comparing it to DFH 90, this can't hold a candle to the 90 Minute, but that's my opinion."
"Like a very good homebrew. Doesn't do anything wrong, but doesn't stand out on the good side, either. I would love to visit the brewery and see what else they have, but this is in the middle of the pack for me for the DIPA style."
"The taste is slightly acidic. Of course the hop grapefruit taste dominates. It starts off sweet but finishes dry. A nice departure to most highly hopped beers today. The alcohol is nicely hidden and hardly detectable. But what let this beer down is the poor carbonation. Even fresh out of the bottle it seems slightly flat and unlively. It deserves a lower mouthfeel score but it doesn't ruin the experience of drinking an otherwise great brew."
"The beer pours a clear honey yellow with a modest bright white creamy head that lingers more than most, as it fades away; the lacing provides an occluding curtain upon the glass. Nose has a rich malt sweetness, the hops pine like, hints of lime, clean and fresh to the olfactory sense, start has a decent malt presence; the hops counteract the sweetness with the top medium in its feel. Finish has a brisk acidity, the hops spicy and refreshing, aftertaste taste is dry and pleasant, a nice treat for the palate."
"Overall, semi-recommended. It's fine, just not exceptional."
"Try it, you may really enjoy it!"
"D- It is ok besides the mouthfeel. It really just kills the beer all around."
"pours a hazy orange color with hardly any head, not a whole lot going on in the smell department, some fruity hops but nothing super strong like other ipa's... Taste if very good though, slight tingle from the alcohol at first, but lots of piney and spicy hop flavors, has even a pretty decent malt aftertaste aswell. mouthfeel isn't bad, i like my beers to have more body, drinkability is average, its strong so i can't drink tons of these."
"This one beats DFH 90 Min IPA has my favorite DIPA."
"Pours a dark golden with a thin head. No real lacing. The smell starts with light, honeyed malt; alcohol; a touch of graininess. Where are the hops? Taste is relatively mellow with rounded herbal hops flavors that turn bitter and more citrust on the finish. More honeyed malt in the background. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and the alcohol is well hidden. Fairly drinkable, but not complex enough or enough oomph to justify the higher abv. My first from this brewery, I'll certainly try more."
"Very clear, orange/gold colour with a cap of off-white foam. Good head retention with thick, streaky lacing. Intense hoppy aroma, sweet fruity grapefruit, pine, and citrus rind. Solid bitterness with plenty of sweet malt for balance. Lots of fruity character, grapefruit and pine resin linger in the finish. The hops have a spiciness to them as well and there's a bit of alcohol warmth. Medium/full bodied with crisp carbonation up front that mellows quickly. Not overly complex, but there's a lot of great hop character in there. The alcohol is well hidden too, which makes this one a bit dangerous. Recommended!"
"I was cautious from the first whiff, let alone sip, as so often a high gravity DIPA renders up more buzz than business, but the delivery here is tasty and fun. And the balance is actually estimable, though again, it seems so balanced that perhaps some of the more poignant elements are rounded a bit. But then there's that ABV that is not only cloaked, but so well incorporated that it could very well knock you silly before you realize you've been smacked. And yet, despite it's sneaky way, it tastes good and goes down with a warm glow. So 470, 471, whatever it takes, I'll gladly take more of this small batch."
"Don't drink and review."
"The hops were intense, but I really liked the malty finish to this.Typical characteristics. Deep amber appearance, nice lacing on the glass. Nice, floral aroma of hops, but not overly aggressive. Hops dominate, but there is a nice balance of malts in the finish that reduces bitterness. Mmmmm. The high alcohol content is pretty well masked, but it does pack punch. Probably best to enjoy after a halftime meal during tense 4th Qtr action."
"Very nice beer! The first time I had this beer it was from big brown bomber. Pours wonderful. A nice clear amber with a huge head. It leaves lacing all down the glass (looks like my homebrew). Smell is nice and hoppy but not intrusive. Fantastic flavor. First is the hop pine flavor then enough malt body to balance it out. This beer is very well balanced especially for a double IPA. Although I like a DIPA the high ABV always gets me but not with this beer. In fact I detect no alcohol burn just smooth flavor. I liked this beer so much I went back and bought me a sixer and will take it Germany for Oktoberfest. See what those lager heads think."
"D- I was blown away by this. This is going to be my standby for HopSlam. A truly underrated beer."
"Notes: This might have knocked my socks off a few years ago, but this is my favorite style now, and with DIPAs like DFH 90, Dreadnaught, Ruination and Stoudts available, it just doesnt cut it as DIPA. Really lacking in the malt/body dept."
"Poured a clear amber with a thick, rocky head. Carbonation is well developed and head settles to a clumpy lacing. Smell is slightly catty, reminiscent of Pacific Northwest hops with an underlying and somewhat toasty malt character. Taste is super hoppy with a lingering, resinous bitterness. Malt flavors creep up in the beer's finish. Mouthfeel is crisp with a very dry finish. Drinkability is very good; this beer is sure to please hop lovers."
"Hazy pale amber color with a three finger, dense off white head and great retention. Spicy pine resin up front and a little buttery malt malt softness in the back. Peppery, piney, and husky flavors. Fairly dry, malt sweetness of honey that clings to the palate. Thin, watery mouthfeel but manages some creaminess with a vigorous swill. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming and the finish sustaining with its dry, resinous, peppery, husk notes. Well...pretty straightforward DIPA, there are plenty of better ones out there."
"Hear here Breckenridge Hear here!!!"
"This IPA poured light and frothy- clear light orange in color. Aromas were earthy malts and floral, grassy hops. Malts are big on the first sip until the hops come through- the malt flavor is there in body and thickness, but there is no underlying sweetness or unique character- very flat tasting for a double IPA. The hops were grassy and watered down- their bitterness was unrefined and flat like the malts. Light mouthfeel with abundant cabonation- the only interesting thing about this brew is the well hidden ABV."
"I like hoppy beers and this fits the bill. I wasn't expecting much based on the smell of the beer; just average. But the first taste set me straight. This IPA is hoppy and has a sweet mouthfeel. It's very drinkable even with a higher ABV and the carbonation was perfect. I highly recommend this to any IPA fan."
"D - A real refreshing ale for having 9.2% under its belt. I found this to be a delightfully drinkable beer. Way tasty!"
"Overall This was a really good brew. I really like my double IPA and this did not dissapoint. It really was a solid offering and lived upto what I thought it would. If it was available it would no doubt be a regular in my fridge!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a shaker. This double IPA poured a light amber/orange color with a very faint haze and a big, beige head that quickly faded. Some good, chunky lacing was left behind. The aroma was made up of notes of grapefruit, pine, and a mild caramel malt backbone. The flavor was very grassy and wheaty, with an upfront maltiness, followed by a quick bitter finish. Not exactly the hop bomb I was expecting. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. My overvall imperssion was that this was very drinkable, but with the abundance of good IPAs and double IPAs available, I would pass on this one."
"Large bottle, no freshness insight presented. Pours cloudy orangey caramel amber, underneath a protracted medium tan head, that lasts and lasts, gobs of thick foam and lacing sticks around, nice looking beer. Nose is all about a supreme balancing act, soft caramel malts swirling around leafy hops. Ultra silky smooth for a DIPA, easy on the tongue and taste buds. Hops big and bold but not stinging or overpowering. Super balance and complexity in evidence. Big hops/big layers of caramel malts. Well worth being on the lookout for out and then savoring this finely crafted creation"
"Drinkability: Not a bad DIPA at all, except for the medicinal finish"
"Drinkability: A very good ADIPA... RECOMMENDED."
"Drink ability is very good and I will come back to this again."
"Dark golden color. OK sized rocky white head that leaves nice lacing but it dissapears pretty quickly. Smell is a wild mix of hops smells (pine, citrus, grassy, resinous). Also a strong caramel malt note comes across. Taste follows suit, with the hops flavors mixing and just when they seam like they will be overpowering, the malt comes to the front with a blast of sweetness. Heavy and a little syrupy on the mouthfeel. This one is good, but it just dosn't quite close the deal for me and move in to the great category. Certainly worth a try and a very interesting IPA to say the least."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head, some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, some malts, piney, citrusy, and some caramel. The taste is on the hop side, a little undertone of malts, nice dose of citrus/pines. Nice little bitter finish. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first Breckenridge brew, and it is tasty. Recommended."
"Would definatly drink again."
"A fairly good IPA, but maybe not enough depth and overall balance to it."
"Well carbonated. The light carbonation heightens the flavors of the citrus. Smooth yet light and refreshing. I would like to have had some more hops, especially in a double IPA. I would have a hard time identifying this brew as a double IPA. A pleasant and tasty beer but when comparing it to others of the style, it is certainly lacking those characteristic big bold mouthwatering hops. Good but, it could be better."
"Damn find IPA: thick and crazy and most importantly very tasty. The best that Breckenridge has to offer!"
"First of all, I think my review wont be as accurate as it should be. This beer sat in my car a little to long, IMO, in the Texas heat. While people have claimed that the heat shouldnt have affected it, I beg to differ. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a snifter. The beer pours a medium orange, forming no head or lacing, and barely any carbonation (I think this is what the heat did to it.) The aroma is intensely strong hops, in a very good way. The taste is strong hops, citrus, and maybe a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and clean. A highly drinkable double IPA. Overall, aside from the fact that the appearance was weak, this was a good beer. It didnt have the harsh swallow that alot of hoppy beers have. The flavor was good and full. I enjoyed it. I will have to try it again though without it sitting out in the heat."
"Too easy to drink at 9.2%"
"Pours a slightly hazed golden copper, huge thick white head forms, nice lacing, great retention. Smell is caramel, perfumy, lots of floral, citrus, some strawberry, slightly grassy, quite nice. Taste is very fruity, grapefruit, caramel, some vanilla, bready, clean bitterness in the finish, good balance. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down. Pretty solid DIPA, nothing crazy hoppy but nicely balanced, thanks Alexa!"
"The best beer I ever found at an airport bar (not that that's a big hurdle). (The airport was Denver, of course.) A beautiful orange-gold color, with a nice, creamy head. Aroma of banana peppers and grapefruit. When you drink it, the hoppiness comes in surprisingly late -- the initial impression is a solid maltiness. But then the nice, fresh-tasting grapefruity hops come washing in, and it finishes with more of the grapefruit and banana pepper. Not a great IPA by any means, but above average, and it made my flgiht delay well worth it."
"If you're in the mood for these kinds of hops then you'll probably enjoy this beer."
"Would be my first pick at the brewery, but is little pricey on the shelf here in Missouri."
"Pretty good but not great. Hell of a lot better than the other beer I tried from them before this."
"This beer pours a dark gold color with a slight head. There is very little smell even when swirled, but there are feint notes of bitter flower. The initial taste is a little off putting because its so strong, but as a few sips go down it because surprisingly easy to drink. The taste is similar to other strong IPA's, with a diverse mix of hops and a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. There is little to no alcohol taste, pretty impressive for a 9.2%'er. The mouthfeel is pretty benign, but the aftertaste is both sweet and bitter, but leaves you lingering for more."
"Just to note... I can't get tired of this. On tap, 22oz bomber or 12oz bottle it is outstanding. The intoxicating aroma that is only matched by it's taste make this one #1."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. It was the first bomber-style brew I've had from Breck, and it's the best I've had from them so far."
"The taste is quite malty at the start with some peach, strawberry, flowers and apricot in the middle, and then a hop overload. It's slightly unbalanced, but still enjoyable."
"Best thing about this beer was its looks. On the plus side the alcohol was very well hidden. On the minus side diacetyl and not enough hops. If you enjoy diacetyl and brews that arent hopped over the top it may be worth trying, if not i strongly suggest avoiding this ale until its reconfigured."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light to medium bodied and very well carbonated. At 9.2%, it's a little strong to session, but it's very drinkable. Overall, very good IPA. Certainly recommended."
"Overall- Really good beer. I can't give this enough props. I can't give it a five because there are no fives (right?). But it's close."
"I had this on tap at one of the Breckenridge Brewpubs. It pours a nice amber color and I could smell the grapefruit aroma as soon as it got close. The flavor is just like the aroma with a bunch of grapefruit and a good malt backbone. It is surprisingly balanced for being double hopped. The body is nice and full and this beer has great drinkability. I was surprised when I went to rate this beer at the level of alcohol. When I was drinking it I would have guessed around 6%...quite a bit less than the 9.2% that it clocks in at."
"The only offensive thing about this brew is the smell. Smells of engine oil. If you get past that, this is one terrific brew. Extemely well rounded. Hops are nice but do not dominate the flavor. Alcohol almost undetectable, making it a deceptive beer which should be sessionable until you drink one or two and your head hits the floor. The hops, although present, quickly dissapate and yearn for another sip. A really great brew which although seems to be harmless, but straight whiskey may wreck you less."
"This is a very well rounded beer. It reminded me of a home brew recipe I once tried called (John 1981). One of my top recommendations since it has the perfect balance of hops (flavor and smell) with the other smooth flavors. Perfect beer for BBQ and pizza."
"This beer poured a somewhat cloudy amber orange. The aroma was indicative of a twice hopped (or dry hopped) beer. The taste is slightly bitter but overall sweet and finishes well. This is a very drinkable beer. This beer reminded me very much of Charlie Papazian's John 1981 from his book Microbrewed Adventures."
"This beer is one easy drinking beer. I could make an easy session out of this one. I highly recommend it."
"Palate is heavily skewed towards the hops & accompanying citrus. Not a lot of malt to round it out. Medium or perhaps fuller bodied than many IPA's - and nicely """chewy""" in a way."
"Overall, a decent beer from a brewery that is so-so in my opinion. Not a bad beer by any means, just not as good as it could be. It's worth trying, but not really worth seeking out. Good deal though...."
"Pours a crisp light amber with a decent off white head that diminished to a small layer. Aroma was dominated by citrus hops with some sweet malts. the taste is a great abundance of citrus hops against a sturdy sweet malt backbone. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol is well hidden. This is an enjoyable IPA, although I would certainly consider it a Double IPA."
"Not bad. Nothing out of this world here, but I enjoyed this beer. It's tasty and balanced, so there's really nothing to complain about. I'm not sure I'd get it again, though, because it was pretty expensive. Recommended."
"Please Sir, may I have some more?"
"Pours out a marmalade with nice cascading carbonation and a fluffy and rocky head that leaves sheets of lacing with big holes in it. Lots of earthy, herbal, and grassy hops in the nose with a pleasant absence of pine needles and grapefruit. Malts stand on their own well while still allowing the hops to have a sturdy presence in the nose. I get a good deal of toast, caramel, and bread. I thought I might've been crazy at first picking up some buttery notes, but, sure enough, this is made with an English yeast strain. Fruity esters, caramel, toasted malts, stone fruits, grass, and earthy, herbal hops all play very well together. Not too sweet and, with only 70 IBUS, this doesn't try to strip your tongue off. I can't even taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel is surprisingly not too thick with the high abv, and manages a smoothness all the way through. Very drinkable, but I have to put on the brakes because of the alcohol."
"D: Overall, this is a classic Imperial IPA with good balance, weight and length."
"Score edited 9-6-08."
"I poured this 12oz bottle straight into a snifter instead of a pint glass. The color was a very light orange and transparent. There was a healthy stark white head that was about 3 cm and then subsided. The smell was a littel """catty""" like some ammonia with hints of apples. The taste was certainly hoppy but no citrus and more cattiness. I also tasted sour apple a little. The aftertaste was pretty bitter. Very solid DIPA."
"The drinkability is good. I usually like more taste in my double IPAs. I'd like to see things pumped up in this beer and made more extreme."
"Nothing is BAD about this beer...I've just had better. If I didn't have help I'd have no trouble finishing the bomber, but I doubt I'd want to continue. I've got another bottle - maybe I'll see if it shields me from the super spicy chili I made."
"based on the high rating of this beer, i was a bit underwhelmed, but there's no debating that it is a quality beverage that all should enjoy."
"The bomber poured a hazy copper orange. Thin head left a thick and chunky lace down my glass. Smell has hops and piney citrus, could be more intense. Taste starts a bit malty and finishes with a dry hoppy tang. Very clean dry finish, and the alcohol is hidden extremely well. I found this to be an extremely drinkable DIPA. I will be making the trek for more bombers soon."
"D- a really good IPA, should be classified as a double at 9.2% ABV, enjoyed this one alot, thinkin about gettin my growler filled of this stuff"
"I thought I was grabbing a regular IPA, it was dark, I find out later it was a double. Hazy orangey with an initial foamy head. Orange citrus aroma and taste. Quite smooth, and decent mouthfeel. Well malted for its true style. Satisfying, with 9.2% well hidden. Good mouthfeel and carbonation."
"~UBS"
"This is a terrific IPA. It definitely packs some punch which I really like. A must try."
"Not bad, but that strange taste is somewhat off-putting. I wouldn't call it bad, and it's definitely drinkable, but a bit strange. I hope to be able to better characterize the unique taste eventually."
"This is pretty good for a 9.2%er. Dogfish Head 90 minute is the way to go if you want a high gravity IPA. This one is worth the try though!"
"Overall: Bitterness is great and a hallmark of the style, but what I really look for in DIPAs is hop flavor and aroma. This beer has a very good aroma, but the flavor is pretty lacking as far as hops go. Still a decent IIPA."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy orange/copper color. Rocky off white head, which holds together quite well, and leaves some nice patches of lace. Nice grapefruit, citrusy aroma, followed by hints of floral and pine. Some caramel, slightly toasty and biscuit like malt leads off, followed by citrusy and herbal bitterness. Good amount of sweetness balances the perfumey and herbal lingering bitterness. Medium body, with appropriate carbonation. Not my favorite hop combination, as it seems to be too perfumey for me."
"Had a sample at the Strong Beer Festival. Beer was a nice golden color, low head (could have been because of dirty glass.) Aroma was pleasant but not overpowering like the west coast IPA's. I would say it is a notch above Stones IPA. Really a quite drinkable beer. Pretty well balanced but leaning a little more to the hop side. Glad to see another good little microbrewery becoming available in Arizona through Little Guy Distributing."
"High abv is well hidden."
"The beer is not as malty as I have come to expect from a DIPA. I would like a bit more sweetness from the style. A firm bittering backbone in this beer. A bit weak in the way of flavor hops in my opinion. It is a a pretty drinkable beer, if it were the only DIPA available and I was hankering for one I'd buy it agian, but only in an emergency."
"I am quite pleasantly surprised: this is not what I was expecting. Pretty good."
"D - When it says """DOUBLE HOPPED""" on the bottle I expect a hoppier taste than this beer offers. Still pretty good though."
"D-I would have two bombers I gues that is good. High alcohol and high drinkability could get dangerous."
"the flavor is very rich with malt, and very solid of the hops, the flavors of fruit like oranges and peaches, with the beer is resinous, pungent from the hops, the aftertaste of bitterness and a little warming from the alcohol is present. this beer is a little to bitter, it could back off on the bittering hops of add more malt and it would be perfect."
"The best IPA Ive had in a long time."
"Drink-ability high level of alcohol is hidden very well. Only downside is the slight harshness to the hops. Not my first choice for a Double IPA but I will try it again"
"Overall, it's well-balanced and rounded with a beautiful, lightly caramelish maltiness and wide-ranging hop character. The alcohol never appears, and the bitterness isn't over-done. The word """drinkable""" comes to mind, but at 9.2% it'll throw down its own speedbump for you. Very nice! Worth seeeking out!"
"The best part of this beer is in the smell. I geared myself up for some sharp hop bite, but was a little dissapointed. Since it's so clear I'm wondering if there was some flavor loss in a filtering process. Still, it's a tasty beer, with no poor aspects. Don't let the high ABV sneak up on you, as you can hardly taste it. Recommended."
"12-ounce bottle with very tasteful silkscreened design. Crystalline golden-amber peach juice with slightly yellowed white creamy head. Heavily understated nose, with just a hint of caramelly grapefruit pith and a chemical smell bordering on sulfuric. A bit more pronounced flavor, with sugared grapefruit sections leading the way. In the middle there is a brief flash of a crystal malt sweetness, but this disappears quickly under a slightly ferrous mineral quality that weaves in between phases of finishing hop bitterness. Overall, however, this is a very muted taste for an IPA. The consistency of this beer is indeed syrupy, as the 9.2% abv would indicate. Its dextrinous quality is not unpleasant, but for a beer with such girth, I usually expect a severe blast of flavor. This one doesn't deliver, unfortunately. Glad to have tried this, but I'll shed no tears when it's gone."
"The body is full and sticky sweet. Amazing stuff. I would rate it much higher on the drinkability if it weren't so deceivingly light, thus it is very easy to drink too much too quickly. It hurts the next day."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, moderately hoppy, with a semi-dryness on the swallow."
"This is definitely a beer for the hop-heads. Very nice."
"Taste is big and bold, but at the same time very comforting and mellow. The hop bitterness is a little more subdued than I thought it would be, but the balance between the malt and hops is good. Definitely a sweet IPA in comparison to some hop monsters, maybe just a slight bit too sweet for my palate. Mild citrus mixed with lots of caramel. Fruitcake is in evidence as is some comforting bready taste. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, very thick and chewy with that big, big malt presence. The palate dries as the beer slides down the throat. This is a sessionable IPA, alcohol is very well hidden, and the combination of a creamy mouthfeel and the great balancing act it maintains between bitter/sweet is very well done. I'd call this one a beginner IPA though, bitterness is just enough to introduce the uneducated palate to the wonder of hops without overwhelming it with bitterness."
"Aroma-Citrus hops to the max like a Simcoe bomb, piney, fruity. A constant presence that does not let up. Mouthfeel is tart at first with the hops dominating but the sweet pale malt flavor washes in and out, Maris Otter maybe? Then the citrus hops come barreling 'round the corner and hit you again like a grapefruit to the forehead-beautiful. This IPA flat out rules and is a serious delight to my senses. The hops are intense, yet meld with the malt to give just enough body to please. Aroma is still pungent to the last drop. This is hands down one of the best IPA's I've had all year. This and Bear Republic's Racer 5 are at the top of the list. I could quaff this as the alcohol was cleverly hidden and not really detectable on my palate. Excellent brew!"
"Drinkability: Matchless quaffability here, folks. Its almost hard to verbally express that."
"D - Overall this beer presents an interesting challenge. Its by no means bad and is actually really tasty, it just doesn't fit with the normal IPA profile."
"Dark golden, almost amber in colour. Thick, pillowy head left soft lacings along the side of the glass. Aromas were loaded with piney notes. Very nice. Bitterness hits the palate with full force, but in a noncloying way. Solid balance with malty goodness. Good texture with a busy finish. No complaints there. The alcohol is well-hidden here, which makes this is highly drinkable brew."
"This makes me want more stellar IPA's that have a competent brewer."
"O--A really simple IPA that wants to be a DIPA. It has the hops if you are into that, but it lacks the complexity to be a truly great beer. Everynow and again, I need a beer that doesn't challenge your pallate, and this will be a beer I will revisit."
"I skipped this beer the first couple of times I saw it at the store, but decided to try it after a friend recommended it. He was right, this was a really good DIPA, they should make it regularly."
"Toffee orange in color, thin white head forms a ring. Resinous and perfumey hop aroma is quite pungent, a little citrus, and some pale malt. The hoppy taste is balanced well by the sweet pale malt. The flavor was more citrusy and fruity than the nose led on, but is still quite floral and perfumy. The alcohol is noticeable, but not overwhelming, seems more like a double IPA. Overall is was impressed by this beer, but it's not quite an elite IPA."
"Overall I am satisfied with this beer. The more I drank this the more the harshness presented. It was never over the top, but it did take away some from the pleasure. Also it didn't seem to blend particularly well."
"This beer poured a slightly hazy light copper color with a thin white head. Big grapefruit and pine smells on the nose. The taste starts malty then gives way to the hops, piney and citrus. It seems a little more malty than hoppy, but the malt isn't that stong, so it is a bit out of wack. I like the hops but not the malt. It has a medium mouthfeel with low carbonation as it should be. A good beer but there are many other AIPAs that are better."
"thoughts: nice nose, nice flavors, just different enough, really a good beer. I am starting to feel a touch heady from it. The booze is in the nose and the taste, but its just so clean and good that its hard to drink slowly. only con. like everything in life, I would like a little more. I would like a little more malts, a little more body and a little bit more of a fruity floral fresh hop taste. but thats just me being wishy. Cheers"
"Drinks pretty good, but the 9% abv rules this out as a session ale, still a good one if you're jonesing for hops, just probably used the wrong hops varieties IMO"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It isn't too hoppy which is a good thing for me, but the hophead would likely be disappointed. It is so strong with the malt and alcohol that this one walks the fine line between a Barley Wine and an IIPA. If I were trying this beer with a blindfold on, I would probably put it in the American Barley Wine category. Regardless this is a good beer that is pretty well balanced and I would drink it again."
" Probably the best beer I've tried from Breckenridge."
"Still way more drinkable than it has any right to be."
"Medium to full bodied. moderate carbonation present. Smoothness increased as it warmed. Mouthfeel was probably the best thing about this beer. This is not a beverage I will look for in the future."
"Pours a clear amber color with a creamy off white head, which it retains quite well. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit) hop aroma. Taste is citrusy hop flavor, malty sweetness, and lots of bitterness. Medium to full bodied, average carbonation. I'm surprised the alcohol doesn't stand out more with this high of an ABV. This is a solid IPA, its not the best but its pretty good."
"Drinkability: A good beer, inexpensive and easy drinking. The alcohol is well hid. The only comment/complaint I had is I thought I was buying a double IPA, as the bottle seems to indicate by the labeling, but here it is listed as an IPA. My scores therefore, are for an IPA. As a double IPA this would not rate quite as high for me."
"This beer was better than I expected, especially since the reviews are so mixed. It might be that it is much better than the mediocre semi-homebrew beers I've been drinking lately. I think I'd still recommend it even without that caveat."
"A very detectable alcohol burn was noted upon the swallow. Apparently this is around a 9% ABV brew. I then compared it with a bottle of Hopevil pulled from the refrigerator case. Hopdevil is what I mostly measure other IPA's against. (It's because it's so available in southeastern, pa and that's where I live) I founf the bottled Hopdevil to be a superior IPA to this one."
"Of note: I purchased a 6 pack of this to bring back West with me - the draft version was much better and far less grapefruity."
"Creamy mouthfeel. A bit on the thin side though. Some bitterness remains, but hardly any dryness. Smooth and creamy. I would pick this up more often if it was available in my area...nice brew."
"NOTE: I have now followed the initial tasting with some rather spicy Indian food & must say that the pairing is ideal."
"Mouthfeel was light to medium, a little stickiness from the malts that supported the hop bouquet very nicely. It's a crisp but substantial brew that satisfies. I really love the high-octane, citrusy IPAs that come out of Colorado. I will buy again the next chance I get, and savor this stuff. Don't pass up a chance to sample this fine ale."
"Drinkability/notes: A very well made American IPA, which does not succumb to the extreme, as do a fair number of examples of the style."
"Too big and bitter to be sustainably refreshing, even for the style:)"
"Nice orange colored brew with a creamy white colored head that lingers for ever. Smell is a bit floral and of citrus. Initial taste is a malty sweetness followed by bitterness from the hops and a hint of grapefruit. Nice mouthfeel and pretty refreshing on a warm summer day. Pretty solid brew and a good value."
"As this was probably my one and only bomber of this ever, I wsould have to speculate on its drinkability...but I'd guess that to be rather high. I would surely have this again, if possible. Though I dont think it will haunt me (you know who you are)."
"I was very pleasantly surprised with this brew. Great beer, especially for $4/bomber. Definitely distinct in it's aroma and taste from other IPAs I've had."
"Not wholly impressive, even as a budget bomber."
"DI like this one, although not as much as it warmed. Better cold in my opinion."
"What a treat to have enjoyed poolside. This is one damn good DIPA. Pick one up now!"
"Bottom ine: no gold medals await this beer but, to paraphrase the farmer in """Babe, """it'll do, beer. It'll do.""""
"I'd been glossing over this brew at the beer store because I wanted to try some other breweries first, and didn't think much of a $4 bomber. But, hey!, this is a nice IPA. Golden body, a little hazy, topped by a fantastic head. The smell is Centenial hops if I had to guess. Nice and fruity/spicy but with a nice malt base to offset. And the taste is nicely balanced, too. Not overpoweringly bittered, but a nice balance. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Give it a go!"
"Came in a pint glass with a nice white head and a beautiful deep copper/gold color. Excellent lacing, too. The nose is citrusy hops, with a pronounced very sweet lemon/orange smell, and maybe a hint of sour grapefruit. Very nice. The taste is smooth hops up front, mild sugary lemon in the middle, and lingering hops with a bit malt. Amazingly, the alcohol is hidden very well; I couldn't even detect it. Mouthfeel is great, with just the right amount of carbonation and a fine balance between creaminess and dryness. Ends up being dangerously drinkable."
"D: This is a good offering from Colorado, though I wish it had more legs to it. Starts out really good, but leaves you wondering what could have been. I'm glad I got to try it though."
"I'll try this again, a long time from now. Perhaps it will be done fermenting by then..."
"Very drinkable and just as likeable the high abv is well-hidden in the taste but my brain is swimming in it (maybe it is floating?). I want cheese. I want another bomber. I have purchased a few of these in Kansas City, KS (including this bottle); I will get more. I also tried this on-tap at Falling Rock. It is quite good but not earth-shattering. Maybe I am jaded. Whatever, this is a tasty drink. I say it is worth a try."
"22 oz. bomber. Bottle describes it as a double-hopped IPA, and it did deliver. Appearance was a clear amber color, carrying a moderate head, which shrank fairly quickly. The aroma was almost all hops, particularly grapefruit. I thought I also picked up a slight scent of apples, as well. The taste had a faint sweetness and a fairly sturdy malt structure, and then came the hops, again as grapefruit. The beer was medium in body and carbonation, with a somewhat drying aspect. Alcohol warming after the first few sips. I found this a very drinkable beer (if you like hops) and would say that it reminded me of the Smuttynose Big A IPA."
"Like a Bigfoot BW it may benefit from some time in the cellar. Not my favorite DIPA but definately one you should try."
"Overall, an interesting offering in the DIPA category. Some added malt complexity would make this beer a little better."
"D: Surprisingly good, better than I expected. Well balanced, fruity, bitter with warming alcohol."
"D: Very drinkable, and here is the problem. It covers up the fact that it's a 9.2% abv. So if one is not careful it could reach up and grab you hard."
"Pours light amber with a nice thick white head that laces nice and keeps a thin layer throughout the drink. visually an outstanding example of this style. Smell... Hops... this beer reeks of hops. And I mean that in the most flattering of ways. And of course the taste doesn't stray far from the smell. One of the hoppiest beers I have ever tasted. Its carbonated well. The beer is so strong and hoppy you will probably only want one bomber, and you will most likely be sipping it the whole way through. If you love hops and can find this beer I fully recommend picking it up."
"Finishes clean, very easy drinking for me."
"This beer pours a bright copper/orange color with a thin, white head that quickly recedes. Lots of lace on the glass. The aroma is earthy and somewhat citrusy, dominated by the smell of the sweet, caramel and munich malt. The flavor is earthy, sweet, caramel-y... The hop bitterness is ever-present though not as prevalent as I would have liked in a double IPA, especially with the use of Chinook, Centennial and Simcoe hops. Speaking of which, with all of those great hops, where are the flavor hops? Those poor Simcoes are being wasted! :) The mouthfeel is slick and heavy, no surprise here. Drinkability? If you can finish one without a bit of a buzz, you're either an alcoholic or a bit tubby. One is enough for me. Overall, I'm a but underimpressed with this offering. I like Breckenridge, but this """small batch""" might be worth passing up."
"Overall a very good ipa, or double ipa. the taste is quite nice, but just a touch one dimentional (but certainly not bad). Mouthfeel, i think, gives it a great uniqueness. very tasty."
"Pours a crystal clear light amber, dark straw color. Plumes of head form and stick around forever. Aromas are basically hop juice, Cascade and other citrusy,resinous hops. Beer is undercarbonated killing the mouthfeel. It is slightly heavy and syrupy with the hops not making too much of a bite, more for the flavor and aroma. The beer has nothing much else that makes it a stand out and the carbonation issue really is a problem."
"D - The alcohol is hidden very well and I was surprised to see it was 9+%. It goes down very easily and I am guessing this one would sneak up on you."
"from the bottle. poured a a dark honey wiyh a bigfluffy off white head that left a lot of lacing. aroma, I think I smell some hops and some more hops, and the glass is about 2 feet away from me, caramel white pine, flavor, got a big hit of hops and sweet orange juice, some alcohol, a nice bitterness. what a good beer going to get more of this. I do like a good IPA"
"Drinkability- Not sure if I'd want more than one of these in a night. A good quality beer, well built, but not outstanding."
"The 9.2% in this one isn't noticable in the least bit. If it weren't so bitter I could drink a couple bombers of it. Probably not easy drinking for someone new to the world of good beer but I dont find it too hard to drink."
"Pours a reddish-amber with a few fingers of sticky-icky-icky head that lasts miracuously long given the 9.2%. Nose is most unique for a DIPA (which this obvious is, duh), very earthy, smoky, meaty hops (which might make sense given the BBQ in the monicker) with some high octane vapor singeing the nosehairs. Taste follows the unique nose with a very un-piney, un-citrusy, herbal, earthy hop profile, grassy, and smoky with a hearty alcoholic bite letting you know who's boss. This is all hops and booze, yet somehow it works quite nicely. A breath of fresh air in the malt/hop bomb dominated style. And an absolute steal at $2.89/bomber."
"Overall, a good beer, but I've had more impressive IPA/DIPAs. At 9.2%, surprised its not categorized as a DIPA."
"Breckenridge 471 is a 'merely good' DIPA that looks better on paper than it ends up being in execution. My advice to the brewers would be to knock a few percentage points off the ABV and to add an additional few handfuls of hops. Bottom line: I won't be sorry to see an empty bottle like I am with the majority of DIPAs that I drink."
"Taste; plenty of citric and piney hops, and there's an almost grainy earthiness to the bitterness. The malty sweetness is there just enough to keep the bitterness in check. The flavor is stronger, and better, than the aroma led me to believe, but there is a bit of an alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and pretty darn easy to drink."
"This is a clear dark gold beer with a bubbly off-white head. The head did not stick around long, but did lace the glass nicely. There is a nice hoppy aroma, but it's not real strong. The taste is where the hops really appear. It starts out slightly sweet, and ends dry and bitter. There is a strange combination of hops here that gives this a unique flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and thick. The drinkability is as good as a 9.2% beer can be."
"Slightly hazed dark golden. Medium sized ivory white head. Lace left is adequate. Pungent hops on the nose. Real earthy and dirty and muddy. In a a good way. This IPA is down and dirty in a good way. Real earthy and herbal and grundy with the hops. None of that bright Citric or Piney Bullshit (nothing against that), but this has some balls to it. Nice, solid malt backing as well. Toffee and caramel come into play. Body is damn near full. Carbonation appropriate. This is a nice change of pace for an IPA and quite enjoyable."
"Just how I like my DIPA not overly bitter just packed full of hop flavor and with a swift kick in the butt from the high abv. Nice dark copper color with a tight lace head and lots of lacing in the glass. The smell was the weakest thing in this beer, but I have feeling that it is killer fresh the hops just aren't coming on as heavy as I would think. The taste is great full of pine citrus and decently balanced with big malty tones and slight sweetness. Very full and creamy body makes this a good drinker at 9% it might be lights out after a bomber and a long day of work."
"Drinkability: I was initially surprised when this beer was listed as an American IPA, I was sure that it would've been Breckenridge's foray into big ballsy beers, starting with a Double IPA, but sadly it isn't. Not a bad bomber at all, I was just hoping for a little more."
""
"I had this on draught against 90 Minute IPA with Randall the Enamel Animal at BW3 Indy a few days ago and this beer held it's own. Totally different draught and spectacular. Unfortunately I didn't take notes on that one. Would have scored mid fours draught."
"Drinkability was very high, solid level of alcohol but not ever present on the palate, a few pints of this would leave you feeling pretty good."
"And at $6 a bomber I don't think i'll be giving their 'double-brown' a shot, either."
"A bit cloudier than regular IPAs. big head, reddish color. orangy hop smell. Whoa, i dont like the taste too much. way too sour. a lot of alcohol evident too which should not be the case with a regular IPA in my opinion. some nice hops on the finish but overall not too great."
"( P.S: I had no idea the alcohol was so high when I first sampled it...kudos for keeping it hidden, but I have a feeling it'll kick in as I finish the bomber!)"
"Feel is medium bodied and textured with a hoppy leafyness in front, rounds off in the middle, gets clean, then drys out with a slight bitterness. Smooth and balanced. Seemingly more akin to a good Pale Ale then an IPA, but holds its own well enough for a hoppy enjoyment. Perhaps not as complex as others I've had, but is decent enough."
"Tastey. Strange, but tastey. Not sure I'd buy it again, though. Especially at nearly 10% ABV! Whew! If I knew I was lookin' at an alco-bomb, I wouldn't have picked it up."
"This one comes from Cellar's in Roseville. Thanks for the tip, Christian! I will definitely be buying this one again!"
"Watch out ladies, 471 double IPA will put hair on your chest. This is the best of the Breckenridge and one of the best domestic IPAs available. Super hoppy (almost as much as Dogfish 90 min). Will cleans the palet of almost anything. You could eat dog doo and drink this and you'd never know it!"
"D- This beer has big fruity hops balanced by big green bitter hops. The malt is hidden and only the alcohol is left to enhance the flavor. Many American IPAs have lots of aroma and taste hops, which this one does, but not many have this noticeable of a bitter finish. It is a good solid beer but a little one-dimensional. Its good I really like that dimension, hops."
"Grabbed a bottle of this at the Central Market in Fort Worth. (I love Central Market...) Pours a deep coppery red with a bold white head that dissipates after a few minutes but leaves a tenacious lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is very hoppy and floral, with the herbal and grapefruit notes expected of a good IPA. Taste is nice and hoppy, though it just is not bitter enough. I don't _quite_ want to say it's not hoppy enough ... okay, it's not hoppy enough ... but it IS pleasantly hoppy. It's almost as if they tried to tone down the bitterness part of the hoppiness, if that makes sense. Anyway, ripe grapefruit, herbal hints, perhaps a bit of clove. Very nice. Mouthfeel was nice and carbonated, like an IPA should be, IMHO. Phenols coat the tongue nicely. This ale is extraordinarily drinkable - so drinkable that I wish I'd gotten more. There is no hint of the 9.2% ABV. The best offering I've had from Breckenridge, of any style."
"Drinkability: Drinkable - good but not great. Let's hope the next batch is a little more hoppier!"
"wow a very different beer. an interesting lighter color, it really stands out. extremely hoppy, rediculously hoppy. tasted really earthy, like plants. if hops are your thing you will love this. overall not bad, a bit too hoppy for me personally but still a quality drink. its noticably strong though, it packs a punch, cant have more than one or two due to high alcohol and extreme hoppiness."
"A very drinkable brew- the smoothness, flavor, and mouthfeel make the bottle very easy to empty. The taste is a bit biased toward the hoppy side, and I can't say this one is my #1 top pick- but it's a good selection and I'd definitely pick it up again. My IPA options have been lacking lately, and this has been one of the best I've had recently. Wish I'd bought two."
"Drank this after a Moylan's Hopsickel so it took a few sips to gage it after that all out hop attack Hopsickel is,poured a clear copper with some deep orange tint a tight one finger white head settles into a nice creaminess atop.Very floral aromas with some citrus and pine and a touch of caramel letting you know there is some malt in there,a big IPA with big hoppy tones the familiar flavors of pine and grapefruit but there is a bigger sweetness to this big IPA brown sugar flavors really show thru even more so as it warms.A nice IPA has all the hop flavors just sweeter than alot of the style in my opinion."
"Drinkability - potent but tasty. Delicious beer, a high abv, but a special treat now and then."
"Drinkability: If the malt profile was better this would be an easier beer to drink. This is not a bad beer for the money. However I think I will spend a few ducats more and get a better beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creamy aspect and mellow carbonation. Goes down really easily...the bomber will disappear quickly. This one really doesn't seem like it's 9.2%. A winner from Breckenridge. Worth a shot by all means."
"This beer poured a honey brown with a nice soft white head. Smelled of cotton candy and caramel with a smoky sweet dryness. Tasted of big molasses and caramel malts that are superbly blended with some very mild earthy and fruity hops. Finishes dry with a touch of chocolate. Mouth feel was medium with a creamy carbonation."
"Just not enough of a malty backbone to keep it interesting.... a little one dimensional."
"A very drinkable brew for the strength of this beer, this is really in Double IPA territory on the basis of its hops and alcohol content. This is like a civilized Stone Ruination ale. I highly recommend this beer for anyone."
" -Cheers2Beers-"
"Not sure how this is an IPA as it seems more suited to a double but whatever thats not my job, although categorizing beers would be a great job."
"Well crafted, and pleasantly drinkable. Lacking in imagination and excitement. At 9% abv, this should have more hops or malts to offer the serious drinker.A Stone Arrogant Bastard , or IPA, is a better choice for your dollar."
"A nicely put-together beer, straddles the line between an APA and a double IPA. Poured a murkey apricot that gave advance notice of the concentrated flavors. Bold hopping, a touch of grapefruit bitterness, but not citric in nature. A touch sweet but not sticky. Very dense, but not overwhelming and surprisingly drinkable. The alcohol stays submerged throughout. Nicely done."
"Very different on draft."
"Very drinkable. Overall: Worth a try but don't search far and wide."
"Poured from a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz. bottle. Pour is absolutely a thing of beauty. Golden orange with a lot of tiny carbonation bubbles swirling in the glass. A creamy white head forms on top. The smell is great too. A citrusy, floral, sweet smell promising a lot of hops. Hops flavor is distinctive. Very bitter but with a sweet edge to it. Not grapefruits exactly but the front edge of that flavor. Taste doesn't exactly match aroma and appearance but is unique and not just another IPA. I only mark drinkability down because the bitterness would make it hard to drink lots of it."
"Another solid American double I. In comparison to most other double IPA's out there, this one comes in at the middle of the road, but that's good. This one is more citrusy and fruity than most and has the hop levels on par to many great IPA's. The hop flavors are estery, floral, spicy, and a bit harsh (this beer always takes on a 'green' flavor of being too young)."
"Well balanced IPA that hop heads will love. Finshes long an mellows to a hue. The overall juicy feel of the beer is very much like nectar. Very good."
"A great beer, and quite affordable, especially for the quality. I think I paid $2.99. Nice packaging, as well. I wish I'd bought another."
"22 oz bomber. This pours a light copper with a medium white head that clings to the glass. Sweet hoppy aroma. Excellent flavor that has quite a bit of hops in the finish. Very nice mouthfeel. This is a good Imperial IPA (As if there is a bad Imperial IPA!). The only knock on this beer that I saw was the fact that they advertised monster hops, but I have had hoppier brews."
"Overall impression: Well, in my last draft review I complained that Breckenridge should bottle it. For once, someone listened! If this was just a bit thicker it would be a great double IPA. As it is, it's still an enjoyable offering, and one of the best things to come out of Breck."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with orange in there as well. Large creamy tan head looks really nice. Not much lacing. Aroma is citrusy for the most part with some caramel and wheat in there and a bready note. It's mostly citrus though. Taste shows lots of balance with neither the malts being sweet or the hops being hoppy. Just down the middle kind of flavors. Fruity flavors begin then more piney. Yeasty notes smooth it out and add body. Finish is more citrus with a bit of a rich caramel character. Body is on the thick side yet this beer goes down nice and easy. I can't believe the abv is so high. Definitely an easy drinker. Good beer in all but nothing special about it imo."
"Head is nice, big, yellowy-cream, bubbly, fizzly. Thick doily lacing. Color is mostly clear copper. Nose shows ink, flowers, pepper, cheese, beef stew. Pepper, fruit, tobacco hops in front... butter caramel fruit in the middle. More flowers, tobacco and fruit in the alcohol finish. Huge hops. Very bitter aftertaste. It's pretty good. Interesting dark, spicy, fruity, hoppy. The alcohol is a touch harsh."
"Reasonable price of $4 for the 750 ml bottle."
"Taste is enjoyable sweet caramellic malts and that in a strong hoptaste. Rich and full taste. Bitterness not overdone though and build in perfectly to make it a harmonic brew altogether. Mouthfeel is also good and in balance with low carbonisation. Alltogether a feast to drink and please bring me more!"
"Arriving as a gift in a 22 oz. brown bomber, the beer poured out pale golden amber with a generous three finger foamy head. Aroma was typical of an American IPA with pine, grapefruit, and grass notes imparted by the hops, and malt sweetness I was not anticipating. Tasted like it smelled, and Id have been surprised if it didnt. The taste exhibited a harmonious interplay between the grapefruit citric notes and the snappy spicy bitterness of the hop varieties. Sweetness of the malt was there in a sufficient strength the keep the hops from getting too out of hand. Mouthfeel was somewhat gritty and sticky for an IPA, and the aftertaste supplied a lingering dry bitterness. Alcohol seemed a bit too present and warming for an IPA, until I looked up the strength. And I was surprised to see a 9.2% up there. At that strength it is at the upper end of the DIPA scale, and for that style this is quite a subtle alcohol presence. This was, much easier to drink than most DIPAs. Didnt quite match the ease of gulping down of a regular American IPA, but it came too close to be a very dangerous beer."
"22 ounce silk screened bottle. $7 at OUAV in Richmond, VA."
"Light copper orange with a sticky cream colored lasting head. Good clarity. Big resiny """C"" hop aroma with some malt character to back it up. Ouch. Not the flavor I was expecting. Not nearly big enough for style. Everything is blanced well, but I say it needs to be picked up a notch. It does roll over the tounge with a good sensation. Sticky, pleasantly astringent. If this came from a brewpub, it would be very nice. From a production brewery trying a special line, I expect more."
" The mouthfeel is medium in body, with an extended finish of malt and hops. The drinkability is hampered only by the fact that there is too much malt in this beer. No offense to anyone, but if the malt profile was reduced, this beer would remind me of Dreadnaught in all categories."
"471 IPA is a shiny copper color with a large, off-white head. Carbonation and retention are very good. The aroma is full of fresh piney hop smells. Very resinous. A sip starts with awesome piney hop flavors on top of a sweet, complex malt body. The bitterness is ample, but never anywhere near overwhelming. In my opinion all of the flavors here are dead on, the hops are very fresh and have an excellent flavor, while the malt body is almost perfect for an IPA. Plus the layers of flavor lend a great complexity. This is easily one of my favorites of the handfull IPAs I've sampled. Highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy orange rust color with a creamy head that leaves webs of lace on the sides of the glass as it slowly dissipates. The nose contains a good deal of malt sweetness, though the expected piney and floral hops are certainly present as well along with an underlying citrus fruitiness that continues to grow stronger as the beer warms. As for the taste, theres no question that the hops are the key players here. There is a bit of sweet orange and citrus fruitiness along with a good deal of fresh pine and cedar up front followed by raw hop oils and tannins that leave a strong bitterness on the back of the tongue in a lasting sticky aftertaste that remains until the next sip. Very nice. Now, why did I buy only one of these while at the store yesterday!?"
"Sampled in a 22 oz. bomber. My first Breckenridge of any kind. This beer porued a nice amber color with a sizeable white head that quickly dissolves. There is no real visible carbonation/bubble action throughout the glass. Nothing terribly special to behold, but this deceives the drinker about what is to come. Held up to the nose, this beer is fantastic. Hops to the extreme. It is bold and fresh. Almost impossible to remove the glass from my nostrils. Grapefruit and a nice floral, piney aroma help complete a memorable and well balanced smell. 471 tastes sharp, and hopped up. The initial quaff is followed by a distinct citrus bitterness. It reminds me a bit of grapefruit without any sugar. Bold and tasty to me, but could easily offend anyone who prizes smoothness over sharpness. Alcohol is definitely noticeable in the aftertaste. In the mouth the main sensations are fullness and bitterness. Just how I like it. This beer's flavor holds throughout, both during and after its presence on the tongue. Overall one 22 oz. is enough, and perhaps best enjoyed splitting with a friend. Packed with flavor and a high alcohol content, definitely a good sipper. Just relax, take your time and enjoy the D.I.P.A. goodness of the 471. I know I will again."
"BLAM! Big. Beers...RULE!!!"
"The mouthfeel is the """half""" part of 1.5 IPA. Great malt presence, but at certain stitches in time it feels as though it could use a bit more mass. By and large, fine proportion for a 1.5. It wants to be an even number, but it works so well where it is. So surprisingly refreshing. Nice burps of hop gas too!"
"Poured with a nice frothy head with good retention. Colour in the glass was a nice copper orange hue. The higher alcohol can be detected immediately with the first taste, almost a little too strong. Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth finish. Strong hop flavours but without an overpowering bitterness. A very good beer, but I typically wouldn't want to drink more then one during a session."
"The taste is hoppy from the get go; the hops are prickly and biting as the beer slides across my tongue. There are lots of herbal piney notes with a finish that is full of citrus fruit notes. The beer is slightly sticky on the palate with a malty sweetness that accentuates the ample hopping. The finish has a bitterness that lingers though is not all that bracing and there is a note of tangerine peels that lingers as well. Flavors of herbal pine are abbundant in this beer as well as a full suite of citrus fruits. This beer is pretty darn nice right now, I have not had a really hoppy beer for a while and this definitely hits the spot."
"Not bad. On-Tap on Blake Street, at the source. Dark goldeny amber with a nice head of off-white foam. Lacing is good, and retention not bad. Aromas are hoppy with a nice piney/citrusy edge to it. Some malts are in the aroma profile as well. The taste is hoppy up front, but not over the top. The middle is malty and the finish is hoppy yet again. Dry too. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is decent. A good strong IPA, but not too complex in the hopping..."
"Medium body with low carbonation feels creamy on the palate. Taste has elements of honey, lemon rind-mild citrus. Finishes with an alcohol laden sugary sweetness. Sweet malts put in a noble effort against the hop bitterness. This brew has a consistent flavor throughout the drink. Not too bad, but a little too flat for me. Could be more dynamic in it's characteristics. Worth a try but there are plenty other IPA's that are a lot more refreshing than this offering."
"I'm noticing a trend with some DIPA's; huge unbalanced booziness! That said, this beer did have a nice citrus taste that's enjoyable."
"Overall Impression: Not a bad beer, but the alcohol just isnt well hidden and the hops seem a bit grassy. Its scratching the IPA itch I had, but Im only moderately enjoying finishing the bomber, its actually becoming a bit of a chore."
"I'm wowed! Last week I was really dissapointed by a mixed 12 pack from this brewery. After work this evening I stopped at Eagle's Market in Ypsilanti and one of the staff really recomended this one despite our mutual dislike of some of the other Brecky brews. I hope they put this into regular production as it is a really good example of the style, and its more affordable than most DIPAs."
"Mouthfeel is light and thin with a nice acrid sting on the lips and gums. Clean taste, not heavy on the malts like a lot of other double IPAs. (I'm not even sure I would classify this as """Imperial," just a really strong IPA, perhaps a new style altogether.) For a devout maltman like myself, this could convert."
"Oddly the Breckenridge website says this is available exclusively at their pubs."
"The Small Batch 471 was a little thin and bland. Low carbonation. I was unfortunately not very impressed with this IPA. I really am surprised, I thought I was going to like it much more."
"I don't care for most Breckenridge beers. Even the Oatmeal Stout that I used to love has fallen out of favor with me over the last couple of years. But this stuff was good. Not overly complex or balanced, but those are two qualities that don't matter that much to me in a double IPA. I'll have to agree with the statement on the side of the bottle: """Oh lordy, this is fun.""""
"Overall a good IPA with an awesome aroma. Could be better balanced, pick one up if you see it around and like hops..."
"Drinkability is good a better I2PA then I expected after sampling other Breckenridge stuff. There are better examples then this but it is worth a try and a little diffrent then the normal variety."
"Wow, nice cascading head. Forms a two finger light orange-tan head over a cloudy apricot colored liquid. Smells pine-sol citrusy tangerine and oranges. Really fresh and inticing in a way that words just could never describe. The frothy head of foam just hangs around. Tastes bitter and citrusy. Tangerine, lemon, and nectarine. After much thought and searching they also have a piney character and also a pink cotton candy flavor. Just as delicious hop profile with a nice hop bitter to counter. Also a potent rough co-humulone grassy to keep things honest. Malt flavor is quite minimal, a chalky munich malt and maybe some caramel from crystal malt. Fruity esters may be present, but they're either buried beneath or blended into the hop flavors. Now that the beer has warmed, I get a gentle alcohol sting in the nose and alcohol burn late in the taste. The aftertaste is quite floral hoppy with a strong tangerine taste. Md-thick mouthfeel and mildy carbonated. The hops in this beer are unlike any other IPA I've ever had. The flavor is sharp clean and fresh."
"This beer poured from a bomber a deep clear copper color topped with a thick, dense off-white head. The head became fluffy, and left a light lace on the side of the glass. The aroma has nice, light hop floral character with a bit of grapefruit rind and a touch of pine. There is a mild sweetness to the aroma in the form of caramel malt on the finish. The taste has a pleasant sweetness up front, a bit of caramel, maybe some fig followed by citrus, here more orange than grapefruit. The taste was finished with a mild bitterness and a bit more of the hop flower. Nice hop character throughout the flavor. The mouth feel is relatively light and slick. Very drinkable. Nice double IPA with a great drinakbility."
"Crystal clear dark copper color with a thick and foamy off-white head. Thick lacing too. Aroma of hops and pine. Medium-bodied with a dry character. Lots of piney hops and citrus with a good malt backbone. The finish is nicely hopped and citrusy with a lingering sweetness. Pretty good, actually."
"Easily the best beer I've had from Breckenridge, a brewery that previously I thought made ordinary, boring beers. There are bigger and bitterer double IPAs, but only a few are tastier. This is a top shelf effort!"
"Tall of white foamy head over a fairly clear orange body. Some rings of lace and decent head retention. Big citric and floral hop nose. There is a light underlying sweetness as well. A bit of a hop juicy aroma as I have noticed in wet hopped beers was pleasant. Big kick of bitter citric hoppiness over a caramel malt base. Light earthiness as well. Finishes out on a sweet bitter citric note. Medium body and smooth going down. Good drinkability as well. Solid all around DIPA in my opinion. Plenty of hops with enough malt for those who might like balance in their DIPAs. I would pick this up again."
"Umm, that's a bit weird. Starts with hop oil, but a thin veneer of non-descript bitterness. It sticks to the lips. The hop never blossoms though. It's got a good mouthfeel, and the malts explode with carmel yummies on fruit smoothies. The hop portfolio is really shallow here. Waste of time and money compared to the better IIPA'S. This is probably better fresh."
"Very drinkable, very balanced, and a good price in my area for a bomber size bottle."
"Pours an orange color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much lacing no the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus hop as well as a bready character. The flavor has a lot of the citrus hops that is backed by a strong caramel. Very well balanced. Thick mouthfeel for an IPA. Drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: very smooth and nicely balanced, very hoppy but the bitterness doesn't affect the overall drinkability; even better on tap"
"Pours an oranged coppery color with a small head that falls to ring the top. The nose is slightly bready, caramel, with a slightly citrusy and earthy hop. The flavor is better than the nose. A nice caramel base, thick and chewy, with a bright citrusy hop over top. The flavors meld well together. The feel is on the thick end of moderate, with a light carbonation. Overall, I find it to be very drinkable. Its smooth and tasty. No lingering hop, just a nice crisp and clean brew."
"One more huge """thank you""" to absolutesites for the rare chance to try this keeper."
"A pretty good DIPA - tends more towards IPA than DIPA I think. Not best in class, but the best Breck beer I've ever had. I usually like grapefruity notes in IPAs rather than the apricot - personal preference that docked it a little in my book. It reminded me somewhat of Great Divide's Titan IPA , but not quite as good from what I remember."
"The beer pours a nice dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an earthy pale and crystal malt scent with a nice citrus hop aroma. It is bitter with a musty odor. The taste is decent. It has a tame pale and light crystal malt flavor that goes down slow and finishes musty and slightly warm. It is sweet with an earthy, bitter edge. I don't really care for the flavor that much. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is an average double IPA at best. It needs new yeast and better conditioning. Also, the malt bill could use a tuneup."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear orange amber with a nice creamy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass.Typical hoppy citrus and pine aromas, fresh pineapple, grapefruit and caramel flavors. Full bodied with a soft and thick mouthfeel, not syrupy like some of this style, finishes dry and bitter, It is hard to believe this is 9.2%. I will say this is the best I have had from this brewery thus far."
"Medium-full bodied, kind of a juice mouthfeel. Great session beer drinkability to me."
"I am stunned that 471 is a Breckenridge beer. Since when can they brew? I hope they bottle this!"
