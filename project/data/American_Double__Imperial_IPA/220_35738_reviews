"Overall: I think that this is a great beer for any time of the year. I like that it has a higher ABV so that you can unload after a long hard day and at the end of the first beer you are already having a mild buzz. I think that the IBUs are not excessive as they are balanced by a malty body that makes for a very drinkable beer. Drink it nice and cold and be sure to pour it instead of drinking it out of the bottle."
"This is a very well done citrus/pine hop IPA. Pretty standard but very excellent."
""
"A strong piney smell with a sharp bite but smooth finish. If you like """dank""" BIG ales, this is an awesome beer.  Lagunitas is a great brewery and this is one of their finest."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Exceptional IPA, with tons of hops.  One of the best out there."
""
""
""
"I have a sip left I am craving more.  Amazing taste.  Smoother than the typical Double IPA."
"This brewery is quickly becoming one of my favorites..."
""
"Really enjoyed this one. Definitely one of hell of a hopmonster!"
""
""
""
""

"Great beer was flavorful but not too over the to."
""
"From bottle, can't find date. Quality nearly straight hops beer.  Not too much sweetness or florally or citrusy flavor going on.  Very well put together, a little malt mix is just right.  I'd call this a 1.5x, not quite a double, like I do with Southern Tier 2x (my session IPA).  I stress how good this beer smells with every sip.  Lagunitas makes very nice IPA's and this fits in quite nicely. It stimulates the front of the palate and settles in the back of the mouth with strong hops, but so super smooth you will keep grabbing for more.  I repeat a third time, this beer smells awesome!"
"On tap at World of Beers Syracuse. Really not much to say except WOW. This ranks with the best of the best. Perfectly balanced sweet maltiness and citrusy hops."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. An appealing amber-gold color with steady carbonation, with a pinkie-width of dense white foam. Smells of pine, citrus, banana peel, booze. Slams the tongue with a powerful wallop of hop fruitiness and with some malty caramel to balance. A little overwhelming--I never quite find the subtleties other reviewers seem to find. Mouthfeel is a little oily and leaves you smacking your lips from the bitterness. This is a very good double IPA/West Coast hop-bomb."
""
"O (4.25) - I'd had this beer before, but forgot to review it.  But I really like it.  It's a GREAT IPA, and is a pretty good deal too.  I will add this regularly to my rotation."

"Lagunitas never fails good beer"
"Overall this beer had a great price tag and big flavor. A must buy for hop lovers."
""
""
"I just love Hop Stoopid everytime I drink it.  Solid."
""
""
"Hop awesome is more like it!  There is a distinct pear and tangerine aroma.  Same follows into the flavor with a very refreshing, but, dry bitter finish. Yet another excellent brew from Lagunitas."

"Not bad. Definitely hop forward and a decent flavor. Not really fruity or grassy or malty. Kind of a mix. They did a good job hiding the alcohol. Just a slight warming sensation, I'm ok with that."
"Cloudy in a slowly swirly mystical golden pour with thin white top. Fruit and malt aromas aren't my favorite. Wow, though, the flavor is semi-sweet and malty with only a pleasant bitterness of some resin, and a super-clean finish. So balance. Much tasty."
"Great beer! Still seems very hoppy, although I cannot find a date on the bottle. I'm not sure if Lagunitas dates thier beers, but they should.  Atleast date IPA/ hop forward style beers, to ensure the consumer gets them nice and fresh and hoppy!"
""
""
"Good but nothing special. Id take brown Sugga over it any day"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite IPAs, it exactly what I look for; hoppy, strong, a little sweet. Near perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm mad at myself for never drinking this beer before now. It's pretty much one of those perfect DIPAs. The most surprising aspect is the bitterness completely disappears after each sip. As usual Lagunitas shows off west coast style perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O.  A good IPA especially for the price ($3.99 22oz).  For that price it's a steal.  An DIPA with good flavor that is almost sessionable on a hot summer day.  One of the lighter DIPA's i've had and that's the reason I say it's sessionable even for a DIPA.  It's just easy drinking.  No inyour face bitterness.  Not heavy.  Just a nice tasty DIPA."
"Another fine offering from Lagunitas!"
"Pours a dark yellow almost orange with a fizzy head that laces the glass. The smell is full of grapefruit and pine as well as some herby, almost grass scents. The taste was a love note to hops which are very much center stage in this beer. Good amount of flavor throughout, just wish the finish was a little cleaner but a must try for any hop heads."
"Great taste and smell great beer im gona have to k.i.s.s .keep it simple stoopid people mumble beer speaks!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"One of my favorites! Has the hop taste I love."
"Nice, fresh, in your face hops."
""
"Very similar to """enjoy by""" but a much better price."

"Great hoppy flavor, great color, aromatic pleasure. And for only $3.99 a bomber Hop Stoopid will definitely be in the house."

"O: I am a big fan of double IPAs, however I was not a fan of this beer. It is the definition of a """hop bomb""" that doesn't have much balance at all. There is no malt detectable whatsoever, and in my opinion this hurts the beer by making it very unbalanced to the point of being almost undrinkable. At first I thought maybe the beer was spoiled, but the code of 008 5 on the neck of the bottle shows it was bottled on January 8th, 2015 (5 weeks ago). I guess I'm just not a fan of this one. Maybe I'll give it another go sometime down the road, but I probably wouldn't drink this beer again."

"Poured sideways into tulip. Medium head with tremendous resurgence upon agitation. Amber/Orange in color. Aromatics were largely floral and piney with a medium hint of sweet maltiness on ~3rd smell. Tremendous pine and citrus capacity with underlying floral notes. Medium body with a lingering spritz carbonation (especially after agitation). Overall, a fantastic, richly bitter beer that does the job. Cheers!"
""
""
"I drank it a month old and it still retained some aroma. Nice. Still had a big body."
""
"O:  Another winner from the doggie in California.  Not my favorite IPA, but a hophead's delight, for sure."

""
"Can't go wrong with hop stooping one of my all time favorites"
""
""
"What's old is new and what's new is old... definitely bringing this back as a go-to DIPA for me."
""
""
""
"Deliciously hoppy. If you want a lot of hops and nothing else this is for you"
"Drank it after Sea Hag. Different flavor. A little heavier"
""
"Overall: at 5.99 for a bomber of a beer this quality it's a tremendous value. Reminds me of sucks a lot in some ways. Just a delicous solid double ipa"
""
""
""
""
"Ok this is the second time I have come here and bumped this beer up.  This is by far the smoothest DIPA I have ever had.  This is going on my dangerous beer list as I find myself drinking it way too fast"
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this beer.  Great choice for all IPA lovers."
"Another good one from Lagunitas.  Priced very decent so a go to for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer it's always my go to brew for every occasion. Lagunitas seems to know exactly what I'm looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid IPA but not much different than all the other West Coast style IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
"Delicious! Got this 22 oz for $4.99! This is an ale where you'll always want a bomber handy in the fridge. It's a beautiful  sipper."
"Nice beer. Not overly hoppy and still smooth.  Would do again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm I the only one who thinks this smells skunky like a Euro lager? I would have bet money there was a Heineken or Lowenbrau in the glass. Just wondered if this is normal. Taste a lot better than the aroma would suggest. Hops seem pretty muted though. Thinking an old bottle."
""
""
"One two three four five"
""
"very big hop taste as the name suggests. i didnt like the mouthfeel as much, felt very big to me, but the taste itself was nice. good beer, not great, but good."
""
""
""
"Ok, so I am going to probably get slammed for saying this but here goes.  This beer was awful.  Heard all the hype.   I don't know, maybe I got a bad bomber?   The taste was so bad I spilled this out!   Not even in the same league as other American DIPA's.   In my opinion, American DIPA's rank in this order.    1.  Heady Topper (duh).  2.  Lawson's Double Sip of Sunshine.   3.  Russian River Pliny the Elder.   4.  Neshaminy Creek's The Hops of Things to Come.   5.   Ballast Point Sculpin.    Skip this.   If you can get your hands on any of the others I listed, get it.   Cheers!"
""
""
"It's a five (5). You like IPAs? Buy one. Enough said."
""
""
"Overall: After smelling the nose I was awaiting a big juicy citrusy hop bomb but all I got was a minor juicy citrusy hop flavor, some malt and bitterness. Really disappointed in the flavor but then again this could be an old bottle as I don't see any dates on it. I've had IIPAs that have lost their hop flavors and I think this bottle might be old."
""
""
""
""
"It's just ok. Not a big lagunitas guy.. Too sweet"
""
""
"Always been one of my go to IPA's. I'm a fan of the Hop bombs lol"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is as advertised - it has crazy amounts of hop bitterness. It needed the malt balance of a double IPA in order to prevent your mouth from completely closing shut at the astringency of the extreme hop profile. I tend not to rate the 90+ IBU beers quite as highly as Ba's gen pop and this one is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent. I think I prefer Sucks but this is really good."
"Best i'm I've had in a long time. Doesn't have a hard hoppy bite at the end. Excellent  smell and taste."
""
""
""
"O-  really enjoyable.  I'll be drinking this one again in the near future."
"So far my opinion of this beer is a hoppy citrusy dry IPA without much body or complexity.  Definitely would be a go-to beer at an average restaurant or bar, but with all the great IPA's in california I don't think this one stands out to me in particular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very clean and crisp yet hoppy and delightful it really is a great beer."
""

"By far, my favorite beer. Just a downright hoppy taste that just has your mouth drooling of hop juice."

""

""

""
""

"It has a solid hop flavor that you expect from any good IPA."

"Clean aromatic nose, very drinkable.  Feels a little light/thin for a DIPA but that's what makes it so drinkable."

"Stinky. Oily. Dense. Had this beer many times but picked up some really fresh bombers (bottle date 323 day of the year) and was damn near blown away. And they're $6 each! Btw my stoopid burps are all part of the experience. Great brew."

"For the year old sample I had it's probably the best stale hopped beer I've had."
""
"Pours a beautiful golden-yellow color, which is surprisingly clear. The weird thing about this is as you look at the carbonation bubbles through the glass, it seems like they are suspended in jelly. Weird, huh???. Anyway, head is nice, big and fluffy and lacing is ample, clinging and simmering to the inside of the glass. Aroma is heavy on piny hops and some citrus(grapefruit and lemon, maybe. Taste definitely has the IBU's and the pine resin, grapefruit rind and other assorted citrus comes through, maybe not so balanced, but bold and a hop lover's dream. Feels good on the palate, kind of thick, but overall, an IPA that all would love for the boldness. Good stuff, here!!"

"Its  a bit hoppy, but I guess that's why its called Hop Stoopid. Fairly smooth and available year-round. Local favorite here in San Francisco and priced well at most Whole Foods - $4.49"

"We got ourselves a fantastic IPA here. Strong, bittery, hoppy taste. It's what you get with 102 IBUs. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The ABV is hidden very well. This is definitely a palate wrecker with loads of bitterness. Well made and at a great price point."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a dominant hop forward beer that has just enough malt backbone to carry it without it interfering with your hop fix. As  it warms the beer slides to a little more pallet-able but for the most part if you don't like bitter, avoid. However if you like to push the IBU limits (reads 102) this is for you. I have had several beers above this stated measurement that were for sure less bitter. If i'm not mistaken this is made with hop extract instead of cone or pellet so if you think extract is inferior I say give this guy a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - So happy to see Lagunitas in Indiana!  I'd read about this beer, but now it can be had at any of my local bottle shops.  A huge, bright fruit hop attack, it is one to enjoy, but be sure to factor the 102 IBU and 8% ABV in your plans."

"Overall:  For the price range, this is very tough to beat.  There is so much hop flavor that isn't overshadowed by bitterness or a syrupy mouthfeel that few other DIPAs Ive had that can claim.  A damn good beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer has a flavor profile that absolutely reminds me of PtE. I've heard that before, and having now had Hop Stoopid fresh on draught, the same connection came to me. It's less fruity than the hopfather, but has a similar punch of green piney hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This ipa is an excellent demonstration of one of the less understood bits about hops; just because the IBU count is high, doesn't mean it is mouth puckering bitter. Don't get me wrong; this is indeed a bitter brew; but it has more hop flavor and essence than anything else."
""
""
""
""
"For a DIPA, not great. Just not hoppy enough. From the description, I expected a hop gravy, but it was very light and crisp. Good for drinkability, but just not what hop heads want. Is this really 102 IBUs?"

"This is really solid! I cant believe how great the price is for a growler. Only 5.99 for an absolutely wonderfully hoppy ale. I get light notes of citrus, pine and orange peel on the nose with very slight hints of caramelized malts. All leading to a smooth and crisp taste full of flavor. It is sharp with pine and citrus and a light note of orange and wheat finishing out with a dry bite. In my opinion, you get so much more than what you pay for in this one!"

"Julian dating on the 22oz bomber revealed to be from May 20th (so almost 2 months on this by the time I cracked it open and poured it into the tulip glass). Might have wanted it a bit fresher, but that is no news flash. 1 and 1/2 fingers of white head which dissipated quickly and left some nice lacing. Interesting tangerine hue in the light, very tempting. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, and bitterness (yes, bitterness... this IS a 102 IBU brew!). Pine notes on the front wave of the taste profile, along with a citrusy (almost lemony) mid-note, with a big bitter finish. Continual carbonation, refreshing mouthfeel, and a slightly oily presence on the back end. This had a nice balance for a big beer, and though I was v. happy... would have to try one that was super fresh to make this a go-to choice."

"Purchased this in a 22oz bomber. The appearance was nice, but nothing to write home about. It had a decent-sized head and an almost-copper yellow color. Aroma is fantastic. It kind of smells like a tropical-citrusy fruit salad filled with pineapple, orange, and lemon with just a smattering of pine. The taste was a bit different from the aroma. There is more of a malt presence than I anticipated. The taste has more piney hops than the nose would suggest and the citrusy hop flavor is a bit more subdued. It leave a strange, piney (but not unpleasant) bitterness on the tongue. Overall, a pretty solid brew."

"Poured from a bomber, a nice orange in the glass with a sudsy head that lingered. Excellent and attractive lacing. The smell is fresh and of tropical fruit. Can't wait....boom, it hits you with a bouquet of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, and right into a crisp bitter finish 102 IBUs well balanced and offset by the fruitiness. Smooth and drinkable for an 8% offering. Very, very nice. Will enjoy again very soon."

"Great smell. Great color. Nice packaging but a little off with taste. Not terrible be any means but does have the dirty sock taste to it. Almost as if it's an old bottle that has spoiled. Checked for a date but couldn't find one. Smell was much more folksinger the taste. Everything else about the beer is good just. The taste is still not that bad for an IPA but not at all what I was expecting."
""

"A finish of growing bitterness is of citrus pith and soft pine resin while the hops and alcohol warmth dry the palate effortlessly, leaving behind a fleeting malt presence but more importantly a clean smooth bitterness and a tame rosy-spicy bite."

"The hops are not as explosive as I might expect for a Double IPA. But they definitely leave a bitter aftertaste with that toasted caramel malt. Pretty easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Loose one finger white head fades quickly and clings to the glass. Aroma is quite piney with a hint of citrus. Taste has notes of green apple to accompany the powerful hoppiness, mostly pine with some grapefruit and nicely balanced subtle malt characteristics. Light to medium body with just a hint of carbonation to carry the flavors."

"O: I could drink this beer all day long and never grow tired of it. Quite possibly my favorite 'readily available' DIPA on the market. It does everything remarkably well, and even borders on outstanding with the scent and taste."
""
"lots of sweet piney-ness, some citrus and resin, grapefruit rind. kind of mild in the bitterness category compared to many, regardless of the 102 IBU rating, and very nice. also, very nice price point. this brew is WAY better than many others I have paid double and thrice more for."
""
"I'm going to make this short and to the point. This is was a fantastic PA! However, it was much sweeter than most PA I have had. I think it is for the high alcohol content. The color was clearer than most ipa's also. The smell is hoppy and earth like all PA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is similar but more, with an overall citrus-resiny pine character, grapefruit, but lemon and hints of orange as well a nice spicy resin element, and raisiny grain and bread. It has very nicely balanced bitterness and sweetness, so it is not actually bitter despite the clear hop presence, and has a nicely zesty-lively feel."

"What can I say about this? Plenty. Generous price so definitely worth trying even if you are still hesitant. The name isn't deceiving at all once you open it you can smell the aroma of different hops. Poured into a tulip glass and has a great amber hue giving it a great presentation. After my first sip it became one of my favorites; it is bitter, but not overpowering. I prefer this one over their standard IPA. Sure there are other better selections out there, but you will never find such a great beer at this price."
""
""
""
""
"if Hop Stoopid didn't exist, man would have had to create him... or something like that. This beer is a winner, and not as pricey as the other big bottles on the shelf. Bitter was never so sweet. Pair with spicy food of choice and wash those scoville units to hell."
""
""
""
"Great color and decent head. Very enjoyable beer overall. I can't quite put my finger on what it"""s missing but there is something small holding it back from being near the top for me. It's definitely a beer I will recommend and buy in the future though."

"Purchased this while doing my weekend a month at the base I was on. They had a decent selection of beer, and I wound up going with this. I was very pleased with my selection. It poured a nice amber color with a very thick foamy rich white head. What got me though was the smell. This smell is what every IPA should strive for. Floral, fruity sweet and good. I could sit there smelling it all night. The smell didn't translate completely into the taste, but it was still very good. I'd say the lower level of the top tier of IPAs. Felt very smooth in my mouth, very refreshing. I think this IPA is very underrated. I am glad I found it and would not hesitate to drink it again."

"Amber colored with good clarity. Just a faint bit off white foam covers about half of the top of the beer. Intense aroma of grapefruit like hops greets my nose. The body is moderately carbonated and a bit sticky. There is an intense rush of sharp grapefruit hop flavor. There's a decent light malt backbone that briefly appears and is quickly overpowered by a long grapefruit hop burn."

"EDIT: Iv had countless DIPAs since this review and i must say that this doesn't hold a candle to some of my favorites now. I think by the time its shipped to PA that its lost alot of its hop character, and there's no Gregorian date to confirm that. Its mostly a dank onion bomb with some citrus notes. Very good nonetheless"
"Overall, this is quite sweet for a DIPA. The label says 102 IBU but I don't perceive that much bitterness, probably because it's balanced with so much sweetness. One of my favorite DIPAs, especially in this price range."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/19/2014. Pours lightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge mango, papaya, peach, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light honey, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with huge citrus/tropical hop presence with light-moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, papaya, peach, tangerine, passion fruit, pineapple, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, papaya, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt sweetness; with a great crisp hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, and moderately crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA! All around awesome complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""

"Very nice super clear orange-gold with a nice sudsy head. Aroma is dank indeed. Leafy fresh hops, spicy peppery melon, stinky earthy pine, all clean but resinous. Taste is mouthwateringly hoppy, zesty, spicy, syrupy, hop oily, pine needles, resinous with hop crystals. Heavily hopped indeed. The clean malt profile is just enough to provide a nice backdrop for the massive hopping. Good stuff when feeling hoppy."

"Not terrible by any means. Above average actually. But did not live up to the expectations I have of a Lagunitas IPA. I would put this firmly behind both Maximus and Sucks. In all fairness, this bottle is two months old so I will try a fresher one and re-review if necessary. However, the hops don't seem like the issue so I doubt my opinion will change much."

"O- Glad I gave this another shot, I gave it a 3.65 before, it was an older bottle that didn't have the complex citrus and pine that this one has. This really reminds me of a mini-Stone Enjoy By and more available and a bit cheaper, at least for me. Will definitely be buying for of these, at less than 5 dollars for a bomber how can you not. Lagunitas just might be my favorite brewery when it comes to hops, it's between them and Bell's."
""
"102 IBUs? You could have fooled me! This beer is certainly bitter, but very well-balanced, refreshing, and drinkable. The pleasant, fruity sweetness isn't medicinal at all. It reminds me of Stone's Ruination, only with a slightly thinner feel and a tad more sweetness. I can see why it's a Beer of Fame."

"This is my second favorite IPA from Lagunitas. Very fresh tasting, this was bottled just 10 days ago. SUPER FRESH."
""
""
""
"I've been a long fan of lagunitas and this is certainly no exception. Pours a clear golden copper hue with a generous head that quickly lessens down to just a quarter inch of thick frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. The Mouthfeel is smooth and easy. The kind of beer that one could get into trouble with if you know what I mean. The aroma is typical of that of a very hoppy ipa; citrus, pine, and an overwhelming aroma of skunky weed. The flavor is heavy with pine and grapefruit. Very bitter and very astringent...but in a very good way. This is a very enjoyable double ipa for those that like theirs with a ton of hops and bitter notes. This beer is certainly not about balance but neither is hopslam and everyone loves that. And this is a he'll of a lot cheaper and easier to get your hands on."

"Overall: I am a huge fan of Lagunitas. Great brews. This is the first time I was just blow away in a very bad way. I am a big lover of American IPA's and have been for almost two decades. Everything about this ale is fantastic; but this hop bouquet is not pleasant. Wrong aroma hop on this one IMO."

"Oh sweet mother of beer. Came home after a dull, boring day at training for a new job. Decided to walk to the corner store for some honey buns and cheese popcorn when I stumbled upon this beauty. Hadn't tried Lagunitas until this Sunday. I had the Sucks with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Decided to give a Lagunitas brew another try since I was thoroughly impressed. I'm a hop-lover through and through and this baby swept me off my feet and carried me up a flight of crystal stairs into a palace of pure happiness. Needless to say it was delicious. It's hoppy and citrus-y. The mixture of the two dances on your tongue and tingles your senses but not too intensely. It's smooth all the way through- no bite, no bizarre aftertaste, just pure goodness all the way down. The smell is nice although it smells a tinge too nutty for my liking but that's my biggest complaint. It is a fantastic brew and I would definitely recommend it."

"A big brew, this IPA is packed with flavor and it may not go over well with everyone at first, particularly those who are not fans of the IPA style. Hop heads, however, will fall in love immediately and may rank this among the very best. I couldn’t consume this as an everyday brew, but I agree that this is a delicious double IPA that I will certainly buy again."
""
""
"Overall: Tasty and refreshing. On the hop side of balanced, but easy to drink. I would like a bit more malt and mouthfeel, but overall ... pretty outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"Pale gold, bubbly beer with a smallish head. Massive hop aroma: grapefruit, oranges, pine, becomes more floral as the head dissipates. Thick & chewy in the mouth with noticeable carbonation. Lots of fruity hop flavor but it doesn't completely destroy the malt sweetness that hangs out in the background. Finish is sweet, not super-dry, with some bitterness but not nearly as much as you'd expect. Nice DIPA to sip on."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Quite well balanced for such a hop forward brew."

"O: My favorite from Lagunitas. Citrus aroma gives way to a piney dryness that invites another taste. Hops are potent but not overpowering. Extremely drinkable for an 8% ABV. Perhaps the best combination of quality, availability, and affordability of any DIPA."
""
"Overall one of my favorite go to's when its available. Try this now if you havent its just stoopidly good."
""
""
""
"O - I wish this was on tap more as well as 6 packs. This is fantastic and I wish I had more to share. This is a great solid IPA, something enjoyable for everyone."
"Hard to find it much fresher: this was bottled two weeks ago. Pours golden with a little orange. Eggshell white head leaves exceptional lacing. Smells like the freshest piney hops you can imagine, a little citrus but really the aroma here is all about the pine. The taste is incredibly balanced. Hops coat the mouth, but its not overly bitter or sweet. Again the piney hops are what really take the show. Mouthfeel is medium to light and the finish isn't too dry. Ok so I've had this said to me, but I have never had it fresh enough to make a comparison (the day I went to both Russian River and Lagunitas I was a little too overwhelmed) but Hop Stoopid tastes and smells exactly, and I mean EXACTLY like Pliny. Just sayin'. When you have them fresh they are indistinguishable. And of course, both are exceptional."

It is also one if not the best priced DIPAs I've come a crossed (bought this one for a little over 5 bucks after tax). This brewery has to be in my top 10 favorites, year in and year out they put out high quality brews."

"Pours a clear golden color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Lacing is good.  Has a clear piney, grapefruit aroma.  Smells fresh.  Strong grapefruit malty taste with a bitter piney hop.  Aftertaste is very bitter/soapy.  The freshness of the taste is not as strong as the aroma, but it is still somewhat fresh.  It is definitely a beer for hop heads"

"I really like this. A nice amber color and nice white head. A pleasant honey and citrus smell comes to me. At first sip it is rather smooth. You can taste the honey and there is still 102 ibu's to deal with. It is balanced very well. I compare this to hopslam. (I may be right, I may be wrong) I find this to be better balanced in flavor and drink ability. With the alcohol count down from hopslam, there is a definite smoothness that hopslam does not possess. A good beer and a good buy."
"My favorite IPA. Extremely drinkable for an 8% IPA. At $4.99/bomber it is one of the best bargains out there. It pours a golden color with a nice white head. I smell grapefruit, other citrus flavors, slight pine, and floral notes. Also a sweet malt smell is there too. I always take a few seconds to enjoy the smell on this one, it is heavenly. Taste is a huge hop bomb, exactly what I expect from 102 IBUs, but ends with a little malt sweetness to provide balance. Lagunitas is an excellent brewery and this is my favorite beer in their lineup."

"It pours a gorgeous golden color with a fluffy white head. The smell shows off the entire range of hop characteristics: I get grapefruit, other citrus flavors, pine, floral, and herbal notes. Also present is a sweet malt smell. Predictably, Hop Stoopid gives a huge hop bomb on the way down, replete with citrus flavors but also quite earthy, with a malt finish that balances out the taste somewhat. It's as drinkable as the best DIPAs I've had and a stellar example of the style. I've had Heady Topper and this compares well with it, while being cheap and easy to find."

"650 ml bottle with green label and unassuming appearence. The contents are anything but understated however. A dark honey copper color with around five fingers of white head greets the drinker, releasing a classic DIPA aroma of citrus, pine, green leaf/grass, a little pineapple or some other tropical note. Palate is grapefruit and tangerine, mango and starfruit, ample pine and strong menthol, some cattiness. The bitterness is interesting. At first one wonders if there shouldn't be more! What a great showcase for hop flavor ... Then as the iso-alphas accrue, you realize your mouth is getting numb and this thing is getting punishing. Its a woody, floral, and fruity hop bomb.There are culinary herb rosemary type notes and a black pepper spice in the bitter finish. The malts provide some sweet caramel balance but the hops lead the way, as they should. Archetypal DIPA. Although Lagunitas uses extract for bittering I still get vegetal flavors, presumably due to aggressive flavor and dry hop regimes. I am not complaining. Thick heavy body that leaves some sugars but the bitterness remains. Some boozy character but not unpleasant. Track it down."
""
"This smelled really fresh but the malt was strong enough on the tongue to make me think my bottle was a few months old and some of the true hop flavor has been lost. None the less this served out to be a very good beer."
""
""
"O: Big DIPA. One of the most unbalanced I've ever had, it's pure teeth-chattering hops from start to finish. Bright, bold hop flavors and huge waves of bitterness."

"Overall: Definitely one of my favorite DIPA's that I have tried thus far. This beer is an eye-opener and it will leave you stunned and wanting more with each sip. I was quite surprised with Beer Advocate's rating of a 94, although 94 is an exceptional rating, I believe Hop Stoopid deserves at least a 95 or greater. From what I can tell this brew comes highly recommended and is simply fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is definitely a go to brew considering its perfect balance, ABV, and of course it's price tag!"
""
""
""
"It pours an orange gold with a decent white head and a hop explosion as it hits the glass. There is no doubt what you are in for with this beer and the initial taste was of juicy grapefruit with a slight bitter citrus that has a sweet malt body to keep it balanced. The Hop Stoopid is surprisingly easy to drink and leaves a wonderful hoppy coating on your palate. This is a great IIPA and delivers a hop bomb while keeping the beer balanced and drinkable."
""
""
"O: A truly amazing beer! I was very happy with my purchase and i will keep this as a stand by/staple in my fridge(fresh of course) the price point on this is what really shocked me $4.99 and i see it cheaper other places. wow! talk about bang for your buck. Great job Lagunitas. you have got yourself another happy customer."

"Damn near perfect. The smell told me it was gonna be good, it was. Very satisfied first taste. Just fill your nose then have a big taste, this is what a IPA should taste like as far as I am concerned. I have tasted a couple of better but this one runs in the same family of brews for sure."
"Overall - this beer was exceptional. For the amount of IBUs I wasn't expecting such a nice balance. I'll have another with some seafood and white sauce."
""
""
""

"o: Excellent beer, If I'm nitpicking it is a little sweet, I could use a little more finishing/dry hop bitterness, this is a great beer and I would be very happy drinking this every day."
"Overall a great DIPA and for the price point you can't complain. The is one that I overlook all the time but will definitely be revisiting soon. Really smooth with a drink-ability that's a little scary for 8%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Side note: I tried Hop Stoopid and Pliny the Elder on tap from their respective breweries in the same night. And Hop Stoopid was easily the winner for me. I get a more balanced citrus character, less piney hopes, and lesser mouthfeel (IPA vs. DIPA feel) with Hop Stoopid when compared."
""
""
"This beer is very well balanced and super drinkable. Crafted with logic and purpose; there's nothing stoopid about that."
"UPDATE: 12/11/2013 22 day old Hop Stoopid is DANK and resinous compared to the last time I had it."
"this is a good DIPA, but the smell and taste are a bit muted, i think. may need to revisit, with a fresher bottle. this should not be a problem, given the availability and price point in chicago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a fantastic imperial ipa. Easy to find cheap to buy and better than most of the competition"
""
""
"It's as if grapefruit juice, mango juice and a Corona Extra was combined to deliver this distinct flavor profile. It had a pronounced citrus flavor in the beginning. As I continued drinking, the citrus evolved into more of a hoppy/mild citrus constant. It had a pleasant aftertaste with a slight bitterness that reminded me of the grapefruit characteristic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'll keep searching for the perfect IPA, haven't found it yet!"
"O: A DIPA right up my alley. Plenty of complicity and nice balance. Cannot even tell it is 8% abv. My only gripe is that Lagunitas' rotating beers seem to be so similar in flavor. Regardless, it is hard to argue that when a beer is good, it is good."

"DATE TASTED: August 29, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... OCCASION: drafting while draughting (reused pun, for draft number 2)--a big-bodied beer for a big boy draft!... APPEARANCE: beautiful soft orange with a steady, centered eruption of bubbles; thick, creamy head is staunch and off-white--yes, perfect... AROMA: the shock and awe of the IBUs is on display, with the majority of the scent of a pine cone slicing through an orange, mango and pineapple simultaneously into a hop bomb shish kebob; as advertised ...PALATE: creamy, stirring thickness with an immediate warmth that seers, then cradles the throat; balanced overall, with a reasonable aftertaste...TASTE: delicious citrus (plum and pineapple pervade) are unrelenting; the alcohol metes its energy out as the glass drains; the aftertaste of funky yeast is a little difficult to take pleasure in... not knowledgeable enough to construe the good news/bad news of the label's CO2 hop extraction explanation, I defer to my senses and buy into its overt toasty malt/hop balance, mostly--not as much as Adrian Peterson being my #1 pick... OVERALL: this beer is BIG, blessed with a peripheral attractiveness and a substance that follows up reasonably on its initial promise...impossible to remove the hop from the teeth, like the Altoid of the beer world...worth the bomber and its relatively fair price tag..."

"UPDATE 3/5/14: I've been revisiting my top rated beers in order to see if they are where they should be. Had another bottle of this last night, bottled Jan., 8 2014. Nothing I would change in my earlier review of an apparently very old bottle, although I have had a few other different DIPAs since my review of this (many, actually) and some are as good if not a little better. So I'm altering the numbers I posted here slightly to reflect that. taste: 4.75 to 4.5; mouthfeel 4.75 to 4.25."
"O - 4.75 - great beer, amazing for the price, probably the most economical hop bomb out there"
""
"Pours a golden amber with white head, leaves a bit of lacing. Smells sweet with some citrus and pine. Taste follows the nose. More malty than I was expecting. Not really a hop bomb. So smooth and tastes amazing. Mouth is near perfect. Not too heavy or syrupy. Overall, a great DIPA. Way better than the regular Lagunitas IPA. If you have a hard time finding Pliny, this is the closest thing you're gonna get, and it's pretty damn close."
""
""
"O - What can I say, this is a great beer and one of my standard go-to's. Incredibly drinkable and perfectly balanced all around."
"Enjoyed this with AleBorland83 for his 30th birthday. The bottle states 102 IBUs however the beer was not super bitter at all. In fact, it almost tasted sweet. Not what I was expecting. I found a caramel flavor hidden amongst what was supposed to be a hop bomb. The malt profile was extremely pleasant and the alcohol well hidden. I love me some Lagunitas but this is not their best beer. It's still good and I would recommend it, especially at $4.99 for a 22 oz bomber in Brooklyn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not what I expected from a West Coast DIPA or a beer with 100+ IBU's. Beer is too malty/sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall I would give a maybe bad bottle a B+"
""
""
"This is a must have on draft. In bottle, I get a completely different taste- thicker, more carmel/syrup feel. I get this from the bottle time after time. On draft, it's much lighter, much more tasty and preferred. This was in my top 5 when I first tried it, but now, I don't know. Still in my top 50 though!"

"I just bumped this up from 4.0 to 4.25 based on how great it went with grilled Middle Eastern grilled chicken.  No doubt, this one is a hop bomb, based on it's name and +100 IBU's listed on the label, but Lagunitas has done a good job putting just enough of a malt backbone in this one to make it a winner.  The bonus is at $4.99 for a bomer, this one is a great bargain.  If you love the Lagunitas taste profile and a good hoppy DIPA, you could do much, much worse."

"I found this familiar craft beer at my local Tom Thumb. Good move by them, as this is a phenomenal value at under 5 bucks. This beer reminds me of the iconic Russian River brew of the exact same style; that's saying alot given Ive only tried Pliny once and at least a year ago. Hop Stoopid is one of the best DIPAs you can buy for your dollar. Safe to say now in my top 5 of the style. Im not sure why it took the convenience of a local chain grocery for me to retry it. If you're a hophead, you'll find this incredibly drinkable."

"Taste definitley is a big step up from the aroma. Taste starts with bread and pine, then moves on to intense grapefruit, along with lemon, and orange, ending with floral hops. Has a bready, floral, dry, and a bit grapefruity finish. Has an average body for a DIPA, a little creamy, with low carbonation."
""
"Pours clear and amber with a big head of tight, lazy foam that fell to some sticky lacing. Nose is rambunctious with bright citrus and more earthy, floral hops behind that. Malt is in the background like sweet bread. Comes to the palate like the nose with citrus, grass, pine and rich sweet malt for balance. Clean with tremendous bitter aftertaste that’s dry and unbounded. A great DIPA, smooth, yet big and bracing."

"Overall, this one lives up to the hype. Solid IPA from out west is what I've come to expect. Not quite as balanced as Pliny, but very good for an aggressively hoppy beer."
""
""
"Ever since I first had Hop Stoopid, I knew that it would set my standard for DIPAs. It has """all the basics""" of the style and begs me to take drink after drink, let me tell ya. This beer was brewed with one purpose... one which it fulfills exceptionally well: to deliver hops unto beer drinkers everywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was turned on to this California beer by a friend of mine. I wasn't sure what to expect other than a """hoppy""" beer. I was extremely satisfied with the color, aroma, mouthfeel and taste. I love a good hoppy beer. Hop stoopid combines a fine selection of hops with a delicate but unpretentious balance of malt and depth that makes it easy to drink. When it's gone... You'll wish the 20+ oz bottle was bigger."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hop stoopid pours a darkish golden color, with a nice large lasting head. Their is a strong floral aroma. The taste has a slight hoppy flavor, a pronounced malty backbone, and a strong bitterness. Good full flavor, but their is a weak hoppy taste, but a strong bitterness. Overall a good IPA, strange flavors, but enjoyable."

""
"O: This is a fantastic beer and is one of my new favorites! While the first thing that comes to mind with Hop Stoopid is buckets of hops, I am left impressed with the perfect balance of flavors. Even my hop-o-phobic wife really liked this beer!!"

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. My first beer from Lagunitas and I want more!"
""
""
"Great IIPA and the availability and price make it approachable. Hop extract used at its best."
""
""
"Overall: I'm very glad I was able to try this beer. At it's core, Hop Stoopid is a multi-talented Double India Pale Ale that dazzles the nose and tongue. I am left wanting more in the realm of taste, since Hop Stoopid feels sort of one-dimensional. Yet, a one-dimension Lagunitas DIPA is better than most of the market's offerings, especially beers that don't have the same amazing smells and feels that Hop Stoopd unleashes upon the brain. If you can find it, buy it. The experience is worth far more than the cheap $3.99 price tag."

"Poured into tulip. Golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head that leaves tons of lacing. Smells floral, with more dank hops. Taste is nice and clean, with bitter hops finishing out, and a nice malt backbone. Nicely understated; it avoids that spikyness that some DIPAs get. Crisp, well-balanced, delicious, with a medium full mouthfeel, nicely carbonated."
""
""
""
"A light amber in color with a thin tan head. Aromas of a pine forest. Taste begins with a big grapefruit start, then a solid sweet bread middle, and a piney finish. Mouthfeel is smooth. The carbonation was a bit lower than I would have liked, but nothing too bad. Overall quite a nice DIPA."

"Excellent, excellent double IPA. Petaluma is straight up the street from the legendary Russian River brew pub and brewery, and frankly, a little overlooked because of their wide distribution. I would put Hop Stoopid up against Pliny the Elder on just about any day and say it's an even match. Pliny is more grape-fruity, and Hop Stoopid has a little more funk. Both are clear, citrusy, hop-nectars of the Gods. I don't think I could take one over the other though, the only thing I really see hurting the Hop Stooped is that it is more widely available."

""
""
""
""
"overall: As a hop head, this hits the spot. Personally, while very similar, I like this better than Ruination. And for half the price, this will now be a daily drinker for me. Thank you Lagunitas, never had a bad beer from them, and the prices are unbeatable. This is a very hoppy, west coast style DIPA beer that does not disappoint."
""
""

"Overall - This is my first time trying this beer, and it was much hoopier than expected. If it were slightly more carbonated, it would be much smoother beer. But for what it is, very good, especially at it's price point."

"O-This is a middle-of-the-road IIPA. I give credit for keeping balance with the presence of the fruity, pale malts, but I could have used more complexity in the hop profile. I did not detect much in the way of tropical fruit or grapefruit, which I expect in a West Coast IPA like this one. For $5 a bomber, this is a decent deal, but there are better IIPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This ain't your average Imperial IPA. It is certainly a thirst quencher and has enough hops for a """hophead""". I'd like to see this beer at medium to medium-high carbonation to match the big 8% ABV and Imperial IPA profile, as I believe it's a tad under-carbonated."

""
""
""

"O: an excellent DIPA. One of my go-to's, Especially considering that it's relatively cheap compared to a lot of its rivals: I have found this beer for just over four dollars for a bomber."

"Overall-year round doubles don't get too much better than this. This compares very well to stones enjoy by, though the price point is better. I wish I could get this in my area, but instead I have to drive about an hour north to pick this up. Next time ill stock up. Worth the $5.99 price tag for sure. 4.25"
""
""
""
"Just a really good all-around beer. Solid head, good lacing. Smells fantastic, fully of flowery smelling hops. Tastes just like it smells, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is almost there, almost a bit watery after the sip. Loving Lagunitas beers so far, highly recommend this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Not sure when this was bottled (Would really like this info on the bottle) but it was a little strong on the malt. Alcohol and bitterness quite present. I did like the hopping flavors from what I got. Not bad, and at times I really liked it, but it just didn't work all the time. It had enough promisse that I'd love to try it again, but only if I was sure of its freshness."

"O: I might just have an old one, but I was not a big fan of this one. I will be sticking with Sucks. I'm gonna have to find one that I know is fresh or one straight from the brewery. Might have just found an IPA that I wasn't too big on."

""

"Not my favorite Lagunitas hop bomb but definitely solid."
""
""
""
""
"It is as described, hop stoopid. So much hop, but not crazy boozy and resiny like some DIPAs. Very enjoyable beer, especially if you like big dry hop."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an over-the-top beer. The name implies what you can expect from Hop Stoopid. What it lacks in appearance and aroma, it makes up for in obnoxious hoppy flavor. It's a fun beer for evenings where you don't want to spend any time thinking about what you're drinking. Sometimes digging for subtile flavors gets tiresome; and you just need instant gratification. At no point during the glass or bottle will it balance-out or settle down. It's going to hit you with a heavy dose of hops every sip, and its the beer you wish lackluster IPAs were daring enough to be."
""
"Overall – Bitter and moderately resinous with lots of hop flavor and malty tastes. A pretty decent imperial IPA, but a little too one dimensional in hop flavor for me. If you are looking for something with a over the head hop flavor, then this brew is good for you, but if looking for nice balance, then you may wish to look elsewhere."

"Well I would say out of Maximus, Sucks and this I prefer the other two a bit more but that is splitting hairs.... I buy this one less then the other because of the bomber format. It tends to sit on the shelves longer, but when it is fresh I always grab one. Really good stuff."

"O - A very nice double IPA, easier drinking than most"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a solid beer, I like the (somewhat weird?) grapefruit flavors, very drinkable, but I don't think it stacks up well to the rest of Lagunitas' offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 - for the price (typically $4-7), there aren't many better bargains for an imperial IPA on the market; I haven't had this beer in several years, and, on prior tasting, it's not nearly as bitter as I recall (or my bitter buds have been ablated by lots of IPAs in the intervening years...); I think that it's a little overrated on many websites and discussion boards but still enjoyable...something that I will go back to again when I'm looking for the best DIPA bang for my buck."
"O: A most excellent representative of the style. And at 4$ for a bomber it's like they're giving it away. Drink up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is excellent. Sweetness moderates the bitterness superbly. Every sip keeps you wanting more. 8 ABV? wow...hidden very well. I believe even non-IPA lovers would like this. Very impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: At 102 IBUs, I was expecting it to be over-the-top bitter. However, it had a very solid malt backbone and a good hop flavor and bitterness. While the bitterness was a bit more than the hop flavor, I enjoyed both. Admittedly, I’m a hophead, so I enjoyed this one."
"Overall - Not great, but not bad by any means. Not their best in my personal opinion, lacking that final """huzzah""". I think this brew might be a good introductory DIPA for someone just getting into the style."
"O - I have been avoiding this beer for awhile. I expected a bitter mess. I was very happy with the way this beer tasted and smelled. There is lots of citrus. I like Lagunitas and am not surprised that they made another good beer. I feel like a fool for not trying this beer sooner. It is tough to beat for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely my favorite offering from Lagunitas, all the aspects this brewery is known for come together quite well here. This is very, very easy to drink. I daresay I downed half of my glass in about 15 minutes. And the fact that it is extremely affordable (I paid $4.50) and easy to find makes it something that I will buy again when I need a good hop fix without stressing out what to buy."
""
""
"Overall: Not the most impressive appearance or smell but the taste and mouthfeel make up for it. Fantastic DIPA that I will continue to buy and enjoy for as long as it is produced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer , not a go to beer for me by far but I would pick up a 22 oz of it when Im in a location to get it , took a 200 mile round trip to get this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A pretty damn good DIPA for sure. I would love the chance to try one I know is super fresh."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good beer, a good DIPA for sure. Of course, there are better out there, and this one isn't readily available that I know of where I'm at. It is worth a try once, a pretty good beer, just nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer a lot. At this point, I may need to mix up my reviews to include something other than IPAs/Imperial IPAs but they're a great type of beer and very enjoyable. I think we can all agree that at this level of beer, it's very rare to have anything awful. These are all great beers and it ultimately comes down to availability in your area and price. Hop Stoopid for me is widely available and price pretty well so for that, it's hard to beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An awesome imperial at a fantastic price point. This proves that quality beer does not have to be super expensive."
""
"Overall: Great quality for the price tag. Definitely worth a try but nothing I would go crazy for. A different tilt for an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, great brew! Really enjoyed this one for only $5! Crazy!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"At $5 a pop for a bomber, this is a really solid DIPA. Nothing mind-blowing, but a super reliable and tasty brew. A great go-to when you want a nice DIPA that you don't have to hunt down or take out a second mortgage for."
"O- Not as good as sucks, but still very good, there is something in this beer (it may be Simcoe) that makes it very interesting. Very bitter, but enough flavor to balance it out. Lagunitas makes freaking good IPAs."
""
""
""
"S-22oz bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA and one of Lagunitas best beers. It is hoppier and bolder than their standard IPA. It pours an absolutely perfectly transparent bright golden amber with super sticky head and lacing. The aroma is a bit underwhelming, but still delivers plenty of hops and mild citrus. Huge hop flavor up front and some piney bitterness left behind. Sweet with some grass and mild malt. Dry mouthfeel. Similar overall to DFH 90 minute, but not as well rounded and complex. Still a great beer."

""
""

"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."

""
"O: Not the class of it's style, but still a very great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I recommend picking up a bottle (bombers at only $4-5 here) and enjoy this one. I will pick this up many more times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice enjoyable ale. I personally am not thrilled with it but it does not disappoint. The coloris agolden yellow. Pours with a nice fine dense head. The aroma is grassy and hoppy. The taste is essentially an ale. Nothing more. It has good body and depth."
""
""
""
"Overall - I'd drink it again, but I won't be rushing out to buy it. Lagunitas makes other brews that I love, and I will stick with those."
""
""
""
"O: I dug this one, and for only $4.99, the price was right!"
""
""
"after trying this beer, i still have to give it to Sucks, even though this is a fine brew in and of itself. nice color and clarity with pleasing carbonation and flavor make it solid. the hop extract was a new experience for me and while i enjoy the taste of whole cones as opposed to extract, this beer is a good bargain for $5 a bomber."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden honey color. Smells hoppy yet also some sweet with pine notes. A little thicker creamy head for an IPA-ish beer. Lots o' bubbles. It tastes pretty much like it smells, hints of pine and fruit notes along with a strong and bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is excellent, fizzy but pleasant and refreshing. Overall, I liked this beer. Not what I was expecting from the name, but probably something i would drink more of if it were on tap in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great hop presence in a well balanced brew. If I could pick a beer to represent the DIPA style this would have to be it: widely distrubuted, big and clean with both spice and fruit complexity."
"Taste- Hops, hops, more hops, and add some more hops the name fits this beer perfectly. Despite the fact that this beer is so hoppy and has 102 IBU's its not insanely bitter. Theres a good balance from the malt to keep this from being brutal if the hops had been left to their own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer, but if you don't like hops, avoid it like the plague. Blisteringly bitter in an uninspiring sort of way. I'd stick to actual hops rather than extract."
"I'm not giving lots of flavors but that's OK because this is a straightforward hop bomb, and rather well balanced. I've had this many times and at this price point it's one of the best hoppy beers around."

"Overall: Fits the bill for hop heads and non-hop heads alike – a very good middle-of-the-road and well-balanced IPA that should be a real crowd pleaser. Yet another good brew from Lagunitas."
"A very good beer, with a strong ABV kick, that is enjoyable and has a good mix of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice DIPA. Great for the price."
""
"Other than the fact that Lagunitas still doesn't bottle date, I'm not sure why I don't drink this more often. It's a great Imperial IPA that's available year round and an outstanding value. I never have a problem drinking 22oz of this classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slightly sticky. Carbonation is on the high side. Overall, this guy has settled it's way into my top 5 DIPA's. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"My experience with this beer matched all the good things I've heard about it. Definitely above average for an IPA, and I'm not surprised coming from lagunitas. This one is more malty/piney and less light and tropical. Must try for all hop heads."
""
""
""
"Overall: while the 102 ibu is intriguing, the fact that they use hop extract may decrease the hop bitterness. A beautiful beer. So balanced. A bomber may be the ideal serving size, as the profile changes as it warms up. Great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Incredible beer. I've been reading about Lagunitas beers for some time now and I can now confirm that this brewing company is the real deal. I will seek this beer out again. Not too hoppy (I don't really consider myself a hop-head) but an impressive blend of hoppiness with refreshing fruit taste. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a much better experience. I don't know if the other bottle was old or if my palate was just yet to develop, but this is one of the more solid imperial ipas available in my state. Definitely going to buy again"
""
"(4.25) D: A great DIPA that's well executed and a good benchmark for the style with standout qualities across the board. Definitely worthy of a purchase, and then a future repurchase."
""
""
"Excellent beer from a great brewery. All elements of the beer from the color to the taste blend in balance."
"Overall: a delicious beer, esepcially for the price (3.99 pre-tax for a bomber) Lagunitas makes exceptional beers at very reasonable prices. Will buy again."

"A simple but great beer. I think they have really mastered the basics with this beer."

"O: Overall, an awesome beer. Ive been seeing this beer on the shelf for years and have never picked it up. Big mistake. Really great brew from top to bottom. Im not sure how I feel about liking a beer so much that is made from hop extract, but that discussion is for another day. Bottom line is, this is something I will certainly be drinking again in the near future. Great price point too ($4.49 for 22oz bomber). Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice brew overall. Well worth the hype/reputation. Only thing i missed was may be some bitterness at 102. Sad for me. I will need to revisit this."
""
""
""
"O: true to the label the focus of this beer is the hops, malt is there to make it drinkable, there are better more balanced DIPAs readily available but this beer will satisfy the craving for huge bitter hop flavor"
""
""
""
"Hops in this are crazy intense. But it is pretty fresh and interesting, tons of flavour, complexity is really nice. A really nice take on a TIPA even with a slightly lower ABV it still feels really big. Bitterness is balanced pretty well and it makes for a really nice brew."

"O - glad i finally tried this one. another solid offer from lagunitas, though a bit one dimensional . . . but i think it's presented that way, so i think they achieved their goal."

"O- very drinkable for the ABV, well balanced with a smooth finish, good stuff."

"O - a solid representation of the style, big hop profile and half the price of most others of similar qualities. Would highly recommend to people looking for strong hop profile at an affordable price..$4.29 for a 22oz bomber!"
""
""
"Pours light amber color, white single finger head. Great balance of malt and hops. Has that warm imperial texture with sweet fruity finish. Piney and citrusy with subtle dry hoppy finish, subtle dark fruit finish too. Like everyone says, can't pass a try for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear coppery amber with a fine, creamy, white head. Aroma is very resiny, mild fruity, peach and grapefruit. Medium carbonation, nice creamy and dry mouthfeel even if it does feel a little light. Flavor, naturally, has a lot of hops. Peachy, piney, resiny. Fairly sweet as the initial flavor with a heavy bitter and very dry aftertaste. Very good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A really good IPA and for the value, there is nothing better (except Pliny on the west coast). This really hits the spot for any hop head and can hold it's own against many of the best IPAs out there."

"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. Pours a hazy burnt orange, with a white head, one finger, some lacing. Smell is my favorite characteristic. Sweet cream and pine resin hops. Taste is similar but a little less sweet. Plenty of hops. Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall delicious, one of my favorite Lagunitas beers."
"Pours like them all, and everlasting lacing. Smells malty and sweet and resins, but not really terrifically hop-prominent on this one. On the more floral/pine than citrus side. Actually, as a bit of stale-ness on the nose, if you know what I mean. Taste is terrific though. Sweet and bitter and hoppy and all that, and with a bitter sustain that really delivers. Maybe a bit malt forward, probably because this might be two or three months old too. Still delivers, although I think I'd rate this higher if was fresher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a slightly above average west coast style IPA. The flavors and aromas held up pretty well for the bottle being a little past its prime. The real draw of this beer is the price, though. At $4.50 a bomber, this stuff is one of the best deals you can get for a bomber."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm guessing that this one would be better if fresher as a lot of the hop flavor I expected seems to have faded. Still a quality beer, quite smooth and it does still have some wonderful wet hops at the finish."
""
""
"O: I am very much pleased with this 22oz bottle of Hop Stoopid. As a Lagunitas fan, I had high expectations prior to trying this strong hoppy ale, and they were all exceeded. You are getting more than just an aggressive hop bomb in this offering from California's Lagunitas Brewing Company. The Hop Stoopid's name will fool you; it is a thoughtfully crafted, hoptastic brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O...what a great beer. An excellent example of a west coast ipa but, when you add a great price point into the equation this brew is a huge winner. I will be buying this again asap. if youre a hop head, this is a must try...again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - $4.49?? Are you serious!? BY FAR the best $4.49 22 I've ever had, plus a lot more. Very bitter/sweet/drinkable. At this price point... it's going to be a regular in my fridge! Tremendous value"
""
"O- I remember having this a couple years ago and saying it was too bitter for me. I'm glad I revisited it because my palate is a bit more receptive to the nuances occurring underneath all the alpha acids. Couldn't see myself drinking more than a bomber of it, but I guess that's why Lagunitas went with the 22 oz. size for this one which is kind of rare for them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good double ipa. Delicious hop aroma and flavor, not overly bitter, but like some dipas, a bit on the sweet side. Hop character was not extreme, as in some of the more brutal examples."
"Pretty Good. Pale orange with a fleeting bright white head. Prunes and sweet malt dominate the nose, with a little hop bitterness in the background. Hops arent overly flavorful, but are certainly there for bittering. Nice and balanced. Initial dry fruit/ bready sweetness falls into a sharp hop bitterness,although both linger through the finish. Nice and thick for an IPA with sharp but passive carbonation. Good beer, but probably not exactly what you are looking for if you want big hop flavor and aroma"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This IPA gets a solid 4. It's not mind blowing, but cheap and tasty. I'll gladly drink it anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Hard to beat for the price point. A really good hop monster here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer for hop-heads, though. 5 mins after the last sip, my tongue feels like it's still coated in bitter hop residue. And for $5 for a bomber from my local deli, you can't beat the value. Overall: thumbs up."
"O - one of my favorite double IPAs...especially for the price!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Better strong IPA's exist but I enjoyed this brew for sure. Would I buy it again? Possibly it would have to be a special occasion, but definitely not a regular evening beer. Certainly on the fence about it."
""
""
"That is all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not my favorite IIPA but in the top 5. For the price it really can't be beat. I would have liked to see a little more malt balance and complexity but I have a feeling this will become a regular in my fridge."
"Drink this beer. You will not find a better ipa for the price. Seriously. You can spend the $4 and enjoy it. This beer is bitter. Super bitter. High alcohol. And ipa to the max. $8 beer will be put to shame 7/10 times. Don't think the price makes this less of a beer. Trust me."
"If you like IPAs ... go buy this... Hell, buy 5 for the price!! Most beers are so expensive that the sticker shock kills the quality ! haha"
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer, really enjoyed this one, great hoppy nose and finish, body was a bit thick for my pallet, this one is a good example of a one and done, if you are looking for something to totally consume your pallet then go for it, I would happily buy again!"
"Seriously great beer. Amazing flavor, so full of pines, resins, and hops that are counterbalanced perfectly by the fruity citrus, grapefruit, and pineapple flavors which ironically come from the hops as well. Slight malt finish puts a nice close on things. I recommend this beer to everybody."
"O: Wonderful IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear amber pour, bubbles of carbonation rise from the bottom of the glass, to greet a small fizzy white head. Aroma of herbal and citrusy hops, and not much else. More of the same in the taste, hops and hops, citrus pith, herbal notes, pale malts. Bitter and drying, light-medium body, tamed alcohol. Not a bad beer overall, but nothing amazing going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent DIPA. Love the juicy qualities and perfect balance."
"O - Even after the huge smell and big flavor, this beer is quite easy to drink. For the hop homies out there, you gotta give this one a try."
""
""
""
""
"O – Fantastic beer! Start slow, and keep on slow, because it is a hoppy son of a whore that will wreak havoc on your taste buds if approached lightly. I recommend spending about an hour with a glass of this because it tends to show different characters over time as it warms and as the carbonation starts to die. A fun beer packed full of hoppy flavor that never leaves you underwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very good DIPA, leans more toward a regular IPA than a true """double""" - both in body and flavor profile - so its a nice middle ground between the two. I'd buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Hop Stoopid lives up to it's name, and it's reputation as one of, if not the best value in the IPA/DIPA market today. Easily accessible, seems to always be pretty fresh, and the value CANNOT be beat. I paid $4.99 for this bottle, hard to beat that. I've tried most of the big name IPAs and DIPAs, and Hop Stoopid could compete with most of them. I don't usually like to compare beers to each other, but Hop Stoopid really does taste pretty damn close to Pliny. Just a little more malty and not quite as dry, so if you want to try Pliny but can't get your hands on any, just go down to the corner market and pick yourself up some Hop Stoopid, it's about half the price for a beer that's world class...in my opinion. Now if only Lagunitas would put this beer out in 6 packs....Anyways, I'm rambling. Hop Stoopid is an A beer, if you haven't tried it then stop reading this review and get your ass out there and get some!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Its a pretty stand up beer, its laid back and rich, its complex, aromatic, but as the name implies, its super enriched with hops so if that's not you, then you might not like it. Its not me either but I' enjoyed it so I recommend this beer."
""
""
"One of my gateway beers into craft beer, but haven't had it since and boy, do I regret it. What a great looking beer. Clear, golden orange with a tall fluffy white head. Lacing left all around the glass. Tropical fruit notes, piney and floral notes abound in both the nose and taste. Goes down smooth with a perfect balance of bitterness.

"Tastes almost exactly like their Little Sumpin Sumpin Pale Wheat Ale, with an ever so slight alcohol twinge at the end. For a more in depth review, read my review of Little Sumpin Sumpin. Just seems kind of lazy on Lagunitas part. Solid beer though, but not one I'd seek out."

"Cheers!"

""

""
"Final Thoughts: When I first smelled this one, I had my doubts. However, with each sip I appreciate it more and more. For $3.99 a bomber it's well worth the price. Would I drink it again? Yes, after I've tried all the other DIPAs I've got my eyes on."

"Appearance is leaning toward more copper than gold. Well filtered and clear. Good head to start with finer carbonation but disappates to almost nothing and leaves little lacing. Smell is piney hops. Taste is more of the same but reveals a sweetness and candy like flavor on the back end. Another good DIPA."

"O: Hard to beat for the price point. A really good hop monster here."
"a very fine and quite sizable ipa. looks gorgeous, tons of white lacing and a puffy white head that stays an inch tall the whole time. sticky honey colored liquid, immaculately clear, with slowly rising little bubbles looking all lazy and carefree like a lava light. the nose is definitely on the sweeter resiny end of the hop spectrum, oily and fruity. thats all i really smell here. flavor is very bold on the hops, and although its over 100 ibu's, it doesnt seem very bitter to me at all. there is a tropical fruit vibe that hits before and after the bitter that really tames it. its going great with some russian rye bread and sharp cheese, but i could also imagine it going well with a big rare steak. there is a very summery feel to this ipa, less abrasive than many, and far more drinkable. the mouthfeel is velvety and smooth, its rich, but not as oily as i thought it would be from the extract and from the nose. its got well moving carbonation and it finishes long and intriguing. overall a pretty good beer here, especially for less than 5 bucks a bomber."

"Overall, this ale utilizing hop extracts is one of my favorites, the very definition of a hop bomb."
""
""
"M: Medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, a little tacky."
""
"O: The hops bitterness is the focus of this IPA. It has a strong hops bitterness, and the earthiness and the pineness and grapefruit do just enough to add an interesting element of complexity. Overall, this is a really good hops bitterness focused brew, and it is very much worth seeking out."
""
"O - A very good DIPA that is quite underrated in my opinion - especially for its price. It's been a while since I've had this and I've forgotten how tasty it was."

"I don't see why I wouldn't pick up another bottle of this although more than one might give me heartburn due to the sheer amount of hops."
""
""

"O: It’s fairly one-dimensional, but I think it may be designed that way. I really enjoyed this but I’d probably prefer to share the next bottle with a friend or two."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a golden-amber tan color with tremendous foam. Cascading foam, in fact. The aroma is a full-frontal assault of grassy hops followed by an aggressively hoppy taste profile. Crank this one to 11. Grassy green, some pine, and a surprisingly light body deliver full-on hop intensity. I found some tropical fruit notes come through, with pineapple and floral notes dominating, and a lingering finish that mixed pineapple, floral notes, and some piney resin. If this is what you’re looking for you will not be disappointed. Not for the faint of heart."
""
"O: There are 102 IBUs here and you can taste them. If you want to taste a prime example of a West Coast style - I'd recommend grabbing a few of these and settling in for a nice weekend. This beer is absolutely fabulous with spicy food. Shredded pork tacos with lots of hot sauce."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer was extremely mediocre. It falls so far short of the IBU chest thumping on the label that I wonder if its underachieving wasn't part of the joke. For a beer of 102 IBUs, it has a very low perceived bitterness. The hop profile seems passive and flat too. No 'pop' to it at all. It's fairly priced at $6 a bomber, but even so, I'll pass on it in the future. Look to Lagunitas Maximus for a much better deal in both quality and price."
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a nice white head that laces decently, though not as much as I would expect. Fine hop nose with a good dose of pine, earth and dankness with hints of citrus fruit. Light alcohol is found beneath it. The body continues in a similar vein, though the hop flavours are weaker and give way at times to the booze. Tons of pine, plays well with the biting bitterness that is barely balanced by the nice dry body. As always I am left wanting more hops!! Regardless a solid well put together DIPA that was quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is another impressive beer from Lagunitas. I'm really glad it is now available in Maine. I'll certainly enjoy this one again!"
""
"Lagunitas Hop Stoopid Ale has a thin, off-white head and a clear, bubbly, orange-golden appearance, with some lacing left down the glass. The aroma is very piney and orange-smelling. Plus, some breadiness shows up. Taste is full of pine resin, citrus, orange peel, sugar, and bread. For a 102 IBU beer, it’s just NOT that bitter. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and Lagunitas Hop Stoopid Ale finishes dry and refreshing. Overall, this is a wonderful beer. RJT"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Where the nose lacks complexity, the taste makes up for it with the huge hop flavor. The bitterness isn't actually too bad, especially for registering at 102 IBUs. Plus, at $5.49 a bomber, this is a steal for a solid DIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is medium bodied with nice full lively carbonation. This is a delicious bitter astringent bomb for those of us into that. Yum."

""

""

""
""
"I've tried this beer at least half a dozen times in various states of freshness. The best bottle I have had was an extra from a CA trading partner. That was a mind-blowing beer. Everything we get here on the East coast lacks that blast of hop deliciousness I got from the West coast bottle. And before you ask, I got the bottle, shook my head, and thought, """Well, I know I'm not a huge fan of this, might as well chill it and drink it tonight.""" I was so wrong."
""
"Poured from a 22-oz bottle into my typical beer glass. This one has a golden, almost pilsner quality with a nice white head and good lacing for an imperial. Great smell with lots of floral and pine. The real strength of this beer is the flavor--great hopiness!!! Not only that, but there's a solid malty sweetness. This is probably the most balanced imp IPA I've had in awhile...highly recommend!"

"Overall:  Finely crafted, well balanced hop bomb from Lagunitas.  If you are an IPA lover, this beer will satisfy.  The reasonable price will satisfy as well.  Excellent IPA that I will seek out in the future.  Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours deep clear golden orange with a tall, biege head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving lacing on the side of the glass. Only a small amoutn of head is left atop the beer after the head retreats. Small, tiny bubbles can be seen rising along the side of the glass. The hop aroma is very strong. I detect those big piney, resinous and citrus hop aromas. There is some sweetness as well. It's a very delicious smelling West Coast IPA. As far as the taste goes, the hops aren't as powerful as the smell would indicate. Those big, juicy citrus flavors are balanced with that bitter pine flavor in the back end. The malt really doesn't come through in the flavor, which allows the balanced hop flavors to shine. The body is much lighter than the typical double IPA, registering on the lower end of medium. There isn't a lot of carbonation to speak of, but it is there. This beer is smooth with a dry finish. It is highly drinkable in terms of the style. This is an excellent and unique beer in many ways. If you're a hop head, do try this beer if you can find it."
"O: very well made beer. Lagunitas again delivers with this double IPA. Glad to have finally checked this one out. Affordabe at $7.00. Thanks for a delicious beer."

"overall a solid very drinkable beer. which there was a brewed on or a drink by date to gage whether or not i'm sampling a misleading bottle. not living up to its Hop Stoopid name."
"O: Great example of the style. If you're looking for hops you can't go wrong here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a wine glass, dark golden pour, quickly fading inch head with variety of bubble sizes. Scent of pine, fresh grapefruit and some hint of funkiness. Taste follows the nose, strong grapefruit, pine, and funk. Excellent hoppy brew, almost no malt in sight. Somewhat light mouthfeel which I feel suits this very hop heavy style. Fantastic, and very refreshing, would drink again."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall this beer is very understated. The name would suggest a huge beer but it's very balanced even without tasting any malt. I know it's fresh because I brought it back from CA, so it didn't sit on a shelf or in a truck for a long time. Great beer, I wish I could get it here in IL. Even the burps taste/smell good."
"OVERALL: A great beer from Lagunitas, with all the hop character that die hard hop heads can't deny, but a solid enough balance that it could appeal to a broader spectrum of beer drinkers. Also, affordably priced, so it is a good fridge staple."
""
""
"Overall, this is an average IIPA. This is about what I would expect from an IIPA, but I would hope for more. I certainly didn't feel that the flavor or the smell was well better than average for the style. I did, however, feel the price was WAY better than average for the style, and that boosted the overall score. 8% ABV, tastes good, easy to drink, doesn't destroy the palate, and it's really cheap? Certainly worth buying again for these reasons. Not a knock your socks of kind of beer, but a knock your socks off beer when considering the price."
"I had this beer over three years ago, and I thought it smelled strongly of cat urine. Either the aroma has changed, my nose has changed, or that was an odd batch. Anyway, I approve of this bottle. In terms of Lagunitas DIPAs, I think it's better than Maximus but not as good as Sucks. Very drinkable, easy to polish off a bomber."
"Nearly full-bodied with medium effervescence. Warming mostly in the mouth/palate. A slight drying of the upper palate as well. A pretty good beer."
"You might think I am crazy but this is one of the most refreshing, full hop flavored (dry hop type) and balanced IPAs period. I have tried IPA after IPA and Stone is of the finest but this in some ways has a more defined citrus, grapefruit and pine tastes that make american IPAs sooo good. I have had too many poor IPAs and this is of the TOP FIVE, ohh and considering the price, JEEZ can't be beat. Body is on the lighter side and it goes down sooo easy, maybe too easy could find yourself in trouble as it makes you want more."
""
""
""
"The beer exited the brown bomber to reveal a dark amber clear liquid with a modest head above with clung to the sides of the glass. The aroma seamlessly melts into the flavor. The strong hop presence includes grapefruit, floral and a touch of pine around the edges. The bitterness abounds but the caramel is strong enough to provide just enough balance to make this go down clean and balanced. A modicum of resin is residual. Nice brew."
""
""
""
"This beer is certainly all about the hops but is complex enough to keep me interested. Another tastey beer from lagunitas."
"O- Awesome DIPA. The price, the drink ability, the flavor and of course the dirt cheap 4.50$ price tag is all fantastic. For some reason, this beer is not sold in my area and I found it first 5 hours outside my city. Dear Lagunitas, distribute to Kentucky."

"This unassuming beer really took me by surprise. It`s a beautiful straw colour, not much head but it lingers and it`s quite creamy. The smell has a huge floral component, backed by grapefruit. Taste is dominated more by grapefruit backed by pine. It`s an intensely hopped beer, as you might expect by its name. The mouthfeel is slightly oily up front but finished dry. Overall, this is a perfect example of the style and should be tried by every IPA fan."

"O: again, can't beat value, however this falls a bit short of being at the top of the DIPA class. Starts wrong but just doesn't hold it together."
"overall this is a pretty solid ipa with a modest abv.. a bit """bitter only""" which isn't TOO bad in this case since there are a few different hop characteristics, though i think it could have used a bit more balancing with floral/aromatic hops somewhere in the mix."
""
"O - I'd give this a 4.0 here if were typically priced as most Douche Bag DIPA prices ($6.99+) but at $3.50 a bomber, this is the benchmark of the entry level style! Much 143! Lagunitas!"
"O: A very tasty and very enjoyable beer that is somewhat easy to drink. I expected that this beer would have been tougher to drink with the massive amount of IBUs. There is a slight presence of alcohol but it is not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer was excellent. It had a great hop aroma and taste that was balanced well with the malt sweetness, and the mouthfeel was maybe the best that I’ve ever had from a DIPA. It had a great body, awesome carbonation, and a superb bitter finish that hung around for a while. Furthermore, the 8% ABV was completely hidden. This was an awesome offering from Lagunitas. Definitely a must-try for hopheads."

"Always a pleasure to drink a DIPA with such a lovely nose redolent of great BC bud. The smell lingered to the last drop while the hops in the beer never overpowered the malt backbone. like most Lagunitas beers balance was the key to making this such a great big beer. I felt like having another though the 8% was apparent pretty quick."

"What can I say now? I love buying this for cheap, I love reading the surrealist blurb about Mikey on the side of the bottle, I'm happy with the strange image of the unsturdy-looking cabin on the label, the hop nose rocks, the taste is a bitter rejoicing, the feel is much above-par... I mean, this beer is 'Stoopid' good. 4.5"
""
""
"O- A great adventure in hops. Easy to drink for something with 8% ABV."
""
"Appearance is a crystal-clear amber with a thick white head with good retention. The smell is oustanding - huge mango and grapefruit scents The taste is as hopped up as the smell suggests. Tart, juicy, bitter grapefruit flavors dominate from start to finish. Good mouthfeel, but not great. Perfect for a hop lover like me."

"O - This is a fine, well-crafted, mature, artful beer. The combination of flavor notes in the aroma and taste are just great. I'll definitely buy it again, and soon, to scratch the IPA itch. This is a classy and memorable beer. No bomber is a good deal compared to sixpacks, but at $4.50 for a 22oz., it's a better deal than just about anything else I've found. Keeper."

"A very easily drinkable beer, especially for being above 8 abv. Very well rounded and drinkable, solid offering from Lagunitas. A definite value and un-regrettable purchase. I would seek this beer out again."

"O- Have had this a few times and as far as value beer this is right up there with torpedo. Go Lagunitas!"
""
""
"O: Great brew. This is one of those beers that doesn't have anything technically wrong with it. I appreciate a beer that takes risks, and that's not present here. However, the positives of this beer best the ho-hum-ness. Plus, this beer isn't hyped like PtE -- so (as wrong as this may be) it gets points that PtE doesn't."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The more I get into big, hoppy beers, the more I find that many DIPAs come across too alcoholic and bitter compared to simple IPAs. While this one still had those issues, the fantastic flavor profile really made up for it. I'm really glad I found a bottle of this and I can say it's certainly worth the hype."
""
""
""
"O - An excellent double IPA from Lagunitas. Above average for the style, and highly drinkable. Also very affordable for such a high quality beer."
""
""
"O: I have had this beer several times and don't remember it being this complex. There are so many flavors that can be drawn from this beer. Thank you Lagunitas."
""
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden/orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is big on hops, some citrus. Taste is stoopid hops, very bitter, some citrus notes, more bitterness, alcohol is well hidden. Feels full bodied and bitter in the mouth and overall should scratch the itch of your average hop head."
""
""
"O- I thouroughly enjoyed this beer. I have had this beer on a few different occasions in the past and I forgot how good it is. I am glad Lagunitas is expanding because I really want to try all the Hop Stoopid variants."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The thing I don't understand with this beer is the IBU's. Maybe I let this beer sit around too long which could very well be, but I didn't get much bitterness at all with this beer. Even with that, I gave this beer a nice rating. A VERY citrusy beer, and I like it! I may come back and edit this review once I try a nice fresh bottle."

"Overall this is a solid go-to DIPA that I don't buy often enough. Would love to see this one in 12oz cans."
"This is a pretty good IPA. A pretty decent hoppiness to it. The hops really hit strong up front on the sip, but less so in the aftertaste of the swallow than some beers. In particular, I found this to be a bit too carbonated for my taste. The tanginess of the citrus/grapefruit flavors also stand out a bit much, threatening to overwhelm the bitterness of the hops. A pretty tasty IPA, that isn't bad if you are looking for hop heavy beer, but not the full fledged hop heaviness you might expect from the name."
""
""
"Overall this is a very good beer. Not my favorite IPA, but one I've had several times and enjoyed."
"This is a great DIPA and totally a great deal. Very hoppy and incredibly well hidden ABV. Another great West Coast hop bomb. Seek it out. Now."
"Pours a nice pale golden amber. Good amount of white/off-white head. Good retention. Mounds of hop aroma, ranging from citrus (pineapple, orange), to pine to floral to grassy. Great hop depth here. Taste is quite bitter and dominated by hops. Following the nose with citrus, pine, and grass. Not much left for the malt, but some caramel sweetness sneaks through. Mouthfeel is quite bitter and puckering, but it's a good thing. Overall a fine IPA beer, I thought 102 IBUs would be more bitter than this, but that's not a complaint. The taste and aroma really shine here."

"They should bring this into 6 packs. But it's still hard to beat 4.50$ for a 22 oz. bottle."

"Poured from a fresh 22 oz bomber. Pours a very light orange with a fingers worth of an off white head that leaves pretty good head lacing. The aroma’s are of citrus, tropical fruits and grass with very a very similar taste. Medium to light body with plenty of hop bitterness hanging around in the after taste."
""
""
""
"Overall: For 8% alcohol, this beer is unbelievably drinkable. I definitely appreciated the scent of the brew--floral and fruity. Wholeheartedly recommend this brew. Very drinkable and approachable for all kinds of beer enthusiasts!"

"O- What a great way to finish the day. Run out and get one of these right away."

" Medium bodied and dry."
""
""
""
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice color, but not much of a head and only nominal lacing. The hops takes the day, but has a little balance with some sweet and floral notes in the nose. Flavor is mostly just hop bitterness. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"Wow. Not much to add over what's been said. One of my fav's. Balanced, drinkable for 8%, creamy, hoppy, smoove not easy to trap in one bottle. Nice lace, somewhat unfiltered. Nice to be able to pick this up anywhere anytime without much fuss. Enjoy."

"A favourite that I can't believe I haven't rated. Bring on the Dipa, us beer is Black Flag, Fear, Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedys and Naked Raygun all in the same glass. Ok enough of the punk rock analogies love this double ipa and although my rating was on draft this was a bottle tonight and the Simpson's episode that inspired this rating."
"This is a good< well rounded beer. for it being """102""" i.b.u. (4 u) it certainly doesn't taste THAT """hoppy""". the 8% alcohol is a welcoming expierence. i like it. aromas of hops and taste of hops, also there is a slight sweetness to it it. i didn't care for this beer the first time i had it but trying it again was a great idea! some of """Lagunitas""" products have been a """miss""" but this is definatley a hit!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice DIPA. I actually look forward to this beer. Yes it's crazy bitter, but the lack of harshness and interesting pine resiny character makes it more that just a bitter beer. The light body and distinct lack of sweet maltiness helps make this more drinkable."
""
"Overall - Simple in flavor, despite the (very) hoppy kick it provides. With it's awesome flavor and crisp feel on the palate, this is another fine offering by Lagunitas and another great Imperial IPA for hopheads to try out!"
""
"D- its lack of super extremeness makes it a more drinkable brew and the 8% abv packs only a mild punch. The 102 ibu boasted on the label is balanced out by the sweetness and though it is indeed a tasty combination of hops, perhaps hop stoopid is a deceiving name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A well made 2IPA. Don't let the 102 IBU's fool you, for the style it's quite drinkable. Certainly one I'd buy again."

"Comfortable mouthfeel via medium-intensity carbonation with a medium-heavy body, this slides right along the palate with an enjoyable viscosity. Finish is dry and a bit sticky from the ethanol or malt."

"Overall (4.0): Hop Stoopid is always enjoyable. In my mind it’s not quite a DIPA, it’s really just a standard (but well-done) American IPA on some steroids—no massive body and not quite enough ABV to compare to a lot of the better DIPAs out there. But it is what it is, and that’s how I’m judging it: a strong IPA with a buttload of piney, bitter-citrus hops on the palate and a buttload of sweet-citrus hops in the nose. That said, in this realm of Strong IPA/Pseudo-DIPAs, I think Sucks is a better, more balanced and dynamic beer, and certainly a better value. Still, I’ll go for Hop Stoopid every once in a while in the future, no doubt. Dear Lagunitas, HOP STOOPID SIXERS PLEASE."
""

"O (4) - It's a really interesting beer. It's almost an experiment in bittering and the kind of high peaks hops can reach. They say it's brewed with extracts to try to reach these high levels, which kinda makes sense from the way that it tastes. For me it's great because I love the combination of grapefruit and copper in an IPA/DIPA, but it's definitely more of an IPA for those looking to see some of the different elements taken to the extremes without too much else going on to spoil the show."

"Overall - a great beer, that is surprisingly easy and enjoyable to drink."
"O - Enjoyably and highly session-able for $3 a bomber. The folks at Lagunitas have created a well controlled hoppy brew but it leaves me feels they did it at the expense of diluting other characteristics. Good, but I have enjoyed much IPA's."
"This is actualy a slight disappointment for me. I respect these guys so much and this is one of their signature brews but it just seems this one is a little raw and undisciplined. Certainly nothing wrong with this one but it didn't blow my mind either."
""
"This beer tastes more sweet than hoppy. Still, it's very tasty and very easy to drink."
""
""
"Exceptional value DIPA, readily available when you need it, well priced and delivers both in hops and balance. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic stand out DIPA I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very solid DIPA. The price is excellent as well. I'd like to see this in sixers. Glad I finally tried this after seeing it for so long without giving it a go. Can't go wrong with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic DIPA. I've come to expect excellent beers from Lagunitas and this one is no exception. Would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. I'm always pleasantly surprised with the smoothness in most Lagunitas IPAs. Not really hop stoopid, More like hop struggling with 9th grade algebra."
""
"Bottom line: grab some they are worth it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: excellent example of DIPA style."
"O: Well, now that the boot is starting to really piss me off, it's time for the overall opinion, Double IPAs are my favorite style of beer, and this isn't really living up to my standards, it fits the 8% into a generally acceptable (single) IPA flavor quite well, as in it has hardly the amount of tongue wrenching tenacity that Sierra Nevada Torpedo has (7.2%) that many may find unpleasant. Not me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A great DIPA that I am glad to get my hands on and a stealthy 8% as well."
"Totally dominant and delicious. Was on my lips until the end of the evening."
""
""
"O) I'm not sure how I managed to overlook Lagunitas for as long as I did, but they sure do produce some well crafted brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has been and will always be a go to DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- great beer. For a beer over 100 ibu's this incredibly well balanced but not for the faint if heart. Also very affordable at half the price if it's competitors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very refreshing. Enjoyable."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours a dark golden color with a good one finger head that has some staying power, and leaves quite good lacing. Real nice floral and citrus notes, and you can definitely smell the hoppiness of this DIPA. Definitely the hops hit you right away, but a nice citrusy taste with a little hint of pine. Overall the tastes are very balanced. The beer is quite balanced with its carbonation and goes down surprisingly smooth for a beer with so much alcohol. Overall, an exceptional beer that is one that I enjoy, and hope to more often, very much."
"O. 4 great combination, hoppy aNd piney but also has a nice malty flavor."
"Poured into a 13 oz glass, dated 016 finally fresh. Pours a clear orange with a one inch sticky white head, nice lace. Smell is large pine, marijuana, orange, and pineapple. Taste is all of that, with dank marijuana leading the way, with a grapefruit finish. A big body for the style, plenty of life, not dry, and very drinkable. This is my style double IPA, love this fresh."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium light with a fairly dry finish and good carb."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely worth trying if you can get it. If you like IPA's with fruity hop flavors/aromas this is a good one."
"O: Good stuff, hope I can taste this next to a Devil Dancer, both fresh this year"
"O- Good, but not great. Wouldn't seek it out as I have many other readily available (better) options, but certainly not bad by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer as it has the powerful nose you'd expect from a DIPA and a good punch of hops but none of the syrupy heavyweight feel; light and bitter. In a way a would prefer a stronger malt base, but the very lightness of it is what makes it stand out. Very very drinkable DIPA that smells absolutely incredible."
"Mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated. Very good."
""
""
"Serving type: bomber"
""
""
"O - Wow. Now this is a true Cali DIPA."
""
"O-Hate to be boring here, but it's 4/5 across the board, I was hoping for more but it's no Ruination..."
"O: This is one of my number 3 DIPA behind the Firestone Walker Double Jack and the Devil Dancer. This is a yum yum IPA only for the hop monsters."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall still one of my favorite double IPAs."
"Poured into tulip, clear carrot body with bubbly white head. Lots of herb & spice hops in the aroma, not so strong though. Very full and balanced flavor, some strong grapefruit and spice rounded out by a malty sugariness, hint of vanilla. Bit of a bitter aftertaste, insane balance. Good crispy, creamy body, lots of carb that doesn't disturb the flavor. A burst of flavor on the palate overall. Some alcohol warming. This is solid, pretty light feel for a double. Great taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lagunitas proves that they are one of the better California breweries, and that should say a lot because of the stiff competition in that state. Also, their beers are more reasonably priced than most. Recommended."
"O: This is EXACTLY what I look for in an IPA: satisfying, balanced, refreshing, bold, and inexpensive. I'm starting to like Lagunitas a lot...now, if only I could get my hands on Lagunitas Sucks..."
"O: Its not that great. Far too sweet for my palate. I like the smell but the sweetness is a little too overpowering."
""
"Very good beer. Good balance with a clean and crisp mouthfeel."
"Overall, a very nice beer. This bottle is fresh, the price is smokin, and I'd buy it again. Cheers!"

"O - Excellent Imperial IPA, less EtOH flavor than I expected but its only 8%. I'd drink this anytime I wanted a great IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a transparent amber-orange color with a 3/4 inch white head. Head retention isn't great, but it leaves a little lacing in my glass as I drink. Smell is of grapefruit and pine. In the taste I get a pungent flavor of grapefruit against a backing of light malts, as well as some pine, maybe a touch of floral hops. Mouthfeel is slightly heavier than average, where it ought to be for a DIPA, with a bit of carbonation. This is a great west coast IPA. It certainly ranks among the best regularly available DIPAs."
"Edit: This bottle must've been extremely fresh. Had again slightly older, and not nearly as delicious. I had to balance out the review, especially considering there's no bottle dating. Big reason why I won't buy this again. Come on with the bottle dating!"

"Whenever I drink a DIPA I always seem to try and compare with Avery's Maharaja because it impressed me so much. This isn't like Maharaja in many ways but this is still a damn good beer. It's not overly complex but with what flavors it has it's such an enjoyable beer."

"Last time I had this Hop Stoopid by Lagunitas, I was a different type of beer drinker; the hops were almost too much for me to handle. Since then, I’ve described this brew as “just hoppy, nothing sweet, complicated, or intense about it – just lots of hops.” I’m going to retract that description from now on. The Lagunitas Hop Stoopid is hoppy, but far more complex than I had previously given it credit for."
""

""

""

"O-Great DIPA! Awesome piny citrus tastes. It was hard not to just chug the whole glass down at once. Lots of restraint needed. VERY drinkable! Not overly assertive/aggressive for me. Bring on some more!"
""
"O: Get this beer."
"The beer appears transparent and orange hued with a thick white head that coats the glass in lacing. The aroma brings some hop, floral, and pine notes, followed by a sweet malt body. The flavor delivers exactly what the aroma promised. Subtle spice adds a nice touch. A bit sweet, but not so much that it becomes cloying. Grapefruit and citrus flavors are quite nice as well. It took me a long time to get around to trying this beer, but I am glad I finally did. Very enjoyable. I look forward to having this again."
""
""
""
"O: Very pleased with this """easy to drink""" and well-balanced DIPA. Very clean and clear hops, citrusy aromas are inviting and the long, but not overpowering hop flavor create a nice finish and a nice dry mouth feel. I cannot wait to get some more of it and try it side by side with other, good DIPAs."
""
""""Veeery interesting; but kind of stoopid"""."
""
"The bitterness is certainly here in spades, but I was expecting a more jarring experience from the high IBU's. Definitely have it. I know I would gladly get Stoopid again."
""
""
"I love hops and understand the appeal of a beer with a ridiculous amount of hops. Love the 120 Minute offering for example. But this is just over the top. It has so much hops that it actually gets kinda skunky. Some people may like hops so much that this is tolerable, but not me."
"Tons of concentrated hop flavors: green onions, pine and fresh cut grass with some citrus sourness as well. Very thin malt base gives a dry cracker flavor to it. Even with the thin malt, base, this is a pretty well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils, with a good dose of carbonation."
""
""
""
"Gross brew from a great brewery."
"There's a slight bit of an intense bitterness that is mixed with a floralness, that isn't overbearing...but toes on the line."
""
"Overall this a great DIPA. Great value and even better flavor. I'm really upset that it's not readily available in my area. NEPA'd"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a pour! Terrific snow capped head, straw color, medium carbonation. Sticky lacing on the first sip, continues all the way until the final sip. Scents are of strong pine needles and pungent wicked grapefruit. Wow is this hoppy and bitter. Not much balance for a DIPA. Great brew for an extreme hop head, and although a really good beer, especially in scent and appearance but a bit too tilted toward the hops. One of the hoppiest beers I've ever had. Just not something I could deal with but a couple times a year."

"O- A great DIPA, hop oil works really well to create a strong, clean hop character, great flavor and value."

" Wow If you are into Hop forward brews than this one is for you! If not I would stay away. This is a good DIPA and even Better price value!"

"Hands down this DIPA is a hop head's dream come true and is a near perfect example of what this truly a American style of IPA should taste like. A punch to the taste buds! Sexy! haha"
""
""
""
""
"The taste is strong in citrus and hops. With so much hops, this beer is surprisingly balanced and drinkable. There is a slight aftertaste of alcohol as well. I feel like I could drink two or three of them, though a few of the 22oz bottles would put me on my ass for sure. This is definitely a beer that I would suggest trying at least once."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"YUM!"
""
"Overall - Great IPA from every aspect. The alcohol is a little bit too apparent, but still lets the flavors shine too. Compared to similarly priced beers this puts nearly all of them to shame. Great/subtle aroma and a hop profile that is truely impressive and complex."
""
"This has a high alcohol profile to it but this beer is up for the task of being aggressive without being overbearing. It's so rare to find Double IPA that isn't a hop bomb but this certainly fir that bill and it's rare that I find a Bomber that I can't wait to buy and down by myself once again. There's no doubt that this fit that bill and for anyone who loves Nugget Nectar, a SN big bottle, or any of the Green Flash brews, this should be on his or her must-try list. Highly recommended!"
""
"Drinkability- So after reading the label I see this is all hop oils/hop extracts. I think that probably explains the raw sort of hop bitterness that seems to be sort of one dimensional. Saying that though, the beer is still really tasty. I wish the booze was toned down a touch but otherwise I enjoyed the shit out of this beer. Definitely a great brew for $5!"

"Pours a wonderful gold color with a frothy head. It adheres perfectly to the side of the glass as it goes down. Aroma of caramel, apricot, and dried fruit. As I drink a mouthful, I can taste huge pineapple and grapefruit flavors. The forefront of the flavor so to speak, is sweet and citrus-y, while it has a dry finish of bitter piney hops. The overall mouthfeel is thick and creamy however. I expected a boozy taste but there was none. Fresh & Tasty!"

"This beer was very impressive, and especially at 3.99! This beer is such a great value and by far the best beer I've had from Lagunitas. Such a great balance of malt and hops and hop bitterness make this beer so incredibly drinkable. My only wish would be be that Lagunitas date their bottles."

"O: Bring it on."
"O: At 3.99 a Bomber this beer is absolutely unbeatable!!!"
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! And it moves on to a beer I should've had a long time ago, frankly. It pours a clear straw-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises dark greens, light pine, toffee, and some very light mint. The taste holds notes of greens, toffee, caramel, very light mint, and very light lime. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, this is a pretty solid DIPA, but it lacks a lot of the hop character I was expecting, both from the style and the name. Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty, but it falls short of great for me."
"I see random people pick up this beer but due to my disappointments with lagunitas in the past I avoided it. I picked up a bottle tonight and was pleasantly surprised for the msot part. It's a very straight-forward beer. A big hop hip in the beginning followed by a hay/grain/grass solid flavor that lasts through the finish. Very basic, but well-composed and would satisfy anyone looking for a quick DIPA fix."
"The mouth starts with a numbing carbonation. Sweetness follows and the hop flavor and end with a slight bitterness...hrm not a bad taste but average at best."
"This is the closest thing to Pliny that I've tasted. It does a great job of hiding its bitterness and ABV. This is a departure from Lagunitas' normal tendency, which is to punch you in the face with hops. I appreciate the subtlety in this beer and it shows that Lagunitas isn't a one trick pony. The nose is really the main act here. You get a complex, intriguing hop aroma that is also backed up by a hint of the farmhouse spiciness that's advertised on the bottle. I really appreciate this spicy characteristic, as it is the main thing that sets it apart from PtE. One of my favorite DIPAs, this is a cheaper alternative to Pliny that is just as good."
"O – Not very many of the Lagunitas offerings have let me down, and this one never does when I pick up a bottle at the local shop. And you can’t beat the price for this puppy. Say what you will and what you want, Lagunitas it’s a great brewery for what they charge"
"Overall-I like it, ive had it before and this is not my second or third time drinking it. Really good DIPA. Lagunitas did a good job. I find that the colder the beer the better it seems to hit the spot. Cheap price for a good beer as well."
"Solid, but a little rough around the edges. Slightly on the sweet side, with resinous raw hop oil and some pinecone notes. Goes just a little syrupy toward the middle, but the hops move back in at the finish and bat clean up. Comes off as being a little overdone without a corresponding depth to the flavor."
"This beer will scratch your double IPA itch, but just barely and not for long enough."
"O - My favorite DIPA"
"Very good IIPA. Wonderful aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. Not too bitter for 110+ IBU's."
"O - great beer. phantastically balanced. Well done."
"O: I'm definitely going back for this one. Love it. Solid DIPA"
"O/D- Very much enjoying this. It's complexity and slight booziness does not take away from it's drinkability. I think this one will be a staple in my beer drinking. And cheers to the price point!"
"HV"
"Overall a great beer. I'll definitely buy it again if I'm looking for a nice DIPA for a good price."
"Aroma is amazing. It is that of pineapple and orange. Appearance is deceiving--it is a simple golden with little to no head that dissipates quickly. Taste is delicious. Very floral, citrusy and tropical notes of hops. Palate has quick bitterness that is replaced by a resinous and smooth mouth-feel. Long citrusy resin finish."
"Overall: I am not sure that this one is regularly available from the Utah system, if it were and I knew it were fresh I would get this more often. This is solidly in the """Do not give to noobs""" category."
"anyhoo, if you want a double ipa that lacks the hoppiness of other beers in it's family, lacks the bitterness that goes with it, isn't dry, looks like bubbly urine, and tastes okay, run to the local packy and pick one of these bad rockets up. they might even have it on sale."
"The smell of this beer is terrific. As soon as I popped open the bottle I could smell the floral hops. It has a hint of herbs and sweetness. Appearance is golden in color, small white head. Taste is hoppy without being over powerful. A bit of sweet alcohol taste at the end. Very drinkable beer considering the IBU and ABV%. Not bad. Im starting to like Lagunitas alot."
"Holy sweet elixir! I usually stay away from DIPAs because they are often syrupy boozebombs with a hop character obscured by sickly sweet grossness. Not so with this one. The appearance is nothing special; amber with small head and little lacing. The smell and taste are nothing short of heavenly. Definite west coast hop flavor mingling with clover honey and a wonderful herbal quality reminiscent of fresh-cut grass (in a good way). Slick mouthfeel combined with barely noticeable alcohol make this one a winner. Drinkability is ridiculous. Reminds me of a less brutal Runiation. Highly recommended."
"Overall, wow this beer is impressive on-tap. I've had it bottled a couple of times but it was even better on tap. One of my favorite DIPAs out there."
"O: A solid West coast style IPA ("""hop bomb"""). I've had better, but this one is sure to please. Quality and craftsmanship are definitely there and it's quite flavorful while remaining drinkable. Probably not an IPA I would turn to on a regular basis, but definitely something I would recommend to those seeking to quench a hop-craving and no doubt a great example of the style (especially considering the location). Another solid one from Lagunitas. Cheers!"
"Good, vigorous carbonation, but not over the top. Light alcohol burn, but not too bad. Somewhat bitter and sour aftertaste."
"A pretty dang good hoppy beer."
"poured from a 22 oz bottle. Gorgeous crystal clear orange brew with a few fingers of white head. Aroma dominated by hops, of course - crisp citrus and resin flavors but a bit strange to my nose in places. Still very good. Flavor is excellent - it is remarkable that brew with this much hops loaded into it could still retain its balance - but it does. Really really hoppy flavor with a light malt backbone that somehow manages to hold the hoppiness in check. Tremendous hoppy finish that is surprisingly quick with no lingering aftertaste. Palate is good - light and crisp, not chewy. All round excellent brew."
"O: I can't believe how often I pass this up. At $4.99 a bottle it should be a crime to not buy this more often. This is absolutely one of the best Single or Double IPA's I've ever had. Do not pass this up, I would recommend buying this today if you are a hophead."
"O: A quality brew here. One that I would certainly reach for in the future. A solid """A""."
"The name is a bit intimidating for even a hop head. Once past that though this beer rocks. It is a well balanced beer for an IPA with such a high IBU count. Very nice body as you'd expect from an 8% beer. I'm hoping my next purchase will be a full keg of it if I can talk my wife into it.. maybe next spring after winter beer season is past!"
"O- ok but not something to buy again IMO"
"O - Really good! Unique for the style, not the overly aggressive bitter monster this style can be. Certainly hoppy, but the spicy, bready character really shines and makes it unique"
"O- Well balanced and easier to drink than you might expect, despite the high IBU and ABV (Might want to be careful with this one). I enjoyed it, would recommend it and will certainly buy it again."
"O: excellent beer, especially considering the price. $4.20 a bomber. perfect when I can't afford anything else."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I have ever had. Lagunitas knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to hppy beers."
"This was good, especially cold. As it warmed, flaws showed it a bit more. Good but not great."
"Overall, it's a good beer. It's an 8% ABV, so I wouldn't drink a bunch of 22 oz bottles if I had plans. Really good with pasta, fish or chicken. Enjoy."
"O – Not very many of the Lagunitas offerings have let me down, and this one never does when I pick up a bottle at the local shop. And you can’t beat the price for this puppy. Say what you will and what you want, Lagunitas it’s a great brewery for what they charge."
"There are some great citrus hops, lemon zest, and some grapefruit up front and some more prominent alcohol taste (8% a.b.v), but not a lot of malt to back it up. On my first try with this beer (I am writing of my third) I felt this way, but gave it another chance, at a warmer temperature, and it seemed to be much more balanced. With such a discrepancy I felt I had to try it a third time and unfortunately I am experiencing the same hop attack (which I absolutely love) with nothing to back it up. The small amount of malt I do get is light, sweet and delicious--a perfect compliment to the citrus and boozy qualities, but there’s not enough, leaving me with a strong, unbalanced forefront."
"O - Good. Hops do not disappoint. Not too complex but this works as a pro for the brew."
"O- its a good beer, but not what I was expecting. Seems to be a fairly easy drinking double Ipa though."
"O: overall, it is an ok beer. I expected more and was disappointed but it isn't a beer I would turn away if given to me."
"Overall: For the value, this DIPA is tough to beat. Another solid beer from Lagunitas."
"O - An amazing beer, an amazing IPA, an amazing bargain. I thought Lagunitas IPA was good, this stuff blows it out of the water. Lagunitas is known for bringing great quality beers at affordable prices, however I think we all need to realize they are more than a BA's go to bargain brewery. Lagunitas is a brewery on the verge of competing with world-class brews, and I can't wait to try more! 4 across the board for this one! Stay thirsty my friends!"
"overall, id like to try this beer again after i develop a better taste for DIPAs."
"Overall: The beer is aptly titled...It is all hops. I expected more depth and variety to the flavor. Not a dissappointing beer, though. Strong taste, good smell and feel equal a decent beer worth trying a few times."
"An overall pleasant beer to drink, the alcohol content sneaks up on you"
"O - I can't say enough about the bang for the buck this beer offers you. Try it!"
"Pours a crystal clear light to medium gold with a nice two finger soapy head that sticks around. The smell is mostly pine, tropical fruit, and noticeable grapefruit. Smells more sweet and fruity than it does bitter. The taste is magnificent. This is one of the most balanced DIPAs I have ever had. The bitterness is assertive, but balanced well by a nice malty foundation. The sweetness reminds me of brown sugar, and the hops give a nice pineapple and grapefruit taste. The mouthfeel is almost perfect. It is medium body with medium carbonation. Easily one of the most approachable DIPAs to date. Highly recommended to hop heads and those who are just starting to drink IPAs."
"O: Big west coast aroma, lets down a little in the flavor, a bit one dimensional and thin. Still a good overall DIPA, for me almost comes across as a strong IPA."
"O: an amazing DIPA, love the smell and taste. Perfect example in my opinion."
"Overall: I think Lagunitas really defines the DIPA style. A nice hop bite that lingers just enough for the sweet malt to take over. The ABV is well hidden here. A """must-try""" for DIPA fans. Well done Lagunitas, well done..."
"O: For promoting how many IBU's this baby has, it is surprisingly balanced, and a IPA lover's delight. Don't be stoopid, try this beer."
"You cant really beat this beer for price and taste. Very complex, a type of complexity that I normally don't expect in any type of IPA. A staple."
"Overall this is a great DIPA. My bottle wasn't as fresh as i would like it but if you have this fresh the hops are just amazing. You really got to drink these beers fresh and me living in Canada its kind of hard to get one super fresh. Maybe ill have to go to cali to taste some of these world class IPA's and DIPA's."
"Pours an amber/orange color, just how i like it. There was minimal head on this one, which dissipated pretty fast. It left behind a small amount of lace. Smells pretty hoppy, but also has a malty sweetness to it. Not overly bitter for 100+ IBU's, actually a lot less bitter than I expected, but really good. Sweetens up on the back-end. Has a nice amount of carbonation and no alcohol presence at all. I'd have to say this is one of the better DIPA's I have had. I'll be getting some more of this soon. Solid brew."
"Overall, I would say this is another solid offering from Lagunitas and is definitely not for the 'faint of hops'. For every other hop-head, this is a must-try."
"Lagunitas should win an award for producing such a quality beer for the price. What a steal!!!!"
"The hop flavor is quite enjoyable, and the beer is easy to drink given everything going on with it. It's a great beer, but a subtle metallic smell and taste really keep this one from going further...maybe I have an old bottle, couldn't find a date."
"O: A nice Double IPA. Very refreshing. Not huge on the earthy hoppiness, but it does have a decent kick to it."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink because the bitterness is not overpowering and although alcohol is noticeable in the taste for the most part it is masked."
"Had this on tap at Lagunitas... comes in a mason jar with a dog on it. Appearance- Very nice golden amber color with nice frothy white head on top. Smell- HOPS HOPS AND MORE HOPS-- very piney, citrusy, and floral. Taste- At first it's a little overwhelming with the hops.. but as you drink it your palate gets used to it. I love IPA's and this is a very strong good example of one. Go out and try it kids!!!"
"Overall: Is it the best double IPA no. However this beer is special because of it's availability , price, and quality. In this price range you are hard pressed to find another offering that touches this stuff. I have always really dug this beer and if you want to get someone into the swing of drinking Hop Bombs this is a good 101 Beer for them . It isn't over the top it is just solid and I think nearly anyone can appreciate what it has to offer even if it is a little STOOPID."
"Overall, this is a nicely crafted beer. It was very balanced, and not as """offensively""" hoppy as I normally like my double IPAs. It might not be my favorite, but definitely a very good beer, and worth giving a try."
"Pours deep somewhat hazy amber with a bubbly two finger head - very airy with good retention leaving lines of wispy lacing as it drops ever so slowly. Smells piny, oily, sweet from both hops (extract) and malt, and resinous. Tastes nice and clean with distinct sweetness up front with a grapefruit-like characteristic all taken over by oily piny bitter hops, the hops definitely shine over the malt, although the caramel is hinting in. Syrupy full bodied mouth feel, a bit prickly on the back of the tongue from the carbonation and finishes sticky."
"O- It's a worthy double ipa, I'd recommend it, but it's not the first one I'd recommend."
"O: Very well done ale. The Alcohol is not apparent at all..would definitley reccomend.."
"Hop Stoopid is of the best I've had from Lagunitas. The poured of this beer is a deep copper color with a thick white foamy head on top. The smell of the beer is a bomb of hop aromas, everything from pine to citrus and some earth in there too. The taste is strong with hop flavors that instantly dry the mouth out and leave you wanting another sip. The mouthfeel of this beer is oily and has a nice thickness to it. Overall this beer is a must try for any hop head. Definitely worth checking out."
"The reasonable cost for bomber format only makes it more enticing."
"D: maybe a little too sweet for a DIPA. more like an american strong or american barleywine. strong. not the best DIPA ive had."
"Yeah, a decent beer but ultimately pretty stoopid."
"O: good beer, but I believe it may be HYPE stoopid."
"Overall - A very good DIPA, and the bitter hops make you want to continue sipping to get just enough of that sweetness to offset the grapefruit peel and pine. Excellent if you do not like sweetness in your DIPA's. If you like a little more malt sweetness/carmel, go for their Maximus."
"o - enjoyable, but not a beer for the faint of heart. this one will rip your tastebuds off and stomp on them. but hey, some people like that sort of thing."
"Wow!"
"overall, a nice DIPA at a good price."
"O - This is one of my favorite IIPAs! The flavor profile is fabulous due to the balance Lagunitas managed to strike. I would definitely recommend this brew to everyone!"
"Well I have to say this was a very, very good DIPA. There are other ales I consider to be superior, but that being said, this ale has what it takes. Nothing overly complex, but delicious, and a very enjoyable drink. I think that the label stated 102 I.B.U.’s is a bit of a stretch but there are definitely a good amount of hops present. For me this would be “a session ale” (full confession, for me that means 64 oz. or less in an evening, of relatively high ABV beers). Lagunitas continues to impress me, mainly because I have located their better offerings."
"Big ass hop smell. Sweet gooey hops burst out. It's all floral, citrus, toffee, and maybe pine. Flavor delivers all that in the aroma with a wallop. I like it. Those hops have free reign and thankfully the malt does its supporting role well by not being overly sweet or toffee like (some scorched sugar smell present). There’s a lingering biting bitterness that's testament to the amount of hops in here.  Body manages to be light enough but it does have some weight to it. Definitely one glass is good! It's hop-load is fatiguing. Pretty good DIPA here."
"O: Great DIPA!!! Not too sweet and a good level of hops. Very satisfied with this beer. I like it more than their ipa. Would defiantly buy again."
"Great west coast style with big emphasis on hop flavors."
"O - Love, love this beer. Citrus and pine throughout with enough malt backbone to not scare away the non hop-heads. The 102 IBU's and 8% alcohol are not overbearing at all. Wonderful beer from one of the west coast's best."
"Great beer! I rank this up there with Pliny, Sculpin, and Hoptimum."
"Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had. I can't think of any reason to mark it down."
"$4.50 per bomber at Total Wine & More. This is probably the best beer per $ I have had yet. Up there with Pliny the Elder & Double Jack for sure!"
"O: This is a really nice beer especially when you factor price into the equation. If available in Nashville, I'd buy this regularly."
"Overall, this is a solid IPA, and hop lovers will surely rejoice at its Brobdingnagian bitterness, but it is also a good beer in its own right. Well worth trying."
"All at 8% alcohol? Awesome."
"O - Overall, I like this beer a lot. Not up there with Pliny or Hopslam but it's certainly the best value of any DIPA out there."
"O: This is quite good. I've not had anything bad from lagunitas yet, so this impulse purchase is definitely a good one."
"Decent double IPA, even if I've had much better. At this price I wouldn't buy it again unless I could verify that it was extremely fresh. The bottle doesn't list a date of any kind and it was sitting on the shelf unrefrigerated, so I suspect this probably isn't in the greatest of shape. Premier Wine and Spirits has such a well-chosen beer selection you'd think they would extend their efforts to include refrigeration for the hoppy brews at least."
"Overall: It’s a decent DIPA with no single memorable quality."
"This DIPA packs a ton of flavor, and I enjoy the fact that it does so without laying on the malt too thickly. I wish there was a bit more complexity to the hop signature--perhaps a bit more citrus in the mix. And I really wish Lagunitas would put a freshness date on these bombers. But, overall, this is a beer with very nice balance that should please any fan of the style."
"Thanks to schmittymack for sharing a can of this one at his place a couple weeks back. Poured a nice amber color with a light beige head. Aromas of earthy hops, caramel and biscuit. On the palate, this on is light to medium bodied, with sweet malt, caramel and moderate hops."
"This pours a nice copper color with a minimal white head which quickly dissipates away but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is wonderful, full of citrus hops, I get a wave of grapefruit, a little alcohol, a little floral and a hit of caramel malts, I'm looking forward to this one. Feel is medium to light with nice carbonation and pine resin. The initial taste is bitter hops and with a sweet caramel malt, on the way down I get a wave of pine hops, some malty sweetness, a little alcohol warmth followed by a nice grapefruit bitter lingering after flavor. Overall a very nice IIPA, it has the sweetness but it the high IBU makes up for that and you're left with plenty of hoppy goodness, this is a very nice IIPA, one of the better ones I've tried, this is way better than the Maximus, I wish I could find this in 6 packs, I'd get it far more frequent."
"O: Beer like this doesn’t come around very often. With every sip, I’m reminded of that perfect DIPA, Pliny the Elder, more and more. The balance and complexity that I get from this beer makes me proud to be a craft drinker in this country – only in America will you see a brewer go so deep with hop extract. An admirable offering from Lagunitas, and quite possibly the world’s best hop-forward beer made with extracts."
"Overall / Drinkability: A very tasty brew - and dangerous. The ABV is well hidden and I could easily see myself having another glass. If this is what hop extracts can yield in a DIPA, I think I like the extracts quite a bit. I can drink it by itself, and I could have it with a meal - but in this case I think the beer clashed a bit with the meal. I know some swear that spices and hops go together, but in the case of red beans and rice spiced up with Frank's hot sauce, it did not go well together. Oh well - not every beer pairing can go well. Still, a good beer and I can see why this beer is as highly rated as it is. Not just for hopheads - although the more hoppy you like your beer the more you'll like this beer."
"The worst Double/Imperial IPA I've ever had? No. Not even close. But not pleasant, either."
"Good beer but not my favorite of the style. I prefer a little bit more balance in the palate w/o so much bitterness but others may not mind quite as much. I really like to taste what I"""m smelling though!"
"This is a great beer, would buy again however if given the choice of some other DIPAs this would fall on the list a bit."
"Pours a medium amber, a finger of stone colored foam, decent retention and minimal lacing. Smells is big caramel and toffee malt up front, some grass and earth and spice, with some tropical fruit (mango) and apple in the background. Lots of caramel and malt and pine come through on the palate, some secondary tropical fruit, mild bitterness but pretty juicy on the finish. Carbonation is medium with a nice bite, body is medium and somewhat sticky. I have to say, this goes down easy. Overall, this is a good IPA, leaning heavily towards the malty side, that I wouldn't mind drinking regularly."
"Smells somewhat sweet, spicy, with heavy hop aroma. I almost sense some fruitcake in there, but mostly it is hops, hops, and more hops...piney and a bit citrusy. Bitter, resinous stick to your tongue hops hit you on the first taste, refreshing and I want more. Fairly well balanced, considering. A nice thickish mouthfeel. I think this is a quite well-balanced beer that I enjoy a great deal."
"O - Overall, this is a great DIPA. While it's not necessarily in my top 3 or 5 for the style, this is a very affordable (around $4.99 for a bomber where I live) and widely available beer. Very easy go-to DIPA when there's nothing else available or you don't want to break the bank on a more expensive bomber IMHO."
"O: A very nice Imperial IPA. What really stands out to me is the taste, and I plan on picking this up any chance I get."
"O - West Coast IPA all the way."
"Overall- I really like this one. One of the better beers in the DIPA catagory and at the price its a must have, over and over again."
"Wow, what a hop smack. Poured lively into my glass and watched the head quickly rise to about two fingers. Mucho lacing down the glass, as should be. Smell is huge pine, grass and citrus. The first taste sends waves through my taste buds, and an amazement through my brain from the intense hop bitterness. No exageration, I could still taste the bitterness 10-15 minutes after my glass was empty. Mouthfeel was very good, a toal immersion into the Imperial IPA world. Love it, and will be back again, and again."
"I've been drinking this for several years now and, by far, this is the best bargain you can get in the double IPA segment. I'll put this up against anything, pliny, maharaja, etc. and it will hold up nicely. Best of all, I can get this for 4.50 per bomber. Love it."
"Overall - A decent DIPA, not outstanding by any means, but Lagunitas does a decent job of capturing the style."
"Was a little put off by the name but finally tried it. I have had Pliny often and regularly and my first thought when tasting this was 'wow this tastes like pliny'. As I savored the bomber I only became more and more impressed. This shit is a rival to the best of the American iipas. Hops, smoothness, sweet malt, abv are all where they should be."
"This is a fantastic imperial ipa. When fresh I easily put it up there with any I've ever had.The smell is a citrus/pine blast. The taste is perfectly balanced with grapefruit, pine, a little resin, a slight hint of carmel and a dry bitter finish. Sooo good. I had the honor of having this on draft at a perfect temperature (a little warmer than most) at toronado a few months back and was blown away. In my opinion every bit as good as pliny. I love this beer."
"O: Wow, I've had this many times, but it's been a couple years since last time. I got lucky this one was so fresh. This beer is fantastic and IMO can be placed in the same flavor profile as Pliny the Elder and Alpine's Duet. Really a nice beer."
"This is a great hoppy beer. Intense aromas as soon as you start to pour into the glass. Aroma is more piney and woody than citrusy, but has a subtle sweet undertone to it. Pours a beautiful almost bourbon color, very clean thanks to the use of hop extracts. The bitterness of the first sip will certainly wake you and your tastebuds up. That bitterness is profound and lingering, but not overpowering or uncomfortable. There is a subtle sweetness that comes through mid-mouth to help balance out the intensity. The hoppy, bitter flavors linger nicely on the tongue and back of the mouth, allowing you to enjoy this beer over an extended period of time."
"This beer is not underrated..but it is undiscovered. You can't get Pliny easily in Texas and this beer make me not care."
"Poured a very nice honey colour with a bright white head, and had excellent lacing throughout the drink. The nose was very complex: big citrus hops, tropical fruit, malt, and pine. The taste was also superb: big grapefruit, juniper, apricot/nectarine, malty sweetness, and a very floral after taste. Delicious beer."
"Cheers..."
"Overall: One of my favorite DIPAS, and a hard one to beat for the price (4.49 for the bomber)."
"One of the best IIPA's I've ever had. Definitely well done and something I will seek out again!"
"Overall - A suitable stand-in for pliny, especially when fresh. This bottle was 2 months old and starting to lose some of its umph."
"I am nuts about citrus hop flavors and Hop Stoopid provides with exuberance. This just became my favorite DIPA."
"The taste is awesome. A nice pine, citrus blend. Grapefruit and orange with a pretty sweet back ground. This is ranked pretty bitter on the label, but it is really a pleasant beer to drink. Way too easy to drink actually. The mouth feel is great with carbonation and smoothness all blended into one. I really like this beer. I hope it is available next time I go back to Illinois. This one is on my staple list. I thought I saw it in 6 packs."
"The beer is full-bodied and viscous. A great brew."
"Overall a decent IPA. The rich golden color looked good in my glass, as did the head which didn't cling to the glass too much. Got a nice citrus/floral aroma that I rather enjoyed before tasting it. The first taste definitely hit me with almost an orange hint and followed with a nice piney aftertaste which lingered for a bit and was quite pleasant. Not quite as strong as I was expecting but at the same time not too subtle either. It is kind of a nice spot in the middle, definitely an IPA I would buy again and enjoy."
"O- Since surly Abrasive isn't available local, this will be my go-to budget IIPA. Between my brother and I, we are keeping lagunitas in Missouri. I love this beer."
"Definitely not my favorite DIPA, but hard to beat for the price. A good hoppy beer if you're not too interested in bitterness, and you prefer citrus and caramel to be the dominant flavors, not so much pine or tropical fruits."
"Hop stoopid pours an electric yellow color and settles a translucent copper. One finger of a tannish white color. A thin layer of oily legs sticks when swirled. The nose seems faded. Light citrus and pine are shadowed beneath a sweet smelling malt. The taste is a bit better thankfully. Quite bitter upfront with a bit of hops. The malt is caramel malt is sweet and bready. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, medium bodied and smooth. Overall, tasty and drinkable tho having this in the past and enjoying it much more, I think I got an old bottle. This will be revisited for sure."
"A delightfully hoppy experience. The medium froth, the sweet smell, the hopppy bite that resembles biting a pine needle between your front teeth and the smooth finish all combined to make this a wonderfull beer. There is a slight alcohol burn but it does not detract from the overall enjoyment."
"O: Fairly balanced ipa. Little bitterness in finish, which is refreshing."
"Poured almost the entire bomber into my Sam Smith pint glass. The appearance is glorious with the beer being a deep amber color but you can see through the glass. The head foams up and settles quickly leaving a thin layer covering the surface. The smell is comparable to a sweet pineapple mixed with a pine tree. The taste is similar and for being 102 I.B.U's this is quite a drinkable ale. As it warms up the melon characteristics are really prominent. Overall this is a fantastic double IPA, so good that I almost drank my stash before getting around to reviewing one."
"Opinion: I am surprised to report that I have really enjoyed this beer. Not like it will turn me into a hop-head or anything as I wouldn't do this to my palate on a regular basis, but for what this beer is and in the style it is in, I can say that this is one of the best that I have ever had. I like Hercules and such because of the balance, and this beer somehow does the same thing. It doesn't finish malty, but finishes balanced and drinkable. I must say that I am impressed that they are able to """mask""" >100 IBUs into a beer that is still palatable. Obviously their final additions of hops are also very liberal due to the obvious oils in the aroma...but this beer pulls it off well. If I were to pick up a DIPA, this would be one of the first on my list. Definitely in my top 10 no doubt."
"O: A bitter double IPA. I like mine with more balance. This is quite nice fresh, if big hop bombs with little to no backbone are your thing."
"Overall, not very good. I will stick with the other Lagunitas."
"22 oz poured into a snifter. Nice head that dissipates fairly quickly. When swirled, it laces nicely and reveals good pine and citrus hop characters in the nose. Tastes like it smells, other than being a tad sweeter on the tongue than the nose. Nice bitterness with no lingering """bad taste""". Medium mouth feel with tingly carbonation. I'm having this with a nice salty sausage pizza, and they compliment each other quite well. As a gin drinker, I'm very partial to IPAs, and this one is really good."
"O: I had higher hopes being a LaGunitas beer. Being a 'fan,' was a little let down 'they' didn't throw down the 'goods' being as it's a double IPA. Bottom line, I'm glad I got a 22.oz instead of a 6 pk."
"SCRUMPTIOUS HOP FEST, MUST TRY!"
"O-this is a great IPA. its possible that for the price per volume, there is no better. its well balanced and drinkable. i can't believe how smooth it is for such a strong flavor. it is actually difficult to put this glass down and to savor it. a bomber will disappear rather quickly."
"nothing about the feel was annoying or really that harsh to be honest i was expecting more from a 102 ibu beer but i did enjoy is very much"
"O: overall, this is a great offering.old to have finally tried it"
"Decent 1 finger head on pour. Body is a nice shade of amber if not a bit on the light side. Could use a little more color. Smell is very sweet juicy pineapple. Lots of tropical notes in the nose. Smells outstanding! Nice clean bitterness upon tasting with plenty of tropical fruity notes. Only real downside is that the taste overall, however good it is, is a bit weak. Just seems to need a bit more oopmh. Carbonation is a bit thin and watery as well. Maybe that is what is missing? Or maybe a little of both. Overall it is a good DIPA but just not really great."
"Overall I must get a fresh batch of this and start over with an edit. I have had this many times in the past and have enjoyed it tremendously. Not this one. Not Lagunitas' fault. Just an old batch. IMO."
"The more I drink the more I am turned off by double IPAs. I love and I mean love hops, but I don’t need this much malt. Odds are this is amazing a week after bottling, but even if this is fairly fresh (and it might be) any age on most double IPAs allows the malt to take over and it has given to much way to the malt. Still an excellent beer and as I understand it, priced well for the style."
"Aroma is hoppy and slightly peppery. Fresh and juicy hops for the most part but it had this weird twang. Tastes like gubna but much milder with the onion hops. Feel is moderate and tingly. Kinda dissapointing. I hate onion hops. Who wants onion in their beer. I will stick to lil sumpin sumpin wild."
"I remember the first time I had this beer I was absolutely blown away by the hop content. Maybe I've gotten used to it or maybe this bottle has been on the shelf for a few weeks, but in my opinion, Hop Stoopid is an extremely well balanced DIPA. Cheers"
"Overall: This is a very drinkable DIPA. Goes down smoothly and you can't recognize the 8% ABV. I would recommend this to anyone and share it with people too. Lagunitas has once again done a good job and at a very reasonable price for DIPA's at $5. Great beer at a bargain price."
"o: nice DIPA. flavorful at 8% and with a wonderful nose. I found the nose to be the highlight of this beer and when joined in the taste the citrus really pops. I'm okay with the intensity of the bitterness, but the lingering bitter that comes back strong at the end takes away from the nice finish that was sweet and nice. It is like a good, but long movie that just doesn't know when to end (I'm looking at you LOTR)"
"Crystal clear and golden in color, with a small head, this beer is certainly attractive. The aroma is rich with fruit (apricot), mingled with lots of herbal and earthy hops. Some fresh-hop leafy smells are present as well. Intensely bitter and resiny hop flavor...some malt. Tongue numbing hop intensity. Alcohol warming. This beer has a lot going on. The hops are the core of the brew, however. Full body, with a little spritziness. Nice beer."
""""There's at least two parties in my mouth""" and """I can see a nap in my future""" were two things I remember being uttered the first time I tried Hop Stoopid. I also once encouraged a friend to smell it and his response was: """Smelling it hurts my eyes""". All these are appropriate statements about a beer that is stoopidly bitter and hoppy. And really stoopidly enjoyable."
"O - This beer is much better then some of the overhyped, limited release DIPA's I've had lately. Overlooked by me until now, this goes on my regular rotation list."
"Gold pour with a frothy, 1 finger, white head and good lacing. Loads of sweet, bright, citrus and bubblegum esters in the aroma with some resinous pine notes and toffee malt. More fresh wet hops in the flavor with lots of grapefruit and pine and a big caramel malt background. Sticky medium body with enough carbonation to wash down all those hop oils. Great stuff. Tastes a lot like a fresh Hopslam."
"Overall If you enjoy IPA's I would recommend this beer. It gives you exactly what you expect from a IPA with a IBU count above 100. Especially for the price this beer is worth a try or two."
"a solid brew. and seeing as its getting hard to appreciate one of the some affirmed american craft beer styles... i have to say this is very drinkable. very nice and hoppy pineapple and lace of sticky honey pollen malty backbone. well balanced and goes down like water with korean food. with a nice tad sweet ender. a bit of earthy malt notes. not boozy with a frothy feel."
"O: A great double IPA that brings tons of sweetness without tasting like a malt sandwich. I usually prefer dry IPA's, but this one fits the bill without being dry at all because the malt doesn't overpower the hoppy goodness."
"The 8 percent is seriously not even noted and I'm sure the vicious hop flavor just covers this up unbelievably well. This is most definitely the cheapest and best 22 oz bomber of quality IPA I've ever had. This seriously has the hop flavor and quality of high end 12 dollar bottles. Its awesome how the flavor is more of a sweet bitterness rather than a dry sharp bitterness which is why some people might question the 102 IBU's. I also get some piney hop notes as well on the taste as it warms more. I really can't say enough good things about this beer. A plus all the way around."
"Despite my griping, I still enjoyed this beer and would gladly drink it again. While I would not brand it a """punch you in the tongue""" DIPA, I could see this as a decent DIPA for pairing with foods."
"Overall: A very solid version of a DIPA. A little more bready than the others I've tried."
"(D)- A solid IPA that fits the style very well. Pretty straightforward, but it hits all the spots when I look for a good IPA. And a great bang for your buck in a sea of expensive DIPA's."
"Overall- “102 I.B.U 4 U” a great label statement that very much describes this beer in a nutshell, a very bitter, hopped up double IPA that takes no prisoners. As I said before in my review a definite hophead’s dream come true. A very solid offering that rivals some of the other great DIPA’s that I have tried in the past. For the price point I would definitely seek this one out again, well worth the $5 to try this one."
"Overall this beer reminds of an extreme Great Laker Burning River. I get this strange grape flavor from them which I don't care for in an IPA. Pretty disappointed with this beer considering I really like their Maximus DIPA."
"O: Always having been a fan of Lagunitas a Lil Sumpin', I had high expectations for this brew. It's def fair to say it passed my test. Great bang for the buck and I'd definitely get it again."
"Overall: This beer rocks. Fantastically hopped and satisfyingly balanced."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. This beer pours a nice golden/amber color with a thin creamy head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice lacing. The nose is well balanced with a nice up front crispness. Hop Stoopid has the smooth bitterness that is characteristic from highly hopped imperial IPAs, but I feel it lacks the floral notes on the finish that would come from using fresh hops over the extract. Mouth feel is silky smooth with almost no hint of alcoholo. Overall I would rate this as a very good experiment by Lagunita's into the Imperial/Double IPA realm. Their use of hop extract is impressive in it's execution and I feel that late time wet hopping just prior to fermentation would give this beer an exceptional characteristic that would push it into greatness."
"Awesome."
"O-- IBU's do creep up on me halfway through on this but really well crafted as not massive up front. ABV is almost nonexistent in this. Get halfway through the first and start craving a second. That is a good sign."
"Pours a clear, slightly crimson golden color with a nice big white head. Pine and resin hop comes strongly off the nose with a nice malt balance. Smells really nice actually. The taste is a sweet malt balance to those same pine and resin hops. The original bite of the pine hops comes off almost fruity, but also with a hint of booze. Not as sweet as some DIPAs, which is welcome. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and some residual sweetness that hangs out on the tongue. Overall is a 5.0 with the bump because it is a $4 bomber. I mean, $4, seriously? This is not nearly the best IIPA I've ever had, but it has really nice pine flavor, is $4 and is much better than the attempts of a ton of different breweries attempt to make a decent IIPA."
"O: This is a very, very good DIPA. Flavors are wonderful, really great stuff. Another one to revisit often. Yum!"
"Overall: Very nice, bitter, hoppy, sweet, complex and well played. and a decent ABV."
"OA: Well balance yet still intricate and interesting, a very nice brew."
"Final Notes: One heck of a Double IPA. It's hoppy, malty, smooth, and balanced. This is just begging to be paired against some spicy food. Give it a try!"
"This one is better than I was anticipating. A nice change of pace from the PtE I've been sucking down recently like it's running out of stock."
"O: Very inspired by these less than fresh results... will have to seek out and try again."
"I've always been a fan of Hop Stoopid, and am a huge fan of just about anything Lagunitas puts out. This beer does not try to be anything other than what it is - a massive hop bomb of bitter. If you like a good, uncomplicated DIPA, definitely give this a try."
"O - Awesome double IPA. This ranks up there with the best. Very well balanced and fresh."
"O: Hop Stoopid, """for those mornings when you have to cut right to the chase""" -Lagunitas. Exactly what I need when feel like getting a little stupid."
"D-Overall this was a great representation to DIPA. Hoppiness all the way through. Wish it had alittle more complexity but overall a nice beer."
"O: This is an exceptional DIPA. Whether I'm in California or the Midwest, it is always available somewhere at a very fair price. Regardless of its availability and price, I would go far out of my way to continue to obtain this brew. The crispness and fresh hoppy flavor of Hop Stoopid is addicting. This is a beer experience that shouldn't be passed up."
"As such, it's hard to describe this as a beer that goes down smooth, but it is certainly interesting and well, in my book, that's more than half the battle."
"The taste is a bit smoother and more mellow than the nose. I wish it was more abrasive and hoppy. The taste is still smooth and very fruity. Maybe I want some more pine to balance? The mouthfeel is a bit thin, butthat's the way I like my DIPAs. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. This would be one heck of a good, cheap beer to kick off a night of drinking with."
"I'm actually really surprised at how drinkable this beer is for the IBU's. It's a DIPA indeed, but it isn't abrasively bitter, nor is it excessively malty. It's hops forward, without being overbearing."
"O: Once again, the Lagunitas Brewing Company has out done itself! This is a great hoppy beer, and sold at a great price! I bought my 22oz for around $3.50"
"Overall, this is a great beer for the hops lover. Personally could use a little more of the hop bitterness from this one, but it is still an awesome beer."
"Very drinkable. There is a little bit of a syrupy finish, but mostly not cloying in the mouth. Alcohol is buried and hard to notice. A great beer."
"Can sense the alcohol half-way through but no warming feeling - not bad!"
"Overall, an incredible beer I could session all day. Or until I passed out. The label speaks of hop extraction and it totally makes sense. Reminds of smelling a Citra hop pellet. Well done."
"Super! Near close to perfection for a IPA that you'd want to have multiple of in sitting. Make no mistake this is beer for hopheads, and one could argue it tends to be one-dimensional. But its a dimension I love. Highly recommend."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sharp bite of carbonation at the beginning of each sip. Seems to be slightly lighter than other DIPA's, but definitely goes down easily. Overall, this is a great brew. Something that is enjoyable to drink and needs to have time spent on each bottle. Not a bad price for a bomber either..."
"D- Quite a hoppy brew. Decent malt backing, not too heavy. I'm not sure I could handle more than a single bomber of this."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a orangish gold color and produced a really nice white creamy head. Head retention was excellent and left an outstanding amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma was great, it was filled with pine, citrus and apricot. This beer is medium in body. The taste of the beer was consistent with the aroma, it was full of hoppy piney bitterness, and citrusy. This beer was very well done, no over the top aftertaste and not to dry of a finish. Very Very Good example of an Imperial IPA. I will be buying this again very soon!"
"Overall: This is a great example of an Imperial IPA. Damn, I just wish I bought another one, or two or three..."
"One of my favorite IPAs around"
"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. Pours a bright, crystal clear amber with moderate carbonation and one finger of lumpy foam. Decent lacing. Nose is a lot of mango and maybe a hit of citrus. The hops and malt meld together quite well here, although it leans a bit towards the sweeter side. Great mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on and the texture is nice and light. Easy to drink. Very bitter on the palate with more grapefruit than mango. The malt swoops in for a quick rescue from what would almost certainly be a brutally bitter finish. Still, nice, resiny hops outlast everything else and wreak havoc on the taste buds. They aren't heavy though. They walk that fine line where they are big enough to make a hop head smile and light enough for that same hop head to order two more rounds."
"O- very pleased with this beer. I was surprised that is was reasonably drinkable with great hop aromas. I will definitely be buying this again."
"(22oz. bottle) Pours clean, clear gold appearance. Nose is very powerful. Grapefruity and hoppy. Strong citrus and nice (bitter) hops go back and forth. The beer packs a nice punch early, but fades quickly. The aftertaste, however, does last a long time."
"DELISH!! And...this is the cheapest bomber at most stores I go to. I just drank a bomber of Hop Czar from Bridgeport Brewing and it was twice the price of this one, though the Hop Stoopid rating is higher. Pickit up!"
"Drinkability: This is a harsh beer. It screams at a high decibel with bitterness. I prefer my IPAs to be on the citrus/tropical side of the spectrum, so this isn't a favorite of mine. However, for just over $4 for the bottle, it's an easy beer to drink for sure."
"O - For the price, I think this is a fantastic deal for a DIPA that is very drinkable. New to the shelves in the NH area and will certainly be a regular fixture in my fridge."
"A nice orange with a small off white head. The aroma is clover honey, pine resin and very boozy. Very earthy and fresh. The taste is boozy honey. This is quite sweet and why 102 IBU's were needed to come close to balancing it out. The mouthfeel is sweet and syrupy. The cabonation level is good and there is a dryness and mild bitterness on the finish. This is an evening sipper and more of a barley wine."
"Overall: Really good beer that I will definitely recommend and come back to. Exceeded my expectations because I tried Maximus and didn't like it too much."
"D: very. I poured it too cold, but it got much better as it warmed"
"Very good DIPA, and a good value in the bomber format category."
"I used to enjoy this beer a little bit more in my earlier craft beer days, but now I find the bitterness to linger for quite some time and I have a problem with that since it blocks other flavors. The drinkability is not where I would like it to be and the extreme piney bitterness is definitely a major factor. I couldn't taste anything right for about 2 hours after drinking this beer. But I finished it, and enjoyed it so that's what really matters."
"At $4.50 for a 22oz, its decent value but I'd much rather spend a little more coin and get something I'd truly enjoy drinking. Some other in the same price range I've enjoyed more."
"No real notice of the alcohol with a medium to light mouthfeel. A delight for hop heads. Will definitely have this again."
"Good carbonation. Very smooth for 102 IBUs. Creamy and biting. I will seek this one out again."
"Would love to see this in six packs...i can dream can't I? Availability and price make this one a real winner."
"The beer pours a crystal clear orange, amber color with a finger of white foam which dissipates alsost immediately. No lacing to speak of. The aroma reaches my nostrils while I'm still pouring, and it is like manna to my tired soul. The scent of lupulin permeates my olfactory bulb, imbuing me with a sense of peace and relaxation. Big citrus notes, and piney goodness dominate. The bottle promises an amazing 102 IBUs, so I'm not surprised at the lack of much malt presence. Taste follows the nose with an initial onslaught of wonderful hoppy bitterness. Citrus and pine intermingle in a bitter dance across my palate. There is enough malt to support the 8% ABV, but the focus is on bitterness here, and bitter it is! The finish is...(wait for it)... bitter! and dry. Very nice! Just as a big west coast IPA should be! Cheers!"
" I have no complaints about the mouthfeel. It's full bodied. with terrific balance. The backing malts make the extreme malts palatable. Lagunitas never disappoints for providing sheer tasting pleasure. In the end I think this is pretty heavy duty stuff. A great showcase beer for proving the talent of this brewery but probably not my go to double IPA. I would definitely recommend it be tasted in small doses and be contrasted with other DIPA's to show the variety that this style comes in."
"Mouthfeel is full yet quite sticky and resiny, too much so for my liking. Overall this is just not impressive and quite boring. With so many other more balanced DIPAs out there I just can't get recommend this."
"Hop Stoopid pours hazy light orange with 1 ½ fingers of chunky head and some moderate lacing. The smell is heavy hops, sugar and malt. The taste is really tolerable and citrusy, but as it warms its gains thickness and tastes a lot like honey. For being an 8% ABV, it does have a nice balance and a crisp bite. However, this is pretty heavy and leaves that sour/cereal aftertaste that is often indicative of the high percentage IPAs."
"Surprisingly drinkable, I was shocked how balanced this was. Solid beer."
"I truly enjoyed every sip of this beer. Carbonation level remained from start to finish. Bitterness does hit initially then fades to a very pleasant savor. This is definitely one of my go to beers"
"O- Overall this is great stuff, it cost me 4.50 for a bomber, its delicious and its always abundant, even here in NY. It's a shame this beer doesn't get as much love as the """limted /hype""" DIPA's, because its just as good as some of those i've had."
"Pours deep amber orange, and a small off white head that dissipates slowly, leaving nice layers down the glass. To the nose it has nice bitter floral hops, pine and some citrus. First taste is a bite of resinous hops, then some sweet malt to smooth things out, and a hop bite that then lingers on the palate. I have been drinking some damn good 2IPA's lately, and this is one of them."
"Hop Stoopid is a great beer at a great value. If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor, you have nothing to lose. Recommended."
"O - Nice beer. Easy to drink. Good, solid beer."
"M - silk. Very full..."
"This particular brew was poured into a snifter. It is an amber pour with approximately 1/4 inch of quickly fading head with minimal lacing. It has an aroma of hops, flowers, and slightly grassy. It tastes dry, very hoppy, with a hint of lemons, and again, very flowery. A good amount of bitterness is detected. This is a very tasty IPA."
"O: A great freakin IPA. This is one of the ones that I miss the most living in New Zealand!"
"A very, very distinct ADIPA."
"Name says it all. It pours into a glass like other beers, and it smells like pine trees. """Bitter, bitter every where. Lots of drops to drink.""" Malt is in there I assume, but trying to find it would be stoopid. It's the hops, stoopid. Is this like """ a million hopped?""" You know, like """triple hopped x 333,333.33.""""
"Overall-If you look at the overall picture this beer is awesome. In every aspect it is close to perfect, but need to leave some room for other IIPAs i've yet to try. It's 3.99 for 22oz and is widely available for a top notch IIPA. If this beer stayed fresh for a longer period of time I would buy this beer everytime i could. I could drink 44 oz a day of Hop Stoopid and be overly satisfied. Still not sure how Lagunitas does it with these cheap, top of the line bombers. Thanks to Lagunitas bombers that are over 4.99 just seem expensive."
"o: I think the balancing maltiness is what makes this beer a winner. the hops are expected and obvious with a name like """Hop Stoopid""" and coming from Lagunitas, but the malt really comes through perfectly and makes me want to keep drinking this again and again."
"O- I have found that I prefer DIPA's with a good deal of malts. I am not much a fan of the overly sweet and bitter doubles, like Pliny the Elder for instance. This beer ranks right up there with Dogfish 90 Minute as my favorite DIPA's. Great beer."
"D- Great beer it you want a hoppy beer with none of that """balance""" stuff. Especially for the price for the bomber it is a very good beer and I am surprised it has taken me thing long to find it"
"I drink this beer fairly often. Lovers of hop flavor rejoice. This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart, or really anyone who is not already an IPA lover. Double IPA is truly my favorite style and I find it a little overwhelming, but I keep coming back to it if I ever have the taste for Centennial hops. Cheers!"
"Ending notes: Overall, another fine presentation by Lagunitas. Well done."
"Given that grapefruit is one of my favorite foods, I had NO problem whatsoever making the most of this one. I kept sticking my nose in the glass; couldn't get enough of the citrus, and then you taste it and it just keeps on coming. A really nice beer. Great coloration, beautiful head and excellent drinkability. Had a pucker for me, with a wonderful acidity that ran right down the middle of my tongue. Too bad I had to enjoy it while watching the Syracuse Orangemen lose to Marquette..."
"Pours a translucent amber with a sizable head considering the high ABV. Moderate lacing. Nose is all grapefruit and ripe orange, the juice and the peels. Taste is surprisingly balanced between puckering hop bitterness and a sturdy malt backbone that comes right up through the middle. Aftertaste is lingering grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full enough for the style. Another solid Lagunitas brew."
"Overall, pretty good, but not a standout. The taste is simply too muted and unexciting. Nothing unpleasant about it, just not something that I will be actively seeking out again."
"D - easily drinkable. Not my fave but will drink again for sure."
" really nothing special with this one. but good all the way around."
"Not likely to revisit this one. I've had better from Lagunitas for sure."
"Poured this into a tulip glass. Color was copper. Head was thick, white, and healthy. Smelled like fresh flowers, taste had citrus and pine notes, sort of like marijuana, which I always get when I drink the Lagunitas IPA. Very little alcohol flavor to note, bitter finish where the malt made its presence known. I really loved this beer, and it's one of the better Double IPA's I've sampled to date."
"O - Overall, I will say I expected more from this beer."
"Very impressed with this one. Not amazing but solid all the way through."
"This surprised me. I had this on tap and never reviewed it and I do not remember liking it this much. Ruby pour, fluffy head, some stick on the glass. Very fragrant with super floral notes, I mean flowers! Apricot and pineapple up front, hops comes in later but does not take over. A pleasant bitterness at the end. Pine resins are here as well. A bit sticky but an easy drinking 8%."
"This is a very drinkable DIPA."
"Not quite to the level of the super double ipas but very good"
"D- This one sparked my love of grapefruit notes in my beer so it's about time I got around to reviewing it. All around a bit milder than I remember. The malt backbone is light and sweet which makes for the perfect balance to the grapefruit/citrus hop flavors. Not much else to say...I love it."
"Pours a super clear apple juice color with a nice 2 inch stark white head that fades to a small frothy cap. Bubbly ring lacing on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest hops, grapefruit, and pineapple juice. Very fruity and juicy smelling. Taste starts with grapefruit juice hops, pineapple juice, and a sweet malt backbone. Very refreshing and delicious. A very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation levels but this has a somewhat medium body. A bit thick and creamy but not too much. Exceptionally easy to drink. Great smell and great taste all around. One of my go to DIPAs."
"D: Nice hoppy ale that I really enjoyed. I liked trying to figure out the flavors and aromas with this one. Very well balanced. I think I'm going to have to buy another bottle soon!"
"D - Very highly drinkable DIPA with plenty of balance."
"D- This could be an everyday drinker! Why can't I find this in 6-packs instead of just bombers? The alcohol bite never comes thru... that is until you stand up after drinking a bomber of it! Overall... a remarkable IPA... Gotta get more of this before it disappears!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's one of my favorite hoppy beers I can find regularly. A very good beer overall, and one I don't have often enough."
"D/O - Pretty solid DIPA, although toward the lower end of the scale. Complexity and balance could be improved,and I'd reconsider the woodiness, but all-in-all it's a thumbs up."
"This is a previously underrated beer, but the new top 100 has it right. Hop Stoopid is a solid DIPA!"
"Good feel to this. The body seems a bit heavy but it's not of done. Kind of sticky one the finish but the carbonation is good. Drinks amazingly. It's pretty dangerous the I drive by a store that sells these around five bucks a bomber every day."
"D - Some DIPA's that approach the 10% ABV are a bit much to enjoy more than one or two in a session but this brew was so well crafted I wish I had another bomber. A value at $3.99!!"
"D- Not horribly upset I cannot get this one all the time. It is a nice change, but not worth trading for. If I move, I do see myself enjoying on a bi-monthly rate."
"This is a great beer and a very reasonably priced one as well. Well done Lagunitas."
"Strongly recomended. My go to beer for DIPA."
"Overall, a very nice IPA, would for sure drink it again."
"Holy crap. I have never had a beer like this. This more than earns its name. So good. Probably the best IIPA I have ever had ever. And what a value! Holy crap."
"A good ale. I dont know if id purchase it again anytime soon... Definitely not a beer id want to drink night after night."
"M&D- A really great drinkability for a DIPA. Most of the ones i'm used to have closer to a 10% ABV. A smooth finish almost like a really nice pilsner or lager. I don't really think i' d want to drink this on a really hot day, it just seems to suck the moisture out of my tongue."
"The CPJ"
"Drunkability: I would say it is a pretty drinkable DIPA that doesnt overly hopkill your taste buds. And at 8abv it wouldnt take to many to do the deed."
"D-good brew overall."
"D: Passed this beer up many of times I have had quite a few of lagunitas beers and have not been impressed by many. this is no exception."
"Very drinkable. Was kicking myself for only buying one bottle."
"I could drink a couple of these. The hoppyness fades faster than most, making me want another sip."
"Bottle. Clear gold pour with thin white head. Aroma is all american soapy hops, quite piney. Very bitter taste, pretty straightforward. Palate is thin, well hidden alcohol. Overall, it was good IPA but not phenomenal in my book. I have to say that the drinkability was very nice and the beer was well balanced."
"Final thought - Lagunitas and IBU's make so much sense"
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a copper orange color with a 1 finger white head that leaves some nice lace as it settles. Nice hop aroma of orange rind, some tropical, and a touch of pine. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet tropical and orange flavor upfront with a building bitterness that is with you through your entire drink. Ends with a lingering bitterness. The booze is well hidden. Overall, I decent and certainly easy to get DIPA that fixes the hop crazy whenever the situation arises."
"Very good beer. If it wasn't for the bomb at the very end, this would have just been another IPA on the market. The uniqueness makes it stand out, even though it doesn't suit my taste."
"D. Drinkability was very good. Was not to complex and wasnt something you would need to just sip. Really enjoyed this IPA"
"This is absurdly drinkable and smooth for its 100+ IBU content-I almost don't believe them! Love this beer."
"Picked this one up just because it was something I hadn't tried, and was glad I did. Poured lightly carbonated with a small head, golden color. Scents were muted, but nice with light hops and floral notes. The flavor was the strong point, with almost perfectly balanced hops and malty sweetness. Is this possible in a beer with such a moniker? Mouthfeel was nice with hops sticking around for awhile, and very drinkable. It was very good to have a beer that was this good with such hoppiness, balanced and not all over the place. Win."
" Not as hazey as a hefvieisen"
"Overall, nice imperial IPA but I have had better. I like my DFH 90 min more than this...and would probably stick to that."
"Very, very drinkable for having such a high alcohol content."
"An excellent example of an Imperial IPA done with good ole American swagger that is almost too drinkable...went down fast enoughy you can easily outdrink the ABV so be careful and pace yourself!!!"
"While the abv is somewhat apparent, drinkiability is still quite good; easy to get through this in a hurry."
"Anyways, I poured this SOB into a large Kerr jar, my new favorite IPA vessel. A deep orange copper, eggshell head, nothing too special there. The smell is a rich tropical freight train of hop love. So wonderful. Candied pineapple is dominant, with mango, passion fruit and guava. Awesome. Almost reminiscent of tropical fruit Skittles, my favorite kind. The taste cashes the check that the smell wrote, but it's more piney and bitter with citrus rind. The tropical fruit isn't as present, but the richness of the taste is wonderful. Resins dominate the tongue. A little heat from the ethyl, but not much. The mouthfeel is nice, and this ale is drinkable."
"Pours a very nice crystal clear orange body. Creamy one and half finger off white head. Mostly tight creamy bubbles and some big ones mixed in. This fades to a nice cap that can be roused quite easily in my snifter glass. Long clingy alcohol lacing as well. Smells big time of citrus, apricots, lemony hops, sweet carmel malts, some slight earthiness. Tastes very sweet at first, carmel, toffee. Mid palate I get earthy, piney, resinous hops. Some citrus and lemon. On this finish a nice smooth lingering, oily finish. Very balanced and very much what I like. Medium carbonation, full bodied. I'm going to easily finish this bomber myself. I'd easily pick this up again for $5.50."
"This pours a solid, clear bronze with a white, frothy head that dies down but not totally out. It wants to leave some lace but seems to struggle a bit. On the nose there is a hop assault, orange zest, an over the top citrus vibe, oranges for miles. In the mouth it's a medium or medium thin body carrying the orange from the nose, perhaps a little more subdued here. There is a long finish of hop bitterness at the back of the mouth. It's a bit one-dimensional but it's a good dimension. A lot less complex than other DIPAs I've had lately, but plenty enjoyable in its own right, and unbeatable at the price."
"D: Very drinkable. 8% is a good IPA strength . This is tasty and goes down easy. All in all a very good deal for a $5 bomber in NYC. I would definitely buy this again."
"Taste: Overwhelming earthy hops that seep into a crunchy malt. Hints of cotton candy and spices steep onto the palate among the earth and malt. The bitterness lingers in the background."
"D- Superbly drinkable!"
"D - Very drinkable if you only have one or two."
"D - I actually thought this was quite drinkable for the stated 102 IBUs - don't know the date on the bottle but thought this was quite smooth and had a nice hoppiness balanced with some sweet maltiness. Bought this at a health foods market locally for $3.50/bomber - would buy this quite often at that price range..."
"Very pleasing, a big brew, hides alcohol well. Easy to drink."
"Pours a bright copper color with large light tan head. Lots of lace. I can smell this beer from a couple of feet away. It is tropical and citrus fruit. Obviously some malt to support it. Tart and citrus fruity up front then mellows into a malty little and ending in a slightly dry slightly bitter aftertaste. The body is medium, the carbonation is medium and smooth. Very nice mouthfeel. Overall and tasty brew and like many often mention on BA a great value."
"D - Great DIPA, full flavored, assertive, balanced, and easy on the palate. Gives DFH 90 Min. and Green Flash WC IPA a run for their money as my favorite DIPA."
"M/D: On the thinner side. Its obvious the bottle is past its prime. Don't know the date, but wouldn't be surprised if it was 2009. Very sad, hopefully I can find a fresher bottle since this looks like a beer that is right up my alley."
"Pours a medium orange color into a tulip glass. Thin white head that quickly disappears into a sliver. The smell of this beer is very fruity, pineapple mainly, a little pear. The hops also come through after the first few sips. The taste is pretty good- lots of sweetness w/ a mouthful of hops! Pineapple, pear, apple, and hops all come through to me, with the hops and pineapple out front. Carbonation is fairly present on this beer as well. As hoppy as this beer is, the sweetness gives it a smoothness- and as a result it's extremely drinkable. I can't really taste much alcohol either, it's very well masked. This is a great beer, and at $4.95 for a bomber, a great value as well. I will continue to pick this one up and enjoy it. Cheers!"
"On the drinkability level, Only a tad expensive, I love it. Could pound one down almost as fast as a Pliny."
"It is very rare these days for a brew to live up to its name but Lagunitas does a pretty stand up job here. While I think Lagunitas produces IPA's with a bit more malt presence than others they always finish so clean and refreshing. The IBU's in this DIPA are evident (102 IBU 4 U) and are nicely balanced by some of that residual sweetness. Great drinkability at 8% ABV you almost have to search for the alcohol. A solid purchase for the price everytime!"
"Overall the flavor is balanced and delicate - not too bitter due to a fair amount of malt balance."
"Light body with a lot of hop flavor but not the overwhelming hop bitterness."
"D: Highly drinkable, not a hint of alcohol here. The sweetness at the finish compliment the bitters quite well. A good quality DIPA."
"Drinkability is decent. This is a pretty good beer, but I can't help but feel like there are many better DIPAs out there."
"D: This is one of my favorite DIPA's out, the only bad thing is that i can't get it at home in NM."
"Drinkability: Similar to Maximus (which I reviewed yesterday) but better. The flavor profile is better balanced here than in the too sweet Maximus. Very solid overall. However, while a great priced bomber, it is not quite a top-notch DIPA."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable, but at 8% and given the amount of flavor here I probably would move onto something lighter afterwards. As with any DIPA the palate is usually destroyed so you may as well switch to something cheaper afterward."
"Very drinkable beer, would like to see more bright tones of american hops in the nose and flavor profile, but other than that this beer is extremely drinkable. Have been drinking A LOT of IPAs the last few weeks, and unless this bottle is just off or slightly old (the latter I do not think is the case, no signs of oxidation on a light body and colored beer) the hop character is simply fairly mellow on the nose and palate."
"Quite a drinkable hop attack. Caramel and honey bread sweetness which is perhaps higher than average. Tropical fruits, citrus, floral hops all there, a nice long bitter finish. ABV is there but somehow the sweetness and the bitterness work in tag team and the glass disappears too quickly. Rolling carb, nice weight - well done and will gladly seek it out again, a good value as well."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Pours a slightly dark orange. hardly any head to speak of. Smell is Wow! Big burst of grapefruit, pineapple, very juicy fruit like. Taste is more grapefruit and then slides into bitter and hoppy. Its a nice bitter and doesn't really linger too long. I actually expected more bite from this one. But overall still a nice DIPA and one you could drink a couple of."
"Drinkability: For all the hype about 100+ IBUs, I found this somewhat ordinary; it's a very good beer but I have had many DIPAs I would prefer; still, at its price point, this is a very good value"
"A very delicious beer and a must try, especially at only $5 a pop. This is a go to DIPA for me quite often."
"D: I imagine this isn't as fresh as it could be. Still, it packed a sizeable hoppy bite and nice west-coast flavours with being overpowering. A great DIPA, will look for it again the next time I'm stateside."
"Fairly easy drinking for 8 abv and a real nice nose too. Good price point also make for high drinkability too."
"Poured out of a bomber bottle into a snifter and there is little head to speak of. When held up to the light the beer is a light amber color. Much lighter than I had expected. As the beer is swirled in the snifter there is a good amount of lace left behind. The smell is strong in citrus fruits, a delicious nose of hops. Make no mistake this is a hop bomb in every sense of the word. The taste continues the nose with a very strong hop taste a little malt sweetness that doesn't quite balance with the hops, bu that's alright with me. There is a some carbonation that resonates in my mouth making the bitterness linger. This beer is very very bitter I throughly enjoy the bomber but couldn't imagine having much more than that. Another solid beer from a brewery that loves hops as much as I do."
"Drinkability. A great drinker. Almost no alcohol presence and dry hoppy goodness make this go down easy."
"Other than the booziness, which I can manage, I am only really disappointed by one thing: the aroma/flavoring hops. There could be so much more citrusy and/or earthy hop flavor and aroma that could take this brew from """hop stoopid""" to """hop awesome.""""
"This one was bottled about a month and a half ago. Pours a almost clear, golden-orange color with a small white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is very citrusy with some sweet malty aromas as well. A bit of alcohol can also be detected in the aroma behind all those wonderful hop scents. Tastes is initially sweet malt with some tasty melon flavors. Then you get the citrus hops (grapefruit, orange, and maybe even a bit of pineapple). There is also a nice balance pine flavors as well. Alcohol is hidden well. Mouthfeel is a bit on the sticky side, but still very crisp with fairly high drinkability. Overall, this is a solid brew, but it doesn't hold a candle to it's Elder neighbor who resides about 15 minutes away in Santa Rosa."
"Overall: I selected Hop Stoopid based on a review in one of the beer mags. It's a good beer, but there are other beers equally as good, much easier to obtain, and at a much better price. I'd buy this beer if it were competitively priced with other strong IPAs."
"A fantastic beer at bargain-bin prices! It doesn't get much better than that!"
"Somewhat of a palate ripper; sooper tasty, wonderfully hoppy, but definitely limited slightly in terms of back to back capabilities."
"Unknown how old the bottle is, although this is new to NH so I assume it might be fairly fresh."
"D: Extremely easy to drink. Perfectly balanced and interesting enough to drink several of these. Definitely wish I bought more. A must try for an IPA lover."
" Overall, I like this beer a lot."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is great and is very hoppy. I get a ton of pine and papaya, with some other hop notes mixed in as well. The flavor is just as good, if not better. I get a lot of papaya, pine, pineapple and a little bit of biscuit malt. The beer has a ton of hop flavor. Low to medium bitterness and extremely drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A great beer and a great value."
"Nice mouthfeel, little carbonation. Really full on the palate. This beer is a great thirst quencher that I had over lunch. Def recommend. "
"Poured from 750ml bottle into cold pint glass with burger at restaurant in Arlington, VA. Deep hazed orange pour, decants a frothy eggshell cap that lasts and laces well. Pine in the nose is upfront, lots of citrus, almost solventy, herbal, perfumey, quite floral too with a good dose of caramel malts. Tastes initially of spruce and pine, leading to citrus rind (mostly grapefruit). Also present is peach and other sweet fruit, lots of bready caramel malts too. Quite assertively bitter and hoppy, with a lengthy hoppy finish, with a lingering alcoholic flavour which is not unpleasant. Very tasty DIPA!"
"Another brew with that Lagunitas compulsive drinkability - don't know how they do it but I love it!"
"NOTES: An enjoyable medium carbonated 8.0% ABV beer that is a touch sweet, and very citrusy. I could drink these all day long on a hot summer day."
"Taste - Nice hop rush as soon as it hits your lips, For 100 IBUs it doesn't blow me away all the way through. A lot of malt in the finish. Just not as balanced as I would like but all in all a very good DIPA."
"reviewed from notes. golden copper in color. smells like pine hops (as expected) and caramel malts. extremely good, but a little malty for the style. taste is an explosion of pine, followed by a malty taste/aftertaste. very drinkable, with average head and lacing."
"drinkability; I not crazy about this style but this on was finishable. The hops are strong but the aftertaste does not throw me off with too much bitterness. When my nose is stuffed and my palate is weak, I'll turn to this one again to remained me of how delicious beer is."
"D- It goes down surprisingly easy. Although I'm not sure if that is what I look for in a DIPA. I expect a bit more of a bite in the finish."
"D: Very drinkable for an imperial ipa, crispness and bitterness on the finish makes it drinkable."
"Really enjoyable beer, but not blown away by my first 100+ IBU beer. I'll chalk it up to a freshness issue and try it again in the future. Looks great, a beautiful honey color with a nice cloudy puffy head that's well retained and leaves lacing all over. The smell is more sweet than anything else really. The taste is rather mild in the hops department, but I hold nothing against this beer. Overall flavor and body is full which is nice, I can keep drinking this for a while."
"It went pretty well with some extra-sharp New York cheddar cheese and crackers. I used a becker glass; next time I might try something not quite as open at the top like a pilsner glass."
"Awesome DIPA. Very drinkable, very hoppy and very delicious."
"Drinkability is very good here. When cold this concoction rises above a lot of other medium priced 8% IPA's."
"I could see myself over the charcoal grill in the summer with this baby."
"D - I could have alot of these. Shamefully I probably won't see this again as this was a goody brought home from Boston recently. Wish I had another."
"D: All night IPA if you can handle the 8% ABV and the 102 IBU's - if you can, brother this is your beer!"
"D- Very good, Im almost done with it already and Im a pretty fast typer."
"reasonably priced, too."
"The mouthfeel is also very good, it's fairly full bodied and rather sticky. The hop flavor really lingers around for a while. The drinkability is also surprisingly great, for the ABV this goes down super easily, without a hint of alcohol. One of the best parts about this brew that really needs to be mentioned is the price. For a double IPA, this is really the best value out there. Four bucks for an DIPA bomber of this quality is really laughable. Lagunitas always is a great value. Buy it."
"D- Very drinkable and a lot of fun with the hops"
"Everything from it's floral aroma to it's grapefruit notes, this beer rivals any Imperial IPA in America. It's inexpensive and pairs well with any 72% cacao bar. I drink this beer a lot...it's very consistent...I have never had a bad/skunky bottle. I would even venture to say that this beer is better than Pliney the Elder...for real."
"Mouth is full and acidic, floral hop flavor lingers. Although high in alcohol, there is no heat in the mouth. Very bold beer."
"D: Really love the profile of this beer, easy to drink and still holds huge body and character. The balance here is so well done it is hard to see the imperial or double part of it. Great beer that deserves a try."
"Given the 102 IBUs and 8% ABV, Hop Stoopid is really a pretty drinkable DIPA. The alcohol is almost untraceable, though you do taste all 102 of those IBUs. Between the great mouthfeel, high drinkability and pungent hop flavor this one of the better DIPAs on the market. At $4.99 for a 22oz, its a damn good deal too."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber. The beer is a vibrant orange-amber coloring, with a thin film of head. The nose is all hops, with slight hints of sweet citrus. The beer has a round and sweet hop forward flavor, with a smoked hop backbone. Citrus notes throughout help to balance all the flavor. Very green flavors throughout, also. Crisp and light finish, with a slight sour aftertaste. The green also tags through to the finish, as well. Very sweet linger to the flavor. Easy to drink, and much lighter on the hops than we were expecting looking at the IBUs. Unbelievably easy to drink...could get dangerous."
"This is a quite drinkable beer. Many of the incredibly high hopped beers seem to melt your palate, and this seems a little less likely. The ABV is reasonably covered and the dryness lingers long enough to bring you back to the next drink."
"I was blown away by this brew...perhaps I had an aged bottle, but it was truly a blessing. I would suggest this beer to IPA lovers."
"Color is pale gold/orange in color with a beautiful creamy head. The head clings to the glass during the drink. The smell is tropical, crisp, and beautiful. You get orange, pineapple, and passion fruits all on the pass. I don't detect any pine-aroma hops at first, but later down the drink more are apparent in the smell. The taste is rather balanced for a big imperial IPA. Lagunitas does a good job with malts to balance out the high levels of bittering hops. The taste is where you get hit with pine bittering hops. It's drinks exceptionally easy for a large beer. Overall, this beer is meant to showcase hops. If you're a hop-head check out this beer. It's also super cheap - retailing around $3.50 - so you won't hate picking a few."
"Mouthfeel is nicely medium-bodied and almost full in consistency. Really great mouthfeel to this DIPA with amazing drinkable capabilities. One bomber isn't really enough for a night, considering how well this drinks. For around $5 a bomber, this will probably be my other go-to DIPA besides Stone's. A great stepping stone for would-be IPA venturers. Definitely tastes more than its inexpensive price tag."
"Hop Stoopid, is FUN to drink"
"Was expecting a much more bitter hop taste from this beer (hence the name) but to my surprise, I was blown away on how balanced this IIPA is!! The hop taste does linger a bit, but the malt sweetness dulls the bitterness perfectly! This is a wonderful beer overall, and very drinkable. I think I might have a new IIPA for a while. To bad this doesn't come in a six pack!! ha!"
"Its a good beer, just not my favorite IPA; I prefer more citrus flavors."
"22oz bomber from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI. Pours a clear amber hue with three fingers of bubbly off-white foam. A few dots of lacing cling to the nonic. Smell is an intense, flowery bouquet of perfume-like hops, pine sap, cedar needles, tangerine rind, taffy, and hints of tropical fruit (pineapple, mango). Taste follows the nose with bright Clementine, orange peel, some toffee and cookie dough sweetness, and a punchy, acidic juiciness to finish. IBUs briefly tickle the palate but the bitterness is balanced by the malts. Also, the 8% ABV is undetectable. Overall, this is one of the most flavourful, aromatic, and hop-forward DIPAs that I've consumed in a while. A phenomenal brew."
"Wait, now I am starting to understand the name. Hop Heads, enjoy."
"pours a really nice amber yellow orange color with a big egg shell white head that has big honeycomb lacing down the sides of the glass. really nice look and classic, just slightly hazy DIPA appearance. aroma is sweet pineapples, mangoes, pines and grapefruit. lots of big sticky resins coming through.The flavors match the aromas with mostly sweet pineapple and grapefruit flavors blending together. It has a really nice bready malt backbone that balances this beer well. there is also a nice carbonation level that makes this really cleansing. not super fresh tasting, but the hops are prominent and really give this a hop forward dryness on the palate. The drinkability also has a high score for me because its not super high alcohol, though it is strong, its drinkable and feels like a 6% beer rather than an 8th. Really great value and go to DIPA for me."
"22 oz. bottle with no freshness date. 1.085 OG, 102 IBUs, bittered with hop extract. Pours a nice orange hue, unfiltered yet damn near crystal-clear, with medium carbonation and a half inch of whitish head that leaves a bit of lacing. Orange and pineapples dominate the aroma, with floral and perfumy notes following close behind. No real malt aroma, but this is certainly OK for the style. Nothing but hops on the palate - in a very good way. The orange, tropical fruits, mint?, tobacco? and coating resiny/oily stickiness overwhelms the whisper of honeyed malt sweetness, which then leads into a very potent, yet incredibly smooth bitterness that lingers on and on. It has moderate carbonation, and its somewhat substantial body does not hamper its drinkability in any way. This brew is too easy to drink - it packs loads of hop flavor without overloading the malt bill with crystal malts just to make it drinkable. Well-worth trying this one out."
"D: Finally--the elusive draft of Hop Stoopid... Sitting at the brewery pub, just down the road from Santa Rosa, it is hard not to evaluate this beer in the context of Sonoma County's most famous DIPA--Russian River's Pliny the Elder. While the freshness of a bottle may leave some doubts, when tasted on-draft and from the source this beer is impressive. The intensity of the hop aromas alone are irresistible. While I thought that kegged Hop Stoopid was a unique occurrence at the source, a stop at the Santa Rosa Whole Foods and their amazing 14-tap beer bar showed that it does travel. Hopefully, one day it will make it onto the menus in O.C."
"I've updated my reviews on this over time because it's grown on me over time. Excellent beer, and excellent value for IPA lovers."
"Overall: a solid double IPA with decent flavor and balance. well done and worth trying. There are others that I prefer more than this offering though. A well done beer nonetheless."
"Just bought my third bottle. I'll only add that this is a sweeter DIPA, but considering how hoppy it is (floral hoppy, not bitter hoppy), it is only slightly out of balance. The sweetness may land the knockout blow but not without a real battle with the hops."
"D: If your looking for something that is easy to drink and good for a hot summers day this is the beer for you!"
"Had this on tap at Haymarket in Chicago. Pour is a nice gold with a good couple fingers of head, good lacing. The citrus hops leap off the beer and follow through in the taste. A nice bitter finish with a crisp end that doesn't leave a resiny finish. Not super balanced with the malt but there is a bit of sweetness in the middle to hold things together. Perhaps a bit thinner than I would like but overall not bad and this is insanely drinkable. Great go to cheap beer for the style."
"Wow, I removed the cap and after about two seconds the foam started flowing out of the top of the bottle. For that much action there was only a one finger head, but it lasts a long time. Lots of thick lace, good cling. Color is a 9 on the SMR chart. Smell is hop city, followed by caramel, orange, lime and malt. Taste is big on hops, lime, lemon, grapefruit and a little malt. Heavy mouthfeel, creamy and almost chewable. Great flavor and body, only drawback for be is it is a bit heavy in the tummy so not a good all nighter."
"A great value for a DIPA, probably the best I can think of. As far as getting a West Coast flavor on the East Coast in something that moves quick enough to get it relatively fresh where I live, this is pretty tops."
"I bought this bottle on sale for $2.99 at a corner liquor store, seemed like a good deal. Pours a copper color with some pine hops and resin smell. Tastes about the same, not bad, but not great. Would only buy this if it were on sale again, otherwise I'd go with a lot of other things."
"Decent, not great."
"Pours a clear golden amber with foamy thick white head. Nose is primairly grapefruit, citrus, some slight floral and pine auromas. Taste is straight up bitter, more pine overall on the palatte. Citrus into the finish which ends dry. Crisp and clean tasting, medium bodied mouthfeel. Great beer, wonderful DIPA, goes down oh so smooth."
"A great beer no doubt! Lots of hops and cheap any way you slice it. This beer needs to get more recognition. How is this not if the top 100???"
"D: Can barely tell this is an alcoholic beverage despite the 8% mark; two glasses of this were very enjoyable and I wouldn't mind another."
"overall a good to very good beer. i will definitely be getting a few more of these in the future."
"Tasted on draft at Kuma's Corner. Pours clear bright orange with a thick white head that sticks around for a long time. Nose features both bitter grapefruit and tropical fruit hops with a great caramal malt aroma as well. The flavors are sweet malt up front quickly moving to hops domination, but maintaining balance all the way through. The body is full with average carbonation and a long bitter hops and sweet malt finish."
"D - A good beer, very well balanced. Will be getting Hop Stoopid again soon"
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the balance. With this style, it can become a contest of who can infuse the most hop character into their beer. Here, there is an unexpectedly balancing malt flavoring through the middle, which makes an already good beer into something unique and fantastic."
"One of the best DIPAs I have had and that too at a great price; but not as good as I thought before reviewing. Also, I have had it alongside Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Elder deserves to be the legend it is."
"Poured from a 22 ouch bomber into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Nice puffy head of foam that sticks to the sides of the glass on the way down. Light orange copper color with small bubbles rising to the top. Hop aroma really packs a punch with a lingering smell of hop oils. Even though this is 8%, the potency is easily masked. Overall, this is a very smooth and enjoyable brew."
"notes: if hops (and plenty of them) is your thing, this ale deserves your attention"
"D - quite so given the ABVs and IBUs and so forth. Simply a pleasant, well rounded exemplar. And cheap to boot!"
"This beer really revisits what started my love for beer; it brings back memories of my first IPAs where all my palate could pick up was hops. This beer shows that sometimes you don't need much depth of flavor to make a good beer, and at $5 a bomber, I will be picking up a few more of these."
"It goes down easy for what it is, but the amount of hops and higher ABV makes this one and done with a bomber. Probably not going to properly enjoy another brew as much after the hops are done with your palate here anyway."
"Hop Stoopid is a medium bodied with ample carbonation. At 7%, it's a very drinkable DIPA and a good example of the style."
"Pours a deep clear golden copper color with a bubbly white head that shows remarkable resilience as I try to swallow it off the top. Smells of hops. No kidding really it does. Pine, resin, citrus, apricots, grapefruit its all there. I can't find any malt in the aroma, but that's not really the point here is it. The aroma on this one is all about the hops. Surprisingly smooth drinking. hints of caramel up front that are assaulted almost immediately with citrus resin and pine. Smoothly bitter but the hops assert themselves midway through and into a long lingering resin and grapefruity finish. Medium body with an almost sweet but very resinous mouthfeel. Medium light level of carbonation. I quite enjoyed this one! Quite reasonably priced at just under six dollars too. Thank you for coming to NH Lagunitas, I might just have to find a place for this one in the rotation."
"While it's not bad (though I might have been pretty tough in critiquing), it's not something I think I'll be returning to anytime soon if ever."
"I like this beer. It's a solid DIPA, and I could drink a good bit of it. Laginitas created a ridiculously hop-forward beer, and I thank them for it."
"Though not the hop assault you expect from the name, this is a tasty beer and a very pleasant drinker; would get this again."
"D: This is fantastic if you like light-bodied, drinkable, citrus bombs; therefore, I like it very much."
"On a side note: My wife hates bitter IPAs and she really liked this one. She said it had a nice citrus taste to it and smelled amazing."
"Overall, the excellent flavors in this beer carry it to a good rating. I have some minor issues with the overall makeup of the beer, but the flavors are spot on, which is always the most important thing."
"D - Went down relatively easy, enjoyed this one."
"D - Like I said before, couldn't tell this was 8%. The drinkability is solid, and I have no problem finishing the bottle."
"No doubt, I'll enjoy this one all night. Unbelievably good for the price, but not as good as some others on the market. Just too much deliberate hoppiness to be even close to delicate."
"Nose is massively hoppy, sharp but calming. First sip is bitter and it takes the tongue a minute to adjust. They nailed the aftertaste and mouthfeel on this one too, a fun lingering piney bite on the roof and sides of the mouth and alcohol might as well be mid 5s instead of 8 for how well it is hidden. What a clean brew, I usually have one of these in my fridge whatever the weather outside, which is a compliment to the brew."
"A clear golden-copper colored ale with a nice head retention from a decent head; no lacing to note. The nose is massive amounts of tangerine citrus fruit, with a little fresh peach and mango. The taste is very similiar, loaded with fresh citrus, mostly tangerine, some peach and mango add some hop complexity and then a decent amount of floral pine bitterness to balance out the sweetness from the malts which contributes a nice sweet undertone to the taste. The carbonation is spot-on, I could use more hop resin but overall the floral tones of the hops dont require big thick resins to coat the palate. Overall, this DIPA is amazing, one of the best, most enjoyable and easy to find DIPA's around. At times it can be hard to find fresh."
"summary- this is a nice IPA with fresh citrus hops. If you like orange notes this is the one to behold. It does not feel like a double. It is missing that big malt and hops punch that I expect of the style. None the less it is decent and flavorful. Presentation was sub-par though. I think the ABV is lower than advertised."
"I love this beer. One of my favorites from Lagunitas. I get oranges and hops on the nose. When I take a sip I get more of the oranges but the hops aren't overpowering, I can taste the hops for a second then the bitterness takes over. At 102 IBU it can be very bitter to some people but not to me. I just get a sweet orange taste that lingers on my palate for a while. A high recommendation for anyone looking to try to this beer."
"Tastes big and bitter yes, but there's a smoothness that keeps everything in the middle of the road despite reaching high speeds. Outstanding beer that knows where to draw all the near perfect lines."
"Drinkability: Smooth and refreshing. One I can certainly drink glass after glass with out thinking about it. Me likes."
"Lagunitas Hop Stoopidnice has an orange colour with an excellent 1 cm head. It has a nice hoppy orange smell with a hint of pineyness. The taste is very nice: a nice orange flavour with a tiny hint of bitterness at the end. It feels ok in the mouth and is a very nice imperial IPA."
"Drink - A truly outstanding IPA that I'll be happy to have again. For the price this really is a great beer - be sure to seek it out if you haven't already."
"I would like to try this on tap. I've found that beers that I didn't approve much of in a bottle actually was more pleasing on draft."
"D - If you love hops you will love this beer. It has a very good hop flavor and goes down really smooth. I would have no problem drinking a few of these. This is a great beer."
"Pours a nice clear, dark golden amber with the whitest of heads- though it doesn't stay too long. Small amounts of lacing down the glass. Very classic hoppy aroma and taste, with hints of sweet honey and grapefruit. Nothing complex, but a great double IPA. So smooth for an 8%, I could drink this all night."
"Verdict: A hop atom bomb, but very good and worth tracking down."
"Overall one of my favorite Double IPAs. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"Poured into a dogfish head beer glass. Was very excited at the 104 ibus that this bottle boasts. Almost no head, which surprised me. The best part of this beer is the aromatic hop fragrance- definitely nice pine, grapefruit, and citrus aromas there. But, sad to say that I was overall dissapointed in the lack of malt backbone, and lack of complexity to this one. I'm not sure if the lack of flavor had to do with the fact that hop extracts were used intentionally, but I expected something more. Between this title, and their everyday ipa, the only real difference in taste is with the aroma."
"Overall a nice imperial IPA. It is nothing to complex but it tastes good. It is a good beer but it is nothing amazing or ground breaking."
"This brew pours a light hazy orange hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head that slowly recedes to a one layer of froth and sporadic lacing here and there,the aroma is a strong mix of piney hops,light citrus,light toffee and piney hops,the taste is quite subdued compared to the aroma but is very drinkable which starts off with a light to medium bodied mouthfeel and leaves tastes of stonefruit,citrus,light toffee and piney hops all lingering on the palette but the finish is not the hoppy bitter bomb you would expect its more of a bittersweet finish almost like hops dipped in caramel and overall its a very nice drop thats very easy to drink and would have no problem finishing more than the one of."
"Bright yellow in color with an orange hue and a slight haze. Light white head on the pour that reduces to a wispy white cap. Intense orange, grapefruit and lemon hoppy aroma with a sweet honey and malt beneath. Medium bodied with light carbonation and smooth feel. Flavors are much the same as the aromas. Intense citrus orange, grapefruit and lemon with a honey and sweet malty backbone. Finishes very clean with a light bitter ending the doesn't linger long. Goes down very easy and no hints of a higher ABV."
"Tastes much nicer, much more balanced, although it's lacking the kind of wicked hop variegation I look for in an elite double IPA. Still, it's very nicely balanced, with the high alpha grapefruit hops starting things off and moving into a toasty, peaty malt finish that ends with a lingering sweetness."
"Drinkability: Really easy to drink, not overly taxing on the tastebuds in regards to the aftertaste."
"Hop oils as opposed to hops.... hashish as opposed to buds? Method to the madness? Whatever the motive, it worked quite well, don't change a thing. There are a lot of good things to say about this brew."
"D - Not bad at all. Wouldn't be able to pound it like I could a Pliny, but it's really a much thicker brew. Much better than the first time I had it, that must have been a bad bottle, cause this stuff is divine."
"Drinkability is very good for a beer of this strength. The alcohol is well hidden and I probably wouldn't have known it was there until it snuck up on me."
"Very well done IIPA. Up with the best I've had. I'd put it at par with Pliney the Elder for overall enjoyment - though it's tipped to freshness and fruit rather than to resinous herbal characters. Great aroma, great flavor, finishes well, easily drinkable - I'll say it again - very well done."
"I had to sip this one and it still took me an hour to finish my half of the bomber."
"Overall, this is a very good example of an American Double IPA. As with most beers of this strength/IBU just one will wear out your pallet, but this beer shows what the West Coast style is all about."
"In light of recent discussions on the Aus. forum I disclose that this is a grey import. For what it's worth. A beer that gets some serious coverage on this site from our American beer enthusiasts. It's good for sure, maybe just not the pants-wetter I thought it might be. """But you're not drinking it how the brewer intended!""". Yeah, yeah, fair enough. Although the pine-citrus hop presence is quite enticing I find the amount of malt sweetness to be almost reminiscent of an Aussie version of an IIPA. A deep, bittersweet beer with an aggressive mouthfeel and a finish to remember. Delicioso."
"drinkability- could drink this one just about everyday but unfortunately i dont think there is enough at my local packy to do that"
"Poured into my newly acquired Maudite snifter, Hop Stoopid is a lovely shade of golden orange, vividly colorful and clear with a topping of bubbly white head. Not very strong head retention but still left a considerable amount of lacing on the glass. This one smells like a handful of freshly picked citrusy hops, I want a air freshener that smells like this. Taste is much of the same...thank goodness! Starts off sweet and juicy with a slightly spicy bitterness to finish it off. Deliciously hoppy but balanced enough to not completely destroy your tongue. With something this hopped up you might expect to be a little syrupy but it is well carbonated and the mouthfeel is spot on. At 102 IBUs this one is a keeper ladies & gents!"
"Appearance and smell-wise, it's exactly what I'd expect from a quality IPA or APA. I do have some qualms, however, with the taste. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth, while not encumbering the taste, which is frankly bitter for the sake of being bitter. It's really hoppy, which I enjoy, but the hoppy taste feels forced as if it were a product of an extract rather than brewing. It's worth checking out but overall not impressive."
"If you haven't had this, and you like american style IPAs or Double IPAs then you have got to check this beast out!!"
"Pours a clean, clear gold color with active carbonation, good retention and lacing. Scent brings a good, strong combination of citrus, floral and piney hops with some astringency to it. Taste brings a strong but not overpowering bitter bite, lots of grapefruit, mild pine, some apricot and flower notes. Astringency from scent doesn't carry over to taste, lightly sweet malt background. Medium bodied, slightly high in carbonation for the style, no lingering tastes. A really good dIPA for the price paid for a bomber. Great taste, lacking only a few minor tweaks that would make it top tier."
"Drink ability: Very easy. I really enjoy this beer. I compared it side by side to Pliny, which I really like, but Hop Stoopid is a touch smoother."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, goes down smoothly. The carbonation surely helps a bit."
"D: Easy drinking. All good."
"D= Really enjoyed drinking this one and it went down easy for me and for the price it's a great beer."
"Drinkability-overall not a bad beer but not what I expected. It was pretty easy to drink but i wasnt too impressed by it. Not one of the best from such a great brewery."
"Drinkability -- How is this so highly rated? Malting is adequate, but the hop profile is really far off. LOTS of onion and garlic; I left half of the glass at the bar. Funny how I remember this being so much better the times I've had it in the bottle..."
"Overall, Lagunitas has once again astounded me with an incredible brew. I wish they would touch up the label abit and i may have picked it up even sooner"
"MF/D- Medium body with good carbonation. Sticks to the palate nicely. Drinkability is very good, but couldn't see myself having more than a couple before my palate is gone."
"Many IPA's and DIPA's do not show well when cask conditioned. Hop Stoopid is an exception to this general rule, and IMHO, really shines on cask. Without doubt, my favorite cask conditioned DIPA. Excelllent stuff..."
"D- Just an awesome hoppy beer that goes down smooth. At under $5 a bottle this is an Imperial IPA I will go back to again and again. This definitely has a stoopid amount of hops!"
"Poured from bottle into tulip. A bright yellowish orange in color with a small white head that fades quickly and leaves some nice lacing. Smell is resiny hops, a bit of pine and tropical fruit. No malts, just hops, as a good double IPA should be. Flavor is bitter pine hops up front, with some pineapple and bright citrus flavors following. A light malt sweetness is there, just enough to bring some balance. Mouthfeel is medium body with a medium carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, no harsh flavors to overpower and the finish is just right to make me want more."
"Drinkability: High, but not as good as the regular version. I struggled a bit with the overwhelming aroma of sweet fruit juices. I like it better in a bottle for sure!"
"D- for the alcohol content, it is a dangerously drinkable beer."
"Lagunitas Hop Stoopid. I vaguely remember having this while at GABF this year but I found a bomber of it the other day so I can actually review it proper. I started by pouring this into my snifter glass and taking a big whiff. The aroma is all hops, specifically floral and pine. Smell goes on for days, and is pretty much incredible. Not too much of a head on this one, though what little there is clings desperately to the sides of the glass. Pretty high level of bitterness in this beer (it claims over 100 IBUs on the bottle), but it doesn't punch you in the face like others. In fact, there's a nice malt sweetness at the end of the whole affair. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, though it doesn't gum up your tongue like others can do. Carbonation is pretty flat, which isn't a shock considering the style. As you continue to partake the bitterness does increase. As you do that the hop bouquet opens up, with lots of floral, grassy, and pine flavors shining through. Beyond that is some tart malt sweetness chased by heavy hop bitterness ending in a sticky and somewhat sweet, yet clean, finish. I wonder if the tartness and the clean finish has to do with how this was fermented. No real alcohol presence comes through in this beer, which is kind of surprising considering the ABV (8%) and style. Must be under the layers of hops. Overall this is a very solid and very drinkable double IPA. Quite enjoyable."
"D - Oh so very drinkable. My bomber was gone in 10 minutes and I was ready for more."
"D-Great drinkability on this one.The bomber was gone in no time with no sign of the 8% ABV.The $3.99 price tag didn't hurt either."
"D. This is a great beer, at 8% it would be a good way to start the evening, and definitely one I would drink again."
"Great beer in combination with the price, Hop Stoopid is flat out ridiculous. My only wish is that this offering came in 12oz bottles though the bomber is not a bad serving size at all."
"Very well balanced for a Californian IIPA."
"D - Not a bad tasting beer at all. Reminds me a little of 90 Minute, but not as heavy and without the heavy alcohol presence. Good for a change up in the high IBU beer world."
"D- this is a good one, deserving of its high rating. Pretty cheap too...really good option, very easy drinking"
"D - This beer was pretty balanced for a IIPA and a beer named Hop Stoopid...but I'm not complaining...the hops were sweet, juicy and citrusy...a good beer all around"
"Poured from a bomber, straight from Lagunitas, into my Zatec fluted glass. Figured it was time to review my avatar. Finger of white head, with little retention, but some decent lacing. Seems to slowly be producing some bubbles. Amber/golden hue. Smell. Oh the smell. Dole in the house. Pineapple! PINE. Flowers. Citrus, earthy spice. On the tongue I'm getting grapefruit rind, lemon, some sort of clovey spicy thing goin. Nice bubbly mouthfeel. Drinks like a champ. 8 % beware!"
"medium-plus bodied with adequate carbonation; somewhat creamy. high marks for drinkability, this is going down great."
"A great example of a double IPA not too sweet and not too ridiculously bitter."
"Overall: Well, it is a bit unbalanced, but if you like strong, bitter hops, seek out this brew. One thing's for sure, this isn't a safe-leap beer, it is a big, risky brew with a lot of character."
"D: Drinkable, but not one I revisit!"
"This beer pours a surprisingly pale, golden color (I expect a much darker hue from a double IPA). The head doesn't stick around for too long, but does leave some pretty nice lacing. The aroma isn't too pungent with obvious notes of hops with a very interesting presence of banana/bubble gum. Despite an impressive IBU rating, the hoppiness of this beer is not that overpowering. A great hop front gives way to a super creamy, smooth finish. Most IPA's in this style would live a real dry finish, but not this one."
"D - Very drinkable to the hop head, I want the taste more every sip. Drinkable at the price ($4.99) will come back for another! Very recommended to the hop head IPA lover! I found a new favorite! Thumbs way up! Poured into a pint glass."
"I'm going to go back and buy another so that I can try and enjoy this beer."
"I have not been able to find Pliny the Elder on the East Coast. This is the closest beer I have found to it. A must-try for hopheads. Coors-light drinkers will loathe it!!!!"
"On a trivial note, I peel and save labels from new samples of beer, wine, and liquor and Lagunitas had the flimsiest paper for a label I have ever encountered."
"It has a nice thick mouthfeel with a spiciness provided by the hops. I could probably drink several of these, but then my hangover would be huge in the morning. Great beer, relatively easily available."
"D - a quality DIPA at an outrageously affordable price ($6.50/22oz in PA). i know they use extract for this and more power to them. definitely takes care of any big hop craving."
" Would love to partake in this one all day! These guys at Lagunitas sure have done their homework and produce some outstnding brews-Very Well Done!!!!"
"Drinkability is solid. Definitely not in the top tier of double IPAs but I would have it again."
"This beer poured a light amber color with about a half inch of head. It receded to a film of foam on the top replenished consistently but the visible carbonation. As the beer poured I slowly started to smell the citrus hops, which smelled like opening a bag of hop pellets. The taste matched the smell, with grapefruit in the forefront and some clementine or tangerine citrus in there as well. Super smooth, and drank pretty well for a DIPA, though with the high IBUs drinkability was not this beers strongest point. Very nice DIPA."
"O- A smooth and well done DIPA. I wasnt amazed but i will drink this again. The aroma is great, though i expected a more fruity flavor."
"This is a real treat."
"This is a regular in my rotation."
"Definitely, make this a stop on your beer journey."
"The 22 went down fairly well, but I'm glad it wasn't any more than that. Probably won't revisit because of the one-sidedness of the flavor, but it was worth a go."
"D: For such a high IBU beer, I had no trouble making this one disappear."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer that could do itself a favor by having some whole hops thrown into the recipe. Hop oil and extract isn't bad, but I feel it's more what homebrewers do, not a brewery like Lagunitas. The only thing that could make this beer better is a bit more juicy hoppiness in the flavor. Still, a pretty solid beer from a pretty solid brewery."
"Color me disappointed on this one....2 dimensional and like too many other pretentious 'intense' IPAs...I can take that but it had rough edges...lacked the rounding of a properly conditioned aled...released too soon."
"Taste is sweet upfront, citrus in the middle which morphs into a rising crescendo of grapefruit and bitterness to the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is superb for such a high IBU brew. Great one."
"Enjoyable? Yes. This is the best Lagunita's brew I've supped to date, which still leaves it in the """good""" category. But certainly not the mouth-bruiser that the """102 IBUs""" on the bottle advertised."
"- A must have brew in the fridge for a hophead as this brew will go great with some fresh grilled carne asada with home made hot salsa on a hot day"
"Overall this is an exceptionally smooth and balanced brew and one the the best deals on the market at around 5 bucks for a bomber. This one is a staple in my fridge."
"D- Easy to down. Very hoppy, but in an artificial way. Seems like hopsickle on a budget. Not bad, but after having it twice I don't think I'm a big fan of hop extract. Lacks a certain kick IMO."
"O - A fine and bright West Coast IPA that I'd be glad to have anytime."
"The best ipa I've had so far and one of my favorite beers so far!"
"D: A very nice IPA, lots of big hop flavor but the beer is balanced. For as many IBU's as is advertised, it was not as bitter as expected. Excellent beer."
"Drinkability - Excellent dipa. Huge hops, very high ibu's, with a slight malt backbone to balance it out some. Very fruity, and the price for a bomber is relaly good. One of the best dipa's out there for sure."
"A must try for any hophead."
"Poured a golden orange. Tall thick white head. Malty. Well balanced. Not as hopped as you would expect for a DIPA, especially 102 IBU'S. Very smooth and drinkable. Alcohol becomes evident as it warms. Medium bodied with a very clean finish. This is one of my favorites."
"Hop Stoopid indeed: overpoweringly fragrant, floral hoppiness, to the exclusion of every other sensation. In taste the brew confirmed the nose: bitter-bone dry, deliciously hoppy citrusy florally with a long, lingering finish. Creamy, foamy in the mouth. Instant addiction, drained the bomber...but, alas, it was only the one. """More Hop Stoopid!""" It hides its 8 percent ABV very nicely; I could easily have danced all night."
"One of the last casks of Raleigh Beer Week, at Busy Bee Cafe. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a nice frothy lasting off-white head. Aroma was a nice amount of floral citrus hops in front of sweet malts. The taste was loads of fresh citrus hops with a nice caramel malt backbone, this was obviously some fresh beer! The beer was medium bodied with very well hidden alcohol. I've been drinking a decent amount of this beer this summer, and I must say, it's even better on cask."
"Drinkability is good, only suffers because of bitterness. I definitely had no problem dusting off the entire bomber."
"D: This beer is very well balanced and due to that it's smooth and very drinkable. It's surprising to me that this is a double IPA as most beers in the style want to leave some sort of impression on your taste buds, but Hop Stoopid is extremely flavorful without being overpowering."
"Overall: Excellent Double IPA. This is an excellent offering from Lagunitas and one I would recommend highly. I was worried that it would have lost some of its flavor since it is a bit out of date but it was still delicious."
"Purchased at a small town market next to the Pala Mesa resort in Temecula California. Poured in a rocks glass at the hotel I was staying at. Following a nice bit of smoke the beer poured a light copper to amber hue. This gave way to about a quarter inch head. (I think the beer may of been a bit warm upon initial pour) Fruity, peach, roasted cherry and apple were the first things to come to the nose.. however this beer still maintained a bit of an earthy aroma. At 102 IBU I expected way more than I got..even at a warmer temperature it did not have that bite I was expecting/wanted. The carbonation of the brew coats the pallet with a lot of hops, a very good balance of carbonation to flavor is present in this beer. Hop Stoopid is a good sipping beer and at 8 percent ABV one or two bombers is enough. Id recommend this beer to someone who is just making that transition to IPAs or ESBs"
"Drinkability: For a one trick poney this one is pretty good. I would still grab a Ruination or Hop Wallop any day over this one but it serves it purpose nicely. Not sure how many of these I'd throw back as after glass 2 there's really no tasting anything else."
"D-Very nice DIPA with plenty of redeeming qualities. i like how this showcases hop flavor of pure hop bitterness."
"D: Highly drinkable for a DIPA. A tasty brew from Lagunitas and one I'll definitely look out for in the future."
"I thought their standard IPA was a good interpretation of the style but in my opinion, it doesn't compare to their DIPA offerings; this and Maximus. The balance in both beers is near perfect. This one seems like a slightly amped up version in comparison to their Maximus with more focus being place on the bitter character of the beer. I'll buy this one again and again."
"Good stuff"
"Bitterness has a little harshness to it. I am definitely curious what hops they use - Chinook? Columbus? Mouthfeel a little thin for the ABV, enhancing the harshness of the bitterness even more. They could improve the mash - either the schedule or the grain bill - something to give it enough body to support the bitterness and heavy pine/herbal flavors. Bear Republic actually does a great job of this."
"Yucatan-style grilled fish with mango and pickled onion"
"Overall a very enjoyable brew but it didn't seem to have the wow factor I've found with other hop bombs."
"D-as the beer warms i'm noticing much more earthy maltiness than I am crushingly bitter flavors...it has to be the age of the beer and it encourages me to seek out a fresher bottle in the future for comparison; the 8% is well hidden and even with a few months on it it is still a decent DIPA, but not great"
"Great DIPA!"
"paz!!!"
"D: this is a great value for a DIPA that packs quite the punch in the hop department. The highlight of this beer is the aroma. The taste is great, but doesn't deliver as good of balance as some of my other favorite DIPAs."
"Drinkability is amazing. A great hop bomb and thoroughly enjoyed this beer for the first time. A great West Coast DIPA, highly recommend."
"D: I could make a habit of getting Stoopid on a regular basis!"
"Value: $3.99 for a big boy bottle? Not too shabby. Wish I could find it in a sixer."
"Had this beer once before and was not impressed. That bomber must have been old because this one I'm drinking right now is excellent. Glad I tried this one again."
"Picked up a bomber from Abe's for $6.50 and split it with a friend. I have to say I'm kind of a fan of this beer. It's moderately priced and too strong (I prefer lower-ABV DIPAs). The aroma and flavor is dominated by piney hops with a hint of cinnamon and a bit of pineapple. There's also a sweet (maybe a little too sweet) caramel malt background. I'd like this beer a little lighter, but otherwise it's quite tasty."
"This is a good beer, but there are a handful of DIPAs I'd have instead of the Hop Stoopid. A great value, however."
"Medium body and medium carbonation. This here is one of my favorite DIPAs, hard to believe it is so inexpensive. I'm also impressed that such a flavorful DIPA is the product of hop extract. Lagunitas made it work and this came together quite nicely."
"Overall my first beer from Lagunitas was a pretty good DIPA, one of the best I've had to date. For the price I paid for it I would definitely get it again if I were looking for a DIPA. When I saw this the number of IBUs kinda put me off, but after manning up and buying it made me glad I did. It didn't taste nearly bitter as the IBU shows."
"A great American IPA! I doubt I could drink more than a pint or two of this in an evening, but though it is potent, the flavor is an enjoyable one. My first Lagunitas brew, and it certainly was a grand entry. Looking forward to more Lagunitas brews in the future..."
"My favorite DIPA or IPA in general that I have drank yet. For $4.50 a bomber this beer can't be beat. One of the best bangs for your buck when it comes to beer."
"Pours an orange colour with fluffy white head and nice lacing. Smell is bursting with citrus hops and some caramel sweetness. Nice bitterness in the taste, not overwhelming, but enough to notice it. Lots of hop flavour and a small amount of malt backbone for a hint of balance. This was my first ever double IPA that I tried, so I have a have a nostalgic love for it, but it is a really good beer."
"Notes: This is a solid hopy beer with nice West coast hop complexity. It is almost all about the hops so I would say that it is aptly named."
"It's always a joy to find a high IBU hopster that gnaws a bit on the enamel but also lulls with an apt grain vs. hop balance, and so it is here. The ABV is moderately brawny, but it pales as the blending produces an easy flowing beastie. See, you don't always have to be extreme to be bold and brassy."
"Prost!!"
"Alcohol is well hidden."
"It's not my favorite of the hop-holocaust varieties, but definitely compares well to any of them."
"Drinkability is good, especially cause of the price. I could down a few a night."
"Bottom line: one of the best Imp. IPAs on the planet. Easily holds it's own against DFH 90, and Pliny the Elder."
"D:This brew has that bitter taste that you would expect in something with over a 100 IBU's...and I'm loving it. Reminds me of some other IPA's that I have drank prior, very easy drinkability and definitly one I will drink again"
"Drinkability: Definitely a hoppy brew and one great for hopheads. It isn't the most complex brew as far as hops go, but it's still damn good and very affordable given the hoppy brews which may be better. Definitely worth a taste. I would definitely recommend this to any beer drinker with a developed palate, and would love to have this brew again."
"Had this one once or twice before but never reviewed it, either way I love that Lagunitas makes so many good hoppy beers for cheap. Pours a clear golden color with a decent white head that leaves nice lacing. The smell jumps out at you, with huge citrusy and piney hops, along with some honey, fruity esters, bread dough, chalk and alcohol. The flavor also has a big, juicy hop component upfront (notes of pine, grapefruit, pineapple), along with a honey sweetness, chalky astringence, fruity esters, bread dough and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is pretty good despite the hoppiness and ABV. Pretty damn solid DIPA, impressively fresh and juicy tasting and for a bargain basement price."
"D - It really is a great beer, I just wish the taste lived up to the aroma... enjoy this one, especially with the right food!"
"Very drinkable! This is one of the few beers in my never-ending """find beers I never had before""" quest that I would get again!"
"D - Very drinkable for the ABV. I barely taste the alcohol, the malts and hops do a good job hiding it."
"Shared a bomber this afternoon with a friend. Very, very good---the smell is amazing. This is about at the top of my range alcohol-wise, as I tend to find high octane beers unbalanced. This one was very easy drinking and if I didn't know it was 8%, I would have figured lower. Great hops taste and bitterness in the finish. Nice head to the bottom of the glass. You like IPAs, you owe yourself to try this."
"Drinkability/Palitability:Surprisingly high for 102 IBUs. Very refreshing on a warm summer night."
"Straight, I always find myself going back to it. Its unique to me. I haven't found any beer quite like it."
"D - Solid! If you want hops, you got em. Classic case of hop taste nicely the 8% ABV. Not for everyone, but definitely not just for the hop heads."
"Second tasting: There is a sweet malt thing going on here that in most beers of this alcohol level turns out to be overbearing, but in this one, there is enough bitterness to bring it into harmony. This is a really nice ale."
"I really like this. The hops and the malt work well together and the beer is clearly designed to showcase the hops."
"D - I'm a hop head, and remember this one being absolutely delicious the first time I tried it. Having re-lived the experience again, I was not surprised that it was just as delicious this time around. Recommended offering to anyone who loves hops!"
"Pored a clear, pale golden orange with a thick soapy and sticky offwhite head. Good retention, minimal lacing (bottle is a couple months old from my interpretation of the Julian dating). Aroma is very citrus and pine oriented, with some of the sweet malt detectable here. Lots of tropical fruits are here, I got some pineapple, mango and peach, but the list goes on. Taste is awesome, starts initially with the sweet and solid malt base upfront, gradually fading into a hop attack, where the flavour opens up and matches the aroma in terms of the tropical bouquet. Just so goddamn tasty. Mouthfeel is great; full, medium to low carbonation and a LONG lasting bitter and dry finish. By long, I mean that from the point I left my girlfriend's house (where we imbibed) to the point I got home, over an hour later this bitter, dry cottonmouth effect lingered. Don't mind this at all, and in fact was the first time I've ever experienced this effect. ABV is undetectable and goes down super smooth. Great stuff here."
"One of the best easy to find, relatively inexpensive DIPAs. Another hit from Lagunitas."
"This is a hoppy treat, the likes of which is not easy to find in Canada, especially Ontario, so I'm very grateful for receiving this one."
"D- great beer and a great value at less than 6 bucks. I love this stuff."
"D- solid double IPA, i was expecting to be overwhelmed with a beer called 'Hop Stoopid', goes down smooth"
"D - Perfect for a hot summer day. I would love to have access to this beer. Can't wait to get my hands on another one. Thanks to my brother in law for stashing it in his bag from Seattle."
"D - Very easy to drink this. If I got this thrown into a trade, would be completely satisfied! Thanks Scottfrie!!"
"drinkability - smooth and easy, very good hop character"
"Edit: about halfways through the bomber, I wanna add I also get a white peach flavor in the finish."
"Very good Imperial IPA with almost too much hops to have anything but bitter on the tongue. I think it is well balanced but I can see this not being for everyone. In fact, I think I would take the Lagunitas IPA (one of my favorite IPA's in the known universe) over this is I had the choice."
"I'm looking forward to adding a few of these to the beer fridge to have on hand."
"O: Best Imperial IPA I've ever had, I believe. Excellent."
"D: Very, very drinkable for this strong of an Double IPA. Loved it."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rough and rugged and it is surprising there aren't hop pieces in the beer. Drinkability is great for a iipa, easy enough with a kick."
"D: This lived up to the hype. It's a good DIPA, but to expensive compared to what I can get here."
"(I have noticed that after two 22oz bottles, you get hop-TARDED!)"
"This ale pours a very clear dark golden color with a clingy white head. The aroma is extremely hoppy -- fresh lemon rind citrus with pine and a bit spicy. The flavor is intensely hoppy and quite bitter -- yet decently smooth on the tongue. The beer finishes slightly dry with a lingering bittersweet quality, mainly hop flavor/bitterness with just a bit of sweetness. The carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall an intensely hoppy beer that is rather smooth and quite delicious. If you love hops and a punch of bitterness, you'll love this beer."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle (no bottle date) into a snifter glass. Pours a clear golden with good head retention and low carbonation. Smells of citrus, mango, grapefruit hops with a little pine and caramel. Tastes same as smell with more of the caramel with some toffee. Very smooth mouthfeel with a hop bite towards the end. Very well done beer that I will drink again and again."
"All in all, this was an excellent DIPA and one I won't forget. As far as the bitterness goes, I would have liked more."
"D - Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, in fact the best from Lagunitas that I've had. It doesn't mean this bottle won't take some time to drink through though. Well, I picked it for the night to sip at it anyway."
"overall: this is a hit it out of the park IPA one of the best IPA's out there. 1 drink leads to another a beer you cant put down its too good."
"Altogether a great beer, and a nice gateway to get back into American beer again."
"This wasn't the absolute hop monster I thought it might be, but it was an excellent beer. It delivered a great taste and hop character along with excellent drinkability for a very reasonable price (somewhere around $4.59 for the bomber, I think). This may very well end up being a go-to beer for me when I need a hop fix but don't want to destroy my palate for the night. Recommended."
"Despite the big ABV, i could drink a lot of this because it's so good if you like big double IPAs."
"For a DIPA this is a very drinkable beer with a good balance. Not to thick, not to thin."
"Simply Heaven to the Pallet... The name """Hop Stoopid""" is definetly an understatement of the massive collection of floral hops that blast you like a 9mm with your first taste. From smell to swig I was impressed down to the last taste. In a less politically correct world, this beer would be called """Hop Retarded""" Cheers!"
"D- It drinks easy. Not one of my favorite DIPAs but it was decent."
"Drinkability: Continuing on my ongoing quest to find killer IPA's and DIPA's, this one is a nice addition. Nothing stoopifying, but I enjoyed it."
"I agree with most that while it's a bitter beer up front, the malt sweetness really takes over mid tongue and continues to the back of the tongue and lingers. It's a fairly drinkable beer with all those IBUs thanks to sweetness of the (I'm guessing crystal) malt."
"I thought this was supposed to be about as hoppy as you could get, coming in at 102 IBUs, but it's actually not as hoppy as I expected. Yes, it's a hoppy beer but not overwhelmingly so, and I guess that's a good thing. Makes it much smoother and drinkable. The hops come through with a nice citrus/floral/pine burst but the malt is there, balancing it all out. Extremely drinkable, esp. given it's IBU."
"I tried Hop Stoopid on-tap before reviewing from the bottle, and I must say that I enjoyed it more the first time around. Maybe this particular bottle was on the older side...."
"Medium full body, with moderate carbonation. A little thick, and a bit chewy. Alcohol hidden well. Overall a solid Imperial IPA, though I wouldn't call it insanely hoppy. It has good punch, though, and maybe a bit more of a malt presence than most examples. Full flavored, and easy to drink."
"A fresh breeze through a pine forest with an undercurrent of citrus hops. Golden amber as if it were a standard of legends. The taste is an army of cedar/citrus hops barrelling down my tongue, applauded by a fanfare of grapefruit and smooth malt, finishing with an emphasis on the flavor of the hops and grapefruit. There is a pleasant tang upon the finish. Lightly carbonated mouthfeel, a pleasant tang of grapefruit to complement the hops. Wonderfully drinkable and well rounded."
"D - Extremely drinkable for the ABV. Nice balance and wonderful flavors. This is in my opinion the best bang for your buck DIPA you can get on the east coast."
"The name kind of gives the game away when it comes to the aroma and taste. This is another of those over hopped US beers that are all the rage for some reason. However this beer wasn't as bitter or dry as some I tried during my trip, it had a mellow sort of feel. A malt content seemed to be attempting to calm down the hops and I found it easy to drink. It wasn't the most refreshing beer I could have choosen to drink after walking, but I enjoyed it."
"Golden-hued, clear and somewhat frothy this Hop Stoopid is quite smooth and tasty. While this particular bottle smells a bit too much like canned corn, tangerine, apricot and mango hop flavors mix well with honey-like sweet malt finishing with a slightly dry peppery bitterness. A dusty cedar aroma emerges after a bit. I doubt that I have a fresh bottle, but it's still enjoyable. I'm astonished at how drinkable this beer is despite the 102 IBUs and eight percent alcohol. Again, it could be its age or I'm just thirsty. Maybe I should have a glass of water..."
"D- great beer would definetly buy again."
"Drinkability: Savoring every swig! I consume this kind of stuff like candy. I only rate it a 4 here because it's just right for the style, but it doesn't make any great strides towards being incredible... just very, very good."
"D - Very drinkable for an 8% beer. Well balanced. Definitely one of the better over 100 IBU beers I have had."
"D - A good beer, but the fruity malts overpower the hops in the smell and taste a bit too much for me. With so many good DIPAs out there, I'll easily look past this one in the future."
"o - great dipa, would buy it again. very drinkable. 8% is masked quite well."
"D: What a bargain! A sub-$4 DIPA that drinks like its $10 counterparts. I haven't had a Hop Stoopid in a while and I'm reminded just how good and easy drinkin this beer can be."
"Overall - Nice DIPA. Only negative is that the vegetal dry hop component may be a bit overpowering. Otherwise, really good beer."
"Overall this is a very drinkable DIPA and a great bargain at $4.99. Well balanced and hits the spot for hop cravings. I will be having this again."
"Drinkability: This is a deal if I've ever seen one. I can pick this up for $4.99/bottle (in PA nonetheless) and is a very enjoyable DIPA that I see myself putting away during these hot months."
"D - I especially love the cheesy """102 I.BU.4.U""" on the label... A unique and complex offering... Really is a hop stew... Above average and will fix any hop cravings you may have... Also should be noted that this is an outstanding bargain at $4.99 a bomber..."
"Drinkability - A great drinking experience and a very pleasant surprise! I already admire Lagunitas for the terrific quality/price ration in their products. This brew is a standout in the lineup. Very good!"
"Respect to Lagunitas for their experimentation. I'm not too crazy about hop overloads in general, but this makes for an interesting pour and a nice change of pace."
"Not a beer snob's beer by any means, but with a name like Hop Stoopid, you only expect one note. And that's what you get. Lagunitas delivers it like ZZ Top or AC/DC. They've only got one song, but it's a damn good one."
"D - Well if it's still around I can easily pick up another bomber for 6.50. Wish they were more available in more places here."
"Poured from a 1 pint 6 Oz bottle this brew is a straw yellow color that is tremendously clear with a 2 finger frothy white head that settles into a nice cap leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is sweetly full of hops. There is pine, citrus, slight earthy tones to the aroma. The taste doesn't disappoint. The flavor is sticky and crisp with floral hops up front finishing mildly bitter with pine and grapefruit. Could use a little malt to provide a little more balance. The body is slightly light with good active carbonation making the taste pop. This is a very good brew."
"Drinkability: A delight for hop lovers. This is right up there with Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA as a great example of the style. For a beer with 102 IBU's, this one is not overly bitter at all thanks to the great balance of sweet malts. A very good beer than is very easy to session with."
"Drinkability: very drinkable. This is one highly refreshing brew with a great bright flavor and just a marvelous aroma. Drinkability is surprising considering the high ABV ... this one can sneak up on you."
"While the bitterness is obvious, it definitely doesn't overwhelm. It allows the ho aroma and taste equal play in the end, which is a trademark of all my favorite IPAs. It definitely doesn't feel like 102 IBUs. Delicious beer."
"An excellent beer. If you enjoy IPAs, don't skip this one."
"I've heard quite a bit about Hop Stoopid, I was expecting to have the enamel on my teeth dissolved off but that was not the case. Still, a very solid, although one dimensional, DIPA. It doesn't have a bottle date, so it's hard to say how long this sat on the shelve."
"I was very happy in general with this beer. I look forward to trying more from Lagunitas."
" Very drinkable beer although this should be the closing act of the evening."
"The appearance is a clear, amber-orange hued golden color with a fair amount of off-white head. The nose is of very resiny hops with some nice floral and citrus accents. The flavor is again more very prominent pine oil flavors and citrus, grapefruit flavors. I particularly enjoy the resiny bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and with an enjoyable oily, mouth coating that I feel enhances the resiny flavor. This brew is incredibly drinkable, for which I am glad the ABV is not any higher or I would be in trouble. With the large availability of this beer, it could easily and enjoyably become my go to IIPA."
"Great googily moogily that's an awesome beer. Really glad I kept this in my cart."
"D: Will I finish the bottle? Sure. Would I have another? Well, no. This is palate napalm. It's delicious, but you can't expect to have several of these."
"Not drinkable at all."
"Drinkability: If you love hops (I do) than this is a beer you can drink all day."
"Notes: Great 22oz bottle at a great price and ABV. Good hops with a subtle malt profile."
"D: This is a very drinkable DIPA. The alcohol is barely detectable and the hop actually isn't too over the top, it is actually soft and smooth on the palete."
"D: Great in the bottle. Far superior on draft (and COMPLETELY different in my opinion). At 120 IBUs, it's no surprise that Hop Stoopid is the hop bomb/bitter bomb that it is. This one should be reserved for the truest hops heads only."
"D: The flavors are big yet subtle. I have had numerous other beers that I would describe as a """hop bomb""" and this is much more subdued. The name is a little misleading. I expected some crazy, out of balance, hop hammer. This beer is quite nice and I would definately purchase again although its not what i expected"
"Drinkability - a lighter DIPA and easily one of the most sessionable of the style. Delicious."
"pours a transparent copper-yelow color with a small amount of light fizzy head. good lacing and lots and lots of heavy fizzy carbonation. Heavy hop smell and taste as well as some hints of pine and floral, and possibly some oak flavor as well. slightly bitter in the finish and the flavor seemed to last for ever. i was very impressed with this beer, probably the best beer you'll ever get for this price, atleast IMO. one of the cheaper beers i have purchased and is probably in my top top 5 favorites. i could drink this beer everyday and probably never get sick of it. highly recommend this beer if you have never tried it before i suggest doing so."
"Overall, a very enjoyable DIPA that's quite easy to drink for the style. The hop profile is interesting, and not the pure citrus bomb that you often get with the style (not that that's bad). It's a little bit different, and so I praise it for that. I'll defintely buy it again."
"D - Nice and smooth; hoppy without overdoing it. This 22 was easy to take care of."
"All in all a very good beer, the 1st I've had from Lagunitas and I would like to try some more of their stuff. I'd buy this again. Definitely worth a try, especially for IPA/hop lovers. Good stuff."
"I bought two bombers of Hop Stoopid at a bottle shop in NJ after hearing about it. This beer opens and I could already smell the hops. The pour produced a nice fluffy white head of beer that slowly retreated to a solid skim of white. The color was a brilliant clear light amber and when drunk left good lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy and intense, and I caught a hint of sweet malt. Lagunitas has really outdone themselves with this beer.The beer has a decent malt backbone and a sticky thick mouthfeel. The flavor profile is intense and dynamic. The front end is piny, followed by a grapefruit middle and ended at the back of my tongue is a smooth bitter that only gets better with every drink. I am a fan of this beer and its price tag of $4.95 which seems to me to be a steal. I will be getting more of this beer next trip to NJ."
"Another quality pale ale from Lagunitas. For the price which you pay for a 22oz. ($3.50 - $5.00), this is a must try if you have an affinity for hops!"
"D - Very easy to drink. Not a trace of alcohol, and plenty of hop flavor without abrasive bitterness. Well done, Lagunitas."
"This is...slick tasting. Oily, isn't the right word, but it is not far off. Good dose of hoppy bitterness. IDK if it is because the bottle isn't off the assembly line, but not the smack in the face I expected. Not saying it is bad, just IDK, was expecting more punch. But this is good. The citrusy goodness is there all the way. You get some malt at the end, but there is more citrus after that This is a pretty drinkable beer, all thing considered, but don't go down 3 or so"
"you might just like it. it is different. and it is good."
"Very good, but I'd call it a beginner's double IPA - a gateway to the style (for what it's worth, it turned my wife into a hophead and she hasn't looked back)."
"D-Definitely not what I was expecting. Very well balanced although I'm somewhat disappointed that it's not more bitter. Very easy drinking though, and a very solid Double IPA."
"D- this is a fantastic example of a DIPA. It is very drinkable. It's hard to believe it's 8% alcohol. The grapefruit explosion makes you feel as though the brew is not too dangerous... but watch out. I highly recommend grabbing a few bombers of these. Great brew"
"Pours clear and light gold in color. Three finger white head with good retention and lacing. Smell is straight up citrusy west coast hops. Some grapefruit and pineapple with their touch of sweetness and a little bitter hops as well with a piney smell. Though the citrus is dominant. Taste was good. Surprisingly balanced. A sweet malt with a nice, dominating citrus sweet hop profile. Theres a pleasant bitterness thats not overwhelming. Honestly I was expecting it to be more bitter and found it very enjoyable and balanced. Mouthfeel was fine, slightly oily feeling from the hops but it was too much. Overall a great beer. The ABV is well hidden and the hops are just right."
"D - the most drinkable higher abv IPA I've ever had. Delicious. 5.0"
"Drinkability was good. Finished the bomber in one sitting and still had room for more. Was everything you'd expect in an DIPA. Only problem I had with the beer was that the bottle wasn't dated. There was no way to tell how fresh the beer was and I suspect mine was acouple months older than I'd like"
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable and super enjoyable beer, to me this is a fine example of the style and as my first lagunitas beer I am impressed, when you throw in the great price point on this beer its a home run, its a good solid hopped beer that maintains a long yet balanced finish, one I would be happy to drink all nite"
"D - Very drinkable, although for the price I feel there are better options"
"A solid beer overall, would go back for more."
"D: This is an excellent value. But I'm sorry to say that 90% of the time, I'll still pick up Pliny the Elder at the same price (even though it's a smaller bottle). Hop Stoopid is not a perfect substitute. However, I will say this: it's one of my gold standards for a high-value DIPA, and it makes me ignore those $8 and $10 bombers completely."
"For all the talk about this beer being one of the hoppiest, most intense double IPA's on planet earth, I found it to be surprisingly balanced and drinkable (particularly for an 8% ABV beer). Definitely worth a try, especially for the price."
"Drink this."
"D - Very drinkable beer and one that you should consider sipping as the alcohol profile is hardly noticed and will catch up to you. Great beer overall and one that I will add to my fridge rotation."
"Overall: Excellent DIPA with well balanced malt character. Pleasant, fruity tones round to 	an enjoyable, grapefruit, hop bitterness. Very drinkable without a prevalence of alcohol."
"D: An excellent DIPA that is dangerously drinkable, as is everything that I've had from Lagunitas so far."
"Overall, this is just a middle of the road double ipa. Its on the lighter side of the style like Stone Ruination. It would be a great starter ipa."
"A good beer but not great. A helluva alot of hops but seemed like it was covering up alot of the tropical fruitines and malts in this beer."
"Overall, very good. I still think with a name like """Hop Stoopid""" it should be hoppy-er and more bitter, with a possible higher ABV."
"D: Could drink this regularly, especially for the price. A nice underrated west coast brew."
"D - For 8% ABV, this is very drinkable. Great flavors and mouthfeel make for a great sipper."
"D - A nice DIPA. This one seems to be in the in between of an IPA and a DIPA."
"D: Very drinkable. Not the hop bomb I was expecting. The flavor is very pleasant and it goes down easy. I could drink this anytime."
"D - Average drinkability, which is to say around one pint. Bold beer, not much to say about it, hopped up with not much complexity, it's a hop fix for sure. Not bad, I don't think I'd buy this one again, I would probably stick to something more drinkable, as I'm not big on this style. Worth a try, but in my opinion, only worth seeking if your a big tropical fruit hop head! Cheers to all!"
"Overall a very good beer. I think I expected a little more punch from a beer called Hop Stoopid. However still a damn good brew, well done"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Smell was more malty than hops, but maybe because I was expecting huge stoopid hops, i didn't get that. Taste was hoppy, with big citrus, but I found this to be more malty than I expected, but maybe in a good way, allowing this beer to have a smooth mouthfeel and be very drinkable. Pick some up, good stuff, I just kind of think these guys were ahead of there time with the big hops, and now most guys are going over the top with the hops that these guys are kind of lost."
"This is very easy to drink, and the bomber empties pretty quickly. Reminds me a bit of Two Hearted Ale, nice and easy to enjoy, without peeling off your taste buds with a hop assault."
"Overall impression: My favorite cask beer of 2009 (working thru a backlog of reviews)."
"D - Tasty hoppy ipa which leaves me wants more. Just as good as I remembered."
"The mouthfeel is big up front with an oily slickness and a dry finish. The full bomber of this was a bit much for a lunch beer, and just like NYS said, it required a weekend nap."
"A good beer for its style, but overall a highly drinkable brew. Inviting, refreshing, and delicious. I could do a second bomber."
"D: While it may not be the hop bomb that others in the style are this should be appreciated by any fan of a good DIPA. The alcohol is well hidden and I could certainly throw back a few of these."
"edit- did I mention I got this at 7-11??? pretty cool and super cheap for the quality. 7-11 please carry more beers like this."
"I would give this beer 3.5 out of 5 stars"
"d - Thought this DIPA was pretty good. A nice ibtter taste and cirtusy smell and taste. Not as much hops as I would have liked, but very nice for the price."
"Poured into tulip, nice and light golden color with a decent sized white, foamy head. Looks to be a standard IPA. The nose hits hard on this one with intensely floral and citrusy hop aromas. I think I may love this hop extract. The taste, seems slightly bitter and very similar to the scent. This bottle may have been around awhile, as the hop flavor seems to be a bit subdued. Feel is light for a double IPA, also slick with an oily feel once consumed. Drinkability is above par on this one, alcohol content is also well hidden, making it that much better."
"On the whole this is a pretty nice, drinkable, and reasonably priced DIPA. Lagunitas is a more than solid brewery that really scores major points for keeping their prices respectable."
"One would be hard pressed to find an occasion where Hop Stoopid would be out of place. Simplicity has a hero, stooped as it is."
"Update: Found a bottle in the back of my cupboard that is more than a half year old. Aroma is still fantastic. Very hoppy and tropical. However, the hops have faded significantly from the flavor. It's quite sweet now. Flavors of tropical fruits as well. Alcohol seems a little more present."
"I'm starting to think there may need to be different classification for DIPA's because some are big bitter bombs and others like Hop Stoopid, are more tropical. I like the latter style better and will tend to look for more like this in the future."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable DIPA. I didn't have a problem with the bomber, but it might get a bit too sweet after awhile."
"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this brew. Using hop extract was not the correct strategy in brewing this beer, in my opinion. It's got some decent flavoring to it, but it's not very well put together, nor is does it feel very authentic. This would not be the first DIPA I would reach for."
"D - Pretty drinkable as it is a tad thin if you ask me. Not a flavor east coast hop bomb like a smutty big a ipa or even a southern tier unearthy but it is along those lines.. just a bit weaker... The price makes this one a great buy. I probably won't see this out again; however, the price is very right so i think it was well worth it.."
"CHHERS!!"
"D - Very drinkable. It has great taste and is light enough that I'd be more than happy to settle down for some march madness with a case of these niners."
"I suppose it lives up to what it says on the label. Lots of bitterness. Not the best IPA, and not my favorite, but I'd buy it again."
"OVERALL: Full disclosure - Lagunitas IPA and Lagunitas Maximus Double IPA are two of my favorite beers of all time, so I was expecting Hop Stoopid to be one of the best beers I ever reviewed. Unfortunately it ended up just being too sweet for me. I understand that's what happens with a lot of double IPAs, but I'm still looking for that perfect beer - a genuine double IPA that is bitter, dry and not sweet - this was not it. At the same time it is still an excellent beer, but sadly, doesn't meet the high expectations I had for it."
"Overall, I really wanted to like this beer because I love super hoppy Double IPA's. Not bad, but there are better out there."
"Closest thing to HopSlam that I've found, besides the Weyerbaucher Simcoe Double IPA. Pours a nice caramel color, with a thick 1""" head. Smell is of grapefruit, pine, and perhaps pineapple. Taste is bitter, citrusy, and some definite hops. It's very well-balanced though. The 8% is hidden well, and I'm sure I could throw back a few of these without realizing its strength. Would definitely have this beer again."
"This beer poured a gold color that had hues of red and orange in it. The bubbles were loosely laced, but definitely there and noticeable. The head was foamy and white, and held itself up longer than average. It smelled of piney and citrusy hops. My favorite! It's touted as having 102 I.B.U.4.U. Here it goes. Hop bitterness hits you up front with some fruity malt traveling behind it with a bit more bitterness lingering on the tongue. The alcohol is noticeable, but not obnoxious. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than average, but that's not always a bad thing"
"Some toasted malt sweetness is noticeable upfront and that quickly gives way to lots of hop flavor. There is a bit of citrus along with grassy and slightly herbally hops. Plenty of bitterness but not too much. One of my new favorite IIPAs and it is very well priced."
"D: Very tasty, I want summer to come, and I want a backyard bbq with some ribs..."
"D-About what I'd expect from an 8% abv DIPA. Nothing special here. My only issue is the high carbonation. That doesn't take away much from an otherwise very good DIPA"
"Overall, a solid brew. Was expecting a bit more from each characteristic, as it came highly recommended to me by a friend. Pours a nice amber color, but was expecting a bit more from the head, although it was still not bad at all. Smell was fairly hoppy, as was the taste, but I was expecting a bit more with the 102 ibus. Still a nice brew, just didn't quite reach the level i was expecting it to be."
"D - Over the long haul probably a bit high on the carbonation...give a bit of a bloated feeling. Think I could by burping this all night long...alcohol is on the high side too to be really sessionable, but it tastes so good, I'd be willing to give this a try. I've had this a number of times and every time it is enjoyable...a fresh Hop Stoopid is right up there with the best of them."
"Medium bodied, sweet and bitter, with a slightly oily mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Nice drinkability, and a good bargain. One of the better values on the craft beer market."
"I like that there isn't an astringent bitterness that lingers after. But, IMO, I think Hop Stoopid can benefit greatly from a little Simcoe in the dry hopping, if there isn't already some, and a thinner mouthfeel."
"Pours a clear golden with a white head falling off to a delicate lace. Aroma is citrus, pine, fresh hops very in your face hops, awesome! Flavor is super hoppy up front pine citrus with a nice balance of malty sweetness and a huge hoppy bitter finish. Awesome brew."
"Overall, it was pretty good, nothing special."
"D - Too piney for me to drink a lot of, but not to heavy, Could do more than one, but would switch to something else if given more options."
"Overall definitely a solid IPA, not my favorite, but I will probably sample it again."
"D: Not bad, but there's many other DIPAs I'd rather have. I think Ruination is only slightly more expensive than this and (IMHO) much better. I'm not really averse to the strong bitter hop finish in this brew, I just think it lacks enough fruity sweetness to balance it out."
"M, D- For fans of an IPA with a solid shot of additional bitterness, this is a good one at a bargain price. Good, but the tongue-stomping bitterness did not compel me to want to repeat it. Easily drinkable, but some bitterness fatigue may occur. This was tasted along side the Dugana, and at half the price, it showed rather well, but could use a bit more balance."
"Overall a great IPA. For the price this is definitely a great premium IPA that has a unique balanced flavor."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not quite the intense beer that I was anticipating, but it's very tasty none the less. Some people might be disappointed if you're looking for a complete hop bomb, but this is a good unfiltered tasting Double Ipa."
"Overall a good IPA. Lots of hops and good dry body. I feel it is very true to style and would go great with spicy fish tacos, or spicy tuna rolls."
"Skål!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"Poured a double deuce into my New Belgium globe. So start the Super Bowl of Lagunitas bombers. This beer pours a clear, bright copper with a bushy white head that leaves massive creamy circles all the way down the glass. I don't know what it is about a well-made DIPA's being the most attractive beer style. It seems like it is very rare to see a DIPA look like crap. The aroma is citrus mixed with a little pine and just a hint of pale malts. Definite notes of grapefruit pith, lemon, tangerines and freshly cut pine trees. The flavor is extremely one sided. Hops, hops and more hops. Big grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, and just a bit of mango. There is just a hint of biscuity sweetness coming through on the middle of flavor profile. Hop Stoopid finishes with a sharp hop bitterness leaving the palate screaming for another sip. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter then I had expected with a very light carbonation. To me, I think this is the best beer for the money. A double deuce of a 8% Double IPA for $3.99! You really can't beat that deal and for that price, I'll always have one sitting in my fridge."
"This is great beer, i'm really enjoying it so far."
"This is no PtE competitor. It is, however, a very nice beer for the price. $3.99 for 22oz. is tremendous value, especially when this beer is fresh. Worth a buy."
"D- Overall, the hop bitterness detracts slightly from the drinkability, since it is not quite balanced enough by the citrus or mouthfeel. Then again, this is a double IPA. A great beer."
"Overall- if you're a hop fan i would recommend you to try this but the hop stoopid label i was hoping for alil more. also it states something like 102 ibu's on the front of the bottle and i don't believe it. i feel like stone's ipa or bell's two hearted is alil more bitter than this. still not to shabby of a brew tho."
"Overall: Haven't had this for a long time and forgot how good it is. It actually tastes and smells quite similar to PtE but maybe a little more bitter and less floral."
"Body is quite rich, with moderate carbonation that could have been amped up a little."
"Pours semi-hazy and a light copper color topped with a thin creamy white head. The nose is bold aromas of floral and citrus hops. The drink is tart and bitter with sweet earthy hop flavor. There is also a slight malty background and fades into a vinous flavor through the finish, which ends gently and slightly warming."
"Very drinkable. My glass would be empty if I wasn't still lingering/pondering on what that spiciness is from."
"**Tasting notes from sometime this summer**"
"Earns a solid spot just below the top tier of IIPAs. Good value."
"Overall, I'm quite impressed with this beer. I had expected over the top hops and not much else. Turns out it's well balanced and hopped but not over the top. I'd drink it again."
"Drinkability? Well, one 22 ouncer is plenty eh, at 8%, and the hoppiness lingers well after the last sip, so I wouldn't even think of sessioning this, but it is a very enjoyable drink, if you like hoppy ipas."
"If you like the sweetness in this brew, seek out a Little Sumpin' Extra!"
"Drinkability: Goes down pretty easy, but I'm not craving another one when its gone."
"d- really nice drinkability, i'd drink this again, it's not your run of the mill dipa, it's got alot of flavors packed into one bottle."
"D: Highly drinkable, kind of disappointed I split this bomber with my wife, but that's what you get for marrying a hophead."
"Great beer for what Lagunitas is going for."
"Overall this is a good beer, dont think I would have ever guessed it was 102 IBUs and 8% ABV."
"I had been thinking about picking up this beer for a while and had always passed, but tonight it was time to give it a try. Brew poured to a nice golden color with what I perceive as red highlights. Good sized white head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma is fantastic; the hop aroma is simply fantastic with the citrus smell that highlights grapefruit. That hop mixes well with the sweet malt aroma, very inviting! The flavor, while good, does not live up to my expectations based on the nose. The hop flavor dominates with some very nice fruit like flavors, orange and grapefruit mostly, though I really thought they would linger longer on the back of the tongue. The malt is there but in my opinion it gives off too much of a sweet flavor, a little to much of a coying toffee flavor. Now I had not realized that this was a DIPA, it just did not feel like one as it seemed to be a little thin, I only realized it when I was looking here. Overall a fair brew at a good price point, I would get this one again mostly due to the nose."
"Pours a clear, copper color. One inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, citrus, and slight herb. Fits the style of an American Double/ Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight citrus, slight herb, slight grass, and slight caramel. Overall, a strong body and good blend. The flavors were individually strong and yet still well blended together."
"D-very well balanced for a double, not too aggressive as the name implies. a great beer to get someone you love hooked on hops."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I mean I have had several of Lagunita's beers before and I have not really enjoyed them. However, how can you go wrong with a beer called Hop STOOPID!!!! In my opinion, you'd be the stupid one if you didnt at least give this one a fair shot on your list."
"I'll give it a go when next years batch comes around. Maybe the piece I don't like won't be there."
"*Note: uses hop extract"
"Drinkability is a tougher call. I like it and will buy again, but man this is almost the anti-session beer. Well done!"
"Hop extract probably has a lot to do with both the strengths and weaknesses of this brew - but it makes it pretty unique among its peers. A great value."
"D- if you told me this was 8% abv, I'd call bullshit- kind of like a Pliny Jr but very respectable in it's own right... I could never go back to Long Hammer"
"D= Very very drinkable if you like APA, IPA or IIPA. I won't worry about the 8% ABV. Possibly too rich to go with a steak, might be nice with a juicy burger or a fruit dessert (cobbler, pie, etc)"
"Having never had this specific beer before, but knowing that I love the style, I will need to try this again to determine if I got a not-so-fresh bottle, or if I just dont care for the beer as much as I expected that I would. I have read reviews of other BA's that I know have similar taste as I who reviewed this beer with high marks and comments that dont necessarily agree with my experience, so I will need to find one that is guaranteed fresh and compare my experiences."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and it does a nice job of coating the palate. Drinkability was good as the 8%ABV isn't noticeable."
"Overall/notes: Another movie and beer night for me. The beer was really good, so was the movie. My second IIPA was a good follow up, and solidifies me as a fan of the style. Anyone with the same taste: check out his beer!"
"Poured in to a Duvel tulip. Deep orange color and plenty of head. Smell of floral and piney hop presence. The taste is unique for an Imperial IPA, in my opinion. It has a very bitter earthy flavor akin to unripened fruits. Not a bad drink at all and something to grab next time you see it - especially as it's only $3.99. All Hail Lagunitas for making such an affordable and tasty IIPA!"
"D - high except for the 8 %"
"Taste only isn't exceptional because they don't age well, drink within 80 days i'd say."
"Appearance has a nice golden amber color with a thin head. Smell having a sweet citrus hoppiness. Taste is like a bitter sweet grapefruit having a nice balance between the hop and malt with little alchohol. Mouthfeel is a good medium with low carbonation that makes it go down smooth. Being from Lagunitas I knew it would be a good one and it is."
"Poured into a pint glass, the color is a bit darker then most IPAs but not by much. Inch thick head that doesn't go away for a long while. Lots of chunky lacing. Smells of HOPS and grapefruit. A light sugary smell as well. Taste is explosive with tons of hops and small malt backbone at the end. The hops are intense and prick your tongue. Extremely delicious for any hop head. The mouthtfeel is great and drinkability is only brought down by the high ABV. A great example of an American DIPA."
"I could totally sit around and hammer these all day with no remorse. Would probably be a horrible idea seeing as the ABV is 8. Oh well, pour me another."
"It starts out with a fragrant evergreen smell, and the taste comes out like spruce gum. In this case, it cancels out the 8% alcohol leaving a happy astringent taste, and you have to wait till you finish the bottle and stand up to find out you just knocked off something stronger than Arrogant Bastard. This is the stuff you alternate with AB (not Anheuser-Busch) while sitting out in the sun enjoying the current economic slowdown. Buy cases and cases before you go broke because you lost your job."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for any hop head, it's a staple in my 'fridge as it's in my opinion one of the best beers for your dollar you can buy. After buying several 22 ounce bottles I simply buy by the case now."
"Fairly drinkable, but the bitterness is just a bit off-putting. Just a bit."
"Drinkability: Great on tap, great out of the bottle, and - yep - great on cask. This one retains all of the amazingness of the original, with the softness and warmth amplifying certain characteristics and muting others. It's a different take on a solid beer. Recommended in any capacity."
"D: Not my favorite dIPA by a long shot, but not the worst either. Just not bitter enough, though the bitterness has respectable staying power. One of the cheaper dIPAs I can find, so it's got that going for it."
"beware the 8%. it can catch up on you quick, i'd only have bomber. or if you're feelin like it's going to be a good night, double up! get one for a friend too!!!"
"Not sure if I'll pick it up again as I have a lot more other beers to try, but it's certainly recommendable."
"Was looking forward, won't go out of my way to circle back to you hop stoopid. It's not you, it's me."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a golden/orange with a thick, sticky head. The aroma is full of grapefruit and pine. The taste follows. The beer is pretty well balanced, sweetness up front with a lingering bitterness to follow. It has a sticky, full bodied mouthfeel. A sipper to be sure, but a tasty sipper it is."
"Drinkability:I really enjoy something in many of the Lagunitas brews. This was pretty easy to drink in a sitting and very well priced. I'll definitely enjoy this one again along with many of the other cheap tasty Lagunitas 22 ouncers."
"Overall, a darned good representation of its type."
"D: Very solid brew full of citrus and pine. Flavors are full and the taste is refreshing. One of my favorite beers that I will continue to drink for years to come."
"Appears a pale glazed orange copper hue with a bright white head filling the rest of my chalice nice retention head simply clings to all edges of my glass leaving some chunky lacing with each sip that spreads nice and even between periods of imbibing. What can I say I love SoCal music and there's a band called Slightly Stoopid who have the whole reggae vibe, I could picture these guys from Lagunitas really digging their albums like Chronchitis it's almost like the Censored ale aka the Chronic. I don't know who inspired who, but let's smell this brew. Full on herbal goodness in the nose a bit of Cali kind bud pungency if you ask me but it's a nice ball of citrus herbal and grassy tones that give it a real balls out hop extract nose. Flavor is again pungent with hops a concentrated version of hop bitterness, pine, citrus, and floral tones burst together into one cohesive force of hops. Bitter blanket of alpha acids with a nice sweetness underneath finishes pretty dry with bitterness, as mentioned before priced very affordable for us hopheads. I've tried this beer for the last two years prior and have always been impressed but this may be the first year for the hop extract version. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with the hop oils really coating the palate it makes you breathe burp and smell hops in between sips, a new experience that I won't forget soon. Drinkability despite the intense flavors and textures this beer delivers on the drinkability factor it pulls it off for sure keeps me interested the entire time, a beer I would love to drink more often I'll have to set it aside as a special occasion hop harvest brew even though it holds up nicely well into December."
"Had this one at the Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood Ohio. Poured from 22oz. bomber into 12 oz. snifter. Strong pine hop aroma. I prefer my DIPAS with a little more malt balance. This beer has high reviews but I wasn't that impressed with my initial tasting. I will defintely give this another shot and do a more thorough review."
"D- Goes down pretty easy considering how hoppy it is. Great IPA, but not a favorite. Awesome bang for the buck will have me coming back again."
"This beer is very good for the price. I will buy again."
"D- Totally drinkable. Really a nice beer, easy to drink. I could session this without tiring of it. I sort of thought this would be more in-your-face with the 102 IBU's, but it's a very nicely balanced beer. This is really an enjoyable beer."
"D: For the style, a great example and very drinkable. As a session beer, this would suck, but that's not the purpose of a double IPA."
"Poured a clouded off orange color with good carbonation and a nicw hite fizzy head. Nose is big hops, lots oils, pine and floral, lots of malt too. Big hop oil taste, pretty nice OG on this and the hops were fruit and floral. Big and husky. Pretty bug IIPA on heavy side and bitterness on the end but cant believe it was 102 IBU."
"Seriously one of the best American IPAs I've tasted."
"OVERALL: I really enjoyed the taste profile on this one. Not quite as bitter as I'd expected, as the malt sweetness did well to balance everything out. A very enjoyable and drinkable DIPA to say the least. Unfortunately the thinner head and palate kept this from being world class in my books, but I won't let such nit-picky little things stop me from getting this one again if I see it. Recommended."
"Lagunitas seems to be my favorite brewery lately, but I prefer the Maximus or Little Sumpin' Extra over the Hop Stoopid."
"D- This by far the best DIPA I've had to date. An extremly easy drinker, it's really refreshing and it keeps you coming back for more."
"even though it isn't really a shining example of the style this beer is quite tasty and refreshing. the bottle claims 102 ibus, but the beer retains a balance that lies your mouth. really good beer."
"The 102 IBUs are pretty mild here. A good beer but just not as complex as something like a Dreadnaught. Still this is super mild for its strength."
"Overall this is a pretty nice DIPA with a great price point ($4.99/bomber), but there are many others that I would prefer over this. I am interested to see if my bottle was fresh or not, but I will not necessarily seek it out. Worth a Look."
"for $5, 22oz. beer it is good for the price, but nothing to write home about."
"Awesome hopness in a glass. Very drinkable and refreshing. Love it."
"Notes: Amazingly drinkable for a double IPA. I do like my hoppy beer, but this is so well balanced that it really stands out."
"D-so delicious, its like sweet grapefruit juice in my mouth that also gets me drunk!"
"D: A bomber along should be enough. When fresher this one does go down very fast"
"D - I love this beer. To me a great blend of ale tradition and American craft imagination. I will pick this up often."
"overall a very great brew...price is great and the whole package works well..another solid one from the folks at laguinitas"
"Libation: The bottle boasts 102 IBU, and the hopy bitterness is certainly there, but this is a very balanced brew. At times even quite sweet, very drinkable for DIPA."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Bright orange color with at least a solid inch of head. Wonderful aroma of hops and pine syrup, with of course the usual grapefruit at their side. Taste is a little lighter than I was expecting, with a lot of citrus-fruity flavors. It starts out very fruity with some hints of canned peaches but finishing out on the bitter end with more hops. This isn't as big of a hop bomb as the smell suggested but it still has a decent punch. Very tasty with only a slight alcohol presence, this a pretty solid drinkable DIPA if not the most powerful or unique."
"D- I will drink this beer again. Lagunitas has once again made a great beer. The price was not too bad either."
"Medium-full body. Very smooth drinker, without a hint of the 8% ABV. Dangerously drinkable. A bit of a slick, oily temperature."
"D: Quick drinkable considering that the alcohol is nearly undetectable, the mouthfeel isn't coatingly bitter like something such as SN Torpedo. I love the nose and this mouthfeel; even though I like Torpedo."
"This is a good beer, not a great beer. Sight, smell, and fine carbonation are a plus, but the taste is a bit uneven. Overall it's good with the nicely realized hops up front, but somewhere in the background there is a hint of warm marshmallows. Odd, I would say. Another weird taste I found was a hint of orange marmalade on toast. Also a taste of fruit/orange pastry dusted with a hint of powdered sugar. I like orange marmalade on toast and I like a decent pastry here and there, but I'm not sure that's what I want from a beer. If you like a bold, slightly syrupy, citrus fruit tasting drink, be my guest. Or, just mix an Old Fashioned and cut out the middle man. This would be good on pancakes, or served with pancakes. Breakfast beer, maybe?"
"Mouthfeel is full. This is a big beer, this shouldn't be surprising. It is highish in alcohol without being thin. A good, health mouthfeel and I give it points for that. Drinkability is high, about as high as a DIPA can go. Well done, check it out DIPA fans."
"There are hoppier double IPA's, but this one is smooth, well balanced and dangerously drinkable. No wonder so many Hop-head's kept coming back to my table for samples..."
"easily drinkable for a DIPA. Hop Stoopid is a beatifully made beer, one that fully satiates my hop itch at bargain."
"Tastes pretty much like it smells but there is a little malt that comes in and out of the continuous attack of the hops. Not the hoppiest beer I've had but it's up there."
"Overall: Terrific beer. It's definitely stronger and more flavorful than the normal Lagunitas IPA, but it doesn't go overboard and completely blast your taste buds."
"I can easily recommend this beer to anyone. It's an easy-going, straight-up DIPA. I think this is one of the best values on the shelves in my local store at $5 for a bomber versus the $8-9 for other DIPAs."
"D- This is a good one, lots of great hops and a smooth drinking DIPA. I was thinking this one might be a little more bitter or have some more bite than it did but I liked it all the same. Another good offering from Lagunitas."
"Overall a decent DIPA, i can imagine it being better super fresh and on tap. Imagine if orange replaced where the grapefruit usually is in WC IPA, and this is kind of how i feel about this one. Solid enough, but not one i would buy on a regular basis. Definitely worth a try, especially if you know its fresh (some bottling dates already please lagunitas?)"
"D: Tasty, alcohol hidden well, hoppy and good. I will purchase this again. Another good beer from Lagunitas."
"One of my favorites from Lagunitas so far. I love those sweet and cirtusy hop flavors they managed to bring out. Quite delicious and surprisingly easy drinking. Not to mention at ~$5 a bomber a price I feel to be more than adequate for this product."
"Lagunitas has a hands-down winner in Hop Stoopid. If you're a fan of big hoppy beers, this is the beer for you. It pours a nice sticky lacey head and the color is a nice hazy orange. But it's the beautiful hoppy citrusy aroma and taste that makes this beer great. Best served chilled but not too cold, in a wide mouth glass so you can stick your nose down in there and enjoy the nice floral notes of the hops. This beer tops out at 102 lip-smackin' IBUs. A great big hoppy brew and a bargain at $5-6 for a bomber. Go get Stoopid!"
"I am surprised that this aggressively hopped beer is more balanced then expected. The amount of bitterness is excellent and not overwhelming. Extremely drinkable, and only slightly palate scraping. Highly recommended."
"I don't think Lagunitas can make a bad beer, but I was expecting more."
"D: Definitely a great example of an Imperial IPA, wish these came in bigger bottles"
"This is one heck of an IPA. I love it. It reminds me of Centennial IPA from Founders BC. Very smooth, big, yet easy to drink and extremely well balanced for such a hop bomb. I will definitely have to get more of this. Lagunitas can do no wrong. Keep up the good work! Highly recommended!"
"I will definitely buy this again."
"Will buy again."
"A nice and lush juicy flavor here. Pineapple first comes to mind. A malt backbone is noticeable too but given this brews name it's not a really big part of the show. The 8% alcohol is hidden well in the flavor but does creep up on you as sips continue. Expected a bit stickier of a finish (we all know how the big hop brews can coat the throat) but this finishes fairly fresh and clean."
"A bitter husky hop flavor is way bitter on the front end, with a rush of lemony citrus in the middle of the character. A little on the bitter musky side for me, but not bad. It's not as complex as I had hoped, with the hop profile being very straightforward and not as balanced as I had hoped as the whole flavor leans towards way bitter. Not bad, but not as full and interesting as many of its brothers."
"D - So much bitterness limits this brew here... More than a bomber and your tongue will fall out."
"With a 102 IBU, a punch in the face was (enthusiastically) expected, but instead, I was met with a much more balanced brew. At times, a bit too sweet for me, but still quite tasty."
"Easily, and dangerously drinkable. Long live the cask!"
"Bomber bottle. Pours a golden yellow/orange colour, with a slight haze. Taste of hops and grapefruit bitterness through out. So damn smooth. How is this 8%? You got to be kidding me. I really enjoyed this beer, and will definately be buying it again. Prefer this over the Maximus anyday."
"D: Drinkabiltiy on this beer is good. The alcohol is not very noticeable, and it is quite smooth."
"Brown bomber - no bottled on/best by date. Purchased at Leary's Fine Wine (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2678) on 10/14/09, drank the same day. A vigorous pour into a tulip produced a thick, creamy head which gradually died down to leave a thin veil with heavy lacing. Bright copper color, good carbonation, clear, well settled sediment left in the bottle. Big hop nose, specifically citrus and pine. Taste is definately hop forward, fresh, grapefruit and pine, backed by a great malt structure, more malt comes through than I was expecting from a beer with this name, maybe this isn't as fresh as I had hoped. Pleasant bitterness but very balanced if not malt heavy. Good, full mouthfeel, nice carbonation, nice lingering hop finish. Very drinkable, I will definately buy this beer again, could drink a few of these with no problem."
"Light mouthfeel, surprising for a nearly 9% a.b.v. IPA. Carbonation was also milder than I had expected. Grapefruit, citrus, pine, dominate. This is an interested brew, but I just don't think it lives up to its fellow West Coast IPAs from Stone, AleSmith, RR, et al. Because of their prevalance, I probably won't buy this one again. Could be worse, but certainly not exceptional."
"Drinkability: You're probably thinking why I gave the drinkability such a high score. How could I not? Not only was it hoppy, but there was also a great deal of pine in this beer. There's that and the fact that it's cheap. I've seen bottles of this great beer below the $5 price mark. If you're one of the few people that are mad that they used hop extract instead of real hops, then you should really get a life."
"D: With 102 IBU on tap, I was expecting a wall of mouth puckering bitterness. Instead, I got a wall of hop flavor without the overwhelming bitterness. A very nice DIPA."
"salud!"
"A well executed double IPA. I'd give the nod to Pliny, but at least in bottles they're in the same league."
"D- about as good as you can get for a DIPA. this one falls in the easy drinking smooth category. I usually save the perfect 5's in this category for the OMG I can't get enough kind of beers. 4.5 is a solid score here considering 8% isn't huge for the style."
"This is a big beer, had to take a nap after this one. 22 oz bottle to glass. Amber color. Nice juicy fruit aromas, some citrus and pine. Big flavors, sweet malt on the attack, a bit of bright citrus, and that big, bitter finish. Was a bit difficult to drink a bomber of this, although I thought it was well made and had good balance."
"D - Yes, very nice drinkability. I could have several of these without much problem. I wouldn't call it a session beer but definately a beer to have again, and again."
"Jordan."
"D - A great Imperial IPA, I was completely into this beer - a great product which differs for the better from the cask IMO. I really feel this shines in bottle form - I hope I get to try this on draft, highly recommended."
"will try to avoid the repetitive description (amber color, lacing, grapefruit aromas) and just say that this is a fantastic beer. was a little worried that the hop profile would be too intense and leave my tastebuds decimated (Wet Hopsickle, anyone?) but this really does have nice balance while still being hop-forward. the 8% abv is at the perfect line where you know it's an agressive beer but you can still enjoy multiple pints/bombers without falling out of your chair. definitely seek this one out."
"Drinkability: great beer. definitely will be drinking this again. easy drinking for a DIPA."
"Honey orange with a nice dollop of cream colored airy fizz on top that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is pure hops, tropical fruit and pine with a touch of malt. The hoppy taste is good, bitter and well complemented by malt sweetness but make no mistake this beer is hop forward. Hop oily and medium bodied with bright carbonation. Finishes bitter and kind of salty but in a really good way if that makes sense. I thought that at the insane 102 I.B.U.'s this brew would have a more harsh bitterness than it does. This stuff is great, I wish I had another one."
"A worthwhile American IPA. Tasty, full flavored, but not overly belligerent with the hops resulting in a brew that is very easy to drink."
"Easy to drink, tasty, not the hop bomb I thought it would be, almost a bit to malty."
"I've had Hop Stoopid several times now and I'm always impressed with it. A very nice West Coast style double IPA at an EXTREMELY good price point. $4.50 for a bomber??? You gotta be kidding me!!! Amazing value and a top notch beer. I'd have this permanently stocked in my fridge if I could pick it up easily."
"Drinkability: Its decently drinkable, 102 IBU's is pretty high for not seeming too bitter, has 8% abv and drinks like 6.5% does have a slight warming qualities. Its pretty good id probably get it again."
"Overall: They saved their ass by calling it an ale because this drinks nothing like a DIPA considering the IBU's. The abv is up there but the taste is not something that begs me to drink let alone buy it. The price point is a redeeming factor but given other options I may or may not revisit. I still think this HAS to be labeled wrong I mean 120 IBUS and 8% yet its easily sessionable and leaves NO trace of big boy bitter at all."
"This a really good DIPA. I look forward to picking this one up again."
"Drinkability: Delicious but potent in flavor and ABV. Best as a treat."
"poured into my tulip glass. pours a light copper color wirh a 1/4 inch white head that fades rather quickly. nice stick lacing throughout down to the very end. aroma is that of floral hops and malt, taste is smooth and not real bitter, slight malt and grapefruit undertones. this beer is really really fucking good, great aftertaste, it is clean and hoppy. lagunitas, wtf? you make great beer!!"
"Hoppy flavors all over this one; it's a bit like an orange creamsicle from the growler. I think I remember a bit more bitterness from the bottle - and in either form it's outstanding. There is some sap/resin, cannabis oil, and grapefruit notes, but really the smoothness and generally full (for an IPA) body leave this one too sippable to both with specifics. Solid brew."
"Pours a golden color with a one finger head that gives way to some ok lacing. The beer is slightly hazy with very little visible carbonation. The aroma is of floral hops with citrus notes to it, there is a very small clove smell present. The taste is very smooth, there is a floral hop taste over top of a nice malt backbone, there is a little citrus flavor present as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability is very high, the alcohol content is completely hidden, even though some doubles are higher in apv. The taste is not biting or stingy like some double's tend to be. Overall this is an ultrasmooth drinkable beer."
"At this price point ($6.96/22oz) it's hard to beat this choice. I'm a fan of the Lagunitas brews and this one is no exception. Even putting a few in the cellar."
"D: An amazing DIPA, Laguintas deserves tremendous praise for this offering! The flavors came together in a wonderful bouquet that really delivered a great brew. I'm going to have to venture into more Lagunitas brews as my palate clearly has a taste for them. One of the best DIPA's out there, a must try for all beer lovers."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable. I have scored on the last two DIPA's I've tried (Yulesmith last night now this tonight). Not as good as the Yulesmith IMO but almost right there with it. I will seek this out again in the future to change things up."
"The mouth feel is moderately heavy since this is a fairly big beer, but it finishes dry. I'll have no problem finishing the bomber."
"D- Very drinkable... very recomended. Like this beer because it gets to the point. Make hoppy beer drinkable... thats it. Will get one for my brother when i go to North Carolina this weekend."
"Overall a nice looking DIPA that is pretty balanced when you get to the flavor dept. Nice fine and perky mouthfeel really makes this easy to drink. The scent is very unique, but one that I don't particularly 'dig'. Glad I tried it and might buy more if I come across it on draft."
"Bottle from OTM into a pint glass. Pours light amber with a nice hazy head that hangs around. Scent is not a strong with hops as I expected, but rather pleasant nonetheless. Taste leads with a strong hoppiness, not too much malty sweetness to speak of, leads into some bacon-y meaty flavors with a medium astringent finish. Overall a solid hoppy dipa."
"D - Moderate to high drinkability for a DIPA. ABV is well hidden, not filling. This beer will sneak up on you. Flavors aren't overwhelming for something called """Hop Stoopid"""."
"Poured a burnt copper orange with minimal white head. Smell hoppy with a lot of citrus, some grapefruit, a little bit of pineapple perhaps. Minimal pine. First thing I taste is the bite of the hops, bitter up front. In back, there is some malty sweetness to it. A lot of citrus and a little bit of pine as well. For how high of an IBU it has, not super duper bitter. Dryness not extremely high. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation. Effervescent. Drinkability is very high, especially for 8 % ABV. """Stoopidly""" drinkable as many would say."
"D - Pretty high for a DIPA."
"You just can't beat a fresh Hop Stoopid. Not around my parts anyways."
"Overall a strong offering and a far better brew than Maximus. One of my better liked DIPAs as of yet."
"Ample amount of carbonation helps lift the sweet flavors and bring you back for more. I am really impressed by this one was expecting a bit more of a hop bomb, but still more than enough hops."
"Poured this into my beer tasting wine glass. the appearance is a dark straw color, decent white fluffy head with slight retention and good lacing. The smell is favoring pine tar to citrus. The taste is again favoring pine tar with the malt balancing it out with fruit notes. The mouthfeel is a little sticky. One bomber of Hop Stoopid is plenty. It seems like it could get overly bitter after draining a couple."
"i have given this brew a few chances, and i hate to say i probably wont visit this brew again. lagunitas has impressed me with quite a few of their beers and im sure id rather their maximus ipa to this. not for me. though i wish it was."
"The initially poor appearance of this beer disappointed me from the get-go, but once I stopped looking at it I was duly impressed. Verging on novelty-bitter at 102 IBUs, there is plenty of malt to back up the hops, and the end result is fairly well balanced. I will most definitely return to this brew, it would be a great accompaniment to some strong food."
"MF/D: Pretty dry and bitter, long bitter finish, medium body"
"Hop Stoopid. Yup..."
"Cheers!"
"Nice amber color with a voluminous white head that seems to last forever. It was ages before the lace broke up on top and there was a significant amount of bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Seriously one of the nicest looking beers I've had in a while. Strong grapefruit aroma and maybe a hint of some floral notes. Tastes like a bite out of a fresh, juicy grapefruit with a nice, snappy bitterness. The dryness is quick and everlasting and leaves me wanting more. The bitterness and alcohol are definitely strong but certainly not overwhelming. While it's definitely on the packing a punch end of the scale, it still manages to stay in balance enough to be a highly enjoyable. Not the best IPA I've ever had but definitely very good."
"This is not where you would want to begin your journey through IPA's but it might be where you finish it"
"Drinkability: The 8% ABV is well-masked, but the hop bitterness is so overdone, that almost any other brew will be flavorless when consumed following this beast. This beer, while enjoyable, will almost always be a one-and-done for me."
"This is an extraordinary value compared to other brewery's offerings for DIPAs. Hop Stoopid is readily available to me at $3.99 a bomber, and often less, compared to others' at $4.99 to $6.49."
"aroma! make that 5 !"
"From a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a hazy orange color with a nice big white head. The head goes down to about one finger and has decent retention and leaves ok lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is very hoppy, mainly getting pine and citrus upfront. The taste was good. Pine hops first followed by citrus then dominated by grapefruit. Kind of bitter, in a good way. Very hoppy. The kind of IPA I love but not an everyday IPA. At an 8% ABV it isn't noticeable at all. A great IPA, and at a decent price I'll pick up another bomber from time to time just to enjoy."
"Buy one if you get a chance, it's worth it."
"drinkability is real high with this one a perfect DIPA"
"Very easy to drink, I barely noticed the alcohol in this beer, this could easily get one to act hop stoopid!"
"Mouthfeel is okay, sudsy, light, chewy. Overall it's a pretty swell brew- needs a little more tinkering, but at around 5 or 6 bucks for a bomber, and a pretty good hops fix? It's in the win column."
"Pours a golden, hazy amber color with frothy head that settles quickly and laces the snifter. Aroma is very powerful with lots of citrus hops up front. Also lots of of sweet caramel and bready malts. Taste is right on spot. Alcohol is well hidden by this beast. Taste is sweet and smoth with subtle hints of bitter hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and good carbonation bubbles from the base. Drinkability is very high due to the phenomenal taste. Great brew from a well respected brewery."
"D: This did not disappoint and am looking forward to having more."
"Drinkable for a DIPA once you get past the first one. At $4.30 a bomber it wouldn't become a staple at my house, but it is good."
"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy golden-orange with a creamy, white, half-inch cap. Decent head retention, followed by a central, light skim of foam and some thin, delicate sheets of lacing around 3/4's of the bowl. Nose reveals sweet grapefruit and perhaps a hint of caramel or toffee in the mix. Sweet character is somewhat diminished in the mouth, however still present. Some citrus astringency up front, followed by a piny/resinous, slightly medicinal quality in the middle, and finishing with some sweetness, and a lightly lingering bitterness at the end - not getting too much of a suggestion of malt throughout, although its presence is definitely detectable. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied with carbonation that is slightly prickly on the middle of tongue, but picks up towards the finish. Easy drinking with a balance that leans slightly more towards the bitter side of the style, but not in an off-putting manner. ABV is well-hidden at 8% as well. Also, can't beat the price - I think I paid $3.99 or $4.99 for a bomber. I haven't had too much from this brewery, but definitely a quality offering."
"Bottle: Poured a bright orangey color ale with large foamy head with great retention and perfect lacing. Aroma of floral hops with great notes of grapefruit. Taste is also a very well balanced mix between some floral hops with citrus and grapefruit ester with a subtle bitter finish. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no signs of alcohol. What a surprise and what a great mix between slightly sweet malt with great hoppy presence while not overtaking the beers and more profile then just bitterness."
"woah... boy is this a hop bomb! smell is STRONG pine hops. some tiny citrus notes that are hidden underneath all this pine hoppiness! taste is the same.... HOPPY from start to finish. almost impossible for me to pick up the tiniest malt notes on the tongue at the finish. bottle says ibu 102. i was prepared for some extreme bitterness but it was more than tolerable. drinkability is amazing for such high ibu and abv. i WILL buy this again... maybe later today."
"D: Definitely a bitter hop bomb, but still a great beer and pretty easy to drink."
"Easy to drink, well-balanced, and hoppy as a bunny in heat."
"This brew will definitely give you sensory overload, as it is definitely aggressively hopped. That being said, I'd hesitate to call it a hop bomb because there is a ton of hop flavor, not just bitterness. There's also a bit of sweetness, so at the end of the day there is a ton of flavor to enjoy here, and it's the lack of those things that characterizes a hop bomb, in my opinion. This is just a super hoppy, tasty brew. I will definitely pick more of this up in the future, especially considering it's a bargain price."
" ~ It's a good thing this bad boy comes in a bomber. If it were a six pack I'd not sure I'd make with all this hops. Either way, you should do yourself a favor, and get Hop Stoopid."
"Pours a golden/orange tint amber with a pillowy head. Grapefruit, citrus, and floral hops greet your nose saying, """hi there, let's get to the drinking already.""" Crisp medium bodied refreshment, well balanced between the hops and malts, with just the right amount of alcohol. Effervescent but not overpowering, you can drink these all day...I did!"
"D - This is a great DIPA. The grapefruit flavor is great. Can't wait to grab some more!"
"Mouth is oily and a tad overcarbonated but really a great offering for 3.99 a bottle."
"D-Easy to drink and I couldn't be ahppier about being able to get this...Oh wait yes I could I can get it as 3.99 a Bomber!"
"22oz bomber served in a shaker pint glass. Pours a clear gold with about a finger of tight bubbled white head. Big hop aroma, pine, citrus. Also some sweet malt. Taste is what you would expect from a beer that touts its 102 IBUs! Had a bit of a green, vegetal flavor from the hops that lowered my score a bit. Good malt base for all the hops. Drying mouth pucker from the hops. Medium bodied. Solid DIPA, but when you consider the price ($4 for a bomber) it's a winner."
"This is a good beer with a hint of bitterness in it. If you like IPA's this is a good one to not pass up on. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"I found this bomber for $4.50. I enjoyed it more than most beers on which I would spend $10-$12. This is one of the best values I have ever come across."
"Overall, I'm glad I finally got a hold of some of this. It's one of my friends' favorites and he's been raving about it for a while. A really good DIPA with reasonable ABV. Some DIPA's put you to sleep, this one is just right."
"great beer, really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, very affordable. Great to have this be my first DIPA."
"Notes: This is a recurrent favorite in my cellar-fridge. For a DIPA the price-quality ratio is almost unbeatable. Great beer in a nicely priced bomber. It may lack some of the maltiness and body complexities of say a Maharaja, but does make up for them with a very well crafted and aromatic hoppiness around a very rich, refreshing and drinkable experience."
"D -- eh... I'd probably purchase again but can't ever see myself drinking more than 22oz or 2 pints at a bar. As has been mentioned before, the lack of complexity can become boring quickly."
"I would say that the bitterness level tastes subjectively like what would be expected in a single IPA rather than the double that this is listed as. The alcohol level also could fit within the higher end of the single IPA range."
"Pours a clear amber with a two fingered head (depends on how you pour it), that quickly disappeared. Aroma was the usual suspect: Citrus. The taste I found tended more towards sweet lemon, instead of the typical grapefruit. And for the hopheads, some pine needle bitterness at the end. Feel was light to medium bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was good (note: my attention span is usually waning by the time I get to drinkability, and the beer doesn't help)."
"Bomber. Pours clear copper with a nice off-white head. Good lacing. Smells of typical C-hops, with plenty of citrus character. A bit of pine and some hemp as well. Sweet malt in the background. The aromatic hop character is similar in the taste and gives it a pronounced bitterness. In sharp contrast, there's a heavy sweet side to it as well, with a lot of biscuity malt. The finish is bitter, but not dry. Medium body. Not really a fan of the sticky sweetness."
"Relatively light bodied, leading to superior ease of drinking. My only real qualm with this beer is that the flavor doesn't live up to the nose, but it's still fantastic, and one of my favorites."
"Wow. If you love hops, this was made for you."
"Balanced, no, but definitely drinkable. A must for all hopheads."
"Drinkability: One bomber is enough to put a person over the edge. An intense and complex, imperial IPA thats a great deal at a 3-4$ bomber. Now the tough decision is to decide whats better the 90 minute IPA or this. Hmmm"
"I just love this; a phenomenal DIPA, highly drinkable, with a great price tag."
"Loads of hop complexity here, awesome aroma, nice balance. Very high quality DIPA from Lagunitas. Definitely worth seeking out."
"This is a touch one-dimensional to be in the top tier of imperial IPAs, but it is incredibly drinkable. I'll still be buying these guys whenever I see them."
"Tons of juicy fruity hops, but not much else. Could use way more bitterness, bite, pine, and resin in the finish, would really help round things out."
"Overall, the balance is pretty good although definitely slanted toward the hops favor. This is definitely an enjoyable beer."
"A pleasant aroma that clung to the nostrils with each sip. Mostly pine but slight citrus tones. Surprisingly mellow for a strong IPA. Any initial bitterness faded quickly and the overall mouthfeel came across with a very smooth texture, pleasing to my tongue."
"Appearance was a nice amber/orange; very appealing. Smell was what I want from this style: bitter, citrus, and pine. Taste was fantastic. A very yummy, smooth-for-an-IPA, refreshing beer. Bitter bite at end was expected and enjoyed. Mouthfeel: well-carbonated and complimented the roaring hop-iness. Drinkability: pretty good for a bitter CA IPA, IMHO. Excellent beer overall. ETOH content was undetectable."
"Another solid offering from Lagunitas."
"drinkability is very high, really tasty, alcohol hidden well,"
"D - An enjoyable DIPA, to be sure. I love the tropical fruit aromas and flavors going on here. The brighter fruity and floral qualities are well-balanced by the herbal piney flavors from the hops. A great DIPA for quaffing on warm summer evenings!"
"Drinkability is good."
"Etc: """O.G. 1.085, Alc. 8% by vol., 102 I.B.U.""" Plus a weird/creepy farmhouse on the label and the same spelling of stupid as the band Slightly Stoopid."
"D Not good. I will finish the bomber (in the interest of scientific process and investigation) but I would have preferred to share this bomber with another Beer Advocate. That being said, I think that the drinkability is about average for the style."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent hop bomb that is worth drinking for a long time."
"A transparent orange with small white head. Tons of lacing. Extreme citrus smell. Taste is good but very light for an 8% beer which makes the beer's drinkability off the chart. The mouthfeel gets dinked a little because this one was well over-carbonated. In general I like a more malty balance to such a hoppy beer."
"Very complex with hops dominating and the floral flavor throughout, yet enough malt and bread in it to make it balanced enough to drink. A very good IPA which I very much enjoyed and recommend."
"Pours a clear golden copper color with about a finger of bone white head. There is a prominent, mostly pine, hop aroma. It certainly hoppy but not overwhelming. Taste is pretty darn good. A bit of malty sweetness upfront but that is quickly overwhelmed by hops. Hop flavor is overwhelmingly pine but there a citrus and some floral notes near the finish. Bitterness is high but supported by a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel is good with a medium-ish body, moderate carbonation and a relatively oily (from the hops) sensation. Drinkability is pretty good. Very enjoyable and easily quaffable."
"Don't get me wrong, I Love Lagunitas, and they make some of my favorite beers and do some fun goofy oddball stuff that I really dig (like Lumpy Gravy), but this, in my opinion, is way over-hyped."
"Not equal to some of the hype, but a solid DIPA, and at $4.49/bomber, worth visiting multiple times."
"My label does not say Sonoma Farmhouse on it, I don't know if that makes it a different release. This one says, """120 I.B.U.4.U.""" and in little text underneath, """say lah-goo-KNEE-tis"""."
"D: At 8% ABV and 102 IBU's I can only drink one of these. But this is still a great DIPA that is packed with delicious hops. Another great offering from Lagunitas."
"Prost!"
"Pours a turbid amber with a thin milky head. Smells of sweet citrus-y hops. Super malty and sweet flavor comes first, then citrus, then bitter hops. ...when i burped, i got a mouthfull of the hop aroma. Not a conventional way to review, but it happened. Drinkability is good, the low abv (for a DIPA) helps. Not as thick and sticky to the tongue as other DIPAs"
"I miss Oakland :("
"Mouthfeel is good. Dry finish, medium body."
"This is a pretty drinkable IIPA. I'm not sure that I love it, but I certainly found it to be pretty good and very interesting."
"This is one of the many double ipas and other strong beers offered by this brewery but not one of the best in my opinion. The appearance is not so great, the flavor is a little lacking and the hops is a little bit too strong. I like that they are coming up with many new brands and the name is cute and funny. I would recommend trying it but there are betters for the price."
" Hop Stoopid has a great mouthfeel and could see this being dangerous, as 8% it drinks like a session beer."
"A good beer, but it doesn't really stand out in the Lagunitas lineup, which is full of overhopped pale ales."
" I think this is a very well made beer, I can't really think of anything I don't like about the beer, other than the hop profile being very typical. Although it is nice, the grapefruity and piney profile does get old. It would have been nice to see an Imperial IPA with large amounts of newer hops, like Amarillo or Newport to add some interesting twists to the American IPA style, but this beer is still enjoyable for the hop heads."
"Overall: I've been drinking a lot of hop bombs recently in an attempt to cultivate a palate and respect for the style. This has begun the turn for me. After my first bomber, I called my LBS to get them to order it."
"Pours an impeccable light straw copper with a nice head that dissipates into a thing film and brings nice lacing down the glass with each sip. Smells a great balance of malt/hops. There is sweetness, caramel, chocolate, pine, citrus, grapefruit, plum, cat tails, hay, farms, cats and dogs. Taste is very balanced but bitter. Drinkability and mf are great."
"Pours a nice golden tone with a tame foamy head that quickly dissipates into a thin lace. Good aroma but nothing spectacular. The taste is powerful -- citrusy hop blast. The sweetness is there too almost honey like but the bitterness dominates. Some alcohol bite too. Great price, $3.89 for a bomber. As good as Pliny but not better :-) Highly recommended DIPA!"
"Light head which faded. Smells like citrus. My nose isn't clear so I don't pick up much else. Tastes like lemons soaked in pinesap, but in a good way. This is really drinkable for the alcohol. I'm not sure I like hops this much but it's pretty good for as strong as it is. I'm all about balanced beers an this fits this."
"Pliny is the gold standard of DIPAs for me, the perfect balance of all DIPAs - so among my social circles, I rate beers in terms of it. If Pliny is 100, I rate Hop Stoopid as a 97. Phenomenal brew."
"D: Surprised that this is a 100+ IBU beer, it doesn't taste like it. Very well balanced and drinkable given the ABV. Great value too."
"Poured from a bomber into my Saranac pint glass. The smell of this beer alone is outstanding. Strong aroma and taste of grapefuit, plus hops obviously. Surprisingly smooth for a beer with an ABV 0f 8%, almost dangerous. A near perfect hoppy beer. One of my favorite beers of all-time, no question."
"Lagunitas Hop Stoopid pours a good couple fingers of foam over a clear ruddy gold brew. Carbonation is steady, and the nose is West Coast American hops all the way- some grapefruit rind, some pine tree. The flavor is sweet fruity malts that gives over to sharp pine hop flavors of the back, with notes of butterscotch and marmelade. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, finishing dry. Alcohol by volume comes in at a tasty 8%, though I never really noticed it what with all the hoppy fireworks. For a hoppy-as-fuck brew, pretty balanced all things considered. If you like IPAs this is definitely one you need to check out."
"D: Very drinkable. The only problem is you don't taste the 8% ABV."
"Drinks fairly easy, ABV is well hidden, but this isn't the right blend of hops to get me too excited. Still, I'm always thrilled to try anything from lagunitas"
"very good offering, somethings off in the taste however."
"M = Medium to medium light, a little too light for a DIPA I feel, decent mouthcoating but nothing memorable, slight alcohol bite."
"This is a certainly a unique beer mixing two great styles together, the American Double and the IIPA. It has a bright reddish orange glow with a big head. Has a mostly sweet smell of malts and the presence of hops. The taste reflects both styles, the sweetness of the American Double with a honey-like flavor and the bitterness of the hops of the IIPA. The mouthfeel is thick and the beer is very sticky sweet...my mouth was sticking to the glass by the end of the beer. The name made me think it would be a hop bomb, but Hop Stoopid is a great tasting hybrid and the best of both worlds."
"D - pretty easy drinker. 8 percent is hidden well. not the best DIPA i've had, but decent"
"Mouthfeel: Pretty thin, which I've learned is to be expected from west coast IPAs."
"As for a DIPA, I think this falls a bit short. It's a good IPA, yet still not balanced. For a DIPA, I've had other brews that are hop bombs, but that doesn't mean this is bad. Drinkability is good, but wanes in the final 4oz as the hops just start to thin out."
"Overall: This is a pretty good beer. I have no complaints."
"it's a sweet brew, and bitterness is a prominent characteristic but certainly lets itself be known--not quite to the extent i might expect, however, from such a thoroughly hopped-elixir. the effect is of luscious citrus-y/piney hop nectar. cascade is joined by warrior and simcoe, i suspect (i am out of practice). some bright fruit pokes through. sweet, though not cloying, and certainly not chewy. this kind of hop payload requires a substantial delivery device"
"Had this a couple days ago after work. Poured a bronze orange color with thin white head that left good lacing. Smelled of hops, fresh herbs, fruit (berries, pineapple), and light malt. Tasted of berries, grapefruit, pineapple, and earthy hops. Smooth, just a little overcarbonated. Drank this one very quickly."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability is super high. Refreshing and doesn't hint at the big abv. There are so many really good double IPAs out there. And though this one is good, it just isn't one of my favorites."
"Drinkability- This light body IPA does not pack a bitter punch. It goes down smooth with a mild hint of grapefruit. I could drink this beer on a warm day for hours. In my opinion, this would be a great beer to binge drink for a rich beer snob."
"Overall- I think this is a very underrate IIPA. Not nearly as hyped as some of it's contemporaries, but it has outshined many of them. I would love to have these in my fridge at all times."
"Overall was impressed! Beer is a solid example of an over hopped ipa! Don't know i would label it a double ipa."
"I highly recommend this one."
"A clear golden orange color with a two finger thick foamy white head, some spotty lacing left, medium carbonation. Aroma of citrus hops, pine and orange peel , Flavor is very good ,crisp clean and hoppy , nice grapefruit ,and resin notes with a bit of orange peel, the malt does not seem to play a huge role but does provide a good balance and light caramel sweetness , a nice hoppy finish with a good amount of bitterness all around , full body , clean , slightly oily mouthfeel with a long finish. Very drinkable and quite tasty"
"Hazed light copper/gold with 1.5 finger head. Leaves some clingy lace once the head subsides. Smells of pine-tar and grapefruit. Taste of resin pine and citrus. Medium/high hops with a good malt balance. Bitter finish but never too much which keeps this brew drinkable."
"Poured into pint glass clear yellow with a two finger head. Good lacing, little retention. Smells of sweet hops. The taste isn't as much of a hop punch to the face as I'd like in a IIPA. It is however stronger than a regular IPA. There is a good amount of sugary flavors on the back end of the palatte. The mouthfeel is sticky. Lots of sugar left on my lips."
"Verdict: Hop Stoopid is a tasty beer, but perhaps a little plain compared to other Double IPAs. Maybe it's the way the beer is hopped, maybe it's the paler than normal malt base, or maybe it's the combination of both factors - but at the end of the day this comes off as an easier drinking and slightly less bitter take on the Double IPA."
"D- Very drinkable for an IIPA, I could drink it all night long. Smooth finish and delicious hop character that lingers on the tongue."
"Drinkability is a 4.5/5.0 as """not overwhelmingly hoppy", hopped up for sure, but has a nice balance with a suprisingly smooth malt finish sneaks in."
"Purchased from Otto's Wine Cask in Brown Deer, WI. Poured a bright golden body with a white head and good lacing. Aroma is of sweet citrus hops like orange and grapefruit. Medium bodied with an orange peel flavor. The malts hold up well with the bitterness but don't steal the show. Long, pleasantly bitter finish. Great drinkability for a double IPA, although it didn't seem like 102 IBU."
"Well...this is good beer. You won't pucker, and you won't get that """bitter beer face""". Might get this again, given it costs less than other DIPA's."
"D- very drinkable, could drink this all day...I have to resist from pounding the whole thing in one sip"
"Good drinkability for 8% ABV. No perceptible boozy presence at all. Once again, a great foundation for what could have been an even better beer."
"Short beginning to the malt, soon to default to the strong, strong hop bite. Interestingly, the aftertaste is very short. Good body with a slightly high carbonation. Way too easy to drink, considering the ABV."
"Overall, reminds me a lot of a 6-month-old Hopslam. That's not a bad thing."
"Good, sturdy, enjoyable brew - just not top-notch for a DIPA. Just a big IPA. Other DIPA's from Lagun. were much better."
"This is a bit hazy and it pours a nice amber color. Just enough patchy head to cover the top. This has a thick resinous hop aroma. Smells like a big whiff of cascade hops rubbed together in your hand. I get the strange scent of grape jelly which is pleasing. The only thing wrong with the scent is that I wish it was stronger. I get a cotton candy like sweetness as I drink. I also taste orange juice, carmel, and white chocolate. All rolled up into a nice bitter package. Delicious. This has a wonderful thick resinous mouthfeel that lingers pleasently after each sip. I will definetly drink this more often. Maybe the best Dipa I have had so far. So clean and a delicious hop flavor. Thank you lagunitas."
"A must-have for hopheads."
"Taste is straightforward and nice, hits with some syrupy sweet malts at the start and ends with a nice thick hop kick followed by a pleasant bittersweet aftertaste and thick mouthfeel"
"D - A solid DIPA that goes down pretty easy for 8%."
"D: By far and away the best Lagunitas product that I have had to date. A Hop lover's delight for sure! Highly recommended."
"Very good DIPA, this is the second one I've bought, I would definitely buy again and am happy that this no longer seasonal but a full time Lagunitas beer now."
"[1xBOA]"
"D) Great. Sometimes crisp and tasty IPAs are too easy to guzzle, but this was something to savor. Very pleasurable. I easily downed the 22 ounces, and could have had more if I had one. The 8% was not noticeable (until I finished it)."
"BTW...price was more then reasonable...think I paid $4.99 for a 22oz"
"Tasty! A nice hoppy ale. Based on the name (Hop Stoopid) I was expecting something outrageous and barely palatable, but that's not nearly the case. Surprised by the candy/ fruity aspects, was expecting a hop bomb of traditional pine, lemon, grass, etc. Very different, interesting."
"Shared 22oz. bottle that Davey brought back from Portland. Poured into tulip glass golden yellow/orange color with a very active body and an off white head that lasted for a bit and left great lace all over the sides of the glass. Smells peppery, floral, grapefruit. Taste very Pliny-esque, floral hops, grapefruit. Medium body that seems to thicken up as it warms. This is an Awesome IIPA"
"D- An enjoyable, perhaps mild, take on the style. It drinks rather nicely."
"D: The most drinkable DIPA that I've ever had. As I mentioned earlier I will be hording this brew and it has been somewhat hard to find here in North Texas."
"Pours a dark yellow, clear, with lots of carbonation. It has a small head but with plenty of legs. Piney hops are redolent in the aroma. The first sip produces a big hop punch with a noticeable carbonation bite.This improves as it warms and some of the carbonation plays out. Not too bitter middle and finish for the style."
"for the price, this is one of the best ipa bombers i know of readily available in the texas area. big hop flavor for a small price. grabbed me a few"
"Not a favorite."
"Pours a melon like,bright copper amber hue. Good head after a steady pour. Good lacing and a thick layer of foam throughout all 22 ounces. Resiny citrus hops add great citrus to sweet toasted Wonderbread malts that make for one great DIPA aroma. Resiny pine tar, wildflowers, and orange rinds and triple sec sweetness. Plus the balancing malts that add so much needed softness and caramel to this 102 IBU IPA. This is one finely balanced DIPA. Great bitterness that isn't overwhelming and lest the malt be a big player in the overall flavor and palate of this beer. You don't really notice the 8% abv of this brew."
"D: I need to buy more of this. Not as aromatic as some DIPAs, but holy crap, a world beater."
"Decent price for a bomber over here in NJ at $4.5."
"On a side note: compared with several other excellent West Coast DIPAs (for instance HotD Blue Dot, AleSmith, and RR Pliny the Elder), this bottle is an absolute bargain, selling typically for $3.50-4 locally."
"Drinkability? My perceived clashing of the hops and malt make this just an average brew when it comes to how drinkable it is. The flavours just don't do it for me and I doubt I'd pick up any more."
"Overall, its not bad, but there are much better IPAs out there."
"I poured this out into a pint glass, and could smell it from a foot away. It looks great, deep reddish-orange and crisp and clear with a nice foamy white head. The smell is fantastic - lots of flowery complex scents. No smell of alcohol that I can detect, which is great. The taste...starts out with all those floral hops notes, but then leaves off very bitter and tasting almost like soap. After that great smell, I found the taste quite disappointing. I'll have to try this on tap somewhere and see if I get the same effect or if it's something to do with the bottled version. In any case, I'd try it again out of curiosity, but overall was a disappointed by the taste."
"An amazing brew. At first I was a bit hesitant with the claim """102 I.B.U. 4 U.""" on the bottle's label. 102 IBUs? I was scared that I'd be drinking something that tasted like a blend of Pine-Sol and Dogfish Head 90 Minute, but Lagunitas hit a home run with this one. The hops are perfectly distributed between aroma, flavor and bittering. Classic California IPA hops dance throughout the bouquet--resinous and with tight citrus notes--with deeper, mustier hints rounding it out. I think I detect the interesting, wild vegetal hops Warrior in there, blanketed behind the Cascades. The taste starts off slightly sweeter than I expected, but finishes with the same hop flavors as the aromas advertise. Final bittering note is long and delightful, complex and evolving. Starts out pineappley for just a moment and then heads into spicy dustbowl territory with bitter grapefruit pith. And for only $4.99 for a 22 oz bottle, I see myself stocking up on this one."
"nice orange amber color, pour nice with tasty head, smell of hops and citrus, taste very hoppy hint of grapefruitvery easy to drink goes down nice and has a kick but not too overpowering,awsome mouth feel and over all a really great beer...best beer i have ever have yet!!!"
"The taste is profoundly hoppy crispy, oily, juicy resinous hop pine notes. There isn't the orange burst or the florals with the hops in this case and there is a bit of imbalance in that the bready and biscuity malty base does not entirely complement the enormous hop presence. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. The hops and the hop juices really warm the cockles after things settle in a bit. At first blush, the beer was just over the top hoppy, but it became more warming and endearing as it settled. The aftertaste is quite strong and bittering, the mouthfeel isn't particularly oily from the resin of the hop. This is well worth seeking out if you want a serious hop experience. L'chaim."
"Hop Stoopid isn't the """biggest""" DIPA you'll find, but its probably the """biggest""" IPA you'd ever session. Very likeable, deserving many gold-stars."
"Overall: Very fine DIPA and reasonable priced one at that. $6 for a bomber? Nice!"
"Pours a nice clear light orange with rather soapy offwhite two finger head, settles to a thin layer. Smell: clementine, grapefruit, tropical fruit juice: pineapple in syrup, passion fruit, pine earthiness, mild sweet toasty malt, hint of a menthol-like mint component. Taste: sweet citrus, grapefruit, piney and leafy. For all of the IBUs, the bitterness is not overpowering and the sweet biscuity malt comes through nicely. Lighter side of medium bodied with a lingering oily bitterness. A nice citrusy dipa, not the expected bitter bomb."
"Overall, I have not been the biggest fan of Lagunitas, but I think this beer is great. Hop extract or not, I really like it. Clean tasting and the hops really do shine, did not get the grassy notes you can get from too much dry hopping. I really enjoyed this beer."
"If hops do truly help provide tranquil sleep, I will be sleeping well tonight."
"This beer is really easy to drink, nicely carbonated, the alcohol isn't noticeable at all. I do wish it were more bitter and hoppy. With a name like Hop Stoopid I expected a real hop-bomb, although a good beer it was a bit of a let down."
"Great offering by Lagunitas."
"Some double IPAs I find to be too strong in certain areas. This one is almost too weak - taste is a bit too sweet, not enough hops present, etc. That said, it is still a decent beer... but I'd rather just have a regular ol' Lagunitas IPA instead."
"Actually much thinner than I could have possibly expected with an ABV of 8%. Good carbonation but the body is lacking. It's a fun bottle and a definite hop fix, but you can't possibly expect to drink anything else afterward."
"No pine"
"Overall - Tremendous beer, especially when considered from a value perspective. Bombers are 3.99 to 4.99, definitely a great deal."
"A really good DIPA, not too syrupy sweet with a great raw hop flavor and aroma. All hops and not much malt sweetness, just the way i like it."
"Hop Stoopid pours a picturesque dark gold / orange with a smallish eggshell head; it's crystal clear and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. The aroma is dominated by piney hops, with some apricot and/or tropical fruit, as well - throw in some grapefruit peel to round out the big hop profile. When this stuff hits your mouth, its a big-time hop blast - lots of grapefruit bitterness - a little bit of the tropical citrus sweetness is there but not as key a component as in the aroma; there's also a noticeable amount of resinous flavor. Mouthfeel is somewhere between medium and full bodied. Probably seems a little lighter because of the high carbonation (zing!). Its definitely a mouth-coating ale, and is also a touch oily. Its fairly drinkable for a double IPA. There's a lasting bitterness, but its not overpowering. One of the more drinkable DIPA's I've had."
"My only regret is only picking up one 22ounce bomber. Guess I will be buying a few more tommorow. You should definately seek this one out. This is right up there with all of the other bad boy brew's... A true gem not to be overlooked... I would gladly pay $10.99 a sixer if they would ever package it that way..."
"This is an excellent beer! Very easy to drink. I'm glad I bought two and happy to know it's available at my local grocery store."
"Great beer and at $3.99 at the local market how can I go wrong!? Good job Lagunitas!"
"Drinkability: This beer is made for the hop-head. Great hop taste that isn't overwhelming, with a smooth clean finish. I am regretting only buying one bottle. If you like hops, you will like this. Outstanding."
"Still, I put it right up there with more expensive DIPAs."
"Taste is super bitter with floral and fruity hop flavors. Modest malty balance fails to hold a candle to this uber-hopcentric ale. Not sure what else to say, this bitch is hoppy as a mutha flopper."
"D-Awesome beer. I am almost done with this bomber and this review took me maybe 10 minutes. I find IPA's very drinkable and this is no exception. The complexity, balance, and flavor profiles all create a desire for another swallow. I will buy this many, many more times if available. This cost me $3.69 for the 22oz at Central Market Ft. Worth. Get them while you can-this is the definition of value."
"This beer pours light orange in color with a nice frothy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of citrus and pine. The taste is bitter hops with citrus flavors and a dry finish. The mouthfeel has a medium to full body and coats the tongue. This beer is creamy upfront and finishes dry. Drinkability is decent. I took my time enjoying this bomber. One of the best things about this beer is the price. A good pick for anyone who needs a hop fix for the night and doesn't want to spring for a pricy DIPA six pack."
"Where's the 6 pack? I could drink a few 12 oz'ers easily."
"mouthfeel is a little thin but the beer is very easy drinking. i expected a little more, but for the prie it performs very well. the alcohol is not noticable at all."
"Hop Stoopid is stoopidly drinkable. The hop quality is well rounded and smooth. The alcohol is well hidden. One of the easiest drinking double ipa's I have encountered."
"Wow This beer is so good. The aroma is the strongest part of this beer. The citrusy/piney hops aroma is so amazing. I have no clue what hops are used in this beer and would love to know. The mouthfeel is a nice medium bodied easy drinking ipa. Well balanced beer the hops are at the fore front but do no kill your palate. Were it not for the high abv I would reccomend this beer as a session beer. One of my top 5 beers not just ipa's. Love it!"
"Overall, a pretty damn good DIPA, but not my favorite. Can't beat if for the price though."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, I love it so much! It was pure heaven. I will be drinking a lot more of this."
"Great full rich mouthfeel makes this tasty beer extremely enjoyable. Highly drinkable. I wish I had another!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- For an 8% ABV, this one is pretty easy going. I could see myself drinking at least 2 bombers in a session."
"D- very drinkable, very sessionable."
"In the end the beer is gone too fast and I am left wanting more, not from the beer, just more OF the beer."
"Thick and creamy. Bristly and fizzy. This beer is heavy and thick. Major wood hops. I poured a second almost immediately (which I rarely do of the same beer) so it must be drinkable. A helluva nice beer."
"Because of the lower abv it's more easier to drink this, more of a nice drinker for hot days, not a sipper but an easy bomber to go down. Not my favorite but nicely done."
"D - Fantastic DIPA that is definitely my favorite offering from Lagunitas by far. Hop Stoopid boasts a huge West Coast hop character that measures up to its peers quite well."
"golden orange, very slight chill haze, creamy white head dissipates to a nice collar of lace. aroma is honeyed floral citrus, with some tropical fruit and grassy pine underneath. taste is juicy, fruity hops with just the right amount of sweet biscuity malts underneath. medium-bodied and nicely carbonated. long drying finish of smooth hop bitterness. this was surprisingly good, even more surprising is how much i liked the use of hop extract in this versus pellets or even fresh hops."
"Great beer - all in all this is a super hoppy IPA that screams west coast styling. I liked it very much, especially at $4.99 a bomber. Certainly worth checking out next time you see it on the shelves."
"The carbonation, texture, and character of this beer make it a for sure winner. If you don't like hops, stay the hell away from it, though. I could drink these all night."
"Just picked this badboy up at the local Jug Shop here in San Francisco,Ca. A great lace began to appear right after the pour. As i began to take a taste the beautiful scent of great hops and a slight, malty nose. The color was a beautiful cooper, filled with a great sophisticated and pointed hop taste. I would recommend a taste for anyone."
"Extremely easy-drinking, the 8% ABV is well-hidden and quite sneaky. Wonderfully well-balanced, this brew is quite deceiving yet superbly interesting, pleasant and complex."
"Overall a very good DIPA. Not overly sweet like some of the other ones out there."
"Drinkability - An easy beer to love, and yes you should as well. A well crafted DIPA on the lighter side of things, but that makes it beautiful in it's own way. It's no less flavorful than any DIPA i've tasted, just a little lighter with the hops and the mouthfeel. I'll make sure to enjoy this one time and time again."
"This one pours a nice clear copper with a thin white bubbley head and slight lacing on the edges. The nose is a beautiful blend of citrus hops and a touch of pine. Just fantastic all around. The taste is just like the nose with a slight malt backbone. The hop flavors just give it that delicious sweet then bitter finish. This is my favorite style of hop blend. The mouthfeel is lively and nice carbonation. The drinkability on this is outstanding and the price is unreal $4.99! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME??!!"
"cheers"
"22 oz. bomber. Poured out a clear yellow with a hint of burnished orange. The head was cloud white without very much retention or lacing. The nose was very tantalizing. When I read people referring to a piney flavor I always know what they mean, but it is like a description utilizing an approximation; a best guess. This, however, was the real deal. It smelled like a walk through the woods around my house up in Maine. A mixture of fresh spruce and white pine needles carpeting the floor. Another memory that flashed to mind was decorating a Christmas tree. All that amazing smell trapped in a small, candlelit living room with snow piling up and frost crystallizing against the window pane. It is an alluring smell and if women wore perfume like this I would have trouble concentrating on anything. Ever. The taste had more of that tasty pine zest along with a fruity backbone. It ended with an excellent dry finish."
"very nicely made DIPA, very fresh hop feel and taste, a winner."
"I poured this from a bomber and found a pale golden color. The aroma was fragrant with hops and had a strong grapefruit component. The ale had a medium mouthfeel. The taste was hoppy from the start with a nice citrus flavor in the beginning that turned more flowery by the finish. The aftertaste was a combination of wonderfull floral hops and alcohol warmth."
"overall: A serviceable IPA that, while being perfectly enjoyable, fails to really distinguish itself from the DIPA crowd. I'd definitely buy it again, but that's only because Pliny the Elder and Hopslam aren't available here."
" Yeah, the drinkability is a bit low for me. I am a hophead, but for some reason this beer is a bit of a challenge. Real oily and bitter. Damn, i still have two-thirds of a bomber left."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. Loved it and great price."
"Overall, well I am on a somewhat empty stumach as compared to normal when I drink beer, but I am already feeling a buzz after going through about 12 oz of this beer. Yes that is kind of sad, but I was in the sun all day and am kind of dehydrated. Once it get through the rest of this bomber I may be well off for the night. It is good, but potent. I want to drink more and I will!"
"OK so this brew is hopefully not one of them I'm going to stuff as many IBUs in this as a can and who cares how the flavor turns out, brews. Pours golden with a large white head. Aroma is hops as expected, mostly piny sticky hops which is the best kind imo. Some grapefruit and peach wich is nice. This brew is hoppy, a little more bitter than a PtE which I just had, but a solid malt flavor to keep it from being overbearing. This hop bomb deserves to be in the elite with the x2IPAs as they've managed to balance bitterness with flavor and some sweetness in there as well. Not quite as good as PtE but close. Good Job Lagunitas, this is easily the best I've had from this brewery."
"I want some good cheddar, but I'll live without it. I foresee no trouble finishing this bomber."
"i'd love to drink one of these bombers on the regular, but that'd be it, not gonna drink this all day or i'd be done pretty quick"
"This one really deserves some credit for its drinkability. Thankfully the distribution is solid enough here in the Carolinas for this to be my craft beer summer go-to. It's a light and refreshing DIPA! Are you kidding me? Eight percent ABV makes this the most sessionable hop bomb I've ever encountered. At $4.95 after its 3,000 mile road trip to my specialty shop, I'm tempted to do $30 sixers every time (it's really more like $30/12 since they're 22oz bombers)! Labeling Hop Stoopid exceptionally drinkable is a real no-brainer. HA!"
"Overall, I think this beer is great. Not the best IPA I have had, but easily in my top 10 IPAs. Lagunitas hit a grand slam with this one. I actually enjoy this beer alot more than 'the big guns' like Hopslam and Dreadnaught. This is more 'in your face' and not as balanced as the two I just mentioned. Excellent beer and highly recommeded."
"Overall - this is one of my very favorite beers. People compare this to PTE and Ruination, and I feel like it's squarely in the middle. Considering the availability, cost, and taste, this should be near the top of anyone's list for a go-to beer. It's the kind of beer that keeps my faith, and keeps me coming back to craft beers again and again. I love it."
"There is nothing that really stands out about this beer, other than how drinkable it is. It is really crisp and obviously very hoppy. The most amazing thing is the value of this beer. For $5 a bomber you really get your money's worth. I have been pretty impressed with all o the Lagunitas I have sampled and ths is no exception. Great taste and great value."
"J"
"It's a very drinkable DIPA. It's tasty, thin, and doesn't dominate your senses. And at 5 bucks for a bomber, this is worth going back to often. A very good DIPA at a great price. People stack this up there with HopSlam, Pliny, Ruination, etc and it's not even close. But it's solid, nonetheless."
"Pours a dark amber colour with a generous head. The nose is great with grapefruit, a little pine resin and just a hint of brown sugar. After a big initial grapefruit hit with an early piney element which quickly wanes there is a more subtle almost minty herbal bitterness which comes through. Not particularly sophisticated or complex but well above passable. More please!"
"This just hit me as being OK. I've had a dozen IPAs better than this, but a $4.50 price tag makes it more appealing."
"Beer poured golden orange with a thick white head that is leaving nice rings behind as i sip this. Nose is quite nice, citrusy hops are huge and fresh. Taste is good, decent amount of malts blend fairly well with a huge amount of piney-citrusy hops that are leaving an oil slick behind. Mouthfeel is full and very smooth - quite satisfying. Drinkability is good. This is a very nice beer with a nice price. Recommended to hop heads!"
"Pours a lively golden with a vast fluffy head and great lacing. The aroma is absolutely gigantic, piles and piles of floral and citrusy hops, though not as powerfully grapefruity as has become fashionable lately. The hops have a bit more pine, a little lemon. But still vast. The flavor follows along precisely, all hops all the time, rolling waves of flower, pine, and citrus. The alcohol is muted and the grain is largely lost behind the wall of hops. The one weak poitn is the mouthfeel - it is excessively sticky and resiny, leaving a sticky sweetness around the lips, which is great for a soda but a little weird in a beer."
"D - I would not have a problem drinking a lot of these."
"Bottle into pint glass. Pours deep gold with only a slight veil. Resiliant head that gives off a strong pine smell with a little grapefruit underneath. The beer displays truth in advertising: The flavor initially is a pure pine bomb with only a slight malt sweetness to provide balance. After the hops put on their prolonged one-note show of rich bitterness, the complexity emerges. The finish takes on your taste buds from all sides, giving your throat a dry smack with a bit of citrus sweetness on the tongue. If you don't enjoy a big hop show, give this one a pass. I usually prefer a little more malt balance in a DIPA, but I like this one. If you enjoy a beer that mixes brute force with just a bit of grace, Hop Stoopid is well worth your time. Pair with sweet & sour pork or a sweeter Thai dish such as pad see ew."
"D- You'd only want one of these, but you'll enjoy it the whole way down. I'm Hop Stoopid; Lagunitas is Hop Brilliant. Amazing stuff. If you like hops, you HAVE to try this beer."
"Had yet another long day at work today and thought I would crack this open. Poured 22 ounces into a British pint glass. Pours a copper, amber color, with a decent head and some lacing. Smell is slighly alcoholic and citrusy. Taste is hoppy, citrusy, slightly bready with a subtle, but surely appreciated malty backbone. Moderate carbonation in the mouthfeel. Overall, a great IPA."
"Thin foam spreads across the surface, interspersed throughout are large bubbles, otherwise a tightly knit layer of eggshell white, wide streaks of lacing. Very light haze to the metallic zinc orange hue, glows warmly, the rims retain more orange than yellow. The nose is undoubtedly hoppy but in no way lacks for honey molasses, caramel tones, this in turn sweetens the orange, pink grapefruit citrus as well as the floral dew, the peach, apricot, apple fruit cruises below the radar, really nothing exaggerated nor """stoopid""" about this array of scents. Full-bodied, fluffy carbonation lacks precision but fills up the mouth with breadth. Honeyed bread, caramel, molasses meet up with a certain mineral water freshness to staunch excess sweetness. The hoppiness here is strong but nothing unusual, just loads up on the grains, grasses and thick yeasts. Some ginger and pine but, overall, doesn't look to bite real hard. Carbonation continues to swirl through the finish."
"Lagunitas (Lah-goo-KNEE-tuss -- I've been saying it wrong ever since I first heard the name): Please please start distributing to New Hampshire!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - easy session Double IPA - I recommend this for the IPA drinker that likes the citrusy - lighter fruit - apricot IPA's - not tons of dark malts in this one - although there is a hinting innuendo of dark chocolate malt on this finish. This is a great."
"D: Another great beer. Hops are center stage, but they're not over done, resulting in a beer that's easy to drink and enjoy."
"D and overall impression: The sweetness of this brew limits the drinkability. That being said, I think this is a fine beer. Good ABV at 7.7%, better than Maximus, but not on the level of some of the world class DIPA's. Skal."
"Not as full bodied as I expected, actually a bit thin, and this lends to drinkability. They did something right with this one, because the bomber disappeared very quick. Not the best IPA that I've had (wasn't even the besst of the evening), but worth grabbing by far. Good beer for hop-heads."
"D - Excellent. Lagunitas has done a good job of cramming in a ton of hop flavor and aroma without completely killing your taste buds. Very refreshing for 8% ABV."
"Poured into Duvel Tulip. Three finger head looks fantastic. Smells of pine, citrus and slight floral notes. Very nice smell but still short of my two favorites, Pliny and Two Hearted. Taste is very good and follows right along with the smell. Mouthfeel is above average and very drinkable for such a high IBU beer. I would put this in my top 10 IPA's at the moment. Highly recommended."
"Notes: The nose seems to be so much of the flavor of this beer, the more I moved it around in my mouth, the more I liked it. But it still didn't live up to the initial sniff."
"D: It goes down smooth and leaves a bitter pucker. Its a mouth trick that I can do over and over again. I dig it!"
"D- A very drinkable DIPA. Amazingly balanced in my opinion for something called """hop stoopid""""
"This is a great beer, easily the best beer I've had from Lagunitas and a really great double IPA. Most of their IPA/DIPAs have not really measured up for me, but this one is world class. I'll be looking for this one from now on."
"The """Beer Review Tips""" tips include the hint """All '5''s should be rare""". Agreed, but this is THAT good. I don't know what I'd do to improve this except make it a year round beer and put it into six packs. The taste is very clean/crisp. Very well balanced. Right off the bat this beer jumped to among my very favorite."
"The beer had a medium body feel to it with good carbonation and it was pretty smooth. Drinkability suffers from the bitterness a bit. Overall a really good beer."
"D- The sweetness is a little much at times and hurts the drinkability a tad, but regardless this is a fine DIPA that is highly recommended!"
"Very creamy feel. Sometimes it seems to verge on a slightly unpleasant syrupiness, but it never gets there, thankfully. ABV is very well hidden, evidenced only by a bit of numbing that builds as you get through the 22 ounces. A bit heavy to have anything more than is in the bomber."
"D: For the price and taste this is a damn fine DIPA. Check that for the price it is probably one of the best DIPAs out there. Glad this is going to be a year round release. Lagunitas might not make the best beers but damn do they not make some of the best affordable beers."
"What an amazing elixir. I like it about as much as Pliny the Elder and I'm not ashamed to say that. I wish I could put this side by side with Dreadnaught though because I feel like that comparison is perhaps a little more similar. It's just been too long since I've had Dreadnaught (little over a year) Really great drinkability though, goes down easy, raw bitterness leaves you wanting more, and the alcohol isn't really apparent in any way shape or form."
"D: This beer is fairly drinkable. It has a relatively lower abv when compared to some other beers in this style. I could put down two of these bombers in one sitting, but I wouldn't want to waste the few remaining ones that I have."
"D: a very tasty DIPA. i could drink a couple of these."
"d - good sipper. you can taste the hops on your tongue long after you swallow."
"hop extract be damned - i want more of this!"
"D - A good DIPA, as most DIPAs are. There's not anything remarkable or unique about this brew aside from the amazing price. Very drinkable and a good, affordable DIPA to keep on hand. Definitely a repear purchase."
"D- I really like this DIPA and would have to say if I could get it around here I would. Nothing too over the top but it is a damn tasty beverage never the less. Would be a staple in my fridge if I could make it a reality."
"Notes: This is such a wonderful example of what a double i.p.a should be. Cheers"
"Pours a golden orange with thick, foamy white heady. Very floral hop character in the aroma and flavor. A slight bit of sweetness in there as well. Very refreshing and crisp, much more floral then fruity. Well-balanced mouth.. full, basically exactly what you'd expect. Oerall its certainly delicious and very good, but its not really that different than any other very hoppy beer. Not too much of an individual."
"Great beer from Lagunitas. Totally changes my view of hop extracts."
"Overall: Pretty good drinkability, great basic DIPA, considering the price and availability this is a great DIPA to keep on hand. Nothing is overwhelming in the flavor."
"Overall impression: A big, citrusy, American IPA. There isn't enough malt or alcohol punch to be a Double IPA. But it is very good and all about the hops. Nicely done."
"I bought a 22 ounce bottle for $3.99 at the local upscale market. My bottle says 8.0% alcohol as opposed to the 7.70% listed. Nice orange and copper hued appearance with a dense cream head. Awesome hoppy pine grapefruit and orange aroma. Very clean and sweet. As perfect as I've smelled. The great hoppyness is abundant in the taste but the bitterness is very mild and pleasant. Mild citrus notes. Very much reflects the great aroma. Pretty easy drinking. Not too heavy or syrupy at all considering the style and ABV. Awesome IPA. Hard to beat. Among the best I've ever had."
"Pours an amber/golden color with a off white head. The head thins out as you drink it but it leaves a lot of lacing. Smells of fresh American hops, piney and slightly citrusey. Tastes a hell of a lot like grapefruit from the hops. This is common in a lot of DIPAs I've had, but I've never had one that had it this obvious. There's a lot of hop bitterness, but it doesn't overwhelm the beer. I've had pale ales that """taste""" more bitter, despite the 102 IBU scrawled across the top of the label. This is a fairly hyped beer and I was afraid it wasn't gonna live up to it but it does. I have a feeling the scores on this one will be very high, but I think I like Stone's interpretation of the beer better. I don't feel like I should score it lower since its so well balanced though."
"Drinkability: Wow. What can I say. Virtually flawless. With more head retention and a bit more variability in the nose, this would be a 5 all the way across. Don't pass this one up."
"Crystal clear amber syrup divides liquid malt extract with spicy, herbal hop flavor and aroma. Aroma is excellent; spicy and piny. The view is clean as a maple syrup pilsner with spider web lacing around the pint. Grainy, boozey syrup dominate the character with citrus peel, pineapple, and tropical fruit burn riding long. Amateur hour. What ever happened to clean 2 row and a heavy, well thought out hop distribution?"
"Clear amber with orange hues. Soft pillowy white head. Pine, evergreen, alcohol in the nose. Sweet, citrus syrup, orange peel, alcoholic booze finish with hop soap coating the tongue. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. A warming double IPA that is not an aggressive drink and there is something enjoyable about the oily slickness of the potion especially in the summertime. Its not the greatest of Double IPA's but worth trying."
"Drinkability: Looks and smells great, but some strange off flavors. My wife likened them to old hops wrapped in wet newspaper. Would have been a drain pour for me, but I just gave my pint glass to her. Probably my first and only try sampling of this one."
"D: Very drinkable for a hop head."
"A winner."
"D: 4.5 good hot night sipping beer, try not to spill"
"This has moved well up on my list of both Lagunitas offerings and DIPAs. Excellent beer, yet another gem from Lagunitas."
"Pours very clear with a nice head that leaves some lacing. I think there is a bit of hops in this one, not sure from the aroma....right. I wasn't surprised how bitter this one is to start with but it finishes nice and clean, crisp. Taste is what you expect of, strong hop bite with some citrus tones but there is something else there. Might be a bit of straw flavor with maybe some sour apple. This is very drinkable and quite enjoyable. It is a bit different which I like. Not exactly like any other DIPA out there."
"Pours a crystal clear, light amber with a nice finger of white head. The aroma is straight citrus hops. Its just booming with hops and they are sticky, gooey fresh. Extremely sweet malts with a lingering citrus hop bitterness that surprisingly doesn't stay around for too long. Its a light-medium bodied beer and its stickiness coats your mouth. Very nice beer, The aroma would make you believe that it would be more bitter than it ends up being. More of an IPA than a double IPA."
"D-Givin the abv, I could try to drink a second bomber, but that would leave me stumbling. So I don't think I will have more than one. Wisdom you know.... Well, it does go down very smoothly though. Please go out there and find you some. It's a hoplovers delight."
"The drinkability is high but not too high because of the harshness of the hops and higher alcohol content. I would not reach for a second bomber unless it was party time."
"This is a great DIPA. I recommend it."
"Pours a clear amber colored body, with an average sized off-white head, diminishing. Bitter, dry, extremely hoppy, sweet citrusy aroma. Sickly sweetness. Enticing. Hoppy taste, sweet. Some citrus. Not too bitter or caustic. Almost like a pale ale."
"Really doesn't have the punch that I expected from the 102 IBU listed on the label, but that's not necessarily a bad thing I guess. Overall, a nice tasting, enjoyable brew that I will probably have to try again"
"D--This bomber couldn't stand my wrath for long. One of the more drinkable DIPA's I've had. Overall this is a fantastic beer and I recommend hunting it down."
"D: A top-shelf DIPA. If extracts can be this good, maybe other brewers should make use of them."
"As for drinkability, as much as I tried to sip this I practically chugged it. It just went down a little too easily. But while I don't taste much alcohol, after a bomber of 8% beer I do feel it a little. So maybe I'd want to keep it two two bombers at any one time."
"Well, I certainly don't get the hype but if you're looking for a solid DIPA, I can recommend this. I could also recommend at least 5 other DIPAs but you can't wrong with giving this a try. The claim of 102 IBUs means nothing to me because my taste buds can't tell the difference, though they are starting to improve when it comes to hops."
"This beer poured a light copper color with a big foamy off-white head. The smell is a bit of malt with a nice burst of floral, fruity, and citrusy hops. The taste is starts off with some fruitiness that gives way to some piney hops and then some citrus rind the in finish. The whole time the malt does a pretty good job of balancing everything out. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer for being so hoppy, and I'm glad I snagged a bottle while it was still available."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and rich. The body of the beer is medium and finish pleasantly linger on the palate for a few moments. This is a good DIPA, a strong flavor with a descent back bone. I enjoyed it very much."
"Then again, that keeps me from absolutely gulping this one down. If you like DIPAs that explore the citrus side of things (and I do), you've got a big winner here."
"D - One of the more drinkable DIPAs that I've had. Not overly bitter or boozy, but still lots of nice hop flavor. This is one I'll come back to again."
"Off-white or beige head, one finger with some lace, not a lot of retention. Orange colour, not quite clear. The nose was a sweet apricot with hops, quite nice. Firey hoppy mouthfeel and taste, bitterness dominates, pomegranite, dry finish, grapefruit moreso in the finish with a pine aftertaste that detracted a bit from an overall good impression. A bit acidic and a little gassy. Alcohol well handled. There was something missing, I wondered if the malt didn't weigh in enough to balance the hops, it was a bit sour as well. Still, overall, representative of the style and well worth a try."
"Copper clear, very small head. Wonderful citrus smell. The taste is all citrus with just a touch of bitterness. While hoppy, this beer isn't one dimensional. The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but not unpleasant. This mouthfeel probably contributes to high drinkability."
"Solid beer by Lagunitas keep up the good work"
"Good flavor on this IIPA; nothing really stands out and blows me away, just a solidly crafted hop-bomb here. Starts off with juicy grapefruit citrus and piny hops, quickly balanced by pale crystal malts and a bit of honey. Bitterness lingers long into the finish, but never becomes acerbic or over-bearing. Near perfect mouthfeel, with a bubbly medium body that's both crisp and refreshing. Great drinkability, too; I'm not only looking forward to the second half of this bomber, but I can't wait for the 2nd bomber I purchased today. Kudos to Lagunitas for consistently laying down the hop-smack."
"This poured a bright copper/orange color out of my bomber. Thin head stuck around lacing the glass throughout. Crisp citrus hops smell with a rush of pine. I knew this was gonna be good before I even took a drink. Taste is a domination of the citrusy/piney hops. There is a muted malt note in there as well. I was hoping for a touch more of the hop bomb taste because of the beautiful scent, but this beer is still very good. The 8% ABV was unnoticeable. It would be pretty easy to get stoopid drunk on this stuff. I'll be having more of these in the future!"
"The taste of the beer contains all of the same attributes as the nose.This is a sweet, almost candy-like DIPA. I detect some bubble gum, molasses and candied pineapple is prominent. Also fresh white grapefruit and some herbal/earthy notes surface. The slightly bitter finish plays off of the sweet flavors to create an amazing overall flavor. The creamy body adds to this beer's likeability. This is a superior DIPA because it is not just bitter, it really showcases the superpowers of the hops flower. I wasn't expecting to like this beer so much, but it's definitely one of the best new DIPAs I've tried lately."
"Overall, not as good as I had hoped. It was a solid IPA, but not too interesting and what was up with the salt?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, refreshing."
"The lighter body, crisp aftertaste and enticing aroma make this quite a DIPA to kick back with."
"overall a very good dipa but just not as good as hopslam or double trouble"
"mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good, lagunitas does not dissapoint"
"This is a very good beer that, for the price, stacks up against some of the better DIPAs."
"Hop Stoopid has more than lived up to expectations, it has kicked them in the ass and made me it's bitch. This beer has made me so happy to be a craft enthusiast and I hope it is around Houston for a while, I need to go stock up! Now if only we could get some Pliny, Bells and Founders...."
"The mouthfeel was sturdy with moderate carbonation. This reminds me of a bitter Bell's Two Hearted. A great double IPA in my book and priced well at 4.99 a bomber."
"It's official, I am a confirmed hop head!"
"D: Umm...it is hop stoopid so the name suggests this isnt' your daily IPA and I agree. A nice thing to try but once or twice...or thee times is probably enought."
"Light toasted malt up front, before a full on hop assault. To be fair, there is also some tropical, fruity sweet malt in the front end, but it mixes well with the pineapple and citrus flavors of the hops. Big resin and pineapple hop flavors feature mid-palate. Orange marmalade and grapefruit citrus flavors follow up. Bitterness throughout, but not too numbing. This is largely about huge hop flavor, not bitterness, and I am really liking it! Smooth, creamy feel on a medium-full body. Goes down too easily--especially at $3.99 a bomber..."
"Good mouthfeel with a very good carbonation. and absolutely drinkable...for 4.99 I would drink this every single day."
"This is a fantastic DIPA. It drinks really well and is pretty much what you'd expect of a california 2IPA. There are certainly other beers out there that are more extreme but this one I don't mind having a few pints of. If you're a hop head, then this is a must try."
"D= This was the first time I ever had this beer from a bottle and I think it was quite good. Very drinkable for a DIPA with over 8% abv."
"I can drink this all night long. It is one of the best DIPA's I have had."
"bomber from Grape & Gourmet, Virginia Beach, VA"
"D - This is certainly one of the better DIPAs I have had. The hop aroma is very nice with all of the right notes. The flavor is balanced to favor hop character over bitterness, which is as it should be. The downside is that the flavor is almost cloyingly sweet and the extreme fruitiness of the hops exacerbates this characteristic. The somewhat soapy bitterness also hurts drinkability. In the end, this is a very nice DIPA, but for my money, Hopslam is still king."
"D- easy to finish and an easy way to get my hop fix. the price will have me coming back to this a few more times in the upcoming weeks. i wish this was year round, its better than some beers more than twice the price. i liked it alot more from the bottle than i remember liking it on draft. check this one out."
"This does what it says on the tin, hoppy as hell. Almost offputting at the start but definitely a winner."
"I like this. It's not ultra-special, but it satisfies the hop jones and does it with freshness, authority and, oh yeah, big flavor. I prefer a maltier base in this style, and having just had the Longshot Double IPA, Hop Stoopid pales in its shadow. But still, this is perhaps the best Lagunitas brew I've had yet."
"D: This goes down way too easy, no hint of alcohol, just a big yummy hop bomb. I could see myself finishing one bomber and opening another just for me. I see why people compare this to Hopslam, this is a great take on the double IPA style. Highly recommended, I wish I could get this in KY."
"D: Crisp & clean tasting. This has the IBU's of a DIPA, but drinks like a standard pale ale. Awesome."
"This is a fantastic and surprisingly drinkable beer. Hoppy but never too bitter. Great citrus notes through and through help make it really refreshing."
"Final thought: though incredibly delicious and very drinkable, I wouldn't mind the sweetness being toned down just a touch. A great beer though; let there be no doubt of that."
"piney and flowery hops dominate the flavor here - finish is clean, leaving my palate wanting the next sip - i've had a few of these over the last couple of months some warm, and some chilled to varied degrees, i prefer it chilled @ around 45 degrees - at $4.99 a bomber this is an excellent value - a winner from lagunitas."
"Pours an extremely clear pale golden with a big, frothy white head that retains extremely well. GREAT lacing. Smells sweet malts, pine, melon, mango, just tons of aromas smacking me in the face. Taste follows up nicely with tons of hoppy goodness. Very resiny pine, grapefruit, citrus notes, cantaloupe, sweet candied malts, lots of stuff going on. Reminds me of Southern Tier Unearthly bot a little less cloying sweetness. Thick mouthfeel, extremely oily, hop oils coat the mouth. I cant stop taking sips...this 22oz isn't gonna last too long."
"Pours a clear copper color with plenty of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. A nice sudsy white head settles into a light cap with some sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Some light grapefruit aroma and some pine. Not as strong as I would have thought. A fresh piney hop flavor, with some grapefruit notes, that ends with a littly resiny bitterness. Enough of a malt sweetness to balance out any bitterness. The feel is moderate, ever so slight chewy body, a notch below fizzy carbonation. Almost a perfect malt balance to the hops. A real enjoyable DIPA, not too malty sweet and some nice hop flavors. Probably not the most smash you over the head hoppy DIPA but this one has great balance. I will easily be able to put this bomber down."
"Clear filtered copper with a billowy head of thick tan foam and rings of lace. Rich tangerine, pine and grapefruit hops in the nose with a barely there underlying malt. Immediate attack of heavy grapefruit pith on the tongue, with a slick, oily body. Carbonation is appropriately low and drinkability is... well... for hopheads only. Resinous pine comes through on a second swig, and a light acidity and sweetness dance on the tip of the tongue. Yum."
"Pours out of the bottle a dark copper brown with off-white head. I don't detect too much hop aroma in the pour, but what I do pick up is some pineyness. My initial taste throws me for a loop-sweeter than I expected for a double IPA-most certainly not hop heavy in the taste. Finishes sweet with a little hop bitterness. Slippery and oily going down, carbonation is light which gives the beer a medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is very good, because the hops are not overwhelming."
"D: A very nice offering, would love to have on tap to see if the carbonation levels are minimized... first Lagunitas brew that I felt lived up to expectations."
"This beer pour a beautiful clear golden color. A 2 finger white foamy/sudsy head sits atop it. Head retention is fantastic, fading eventually into a thick film and leaving thick sheets of lacing behind. Nose is rather complex - there is a wonderful blend of pine, citrus and floral hops that are all so prevalent that it took me a long time to realize it was in fact all three. Taste lends slightly more to the citrusy hops, with floral and pine hops mixing in to give a well balanced hop blend that just hits you! Hops aren't the only flavoring to this brew, there is a nice caramel malt blend that balances this beer out. The beer is medium bodied, lighter on the carbonation. Mouthfeel is quite sticky, somewhat filling but not too filling. If it weren't for the ABV, I would sit with this puppy all night - even still the drinkability is quite nice!"
"D- Nice brew that feels easier than it is (if that makes any sense). Would be a great DIPA to introduce to someone as it is fairly well balanced and doesn't have a crushing bitterness, just enough to let you know that the hops are the boss."
"Don't get me wrong. It is a good beer. But just not worth the hype."
"D - Very easy to drink for a bigger beer and one you won't soon forget."
"Overall impression: Reminds me a lot of Rogue's Brutal Bitter. Lots of bitter hops, with just enough malt to keep it in control, but not tamed. This is a nice offering for a hop head, and I could drink a lot of it."
"Light golden amber color, one finger head fades quickly. lots of bubbles. Smells like fruity hops, mostly pineapple. not much else gets through. some sweet malt taste, mostly fruity hops, very bitter. Pleasing mouthfeel, nice carbonation level. Not bad as a whole. i was expecting more. very hop forward, but mostly just bitter and aroma. i was hoping for more delicious hop flavor. oh well, it was still pretty good."
"Pours a clear lemon with a nic head and some lacing. Smell is citrus, grapefruit, yet not harsh. Taste is a nice balance of citrus and grapefruit with a nice malt backbone. Does't seem like 102 abu. Mouthfeel is a nice balance also between hop presence and malt undertones. Easy on the drinkability scale even with higher abv."
"D: This is one IPA that goes down very easy. A drinkable beer and you don't really feel the ABV %."
"the label says 102 IBU's but i find that hard to believe. this is too easy to drink."
"My first impression of this beer was how easy it goes down. For a DIPA that boasts """102 IBU 4U""" it sure goes down smooth. Drinkablity on this one is very high, with me being able to finish this 22oz and want more, which is more than I can say for some of the other high IBU DIPA's that I've had. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability: Even though it's a big IPA, it goes down quite easily. Could definitely have two of these in an evening. The 8% ABV is hidden well."
"update: had some recent 8.0% ABV bottles, and it wasn't as good, not sure what changed."
"Drinks well for a big IPA, but for me was a little bit of a letdown for something I was expecting to get """stoopid""" hops from"
"Feels a little thick and syrupy, nice carbonation though. Very tasty brew and I think I could drink several of these babies. This definitely the best brew I've had from Lagunitas."
"Nothing special to look at, but I'm warming to this brew. As I understand it, Lagunitas uses hope extracts instead of whole hops in the brewing process. Interesting. Yeah, I can see this as kind of a """Pliny Lite", with the same citrusy goodness but not nearly the depth of palette. I was amazed that this was an 8% ABV until I entered the """happy zone""" after nary a single bottle. The price is right, too. Hey, this is pretty good stuff!..."
"A great DIPA and a great reresentation of the style. Pours a nice amber with a thin tan head. The nose is fantastic. Crisp citrus hops over sweet bready malts. The taste does not have the huge explosion of hops I found in the nose. It is still well balanced. Medium body is a bit rough, but drinks well. Definetley a hop bomb."
"Hoppy, but not too raw. This is a delight for hop lovers, and at a very reasonable price."
"It went down smooth, and had that crisp bitter hoppy taste and biting/refreshing aftertaste that clears the head and satisfies to no end."
"This is one of the best over hopped beers I have had to date. It is well balanced and easy to drink. Well done."
"D: Very drinkable with a nice complex balance between the citrus and the pine notes. I've never considered price in a review, but this beer is outstanding and is much less expensive than many other Double IPAs that I enjoy."
"D) This is a fantastic Imperial IPA. The notes and observations documented do not do it justice. All I kept saying and thinking after each sip was """wow, this is an amazing beer!""""
"Reddish copper hued beer, with a large thick and frothy eggshell white head. Lashings of lace Very vital citric aroma, mostly orangy but lemon and lime are there,also herbal. Citric hop flavours mainlly, drying at the end, but this sure has a huge malt backing, its just that the hoppping is even huger! The bitter after taste is not as long lasting as I imagined. Very nice mouthfeel to it. A substantial brew in every manner, but strangely drinkable! I had no problems polishing off a bomber."
"Blipped """Totally Stupid""" by Teenage Bottlerocket"
"This tastes like it might be Pliny's bastard child, a little unrefined, but it's got good genes somewhere back there....And after finishing I took one last look at the bottle..A twist off bomber? Interesting.."
"The taste is different than some other DIPAs out there, a little less bitter with a nice blend of some faint tastes of fruit. Also, while you will have a good dose of hops on your palate, it does not overpower you with a rough aftertaste. Drinkability is above average, one to sip and savor."
"Due to the lack of overwhelming bitterness, this guy is surprisingly drinkable."
"D- Easy easy to drink, almost too easy!"
"M/D: this is a good beer and a worthy taster. it is not up to par with hopslam or maharaja but it does seem good"
"I can't say I could drink this all night, but I won't have a problem with this bottle. Its a good beer, very different."
"Mouthfeel is good for the style. The head is still hanging on admirably but it's not over-carbonated. Body isn't too heavy either. It's is surprisingly drinkable for something 8% with over 100IBUs."
"Extremely drinkable and very refreshing for the style."
"d: very approachable and drinkable hop bomb, would enjoy another"
"Not bad at all..."
"Really glad we get this in Chicago, and really glad I got to taste a fresh bottle."
"Tastes sweet, like honey and ginger ale with a touch of malt. Finishes with a citrus-y kick, not nearly as strong as I had hoped. Little too syrupy to be super refreshing but still awesome."
"The best part about this beer is its unique hop flavor. With a little less emphasis on the malts the hops might shine through. As is, it's only the bready sweetness and grassy character of the hops that turns me off from this beer."
"Overall a grat dipa that I would enjoy any day of the week. The sweetness gets to me after a few but still a great brew."
"A nice IPA from Lagunitas. Pours a nice amber with a thin tan head. The nose is fantastic. Crisp citrus hops over sweet bready malts. The taste does not have the huge explosion of hops I found in the nose. It is still well balanced, just more on the malty side. Medium body is a bit rough, but drinks well."
"Hop Stoopid feels like a brisk spring day along-side a lake in the White Mountains of New Hampshire--I feel a crisp wind and see majestic pine trees and crystal blue water. Experiencing it made me happy to be alive."
"D - I'm not sure I'm terribly crazy for this beer, but it has made for enlightening beer education. As for drinkability, I could see people who think they don't like hops, liking this 102 IBU beer, and being surprised for it. For me, though, this is too sweet. If I had wanted something hoppy and sweet, I'd have pulled a DFH 120 out of the cabinet. Indeed, this kinda brings to mind a weaker, less complex 120 Minute Mini-Me. Not sure I can finish the whole bomber...the wearisome sweetness is, well, wearing on me. Beyond the novelty of an unapologetic extract brew, this just hasn't kept me interested."
"D- very drinkable, one could get into a alot of trouble if they're not careful (stoopid maybe) one of the most quaffable DIPA's i've had"
"The mouth feel is quite easy. For hoppy beers it is light, sensitive to the pallet. IT really is a easy drinking beer and is a fantastic experience."
"Tastes grapefruit, light with tangy aftertaste. Great mouthfeel."
"Just about perfect."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, citrus/pines, slight raspberries? The taste is sweet, hoppy, nice malty notes, good touch of citrus, and some piney notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, a pretty tasty DIPA from Lagunitas. It's always a pleasure to have their reasonably priced beers, way to go Lagunitas."
"D- Very good but not quite sessionable everyday. Maybe a little bit more of a session brew for a hot day. Still a great beer!"
"D - Great overall. Could be improved with a little bit more bittering hops. Enjoyed this beer much more vs last year's version."
"Very drinkable, especially for a hophead's dream."
"Drinkability is good...plenty of hoppy goodness but civilized enough for the less enthusiastic hophead. The bottle I drank said 7.7% Alcohol vice the 8.2 listed on this site. Still not a session beer but something I would look forward to again."
"If I chance by a bottle I'd love to try it again and do a more proper review."
"The hop bitterness is real, but not shearing. The depth of flavor, however, seems stunted. What is here is singular, uncomplicated, simple, and without nuance. It makes for a drinkable, bitter ale. And something forgettable."
"D- Not so high in ABV, I could finish a bottle no problem. While alot of Lagunitas beers have a similiar taste profile this one is more on it's own path and deserves all accolades. Plus with the affordability of this (especially in a bomber size) I will be revisiting this soon."
"Where as some other DIPAs go for a bombardment of hops intensity that make you feel like you are chewing on a hop nugget (which I definitely like) this one is like hop flavored juice. I love DIPAs that have a huge hop bite, but this one has opened my eyes that not all hoppy beers need to be that way. This one is much more smooth and sessionable. This is not going to be my highest ranked beer, but it's definitely up there as one of my favorite beers due to sessionability, value, and flavor profile."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this is one I would recommend for sure."
"D - Yes, I am drinking the whole bomber and wish I had more!"
"On tap at UJ's Easter Hopfest. Appears a hazy golden amber color with about a finger of tight, off white foam. Smells and tastes of resinous pine, sweet caramelized malts, citrus fruits such as grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine. Excellent balance between hops and malt. Slight alcohol burn in the throat. Medium in both body and carbonation. Wonderful drinkability. My glass was empty in no time. Glad this shows up occasionally in bombers here as well."
"Hop Stoopid pours a copper color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is very hoppy, more citrus than pine although both are present. The flavor is all hops, citrus and pine both stand out. Malt is not really noticeable but is doing it's job in balancing things out. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: this one goes down easy for the style, but this big beer will catch up to you quickly after a few."
"Despite the relatively light mouthfeel, it was still a pleasure to drink and enjoy. I highly recommend this to any self proclaimed hop head. Enjoy!"
"D: If there were a 4.25 rating for taste I would say it would fit into this category. I am really enjoying this beer and what its offering up in terms of flavor and complexity but it seems so familiar and well worn and wonderful but I'm just not feeling it any higher than it is here."
"Nice drinking. I would like a little more carbonation with this type, but overall it is smooth and easy to do a few."
"drinkability: Pretty high up there, one bottle is enough though. These kind of beers are special treats for me these days, but I'm satisfied. I don't think Lagunitas can make a bad beer."
"Overall a nice brew but it's not as complex as I'd like. And I don't taste the 102 IBU. It's much mellower than that."
"I was really impressed by this beer's sweet citrus taste, it is one of the few that bring out a little tangerine flavor. The other nice thing is the price, less than $5 for a bomber for a great beer is awesome."
"A definite buy."
"Drinkability- Good, though slightly sweet."
"Pours a nice copper/orange color with small head and tons of lacing. Lots of bubbles floating to the top. Smell is very citrus-like.. one of the 'citriest' IPA's I have smelt. Taste has a great body and mouthfeel to it.. nice and wet. The bitterness is amazing and the citrus flavors really come out in the taste (pineapple/mango sort of taste?). Very different tasting for the style but oh do delicious. Awesome deal for the price and a great beer.. mucho kudos!"
"D - a very enjoyable brew, drink it while it's around and fresh."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my pint glass. Medium orange colour with a nice, soapy looking head. Smell is terrific! Delicious, candy sweet citrusy hops dominate with really nothing else in there I can detect. I also second the pineapple nuance from the review below this one. Fantastic! Taste is more pine resin-esque than grapefruit/citrus. The 8%+ abv in this is masterfully well hidden. This seems almost thirst quenching, as though I could just chug this thing. A very well crafted Imperial IPA. Highly drinkable especially considering the abv."
"The aroma has a wow factor with pineapple, grapefruit, biscuits, caramel, and an overall fruitiness. The appearance is deep gold with an amber hue. The head is large and fluffy. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall this is a great beer. I love it."
"Drinkability: An excellent IPA with plenty of hops. A strong hop bite and balance sweetness. Never seemed to bitter or overwhelming. Definitely a sipper though; one to enjoy. A must try."
"Pours a brilliant orange, one finger creamy white head, minimal lacing. The hops are noticeable in the nose but not overpowering. Nice hop/malt balance, a goodly bit of sweetness on the taste buds, hops are certainly there, but not overpowering like Ruination. Alcohol is warming but well hidden, pretty drinkable. I don't want to be blasphemous, but this is a relatively good comparator to Pliny, though depth of character isn't of the same level. All in all, this is a very, very good DIPA, and at this price, and outstanding value. Certainly worth seeking out."
"D: Quite drinkable, and a little on the lighter side as far as DIPA's are concerned. All of this is especially true given how cheap this is compared to most other available IPA bombers. Strangely enough, however, I think I prefer Lagunitas' Maximus to this."
"Lagunitas Hop Stoopid is a crystal clear light amber ale with a dense, foamy, oily white head that leaves solid, dense sheets of foam on the glass. It has a bright, strong, hoppy aroma of grapefruit and pine that's a touch sweet and possibly floral. It has a fluffy medium body that's lively with a dry finish. It's nicely bittered and very lightly sweet. This is a full flavored and refreshing beer. The flavor is mostly citrus and pine, but there seems to be a grassy, floral nuance to it. It's more flavorful than it is bitter, but it is quite bitter. It has a long, green aftertaste. This is how an IPA should be! Wow! This bomber was, like, four bucks!"
"OVERALL - I've heard complaints about Lagunitas using Hop extract instead of the real thing, but no down points on my end for this decision from me."
"There's a lot of hop flavor in this one but feels a little thin in body."
"4.5/4.5/4/4/4.5"
"MF good and I could drink this all day, I paid $4.99 for 22oz and in my opinion there is no better deal in NC right now."
" Seek this one out!"
"The flavor was a slightly sweet, almost shortbread like malt, and plenty of it, with a strong herbal, savory, and slightly piney hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel, and really smooth and drinkable for all that bitterness. Could not detect any of the 8.2% alcohol. One of those beers that's a joy to drank."
"The smell out of the bottle is very hoppy. Poured into a pint glass. Golden orange color with a full bubbles floating to the top. Nice hoppy flavor that's not overwhelming. Slight orange flavor with a very good mouthfeel. I was expecting something more hoppy with the 102 I.B.U. labeled on the bottle. Definitely has the double IPA taste but nothing thats overpowering. A very drinkable ale that I wish I had a few more to drink. Next time. Nice explanation about the hops on the labels. Always a good read during drinking and tilting the bottle to see it."
"D - Not strong on alcohol, strong on hops, but not overwhelming. While it's a good beer, its not great. Hops are strong, but on the weaker side and odd compared to most IIPA's. Good beer if you can get it for the right price, but not outstanding in any way."
"Great bitterness that lasts throughout the whole drinking experience. Nice bite that is slightly balanced by the grains but with the hops edging them out in the end. A dry finish that hints at a higher ABV but never fully reveals the 8.2% This is a solid beer that has a great scent but a not as good flavor. Not that there is anything wrong with the flavor, it's right up there."
"Overall, this was an excellent beer and I would highly recommend it."
"This is a nice DIPA. It is fantastic when you consider the price for the style."
"Give it a shot...or two."
"Drinkability, despite it's agressive hopping and unbalanced nature, is pretty good. I'd buy it again!"
"Definitely worth another purchase."
"d) the only lagunitas beer i have tried and enjoyed...and i enjoy it a lot"
"I have waited a long time to get some of this, and it was well worth the wait to say the least.Poured into a imperial nonic a slight hazed bronze color with a tight sticky one finger white head that left multiple rings of lace as it settled into a creamy mass atop.The hop complexity in the nose is outstanding,a healthy dose of grapefruit and apricot-like fruitiness,a hint of pine resin,and sweet alcohol and caramel all come together nicely.At first sip the grapefruit flavors really stick out and they just burst out at ya,mild alcohol dipped apricot flavors and some leafy/herbal flavors round out the hop profile,there is a slight biscuit sweet malt base but it never really cuts into the hops.Just fresh tasting and great,the alcohol is sneaky but I would drink this all night....and pay for it the next day."
"Well done!!!"
"This beer pours a hazy orange color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, orange, and pine resin. The taste is like the aroma...grapefruit, orange, and pine. I'm having a hard time detecting the 102 IBU (which should be hard to detect). I mean there is a nice bitterness to this beer, but it is not sharp the way very high IBU beers usually are. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but there a so many other DIPAs out there that taste just like it for it to stand out. I could drink it again though."
"D: If you like hops, this one is goes down easy. Me, I like hops."
"Thank you Lagunitas!"
"Not as tough to drink as I expected, but my hophead side has been showing up more and more lately. I wouldn't mind a couple more bottles of this one."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Hop Stoopid is overall a verygood DIPA"
"Poured into an oversized wine glass(as usual). Nice amber color with a huge 2 finger soapy white head. I could smell hops right away, bubble gum, citrus, very pleasant and inviting. Very nice taste, lots of hops again but nothing overpowering. Little bit of malt balances it out, nice carbonation. Little thin in the mouth for a DIPA but I have zero complaints. Only 7.7% so I could probably put a couple bombers down at one sitting if I wanted to. Price tag on the bottle says $3.99 and for that low price this beer is a hell of a deal. Most DIPA's are in the $10 range. Glad its finally rolling back into PA in the past few weeks. I will buy some more. Worth seeking out if you are a fan of hops."
"A fantastic beer. This one would go well with anything involving strong cheddar cheese. It should be the desire of any fan of beer to make this a must find."
"Pours a crystal clear light gold in color. A very nice inch of white head sits atop the beer. Smell is glorious floral hops. Just the way I like them. Plenty of sticky, webby lacing. This one has the mouthfeel that I love. The malt is behind the scenes and letting the hops take the main stage. Wow. I've not been too impressed with the Lagunitas stuff that I've had to this point, but this is one of the top beers I've had. Plenty of hop bitterness in the taste. Very clean and well done. I love this beer."
"Drinkability is good for hopheads only!"
"Another fine Lagunitas offering and a bomber worth picking up, even though it was nearly 5 bucks."
"Notes: A good beer with a hop kick and a touch of spice. Medium carbonation and easy enough to drink."
"Ok, maybe the flavour suffers a bit in comparison to the heady nose, but that's hardly an indictment. Also, the bittering effect of the 102 IBUs is actually a little less intense than I was expecting, but the overall drinkability of this doozy of an DIPA renders that a moot point. Hop Stoopid: will u marry me? My gf is ok w/ it (she better be, I shared it with her, and she liked it)."
"Other comments: The fruity elements in the aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible! Very tropical and lush. This beer teeters on the edge of needing a little more bitterness and being just right. At first it starts to be a little to fruity and sweet, but then it gets dried out just right by that quite perfect bittering level. I'm pleased that it's not overly bitter, as I expected it to be. This is damn good and would be really interesting to try on cask, if they even serve it that way."
"Wow. This is a fantastic beer. It belongs right up there with the best IPA/DIPA's out there. Almost surprised this Lagunitas, since I'm not always impressed with their offerings. This one is just fantastic however. A great hop balance, and sweetness. Great job. If anything, I am underrating this one. I would need to line it up against my favorite IPA/DIPA's in order to properly evaluate it. It's certainly in the conversation."
"pours a light orange/amber color with small head and average lacing...smell is pine and hop and citrus it smells good..the taste is better then the smell it is outstanding... it stars out with a hop smack and big pine and floral hits really delicious but not at all bitter at 102 ibu it then gives you a delicious hit of pine and grapefruit other herbs and floral flavors for the palette with a nice malt finish... this dipa packs an unbelievable flavor for 7.7 abv its is outstanding... iwill match it with hopslam,double trouble, 90 minute even pliny its that good... the mouth feel is the same..this is a great dipa that is way to drinkable... its one of my favorite dipas i highly recommend this one..less than $5 for the 22 oz bomber makes it a good buy i am not the biggest fan of langunitas brews but this should be their flagship"
"So far this is the best Lagunitas offering I've tasted. A great beer for hopheads with more than enough bitterness, aroma, etc., without double-digit ABV. A better-than-average price makes this a no-brainer."
"On the palate the ruby red grapefruit comes through, with delightful tartness, and other miscellaneous tropical fruits in the background. The mouthpuckering grapefruit never leaves center stage, however. Gentle biscuity malt is in the balance, but overall this is one whopper of a citrusy IPA."
"Wow, this is an interesting beer. I won't go as far as saying it's the best double IPA I've ever had, but I will say it's the most unique, and I dig unique. Very clear, vibrantly orange with a large and particularly fluffy and foamy head. This beer also has a lot of rising bubbles going on, like soda, and keeps it up almost the whole time it took me to drink it, which wasn't long. Again, unique. Super resiny lacing as well. Smells strongly of piney, citrusy hops. Taste however is much less bitter than I would have thought, given the pungent nose. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing. All hops. Big, luscious, juicy fruity pineapple melon mango hops. No pine bitterness at all as suggested on the first whiff. It's really crazy how much raw hop flavor this beer has yet such a low bitterness, though it claims 102 IBUs 4 U right on the label. Must have something to do with the hop extraction technique they used. Taking the actual physical hop out of the beer and adding it in extracted syrup form is an interesting idea, and I think they may be on to something. Slight honey sweetness (I hear it's infused with honey) and a faint pale malt. I could've easily given the taste a 5, but I tend to like bitter beers actually so I wouldn't mind a little more bite. But then it would just be another good but un-unique double IPA, and this beer is more than that. Super soft mouthfeel, light and airy. Almost feels like beer flavored air going down my throat. Highly drinkable can't get enough want it all the time. As a note, the label states a 7.7% abv while this site says 8.2%. This is truly a unique beer and I've really never had anything like it."
"OVERALL Not wicked filling considering its size, tasty, clean. Stands a bit above most of the the pack. A good value for the price. I think Maximus is my favorite of the Lagunitas IPA's."
"I was surprised to say the least. In an ocean of average to good brews this one surprised me. Love Hopslam? This one is as close as it gets. Citrus on the nose right off the bat, grapefruit. The 1st sip carries thru to the taste buds, from the fruity citrus nose. Love this stuff, and at a better price than Hopslam. One very worthy brew. Easily worthy of buying by the case, and there isn't many I would say that about. Let me be clear I do love this Ale, and the comparison to Hopslam is in regard to the style not the over all quality. Hopslam is truly unique."
"22oz bottle $4.29. One of the better DIPA's I've had in a while. Pours a very clean darkish copper with an medium head and decent carbonation. Aroma is big resin pine and citrus. Flavor is very crisp and fresh. More big pine, citrus rinds, malts. This is one of the most dry, bitter and surprising brews I have had in a while."
"A unique beer overall that really does hit the spot. Holds up to the hype."
"Overall a pretty good beer from a brewery I like a lot. Worth trying and having again, just not more than 1 at a time."
"Moderate mouthfeel, a little slippery, not overly full or creamy. Tasty beer, pretty drinkable, but something about it isn't coming together for me."
"All in all, I was a little perplexed with the difference between the nose and the overall flavor of this dipa, but as it warmed and the deeper into the bomber I got, the more I enjoyed this one. Will definitely revisit this one soon."
"Served into a tulip from a bomber this beer pours a nice golden orange hue with a 1 finger head that stays on the glass from start to finish. The smell is fantastic. I could pick up strong grapefruit notes, honey, and pine perhaps. The taste is bitter at first with a good sweetness to mellow it out. As this beer warms I am really liking how it becomes lighter on the palate. This is a fantastic Double IPA and should be bought when found."
"One would love to perch atop a hill and hear the piper in the fresh breeze, as this beverage was consumed. One would hardly believe the apparent level of bitterness, for it seems to be easily enjoyable, far too easy to throw back a twenty-two quickly. I close my eyes and picture the scene... A small price to pay for this experience. Four dollars, ninety-nine cents! A small price indeed."
"What can I say, you know why you bought this bottle--buy the ticket and take the trip--and it delivers the goods in a civilized hoptastic manner. A great DIPA, I'll definitely be going back for more."
"A gimmick beer, maybe, but Hop Stoopid is just stoopid enough to work."
"D: Okay, I want to start off by saying I really enjoyed this beer. It truly is a trip to Hop Town. Tons of hops just really assault your palate and really challenge your palate. The smell is amazing. The hops just pour forth. The only bad spot is that dry feel. Really kills the drinkability for me. It is almost a chore at times to finish this off. With that said, I finished and I survived, and I enjoyed the experience. For the price you can't beat it, and absolutely worth checking out. I know I will pick up another from time to time to kill my palate."
"D= Pretty high. The alcohol % is a little frustrating its so good actually. Really gonna enjoy this one and I'm very happy I decided to try it. Awesome beer."
"Over all, not exactly my thing, but certainly good for folks with a particular agenda. Amply named, since I can feel my neurons and dendrites getting humulene lube job."
"Drinkability: I now completely understand the hype behind this diamond in the rough of a beer, if you love hops, you'll fall in love with this beer. At 7.7 ABV and only $4.00 a bomber, this is by far the best beer for the money I've ever had. The aromas are unique, the hops blast your tastebuds like a machine gun, and it goes down so easily, it would be hard not to have another bomber of this in a sitting. Lagunita's has always been a favorite of mine, but this brew has solidified this notion. A beer that every hop head should have in their arsenal at ALL TIMES! Truly a masterpiece."
"Drinkability is insanely high for the style. Tastes so wonderful, but isn't so big and boozy that you have to drink it slowly. Such a delicious beer. I want to do a side by side with hopslam, because I honestly am not sure which I like more. Highly recommended."
"4.5 D: The taste is so damn good, that it almost eliminates the problems with the mouthfeel."
"Overall it's a very solid offering, but nothing stands out. I'd like to try this on tap and see if it's any better."
"1113"
"From the bottle this looks a clear golden color with a decent off-white frothy cap and goodly lacing. The aroma is crazy citrus hops, grapefruit and a weak hint of bready malt. The flavor follows suit with lemony grapefruit and an odd apricot. There's a twisted licorice but it's pretty much about the hop overload. A bit much for me without having any malt balance. But it's certainly worth a try for the hopheads. Nice body, fair carbonation, crisp and pretty unique. Just sort of mutated hops in the flavor here that makes it less drinkable for me. My second pint seemed a little friendlier so maybe I will warm up to it more. I like it but I am short of praising it entirely."
"Thanks for Reading"
"Overall, this was a super delicious beer that was very refreshing and easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"D - A very drinkable ale for the hearty hop lovers. Good job Lagunitas, another one for the hit parade!"
"Wow, a very well crafted brew, to pack in all this flavor and thickness and still not suffer from too much alcohol; very well done. A must try for the hop heads as this brew walks the IPA, DIPA line perfectly."
"D: Extremely tasty hop flavors in this one, without becoming the bitter bombshell the label suggested. I'm quite impressed by this, and Lagunitas has really been growing on me of late. Very good stuff."
"I thought this was a great DIPA. I almost walked out of the store without even noticing it, but I'm glad I did. It was only around $5 for a bomber. Not my favorite DIPA, but a solid offering that is worth trying."
"Clear dark amber with a very large three finger off white head. Very good amount of lacings. Aroma is big piney resinous hops. Taste is dark leathery citrus grapefruit orange hops with a just enough sweet rich malts. Mouthfeel is excellent and it is an easy drinker in spite of the 7.7% (on the label) abv. Exceptional beer. One of my new favorites in this style."
"D - In spades - wonderful!"
"Poured into a tulip- this one is a bright amber with a huge pillowy, off-white head. The smell is divine. TONS of citrusy, resiny hops dominate. Like smelling fresh squeezed tangerine with some weed thrown in. Stellar! Taste is similar- tons of citrusy and piney hops with a nice light malt backbone to not make you pucker. Good medium, slick mouthfeel and body. I could drink it all day. Send more my way!"
"Highly recommended..."
"This is a good DIPA, but not one of my favorites. However, I'd recommend this as a gateway to somebody who likes IPAs, but doesn't know much about DIPAs."
"D- Incredibly easy to drink."
"Pours out a golden, almost amber color with a big, white/off-white head. It's perfectly clear, and the bubbles look loose and float on top like clouds, and leaves minimal lacing. Looks pretty spot on to me. The smell is nice - tropical fruits, a bit of sweet citrus, lemon/lime, with a bit of hop resin and plenty of floral notes. I can even smell a bit of sweet, powdery malts. Overall a very good smell for a DIPA, but not overwhelming by any means. The flavor is good too. I actually don't get any hint of harsh bitterness as expected, but more of a resinousy bitterness, mixed in with quite a strong, sweet malty backbone, almost raisiny or honey-flavored. Very clean with plenty of hop flavor. There's the sweet fruity taste, like plums, apples, sweet lime, and mango. The resinous feel clings to my mouth and beer exits with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is quite nice, a bit powdery and not incredibly full, but the leafy hop presence is pleasant. The lower ABV, marked as 7.7%, mixed with the decent balance (for the style), makes this one a nice drinker. There are others I'd choose over this (only a few really), but really a great effort, recommended to all and a pretty good price for a DIPA."
"Pours an orange/amber color with a large white head that has good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Full of citrus aromas such as orange, grapefruit, tangerines, and pineapple. Big hop flavors as well. Mostly citrus with just a hint of earthy mustyness lingering in the background. That mustyness is the only hint of malt which does not seem to be important in this style. Bitterness is high without being overwhelming and harsh. Has a very good mouthfeel. Big body with low carbonation. Almost a soft texture which is unusual for a bitter brew. Almost all other brewers of DIPA's should figure out how Lagunitas got this mouthfeel. One of the better DIPAs out there but still is not something I will drink more than one bottle a couple times a year."
"pairs great with Joe Walsh's second studio album..."
"Overall, a very good imperial IPA. Great hop aroma and taste, and very easy to drink. Probably my favorite beer so far from Lagunitas, and very affordable at $4 a bottle."
"poured from a 22 oz bottle into a small tulip glass to keep in aroma then the rest into a pint glass, smells sweet at first more fruit than pine. looks like copper in a glass.minimal head and lacing. taste of hops envelopes the whole mouth with lingering bitterness thats not overpowering.this is a very good beer that i would buy again."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass a little warmer than normal (~55-60), to enjoy the hoppy aroma and let the flavor come out. The light copper color which it poured, turned out to be a bit stronger than it's looks let on. I was impressed at the drinkability of this delicious IPA, given its high ABV. It had a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness to the finish."
"Pours a amber tinted brown with two-finger white head that dies slowly and leaves lace everywhere. An unbelievable hop smell, with citric notes coming out as well as floral hops and hints of sweet malts. A very smooth, almost creamy medium-bodied DIPA that has a great hop bite to it (finishes dry) and is balanced w/ a slight sweet malt sensation. It is simple but effective; overflowing with hops, light sweet malts and a high ABV that is hidden means this is one classic DIPA that I need to stock up on."
"Extremely drinkable, very tasty, and priced cheaply enough to make it a certain favorite. I think I paid $3.99 for this 22 oz bottle at Green's in Atlanta. Nice to see a world class DIPA at an affordable price."
"You gotta love Lagunitas, huh? The appearance rating goes up to 5 not just because of the lovely dark gold liquid inside, but because of the label. Is it a parody of some American nativist painting? An in-joke about the """stoop"""? I tell you, I'd even give an extra point for the doggie on the cap. Lagunitas just takes such care of its beers from the outside in and the bottom up. I don't work there or have anything to do with the company! And I live in Portland, where we have so many fine brewers. But I'll grab any new Lag I spot at the store. And that's another big thing to love -- Lagunitas is always coming out with new and special beers. And (unlike many other brewers) they keep 'em all at the same price, even the high-gravity, high-hops ones. Like this beaut, Hop Stoopid. I tried it at a beer festival this summer and dug it. Finally get to peacefully drink 22 oz in my own home. Hops galore, lotsa alcohol too, but all so gracefully blended into the full experience. Even if you don't usually like the IIPAs you might try this one. Real nice and well-mannered through its fierceness -- if other IIPAs are wild beasts, this one is a friendly but scary watchdog -- like that doggie on the bottlecap. Cheers!"
"Way above average IIPA out there, and for the price it's outstanding. Rich hope pine fruit thick texture. Nice persistant balanced finish. Bitter is intigrated. Really a bold big IIPA that is still balanced. Becoming my favorite IIPA for the price / consistancy / deliciousness."
"Feels light and clingy in the mouth. I could probably drink a dangerous amount of this beer. I like it."
"Very easy drinking for the high ABV, I can do a bomber of one of these, no problem! Great stuff, probably my favorite offering from Lagunitas although I really dig their Brown Shugga too!"
"Fifty degrees from a bomber into a Kapuziner glass. Nose is pure grapefruit fading to pineapple. Nice creamy thin head, with thick arms of lace. Front of sip pure grapefruit, finishing earthy, dry, just a hint of pine and sweet malt. Mouthfeel excellent, not overly resinous, carbonation perfect. Goes down easily, perhaps overly so, alcohol hidden in the fine balance of flavor. Nose becomes more pineapple as it warms, and finish begins to add more malt to the mix. A wonderful beer, better than Moylander and Double Dog, the only others of this style high ibu I've enjoyed. 3.69 at Hannaford, you can't go wrong with this one!"
"Bottle from the Davis Co-Op. Pours a nifty orange brown, clear and sparkling. Big pillowy, draft-like head with crusty lacing. Smells strongly of grapefruit and mangoes. Resin filled hops and sweet malt. A real pleasure on the nose. Flavor is a winner too. More grapefruit, more mango, some tangerine and pine...all on top of a nice sweet malt base. Very, very tasty. Bitterness obvious on the first couple of sips but settles down afterwards to more of an afterthought. Medium to full bodied...creamy, velvety. Lagunitas is very hit or miss for me, but this one is a home run. Awesome IIPA, a cut above some of the other big ones out here on the west coast, which is saying something."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a deep golden hue capped by a small creamy white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Strong, acrid hops dominate the aroma, with notes of grass and cannabis and a very mild biscuity sweetness in the background. Palate is full of bitter, floral hops up front, balanced by a faintly sweet malt character. Finish is full of grass and grapefruit, with a lasting bitterness. Body is slightly sticky, just about perfect for the style. While the alcohol isn't exactly integrated, it's not really a problem. This is one of the more assertive imperial IPAs I've had recently, and at under $4/bottle, I'll definitely be buying more soon."
"I will drink this whole bomber quite quickly. This is a very good beer, and probably the best thing I've had from Lagunitas yet."
"Future outlook: This was fantastic. I'm sure I'll want to give it another whirl sometime."
"D: Not too shabby, for 102 IBUs it isn't nearly as intense as I figured, a really tasty beer, and I'm glad I bought more than one! I'll recommend this one."
"the last sonoma farmhouse i had from Lagunitas was incredible (saison) and with what i have heard from a couple of people, I am looking forward to this ... pours out a dark kettle brown, with medium head issues, lacing is good too ... very flavourful hop bite, solid and rewarding, very clean, 5 iron huh? well you're fired ... is super tasty! .. a very well made brew that is sure to please any hophead.... 102IBU4u!"
"Drinkability is perfect - as long as it's cold (like very DIPA should be). Let it warm, it gets syrupy. Even though this is my ideal flavor profile in a DIPA, the hop flavor is still super huge yet clean, the body isn't to heavy, and it's smooth. And like all Lagunitas beers, it's priced for the proletariat - beer for the people, Laga-fuckin-nitas indeed! These guys might be my favorite CA brewery (or period), considering overall value and variety of awesome beers."
"Overall... very impressed. This stands out over Deschutes Hop Henge for me as well as Full Sails Slipknot. Great job Lagunitas."
"*Public Enemy"
"Overall I would say this is a pretty average DIPA pretty damn good for the price though."
"D- This is a wickedly good DIPA with tons of tropical and citrus notes just the type of DIPA I like. It could be even better if it had a touch more body but this is definitely a brew to seek out."
"Overall, a good showing from Lagunitas. I've become very disenchanted with their beers as of late (the atrocity that is the Cappuccino Stout nearly forced me to stop drinking Lagunitas alltogether) and this is a refreshing reminder of the importance of trying everything a brewery has to offer before condemning the brand."
"A bargain at $5.99 at Blacklick Liquor in Reynoldsburg."
"Booya. This could be the surprise of the year so far. Exceptional in every way and tasting pretty damn fresh. Clean, pure hopping with some malt to balance and just enough bitterness. Reminds me of Pliney. Yum."
"Lighter mothfeel than expected but it matches the disarming fruitiness and floral bouquet. No sing of the alcohol. Excellent beer and at 4.99 for a bomber probably the best price/quality ratio I've come across lately."
"D: A good DIPA, but not the first I'd grab from my co-op's cooler."
" Get Some!!!"
"It's tasty indeed...a solid, intersting effort for the """Mobil 1""" of hop bombs. Still I'd almost prefer a little rustic malt with a bit of true hop texture to add more character. Drinks more slowly than expected but quite enjoyable. I want to taste this blind because it just has that test tube aura to it."
"If you are a hop lover, this is a great beer. Does not dissapoint!"
"For what it is, I think this is a well done from Lagunitas. They ventured into the heavier IPA world and came out alright."
"I'm pretty blown away. Not many double IPAs can pull off such flavors so cleanly, without any noticeable off flavors or defects. The alcohol is subtle, the flavors bright, and the drinkability incredible. I'd definitely polish off a few more bottles were they in front of me. One of the best Lagunitas bottles I've had the pleasure of trying."
"Crystal clear light copper body. Good sized ivory white head caps it off and has good staying power. Lacing is quite full as well. This has a great aroma. Very fruity and tropical. Apricot pulp and nectarine and tangerine....Definitely some pineapple too...Awesome. Flavor starts out bright and fruity. Bigtime pineapple and some fleshy tangerine too. Bitterness is quite clean for a beer of 100+ claimed IBUs. Biscuity malt base does it's job, but the bright, vibrant hop flavors really shine here...even if it does create a slightly one sided DIPA. Very enjoyable and a little too easy to put back. This bomber could be gone all too quickly."
"Hop Stoopid is an excellent DIPA. I'm really enjoying it. I probably appreciate it even more given my recent bad experiences with DIPAs that are way too heavy on caramel malts. Lagunitas got this one just right. Highly recommended."
"Thick and resinous, low carbonation. A steroid enhanced version of the bottle. Definitely a good whippin' from the hop vine. Thank you sir, I'll have another."
"Drinkability- Lots of big bitter hops equals plenty to chew on, still went down easy."
"Very drinkable hop-bomb that fits the West coast standards in a big IIPA way. As it says on the label: 102I.B.U.4U., thats some hops!"
"This was one of the best I had at the EBF, so I needed to get some. Thanks to Matt at Winchester W&S for letting me know exactly when it was due to arrive. Poured in to a snifter a near perfect clear orange, with two fingers of pillow like white heading. Nice pungent hops start off in the smell. The hops stay prevalent, but there is also some sweet cream involved here, along with some mild tobacco. Taste is once again dominated by resiny, piny hops...truly hop juice. At the same time it is not so overwhelming as to ruin your taste buds after drinking it. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with great carbonation, and lots of subtle nuances as the beer warms up some. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for me. This West Coast Imperial IPA is as good as any out there that I have tried. Exceptional by all standards, but the cheap price tag places it on its own. Cheers"
"D: Drinks nicely, goes down easy for the high ABV. Wonderful beer."
"D: very tasty I drank a bomber very quickly, I could see the sweetness getting a little old after a couple bottles"
"I find this to be more of an Amber Ale with lots of fruity notes which makes it a bit different but one I will definitely grab again if I see it on the shelf."
"Drinkability: Meh, not that great. Lots of herbal hops, which is cool, but seems to be lacking complexity. I'm not even sure if I like the flavor to be honest. Forgettable."
"notes- good balance, hop sweetness, no hop bitterness in the finish, good beer, a little sweet"
"You can't beat the price on this big beer, as well. Check it out!"
"I hear this is the replacement for Maximus...and boy if it is what a great replacement!"
"The name says it all, drink this baby and you are skipping down the road to hop stupidity; a must for hop heads. If you are looking for balance, look elsewhere - I digress."
"Whole Foods/ $6/22 oz"
"Picked up a couple of bottles upon arrival at the store. The beer pours a crystal-clear amber with a one-inch head that settles to a few millimeters. Carbonation is vigorous, but very fine. The aroma is extremely hoppy. Citrus notes and pine overwhelm all, but there is a sweet malty note in the backround. The taste is very green with hops. Grapefruit and pine are distinct, along with other fruity flavors. It finishes dry, yet balanced with malt. This beer is medium bodied, and resinous hops coat the palate and linger for a long time after each sip. Hop Stoopid is a beer suitable for any hophead. 102 IBUs at only 7.7% ABV? Somehow this works. And the price is very reasonable as well."
"D: A good DIPA but nothing too special. I like Lagunitas Maximus a lot more and there are obviously plenty of other DIPAs out there."
"Drinkability: Nothing transcendent, but a very good offering, especially for the price. Fitting for the hophead and also, weirdly enough, the casual DIPA drinker. Lagunitas continues making great brews."
"D - Damn. This is one fine DIPA. The first time I had this beer was at a brewfest up in Novato. I recall being extremely impressed at the time then failing to ever pick up a bottle. When I saw this on the shelves of my local BevMo, I knew I needed to give it a shot. Very well done. Loads of hop flavor, tons of bitterness, excellent dry finish. It ain't quite Pliny the Elder but this beer is getting damn close. Kudos to the folks at Lagunitas for making one of my new favorite Imperial IPAs."
"D: $5.99!? With the outrageous price of hops this seems like a bargain. I think this is a good DIPA, but the market is huge and I would seek alternatives. Solid beer that did not dissapoint."
"On to the taste, and damn, is it just like the smell. Nicely sweet with tons of hop presence. Smooth and creamy with very little carbonation in the mouth. Rich and creamy and delicious and one of my new favorite beers."
"D: Piney and bitter when cold. Much more drinkable when cellar temperature. Not too bad when in the mid-60's, either. I'd drink it again."
"This poured a clear gold color with off-white head. It smelled like strong pine hops, with rose and potpourri notes, and a bit of honey. It tasted like pine and rose hops with some juniper and fresh peppercorn, and lingering honey sweetness. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a smooth bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty interesting beer, almost like if Sierra Nevada made an imperial IPA but better. It had that same pine character, but it was brewed with much more skill and delicate touch than Sierra tends to provide. The beer seems like an unbalanced hop bomb at first, but then it ends with incredible malty sweetness, and an overall very clean taste. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol well under the big flavors. This beer is better to sip, but is very enjoyable to drink. Great value, too!"
"Let's get to it. I didn't like this much; at least in comparison to the classic IPAs from Stone and Bells. I didn't get big citrus and pine. SOME sour grapefruit, but more sharp cheddar and sourness. Over the top hops with little malt--which is fine with me....when the hop taste is yummy. This was sharp, sour, but also bland. I have had a lot of citrus/piney IPAs and I don't get that from this brew like other reviewers did. I won't be revisiting this."
"Poured a copper color with no visible head. Smells of sweet citrus hops and has a nice hop burn as it travels down the throat. Taste is bitter citrus and pine hops and has a light body. Alcohol is well hidden and is very drinkable. Good value for the money although not a top contender for favorite DIPA."
"Easily the best Lagunitas beer I've had. Asprin, cat pee, citrus, more of a malt prescence in the middle bready in character but this beer is all about wonderful juicy ass grapefruit. Throughout the entire palate from beginning to middle and long into the finish. Nice bitterness wth a mouthfeel that stays in tact and leaves a drying sensation but nothing acrid like many DIPA's I've sampled recently have been. Great priced as well. I'll be buying a case of this beauty."
"Pours a clear coppery color with a large white foamy head. This is a good,not great looking beer. The smell is very pungent with a huge citrus hop aroma. The taste is very good with a gigantic blast of citrus hops. I feel like I just had a sip of grapefruit juice with alcohol in it. Along with the citrus hops, there is some hop bitterness to this. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a big bottle of juicy grapefruit hops. Enjoy."
"Plus, at under $5 per bomber this is a fucking steal!"
"Pale orange, steady stream of large CO2 bubbles, white head and decent lacing. Big time pine sap aroma. Mmm mmm, this is how I like my DIPAs. Yes, there's some sweet maltiness in the nose, but it's completely out done by the pine and light citrus. Flavor is pretty good. For 102 IBUs I was expecting a lot more bitterness, but this is more hop flavor than bitterness to me. It's mostly pine with maybe some hints of citrus, and solid pale malt backbone with a biscuit/cracker like character. Medium to full bodied, average carbonation. Pretty easy to drink actually, and the 7.7% ABV doesn't weigh you down. A nice DIPA, but nothing great."
"Hop Stoopid is still a great beer. I would say the old 8.2% version was a 4.5 for both smell and taste. Can't complain though due to its reasonable price point ($3.69 before tax and CRV)."
"Drinkability is just short of a five. Maybe it should be. It goes down like a lager on a hot day and never gives notice to the abv. I'm on the fence as I just powered through the bomber. Good stuff here. If you are into sessioning DIPAs this is a good one."
"Cheers..."
"Overall, pretty tasty. If this is indeed made with 100% hop extract and no leaf/pellet hops, then I would consider this to be pretty damn impressive. My biggest complaint is that all of the Lagunitas brews are beginning to taste like the same thing over and over... You do it well, but come on... give us something new."
"This is a pretty well balanced DIPA. It doesn't destroy your palette and balances well. It's very drinkable despite the higher alcohol content."
"T + M + D: Not tongue tearing bitter - a sweeter, but slightly sharp flavour of grapefruit, quite similar to grapefruit juice, actually. It's a pretty nice tasting beer without the aggressiveness of some others. Alcohol is very well hidden and really nice to drink. Body is medium and a little slick with a sting of carbonation to open."
"Pours a light amber thats slightly cloudy. There is a 1/4""" soapy white head that quickly recedes to a fine ring. The smell is cut grass and pine up front, actually right from the bottle upon opening but upon further sniffs there is a strong alcohol and sweeter citrus and malts. The taste is hoppy, pine and citrus with a strong alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is smooth and full and the drinkability is strong even with the high, noticeable alcohol. Overall a great hoppy beer."
"Purchased at Green's(Buford Hwy) in Atlanta. Beer pours a beautiful copper/gold with not much head. Smells of citrus and malts. The taste begins a little sweet but soon the citrus hops and malt flavors hit you. I'm a big fan of well balanced beers and this beer does not disappoint. Alcohol is well hidden in this tasty brew. Recommended."
"I am having better and better double IPAs, this being one. Its well hopped, and the flavour comes through well supported by the malt backbone, without killing my palate. Very drinkable, even at lunchtime. Not complex, more high IBU hopping, enjoyable nevertheless. Good head and lace. Above average mouthfeel."
"Notes: I really liked the flavors that Hop Stoopid had to offer. And, you just can't beat the value of this hoppy of a beer at 8.2%. But, the mouthfeel was a disappointment for me. I just think that a fuller body would have built a stronger wall of flavor for the palate to indulge in. But overall, this is very good beer."
"Poured bomber into a pint glass. Color of a somewhat lightly dark orange haze with minimal head appeared. Big aromatics are displayed the moment the cap is opened. Smells of orange/lime citrus with pine characteristics. A perfectly hoped brew that is a little thicker in nature, but after it is a double. Could pass for a 6% ABV. Very drinkable.... 22 oz. does not give this beer justice. Recommended."
"It's very similar as it was on tap. I like the feel a bit better this time around, but that might just be the day or my present state of mind or something. There is not a big difference between the serving types, anyway."
"Overall, this is one awesome west coast brew. Very glad that I picked this one up of the shelves. Definitely a must try if you are a fan of Pliny the Elder."
"Possibly up to Triple IPA standards, this one is a punch in the mouth after another. By the way, the alcohol is well hidden. When fresh, the hops are razor sharp. It seemed hard to set this one down. Recommended."
"*Highly* drinkable, it goes down awfully smooth for a DIPA. ABV gives no indication in the taste that it's there."
"D - Easy drinker here if you're a hop head."
"Tap at Boulder Strong Ale Fest and GABF. Poured hazy yellow with massive, as in most of the glass is filled with foam when pouring, frothy off white head. Smelled slightly citrusy with mostly massive pine smells. Tastes as one person described it """like eating a Christmas tree", fantastic beer if you like that sort of thing. Easily one of my favorite imperials."
"Well-crafted, tasty beer."
"Drinkability= High. Good mouth feel, nothing is over the top. The smell and taste could be juiced up. 8.2% is not noticeable."
"Drinkability: IMO Lagunitas makes some of the most drinkable beers I've tried. This is no exception. I wish I could find six packs of this stuff. Definitely an excellent brew."
"This DIPA has, for me, the perfect balance of citrusy hops and sweet malts. I absolutely love the taste and the super crisp hop bite. The drinkability is great for a high alcohol beer. This is just a well crafted beer that is another delicious addition to the Lagunitas lineup."
"Tap @ The Local. Pours clear orange-gold with a bubbly white head. Rich hop aroma of grapefruit, tangerine, pine, and lemongrass. Bold, fresh taste. Lots of citrus, with the tangerine taking the forefront. Very crisp and refreshing without overpowering. Love the resiny hops with the caramel malt taking a backseat and not making this some syrupy sugar nightmare. Dare I say, one of the best DIPA's I've ever had."
"at the end of the day - this beer rocks!go Lagunitas!"
"This is a standout beer."
"An excellent beer!!!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and well carbonated. The tastes stick to the mouth and leave a very pleasant bitterness. Very easy drinking by DIPA standards with the alcohol being very lightly noticeable."
"M/D - all in all, a very good beer. I like the bitter, but it might keep it from being a very drinkable beer. But I do like my hops and enjoyed this one from start to finish."
"D: I was very tempted to give this beer an A+ rating. I'll have to try this a few more times to see if I would consider it a top 5 IIPA. Regardless, this is an amazing beer and it will be my opener on Thanksgiving Day."
"D: High. Too high. Dangerous. (I like 'em that way!) This and the New Dog Town Pale Ale and the Imperial Red are making up for Lagunitas otherwise piss poor line up IMO."
"Hops and sweat malt hold hands and sing campfire songs in sweet melody with one another. Yes, thats my way of saying its balanced."
"Got this on tap at Union Jacks, a corner bar in Manayunk outside of Center City, Philadelphia. Wouldn't have guessed it was a double because it was so smooth and didn't carry the sweetness of most double IPAs. One of the best beers I've had in the last few weeks. Great hoppy bite and minimal malty flavor. The color was good, the smell was solid. If you likes hops, you can't miss this beer, you won't regret it."
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. A beautiful deep gold color with a rocky off white head. Aroma is amazing with hops - citrusy and a little spicy, orange grapefruit. Firmly bitter, but still has a grainy malt character. Medium bodied, light for a beer this strength. Finish is dry and cleans the palate. Some lingering bitterness, in a good way. This is one of the best Imperial IPAs that I've ever had. Not cloyingly sweet, not abusively bitter. Extremely hoppy, but balanced and drinkable."
"Thanks again gford217!"
"A very drinkable, enjoyable beer."
"Hop Stoopid (love that name), pours a bright golden orange color with a medium sticky, just off white head with lots of spiraling rising carbonation. Pungent and citrusy hops create a medley of aromas including notes of almond, hay, and a looming earthy funk quality. Hoppy as hell, but a great balance of the hops, very bitter-sweet. Coating sweet malts balance the fresh and citrusy yet resinous and piney hop overload and create a long pleasant aftertaste after its dry and fruity finish. The nose continues to get even more farm house funky as it opens up, also new notes of peach, melon, strawberry, and floral yeasty esters come through. Mellow carbonation overall but just enough to still deliver a strong bite, instead of the beer falling dull in the mouth. Medium body, decent chew and excellently coating. Impressive drinkability, alcohol heat is no where in sight. Truly a wonderful beer from Lagunitas i wish we got here in NJ."
"Pours a rich gold-amber, with a creamy head and a muscular, but not overpowering, floral-citrus aroma. This is a well-balanced DIPA, not too sweet, and bitter in the English style with modest but evident carbonation. As it warms, that bitterness becomes even more apparent on the back of the tongue, and smoky, pine resin flavors emerge. A good Thanksgiving beer, and good, I'm sure, with roast fowl of any sort, and smoked cheese. I had mine with smoked Gouda--a perfect combination."
"D: This is 8.25%? Incredible for the style though I'm sure I'll be feeling a nice buzz after I finish all 22 oz."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a dark-golden color with a decent frothy off-white head, fair lacing. Aroma is mainly pine, resiny hops with a touch of caramel malt. Taste is a nice mix between pine and citrus as far as hop flavor is concerned, nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is astringent, good carbonation. Good beer."
"Rather thin as well, not watery but not the bigness I would expect. Drinkable for sure if you love hops. I do. Oddly this seems like a sub-par offering from a great brewery, and the twist-off cap adds to this effect. I say oddly, because it's still a pretty damn good beer."
"Overall- Nicely balanced between the malt and hops, not as bitterly overpowering as some doubles. Very easy to drink!"
"Had on tap at the Muddy Pig in St Paul Mn. Served in a shaker pint. Poured a hazy orange with a one finger head. Minimal retention with minimal lacing. Big pungent citrus and pine hops. A slight malty sweetness evident in the aroma as well. Taste is all hops, all day. Resinous pine and grapefuit with a touch of pineapple. Sweet malts help to balance the giant hop character. Bitterness is quite agressive and lingers on your tongue for some time. Carbonation was medium, as was the body. Highly drinkable and on par with the best DIPAs Ive had. Hides the alchohol well. I hope we will see this again, as it was supposedly only on for the one night."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, considering the style. Would be a sure choice to satiate a healthy hop hunger in the future."
"Served on tap at it's Minnesota introduction at the Muddy Pig in St Paul, this pours a clear amber color , with a minimal white head that fades quickly, leaving a small amount of white lacing on the glass. The smell is primarily(and richly) of piney hops. The taste is both of intense pinety and citrussy hops, with an exceptional balancing malt flavor. For a beer as hoppy as this is(100+IBU's), it is extremely balanced. This is a hop lover's dream come true, yet it has enough malt balance to please almost everyone. The mouthfeel is rich and tasty. I'm so glad this beer finally hit Minnesota. Here's to the Golden Age of beer drinking!"
"D: Well, this isn't the hop-bomb I was looking for, but a pretty nice IIPA at any rate. I will say that the hops got stronger the more I drank. And I do like a malty IIPA. I just wish the hops were a little more in your face. For those who want a well balanced and mellow IIPA, this is a great beer. It's just not over-the-top enough for me."
"-Overall 4.1"
"A: Popping the top on this one resulted in a little foam over, 1/2 centimeter of foam from a rigorous pour, crystal clear beer, the color of honey with a copper hue - 3.75, S: The aroma hit me from a couple of feet, a strong and pungent, resiny hops, quite delectable - 4.50, T: An extremely concentrated brew, some grass & pine from the hops, quite bitter, some subtle syrupiness - 4.50, M: Silky clean - 4.75, D: Quite an enjoyable brew, packed with flavors, one I'd go back to - 4.00"
"Overall a different twist DIPA that was very enjoyable. I have one more to try and I look forward to it. Nice beer."
"Pours a clear orange amber with a creme head. Nose is piney citrus. Flavor is like drinking pine sap mixed in with beer. Extremely hop forward and all up in your mouth. No attempt at balance whatsoever. It just screams in your mouth. Huge amounts of oils. Slick feel on the liquid and the carbonation is slightly lower. Surprisingly easy to drink despite how much of a hop bomb it is. Still more of a sipper though."
"I heard this stuff was over 100 IBUs and was orginally skeptical about that figure but I believe it now, this stuff is super hoppy and reminded me of Obliteration from Midnight Sun a little bit, cannot go wrong for the price, will be drinking again, recommended"
"Thanks again Grant, definitely enjoyed this one a second time."
"on tap at Toronado san fransisco mid September. Golden pour with orange highlites, good smelling brew - fresh pine. Taste- medium bodied with full malt presence to go along with hop assault. Hops not overwhelming but still have a nice kick. Pretty balanced for a hefty dipa"
"Overall, an excellent and well-balanced beer. It't not hops for the sake of hops, and I wish I had bought more than two..."
"I had a bottle of this in Atlanta. Purchased based on name and also the fact that it's made by Lagunitas. The beer was clear orange with loads of foam. The smell was wildly good, tons of hops complexity. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, maybe some orange or lemon. The taste is primarily from the hops, this isn't the type of DIPA with excessive malt balance. Delicious, I liked this even more than Maximus. The only odd thing I noticed was sort of low carbonation, odd because there was a lot of foam on pouring. But it wasn't really stale feeling, it just could have had more mouth presence. Anyway this is a solid beer."
"Medium-bodied and lightly-carbonated. Drinkable, but not overly so. Meh."
"D- While this was quite a treat, my hats off to anybody who can drink more than one of these in a night."
"I highly recommend. Great lively mouthfeel."
"This is the best beer I've had from Lagunitas and a damn good IIPA. If this was available in my area I would pick it up often. Thanks for knocking one off my """wants""" and hooking me up with such a great beer Dyan!"
"Wow! One of my favorite hoppy beers in a bottle, the mix of big sweetness and bitterness work extrememly well together, creating one nicely balanced and drinkable DIPA. I really need to go grab another bottle of this and enjoy while it's still fresh. Great stuff!"
"drinkability: good"
"burnt orange, white head, decent retention/lace. gorgeous nose, with piney hops leading the way and fruity hops mixed with fruity and sweet malt in the back. taste is more of the same, and the imbalance is actually coming off as balance for a west coaster to me. i like it. medium body. perfect amount of carbonation. go lagunitas!!! a wonderful provider of world class beer that remains affordable against all odds."
"Very much recommended, especially since I had that much fun from a bottle available at a store here in Maryland all the way across the country and it still came across incredibly fresh."
"Considering all the high marks this beer has received, I am wondering if this was a bad bottle. However, there are so many brilliant IPAs on the west coast that it is likely I will not give this a second try if there is something else available."
"Pours a brilliant orange-amber into the glass with a tight, white head. Fair lacing sticks to the glass while receeding. Smells pretty good. As one would suspect, hops comes to the forefront ans does a little citrus. Hops dominates the tongue and the alcohol warms up the throat on the way down. mothfeel is a little heavy. One might finish the whole bottle but your tastebuds would be shot and you would need to move on to a more dominating taste if you keep drinking. Overall, a really good beer."
"D: Extremely sessionable. You'd be stoopid not to have another."
"8.2% and the alcohol is quite deceiving. Very good and unique DIPA that's easy to imbibe."
"How stoopid is it, with the hops? I've had hoppier, from Lagunitas, as well, I think. And what's with this Sonoma Farmhouse Ale thing...sure, I get that means that it's a WEst Coast hop bomb, we all get that....is there an inside joke here, that no one's telling me?"
"Overall I was impressed with this beer. Looks great, smells good, and tastes great. Check this out if you can."
"For the cost, Lagunitas makes some nice brews. I'd happily have this again."
"Another above average offering from one of my favorite West Coast breweries. Definitely recommended."
"2009 edit: The fresh bottled version was great, review forthcoming..."
"Into an imperial pint glass, pours a lovely golden copper, nice head and tons of lacing. The aroma is quite nice, lots of pine and hop oils, some grapefruit among other citrus. Taste is all the better, just oozing with hops, the oils, the pine, just a bomb. After each sip, I want another, immediately. The mouth is slick, good carbonation, very drinkable, extremely drinkable. Goodness, I want another..."
"It;s a slow drinker, not just because of the abv, but just the sheer flavor and viscosity here."
"This one pours a nice orangy amber with a decent yellowish-tan head. Aroma is quite strong and so hoppy that it smells a lot like a pine tree. Flavor is seriously hoppy, with some hints of fruit but not too much bitterness. Texture is not smooth, but it is still pleasant to drink, especially if you are a hops fanatic."
"Probably my favorite offering from Lagunitas."
"The beer poured a deep, clear amber with a thick, rocky, white head into a pint glass. The smell was an intensely piney whiff of fresh hops - heavenly. The taste was a beautifully balanced blend of big, fresh hop flavor up front with a nice malt sweetness in the background. One of the best balanced IPAs I've ever had. The lacing down the glass was thick and luscious. This has replaced Kill Ugly Radio as my favorite Lagunitas brew."
"Drinkability: It was a pleasant experience, but I was one-and-done with this beer. It would be nice to share again with the """uninitiated"""."
"On tap at Coles. This beer smells awesome. Lots of fresh, juicy hops. This beer is glowing in appearance and aroma. Sticky grapefruit, pine and mango. This beer loses nothing throughout the pint and gets better as it warms up in the sun. By far the best Lagunitas beer I've ever had."
"D - wow, as good as I recall! This a massively hoppy and delicious DIPA. Lagunitas are so awesome. Definitely try this on draft if you can, but the bottle version really is quite excellent. So very hoppy. Really hitting the spot before I go to a cookout in a bit. Get it!"
"Pours a clear golden amber with a thin, dense head that dissipates leaving a slight swirl of foam on top and spots of lacing along the way. Smell is massive with green floral hops, pine resin and grapefruit jumping out of the glass and attacking my nose. Seriously big fragrant hop aroma! The taste also starts with fruity hops, mostly grapefruit and apricots, but has a bit more biscuity malt presence than the aroma. The finish brings back the pine for a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky with hop oils and good carbonation. This is a great DIPA and the best offering I've had from Lagunitas. When you factor in the price, this is absolutely one of the best beer values on the market."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Moderate alcohol, and decent flavor really make this beer easy to drink."
"Powerful brew, pours golden yellow and clear with good head of white foam. Sour, fruity hops explode on first taste. Pleasant, bitter aftertaste lingers. This is like my standby, Sweetwater IPA, on steroids. An excellent beer worth having on hand. Yowsa!"
"D: If you like hops this is for you. It is a drinkable hoppy brew, that I wish had come to Florida with the rest of their lineup."
"Drinkability is moderate, amazing aroma and hop flavors, nicely balanced with the pale malts, definitely a solid west coast DIPA with low alcohol presence"
"I rue the fact that this is unavailable to me here in TN. This would be my go to IIPA without a doubt."
"According to the Josh the owner, there is only five (5) of these kegs in the State of Massachusetts...and they have three (3) of them. Head on over before they are all gone!!"
"Didn't know about this beer until it was recommended to me. Big one inch head . Wonderful aroma - heavyhops, herbs, grass (farmhouse) tons of grapefruit and orange. Initial flavor was moderately sweet and a tad bitter. Long finish. Pleanty of that freash hop taste and aroma. This was really great."
"Sonoma Farmhouse Hop Stoopid Ale by Lagunitas, which is quite a mouthful for a moniker, came in a 22 oz. brown bomber with a rustic scene on the label to match the name. I usually love the way IPAs look, and this one did not disappoint with a clear gold, bubbly body, holding up a two finger thick head. The smell was citric hops with a small dose of pine resin. I was expecting the taste to be like their Maximus, but this was a lot more assertive with an up front bitterness, toasty caramel malt, and a lingering finish. The body was a little thin for DIPA, but that's hardly ever the point of the style anyway. Not sure why this is described as a """traditionally brewed non-traditional ale""" on the label, but some traditions are well worth keeping any ways."
"Drinkability: This Double IPA from Lagunitas should please those hop heads out there."
"D: Deliciously drinkable IPA. Love the hop character and I could drink 3-4 of these before I knew I was too drunk to lift a glass. Great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Thanks again Andy."
"Notes: This one really surprised me. I'm generally not a big fan of Lagunitas, but they do have their occasional winners, and this is definitely one of them."
"Very drinkable brew a great Imp. IPA would seek out again if I could get it. I'm going to go enjoy the rest now"
"A nice double IPA."
"Zum wohl!"
"Being biased on hoppy beers (pretty much the Pliny series or nothing for me), I really enjoyed this beer. Pliny fans should give this other Nor Cal hoppy ale a try."
"Smooth on the palate with a medium body and good carbonation. No alcohol in the taste. Long, dry, bitter finish. One of the more drinkable double IPAs I've had."
"A treat to find and enjoy on tap at one of Brooklyn, N.Y.'s standout beer spots THE GATE. Plain and simple, this is a fine example of that beloved brew style known as """West coast hop bomb DIPA""" Sparkling amber, typical head leaving the expected nice lacing. Grapefruit and more grapefruit in the nose, sustained citric and resiny hop crunch from first sip to finish. Would love to be able to find this either botled or on tap on a regular basis around these parts. Hop heads rejoice...If you can get some, do it and enjoy"
"Having one of these is a great idea. Two? I'm not really tempted. Carbonation is pretty soft, body barely medium. I'd love to try this on tap, but otherwise I don't know that I'll seek it out very often."
"D: For hardcore hopheads very nice, non-fans may struggle with the massive hop palate."
"So you well balanced beer people beware! The nose has a pine resin and strong grapefruit mixed with a big floral aroma. The taste is much of what was in the nose. Big grapfruit/pine resin and soft pedals of flowers on the tongue. The bitterness is not really being controlled with malt but the pine resin oil is so heavy that it leaves a silky finish. I had this on tap at Trappeze pub in Athens for only three dollars! What a bargain!!"
"D:Very good. Incredibly smooth. Does not seem like a double at all. Which can be a good and bad thing. Sometimes I want that destructive hop taste. This one doesnt have it, yet is still great."
"On tap @ Poor Phil's in Oak Park. I do have to say this about Lagunitas IPAs/IIPAs/American Strong Ales, they have a theme. This beer strongly resembled Maximus/the Frank Zappa IPAs, but with more dryness at the end. It's a good fruity beer with lots olf sweetness at the entry, and bitter in the finish. No complexity, but if you're just looking for a big, big session ale, this is another Lagunitas beer that is good to reach for."
"Copper with a minimal white head. Smells grainy and sweet, with some tropical fruit. Nose is flowery hops and ripe fruity esters. Firm bitterness mid-palate; more cloying sweetness with some musty grain late. Finishes bitter with a lingering alcohol and grain flavor. All over the map and not particularly clean, but drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, pale and bisquit malt scent along with a slight Carapils aroma. The hops are lovely. They have a bold Northwest aroma that's citrousy and refreshing to the nose. The taste is great. It has a big, bitter hop bite at the start and it pretty much carries through to the end. The malt create some balance, but not enough IMO. It goes down easy and resinates on the tongue. It seems a bit thin in the finish. It hides the 8% abv. well. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker, but could use a bit more malts and body. It's just a little too thin for my taste."
"Pours a clear orange amber color that's slightly darker than a number of the best beers of this style. It has a HUGE stiff yellow tinted head that leaves a lot of lacing. I rate it a 4 on appearance only because it becomes next to lifeless in a hurry (S/B 4.25). The amount of tangerine grapefruit citrus aroma is amazing! Big and aggressive. The mouth feel is surprisingly on the lighter side of medium, an oily orange citrus character, that lingers nicely, combined with a sweet doughy note of malts (4.25). I'm a big fan of the bitter hop resin flavor. The sweetness seems to remind me more of fruity than of a malty sweetness. Close to a 5.0 IMO. Very drinkable with a chill, the blast of pure hoppiness at room temperature is not for the week of heart. The 8.2% ABV is well integrated. Brewed Once - Limited - : ( Don't miss out, Cheers!!"
"D- This beer has big hops flavor that is more bold than complex but it does have nice supporting flavors to the grapefruit qualities."
"D: Yesss! This is an excellent DIPA. Session worthy!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, semi-dry, and bitter."
"Clear with a deep gold, nearly orange colour and a thick, sticky head. Good retention with lots of clumpy lacing. Very piney nose, some fruity grapefruit hop notes. Intensely fragrant. Moderate bitterness with lots of sweet malt adding balance. Quite fruity as well, with plenty of grapefruit. Mild pine resin hits towards the end, followed by lingering bitterness. Medium bodied and off-dry, with moderate carbonation. Decent texture overall. I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
"This beer is definitely one to try. I enjoyed it and would definitely have it again."
"If you are on the West Coast, GET THIS BEER. East Coast, trade for this beer!!!!"
"Cmon its called Hop Stoopid! What more could I ask for. So I delightfully opened this one up last night. Poured a very nice hazy and murky golden amber color with a very nice two inch plus head of foamy lace and a decent amount of suspended particles. The head faded slowly leaving behind copious amounts of side glass lace. The smell was overloaded with floral citrus hops that just exploded with aromas of tangerine and orange with the slightest touch of pine thrown in. The flavor was so remarkably smooth and fresh; it was in a word wonderful. A full on floral hop assault that just did not let up. Great stickiness and dryness to the fell and a taste that was very bright and full of orange and pineapple flavors with the right amount of sugar thrown in for good measure. This was just great, a really nice hopheads IPA and a very smooth brew indeed. I almost found this one to be sessionable, but the ABV will steer you away from that, even though you could not pick up the slightest touch of it in there. Overall this was a really fine beer for sure. I enjoyed every last sip of this sticky resin filled taste. I would have to highly recommend this one to anyone out there that really loves the hops, this will not disappoint."
"Pours a sunsent gold with a full one finger white head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is damn good for such a small head. Smell is pretty enjoyable. Nice creamy citrus hop scent with with an earthy fresh topsoil as well. Good pine tingle that remains throughout. Taste is s full thick gritty hop flavors with some evergreen as well. A bit of caramel malt is noticable which gives a small amount of balance Big dry grassy flavors in the end. To sum this one up, it's an earthy hop bomb. Mouthfeel is lighter than most in this style, but I like it better this way. This is definitely an experience, let's hope they keep brewing this one."
"D: Enjoyable IPA for sure. Good balance with a broad range of flavors. Enjoyable."
"The thinner body makes this beer extremely drinkable, dangerously so. Great DIPA, one of my favorites and I hope Lagunitas makes this at least a rotational release. Bottoms up!"
"Medium bodied leaning to a lighter than normal mouthfeel,very smooth with juicy/mouthwatering bitterness. Very nice beer,exceptional smoothness. A very drinkable double ipa would consider getting a keg of this for the home draft system."
"D: Lagunitas has been hit and miss for me so far, and this one is definitely a hit. Not outstanding, but solid and very drinkable."
"really superb IPA, so hoppy and I wish I had bought more!"
"I had this on tap in Portland OR a few weeks ago and recall this as being similar, a good hop fix."
"Pours a clean orange-ish / yellow color with an off white head. Aromas of, well, all hops, citrusy and grapefruit. In the taste, tons of grapefruity hops, and a sweetness with those hops. A bitter hop mouthfeel and a dry hoppyness in the aftertaste. Its kind of like chewing on hops, so citrusy almost a minty burn. A fantastic beer."
"Sampled at the Hops in Humboldt 2007 beer festival in Fortuna, CA followed by a 22 oz bottle I had at home the next evening. Poured a very clear and attractive gold with a nice foamy white head and good lacing rings. Nose of hops,,,,piney ones, citrus ones, and floral ones. Very complex aroma. Mouthfeel is very rich and smooth with a medium to heavy body. Flavor is balanced with the malts and hops in good proportion even with all the hoppyness. Long dry bitter floral hop finish and the alcohol is hidden nicely . A really great DIPA. Lagunitas has done it again."
"Overall, I was satisfied with this beer. Great on tap, and one I will try again sometime."
"D: I could have 2 pints of this but no more."
"Kind of pale amber or even a deep gold. Head was thinnish and lacing mainly sparse. The aroma: Wow! Easily the best smelling beer of all time. Sue kept snatching it from me for a whiff, fresh pine tree's and a hint of orange peel. Perfection. Ultra piney and orangey hops assault the palate. A real hop bomb. Medium mouth feel, good drink abliity despite the over 8% strength. Nice beer and I enjoyed this at Piaci pub and Pizzeria in Fort Bragg Ca."
"D: The abv is lower than I expected for an ale with this many IBUs. In many ways it is well-balanced, as the bitterness is not so overwhelming that you can't finish a sip. An excellent creation from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability  This is an extremely sessionable beer that all hop-lovers can appreciate. And really, out of the bottle it tastes like it's on-tap."
"Is there such a thing as an entry level DIPA? If so, this is it. Slightly paler than most DIPAs, fairly clear with a nice firm off ivory head. Nose that isn't quite as bold as would be expected, mellow fruit essence. Mostly pineapple. Hop notes are somewhat subdued for style, no malty sweetness in the nose. High carbonation for a light mouthfeel with a solid hop presence and a solid balance of malty characteristics to round this out. Not one I would seek out, but a DIPA I would gladly drink. Average+ for the style."
"Fuller medium body that is a bit creamy. Nicely carbonated. Bitter, hoppy aftertaste with some dryness. This bomber is going down rather easily. Wish I had another one. This is the best DIPA from Lagunitas so far. If you can get, buy it, try it, love it. It is good. Beer is good. I am finished."
"Hop Stoopid is one of my favorite Lagunitas brews. It comes close to entering the upper echelon of California DIPAs, but falls short of the very best the state has to offer. No crime in that. I'm glad I had the chance to see what the hype is all about. Thank you Talisker."
"Had this on tap today at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia (couldn't find it anywhere in California when I lived there). I get a pint and am immediately impressed with the pungent hop aroma elevating from the glass. Pine resin, grapefruit, and some mango flavors dominate the palate with some sweet malt taking the back seat. I could have drank a lot of these had I been somewhere else than the (United States) Belgian beer mecca. Reminds me a lot of Midnight Sun Brewing Co.'s Fuckhead. Highly recommended"
"Recieved this as an extra in a trade with lou91 (Thankyou!). Served slightly chilled into a pint glass, from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a clean, pale, golden copper color that had great clarity. About a finger and a half of bright white, bubbly head formed, with a bit of a vigorous pour. Had decent retention and left plenty of clingy lace on the glass. Smell was very strong in the hops department, and heavy on the grapefruit and other citrus. Nice malty notes in the background with again more citrus. Had a rather strong nose to it. Taste was strong on the hops with yet again tons of grapefruit. Also present were lemon zest, grass, yeast, bread, layered nicely on a sweet malt backbone. Hops had a strong almost chemical like taste to them, but strangely wasn't in a bad way. This brew was actually pretty well balanced in my opinion. A good shot of alcohol and plenty of fizzy carbonation finished this beer rather dry. Seems to calm down after a few sips. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel that was crisp and clean and also refreshing. Drinkability was good but got better as the beer warmed up a bit."
"Pours an orange amber with a strong initial head and great lacing. The smell is sweet and spicy with apricot, melon, bitter grapefruit, and grains of paradise. The taste is quite bitter, with additional flavors of pepper, a lighter apricot taste than might be suggested by the aroma, and piney hops. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and this beer has a substantial body. Very nice double ipa from Lagunitas. I was happy to find this one in the Bay area."
"The beer was wonderful on the palate and a sip or to with a bite of food made it a great mate for dinner. I had to have another."
"Beautiful orange color. Fluffy white head on top. Good aroma of hops-fresh cut grass anyone? Big hop flavor. Not bitter so much as pure hop flavor that is balanced great against the malt. Very full and well balanced mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable and pleasantly so. Great effort from Lagunitas. Makes me go all stoopid-like I need some help!"
"Highly recommended."
"Golden honey color, small, but attractive soft white head. Smells of sweet leafy floral hops. Tastes of orange zest and citrus oils with most of the hops up front, and milder on the finish. The mouth feel hints at the malts I can't seem to taste in here. The drinkability is good and the alcohol presence is well integrated with the other flavors (at a cooler temp. at least) A classic """balanced in its lack of balance""" west coast DIPA. I really like it, and still marvel that I bought it in a 7-11, which is unheard of in my neck of the woods. I am visiting the Bay Area, and I am quite pleased with the ubiquity of Lagunitas in all the corner stores around here."
"D: Very robust but drinkable, very good for a 2IPA."
"D: Very drinkable due to the outstanding balance and medley of flavors. The problem is that the 8.2% gets you in the end. An outstanding DIPA."
"While the flavor of this brew does not quite live up to the aromatics emanating from this beer, this is certainly the most enjoyable brew I have ever had from Lagunitas (though I should warn you that it may take a particular breed, a hop head certainly, to enjoy the characteristics of this brew. I wonder how much of my enjoyment of this brew is situational? I'll definitely have to try this again, but it is really hitting the spot right now; this is the last beer after a night of drinking malt focused brews. While my head may certainly be feeling the effects of the alcohol content, the aroma and flavor hide it amazingly well and make me think that I could quaff this brew pints at a time; a dangerous situation I might almost feel lucky enough to experience until the next morning. I am quite pleased; it is rare that the beer I end up with at the end of a night of a rating marathon (anything over three beers qualifies for me), is the best brew of the night. In fact I better score this beer now, as the longer I drink this and the more the alcohol effects me, the higher it score is going to rise. Actually on that note, this makes me think that I need to revist a lot of beers from my ratings past so that I can down-grade them."
"D: At 8% and the smack in the face with a pine tree, this is one area where this beer dips in score. Definitely worth a pick up every once and a while but I can't imagine picking up a 6er of this. Definitely better suited to a bomber style."
"Overall, an excellent beer, and I would happily drink it again. Given how well hidden the ABV is, I could even see drinking a few of these in one session."
"Notes: Once again Lagunitas produces a top notch brew and doesn't try and bust our bank. Well priced, excellent brew. Will seek out in the future."
"This is a wonderful release from Lagunitas Farmhouse. First had this one on tap at the Bistro DIPA festival in Hayward. In judging, this beer came in right behind Pliny the Elder. It comes in at 8.2 percent ABV and 100-plus IBU. This beer is made from 100% hop extract."
"Very citrusy and sappy. Big fluffly white head atop a tangerine body with moderate haze (not from the sediment). Very appealing hop bouquet with tons of citrus rind. The mouthfeel let me down with this beer, as it is a hair too thick and sticky and brings down the drinkability. Probably lots of hop products in this beer, like oils and such. Great for a hop bomb, but I really don't care for the heavy body at all. It doesn't show the alcohol very much, except for the heavieness of the malts. Recommended, but probably one I won't revisit soon. Cheers!"
"Pours a beautiful clear golden-yellow. Smells from 2 feet away like hops and deep malt. Taste and mouthfeel are a little light for a double IPA, but that could be because so many are so big. Definitely bigger than an IPA and leaves that hoppy resin aftertaste for a long time in your mouth that a good double IPA should. Easy to drink with lots of taste. Pick one up if you like hoppy west coast beers."
"Silkiness after the carbonation settles down. Still very drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"I was skeptical of the hop extract ingredients, but I really enjoy this beer. I loved it on tap at the Bistro DIPA Festival in Hayward, and was delighted that the bottle (reviewed here) lived up to that promise. Can't wait until it gets broader distribution - of DIPAs, this and Marin Brewing's White Knuckle will be staples in my fridge."
"Pours a clear amber, nice chunky white head forms, nice lacing all over, great retention, looks pretty good. Smell is hops up the wazoo, lots of pine and cedar, floral hops, some grains and caramel, overpowering hoppiness though, the way I like it. Taste is similar, enough malt to keep it drinkable, but pretty great piney resinous hops, super nice, bitterness is perfect, really coats the mouth. Mouthfeel is full bodied, quite thick, something I enjoyed about it, low carbonation, easy to drink for the ABV and bitterness, best Lagunitas I've had yet and would glady put down again. Thanks!"
"Another nice offering from an underrated brewer. A nice hop bomb dipa. This is worth a try, and is quite affordable."
"Sonoma Farmhouse label 22 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow , with a thick white color head - nose of spruce , hops , dry , cannabis , resin , and with a slight malt background  taste of mint , spruce , hops , grapefruit , caramel , and slight malts - body is creamy , and dry  aftertaste of resin , tar , and crisp"
"Drinkability- Damn near greatness. Not much wrong with this beer. I almost wrote it off before trying it. Tasty and very very thirst quenching. Flavors just dance together."
"A clear bright beer with a nice lingering head giving off great hop scents of grapefruit, kiwi and caramel. The taste is also very nice with a long dry hop bitterness and at 100 IBUs it is not overpowering. A nice offering and a great beer to pair with some spicy food. The Saison is next."
