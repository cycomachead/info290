"Love this one."

"Just a little too boozy for me, and a little too sweet."

"Not what I expected -- very bitter, and the smell and taste were more like alcohol than like hops."

"My #1 pick from Great Lakes and my Favorite IPA. A must try."

"This brew totally took me for a loop when I first tried it. It had a fantastic malt character that was almost reminiscent of a strong Belgian Ale. The hops were not overpowering in anyway and complimented the malts instead of dominating the brew. Great thick mouthfeel perfect for the warming imperial that it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I will definitely get more of this when I'm able to.  A solid double IPA and well worth the wait for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Didn't enjoy the hop profile. Tasted slinky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome, it is pretty dark and hoppy it is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"tart and crisp a little too heavy on the alcohol taste to be consider one of Great lakes best Imperials and for its price point one I will steer clear of unless its on tap somewhere"
""
""
""
""
""
"8/2..pours bright copper, lighter shade. Ring of white foam.  Resin pine nose, musty and damp. Taste is an overwhelming hop, potent bitter, puckering. Beneath is a boozy alchol burn. Oily hop residue stays behind. Packs a wallop for sure. 4 3.5 3.75 3.5 3.75"

"I have to be completely forthright, I feel I have to tell you I picked this up at a Wally World when food shopping for the week while was TDY to Wright Patterson AFB.  My selection was based solely on the 9.1%abv (needed a high octane offering)  and that it was an Imperial IPA (my go to fav)!!!  That being said, I count this among my best """random""" picks ever!  True to form, the IIPA does not disappoint! Anyone that's read my rambling posts knows I am a true Stone convert, and as such, believe """Enjoy By", is the standard  from which all other IIPA's must be judged! Therefore, I am obligated to say Great Lakes """Lake Erie Monster""" stands tall! The 9.1% is well hidden and hop bang is sublimed so that you're not wrecking your palate (take note Green Flash), leaving you with an enjoyable experience from start to finish! Do yourself a favor and give this a try!"

"O: A LOT less hops than I anticipated, I suspect it was because of the imperial nature, slightly more boozy and had some malt added to balance off the hops. Not what I was anticipating but highly desirable, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a 9.1abv% gives a generous glow of hops and alcohol warmth with some sweet toasted nature backing. A lingering, dry bittering and aggressive hop nature as well alcohol content gave me flashbacks from the first time i sampled a DFH 90 minute ipa. Very good and comparable."

"Disappointed by this one. I'd been hoping to get LEM for some time, and finally found it in Western Ohio. Within its """enjoy by""" date. The flavor is overwhelmingly alcoholic. There's not a big hoppiness, or much malt flavor, just alcohol, unbalanced. It's like a beer liquor. The 9+% gives a good buzz, but that's not why you buy a premium-priced brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great example of a DIPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried this again in 2014 and it is equally as good when I first reviewed. Excellent balance for a DIPA."
""
"O: Honestly, Lake Erie Monster was not at all what I was expecting, but goddamn if it isn't delicious... I'll be the first to admit that I'm a huge fan over stupidly bitter hop-assaults when it comes to DIPAs, and this is far from the aforementioned, but the flavors here are so complex and wonderfully executed that there's no possible way I can be disappointed by the huge malt presence and fruity profile. I don't know whose idea this recipe was, but someone give that individual a firm handshake. This beer is damn good."

"Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 9.1%. Lake Erie Monster pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is nice and pleasant with some citrus and grains. There is also some sweetness in the smell. The taste is bittersweet. The taste is different from most brews on the market. The bitterness is not over powering to this brew. At the end it is sweet with a some bitterness. You also pick up on the sweetness of citrus. The bitterness is nice in this brew because it is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth. This brew goes down nice for having a high ABV. Overall This brew is well balance and a smooth drinking brew. Overall I'm giving Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster a 4.5 out 5."

" Overall, a dynamite 4.25 is given to Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster from Great Lakes Brewing Co. I've admittedly been an IPA skeptic for a while now, thinking that it just wasn't my style. But this brew has changed my opinion of IPA's for the better. I urge you all to give this a try."

"This comes out a beautiful clear amber with a thick creamy white head. The head has moderate retention and leaves nice soapy lacing. The aroma is delicious, light hops reminiscent of tropical fruit. The taste is equally flavorful, again with the same tropical notes but this time coupled with a hint of citrus and a nice malt backbone. It has a thinner body but it matches up well with the flavor profile. This is truly an outstanding IPA."

"O-decent DIPA, but too sweet for it to be one that I go back to drink again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An exceptional DIPA with impressive depth and balance throughout. The aroma is powerful yet understated, a nice balancing act of stimulating allure and restraint. The malt grain and hop flavors blend well together without diffusing their individual pleasant characteristics, very resinous in nature with some hints of melon-like sweetness. The alcohol presence also mixes well with the bitterness and adds an additional degree of warmth and appeal. Big and bold and distinct enough to standout from the crowd of other excellent DIPAs."
""
""
"Solid Imperial but Chillwave is a much better interpretation of this style for me from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an interesting entry in the DIPA/IIPA pantheon. It offers a lot of solid, bright flavors over a strong malt backbone. Very good rendition that does not come off as a revelation, but as a work of solid craftsmanship."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very well made DIPA. It reminds me of Hercules by Great Divide. I think its the sweetness of the malts that do it. I wish that it was distributed in my area. I will definitely"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent beer. I suspect that Great Lakes has fermented this with a lager yeast (they use that for most of their beers, even the IPA) and this puts this beer outside the style guidelines for an Imperial IPA."
""
"Another great beer by Great Lakes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Verdict: I will likely swoop a 4-pack every year. Yet I doubt I'll buy more than that or brag about it~"
""
"An odd beer - not a bad one but not what I expect from a DIPA. Super fruity and sweet - a sugar bomb - and while I like a dollop of sweetness in a DIPA (see Southern Tier Unearthly), this takes things up a notch or two, making it almost an entirely different style.This is somewhat barleywine-like in texture, maltiness and sweetness. I'm sure I'll come back to this someday but I'd prefer this in a different season - like fall. Make this your final beer of the night and don't have more than one or you're in for a big headache in the morning."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a caramel-copper coloring with a thin, clingy, foamy, bright white head that leaves a great lacing as you go. Aromas of light pine, evergreen, citrus sweet and tart, cut grass, and subtle spicing. Solid, but not overpowering. Flavors are smooth and bold, with a solid dose of sweet caramel supporting a blend of tropical fruit and citrus sweet, with grassy and pine overlays. Very blended and balanced. Tangy sweetness with hints of bitterness fill the aftertaste, and the body is light and smooth throughout, with the carbonation providing a slight edge throughout. Damn tasty brew. The finish is smooth, slightly effervesced, and slightly dry, with a resinous linger. Solid, drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
"I'll be buying more of this right away."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Great Lakes products, and like many others have said, snag Alchem...ahem...Chillwave if you can. Or don't and grab some 'Fitz instead. :)"
"Overall my second favorite Great Lakes offering, only second to Chill Wave."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"definitely in my favorite IPAs list. this one deserves more love and recognition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't expect it to taste anything like a standard American DIPA. It reminds me much more of a strong Belgian pale with some tripel-like characteristics. Certainly a well made beer, and it may be more appealing to others, but I'm glad I bought a couple singles before snagging a whole case. If Chillwave is Jim Brown, and Rye Of The Tiger is Leroy Kelly, this Monster is more like Earnest Byner."
""
"This dipa pours a handsome amber hue with a small off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is an overly sweet blend of citrus, floral, and tropical fruit hops. There is also a generous amount of malt and alcohol present. The body is thick and sticky; almost too much so and I love sticky ipas. The flavor is overly sweet almost cloying. It is very fresh with an abundance of hops but the degree if sweetness interferes with how great of a beer this could be. This is a solid ipa but if you can pick up Chillwave instead."
"EDIT #2 5/20/14 I had to drop my scores on this beer. This year's version is different. The blast of overly ripe tropical fruit is here, but there's also a very pronounced grape presence, which is good, but there's a lot of strange bitterness hanging on to my palate. And there's more of a malt balance in this one. Though its still as drinkable as ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This has almost a lager taste and body to it. Not getting the expected hop pine and fruitiness. In a blind taste test I wouldn't peg this as a Pale Ale. This one does not fit well into any box. I know it is not my favorite (I love Chill Wave - I will stick with that)."
""
""
""
""
""
"A big disappointment, I was looking forward to trying this one a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I don't know if i like it more than chillwave or not. The bottle art sure is better on lake Erie. I do like that this one is more bitter than chillwave but at the same IBU's. Today i picked up three four packs, I always buy GLBC seasonals when they come around. Another great brew from Great Lakes!"
""
""
"O: This beer doesn't have much bitterness, but you can definitely perceive its strength from the strong dose of hops, which lends a caramel-like sweetness. The beer hides its alcohol very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has morphed into barleywine territory. I'm not throwing these away since I do like barleywines. Keeping my eye out again for fresh."

"Great super hoppy beer with a Belgium twist."
""
""
"EXCELLENT beer. One of the only 8+ percenters I'll actually order - even though there are quite a few I wouldn't turn down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: A really good DIPA and another great beer to add to the GLBC lineup. An intense and complex offering on both the nose and palette. A must try IMO. Seasonal Offering(May release). Classifed as an American Double/Imperial IPA @ 9% ABV. Consumed 6/20/2013."
""
""
""
""

"This is simply fantastic. Beautiful lacing clings to the tulip glass. Dark orange and clear, decent amount of carbonation. Smells of juicy fruits, floral bouquet, and bitter hoppyness. Mouthfeel is chewy and awesome. Taste is juicy fruit at first that falls into a nice malty and bitter back end that doesn't end too bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a clear golden color. There was about a finger of off-white head. Lots of lacing. The nose is good. Grapefruit, some pine, and malts. The taste is good. A bit of sweetness, and a fairly full body. Get a good bit of the caramel malts, as well as pine and citrus flavors. Pretty decent."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, a great IPA. A little heavier, due to the stout brewing, so it's definitely not a session beer. This is a good one, I highly recommend."

"O- this beer taste like a great session beer aside from the 9.1 ABV I could drink this all day long."
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite Imperial IPA of them all. I just tried Heady Topper and I think I still like LEM best. Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"
""
"I am so impressed with Great Lakes that I am trying any of their beers I can find in PA. Monster was enjoyed yesterday. Beautiful smooth double IPA with a taste good enough to go out and buy a case. This will be a definite beer to keep around. Good color, head, smell, and the taste was over the top."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. It's very potent, intense, strong. Good in small doses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent DIPA – worthy of a try."
""
""
"Overall, a very decent beer, which would appear to retain at least some hop bite past it's prime. Will be interesting to try this within a month of bottling, but if you are looking for a good balance with both hops and malts shining through, don't be afraid to grab a Lake Erie Monster close to it's best by date. You might be pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Pours a crystal clear honey color with a brief ivory head. Nose is subtle citrus dominated by sweet fruity esters including, dare I say, even a hint of strawberry. The taste is a superb balancing of a sweetish caramel malt against a drying pine hoppiness, which carries through to the finish. A nice smooth texture rounds out the package. Definitely one of the better Imperial IPA's I have tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, with freshness date clearly labeled. The ale has a hazy tangerine colored body with a huge, frothy, off-white head that holds excellent retention & leaves all kinds of lacing on the glass. Aromas are fresh with bread, caramel, tropical, mango, pineapple. On the palate there are notes of tropical, mango, papaya, loads of caramel, bready, toasted grain, plenty of malt cuts the seemingly not-so-bitter bitterness, tremendous balance here. Mouth-feel is super creamy, medium-full body, lower carbonation. I've had this one once before and wasn't crazy over it, but I stand corrected - this is an outstanding DIPA and a must try!"
""
""
""
"O: Slightly sweeter than I generally prefer my DIPA but still enjoyable. There is a pleasant amount of not too aggressive bitterness. Not quite the balance I prefer for my DIPAs - too sweet and not enough hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though it's about a week past the enjoy by date on this bad boi, it is still drinking fairly good. Kind of reminds Raul of his first real love; even when he knew things were past the expiration date, when it came down to gettin busy, it still wasn't that half bad. So, unlike said hoochie, even though this thang is expired, Raul wouldn't mind having seconds."
""
""
""
"O: Delicious! This is a big IPA that is not afraid to let the malt share the spotlight with the hops, maybe even star the show."
""
""
""
"Overall - a good offering from Great Lakes and I have had better Lake Erie monsters, maybe this bottle was a bit old. Great Lakes is my favorite brewery so they get some brownie points."
""
""
"Overall, quite good. The apple flavour is a bit strong for me, but good."
""
"overall: A great fruity DIPA, tastes a lot like a belgian IPA."
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA to drink for a long time."

"This tastes and drinks closer to a barleywine, to my tastes. It's so malt forward. It has enough hops and they, thankfully, are not excessive, but the malt carries the day on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Many may chastise me because I cannot smell well, but I would consider this on level with the few bottles of Pliny I've had, albeit slightly boozy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I loved this DIPA. It is hard for me to get excited about IPA's these days, but this is one holds its own. Again, surprisingly well balanced for how light it pours. My only gripe would be the booze poking out on the nose and palate."
""
""

"One of my favorite IPAs. It's a shame it's a seasonal"
""
""
""

"O - Been meaning to try this one for some time now. Its a good Great Lakes offering. Good flavor but not quite the perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice IPA but maybe not on the same level as some of Great Lakes other beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It's like a more accessible Permanent Funeral, with a simplicity that makes it super drinkable and accessible. I think Sun King Jungle Room is quite similar to this, but this expresses an even stronger tropic fruit character."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This was a surprising gem that blew my socks off. Between this and Alchemy Hour, Great Lakes makes two of the best DIPA's I have ever had and neither of them get the recognition I believe they deserve. If you like sweet big hop flavor beers then this is a must have. Fantastic stuff"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an outstanding beer that I would love to get again but it does not have any uniqueness that makes it stand out from other great beers. Just well done. Great drink-ability."
""
""
""
""
"Hazed orange-amber with some quality looking creaminess covering the surface. Aromas start out earthy, leafy, and a little """catty"""...it has a similar woody/earthy/herbal-ness I get from several hoppy Great Lakes beers. Joining in is some piney sweetness, slight alcoholic spice, and a touch of mint. Green, bitter pine resin and sweet malt taste. Citrus, fruit, grass, and a little bread. I don't know...this one isn't entirely doing it for me. Mellow by DIPA standards, but also just not my favorite blend of flavors. Bitter, creamy, and full bodied. I might give it another go next year. Right now I'm glad I got just the single bottle."

"O - Slightly above average IIPA that I am glad to have tried. Definitely a more soft IIPA compared to the big bold ones that are out there. Balance between bitter and sweet is okay, but the sweetness seems to come through more."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light amber/orange with a decent head of foam that fell fast to a thin ring and cap and left good lace. Champagne effervescence and great clarity. Nose is sweet, sweet pineapple. Sweet malt, cookie like, caramel and sticky. Some earth and fresh mango. Fresh cut grass. The alcohol shows up on the nose as ti warms. Taste is very pineapple and has a little oil to coat the tongue right away so you don’t think it’s too sweet. Hops are plentiful but somewhat tame except for a good helping of pine. The malt character is sweet, buttery, and creamy with some biscuit. There’s some alcohol to bite and warm a little on the way down. Really the most pineapple in a beer I have ever had. It drinks smooth and refreshing with a full malt profile that is very rich and lasts throughout the drink. It’s almost heavy and just a bit syrupy. The hops stay forward and offer a good bitter on the back palate to bring it to a close with nice dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured into snifter. Crystal-clear orange/gold, with a thick white head from a regular pour that fades quickly into a nice cap of foam that leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fruits, pineapple and mango, with a spicy hop twang behind it that slightly burns the nostrils on a deep inhale. Taste is big sweet clean malts, with tropical fruit hop flavors and a lovely bitter finish over the slightly sticky sweet aftertaste left from the malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, without being too sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent DIPA, not my favorite combination of flavours for sure. It does have the intensity of the malt backbone and bitterness, but I feel like its missing something and that would probably be the lack of intensity of the hop flavours that I come to expect from a double IPA. If they were to amp up the aroma hops, it would probably add a great deal more to this beer. (4)"

"Overall: a good and tasty DIPA but pales in comparison to Alchemy Hour. But Great Lakes never ends up disappointing me."
""
""
""
""

"O: great summer DIPA. i really enjoyed alchemy hour and this is almost as good. this beer is a little funkier than alchemy hour (in a good way). well balanced, less hoppy, crisp and sweet."

"Overall-not as good as alchemy hour, but not bad either. I would say this is a solid DIPA. GL has been making a lot of good brews for awhile now, but I think could be one they do without, especially if they make more alchemy hour. 4"

"Mind boggling. How am I drinking a IIPA where I'm hardly picking up any significant aromas or flavors? It's not like the glass or beer was nearly frozen, either. It looks good, it smells pretty nice, but the flavors really seem to be in hiding until the beer warms up quite a lot. It's far from bad, but if I wanted to drink a IIPA, I'd drink something that gives me more flavor.. I feel like after awhile, this would taste like drinking corn syrup. On the plus side, it IS insanely drinkable for the first 12oz at least, and the 9.1% isn't noticeable. Once the beer is sitting at room temperature for awhile, there's a SLIGHT throat warming on the finish, but that's it. I'd definitely drink this again, but I must admit, I'm underwhelmed."
""
""
"Taste is lighter than expected with the malts being super-light and the hops never really flexing bitterness or huge flavors. It is pretty easy to drink though and goes down smooth. The body is great with tiny-bubbled carbonation and a silky mouthfeel. Like a good DIPA, it gets better as it warms. Its good, glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal, this beer is very good! Very hoppy and true to the DIPA style. I'd highly recommend this beer to anyone who's a fan of DIPAs."

"M: Light and airy like fine whipped cream."

""
""
""
""
"o: What a great beer! And cheap as well. I paid under thirty for a case three months ahead of the best before. I'll definitely be buying more of this."
""
"The taste was more fruity than floral with big grapefruit and tangerines. A little mango and some grassiness, the tastes pull more towards the direction that I personally like. This tastes and feels light, refreshing and at 9 percent ABV, it can be quite deceiving."
""
"Fairly resiny brew, a touch sweet, and a bit hot. Another solid offering by Great Lakes. Nothing spectacular, but a good dipa."
"The alcohol is present in the finish, but is not off-putting in anyway. I found myself slugging this down rather quickly despite the high alcohol content. Another winner from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 - I have never had this beer before as Great Lakes does not distribute to CT and was looking forward to it; overall, it tastes to me like the quintessential """Third Coast""" IPA with malt>hop presence; I have heard and read that this beer has a """huge hop presence," but, compared to some West Coast hop bombs, I find this humorous; the malt presence, however, is distinct and very pleasant; if you're looking for a change from aggressively hopped and/or less bitter/more tropical tasting DIPAs, I would give this one a shot; however, I prefer the former so much that I'll unlikely be coming back to this one this year after this four-pack"
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid DIPA that I would seek out and drink more of. Well done, Great Lakes!"
"o: Decent GLBC offering but I much prefer the artist formerly known as Alchemy Hour. This one is a bit too sweet & syrupy. Love the label art though."
"Overall a very sweet and not overly bitter, reminds me of 90 minute. Hides its abv very well. I really like this but it is too sweet to have a lot."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 7/26/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, honey, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great hop complexity and moderate malt balance. Taste of big mango, pineapple, pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, floral, grass, honey, bread, and floral earthiness. Moderate pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tropical fruit, citrus, pine resin, floral, grass, honey, bread, and hop earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance that doesn’t overshadow the hops, and zero cloying flavors lingering after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Big hop flavor complexity with moderate malt balance; and dangerously smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"O - This beer is a good example of why to do tasting notes. As a result of this, I'm going to pair this with a breakfast of a citrus bowl, French toast, and grilled light sausages - for dinner. In general, I don't enjoy standard IPAs because I find them unbalanced. This beer, and other Imperial IPAs I've tried, however, seem to be brewed with a much richer malt bill (and higher OG) that stands up to the IBUs, so not only is the sum of the parts bigger and fuller, it's also much better balanced. Another great creation from one of best breweries in the region."

"Overall, a solid IIPA. This and Burning River remind me a lot of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Torpedo in tandem. Only difference is that this is a little more sharp with the hops than Torpedo. In the end, a very good IIPA."
"Overall: Excellent beer. I don't usually go for the IPAs, but this one is quite good. I would absolutely buy a four-pack again and would be interested in trying it from the tap."
""

"Overall I'd put this in world class level. It's extraordinary. My favorite offering from Great Lakes yet, and that brewery just continues to impress me."

" The taste is impressive yet very herbal with mild citrus and slight grapefruit flavor with a mild caramel in the malt with a mango and apricot type flavor with slight alcohol in the taste as it warms gradually with low grassiness and mild spice notes with a sweetness that also increases a little too noticeable actually for me without any alcohol warming in the finish which is alos good. I enjoy this - definitely a good amount of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness to satisfy, however could use more flavor from hops and less bitterness...also the feel lacks a dry and drinkable quality which means I really only want 1 at any time."

"I am updating my review in September 2012. I had a bottle over the weekend that was just too damn good not to up my score. The nose was off the charts pineapple and just so aromatic with citrus. The flavor followed up with the same. This is still a sweet beer, but I got way more citrus and pineapple in this bottle. Note: Bottle was from the 2012 batch, so it was probably 2 or 3 months old, but still I really enjoyed it. Solid DIPA."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the great blend to the flavoring. The nose was nicely hoppy and sweet, but sugary enough to resemble a fruit rollup. This is also why we weren't so surprised at the sweetness of flavoring. Otherwise, there was a great and equally as sweet malty base to stand up to the fusel booze and bright bittering citric hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber color with a modest white head that recedes in short order. The aroma oozes with the essence of crisp, clean, citric hops. The flavor matches the aroma perfectly. The hop bitterness here is monstrous indeed. Try as I might to tease out some of the other flavors that I presume exist, I just can't get past the astringency of the hops. I should probably note that I'm not a fan of IPA's, so one as fierce as this is facing an uphill battle to win my affection. This is certainly representative of the style, but it's just not for me."
"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed past the enjoy by date of 7/25/12, take that you IPAniacs. It's 9.1% and an Imperial so I'm sure it gets a lil warmer w/age. Pours a wonderful honey gold into tulip glass w/a good fingers worth of head. Smells of citrusy hops like grapefruit and hints of sweet malts. Taste and mouthfeel; Wow, very nice, better than expected full, crisp, and grapefruit like right up front. Great balance between the abv heaviness that warms, the sweetness from the malts and the aforementioned grapefruit from the citrusy hops makes this a great sipper from a solid brewer"
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very tasty, sweeter, and rather drinkable Imperial IPA. Quite nice."
""
"O - A beer that I look forward to every summer. Definitely a top notch product from GLBC."
""
""
"O- A decent beer, but I don't know that it really screams IIPA or even super hoppy beer to me. Seems more like a middle of the road IPA to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent beer noting too special, but not one to turn down either, the 9.1% ABV was not noticeable either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very good for an imperial IPA- medium body with light quasi-prickly carbonation. I love it!"

""
""

""

"O: GLBC makes some of my favorite beers, and this one is no exception. This is a top-tier IPA, for sure. The taste is surprisingly complex. Most DIPAs just assault the palate with hops, but there's more depth here."
"Overall: Good, but too much fruit juice for me."
"Pours an orange slightly hazy/cloudy colour with good carbonation. Tastes of citrus, with tropical fruits in there to go with the good hoppy bitterness. Considering the high 9.1%, this drinks down very smooth and its well masked. This brewery pumps out some good, quality beers."
"Very citrusy for a double IPA, without a lot of the spicy hop flavors or heavy malt notes, or accompanying pine often found in this style. I like that as a change of pace- tastes a bit like Sweetwater IPA if that were revved up to 9.1%- lots of grapefruit with a touch of orange, sweet clean malts, and a resinous finish that still comes off as fairly clean, and a short bitterness at the finish. Very nice."
""
"O: The thick cloudiness with little particles and the pineapple aroma really stood out to me about this beer. But the head was disappointing compared to the Dogfish Head, and the flavor was a bit too fruity for my taste. The mouthfeel also wasn't as smooth as the Dogfish Head. Overall, interesting flavor, but the 90 Minute IPA was the real winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Really enjoyed this, can't believe I hadn't tried it earlier. This ranks right up there with some of my favorites in the style. We all know some beers get pretty hyped, I would argue this one deserves a little more. Glad to recommend."
""
"Overall- The smell is great, I almost don't want to drink it. It tastes very good as well but is a little bit one note. It's a very good not but that is what separates awesome from spectacular."
"Over all one of my favorite double/imperial ipa's in the world. As well as one of my favorite beers period."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: In the ball park but close to the foul line :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very well balanced double ipa. A bit unique too, had a tad more spice to it than many others that I have had. Defintely have it again"
"Mouthfeel: This is one of the tastiest IIPAs I have ever drank. It is easy drinking but still dominates the palate like a IIAP should. This is a first class beer by a first class brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been a Great Lakes beer fan for some time, but it wasn't until this summer that I got the chance to taste this wonderful seasonal creation. I consider myself a hops man, and this beer is perfectly crisp and sharp, yet balanced in sweetness. Truly my favorite from a wonderful brewery"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very flavorful DIPA but one that bordered on Ameri0can Strong Ale for me. The 9.1% ABV is quite noticeable, as the brew seems to pride itself on hop assertion more than malt balance, which is fine, but it made the malts cloy a bit when it seemed harmony of flavors shouldn't have suffered at all. I'd have it again as a standalone brew to get the full scope of things next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, even if it's not the best in style. Would pick up a four-pack again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Unlike any other DIPA I have had. Lots of malt-forward caramel and grain characteristics and an earthy bitter hop profile. It's well balanced and not overly bitter, in fact it's mostly sweet. But I expect a stronger hop profile from a DIPA and this lacks the punch that hopheads rejoice for. A well-made beer, but not really to style and ultimately not that memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, while this is nowhere near the most remarkable DIPA i've had, it's hands-down the most accessible. It's more of a 1.5 IPA, and to me at least that's absolutely fine."
"O. Chiefly pine hopped imperial ipa, well balance just not super complex or interesting."
""
""
""
"O - I struggled with the first few sips, but it grew on me. I'd have to say I liked it enough and it's pretty good but it's just not in the same league as the big players like Pliny or Abrasive. I'd really like to see how this is when fresh, like within a week or two from bottling."
"Poured a nice hazy orange into a Hoppin Frog pint glass. Nice hop aroma with some grapefruit and piney notes. Taste is very smooth and really enjoyable. I had low expectations with this beer and I am totally impressed with how smooth this beer is. Mouthfeel is moderate and just a really tasty DIPA. I think this beer is way underrated and would definitely recommend. Great job Great Lakes."
""
""
""
"O - A really good IIPA honestly, that is undone to an extent by the high alcohol and lack of nose. This beer could be backed off to around 8% or so and would likely benefit (but then it might not be a MONSTER afterall I suppose). A stronger hop profile on the nose would help greatly too. Would love to find it on tap and see how it rates that way. Above average."
""
""
"O - Better than I expected from the smell. The orange and stone fruit flavors and balancing bitterness make up for it. I like it."
"O-It's a very bitter ipa. Almost too bitter. The tastes aren't too great really. Theres not too much to this making me enjoy it. A good ipa when selections are very limited but they'd have to be extremely limited for me to prefer this"
"Overall, this is what you would expect from an imperial, but taken in an unexpectedly sweet direction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. this is a very underrated IPA i would put this up against a Doubletrouble or a 90 Min. Has more of a sweet hop taste compaired to a pine tasting IPA. the 9.l ADV is very well masked. this one will sneak up on you on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent all around, but nothing really stands out apart from the aroma."
""
""
"The beer pours a medium amber with an inch of white head that holds to the glass nicely. There is no sediment and the head's half-life is about 30 seconds without swirling. The nose of this beer is a bit of a monster with biting alcohol and pungent citrusy hops. This definitely pushes the DIPA limits with its abv, but could have used more aromatic hops. The taste is mellow with a hearty malt sweetness and complementary hoppiness. This translates to a well balanced, drinkable DIPA, but the alcohol unfortunately puts it over the edge. I can't sit here and relax with a couple 9% IPAs...I can essentially have 1 beer before call it a night if I'm expected to drive anywhere. Therefore, I think this beer could be toned down a bit...while still being big brother to commodore perry."
"Overall (4.5): I love this beer. If you’ve read this far into the review, it may not come as a surprise at this point but I think this is a seriously underrated DIPA from a very good brewery. Erie Monster is a seasonal release that I look forward to every year. I understand if it’s not a “top-tier” DIPA for most people—it is on the sweet side for West Coast fetishists and almost nothing could pack the aroma or blinding bitterness of something like Heady—but what I love about this beer is that I can’t think of anything else exactly like it. So, great job, Great Lakes! This is my favorite beer from this brewery, without a doubt."
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. It rivals all the top DIPAs to me, but the price is a little high which would keep me from buying very much of it. Maybe 1 a year each time it came out would be good for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes heavenly - a perfect balance of hops and malt - and the aftertaste is even better. The better beer vendors in the area ordered tons of this but it will go quickly. I'm going to go out and get a mess of it tomorrow."
""
""
"This is a big, hoppy dipa, but it is very balanced. Almost too much for me to fall in love. A good dipa."
"O: Very good, enjoyable and something I would definitely drink again"
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice light amber color body with not a lot of head to it. I can almost taste the beer just by smelling it, the smell consists of pine,and citurs hops. The taste is upfront of bitter hops, then the taste of some fruit comes on the back of the tongue, almost a cross between a mango/pineapple taste. The mouth feel is really good, rolls off the tongue really nice and overall a damm good DIPA,"
"O - Unexpected (almost.. 'tangy') bitterness aside, this is quite the good effort by great lakes. Haven't ever been disappointed by them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the best DIPAs I've had. Excellent work Great Lakes. This one goes down very easy for a DIPA. I may move to Cleveland just for this."
""
""
"I had this after a Double Jack, and it is a lesser beer, but solid. It is more balanced between sweet and bitter. A very nice II IPA."
""
"O - Resiny hop character with a lot of alpha bitterness. Balance is just ok."
""
" Full-bodied and flavorful, with a viscous mouthfeel from the hops. Alcohol is well hidden. This beer is quite easy to consume, and although the nose isn't as balanced as the taste, it's quite tasty. Another rock-solid effort from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Dipa. Pours dark golden with decent sized white fluffy head. Smells very floral with some citrus notes and a good bit of sweetness. Nice bite up front, plenty of aromatic citrus, sweet bready finish. Medium/lightish mouthfeel given the style and ABV with medium to high carbonation. Excellent as usual from Great Lakes."
""
""
"Where does Lake Erie Monster fall among the Top 50 of the style? Is it even up there? Because, it should be. Tremendous brew. One that I enjoy year-after-year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Orange, pale liquid showing lots of bubbles, with a tight white head that stays with the beer. Moderate lacing. The nose is citrus, slightly resinous. American hops flavor dominates up front, with some maltiness in the middle, showing a bit of honey but no graininess. The finish is dry and bitter. The alcohol reveals itself mostly in the finish too, with a bit of heat. Feels big and slick. Somewhat better balanced than many beers in this style, still very much about the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I always look forward to have my first Lake Erie Monster of the year, I am not a big IPA fan but this beer here is not so over powering with Hops that I can't taste the other flavors. If your looking for a beer to get you were you need to be this is a great beer to start with."
""
""
"A very strong offering from Great Lakes. Glad I had it fresh on tap. Not sure it would hold up well and since there are lots of great DIPA's out there... prob would not by off the shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a pretty dang good IPA that holds a candle to the best in the great lakes states. I would not say this is quite as good as hopslam but it has the exact same hop flavor in my opinion. Makes sense being that they are only about 200 or so miles apart. Not as good as hopslam but MUCH cheaper and should be a solid contender for your IPA fix."
""
"O: Amazingly refreshing for a DIPA. But its high drinkabiliity can be brutal as the weather warms up in the summer months. Possibly the best overall DIPA east of the Rockies. Great Lakes has done it again. Amazing consistency with their seasonal brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Being an Ohio guy, I really want to like this beer but it just falls short for me on the DIPA scale. It is a good beer, but this is a crowded field and there are many better options."

"The smell is very balanced with a good malt backbone, yet theres still some citric (grapefruit and orange and lemon) in there as well. I love the taste. Theres a thick powdery malt backbone thats different from the rest of the GLBC lineup, but it works here so well. There is a nice bittering hop presence, but the citric hops presence (juicy orange, lemon zest, and grapefruit) feel oily and slick. Its a bit different than other DIPAs, its more slick and drinkable."
""
""

"This is complex, yet not intimidating. In fact, you really discover, if you have not by now, how delicate is the brewing process; there is a fine balance of sweetness and substance. No, this is no session quaff; it is one to savor and respect. Great Lakes Brewing is an excellent brewery that tempts one to hop a plane to Cleveland. If you cannot make the trip, at least make the effort to seek out the Monster."

"Overall: The 3 of us that drank this drain poured it. Not sure if it was off cause it had expired 2 months ago or not but with that being said the beer should not have turned this bad in those 2 months. Avoid this beer especially if MikeytotheB sends you one."
"Certainly a very good beer, but as a DIPA, not a huge wow factor. Recommended nevertheless."
"O - Great beer, one of my favorites of this style & probably my favorite from Great Lakes Brewing."
"If I had known about Great Lakes bottle dating I wouldn't have picked this up. Hope to find a fresher bottle in my future travels."
"Great Lakes could be the best thing that ever happened to Cleveland. The brewery continues to impress....which is more than can be said about the Browns. The beer poured a clear golden/orange color with a large frothy white head. Nice retention, a little lace. The smell included citrus, orange peel, fairly floral, and malt. The taste had citrus up front again, pineapple & grapefruit; turning quite floral with a candied hops presence. In addition, caramelized malt. Has a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel was good....full body, medium low carbonation with slight alcohol on the finish. Overall a nice imperial IPA, with a very strong floral presence in the taste. I will drink this again."
"If you like abrasive IIPAs, and I do, this is a keeper."
"Another solid beer from Great Lakes. worth a try."
"O/D- The first high abv true craft beer I ever tried a year and a half ago, this is one of those that brought me to love this style. Nowadays I could use a bit more hop bitterness. The only thing that takes away from it's drinkability is the booziness, which, hey wait, adds to it's overall likeability. Glad to finally get to review my gateway brew."
"Great Lakes delivers another good one. I love the loads of citrus. The alcohol is a bit too present in a brew with this ABV and limits drinkability, but otherwise very good."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice strong hop profile and there was just enough malt flavor and other flavors to prevent it from becoming a hop bomb."
"Overall: It has a nice aroma that is complex and pleasant, but not the most dynamic flavor. Still good, but not a top tier DIPA."
"Overall a solid Imperial IPA"
"Overall - This is a very good smallcraft IPA"
"O/D - Un-complex for a DIPA. A good hop dose, but the malt bill isn't strong enough and the hops could work better with something a little heavier. Still a good beer, just better examples of the style out there."
"O: Decent drinkability, doesn't taste like its just over 9%. This is definitely a sweeter DIPA. Not my favorite. Not worth it in my opinion."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"Pours a really good cottony head but the body is a lighter orange rather than dark amber or even banana yellow. Smell is biscuity sweet caramel malts and touch of tropical fruits. Should probably note that best by date is next week. I guess it at about 3 months. What it does have in the smell it has a lot of. Much more hoppy than I expected. Bitterness especially hits in the end. Biscuity and caramel malts dominate with that tropical zing in the end and a healthy dose of bitterness, especially at 3 months old. I don't recall caring for this last year but it seems pretty stellar right now."
"O-It's a decent beer, worth a try of course. It's maybe the most affordable dipa that I've ever seen. I got this as a single for less than 2 dollars. Pretty sweet."
"O= This is a winner for sure but then again what DIPA isn't. Looking at this critically however I would say this is good but maybe a bit old or maybe just not where it needs to be for a DIPA. Worth checking out however. If your in MN I would option for something else next time however."
"Lake Erie MOnster pours pretty hazy, and it's straight orange. There's a billowing pile of cream colored foam sitting atop the beer, it comes up to four fingers in height. Head retention is solid, and there's lacing left behind in sheets. beautiful beer. Gorgeous looking beer. The nose has a certain aroma that I can only describe as grainy, it reminds me of the smell of a bag of crushed grains I get for homebrewing. There's aso some citrusy orange present, but the grainy sweetness is what dominates the aroma. That balance gets turned on its head in the flavor department. Orange marmalade is the primary flavor, though that same grainy note is also present. Bitterness packs a solid punch mid palate. The body is nice and light, fairly agile. The carbonation though is a bit lackluster, the beer feels like it dies mid palate. In fairness to Lake Erie Monster, it's probably got a little bit of age on it. Still, it's within the brewery's best by date, and right now it doesn't measure up to the better double IPAs out there. I'd be interested to try it again a little more fresh though."
"O: not what I expected. After hearing so many good reviews, I had to try it. It was advertized as a “hop-head” beer and idk if this was an off batch but there wasn’t a crazy amount of hops in this one."
"O--This was on OK attempt at the style, but I personally do not like it. As I have said many times, I prefer the super bitter DIPAs. Never been a fan of any sweet ones."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer- Great lakes has a winner here, although with the high alcohol content, I doubt that I would want to have more than one in a session."
"O - why I'm not big on dbl/imperial IPA styles like I am imperial stouts, there are a few I drink on occasion. This is one of them. It's smell and appearance are stunning and it's taste is unique. GReat Lakes is a quality outfit, and this brew shows the range they have is unlimited to what they brew. This brew surprised me as I wasn't expecting to like it. I'll buy again I'm sure at least once every time it's released."
"Hazy orange with a small head. Smell was a lot of caramel and some fruitiness, which carried through to the taste--really sweet, fruity apricots and pear, tropical fruits, but all of the action is on the front of the tongue. None of the stinging hop bitterness I would have expected from a DIPA--I was actually surprised to come home and find that it was classified as one, as I drank it blind on tap. It's still a very tasty beer, but not a stand-out? I would try again on bottle to see if it's different there."
"Overall- A nice imperial IPA, with a very strong floral presence in the taste. I will drink this again."
"Overall - This is a pretty solid DIPA, and one that I can definitely recommend, but not necessarily a big standout, i/e nothing really special to remember hear. A very good DIPA, just not a great/memorable one, but a good representative of the style."
"Most DIPA's have big alcohol as is the case here so that limits me to maybe two pints what with me not being a big hangover fan and all."
"Overall Im glad to have tried it and I would recommend it as a single purchase."
"Overall very enjoyable might to be world class but pretty tasty. Want to thank merlin48 for this sample."
"I'm not big on """reviewing to style""" but this not only doesn't taste like a IIPA, it's not all that good. Mediocre."
"Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, with a sweet aftertaste. The alcohol is not well disguised unfortunately, and makes the beer less enjoyable. Not a bad beer by any means, but several notches below the best DIPAs on the market."
"O: Very good. As it turns out, I didn't need the bag of Doritos, but I ate a bunch anyway. I wish I had waited to eat the BLT sub with this beer; that would have been nice. But, you live and you learn. Cheers from Hasbrouck Heights, NJ."
"Poured a fairly clear pale golden color with lots of head, and great lacing. The smell was very citrus forward, with some hops and pine. Taste was almost like there are tangerines or mandarin oranges in there. A different citrus twang them I'm used to. Hoppy, but not really huge in bitterness. Nice mix, and nice job hiding the huge ABV. Very tasty, but less bitter than DIPA's I've had previously. Enjoyable, but not super. Mouthfeel was good, nice and rich."
"Overall, this is a fairly good DIPA, which could use a bit of fine-tuning to perfect. I like the mix of tropical fruit flavors and can appreciate a sipper from time to time, but still think the ethanol is too noticeable in taste."
"O: A nice, semi-sweet, tropical hop forward DIPA"
"O - This wasn't as good as I hoped. It is still a tasty Imperial IPA but didn't live up to my expectations."
"Again not a bad DIPA. Didn't blow me away but better than average for sure. Would definitely try again."
"Good in theory, poor execusion. I'm glad to have tried it, but would recommend you look elsewhere for your DIPA fix. A rare miss from Great Lakes."
"Nice malty undertones as well trying to balance it out."
"O - A very nice DIPA that provided a good break for the """ordinary""" for me."
"Overall - Probably the best Great Lakes beer I've had so far. The taste was very well balanced and the alcohol was well hidden. It reminded me a little bit of the 'Smuttynose Big A' DIPA, but slightly better. The aftertaste was really enjoyable.. the sweetness mixed with the lingering hop bitterness makes this a beer I will buy again and again."
"O-I like DIPA's like this enough but prefer just a bit more hop bite....not a lot more..just a little...still quite enjoyable and like I said maybe the age of this took a little off its edge..."
"O - Sweet. Where are the hops?"
"This was a little too sweet for me. Not one of my favorite DIPAs, but I didn't have trouble drinking it."
"O: Normally, I wouldn't give a beer that scores a 3.0 in taste a 4.0 overall, but Lake Erie Monster has some really nice parts; especially the appearance. Also, if not for the alcohol being present, this would be a 3.5 in the taste department. At any rate, this is a beer that I'd gladly drink again, but doubt that I'd buy."
"Pours a nice bright gold with a hint of orange. Medium white head. Some lacing on the surface. Great citrus hop smell. Lemons with sweetness from the malt in the nose. Taste is very good with up front bitterness. Big sweet light malt in the background. Huge hop flavor. Chewy resiny hops. Great pleasant lingering bitterness. Warming. Full bodied. Overall I think this is a very solid IIPA. Very drinkable for the style too."
"Overall not bad, very malty and lacking a bit on the hops, but they are there."
"Overall a very nice refreshing ADI IPA, surprising the 9% ABV was well masked, another nice beer from Great Lakes."
"I love this beer. This is my second year of enjoying it. It is easily in my top 5 Ohio beers and I look forward to it each release."
"-some stinging carbonation, but overall, it's pretty smooth and froathy."
"Another solid brew from Great Lakes, which is definitely worth a try."
"Cheers"
"Pours and orangish-red with very thin head. Nose is more malts than hops; malty, piney. Taste is a little less than I hoped for, more malty than most DIPAs. I was hoping for hops instead they are mellow and in the back. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected as well. Not bad, just not what I was anticipating."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. Really cut the heat for me tonight. Again best DEIPA? What. Dry hop this in a cask then call me."
"Poured a hazy orange with a finger thick off-white head. Smell was a sweet citrus. I was truly surprised at the flavor. Way sweeter than any other DIPA I've had, the hops didn't play a huge role (comparatively). For me, that was actually a plus. Mouthfeel was maybe a bit too sweet, it left a bit of a cloying sensation in my mouth. Could have been crisper. Overall, very good beer, with cool label art."
"Pours a quite cloudy golden amber color with high carbonation and big poofy white head, some sticky lacing. Scent is dominated by notes of orange with light amounts of grapefruit and pine, backbone is noticeably sweet with some hay and wheat like notes to it. First sip dominated by bitter orange with rind, backbone is toasted grain, notes of a wheaty twang present itself in the malt, quite sweet. Floral, grapefruit, pineapple and pine all come through as the tongue adjusts. Very interesting fruity and fresh grain notes to this dIPA. Medium bodied, smooth but maybe a touch too much carbonation. A somewhat unique approach to the dIPA, pretty good."
"Pours out a copper colored body with a foamy white head that has good carbonation and some of the best retention and lacing I have ever seen on a beer. This beer is a beer that looks good in a photo. The nose consists of some hops and a hint of sweet malts. Sort of an apple land caramel like smell. The taste is a nice balance of orange, pine and floral hops along with a caramel and apple sweetness. The mouthfeel is a nice smooth and creamy feel that makes the beer enjoyable to drink. It does finish off very dry and makes you thirsty for more beer, but when a beer taste this good you don't mind going back for seconds."
"Sampled from a bottle best by August 4, 2011. Golden orange- yellow with a viscous appearance as the unfiltered floaties appear frozen in suspension after the pour. Starts with a short, snow white foamy head that slowly reduces to a light wispy cap. Nice sticky lacings on the glass. Citrus orange and lemon hop aromas up front, a bit earthy, with a very sweet maltiness beneath the hops. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Finishes clean and semi-dry. Relatively balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness for a DIPA. Citrus and pine hops and very sweet maltiness from the beginning to near the end when the sweetness tapers, the pine hop starts to dominate and a bit of alcoholic heat shines through."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into my large snifter...greeted by a pleasent clear burnt orange color, thinish head with slight lacing..nose is malt and slightly piney and fruity hops...not bad..taste is an upfront malty sweetness, not overwhelming but ever present that is quickly followed by a decent mix of hops, piney,fruity and a slight bitter finish, the mouthfeel is nice, a tad surupy finish but pleasent..not the best DIPA but definately drinkable..."
"O: A really good but not quite top tier DIPA because of the huge blast of caramel sweetness. If this were dampened and simplified to include a bigger proportion of pale malt and lesser crystal malts this would come off less like a fruity caramel bomb and more like a more balanced DIPA with big malt and hops flavor and aroma."
"A nice little treat that fell into my lap recently and I’m rather enjoying this one. A little heavier in the malt and sweetness than I usually like my DIPAs but very good none-the-less."
"Overall I thought this was a good DIPA, but it just can't hang with the heavy hitters like Hopslam and Double Trouble, but it's a good DIPA in it's own right. I really liked how this beer had a pretty heavy pineapple presence, most DIPA's tend to focus on the grapefruit and mango and let the pineapple take the backseat, but on this one the pineapple took the wheel nicely and let other fruits ride in the back. The flavor and drinkability is what I liked the most about this beer, the lighter body and the well hidden alcohol makes this beer pretty drinkable and it goes down faster then you would expect, especially on a hot summer day. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of balance when it came to incorporating the malts, the only thing that really came through was the sweetness and that was a little too much for my liking. I will probably buy a four pack when it is released next year and I would recommend this to most hop heads, the heavy pineapple presence makes it stick out from a lot of other DIPA's. This was another good and solid brew by Great Lakes, so far they are my favorite Ohio based brewery, I haven't had a beer from them that wasn't solid for it's style."
"D - Another great brew from Great Lakes. Picking up the 4 pack of this on a whim was one of the best beer-related decisions I've made in a long time. Reco!"
"Overall a pretty damn good beer. I really enjoyed it. Could be a little hoppier for a double IPA but still good. I would definitely buy again."
"O - Not a bad beer, I don't mind drinking it, although it's not one of my favorites. Could be content drinking it, particularly with a meal."
"O: Great Lakes fails to make a bad beer, this is a great IIPA. Gives you a good mix of hop profiles with a high ABV and doesn't overpower you with malt."
"Overall a great DIPA, especially if you like a frontal accent of pineapple hop flavor and a slightly more savory malt bill than usual which makes the sweetness come more from the hops than from the grains....just barely."
"Cheers!"
"O - Not too bad. Pretty crisp and light. Not too over the top with flavors and smells but at least its not in a bad way. This is a nice seasonal to drink but wouldn't be my first choice in a DIPA. Worth a try though for people who like DIPAs."
"Overall, a solid ADIPA with a good balance. Been looking to try this one for a long time and glad that my buddy ummagum shipped me a couple - many thanks! Highly recommend. Not avail here - got from ummagum. Rotation - if avail near me this would make the regular rotation. [R;Y]"
"D: Very drinkable for the style, I could put down a few of these right now, but just have this one. Dammit!"
"This is a very well brewed beer. It's a touch different than other DIPAs. While this has a great look, nose, and mouthfeel, the bitter aftertaste is a bit mouch. I prefer my DIPA's a bit more hoppy in the nose with less bitterness."
"O- thumbs up. Highly recommend"
"The CPJ"
"The Lake Erie Monster showed up in MN this year so I picked up a 4 pack. Its best aspect was the aroma, oranges and the usual pink grapefruit. Not too bitter, a solid DIPA."
"O - A resounding showing from Great Lakes, who in my opinion seem to deal much less with bigger IPAs. I look forward to this Monster and all the destruction it brings every summer."
"Mouthfeel/Finish: One of the better Imperial IPAs on the market.  I like the malt backbone and bold hop aromas.  Easily drinkable and well balanced.  It comes in a four pack and is a bit pricy.  But if you are a hop head, this is one that you should go out of your way to try.  Easily in my top five when it comes to IIPAs."
"O: Just a solid beer overall from Great Lakes. Can they make a bad beer? If they do, I haven't had it!"
"Overall: A pretty solid version of a DIPA. Pretty bitter but sweet and tasty."
"Perfectly clear pale orange color with a finger worth of head that left some spotty lacing on the glass. Big time hoppy aroma, loads of citrus, orange, and a ton of herbal qualities. This thing definitely smells like a hop monster. Yep, it sure is. Hops completely dominate this beer, tons of pine needles, citrus, grapefruit, with only a hint of pale malt flavor on the semi-sweet, sticky, resinous, oily finish. This is a bit too much for me. I probably would have liked this brew a whole lot more in my early years of craft brew enjoyment, but find myself shying away from over the top beer these days. There's just no balance whatsoever, all insane piney/grassy/herbal hops with a splash of citrus/orange to boot. Mouthfeel is medium, again, oily and slick. If you love a hops-dominated beer, you'll like this one, but after one, I don't think I have the tastebuds to tackle another."
"O - Kinda hard to drink what with the massive hop flavor. If you are a hop head you will enjoy this beer. But I only needed one."
"O: A decent DIPA. Would not turn it down, but I don't forsee seeking it out."
"This IIPA poured out as a copper color with a clear looking body to it. The head was very thick looking and white. The lacing was very good also. The smell of the beer had some big citrus aromas coming off of it. There was also some floral and sweet aromas also. The taste of the beer was very good, it had a wonderful hop flavor with some of the lemony orange citrus mixing with the sweetness of the malts . Leaves your mouth tingling and dry. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a good amount of lively carbonation to it. Overall I found this brew to be very good and would totally buy it again if it ever shows up at my local store. Good price and a good brew all in one."
"Overall - I thought this was a pretty decent DIPA. It wasn't blow-me-out amazing but still quite good."
"Hazed orange body. Medium sized off white head....stained to a degree....leaves good lace. Great, great aroma. Resiny and a little pine. Smokey canabis. And tropical fruits, like pineapple and grapefruit. All those aromas translate to perfection onto the palate creating and incredibly flavorful incredibly drinkable DIPA. The flavor I enjoy the most is the resiny, smokey smooth flavor. Also mint, bubblegum and pine. Alcohol is barely perceptible. Bitterness is clean. Very easy to drink....too easy for a 9.1% beer. This is right up there with the best of the best."
"Good beer, aroma is undercover, but flavors are large."
"Not really what I am looking for in a DIPA. I well made brew but not one I think is outstanding for the style."
"IPAs are not my go to beer by any means, but I have been picking some up as of late from the stores. I heard good news about this one and figured I would give it a shot before they were gone. I wouldn’t say that it lived up to what I was hoping, but I did enjoy it. I’ve had better, but I have had many worse. I try to factor in the price when grading a beer and at $10 a 4 pack I think a B grade is more than fair."
"On tap in a tulip glass at pies and pints in morganton, wva. Vibrant copper orange color. Translucent with no head at all. I think I'm influenced by the color by the color but smelling orange , also grapefruit. Mild whiskey smell and pine too. Very enticing. Flavor is less intense than aroma but still good with again combo of citrus and pine. Thin mouthfeel. This went down easy but at 9.1 percent feeling this one. Overall a very good imperial ipa."
"Somewhat remarkably, Lake Eerie Monster doesn't have an ultra-thick mouthfeel. It remains in the vacinity of medium-bodied, which is impressive. Overall, I do think that this is an above average beer for the style. Only barely. It was a good enough drink, even if a disappointment."
"Overall, another great beer by a great brewery! Can't wait to grab another six pack when I visit my folks in a couple weeks!"
"Tasty imperial IPA and quite drinkable. Some cloying sweetness but otherwise no alcohol notes and it goes down well."
"The beer pours a fairly clear golden color with moderate-high clingy white head. The aroma is moderate-high citrus hops. The flavor is highly hoppy--pine and grapefruit with medium-high hop bitterness. The beer finishes quite smooth with a pleasant lingering hop flavor. The body and carbonation are both moderate. Overall a tasty, well-made IIPA."
"Good mouthfeel for a DIPA. Overall, I would prefer the hops to stand out in the flavor as they do in the aroma."
"Maybe not the DIPA that gets all the attention in the beer geek world, but one that hits all the right notes to me."
"O (D) - Super solid, super well-balanced. Not a wow! beer, but it's really good."
"O-A good attempt at the style but the hop profile itself does not balance well with the malt profile. A DIPA is more than tongue splitting IBU's. It still needs some balance in my eyes."
"Darker gold colored brew, pretty clear but certainly some haze. Small white head. Scent is hop nectar, hop juice, and hop syrup. Nice think malty start, very well blended hops, which are certainly large but not overwhelming. Spicy alcohol. Much thinner bodied than i would have thought. Certainly about the hops, but its not overloaded like a lot of the IIPAs. Good brew."
"O: I mentioned the alcohol a few times, and although it wasn't completely distracting it kept me from giving this a higher score. Still a great tasting DIPA."
"Very smooth on the mouth and drinkable. The abv is up as the big drink goes down. Suttle abv while drinking but does sneak apon you nicely."
"Draft to pint. Looks good, but more orange than normal for a DIPA. Smells great; hops and grapefruit. Tastes okay; nothing like it smells. The 9.1% is overly noticeable. Hot. You can taste hops and grapefruit, but it's second-fiddle to the alcohol. Mouthfeel is fine, but nothing to write home about. I'm definitely disappointed. The only thing good about this beer is its smell."
"Overall: This beer could be a lot better. I did enjoy it a lot more than my review would suggest though. A very sweet DIPA with a funky mix of hops."
"I picked this one up at The Party Source yesterday and the best by date is 8/11. It pours a bright gold in color with a one finger bright head. It poured light in body and poured clean and translucent. It smells of light.and muted pineapple with a touch of pale Malta and honey. It tastes of muted pineapple and light citrus hops with a moderately bitter finish. It drinks well for the content and drinks light and not overly dry. It's solid and worth a try."
"Pours a ver pretty hazy yellow orange. Almost golden. A nice touch of white head. Smells incredibly hoppy with tons of pine on the nose. Not a particularlyleseant aroma as o find it unbalanced. The taste is much better. Lots of pine and bitterness. Its surprising.y much better on tap then out of the bottle. Very pleasant"
"This beer pours a hazy orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of bright citrus fruit: tangerines, oranges, lemons, and hints of grapefruit. This is one vibrant smelling beer. The taste has all of the fruit of the aroma with the addition of some nice herbal and floral notes. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good DIPA that I will surely drink again."
"O- A very good IIPA, balances its flavors very well and doesn't beat you over the head with alcohol. It's sweet, but for an IIPA isn't anything too unusual, definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"drinkability is really good for an iipa which are normally too sweet for my taste."
"Pours a hazy gold with little to no head. Smells....kinda weird...slight bit of apricot, slightly flowery but mostly plastic. Tastes a bit better; very peppery-spicy hops. Juicy, pithy orange up front followed by rather harsh bitterness that smoothes out over time. Quite strong. There's another very beguiling flavor that I can't quite pin down in the middle; it's not bad, but not necessarily good...it's a tropical flavor, maybe papaya. A complex and somewhat mysterious IPA that might go well with some Southeast Asian cuisine."
"12pz bottle thanks to Nishino, appreciate it. Yellow color, bubbly with a foamy white head. It smells hoppy it something is slightly off to me. My friend said Amarillo but who knows. The taste was hopped up but there was this sweetness that I just could not get past no matter how hard I tried."
"O - Pretty good, but the alcohol flavors are a little detracting and the resinous character is a little too firm for my taste. But still pretty good drinking on a Thursday night."
"O- Pretty sweet for a DIPA, but an interesting brew nonetheless. It's slighly boozy as well which hurts the overall taste of the beer. Overall, a pretty solid seasonal offering from Great Lakes."
"Terrific pour. Really tight head with a foggy, light copper color. Absolutely great looking brew. Has a nice hoppy nose, with all kinds of malty back. Very strong beer, yet very smooth. Very sticky beer, including the lacing down the glass. Lots of hops that are mellowed down by the amounts of phenomenal malt in the beer. Very easy to drink, almost too easy. Reminds me of what a great double IPA is supposed to be. Excellent beer, I wish I had more than 4!"
"Overall this is a quality product. Some hop oil on the tongue would have been a welcome compliment. While the taste is good, I gave it a slight knock due to the sweetness. Definitely one of the sweeter dipa's I've had to date."
"overall, very good. booze comes out a bit more than id like but drinkable and interesting."
"Overall (4): This beer has a lot of potential and is much better on draft if I recall correctly. The citrus notes are phenomenal but I feel it's a bit too sweet for not being very balanced. The boozy 9% is not well hidden and makes this much less drinkable."
"O: This is a decent DIPA but definitely not part of the elite."
"D - Good drink; solid balance of malt and hop ingredients; didn't feel like a heavy imperial IPA and could be a great beer to match for food pairings"
"A very heavy, rather sweet DIPA. Tasty, but not my favorite example. I'd like more hop character in the flavor, and the sweetness is cranked up way too high."
"Not a bad IPA, pretty balanced any drinkable. But I was expecting a lot more flavor and fragrence from something billed as a double IPA, the flavor was just not there but it was nicely balanced like an IPA should be. I really want to know what makes this a double while Stone Ruination is considered a single."
"If you are a hophead and you have an opportunity to try this - by all means, go ahead. It's not my favorite IIPA (without putting much thought into it, I think I like 3Floyds Dreadnaught and Founders Double Trouble a little bit better), but it's very, very nice. Cheers!"
"O: Nice beer with one or two problems. 4"
"Future outlook: Good in every way, but doesn't quite break out in any way...dunno....I'll be happy to have again, but might not rise to the level of being one to seek out given the abundance of great DIPA's available."
"O- tasty and a nice 2ipa"
"D: This is a beer I'd drink a lot of. Big fruity/floral hop flavor that has a fair amount of bitterness but doesn't burn the palate. Good stuff (4.5)"
"Overall: Pretty good overall, but there are other DIPAs that I would reach for first, and would rather have Great Lake's own Commodore Perry."
"O - a nice beer but not an outstanding beer. Great Lakes rarely disappoints but this is not one of their bests....not the worst either but I wanted so much more."
"I think this has really nice drinkability as the bitterness and booze are in check for the style. A worthy DIPA that I would have again. Well done Great Lakes."
"O- A pretty malty DIPA, has more sweetness and maltiness than most DIPAs I have had, but I like some sweeter and maltier DIPAs and this is a good one."
"The 9.1% is well hidden, and I can tell you from experience that the Monster will whack you if you not careful. This beer is probably my second favorite of all time, and a close second to a beverage that ends with """Slam.""" Perfection."
"This is a fairly un assuming and weak double IPA it seems, I've had plenty of better ones so I think I'll pass on this."
"I REALLY wish they brewed this one year round. It's also a shame that Great Lakes puts this out in 4-packs. Shelling out ~$10.99 for 4 12oz-ers hurts a bit, but it's worth it. Great DIPA."
"O- Excellent IIPA sad this one comes in a four pack. Putting down 2 or so of these in one sitting would be pretty easy, but i wanna conserve. Might have to head back to the shop for another four pack!!!!"
"The mouth feel was good, I really enjoyed drinking this one. You would also never guess that the ABV was over 9%, this beer is very easy to drink. Overall I enjoyed the beer and it is amazing how my tastes have changed over the past year because a year ago I had this beer and was completely turned off by it. Now this is one of my favorite styles of beer and I will be looking forward to this beer every spring."
"O - Very impressed with this. If you are looking for an over hopped IPA, this isn't your beer. This is very balanced. Everything blends perfectly in this brew. It is a shame this one is just a seasonal. Try it while you can!"
"This is a fantastic DIPA and one of the best beers I've had from Great Lakes to date. The aroma and flavor are wonderful, and this beer manages to achieve a great malt/hop balance, which so many DIPAs seem to lack. Also, the alcohol is expertly hidden here-a dangerous beer for sure. Awesome."
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Pours a hazy dark burnt orange with a 1 finger head that sticks around for a while leaving a thick tight bubbly quarter inch lace around the top of glass. Smells of piney hops, citrus, spicy, malty. Nice aroma with a subtle hop blend that is well balanced on the nose. Citrus hops on the tongue, big mango flavor. Sugary malts, bittery olive flavor. Nice on the feel, medium in the mouth, sugary sweet, and bitter. This is an average to good DIPA. Delicious and extremely drinkable."
"O: One of the more drinkable imperial IPAs. I could drink this all day if not for the over 9% ABV."
"O: Another winner from GLBC. Hop-forward, but the malt wasn't forgotten. Great drinkability, these could creep up on you in a hurry."
"O. Overall I'm not too impressed with the style. As a Clevelander, I see a lot of fans of Great Lakes Brewing Co around, but I was honestly hoping from the name of this beer that it would be bolder and have a much stronger character. It's a decent IIPA, but doesn't really do anything special."
"Overall - What a great beer this is. Very malty and sweeter then most dipa's. The alcohol is masked well, but after a couple you will know it. Very underated beer, hope it gets exposed more cause this rivals all the top dipa's out there."
"The bright white head dissembles rapidly leaving goodly and tenacious lacing. Slightly hazy as one expects from an unfiltered beer. The aroma has lots of dank hops. The flavor has solid hop bitterness, with a nice lightly sweet malt profile underneath. The flavors are nicely balanced. This is a smooth, easy drinking beer; a dangerous quality at 9.1% abv."
"Picked up a four-pack at Finger Lakes Beverages in Ithaca, NY. It shows a clear copper color with lots of tiny particulate floating around. The head is fair sized, an off-white color with plenty of lacing. The aroma says banana vinegar and somewhat of a piny hop malt, different but nice. My first mouthful finds both flowery and herbal hops along with a decided caramel malt sweetness. Very nice. It's medium bodied with decent carbonation and a fairly crisp feel. Tangy with a slight lemon-orange edge. This is very nice with fair drinkability."
"Decent drinkability, but a little too sweet for the style. Will try to get a fresher bottle next year."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Pours a hazy orange amber body with a small offwhite head that leaves some sticky sheet lace on the glass. Aroma is surprisingly subdued, but pine resin and grassy hops are noted. Medium body is slightly chewy and has a creamy carbonation. Taste is brazenly hoppy, with a dry pine resin taste from start to finish. Hints of apricot and pink grapefruit struggle to emerge. Toasty caramel maltiness doesn't quite balance the aggressive hop bill. A solid DIPA, but as a big fan of Great Lakes I was hoping for something that would blow me away."
"Overall: One of the few beers lately that I've reviewed that deviates from rDev by more than 10%. I found this rather average. The high level of sweetness of this beer overwhelms the other flavors, and masks any complexity this beer might have."
"My wife drinks red wine to fall asleep some days, this is my red wine."
"D: fairly drinkable though not something i would have on a regular basis."
"Conclusion: an excellent beer, one of the best imperial pale ales I have ever had"
"d- nice, glad i got to try this seasonal, i'd drink this one again! great lakes sure makes good beer."
"Big thanks goes to Lunch for this one in a past trade! Best by date of 08/25/10 (oops!). Code 6857DM. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured red-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and citrus/bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hops, and weak alcohol on the followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I wish I had the opportunity to try this one while it was fresh, but it was still pretty damn tasty. It had a nicely balanced flavor and good aroma to go along with it. Definitely glad I got an opportunity to try this one. It is a must try for any fan of the IIPA out there."
"D: Goes down very easily, big kick, somewhat filling, nice representation of style. If it weren't for the ABV, I would sit with this one all night."
"Mouthfeel is fine, the carbonation works well, there is malt sweetness to spare, it's generally drinkable... but why drink it when it's just average DIPA. Sure it goes down pretty good, but it's no hop monster, nothing special. I want less alcohol, more flavor, MORE HOPS (the hophead's lament). I certainly won't go out of my way to get this again (but great thanks to Norma, who brought me bottles from Cleveland!!)"
"D/O- A delicious beer here. Most wouldn't want more than one of the Lake Erie Monster but it's good enough that others might want to have another. I <3 Great Lakes Brewing Company."
"D: The mouthfeel and alcohol makes this hard to give it a high drinkability/session rating but the complexity makes me want to come back over and over..."
"Pouring this into a tall glass it produces a thick buttery colored head. Slightly cloudy, honey colored. An unexpected amount of sediment. Peculiar haziness is probably a combination of that and the very slow rising bubbles. The yeast chunks (yes, chunks, that look like flakes) ride on the bubbles and actually look sorta cool. Smells less hoppy than when fresh, but still pungent. Pine, grass, some alcohol and malt evident. Full mouthfeel with nice creamy texture. Light carbonation but head lingers, 1/8""" after downing half. Moderate lacing, which seems to improve as I drink it down. When fresh, I describe this as a tongue scraper. While I'm not a hophead, this beer defies my preferences and prejudices. Strong malt backbone tempers the bitterness. Tastes almost as strong as it is with a good balance. Hoppiness is subdued yet assertive. Finishes with a resinous hoppy aftertaste. Not my everyday beer, but a welcome treat."
"Overall: This is a good representation of the style and another great beer from GLBC. It was extremely drinkable and tasted like a heavier, more muted version of their Commodore Perry IPA, and that is the only problem I had with it; it is just a tad bland. It isn't bad tasting, but a little lacking on flavour. Still, a very solid brew."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sweet, it's citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit, apricots) and pine hops, honey, and some sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma (but a bit stronger), it's sweet and fruity, and also has a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and a bit rich with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. At a little over 9%, the alcohol content is well hidden. A little on the sweet side for me, but the bottle was more than likely past it's prime..."
"D: At approximately 9% ABV this beer is fairly drinkable, though this is somewhat limited by the intensity of the bitter finish. I wouldn't want to have more than 1-2 of these in the same day. Still, a very tasty and interesting beer."
"A very nice, well-balanced DIPA with a pretty strong malt profile. Very different from the big hop bomb West Coast IPA's I've had, but pretty solid. This was bottled about 2 months ago though, and may have lost some hop character."
"Pours a beautiful golden with a solid, bubbly head. Smells of grassy and citrusy hops with some maltiness thrown in. Very complex body. There are a ton of tongue-searing hops a solid bready and caramel base. The bitterness is prolonged after each sip, handily overpowering the malt backbone. Lots of grassy, piny and some citrus hop flavors. Very delicious and full-bodied. Some alcohol flavors creep in, especially as it warms, but do not detract from the delicious hops."
"D: This was really disappointing, I must say. Neither the nose nor the flavor were like anything you would expect from a DIPA."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Munich malt scent along with a fairly aggressive hop aroma. It's bitter with a balanced with a sweet and bready character. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale and Munich malt flavor. It's sweet with some light breadiness. The hop taste is outstanding. It's quite bitter with a complex malt profile. The mouthfeel is great! It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine DIPA. It's well balanced with great hop character; a good drinker."
"Overall a fantastic beer."
"Whichever....It's good beer."
"D- I've been lucky enough to have this beer many times over. I do enjoy it but can only have a couple pints before I'm done. Another beer from Great Lakes that is knocked out of the park with the style."
"Not a bad IPA, just not sure if I will buy again. The taste was a little strange for me in an IPA."
"D: Its ok for a DIPA. Its to heavy on the malt for me. I'll prob buy another 4 pack next year. I'll stick with Burning River for now!"
"I checked out this excellent IPA at the malt House from a fresh tapper. The head was perfect, smooth, rich, almost creamy. The hop aroma was rich, somewhat citrusy, somewhat floral, but very rich. At 9.1% it was a potent treat with great mouth feel. The anticipated bitterness after tasting was there and very pleasant. Another excellent beer from Great Lakes, who I consider a very consistent brewery."
"Drinkability: It's lacking in the hoppy department and there are better examples out there. I wouldn't turn it down if handed to me, but won't seek it out."
"This is more of a malty IIPA. Good but slightly dissapointed fro such a highly regarded beer."
"D: Great mouthfeel, disappointed flavor for a DIPA. If this is going to dance with the heavy hitters of the sport it has a long way to go. Still, by itself it is definitely drinkable, but there are better things I'd spend my money on."
"D- this beer attacks your palate pretty hard, I would have a hard time putting down more than one or two in a sitting, with that being said it is still a very solid DIPA"
" D- The sweetness and hops are well blended and full but it was not huge hops like I was expecting. Very drinkable for such a big beer."
"The flavors are a little surprising, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet malt base which seemed to wash over the hops at points. Perhaps this bottle was a little past its prime, but this isn't the first time I'm trying this beer."
"Great Lakes is one of my favorite breweries, and this beer certainly doesn't threaten its status as so."
"D- with reviewing it this close to the """enjoy by""" date I can say that it is still really drinkable; the bitterness is there, but it's a drinkable bitterness and a great beer option for people just getting into DIPA's; with some DIPA's the beer gets so malty and sweet as it ages past its prime, but the hop flavor has held up well; some alcohol detection"
"Take this one slow. The heat and the sweetness don't make for a session beer."
"D: Hoppiness is well balanced with malt and alcohol flavors making this a complex beer suitable for sipping. Yet the hoppiness makes it a nice complement to a fish or salmon dinner."
"Poured a clear orange/honey gold color. Plenty of head that faded into a lot of very sticky lacing. The smell wasn't what I expected from a DIPA. Very sweet and malty but still a good bit of citrus and pine from the hops. The taste was very much the same. Starts off very sweet and malty but fades into citrus (grapefruit) as its swallowed. Leaves a lingering hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel was full and left my mouth feeling coated and sticky. Drinkability was very good and alcohol was very much hidden. Not a DIPA but more of an English style IPA on steroids, in my opinion."
"Not to style, but decent tasting. A bit to wet and heavy to be very drinkable. Wow, I'm amazed at how little I have to say about a DIPA, but there isn't much here."
"D - The very best aspect of this beer. It's very drinkable, not my favorite D-IPA, but for us hop heads, it's definitely worth a try."
"D:A very tasty, easy to drink, smooth DIPA. One of the better ones I have had this year so far and the best offering I have ever had from Great Lakes in general. Can't wait till next years release to enjoy this one again"
"Overall, it's an OK DIPA. It's just not too balanced with the sugary sweetness clashing with a big dank bitterness."
"Thanks Dan for pulling out another one I had wanted to try at the great tasting a couple weeks back. Poured a nice medium copper color, with a little bit of off-white foam on top. Although this one was a little bit old, it still had a pretty nice hop character, and a very good malt/hop balance, with a solid alcoholic kick near the end. Another good one from a brewery I need to try more beers from."
"A high ABV lowers the drinkability a bit, but I'd certainly enjoy another any time."
"Pours a golden amber with about a finger and a half of off-white head which quickly settles to a bubbly collar, yet reappears with a quick swirl. Quite solid retention given the age on this. Carbonation streaming form the bottom of this, and the clarity is quite hazy. Smells of peaches, tangerine, mango and some other light tropical fruits, heavy on the malt here also. Taste is lead by the sweet toffee and caramel malt and fruits, the big malt hits first and in quick and almost simultaneous succession the tropical fruits appear again. Leaves a touch of lingering bitterness on the tongue, and a burn of alcohol is present with this also. Mouthfeel is quite full, ABV is detectable and is fairly creamy and smooth throughout. Drinkable, but 1 bottle of this is enough for a sitting. Would love to try this super fresh!"
"The beer was a nice golden color, which is a good sign in a DIPA because it means that the caramel and residual sweetness should be low, although there was relatively little head when I poured the beer into a snifter. The aroma was a bit lacking, I smelled mostly yeast esters, alcohol and a little grapefruit rind. The taste was also a bit lackluster. The bittering was a little bit lacking for a DIPA and the hop flavors were not as bright and assertive as they should have been. There was a little biscuity malt and some zesty citrus rind, but overall there was not much hops. The mouthfeel was slick and a low level of carbonation with a semi-dry finish. The alcohol was well hidden, lower bitterness, and the finish allows this beer to drink more like an American IPA, and is perhaps a bit too drinkable to a fault."
"Another solid offering by Great Lakes, think Burning River on steroids."
"Bottle. Pours a orange amber color with a nice looking 1-2 finger head that also has a lisght orange tinge to it. The aroma is mostly of citrus with very little pine, some other fruit notes as well. Sweet smelling as well. Very sweet up front followed by a crisp citrus like bitterness. Bitterness lingers on. Very little, if any, alcohol flavors present. The hop bitterness is kind of wierd, it kicks in almost like a second after you think it should. Just an ok dipa in my opinion."
"Golly, another fantastic offering from Great Lakes. Shouldn't be surprised, I guess. I believe in the Lake Erie Monster, I do, I do."
"Pours a clear, orange color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight grain, slight earthy malt, slight yeast, floral hops, citrus, sweet malt, and alcohol. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, yeast, slight grain, citrus, and hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and body."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is resiny hops with some sweet malt and citrus notes. The flavor is orange citrus with some resiny hops. The bitterness is about medium. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: I've had worse DIPAs, but that is hardly a glowing endorsement. A disappointing drink, from a brewery that is usually spot on. C'est La Vie..."
"This medium-bodied ale was good; I do enjoy IPAs and hoppiness. But it was a little too bitter and unbalanced, even for me."
"When I first had this a couple years ago, I detested it because it was just too much. Now, I can certainly appreciate it for what it is. In a craft beer world seemingly dominated by malty DIPA's, this one sticks out."
"Thanks to afatty for selling me a bottle from his stash for 2 bucks! 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp bubbly orange with a decent off white head that shows the oval etched in the bottom of the glass and slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves just a trace of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice abundance of grassy hops in front of sweet malts. The taste is a nice amount of grassy pine hops with a nice amount of burnt caramel malts backing them up, followed by a nice lingering bitter pine finish. The beer is a bit heavy with some sticky alcohol, but nothing too overbearing. I have been a fan of Great Lakes for years, and had high hopes for this DIPA, and they did not disappoint."
"D: Pretty good. I usually have one and then switch to another beer."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is harsh and bitter, there is a bit too much burn in the mouth. This is better on tap than in bottles, but still not high on my list of favorite iipas."
"D: For a DIPA, this has potential and should be enjoyed fresh. No off flavors and still enjoyable to drink, the hops had faded enough that the malt flavors were a little too much. But still not bad."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Disappointing on both counts."
"Served up a fairly dark and slightly orange amber with a head that is between off-white and tan. It is a nice sticky, frothy head that one would expect on a nice double, and it leaves nice lace on the tulip as I imbibe this beer. The nose: not nearly as appealing. If I was to think of a DIPA as a sea monster, I would imagine it would have an aggressive and assaulting hop aroma. This beer is much, much sweeter than it is hoppy. Sure there are hints of citrus zest, and some herbal, more British notes, but the nose is mostly dominated by sweet, dark malt. The flavor is also disappointing in that, like the aroma, it is lacking in the hop department, even though I know this is a fairly fresh keg. The first thing I pick up is an odd cherry like flavor and malts that have kind of a brown ale nutty thing going on. Not unpleasant at all, but weird in a double IPA. The hops that are present seem to be neck in neck between herbal, earthy and orange. Bitterness is totally buried by the malt bill. The mouthfeel is medium and it finishes fairly clean, not as sticky as I would have expected. This beer hides its strength well, but I really would not be too interested in having another for a very long time. Great brewery, not such a great offering."
"D: I would drink this anytime. Alcohol is hidden quite well."
"D: more than one would overwhelm the palate."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is still a fairly tasty beer, but with so many other good DIPA's on the market I'll probably pass on this next time. The overall flavor seems a bit muddled and the ABV is somewhat more noticeable than I would like. However, if I get the chance to revisit this at the brewery, straight from the tap, then I'll probably give it another try. Worth checking out, but fairly average."
"I would love to try this beer absolutely fresh to see if I am missing some of the flavor. It's great otherwise, still very enjoyable."
"Decent DIPA. Unfortunately, it doesn't really live up to expectations and isn't a standout for the style. It's a nice looking beer. Transparent, light to medium gold, and a tight, white cap. The aroma is relatively weak, particularly in terms of hops. Hops are floral and a bit piney. The malt is a bit strong, contributing lots of caramel. There's some pepper and spice in there, too. The flavor has too much residual sweetness for my taste, but there's some good lingering bitterness. It's just a bit too simple and weak in hops. It needs more of the delicate hop notes of the best in the style. The beer has some good body, though the sweetness really hurts it for me. It's an alright beer, though not something that I'd trade for again or seek out otherwise."
"Overall, this is not a very well done dipa. Ihad high expectations from this one since it is coming from Great Lakes but I was let down. Not very drinkable in my opinion."
"Just another tasty treat from the boys from Cleveland."
"Notes: I love everything that Great Lakes touches, and this is no exception. The citrus and mouthfeel won me over instantly on this beer."
"Flavor is sweet and malty with lots of caramel malt to balance the citrus and earthy pine resin , nice level of bitterness ,long sweet ,hoppy finish , creamy mouthfeel , full body , and a good sessionable drinker for the high ABV ."
"Drinkability is hurt by the alcohol - tasty, though definitely boozy. It's something when a 9+ abv DIPA tastes bigger than it is. The mouthfeel is key to this one, quite nice overall."
"D: At over 9% abv, it is quite drinkable! I've had some better IIPAs or DIPAs or whatever you prefer to call it, but I would have it again. Would love to try it on-tap."
"D= Not the best imperial ipa I have ever had, but it is still a great beer. I thought it was a little too sweet, but I know I will be drinking more in the near future."
"Thanks again, TJ!"
"D: Sweetness makes this a great beer to sip on for a while, don't know if I could take too many of these. Especially with the ABV. Goes down a bit too easy, though. ;-)"
"D: Not the best in its style -- and let's be honest, the style has a lot of competition -- but it's really solid. I would drink it again."
"One of my favorite dipas-right up there with double crooked tree, hopslam and double trouble."
"Pours a cloudy dark yellow color with 2 finger of head that faded slowly with thick lacing. A big citrus hop nose, as expected, but also a grassy/cooked veggie aroma. Big, sticky sweet body upfront immediately followed by a sharp bitterness that stays until the finish, where some malt sweetness creeps back in. The finish is lingering and very warm - there's not hiding the 9% here. Drinkability is decent for this big of a beer."
"This isn't something I could sit and drink a 4 pack of due to the ABV but its really quite delicious... Intense and bitter and oily and hoppy... Very very nice... Nice job Great Lakes..."
"Easiest to drink, impressive, and high abv, IPA out there"
"Overall: This stuff compares favorably to 90 Minute IPA. Overall, Lake Erie Monster is not as balanced with the hops and malts, tending to swing heavily in the favor of spicy hops. That said, there are really no huge differences. So you can easily interchange these beers."
"D: I remember liking this beer more when I had it earlier this year. Right now it's good, but it's not blowing me out of the water anymore. Still, I could drink a couple of these very enjoyably."
"D/ Extremely drinkable I believe, especially for the style. These styles can be too overly intense with uneven hop flavor where as this Imperial IPA you can very much taste the malt and balance. Of course you must be a hop lover. Remember that this beer is an Imperial IPA."
"The body is medium and sits heavy on the palate. Overall this is an extremely tasty beer, and one that I would enjoy in small doses."
"Great Lakes makes Great Beer. Lake Erie Monster is no exception. If you live in Great Lakes' back yard, consider yourself blessed."
"Drinkability: Wow, a great find as I wander into a bar to grab a bite. While super hoppy isn't always my style, this is a great and powerful wonder."
"Pours a clear orange-brown (which is lighter than I would expect from this style) with a nice white head. The head disappears quickly but laces like crazy! The aromas coming off the beer are dominated by the hops: spicy, piney, a bit of fruit in there (peaches?). Then I take a sip. Holy cloying sweetness Batman! Caramel, burnt sugar, sugar, sweetness. Thick and sticky to the palate. This takes the beer down a few notches in scoring. I am not sure I can consumer more than one (and I was planning on doing so). As DIPAs go, I wanted to love it (it was sold to me on high recommendation at the store, and I have three more to go), but the sweetness was just too much."
"Lake Erie Monster came to me looking bright gold with some small amounts of bronze beneath a semi off white head with some legs, leaving some stick. Smells included malts and grain on top of a diminished hop profile under all the sweetness. Some caramel, small grapefruit, sweetmess prevails. Taste is lopsided as well. Malts rule the roost with pale taste plus sweet malt leading to some caramel. Under that is a small tropic fruit thing with the usual suspects. An odd yeast taste afterwardsm not to bright. The feel is kinda on point though, it's pretty much in the middle with a active carb for it. Could stand to be more bitter though. Some alcohol, very slight. This is OK beer but not something I would try again, OK maybe a super fresh bottle would change things."
"Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster is a IIPA that is on the malty side. A little bit too malty for me, actually. It isn't a bad beer, but as far as Great Lakes goes, which is a stellar brewery, it is a bit of a disappointment."
"Great beer. One of if not my favorite IPA"
"Drinks great here few hang ups and light on abv for style."
"Notes: Awesome DIPA in my book. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but its not boozy in any way, just warming."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Very little head, copper orange color. Strong scents of fruits: pineapple, orange and grapefruit. Hops are strong with some pine notes. Flavor is more hop forward, somewhat well balanced malt like backbone. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily and thick. This is more of a sipper, than refreshing. Certainly an enjoyable beer."
"Overall this is a great beer. i highly recommend it anyone looking for a hop heavy beer. Another +1 for Great Lakes."
"D - Pretty good brew. Has a nice bitter bite but isn't overwhelming. Kind of gives me a warming feeling that betrays its higher ABV. I would pick this up again if I saw it but wouldn't go nuts trying to obtain it."
"Drinkable and enjoyable overall. This isn't quite up to the level of something like Pliny the Elder, but it's definitely a great DIPA that I wouldn't pass up in the future."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber with a frothy head and thick lacing. Scent is fruity and of grapefruit. Taste is similar - hoppy and grapefruit. I've read about and have had many IPAs that are supposed to have a grapefruit taste, but for me, this takes the cake. The mouthfeel is semi-thick and is decently drinkable."
"Despite the maltiness of this, a couple of these could be consumed consecutively."
"Drinkability: $10 for a 4-pack isn't steep, especially for a brew as tasty as this, but for me it's entirely too good to just sip on for a long period of time. I've been waiting to try this for a while, and I'm glad I was finally able to find it. Can't wait to try more seasonals I haven't had as they're available."
"Notes: The flavor is outstanding and nicely balanced with may disappoint hard core hop heads. For me there is just enough hop bitterness to make me happy. This is also one of the easiest to drink beers around the 9% range. Overall I feel this is an exceptional IIPA!!!"
"This is a nice Imperial IPA. Certainly not a hop bomb as some here have complained. This is its strength to my mind: a pretty Imperial with a complexity that benefits from a restrained use of hops, allowing the bready and candied sweetness to come through. Pleasant."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable take on the style by one of my favorite breweries. Look forward to having it again."
"Drinkability: A unique tasting beer, and one that I'm glad I got a chance to try. While it isn't bad, the hardcore hop-head in me was really hoping for a hop blast. I'd say try it if you can get it, but don't go crazy trying to score a bottle."
"D- good stuff and rather drinkable. I really enjoyed it."
"One of the best breweries in American alot of the stuff I cut my teeth on back in the day was from this great brewery.Poured into a standard pint glass a slight hazed burnt orange with a clingy 1/2 finger white head that had great lasting power.Aromas were of sweet alcohol and resiny hop,neither one stood out more than the other really.Big and sweet on the palate, the alcohol dipped fruit and caramel malt flavors really was more prevailing than the resiny hop.Like alot of DIPA's this is more sweet than hop driven,its a good beer but not what Iam lookin for,bummer."
"Pours a clean, pale orange color with an off white head. In the aroma, sticky hops and a small alcohol hint. In the taste, alcohol and a small, sticky pine like hop. A bitter bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sticky hop aftertaste. Big alcohol presence and quite sticky. OK, but nothing too exciting."
"D - This is a really smooth DIPA. Bitterness isn't extreme, but hop flavor really shines. Love the creamy feel too. Alcohol is largely unnoticeable...probably goes down way too easily."
"Misses the mark. I admit I also after drinking perused reviews to see how the range of palates saw this beer. My guess is I most of come across a funky batch or mishandled batch, but with a best by date well over a month and half from now, it is only a guess. Willing to try again, but I won't seek it out."
"Very impressed. This is comparable to Hopslam, if it were made with Simcoe. Nowhere near as drinkable as Hopslam, nowhere near as good, but almost half the price. I will gladly drink it up."
"Drinkability: A very nice DIPA, though it lacks a little in the citrus department; plenty of bitterness and not at all sticky"
"D - Well I bought this on the assumption that it would be terrible as forum posts suggest but it ended up being a nice spicy IPA. That being said I really don't love my IPA's being spicy so I may not try this again anytime soon. It was a nice different IPA though that other may enjoy more."
"D: Drinkability suffers a bit due to thin mouthfeel and sweetness. Still a pretty good IPA though, I'm glad I got to try it."
"Got a bottle thanks to a good friend. Pours a cloudy amber/orange with a pretty small head. I love the color and the hazy. Nose is subdued a bit but is grapefruit, apricot, orange, and sugar cookie. Taste up front has a pine bitterness bite, followed by pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors, moving to a sugary malt presence, and finishes with a decent bitterness. Pretty consistent profile as it warms, minimal alcohol presence. Nice medium mouth. This is one of those """balanced""" IIPAs the east coast and midwest types love, and I can get behind this one. A surprising delight."
"Drinkability: There's no alcohol presence while being fairly high at 9.1% but it's still easy to drink and a couple of these would go down pleasantly. It's balanced for a IIPA, guess the brewer woke up on the East side of the bed on this brew day. If you want a hop centric beer only, then this won't suit you but it's still a well-made beer."
"If you like double IPAs, this is a good one."
"O excellent beer for the hop head. I would love to have this on tap."
"Drinkability -- Nothing in this beer really jived with me: the hops were bitter and earthy, the malts were sweet and nutty, and the alcohol was biting even for the style. I'm likely going to gift the other three at a get-together, but your mileage may vary."
"Taste: More orange and grapefruit dominating the taste. Sweet with a nice bitterness. A little thicker feel than one would get from most DIPA's."
"In the end, bottled Lake Erie Monster is a little bit better than on-tap Lake Erie Monster. However, it still isn't the hop-soaked beer that I'd hoped it would be. Oh well, there's still the awesomeness of Edmund Fitzgerald and Burning River and Dortmunder Gold and Eliot Ness and Holy Moses and Blackout Stout... and on and on and on."
"D- This is a good brew overall. One of the sweeter DIPAs for me in recent memory. This is certainly no 'monster' but its a good starter DIPA. I was expecting a bit more of a punch-but this is a nice sweet brew."
"A: A finger thickness of head off a hard pour that sticks around for a while, medium gold in color, a few spots of sticky foam in the interior - 3.75, S: I'm struggling to pull a lot of the nose but a strong swirl does bring out some citrus and a touch of nuttiness, alcohol is evident, as an imperial I was expecting to be blown away but the nose was somewhat of a letdown - 2.50, What the nose lacked, the palate pushes in the right direction, lots of bittering hops and a decent pine bite, obvious alcohol which provides a drying element on the tongue, mild rum and faint syrupy sweetness in the background, a touch of honey as well - 3.75, M: Creamy and quite full bodied mouth feel - 4.00, D: All and all a good beer but the nose was somewhat of a disappointment, alcohol was a touch disruptive - 3.00"
"The mouthfeel was short and pleasant and for the strength it was highly drinkable. Probably the best Great Lakes effort I have had to date."
"This is a decent enough DIPA (especially if one prefers the East Coast style of IPA), but it's just too sweet and boozy for my taste. Had this side by side with a glass of sculpin and stone double dry hopped IPA, and to say the Erie Monster was the least impressive of the group would be an understatement."
"This is an atypical double IPA; it definitely wasn't a hop bomb to me. Very drinkable and solid."
"D- A less aggressive DIPA IMHO. Still plenty of hops but not as bitter as some. A great drinker on a hot summer's night."
"Drinkability:This intensely hoppy, strong pale ale does hit the style pretty squarely, but there's something missing to make it a beer I want to come back for again and again."
"D: This is an execllent example of the style. It is completely over the top with malts and hops, yet it is not punishing to drink. I could easily think about opening another bottle after finishing the first. Well done Great Lakes. Highly recommended for anyone who likes hops."
"Good, but not great."
"Drinkability is pretty good for a 9% beer. The alcohol is masked well and it's relatively smooth. It's a decent brew, but don't expect a hop bomp because it's far from it."
"D: A really nice IPA from Great Lakes. A high ABV does not make this sessionable, but a very tasty IPA."
"YES! This beer was killer tasting. By far one of the best IPAs I have tried. Starts off bitter and then the sweet citrus comes through and then the bitter again. What surprised me most was the balance of this beer. As the beer got warmer, the taste got better and more distinctive. With and ABV of 9.10% I am not sure I could drink alot of these in one session but I would love to try someday (when I have a ride home). Overall one of my new favorites and I will certainly be drinking this one again soon."
"Overall- i've been waiting for years to try this one and i was alil disappointed. i mean it could be hoppier. their website states the commadore perry has a higher ibu rating but i can't believe it. all this thing has is bitterness but not alot hop taste to back it up. great lakes needs to work on their ipa's!!"
"Overall: Quality brew from a great brewery, I recommend picking this up if you get the chance."
"I was really excited to see this on the shelf. It didn't quite live up to what I had idealized for it, but it is surely worth a try."
"Drinkability - Quite so. I do not taste any alcohol heat and this is quite quaffable in my opinion. A refreshing beer to enjoy after a long day in the sun."
"D- quite drinkable for a DIPA , just not a noteworthy one"
"D- It can be a difficult beer to drink for how bitter it is. I would say it's average, but the taste is so exceptional that it keeps bringing you back for more."
"One of great lakes better beers here."
"A solid DIPA, certainly, but as a fan of Great Lakes I was hoping for something to knock my socks off. This one just lacks the """Wow""" factor for some reason."
"I'm glad I took my time and scoured the shelves of Chevy Chase before I left, for lo, and behold: singles of Lake Erie Monster (among others, of course). Yay, I didn't have to buy a whole 4-pack. By the by, I'm cheap and tentative. My prize pours a clear apricot Jolly Rancher with a bit less than a finger of white foam on top. The nose comprises a deeply resin-y pine, heavy on the sap, a sort of mentholyptus effect, and violets. I suspect some caramel or something is hiding somewhere in there, but the 'lyptus is just too powerful, as though someone who's just devoured several cough drops is breathing heavily into my snifter. Luckily, the rest of the hoppy aromas mingle nicely with this semi-unexpected guest. The formally shy caramel shows up in the taste, though the conversation is still dominated by the pine resins. You can feel the stickiness in the taste, even before a true mouthfeel can be determined. Some citrus notes occasionally bring up new topics, but the pines and 'lypti (sure, that's the plural form...) take the ideas and run marathons. I'd rate this higher, but it all just seems overtly one-sided and overloaded with pine and fake-mint. The body is medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a somewhat chewy, definitely sticky feel. This one is almost there, but I think needs a tad more malt for proper balance (or something like that)."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice flavors to it for sure. Although it hid the high alcohol content very well it did feel like a pretty big beer. I would say it was very drinkable in a moderate serving size, but I probably wouldn't open another one tonight."
"D-This is perhaps the easiest drinking DIPA I've had. Very full-flavored and just a great beer. The punch in the face aroma you usually get with DIPA's is absent here but the taste more than makes up for that."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much super special about this one. This beer kinf of give me the """just another beer""" feel. Not a good feeling. Ok."
"This is ok for a DIPA but I am really not in love with it. It's sweeter than I like, and could use more hop bitterness to balance that out. I think the Commodore Perry is quite a bit more bitter actually. The fruit qualities are different than the norm and that's a redeeming quality, but this just isn't my sort of DIPA. Worth trying if you prefer a more balanced IPA/DIPA, rather than a hop bomb."
"I'm generally a fan of Great Lakes brewery, but this one leaves me scratching my head with one hand and ordering a Dreadnaught with the other."
"Overall this is another high quality brew from Great Lakes and I will look forward to its release with great relish next year!"
"drinkability: ok"
"D- sadly, this one left me pretty disappointed. and from one of my favorite breweries also. combine that disappointment with a 3.50/single bottle price tag and you get something i probably wont seek out again."
"_:_ I was kinda dissapointed in this one, maybe if it was called a Imperial Amber ale it would be percieved better, but when your thinking DIPA this is not what you are wanting."
"Libation: I like a lot of facets of this beer, but it just doesn't come together well. I'm told Fuggle hops are used here, and I've never been a huge fan, so maybe that's the issue, but I suspect there is a bit more to it. To me there is a great malt backbone, but there just isn't enough of a complex hop flavor to carry the day."
"D - A very good DIPA. It seemed like it was so close to being a great DIPA but one little thing (that I cannot quite pin point) was off."
" If you get the chance try it. it's still flying off the shelves around here. That pretty much tells the story in my eyes!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet, and silky in the finish. A bit of astringent flavors left behind."
"Notes: With a difference so far this is the most avoidable Great Lakes brew I've encountered. Typically they offer quality and great work with a nice range. Unfortunately this is not the occasion. Good for those that love this offering, but for me not only it feels overhyped but rather avoidable."
"A biggie, for sure -- not bad, some interesting things in there, but a little formidable for me. One is plenty."
"Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. One of the easiest drinking DIPAs I have come accross. Worthy."
"D - not really getting this one. odd choice of hops to build a DIPA around, and the alcohol is WAY too hot and very distracting."
"D - A good DIPA, although alcohol is poorly hidden. If it were less hot I could see this being a great beer, although it's worthy as it is."
"Overall not bad, didn't really blow me away, but i'd drink it again."
"The taste is heavy, just a little sweet and more bitter than I expected based on the smell. It lacks the over the top piney smell and greasy hop feel I want when I look forward to a DIPA, but it's still a delicious and drinkable beer. Not at the top of my list, but one I will enjoy again."
"Recommended."
"Served in a snifter glass, $5.50 for a 10oz pour. Nice amber color with barely any head when it got to the table. Looks very inviting. Smell was nice, I can tell right away it's not a hop bomb. Bit of pine, citrus and candy in the aroma. Taste was very nice as well, sweeter than expected. Thicker mouth feel with nice carbonation. Drinkability was high for me. I had 3 snifters with dinner and enjoyed them all. Glad I finally knocked this off my """wants""" list. If your looking for the more """balanced""" dipa then this is a great beer for you. I like mine more hop forward, but that being said, I really enjoyed this offering from Great Lakes."
"Another VERY solid beer from Great Lakes and something that I look forward to drinking again."
"D: As much as I liked this beer, by the end of the glass I was really ready to be done with it. I felt the alcohol presence was just too """in your face""". To each his own, right?"
"Because the hops are so subtle, the mouthfeel is enjoyable and, well, tolerable -- something other truly big DIPAs eschew for in-your-face hoppiness. I liked this brew more than most most Imperial IPAs. It hides its 9.1% well. But on some level, I feel like I am being cheated out of a certain bombast I expect from a seasonal Imperial. Still, recommended."
"6/5/2010"
"*I had this on tap recently as well but enjoyed the bottle more (and had already written the bottle review)*"
"This is an all-around delicious, well-balanced beer. Par for the course for Great Lakes. Though some balance could be sacrificed for the brightness and loudness that IIPAs beg for. While it's not a standout, I could drink this anytime, anywhere. No IIPA is session material, but this dares a person to try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and biting."
"D: I'm glad Great Lakes put this beer out. Yes there are a ton of IPAs/DIPAs out there, but this one has some unique qualities which make it worth checking out. This doesn't quite do it for me like Abrasive/Hopslam/Double Trouble/PtE does, but great beer nonetheless."
"This is very drinkable, but you can easily detect the 9.1% ABV. This keeps the rating down a little."
"Drinkability: It definitely drinks like the Commodore's big brother. Hoppier for sure, but I find that the flavor retains a nice balance and is ever easier to drink. Definitely a fan of a quaffable DIPA."
"I was expecting another run of the mill DIPA from this (despite typically loving most GLBC beers) and ended up being very impressed with this. Initially at colder temperatures the flavor starts off with a strong bready and grainy body before the citrus hops take over and finish with a flourish of honey like sweetness. As the beer warms further, the hops and sweetness almost completely take over and our supported by a thick, creamy and smooth soft body. Appearance is a hazed, yet clear deep honey amber with a light creamy head that leaves a large amount of thin webs of lacing. Aroma was the only letdown in this as it wasn't as complex or strong as expected and had a mild cattiness. Regardless, this is a great, sweet, hoppy DIPA and is recommended."
"Finally....Thanx to D Kurtz for landing me a 4 pack, from Slappy's in Ashtabula Oh. Tried to wait for the weekend to open, Couldn't do it. Poured into a Great Lakes Pilsner glass, 2 inch bone white head, sweet copper/orange, crystal clear hue. Smell of fresh Hop, toffee with a lot of citrus thrown in, a touch of alcohol. Medium body and carbonation and a nicely resinous mouth feel and a bit of chewiness. Starts off quite malty, but the hops come on quickly with bitter citrus and a long very dry finish. My mouth is still coated with malty goodness, 15 min after my last sip. A little different than most Double/Imperial IPA's. But 1 Hell of a beer."
"Overall I was extremely impressed with this beer. I was going in with low expectations of it being """Just another DIPA.""" I was promptly put in my place by the beer. Excellently balanced, great non-traditional hopping (Thanks for no Amarillo!). I could get lost in the nose and actually gives me hope that maybe there are brewers out there who actually do know how to expand on the DIPA style, rather than just rehash what the west coast is doing."
"This is waaay too easy drinking for nearly 10% abv. This could lead to problems if you're not careful! Glad I have more!"
"D- This take on the style did not impress me much. The alcohol is not as apparent in the taste as it is in the aroma. The vegetable aspect kills it for me."
"D: Great beer. Perfect for a hot summer day. Went down easy for the alcohol in this and was delicious."
"I'm being really picky, its a good dipa, not great."
"Overall I had no problem finishing off a few of these so that's a positive for drinkabilty. Solid all around."
"Drinkability: This is really a pretty refreshing DIPA, despite the weight and higher ABV. I would love to get through more than the two that I managed to get through, but the ABV would definitely prevent me from having any more, especially considering that I had to drive (boo!). I love the more bitter presence of the hops that come in the draught version and I really do wish that this was a year-round offering. Cheers to GLBC!"
"2.5 D: It's not too bad, but it the malt and hop combo give a goofy-ish sweet fruitiness that doesn't really appeal to me."
"D: A decent DIPA, but not the """monster""" I was expecting. Decent hop flavor tamed by sweet malts and a minimal bitterness results in a beer that is probably easier to drink than it should be."
"Great job Great Lakes!"
"D: This is a very nice imperial IPA from Great Lakes, with a pleasant flavor. I wouldn't put this is the upper echelon of DIPAs, but it's still a good beer. A somewhat atypical hoppiness, so this is definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"i wouldn't want to session, but i would drink again"
"D- I really enjoyed this; something a little different from the other DIPAs I've had."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've been waiting for quite some time for this beer to be bottled and thrown into the Great Lakes line-up. I'm glad to say, it doesn't disappoint. I had it on-tap a couple of years back at the brewery and I liked it a bit better (alc. content was 10.1% then), but this is definitely comparable."
"Beer is medium bodied with tons of bright fruity hop flavors. Lots of mango and citrus hop flavors. There is a lot of malty sweetness up front. Its a little too sweet for my tastes in IPA. Still pretty good."
"I am partial to GLBC though. I live about a mile from them and have always liked their beers."
"Taste starts with a touch of toasted malt, but this is largely taken over by herbal, bitter, delicious hops. Lots of citrus and pineapple flavor throughout the palate. Sugary, caramelly malt backbone shows up and so does some fruity alcohol. Big tropical fruit and citrus/herbal hop finish. Mostly drying, with some lingering sweetness. Full-bodied with a creamy to sticky feel. Big and bold and tasty!"
"A good beer, but not what I expected from a IIPA - sure, up front there is the big, hoppy wallop, closely followed by a somewhat syrupy sweetness that usuall accompanies the hops assault. Then, rather oddly, the hops melt away at the finish. Rather than the long, lingering bitterness clinging to the back of the tongue, this beer sort of finishes up and moves on. Interesting."
"The 9% ABV is barely percieved, no alcohol burn and no over-sweetened effect. Great beer."
"D- Not sure on the price point, but if I had access I'd enjoy a few of these. Kind of filling, but very tasty and satisfies my hop fix and then some. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is good. I can put a few down, but I need help with this keg. Anyone want to come over this weekend and lend a hand? All you can drink ;)"
"Dispicably drinkable."
"Overall, it is a great drink and it is a must during a hot summer night!"
"somewhat light bodied. kinda fit the flavor of the beer. pretty drinkable though.at 10.99 for a growler it's insanely hard to beat,but i don't think i'd buy a 4 pack."
"This is a complex beer. At 1st I thought it was a bit too sweet, but I came around to really appreciate the balance and complexities that make this beer an amazing brew. The aroma is a lot more subtle than I expected. Orange peel and spearmint. A little on the sweet side at 1st but then as it goes down the hops take control and the finish ends up bitter. This is a party for all areas of your tongue really. The flavors are very nice. I can't help but to think of mainly apricot, then grapefruit, tangerine and grassy garlic, with powdered sugar coating and alcohol warmth on a canvas of toasted malts. I don't know how to explain it except that I love this beer and will definitely buy it again."
"D-Nice IIPA. I think I'll have the other I bought and then buy a 6'r tomorrow for next weekend."
"I would easily drink this beer again. It quenched my thirst and my hop-desire substantially. It seems to be a nice hybrid between the ultra-citrusy/floral DIPAs and those of a more grassy or earthy nature. While it's not my favorite DIPA, it's definitely solid."
"Na Zdravje!"
"In terms of drinkability, if this were a bit lighter on the alcohol and still as strong on the bitterness, it would be very drinkable. However, I feel that the nice balance that Commodore has is lost in this, what seems like a souped up Commodore, IPA."
"Could this beer be a scaled up Commodore Perry? Very possibly so. However, the grassy/garlic/catty notes were not found in the former but are all present here."
"D: This is a deep, flavorful beer that begs to be explored. Definitely not my favorite DIPA, but very good nonetheless."
"This beer has an excellent mouthfeel, smooth, warming, and tasty, leaving the tongue tingling. If it weren't a monster in the alcohol content, I'd have another tonight! Another seasonal winner from Great Lakes."
"Overall, a very solid DIPA and definitely noticeable as the big brother of Commodore Perry. I liked it but was not blown away. Thought it was a solid offering that I would have again if readily available but probably won't go far out of the way to get it."
"World class DIPA, no slouch in comparison to many others out there, will be picking up several more 4 paks of this one before it disappears until next year! A great value at $9.99 / 4 pk! Nicely done, Great Lakes! Cool new label this year, with Bessie, the Lake Erie (Beer) Monster! Cleveland rocks!"
"Notes: This is really the epitome of a BeerAdvocate beer in that it delivers in all areas except for drinkability. What I mean is that I will enjoy one of these per day but only this one, in keeping with my motto of """Drink less, Drink better.""" Really though, this is one great beer!"
"This is very drinkable. I only wish I had it at home."
"D- Like I said before I could drink this year round and trough out the night, but being a 9.0 ac/vl you only need a few, but not to say that you could drink these trough out the evening because it is a perfect sipping beer which I have a major respect for, so thanks to one of the home town favorites for brewing such wonderful IPA."
"Pours a very nice mid copper color with some nice initial head and a bit of lacing. Excellent scent, a very grassy hop aroma with a wonderful deep malt backing. Huge flavor, a great huge thick deep malt sweetness with a wonderful hop profile: excellent grapefruit at the beginning turning into a bitter pine at the end, and lingering for a long time. Good mouth feel, deep and rich, with just a bit of roughness from the hops. Excellent DIPA."
"D: Just a delicious, well put together brew. Good balance, nice hop flavor without burning your tongue off with hops. Very enjoyable, and the alcohol is very well hidden. World class."
"D- that being said, the D for this monster is greatly increased by the mouthfeel alone. i've had better DIPAs as far as flavor content and balance are concerned, but this one may be the most intriguing. its like that girl that likes you until you start liking her then she flips the script. you say ahh dang that smells so great and feels so nice to drink but then pow you have this sticky resinous mess and the only remedy is another big sip and before you know it, the monster is gone, deep into the abyss of the belly. then, even though there is not one shred of evidence to the 9.1%abv, you just did the equivalent of shotgunning 2 budweisers, my friend, and the monster rises its serpentine head once more from the depths to bite you firmly on your drunken ass. thanks GLBC for finally making this one available."
"In a word, balance. A full mouthfeel, and a meal in itself. Enjoyed on tap at Pizza Plant Transit, post-extreme beer fest. Orange-Peachy colour, with lace sheets. Fruity aroma.Some pineapple flavours.Complex and thorough melange of hops, a bit much to drain to cup. Very fresh."
"Notes: If you are looking for a huge hop bomb then you will be surprised. This double I.P.A. is more malty, but still very refreshing. Nice switch from some of the other double I.P.A.s that are out there."
"This beer reminds me of Commodore Perry to a tee, the characteristics are identical, Lake Erie Monster is just more amped up. I personally would take Commodore Perry over this all day. This is a very solid beer, but I feel a little let down. I was expecting more. Not bad at all, I guess it just comes down to what you look for in a DIPA."
"for as big a beer as it is, its really goes down easy. i could definatly have a couple of these in a session, if it wasnt for the big ABV. this is a great new beer from a great brewery, get it if you can. goes to show the east coast has got it goin on too when it comes to big ipas."
"D. Good for a DIPA but I am not dying for another one. Nice effort here from GLB and happy to have tried this beer."
"Mmm...I can taste the aggression, but with a name like """Erie Monster", I wouldn't expect this IIPA to do anything BUT come looking for a fight. And it does, hitting the tastebuds with a resinous, piny wallop. Alcohol adds a hit of medicinal off-flavors to the back of the palate, and the malts struggle in vain to keep up with pale & caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is chewy, and a little syrupy, but nicely carbonated and smooth on the finish with a lingering presence of alpha acids and booze. I love how Great Lakes sticks to the traditional brewing practices, but still manages to hit it out of the park with beers like Erie Monster, Blackout Stout, and Nosferatu (among others). Chalk this up as another winner."
"On tap at the brew pub. Pours a golden orange with a thin white head, lots of lacing. Smell is bursting with hops and some type of fruitiness. Taste is of citrus hops, and I think melon. Very sweet, but not as much as some east coast IIPA's. Very drinkable as I finished my glass in just a few minutes."
"Appears a clouded orange bright bodied hue with a large foaming off white cream colored head layers huge with a nice biscuit clouded appearance. Leaves behind chunky sporadic lacing on the sides of my 4.95 pint glass. I like Vintage Estates in Boardman, OH. I couldn't even get a bottle of this down my way and they already had it on tap, nose consists of floral citrus candy coated hops, this stuff is excellent especially for Midwest, Great Lakes region DIPA. Flavor again sugar coated blast of hops I will definitely grab a bottle when I'm able to in order to compare the 2 versions. A touch of clean alcohol and hars bitterness from grapefruit like components but no other off flavors become unbearable throughout the whole drinking experience. Full bodied easy going carbonation body builds with layers of proteins from the malts and hops used here, nothing is offensive in a good way. Drinkability overall when of the best east coast/midwest DIPAs I've come across awesome experience I will find more of this beloved elixir."
"Overall, aromatic, juicy, fresh and full of flavor. Very drinkable, but beware the Monster's 9.1ABV. Sip and enjoy! Another winner from Great Lakes."
"Not overly sweet or bitter...never thought I'd find a """balanced""" DIPA which didn't skimp on ingredients. Dangerously drinkable, and charters new territory for the style. The best DIPA I've had since Pliny The Elder."
"Overall nice addition to the GLBC stable of brews. I find the hops in their Commodore Perry IPA more to my liking--grapefruit bitter. Could not determine the actual hops, but would guess not Simcoe or anything imparting much bitterness. Being close to the brewery I know this is a favorite of their employees and will be gone before too long."
"Another SUPER solid release from Great Lakes. I have yet to taste a bad beer from this outstanding brewer. This is a very welcome addition to my favorite style of beer and I hope I can get my fill in the limited time it is available."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thick, with a decent amount of carbonation. Not too crisp, but feels just about right. Fairly easy to drink, but being at such a high ABV makes it slightly harder. Even though the alcohol is hidden well, it can be slightly difficult to drink. Overall, a great brew, something I'll get as much as I can before it disappears."
"This beer also hurts in the drinkability from the sweetness and harsh bitterness. It is not something I could comfortably have a few of in a sitting."
"D: If you like massive hop bombs, this is for you. Looking for even a hint of balance? Stay away."
"Very drinkable. Great balance between the sweet and the hops. I prefer this over GLBC's Commodore Perry."
"This beer poured slightly cloudy light amber color and formed an off white foam head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, pine and grapefruit. A flavor of hops, pine, grapefruit/citrus and a hint of pepper. The body was medium light and the finish bittersweet with a touch of astringency. A nice beer, not the greatest double ipa, but still a good beer from a consistent brewer."
"This one is pretty good, still is nothing compared to a fresh Hopslam though."
"Expy date is 07/10/10. Less than 2 months away for a beer that's just now being released. IOW, it's fragile, a fleeting entry in the I2PA field. Elusive as the monster whose name it bears. Get it whist you can. You'll be happy you did."
"Overall drinkability is really quite high for a few reasons. It's tasty; it's ABV won't leave me unconscious after 2; and I have to give respect to GLBC for only using barley, hops, yeast, and water. No gimmicks, just beer. Cheers!"
"(D)- A solid to great DIPA. Has everything you would expect from the style. Not overly bitter, but actually almost creamy with the citrus & malt combo. I could have a few of these, but the 9.1%abv might cause to to stop at 2-3."
"D. This is a 9%? If this didn't go down hill so quickly or if it was available regularly, I could see it becoming a staple. As it is, I'll have to pick up another pack or two before Bessie goes back into hiding."
"Drinkability: I don't taste the alcohol at all (very well hidden) but I do notice it later into the glass, so a one beer an evening for me with this one. Went well with a meal but I can see myself slowly savoring this one as well. This (for me anyway) is a sipping beer - not for rapid drinking. Overall a very nice beer - glad I bought a 4 pack so I can enjoy more of this later."
"Lake Erie Monster has a wonderful aroma as well as a smooth crisp taste. This is the perfect balance of hops for a DIPA. You can actually taste them but they are not too pungent that it is undrinkable for my palette. This beer looks nothing special but it is definitely one of great lakes' best beers. The alcohol is hidden for sure and I think I'm in love with the picture on the bottle. The only bad part about this beer is that I can't stop drinking it and I will be sad when it is gone. I have already bought four 4-packs since thursday...oh well, this is for sure my drinking beer for a while."
"D - Decent drinkability, not much hint of the alcohol in the flavor at all, which is obviously pretty deceptive."
"Some hop aroma, but not what I'd expect from a DIPA. Not too promising. Some hops in the taste, but very muddied. I actually like the mouthfeel here, but this just doesn't bring the hops, which is the whole reason for a double IPA. Love Great Lakes, but this is a disappointing effort."
"Airy, cotton candy like mouthfeel feels off. Hard to describe, but this beer just seems out of sorts and incomplete. Overall, a bummer."
"Not a show stopper but a very nice IIPA from a brewery that does everything very well but nothing over the top. Pretty much what you'd expect from a brewery like Great Lakes. A solid offering but overshadowed by other giants in the same segment."
"M/D- The mouthfeel is smooth and oily; it goes down extremely easy. Drinkability is very high for a >9% beer. This is in the same ballpark as Hopslam or Dreadnaught but not quite as good as either. Still an excellent beer, but not the best Midwest IIPA."
"Feel is very smooth, medium to full, maybe could use a tad more carbonation. Good overall, however. Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV, which is hidden quite nicely. I will definitely try to get this when it's fresher because it seems to have a lot of potential."
"Still, a killer DIPA from a great brewery."
"D- If I were drinking this beer with food it would probably have to be something strong and/or spicy. It can be slightly powerful at times. The alcohol is apparent so Im taking this one slow."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 7/18/2010. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sweet, it's citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit, apricots) and pine hops, honey, and some sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma (but a bit stronger), it's sweet and fruity, and also has a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and a bit rich with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. The 9.1% ABV isn't very noticable at all in the aroma or taste. I think this is a good brew, I'll definitely buy this again."
"The first thing I noticed about the smell was vannila I've read reviews were guys are picking up all these crazy smells like ripe pomagranet or fresh berries and vannila, and I thought yeah whatever dude but I really did get nice whiffs of vannila on the pour. After the beer settled the smell was more of malty booze with a lite sweetness. Good lacing, and drinkability. This is a very well balanced Dipa, even if I do prefer a more hoppy double this is a serious beer that's well done."
"D - Starting with the aroma, this beer is unassuming. The monster just ROARS out of the water taking no prisoners thereafter. In an age of over-the-top, boozy, ripe DIPAs, this one is well-balanced and certainly holds it's own. Somewhat like the Erie, it's a tad shallow. It could use just a BIT more depth. Still a fantastic brew though!"
"The beer tastes citrusy but not strongly bitter, at least until the aftertaste causes a little pucker. Good oily and substantial body, like hops resin squeezed into a malt shake. Kind of addictive."
"Dense and thick, probably from all the bits floating around. All in all a very distinctive brew."
"D - This is really good, big flavor and very drinkable, Definitely check this out if you can!"
"D: Sip this beer slowly. As it comes to room temperature it gets more complex. A solid IPA, not the best but would buy it again."
"Unbelievable constancy by GLBC. This years batch is on par with previous years."
"D: Again, a little over the top in terms of sweetness to be something I'd really want to go after for a while, but not bad in any regard."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to someone who seeks a unique Imperial IPA with a distinct flavor profile in addition to hops."
"D-pretty solid taste that hides the alcohol relatively well make it quite enjoyable, the bitterness linger and the crisp finish would probably deter me from drinking multiple beers."
"SUMMARY: The Lake Erie Monster is a well constructed and unique DIPA. Another great beer from the folks at GLB. A must try."
"12 oz. glass at the brewpub"
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of white head. It is yellow/orange in color. It smells of grapefruit and orange. It tastes of grapefruit up front and finishes bitter. The flavor mellows as it warms. It is a lot more citrusy than most of the IPA's that I have sampled. It is quite refreshing."
"D-Hell yeah! Finally I get this brew on tap and it does not disappoint! Big, juicy hops up front with just enough malt to carry it through. This is one that every hop head should strive to get FRESH on tap!"
"Good beer, glad I had the chance to have it. Haven't been let down by anything they do yet."
"By the way, the new label is worlds better than the old one pictured here."
"This is an excellent DIPA and I was really surprised by the amount of balance in the taste. The light citrus hops are still the main draw here, but the balance is what makes this one for me."
"This is a Great Lakes classic. Perfect balance of hop flavors mingle with the interesting malt character to create and exceptional IPA. This should be in the Great Lakes regular rotation. Possibly as a summer seasonal 4-pack? A top notch IPA that NEEDS better distribution."
"HV"
"Poured a cloudy, yet pale amber color out of my fresh from the brewery bomber (also had some yeast floaties...always a good thing in my book.) White head about a finger thick that settles to a ring around the edge of the glass. Has the requesite citrus and pine hoppy goodness, but I also got a peach component. The sweetness was the first thing I noticed. Not a bad thing, just caught me off guard more than anything else. The sweetness quotient was higher than I'm typically fond of. Love the way everything comes together in the mouth...carbonation and consistency are superb. Hops is a bit relaxed compared to some other beers of this style. Alcohol also seems pretty noticeable. These things considered, I really dig this beer. I can't really explain it, but there are components to this beer that I've not been fond of in other beers. However, the total package is fantastic. Nice work Great Lakes!!! How about bottling this as a seasonal 4-pack?"
"D - I was happy with my third of a bottle - didn't really feel the need for much more of this one. It's a little too sweet and not hoppy enough for my liking."
"D: Highly drinkable for this isn't going to destroy your palate. And I personally like the flavor, but it isn't much to style. It definitely doesn't feel like a big beer or a 9% one."
"Eric"
"I really hope Great Lakes puts this one on the seasonal 4 pack release schedule. A very nice representation of the style. I often taste DIPAs that don't quite differentiate themselves from Barleywines enough, and vice versa with Barleywines."
"This is a well balanced brew, with none of the flavors too overpowering or extreme. The hops are definitely there with an assertive citrus flavor, but they are well balanced with the caramel sweetness of the malt. The alcohol is present though, warming on the way down. Overall, a satisfying and enjoyable DIPA, not overly sweet or too heavy like others."
"D: Damn drinkable for the style, I would like some more bitterness though."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. This monster appears a hazed bright apricot color with at least two fingers of dense off white foam. The head leaves behind a moderate lace in it's wake. Nose and flavor are full of sweet citrus notes such as orange peel, grapefruit juice, tangerines, nicely bitter hops, floral, and a big helping of caramelized malt to pull it all together. Bordering on full bodied and syrupy with ample carbonation. Great stuff."
"Overall very solid big IPA. Lots of well placed flavors and really smooth and very well done profile. I could drink this one again with ease."
"D- Very drinkable, I feel that this beer is not the standard Imperial IPA, due to its golden color, mouthful and back off bitterness."
"By far the best DIPA I have had hands down ."
"Cheers!!!"
"this was pretty much the perfect IIPA and went down way to easy"
"D- Easy to drink. I think I could drink this one all day long."
"The brutally bitter aspect of this brew, and the fact that I had to drive afterwards, make it hard to have more than one, but thats just me..."
"D: Pretty damn good. Good flavor and a pretty well balanced DIPA. I wouldn't mind drinking some more of this."
"Great brew."
"Overall, an awesome DIPA that I am so lucky to have been able to try. Luckily I had my father pick up a growler. If I would have waited two days longer to pick up a growler on my own, I would have never had the chance because it was taken off tap. Thanks dad for buying me a $40 growler!"
"drinkability is good the hops hides some of the alcohol and this beer seemed to go down nice and quick. Had to swithch to their regular IPA due to the fact I was driving."
"D - Drinkability is good. At over 9%, this goes down very easy. Still, one bomber is enough for me. The hop profile is really done well in this one (big fruit in the flavor = big smile on my face). Truly enjoyable and easily recommended if you can get it. Another great brew from Great Lakes."
"huge active bubbles turn rocky and reach two fingers of light tan that fades and leaves dots of lace. Body is a orange amber that almost glows when held to light. Nose is piney and musky with a hint of cleaning solution. Enters the mouth with some rustic piney hops and really does have that same windex like backround taste that was hinted by the nose. A tar like sweetness is there with a bit of creamy lime also. Citrus feel becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is on the juicy citrus based side with noticeable sweet residue. Nicely drinkable overall."
"Notes: Did i mention this is a juicy beer?"
"Pours a hazy reddish orange, thin white head, drops some spots of lace and settles itself to a thin ring. Smell is pine and caramel, grapefruity hops, pineapple, some tangerine, floral, very nice hops. Taste is awesome, caramelized malt, grapefruit, tangerine, sweet orange peel, wheat bread, spicy fruity bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation, alcohol warmth. I really dug the orange character in this one, nice DIPA. Thanks Russ!"
"D - pleasant, easy drinking brew."
"First, thanks to Kingpin for this bottle. Served from said bottle, this pours a hazy orange amber hue, with clumps of yeast suspended in the beer. The head is minimal and there is no lacing on the glass. The smell is mildly of hops. The taste is intensely hoppy with citrussy grapefruit and orange rind flavors predominating. There is an equally intense caramel or butterscotch malty flavor to provide some backbone and contrast to this wonderful beer. The mouthfeel is rich yet smooth. As I finished it, I sadly realized there was no more to be had(my brother had given me just the one bottle). This might be the best beer I've had from Great Lakes. I only wish they distributed to Minnesota. This is a fine DIPA and worth seeking if it's sold in your area."
"Pours a very nice cloudy golden orange color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots and lots of nice creamy sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, with some hops, nice tones of citrus/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty/hoppy, slightly sour, citrusy, and caramel. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Drinkable, this has a slight twist being a DIPA, but I like it."
"Pours a gorgeous cloudy orange with very nice looking and lasting head. Smell is citrusy hops and fruity sweetness. Taste is smooth, peach and sweet ruby red grapefruit like fruitiness from the hops and mild to moderate bitterness. Slightly acidic tasting and medium bodied with sweet grapefruit flavor in abundance. Definitely enjoyed this even more the 2nd time I had it. Great double IPA. Thanks again guys!"
"drinkability is great. very well balanced and super smooth. not quite as hop-dominated as some, but still great stuff."
"My notes repeatedly describe this as 'intense awesome'. I'm not sure which was more predominant, the 'intense' or the 'awesome', but I think it had enough of both to please any hophead."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to fiver29 & GrbDg for the bombers!"
"This is another fine beer from Great Lakes. For a DIPA, it could stand a little refining. From my perspective, it'd easily be improved by adding more hops. It just doesn't have the bitter, hop bomb kick that's common for beers of this style. Lake Erie Monster just comes across as a little too polite. But, it's still a very good and highly drinkable beer. Worth seeking out...if you can find a bottle."
"For hop lovers, this one is an indulgence, with a great balance of hop nose and full-hopped well constructed taste. Great bitterness and overall character. Drinkability is lowered by the abv and clinging fullness of the body, but I don't like it any less."
"Pours a rich, clear amber with some floating sediment. Bubbly off-white head fades quickly, leaving an oily layer and a thin ring, but nice sticky lacing. Smells of lemon rind, grapefruit, orange, pine, and caramel; great hop character. Tastes of grapefruit, orange and lemon rind up front with a good caramel, brown sugar, and biscuit backbone helping balance out the beer before a nice dry pine presence finishes out the beer with a little bit of alcohol warmth mixed in. Medium in body and low in carbonation, this is one great balanced DIPA that has substantial sweetness and bitter characteristics and hides its 9% alcohol very well, just giving you a little hint that it's there. Another great brew from Great Lakes, and another excellent IPA from the Midwest."
"Had the fortune to try this beer recently. Very good for the style The one thing that I was amazed with was just how fresh the beer tasted. Very crisp with an easy finish. The citrusy aroma of the hops was excellent as well. I did not find the aroma overwhelming which I think allowed for some pleasant surprises upon tasting."
"Wow! It's great to see another fantastic DIPA that's this tasty and drinkable coming out of the Midwest. I'd love to see them maybe one day get this in seasonal 4-packs for a better distribution and availability beyond the brewpub."
"poured a coppery and cloudy color. Nice thick off white head with a lot of lacing. Smell was really sweet with lots of citrusy hops. Some floral aroma as well with a strong malt presence. Taste is really sweet with a lot of bittering in the back. Mouth feel is very carbonated with a sticky feeling on the tongue that lingers."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium to heavy. Very easy drinking DIPA and I'm enjoying it immensely, am glad I drank this one as soon as I got it, very fresh."
"Pours a pretty dark foggy copper hue with a one finger off-white head that leaves a creamy layer of lacing on the sides. You can smell the sweetness from across the room, I love it. Big pink grapefruit and fresh tangerines up front on the nose. A light caramel malt aroma with a hint of evergreen as well. A very enjoyable beer to stick your nose into. Taste isn't as hoppy as the smell leads you to believe. Smokey caramel malt up front with subdued piney hops. Gritty earth flavors all the way through with this one. A zesty citrus hop sting towards the end that leaves a slick oily hop aftertaste. Fluffy light to medium body with a creamy texture. Carbonation is subtle, but fits this beer well. Alcohol is noticiable, but not too over the top. Very solid DIPA and another one from GLBC that doesn't disappoint. If you live in the Cleveland area, defintely give this one a shot."
"D: 9.2% is pretty deceiving. Drinks very easily for a DIPA, especially because of the tongue friendly bitterness level. I'll easily finish this growler tonight. I'm sure it'll go great with the cajun rubbed smoked tenderloin that's for dinner :)"
"The body is big for style. There is a nice malt presence for body but I wonder if this would have been better if it was toned down a bit to let the hops come out. Overall good but is more east code hop for me."
"D: I'll stick with the Commodore Perry, thanks."
"Good body, and carbonation. One of the only beers I have had from GLBC where the alcohol is noticable. Pretty nice, but the sweetness lingers too long for me."
"Bottle courtesy of SS: Poured a deep copper color ale with a big foamy head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of yellow grapefruit, floral and bitter hops is quite sublime and well balance for a style that does produce quite a lot of unbalanced beers. Taste is dominated by the yellow grapefruit characteristics of the hops with some floral malt notes and a bitter finish. Body is quite full with some great carbonation and no alcohol could be detected. Very well done for the style and something I wish I could have access to more often."
"Mouthful was nice and smooth and it's very drinkable for a fairly high alcohol beer, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. This is one of my first Great Lakes beers and while it is obviously well-made and tasty, it isn't quite what I look for in a DIPA."
"Creamy, medium body. Dry, bitter aftertaste. Could use some more carbonation. Not difficult to drink and the abv isn't noticed in the flavor or mouthfeel. I am glad to have tried it, but I think I would pass this one up if I was looking for a hop fix."
"D: At first taste, I really din't know what to think about his brew. The second sip won me over! It's a winner. It is puckeringly sweet and easy to consume for a DIPA that weighs in at 9.00%. I will be aging my remaining bottles in the hopes that this brew mellows with time. Recommended.!"
"It's good but it is slightly too sweet. However it does have a very generous amount of hops. Very fruity and resiny on the finish. Fruits are tropical and stone. Led by peach, papaya, and grapefruit. Somewhat cloying in sweetness. Just too much caramel. Mouth is somewhat thin also. Oddly enough drinkability is high as this still is a damn good beer. It just seems overly discombobulated."
"I was disappointed in this beer and it is nowhere near the same class as Dreadnaught or Pliny The Elder. Sample at the pub but do NOT buy a growler of this before you taste it. 12 Oz glass due to the alcohol level."
"Pours a dull brownish orange with a hazy clarity. Creamy two and a half finger head showing excellent retention and plenty of sticky patches of lace. Magnificent cascade citrus nose, a mild chinook grapefruit rind aroma, and some faint crystal. Sweet pale malt and crystal upfront, with loads of fresh grassy/fruity american hop flavor that carries over into the aftertaste. Moderate carbonation imparts a mellow crispness that pairs nicely with the fuller body and resinous hop bitterness. The alcohol is hidden enough to score a high drinkability. Finishes oily but not at all slick, and very well balanced for a DIPA."
"D :: Superb for 9 percent, this beer hides it better than most. The lighter, yet rich body is perfect for many occaisions. Cheers! This is one dang good beer."
"Served up in a GL stemmed glass at Oktoberfest. Nice appearance at a cloudy light peach with a thin but lasting white head. Hues lean toward orange. Very citric aroma and flavor but definitely under wraps a bit. Caramel shown through the hops. Not for hardcore hop heads. Sweetish, sugary flavor on top of the orangey hops. Juicy and sweet mouthfeel with a relatively bitter finish. Drinkability is really too high for this style. Basically, I liked this beer a ton but it certainly wasnt what I expected. The hops were one dimensional (huge citrus fruit) and the sugars were so high as to make the beer almost fruity as opposed to IPA like. Bitterness was present to be sure but it wasnt at the level of an average IPA let alone a DIPA. Conclusion, great beer but dont expect your typical Extreme DIPA. Perhaps these brewers should be commended for showing restraint in a time of giant beers."
"Finally had a chance to have this beer and it lived up to the hype. Though I was a bit suprised in the color that it poured. I found it to be a little lighter in color than most of the DIPAs I have had. The hop smell is definately coming through and prepared me for a huge rush of hop taste. The beer is well balanced though- the Hops are not to overpowering. My gf, who normally would pass on even an IPA, thought the beer was OK. It's definately a sipper though with the 9% ABV. Try some with the Brad Pudding- they go great together!"
"Golden in color and completely clouded. Fine bubbled head and a very fruity nose. Lacing was exceptional, nearly coating my glass. Spicy and fruity from the first sip. Lemon and citrus notes are abound. Great hop strength without overpowering its other characteristics. Honey like sweetness, nicely balanced. Medium to thick body and very nice mouth coating all around. Spiciness lingers in the finish. Very consistent to the end. This beer isn't trying to be the fancy pants, but for what is has been done well."
"growler is about 40 dollars from the great lakes brewery; but worth every penny. is about 70 ounces of IPA. lots of hops and great flavor. definitely worth a try. either at the brewery or through a growler. talked with bartender, they said they weren't able to bottle it yet."
"D - Not a session beer due to the high ABV. But i'm a hop head so I love it."
"Except for the buzz this beer is very drinkable. I wish it was sold in bottles because I really don't need to be 40 minutes from home while drinking it."
"Cask version at Barleys 3rd Annual Mini RAF (04/16/05): Pours a murky orange color with a thin off-white head. Thin lacing too. Nice hoppy and citrusy aroma. Medium-bodied and very smooth with a subtle but persistent hops flavor. This reminded me very much of the DFH 90 Minute on tap, which is definitely a good thing. There are also some citrus and pine flavors. The finish is slick and rather bitter. All in all this was a great way to kick off the event, an Imperial IPA as good as I knew GLBC could do it."
"Highly recommended."
"It's certainly a drinkable brew, and I was disappointed to read it was only available in the pub. I'd love to be able to pick up a six pack at the beer store. It may be time to invest in a growler."
"Sampled from a 10 oz glass at the brewery. Being a lover of the hop - I was, of course, elated to hear that the special tap brew the evening I rolled into town was a Double IPA. At 9.5% abv, it was served in a smaller glass than the other brews, but was filled to the brim & had a very small perfectly white creamy head. It was a deep copper & the head had completely disappeared within about a minute. After about 15 minutes it had warmed to a perfect temperature for enjoyment. Loads of oily, piney hops with way more than a hint of caramel malt in the background. This brew coats the mouth beautifully with a relatively thick syrup-like fullness. Undertones of caramel & molasses are overshadowed quickly & permanently by generous doses of complex hopping. Hop profile has a little bit of everything - they are floral, earthy, citrusy, & piney. Wonderful balance between hop bitterness & sweet malt make this a delightfully easy to drink, well-crafted treat."
"Drinkability  Big and smooth with a nice, satisfying dry finish. Whats not to like?"
