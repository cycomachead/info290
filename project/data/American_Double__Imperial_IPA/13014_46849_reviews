"Disappointing, didn't see the hype"
""
"The saltiest IPA I've ever had. Delicious though!"
""
""
"Pine and honey, accompanied by a subtle metallic hint, resulting from the carbonation, interact incredible well with the tongue numbing citrus bitterness, tranforming the taste more and more into a tropical fruit direction, due to the distinct, honeyed malts infusion. This beer is truly abrasive, while it highlights all the positive characteristics of a well composed IIPA. Its versatile in taste, while it provides a merciless bitterness, wrapped up by citraic fruits and honeyed malts."

"Super hoppy but not bitter DIIPA, loved it."

"Hands down. The best beer I have ever had! Only a seasonal beer, but best beer in the world!"

"Overall:   A great example of making an intense DIPA that still offers a lot of balance for experienced hop heads.  Always impressive to have this much hop flavor without an overly sticky finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can. Murky orangish - yellow pour with a white head. Citrusy hop aromas. Tasty with citrus and topical fruit hop notes. A sturdy caramel malt backbone which keeps things in check. Above average body and mouthfeel. A solid DIPA that lives up to the hype."
"This was a bit of a disappointment for me it was good dont get me wrong but it just wasnt what it could be."
""
""
""

"It smells and tastes like B.O."
""
"This is supposedly a Double, but is NOT boozy at all. Probably the most drinkable Double IPA on the planet. Fantastic, must try beer."
"O: One of my favorite DIPAs, right up there with Bodhi and Hopslam and maybe only slightly lagging behind Permanent Funeral. A fantastic nose, an intense flavor profile, and a wonderful mouthfeel make for a great beer-drinking experience. Holds up well, too: had about 12 of these over the last month and there's only a very minor issue with the hops falling off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer, would love a four pack for the fridge to finish a day off with.  I think this would have been even better if I didn't have Heady and Pliny the day before.  Still a beer I'll be seeking."

"Pours a bright orange amber that is LOADED with floating sediment. Smell is a bright floral citrus, tropical fruit, apricot, grape fruit, with notes of caramel. Beautiful citrus hop forward flavor with notes of tangerine, balanced nicely with subtle sweet malt, finished with a mild grape fruit bitterness. One of the most flavorful DIPAs I've ever had. Clean and bright, yet doesn't miss a beat with such intense flavors. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had! A real treat from Surly that is a must have"
""
""
"Overall, a top notch DIPA with a powerful, yet inviting hops character, nicely balanced with well hidden alcohol. Brilliant!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a big DIPA. I'm really surprise how well it held up being 8 weeks from canning date. Will seek out next year for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've blind tasted Abrasive with many of the other top rated IPAs and so far Abrasive has come away as the best each time. Great look, great taste, and amazing aroma definitely make it a world class beer that you must try!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Reminds me a lot of 077xxx, with a little extra bitterness on the finish. Must have for any hop head"
""
""
""
""
"Abrasive's an impressive DIPA, and an interesting one given the beers it compares to (would immediately call up the less-regarded, but similarly excellent Golden Road Wolf Among Weeds). Great, bitter finish with an excellent hop aroma that intoxicates with every sip. Highly recommended if you can find/trade for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Canned 2/6.  Extremely bitter. Definitely heavy on the hops a month after canning."
""
""
""
""
"A great bitter IPA. Taste good and refreshing and just like a hop head likes. But that aroma. That's what puts it over the top into great territory."
""
""
"Def a top 5 for me."

"My general impression (yes, I do impressions) is that this could be more balanced. It is kind of all over the place. I do really like the flavors, but it is such a palate wrecker, it almost makes it a little harder to enjoy. It is one of those beers that I want more of while I am drinking it, but regret it later. Still a great beer that doesn't fall short of it's namesake in any way. Hopheads take note."
""
"Overall: A delicious DIPA. Too bad not available in NYC."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can pour from a 2/6/15 canning. This is a big DIPA! Certainly lives up to its' name. Plenty of bitterness on the palate along with those deep hoppy citrus notes. A little floral on the back end but really the overall feel I have here is the bitter hops sitting alongside a pretty robust malt profile. Splendid stuff."

"Everything about Abrasive is what beer should be. It is the perfect cold MN winter day beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had from a very fresh keg.  Fuller bodied than most of others of the style.  A great winter DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O.  An outstanding IIPA.  Some nice citrus and a balanced amount of bitterness to offset it nicely.  Very good body and carbonation for a IIPA. They did a good job with this beer."
""
""
"Best smelling beer I've ever had. Super smooth and great tasting. A personal favorite. Wish it was more readily available."
""
"I now have a new favorite DIPA. This one is definitely a destroyer of palates, but the flavors are phenomenal."
""
""
""
"Finally sitting down to drink the long awaited Abrasive ale. And it is delicious ! Glad I finally got to try this long time want of mine. Pretty much lives up to it's hype. Finishes with a funky onion and garlic taste at the end which brings it down ever so slightly. Awesome !"
"Hop heaven!  Surly does it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a big beer with a tremendous nose of dank herbal hops, pineapples, grapefruit and tangerines. It translates to flavor but it ends with garlic and onions on my palate and I just can't rate it that high."
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommendation: Not worth giving up an arm or a leg for, but if you can easily snag one, I'd jump on it."
""
""
"This beer is epic...  Right up there with Heady... Fantastic"
""

"Cans arrived today thanks to an extremely generous BA. Thanks man! Can dated 1/13/15 poured to a tulip glass deep copper colored with nearly no head. Aroma is straight up malt, no hop presence whatsoever. Straight up caramel sugar. Flavor follows with no hop presence, straight malt syrup, almost like this has been sitting around for a few years. Wow. Thick and syrupy, lower carbonation. Really horrendous. Maybe if this were called a barleywine, I'd give it a few more points. But wow. This is Abrasive?"
""
""
""
""
"O- this one lived up to the hype, a hop explosion that is completed nicely with a thick any creamy, oat filled body.  Worth the wait"
""
""
""
""
"4 week old can poured into a ping glass. Much sweeter and thicker mouthfeel than I expected. Overall very good."
""
""
""
""

"Perfect!  Rolling warmth across my tongue.  Hops Galore!  I wish I could drink this every time I want an IPA."

"All i have to say for this beer is that it is an exceptional ipa, and if i could get it all the time i would, but i cant, so i'll enjoy this experience then be back to ny Molotov Lite."
"I've not tasted a double IPA that balances the extreme hop bitterness like this one. It has a lot more bite than hopslam, but it doesn't let the bitter bite dominate the rest of the beer. Citrus and stone fruit shine through gloriously in the aroma and the taste. That balance alone would make a great IPA, but there is an earthy quality as well. One reviewer described it as herbal. It works wonderfully adding flavor and complexity to an already great beer. Best IPA I have tasted yet."

"Not sure if I can add anything to the many reviews other than confirm that this is one excellent beer. So juicy, with a sweetness to balance the bitterness."
""
"Overall, what a fantastic beer to start your night with.  Actually, we started and ended our night with pours of Abrasive at the new Surly brewpub (which is gorgeous, by the way).  This was actually kind of an emotional experience for us.  We had visited Minneapolis a few weeks prior to this trip, but unfortunately were unable to get over to Surly.  Very sad.  We happened to get a chance for a second trip to Minneapolis for work, and were so thankful for the opportunity to make time during this return visit.  If we’re not mistaken, the day we arrived at the brewpub was their annual release day for Abrasive; a beer that has been ever elusive for us, at least for the past few years.  It was such a nice surprise to see it one tap, and we had to go for it.  Thus, the two glasses a piece.  What a journey the beer itself is.  The nose is sweet and warming simultaneously, making that first sip irresistible joy.  It shocks you with intense citric and grapefruit bitterness, then the sweetness hits.  Finally, the booze and chemicals wash you away for this amazingly balanced finale.  This is the best DIPA we’ve had in recent memory, and it is sips uniquely as a true east/west hybrid on the transition from the front of the mouth to the back.  We said it once, and we’ll say it again…BOOM."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Besides being overly bitter for my poor taste buds, this is a damn good brew. The more masochistic of IPA/DIPA drinkers would probably love this."
""
""
"Wow this beer blew me away.  Had it at a bottle share with some other outstanding IPA's (2nd Fiddle, Pliny, Gandhi Bot) and this was the (surprising) clear winner.  If you handed me this beer I would incorrectly guess it was another dank VT beer.  Goes to show that you don't need to be in VT to brew fantastic DIPAs with that signature smell and taste I look for.  Well Done!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know I'm not the only one to get a flat abrasive, 2 were great and 2 were very low carb.  This review is for the flat ones, I just believe this beer shouldn't be rated this high when there is the possibility of tainted cans.  The good is really good, but the bad is pretty bad.  Surly really needs to take QC seriously."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-a perfect DIPA. superb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Canned 7 days ago acquired via trade. Golden orange color with a thin head. Great citrus nose and enticing smell. Drinks good and sticky as expected, balanced piny bitterness. Good malt backbone here helps round out a very good beer. I like Cycle Crank slightly better, but this one is a winner. Would gladly enjoy more."
""
"A lot of people stating this years batch was flat.  Mine was not and it is great!"

"A citra hop masterpiece- fantastic"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  This is an excellent DIPA and quite deserving of its rank."
""
"Despite the blast of Citra on the front end with tropical warmth in this winter release, I think the fresh, long ending and aftertaste are my favorite elements in the brew. It’s lively and large, but could use a touch more barley to ground and integrate its bitter angles and splashy fruits. Food fills that need quite nicely, though. The appellation doesn’t really fit this iteration of Abrasive, but buy it up and drink deeply! It’s a winner…again."
""
""
"O- From the moment I cracked the can and the tropical smell hit me in the face I knew I would love this beer. It is the most concentrated expression of Citra hops that I have had yet and really one of those beers you just want to sit and smell and it almost pains you to have to drink it cause it will be gone. It's right up there with Heady for me as one  of the best DIPAs and a beer I will certainly trade for every year now."
"Tried this again more sober, and a fresher beer. While I still find the bitterness to be a bit astringent and overwhelming, the pine, resin, and citrus are intriguing. Still put off by onion in aroma, but far better than initially rated."
""
""
""
"Hoppy and smooth. Great nose,  too!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is fantastic. It's got a lot of juicy hops but it's got the malt to bring the hops up short on the end. Find this beer."
""
""
"My cans were part of the under-carbed bunch. 1/13/15 bottling date. Still tasted absolutely delicious! Awesome, awesome, awesome beer! As a lucky winner of the most recent Kern River Brewing """Citra Lottery", I look forward to doing a side by side with each of them next week. Shout out to Josh012012 for sending this my way, CHEERS!"

""

""

""
""
"Overall:  superb beer."
""
"Nice rich orange color with pillow of white foam. Smells hops, oats, citrus fields. Taste is a rush of mouthwatering citrus as it fades a nice bitterness builds in the back of your throat. Mouthfeel also leaves  the sticky, sugary coating of citrus."

"My favorite DIPA of all time. Nuff said. It still has been for years."
""
""
""
""
"Holy cloudiness. Looks like there is a lot of suspended yeast in the body. Excellent malty hop aroma. Pretty tasty. Very thick mouthfeel. Lots of hop flavors. Citrus lemony taste is strong. Some malt taste comes through, but I get more sweetness from the aroma than the taste."
""
""
""
"One of my personal favorites."
""
""
"Pours golden, hazy. Color is lighter than you would expect for a beer in this style range. Excellent, complex nose, notes of citrus, pine and floral. This is quite an exceptional beer, better balanced and significantly more enjoyable than furious. One of my favorites from Surly, always brings me back to when I first had this beer years ago."

"Poured a thick, hazy orange. Very attractive, with a long lingering head and good lacing qualities. A big nose of citrus, pineapple, grapefruit. The taste mirrors the nose with big fruit and pine, and little malt notes. Just how I like them. Great carbonation and a nice drinkable feel. Very we'll done."

"O - Aside from the fact the can looks like more like an energy drink than a world class beer, this brew is top-notch. My friends and I did a blind taste test of Abrasive versus Heady Topper and fully expected the Alchemist's DIPA to win - even though the HT was an admittedly 2 months old. Abrasive wiped the floor. Worth a visit to Minnesota just for this brew!"

"Aother stellar beer from the folks at Surly! Any IPA fan would be silly to not add this to their must-have list."
""
"I don't know how a beer could be any better than this--citrusy odor and tangy mouthfeel. I just love to have it sit on my tastebuds for a while before I swallow it. There are some issues with the way it looks recently--some flock, but who cares when a beer tastes this good. Beautiful head. Amazing beer."

"Wow. Very good. 9% ABV is not evident at all. Very juicy and bitter… I could drink this again and again… in fact, number 2 is being opened right now. Best Double IPA I’ve had. Very refreshing and drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I don't compare a lot of beers to Stone Ruination, but this one deserves it. It is simply a very well done, intentionally bitter beer for people who love hops...and I love hops, so thanks Surly."
"On tap in the Surly taproom. Slightly hazy, dark orange color. Aromas of tropical citrus fruits, grapefruit, and a touch of pine. Taste was bitter, but not overwhelming and quite pleasant. Lighter citrusy hops really come through and blend well with the malt backbone."

"Pours a nice golden color with a white head. Very sweet, fruity aromas with a lot of hops. The flavor is beautifully complex, with dry hop notes, sweet citrus, a nice light tartness and plenty more. A very well-balanced IPA, with just about everything going for it. Couldn't imagine it better."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would classify this as a grapefruit IPA, I prefer piney IPAs, but in the end, this one still wins at the end of the day, if there is an elite example of the style, this is it."

"O - not as good as I remember, but still delicious. The big tropical hop notes were less familiar to me then, which probably elevated the experience. Those flavors are definitely more commonplace in IPAs and DIPAs lately, so I guess that makes this one less unique. Really nice to come back to it after all these years, especially seeing as Surly is one of my favorite breweries."

"Overall you can tell this is a top notch beer and I think I am going to have a higher rating for this beer in the future."
"Pours a very hazy light amber color. Lots of sediment floating around in there. Smell is delicious even if it is an aged can. Lots of citrus, grapefruit rind, tons of hoppiness. Taste is just as good, but also has a malty sweetness to it that is very well balanced. Great DIPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn good DIPA precisely because it doesn't over-reach itself - Surly is all about hops, but even more so, I have yet to have a single beer of theirs that isn't expertly well-balanced. I'm fascinated by the contrast between how basic and occasionally unexciting the core flavor is, compared to the explosive rainbow of scents and flavors that stay in your mouth long after you've swallowed it."

"Surly Abrasive falls under the category of beers that need to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Words cannot even begin to explain the pleasure of drinking such a vibrantly hoppy and balanced DIPA. This is unbelievably approachable and quaffable for a beer with its specs (9%, 120 IBU). It's a DIPA that eclipses even many of my previous favourites. Simply great stuff."

"A very good double IPA. I would drink this again anytime. The flavor and aroma are powerful and juicy, and it hits the perfect mark that people are generally looking for in a DIPA/IPA. The alcohol is under control, and the hops are fully featured here. Is it better than Heady Topper? (My buddy prefers this to HT...) I'm not convinced. Give me a couple more cans and I'll find out."

"My palate tends toward the sweeter - to me, the Platonic ideal of the double IPA is Hopslam. This is not Hopslam - it is nice, balanced, and refreshing, but it retains more bitterness at the finish."

"A totally delicious and crushable DIPA! Yet another jewel in the Surly crown. It is a must purchase anytime in see it in a store or on-tap. I recommend you do the same."
""
""
"Lordy this smells good. Fills the room with aroma. This beer is clear, contrary to the previous review. I'd call it prettier, but lacking a bit in head. It's delicious."

"Mouthfeel is incredible. I've never had an ipa like this before. There so much hop oils and resin that my tounge instantly goes numb on contact. But sticky mouth coating oils and resin let the hop flavors and aroma dominate the entirety of the beer. Moderate carbonation and a light body help soften the aggressive hops and it ends up being pretty well balanced."

"O - Very similar to Lagunitas Sucks in my opinion. Only with stronger flavors. Really a great beer that I could easily kill a 4 pack of. Thank you to GreatGazoo for the trade."
""
""
"**edit. Had this a handful of times since original review. I am upgrading the ratings as it has certainly been more consistently better than the first time I reviewed. Aroma is more more potent, and flavor, and at a couple months plus from canning, is still bursting with flavor."
""
""
"Overall a fantastic IIPA. First time I've tried this - got lucky with the last 4 pack from Binnys. Given the price point (18 for 4 pints) its not something I'd pick up regularly (not like I could anyway) but prob something I'd try to pick up at least once a year. For IIPAs I'd put this in my top 5 for sure"
""
"Unreal! This is the end of my 4pk and each can has gotten better and better. Huge dank aroma of very crisp-pine-clean grapefruit, dank astringency, mango, peach and a soft caramel malt backbone. Touch sweet strawberry juice as well. Taste is very dry but an explosion of grapefruit, fresh orange, and tropical fruits but not overly juice or juice-like, which is great. Incredibly clean, smooth, balanced. One of the best I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, hands down one of the best DIPAs I've had to date, not sure if it's worth dropping $20 a 4 pack here in Chicago though, but worth trying if available."
""
"This is a tremendously tremendous ale---bar none! This is high powered octane to get drunk quick. The pricing on this will always be in question for me. Like Sculpin, which is fantastic in its own right, I was curious of the hype but can't see paying the higher cost associated and I have not bought any since then and tis a shame. A lot of fantastic ales competing out here, no doubt. ABV on Abrasive is substantiate to get you going well on any pre-flight for the night. Sad to say that @ apx 20$/4pk, I just can't pull the trigger in the future. My curiosity has been quenched as I had an extra 20 in my pocket yesterday. Really though, not to be missed in your lifetime if you love quality and a good buzz on. Tremendously tremendous!!!"

"Overall: I really like this beer, Surly did a very good job. I do however prefer there Furious a little bit more because of the availability and drinkabilty. (but it's not a DIPA) I look forward to drinking this when it's available."

"O - A really good beer, however I didn't like this as much as other BA 100 rated IIPA's. Also, not sure if I can see this being that much better than Surly's Furious APA, which is about $8 less per 4 pack. Was it really good, yes. Will I drink it again, certainly. Would I rate it as high as Pliny or Zombie, definitely not. Surly delivers many fine beers and intrigues me along the way. I will continue to try whatever they offer. -Prost!"
"O: One of the top 5 DIPAs out there. Loads of fresh citrus hop flavor, but there are enough things going on to keep it from getting boring."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a lightly foamy (1/5) mouthfeel that is otherwise smooth, appropriate for a fairly ethanol-filled, strongly-flavored double IPA. Ethanol is only lightly detectable as gentle heat in the nostrils, no burnging on the palate or throat. Closes dry, with medium-heavy stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
"This beer is consistently fantastic. The pour is a hazy honey orange with an off white head that fades to subtle lacing and carbonation throughout. Wow the smell bright orange grapefruit citrus with a dank balance and a slight peachy yeast aroma. The taste hits all the aromas perfectly balanced not overly sweet bitter or citrus but does lean toward the citrus side. The taste is near perfect but I do think Pliny and ht are slightly deeper and fuller. The mouthfeel is crisp and full and you want to keep going back to the well for another. Overall a top IPA"

"Overall: Without a doubt one of the best IPAs I've ever had. I would only say its true rival that I've had to this point is HT. The floral hop tones are literally perfect and everything I love about an IPA. The malt body provides a perfect base for the hops to shine and dominate this brew. All I have is wow, a masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer, it is my #1 beer right now. If you have a chance to try it and you like IPAs you have to pick it up. I have had it side by side with Bell's Hop slam (which is also a great beer) and would take Abrasive over it every time. It just sucks it is only available for a few months a year."

"Really nice looking beer, dark orange color with a half finger head and minimal lace. Aroma is a little muted for me. I get some orange, piney hops. I find it somewhere in between a citrus and pine bomb. Taste is fruity and tasty upfront with some malt and pine in between and then a huge hop bomb aftertaste and pretty dry. I also get a little candyish pez type taste. Almost reminds me of Palate Wrecker but with more fruit characteristics. Mouthfeel is semi carbonated and bitter rolling off the palate. Overall this is an excellent DIPA but not quite World Class in my opinion. As it warms it really shines. I would definitely seek this out and love to try one that's fresh as hell to better compare. Even so, another great one from Surly."

"About as close to perfect a DIPA has humanly possible. Super fresh tasting, resiny hop flavors. I buy this one whenever it's available, wallet permitting. The standard against which all DIPAs should be judged - unfortunate that it's not a year-round beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a perfect hop bomb orange. Nice white head that settled quickly but it did leave some nice lacing. Smell was awesome. Nice and fruity with a kick of pine. Taste was that of a top notch DIPA. The citrus followed by the pine notes where amazing. Mouthfeel left you waiting for the next sip. Overall a great beer. Abrasive is a fantastic DIPA."

""
""
""

"This is not like Surly's Furious IPA whatsoever. The aroma is heaven, with mangoes and peaches abound. Big citrus notes and slight pine on the taste with a medium carbonation and a nice lingering bitter finish. One of the best DIPA on this side of life. Enjoy it."

""
""

"I don't quite get the comparisons I'm reading to Surly Furious. This is a very different beer, and even more hoppy. It's right up there with the Stone Enjoy By Series as one of my favorite IIPAs. Fantastic taste. I would highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
"O/D-This lived up to the hype for me. It's hop expression is just to my liking. I will be looking for more of this next time its brewed. An elite, top tier beer. It gets better as it warms."
""
""
""
""
"O) I've got some grievances to voice here. 1) Surly should send their beer to Wisconsin pronto. 2) This should be available year round."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Killer DIPA. The aroma is unreal. Taste is not quite as amazing as the aroma, but provides a nice complement of slightly different flavors than seem present in the aroma."
""
"Judgement - Absolutely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an amped up, and higher quality, double version of Furious I think. The citrus/pineapple flavor in the scent/taste is somewhat unique and interesting."
""
"Honestly, I had some trepidation about this one at first perhaps just because of the name. But it isn't abrasive at all. It's just Furious on steroids....but still delicious. Not a total one sided hop bomb at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - I'm a huge a fan of this beer and being from MN, I'm fortunate enough to have easy access to this. Just wish Surly would make available it year round."

"A classic IIPA, and deservedly so. I've had Surly Furious, and wasn't that impressed with it (who knows - perhaps I just had a bad can), but this one is definitely a keeper. Very pleasant, intense hop flavors, but not so bitter as to detract from the drinking enjoyment. Terrific IIPA."
""
""
""
"Wow. Very good. 9% ABV is not evident at all. Very juicy and bitter… I could drink this again and again… in fact, number 2 is being opened right now. Best Double IPA I’ve had. Very refreshing and drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Thanks to Pintofbrown for sending this in his beer swap. Hands down, the best DIPA I've had. Very well made and balanced."

""

"O: This is a great hoppy beer, truly juicy with citrusy hop character. Abrasive really showcases its hops wonderfully, giving room for pine, grapefruit, and other tropical fruit character to step up over an appropriate but not overwhelming malt backbone. Maybe slightly more bittering on the finish than I would like, but definitely not overdone. Really a solid beer that I'd be happy to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet Jesus, how do the guys at Surly make hoppy beers of this caliber? This feels so much like a West Coast IPA or a Midwestern hoppy variety in so many respects, but it blows most offerings in the country out of the water. Refreshing, complex, food friendly, and rewarding stuff. At the low price and decent availability, I wonder if I should just stick to getting more of these from now on than any other beer of its type not in my distro. I really wish this were year-round. World class."
""
""
""
"O- The best DIPA I've had by far (yet to try pliny or heady though) I wish this beer was cheaper at $15.99 a 4 pk 16oz cans but I am very glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a snifter - bright golden-orange body, beige film. Heavy on the citrus - nice bright notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon. Peach and guava tropical notes - very juicy and hop-forward. Reminded me very much of Hop Venom - very nice stuff"
""
""
"Have now had roughly 12 cans of this and definitely want more."
""
"Pours out a slightly dark orange with a two finger white head that dissipates fairly slowly with some nice lacing. Smell is definitely nice and fruity -- grapefruit, orange, and a little pineapple is what I am getting from the nose. Smells really nice. Taste some nice malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer with tastes much like the nose. I'm surprised when I'm thinking critically about the beer that I am getting the malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer but there is a really nice balance with the malts I really never noticed before for this IIPA. I don't want to overstate the malts. really not balanced but there are some in the background that are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is thicker than most IIPAs but this really makes it a treat. Overall this is a great beer that I always look forward to and was really happy it came early this year."

"This a great IPA. I really think surly puts out great beers. I would drink this IPA right away. It losses the hops quick. There is a great nose on this beer. It is 16 ounces of awesome. Great flavor. Good mouthfeel for an IPA. Not as much citrus as some of the other IPAs out there but it is outstanding."
""
"Pours a nice golden copper hue with a frothy one white head. Decent lacing. Smell is very resinous with lots of tropical citrus. Taste has lots of juicy citrus and a nice amount of piney resinous. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Overall a great DIPA."

""
""
""
""
""
"Incredible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly amber golden body with big foamy white head when poured into a glass. The nose jumps out with bold tropical fruits. Pineapple specifically. Some mango. The front end is very fruity while the back end is a dank, bitter finish. Very full flavored DIPA. Much better poured into the glass than from the can. A world class DIPA that has something for everyone from fruitiness to bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the best I've ever had without a doubt; a hop-head's holy grail. Seek this one out, I know I will be in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to doner24 for the trade. Pours a deep golden color with a thick, quickly dissipating white head. Very nice lacing. The aroma on this beer is outstanding - tropical fruit, citrus, cantaloupe, resinous pine, lemon, with a hint of breadiness. Bitterness throughout with faint caramel notes mid palate that finishes very dry with a touch of honeyed sweetness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is oily, with a medium-light body and decent carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted DIPA that sits among the pantheon of the finest DIPAs."
"*EDIT*: After consuming, this can left me seriously craving another, which I allowed myself, and drank straight from the can. This seems important - upon imbibing of second pint, I was left feeling that there was too much fruitiness going on with this beer. I don't take back any praise, this is an awesome IPA, but part of me thinks I'm becoming more of a stout guy."

"Had this on cask at 3Floyds in early/mid 2013. Fantastic DIPA anyway, cask puts it over the edge. Bubbly/soapy two finger white head, beer was hazy dark straw color. Great nose of hops but also mellowed as all cask beers are. Phenomenal flavor, still hoppy and balanced by malt, but smoothed over by the cask. Mouth feel was very similar to taste. A rare treat."

"Definitely my favorite beer. Similar taste to Hopslam minus the rich honey/citrus. This one kicks you in the mouth with the amount of Hops. Slightly bitter when you first taste it but a very smooth finish. Recommend trying this one in-season, as it seems to go stale fairly quickly."
""
""
""
"Overall: Awesome DIPA. I was not a fan of other Surly offerings, but this one really earns it's reputation. I am looking forward to getting more of it next year!"
""
"O - Great beer, leaves me wanting to try all the other Surly brews! This is a DIPA that I could have multiples of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the perfect example of what a DIPA should be. Mouthfeel isn't too light, hops take center stage, great resinous aftertaste. Great great great all around. If I could get this in Vegas, I would stock up a healthy suply. But I can't, so a huge thanks to jeremy for hooking me up with this gem. Cheers to you bro!"
""

"One pint can poured into my Duvel glass. A rich golden honey body has a consistent haze to it. I get only about one inch of head that fades in just a couple of minutes. Head is a soft beige in color. Only edges of lace are left behind. Nose is full of orange rind and marmalade. Softly fragrant but very nice. With first sip I am really taken by how dry this beer is. Based on the nose I was really expecting something a little more citrus based and maybe a bit sweater. Not that I am complaining but the nose threw me off. The hop profile is nicely bitter and extremely dry. There is a twinge of lemon zest on the on the back end of the palate. This beer is not heavy at all and would go wonderfully with some stinky blue cheese. Dryness lingers on the mouthfeel but is just wonderful. A very nice break from all the more sweet IPAs out there lately."
""
"Overall - Phenomenal contender with the rest of the DIPA crew. This brew is for serious hop heads. Others are likely to cringe or cry."
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer a lot. It definitely strikes the chords as """abrasive.""" I tend to like a little sweeter and brighter IIPAs, but nonetheless I have to hand it to Surly. They hit their intended mark with this beer right on the head."
""
""
""
""
""
" O - an excellent ale. Just one of the finest dipas i have ever had the pleasure of trying."
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, this is one of most under-hyped beers and I'm glad folks keep it that way...for now. I can see why it continues to receive 100% score from people and it's right up at the top...even better than Hopslam at the elite level. It's all about the citrus and bitterness flavor. If you prefer a malt-forward or sorta """barleywine""" DIPA, don't waste your time trying this beer. Okay, do try this beer if you haven't done so because it has the power to convert you! Kudos to Surly Brewing Company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Abrasive Ale pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, with a large white lacing head. There is a strong floral aroma, with hints of citrus. The taste is sublime, strong floral hops, hints of citrus. Such a full and complete flavor, yet sooo drinkable. Overall all I can say is WOW."

"Overall this is a well made hop bomb of a beer. If that's your thing, this beer is worth a shot. In the realm of Pliny's, Hopslams, Heady Toppers, Pure Hoppiness and the like, does this beer hold up? It's in the conversation, but ultimately I couldn't say i'd put this beer ahead of any of those (my old ratings aside)... but if its a step down from those it is a very minor one. In the end, there is something to be said for a beer that delivers exactly what it promises."
"Overall I enjoyed this but sadly not as much as it's lighter cousin Furious. I don't think over a month is a death sentence for a DIPA but maybe a fresher example would have yielded a more impressive aroma. While this is a world class example of the style, I still found the price point a bit high. The flavor profile is super amazing, but nothing that hasn't been done before. With all the new hop styles available it seems you need to reinvent yourself to be continuously impressive to induce repeat purchases. If it was easier to get I would probably purchase again but for close to half the cost, Furious is more drinkable and sessionable and probably easier to get on the daily."

"Overall: I see what all the hype is about. This is a really smooth drinking, hopforward double IPA that lives up to its name. It definitely hides its 9% ABV very well and is a delectable gobletful of citrus, tropical fruit and pine bitterness. If you're a huge hophead, this is a fantastic example of a beer you'll give all 5's to. For me, I think it could be a little bit more malty to back up the hops and it'd meet my preferences for a more balanced DIPA that I've come to love- such as Pliny the Elder and this year's Hopslam- both of which are on the sweeter side to go along with their hopforwardness. I would definitely get it every year as long as I live near Minnesota. (4.75)"
""
"finally, an abrasive in my glass! been reading about this one forever, so nice to finally get the chance to indulge. and an indulgence this is! pours a sleek reddish orange color with some haze and a couple inches of impenetrable white head. the nose is way way more fruity than I anticipated, super juice fresh squeezed hop complexion, with some pine and definitely an acidic citrus element, but I get a lot more berry and even passionfruit in this. some lighter American 2 row and caramel malts round it out. the flavor is more tropical than deciduous in the fruit department, but still pungently fruity. bitterness doesn't even come in until the finish, which makes this a really unique double ipa. the alcohol is almost entirely invisible until the beer warms up, and even then isn't punishing by any stretch. the mouthfeel is the weakest link, not bad, but a little more malt body might balance this out little better. I feel like it needs a bigger platform to stand out. carbonation is right on though, and it makes the grapefruit and other citrus hops characters come out a little more. id love to know what hops are used in this, its really different. Maybe not the most perfect example of the style out there, but you don't get to be a 100 on BA in this category by accident. Worthy of my anticipation, this is a stellar beer. I can still name a handful of others id draft higher, but this is awesome!"
""
""
"O: I really liked Surly Abrasive ale and was psyched to get a chance to try it. I don't think it is quite as good as some of the top-shelf, hop-forward DIPAs like PtE (which while dry still has some malt slickness to it), Hopslam (also dry from the honey but still with more heft than Abrasive), or Maharaja (which has come off as a little sweet in the past but was great this year). If they ramped up the mouthfeel a tad to give a little more body, this would be a top 10 DIPA. Still a great beer and definitely worth seeking out."
"O: I really dislike CTZ hops and I have a palate that picks up off flavours with beers that are heavily hopped with CTZ which is why I disliked this beer so much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really want to like this beer and the brewery, but I can get as good or better beers in glass. I know cans are better for recycling, but anything is better in glass then cans. I would pay more for glass then cans, and craft beer is best in a bottle or a keg. NEVER a can."
""
""
"O: Definitely an elite DIPA, and especially for the bitter-seekers. The mouthfeel makes it for me, it could be near perfect if the hop flavor was more present in the taste as it is in the nose. Definitely enjoyed though."

"O: On my Untappd check-in, I said """I will miss this beer""" and it's true. I've had a few different offerings from Surly and have enjoyed them all, but Abrasive is definitely my favorite. Would love to try it on tap someday. Drink it if you can."
"O- I wrote in my notes """Perfect""" but this was not my first pint on this particular occasion but still rings pretty true. I love this ale. The bitterness hide the reasonably high abv Abrasive offers which needs to be taken into account since after only one or two is plenty for the consumer. The fact that this particular establishment served the Abrasive in pints and not smaller pours also could get people into trouble. Cheers."

"Overall. A fine DIPA with everything you could ask for. Very tasty. Thanks again, Ryan!"

"O: 5 - BOOM3: this is the best imperial IPA in the world to my palate and satisfies all that I look for in a double IPA, but, in keeping with the Surly theme, they brew the kind of beers that you never knew you wanted until you tasted it; for me, this is better than Pliny the Younger, Heady Topper et al., welcome to your new favorite big DIPA"
""
"Great DIPA from Surly, and very easy drinking."

"O: Love it. My favorite overall ale…or maybe tied with Pliny. Just an amazing brew. Nothing, other than Pliny comes close."
"O- I just checked my review for Furious that I wrote a week ago, and I gave it the exact same score as I am for this guy. The only main difference I find in these two is the Furious shows off the citrus characteristics a bit better whereas Abrasive is a bit more earthy and herbal which is a bit confusing since Furious uses Amarillo and Simcoe hops which are generally more earthy and Abrasive uses Citra (which is obviously more citrusy) and Warrior...Maybe I'm overthinking this and should just enjoy the beer. Cheers!"
"O: While it obviously could be fresher, drinking 3 months old), you can tell this is a very excellent DIPA. I would say that the name Abrasive though is pretty fitting as the beer doesn't shy away from pounding your face with hops. That being said, it is well balanced, though a bit double headed. A nice balance between very tropical sweets and bitter citrus's. Very nice drinking beer as well, though I would say it is the slightest bit more harsh that Heady, the transition/blend not being as smooth, & the hops are more in your face and I don't quite get the same hop complexity I find in a Heady, also not quite as strong IBU it feels. (Again, could be the age... ) Looking forward to trying this fresh one day though and it certainly doesn't fade in the shadow of other hyped DIPA's.."

"Killer brew. Unique in that it's big, but not big in hop bouquet or taste bounty or diversity/saturation. It has its own interestingly bitter profile(onion, garlic, scallion) in comparison to Heady, Pliny, etc. It stands on its own, and I love that."

"Wouldn't have sought this out, but was lucky enough to try at a bottle share. Wow! So fresh and lively. Citrusy pine and a bit of tropical fruit, but overall just very clean flavors. I think the packaging is terrible, but the beer is excellent. Like a whole can of liquid hops. Yum!"

"Poured from the can into a pint glass, the beer was a light copper color with a slight white head. It left acceptable lacing and retention in the glass. A big floral citrus aroma jumped from the glass, awakening the sense of smell. In the front, notes of peach, pineapple, apple came from the hops. A pleasant maltiness laid in the background as to not allow the hops to be overwhelming. The hops notes seem to unify in the end to a megahop that resembles grapefruit at its base in the aftertaste. Pleasantly warming notes are allowed to linger with thick texture helping the sensation to cling to the back of the throat. This is an excellent example of the style that I could drink any time."

"Bottom Line: Legendary beer that lives up to the hype!"
"O: Overall this is an outstanding DIPA, the only knock I gave it is the taste failing to live up to the nose. I've been a huge fan of all the Surly beers I've tried so far, and this did not disappoint. I've got family in Minnesota...maybe I need to plan a trip out there soon!"
"Overall: This beer is absolutely amazing, hands down my favorite DIPA. Given it's drinkability, it's price and 2-4 month availability, this may actually be my favorite beer of all time."

"The smell is of strong, dank hops. The fruity citrusy smell is there, but the skunkier side is present as well. Taste is exactly how it smells. Quite good! Mouthfeel is a tad sticky, but not too much. Overall, it's a world class DIPA. A very strong beer(though a bit inconsistent in my experience). However, at 19 bucks a 4 pack, it also makes me want to say Kudos to the Alchemist/NEB and others for providing very similar beers for a lot less money."

"O: Been hearing about this for a few years now, and it definitely lives up to the hype. Fantastic IIPA. Luckily, I have 3 more cans to enjoy."
"Overall: one of the best beers I've tried in awhile 9% w great taste. Surly does it again, always walked by this in the liquor store and now I regret it."
""
"O: Certainly one of the better DIPAs out there. Great complexity of hop flavors and aromas. Little malt but oddly enough not a huge bitter bomb, the hop flavors really shine all on their own. Delicious."
""

"O - well I can't give it a 5 overall since 2 categories were 4.5, but seriously, this is one of my absolute favorites. The look and smell alone propel it towards the top, and the beer does not disappoint. Fantastic."

"I pretty much stopped reviewing new beers, but i thought this one was special. Appearance is a guess, I drink this one like I drink HT out of the can. The nose is a grapefruit smashed into the can, really a wonderful smell, and if i get this up front I generally l know I'll love the beer. The taste really follows the nose, lots of citrus, and a ton on hops right up front. Not quite as balanced as HT, and a little more bitter, this one is very close in taste profile, but I think Abrasive has more citrus hits. This is a great brew from start to finish, and it's a little sad when you hit your last sip out of your last can. If this was available all the time it would always be in my fridge as would HT, sitting side by side where they would belong. 15 bucks a 4 pk isn't exactly cheap either, but as always france 44 gives you fresh stuff."
""

"Overall, another outstanding beer from Surly. These guys are easily in the top 10 breweries in the USA. This beer pushes the edge, and isn't overly """drinkable", but I'm a big fan. Wish I had a few more of these sitting in the fridge..."

"this is my favorite ipa so far from surly.. it's honestly hard to be let down by this brewery. an excellent double ipa."
""
"Surly's good but overrated and EXTREAMLY OVERPRICED! hopefully this review doesnt get revoked for being too negative, but i dont think surly has bought off B.A. yet... like it seems they possibly have with the """Growler""" magazine (look at the Dec/Jan issue)"
""
""
"O - Wow, one of the best IIPA I have ever had, definitely top 5. There is no doubt in my mind this is the best beer in a can I have ever had. So glad I have 3 more to drink. I also like the size, 16 oz..sometimes a 12 is not enough but a bomber too much. May update when I do a side by side with some fresh Pliny and Dreadnaught next weekend! The only reason I didn't rate it higher is I think Dreadnaught is better and I haven't given any beer a perfect 5."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My first thought is that I am furious (see what I did there?) that I didn't buy more than one 4-pack while in Minny on a work trip. It would be really, REALLY, hard to beat this, but I just can't stomach giving something all 5's across the board. Would take this over many rated higher, and yes, that includes Pliny. Just another Surly thing that rises to expectations for me."
""
"I get a nice Bitter kick with some tropical fruits mixed in the background. It is smooth and in your face at the same time, which is what I think makes a great DIPA, and this is that for sure, Up there with Pliny and Citra for sure."
""
"O: a beautiful IPA that we had up against Heady - I give HT the win in smell and taste, but this probably takes the rest (especially appearance). Very nice to drink, would love more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, certainly a good beer, but a little overhypered IMO. Enjoyable for sure, with a wonderful aroma, but the taste falls a little short for me and its boozier tasting than what I look for in a DIPA, which detracts from the hop profile. Don't get me wrong, if this were available to me on the shelves where I live, I would buy a 4 pk on every release, but with such high expectations it just came up a little short. Good beer, but not amongst my favorite DIPAs."
""
"Overall: This is probably the 50th can I've had of this stuff, and I can find no faults. With all respect to Hill Farmstead, The Alchemist, Lawson's, Russian River, Kern River, Alpine, DC Brau, Pipeworks, 3 Floyds, etc etc etc etc. This is the best DIPA on the planet, to my palate."
""
"O- This has instantly become one of my favorite DIPAs, the juicy, fruity hop flavors are straight up delicious and it's pretty easy to knock back even at 9%. This is easily one of the best DIPAs that is being made today."
""
"O:I am shocked that I am saying this (especially as an imported vermonter)but this is the first beer that legitmently compares with my favorite dipa ever Heady Topper its not as good but its the first one that I have found that is comparable in taste and smell. It is very hop forward with very little bitterness thick smooth mouthfeel decent drinkability and a good smell/slash appearance. Nothing bad to say I would buy it all the time if it were available. Also my first surly beer and I will be back."
""
""
"I've liked or loved everything canned from Surly and this is no different. Super drinkable, flavoursome and most of all balanced. Having this in Australia within 3 weeks of canning is a real treat. Thanks Max!"
""
""
"Truly unblemished with a genuinely deliciously hop profile. As someone who has fallen out of love with pointlessly big or bitter IIPAs, it's reassuring to know that when done intelligently they can be balanced and approachable, without sliding into gratuity."
""
""
""
"D - Very tasty but could easily forget the ABV."
""
"Poured into a darkness snifter. Nice white creamy head and a beautiful golden hue on the liguid. Smell is mild grapefruit. Taste is a load of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and some slight lemon zest. What really balances this is a mild sweetnes (honey maybe) that really ties everything together. The finish is very clean and you can't wait for the next sip. The alchol is very well hiden and there is a nice effervesence to the mouth feel. Fantastic beer!"
"Pours a crystal clear pure golden color with an antique white head. The head is quite stubborn, contributing to the aesthetics of the beer. It has primarily a grapefruit nose with some pine breaking through. The bouquet is vibrant and it doesn't fade as the head dissipates. It has a big, thick, full mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation to accentuate the entire experience. The usual pine and grapefruit flavors, but with an extraordinary balance. I've begun to notice that with these IPAs, the key component is balance. Nose, mouthfeel, flavor, finish--this one has it. It all works well together like a well-oiled machine."
""
""
""
"O - my favorite DIPA to date."
""
"Final Thoughts: I was expecting to be blown away by this one and it basically met my expectations. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'm going to dish out the nearly $18 for another four-pack at least one more time this year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think Abrasive is truly one the best IIPAs on the planet. Somewhat expensive at $17/4pack yes, but completely worth it to experience this one."
"Fresh abrasive from John, brewed less than 2 weeks earlier. Wafts hops several feet. Light yellow with a big head. Big IBU. Good drinkability. Orange, tangerine, fantastic IPA, great hops. Slightly acidic, do not try to convert someone drinking Bud all night. Crazy great blend of hops."
""
""
"Pours a deep gold with lush orange-tinged amber hues topped with a two finger bright white head. Good retention and quite a bit of splotchy lacing. Pineapple, mango, and a touch of spruce on the nose. Pineapple, mango, and papaya intially, joined by a bit of sweet malt, and balanced with grapefruit rind and piney bitterness. Finishes clean and dry. Fairly fully bodied, moderate carbonation, slick and smooth on the palate. Abrasive is one of my personal favorite DIPA's. Not overly sweet, complex, abundant flavor, just the right amount of hop bitterness, and a pleasantly dry finish. Truly world-class."
"I just finished enjoying a 2012 Abrasive from a can that was brewed nine days ago. I poured the contents into a pint glass straight out of the fridge at around forty degrees. The beer was pale orange in appearance with average carbonation and a slight slight haze, but still transparent with a single finger of head. Straight off the pour I could smell the hop aroma before I even put the glass up to my nose, very citrus forward with a malt presence. The first sip was straight grapefruit followed by the entire spectrum of citrus flavors, strong malt presence quickly balanced out the strong hop rush that blew my socks off. The sides of my tongue were left with a lingering bitterness, not unpleasant just enough to let you know the hops were still there. The alcohol was hidden deep in this beer and even after it warmed up I could not taste any heat through the hops. The mouth feel was just what I look for in an IPA, it has some body but not too much so that it was not refreshing. Even though this beer comes in at 9% ABV I had no second thoughts about going to the fridge and pouring a second after I slugged down the first. Overall Abrasive is an amazing beer and definitely lives up to the hype, I can't believe I only bought one four pack. I tend to be promiscuous with my beers, but if I ever had to settle down I probably could with this beer."
""
""
""
"This is my favorite beer. I have had some friends who said the don't care for it but it is my favorite so I totally disagree with the bad reviews. If you like a super IPA, you will like this beer beer. My wife and several close friends who dig beer don't care for this beer so it's obviously not for everyone, but I LOVE THIS BEER! It taste great and has a great alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
"A wonderful, strong as hell IPA. Smell is otherworldly. Tropical, piney and dank. Tastes good as well. Hawaiian Punch beerified. A tad sweet, it's a big beer, but I like my DIPAs dry. A bit to full in the mouth as well. Bitter sweet finish. Extremely enjoyable beer."
""
"Holds its own against any of the highly acclaimed DIPAs."
"Overall: This beer crushes. The best part about it is the smell. So much going on with the citrusy fruit that leaves you wanting more after every sip. Definitely try to seek this one out, it is one of the best around."

"16oz can courtesy of beeranddogs. Pours a clear orange with a towering, creme head. Huge lace and infinite retention. Nose is not fresh hoppy but not stale hoppy, strawberry pancake syrup either. There is some candy corn, maple syrup, Taste is spicy, sweet, fruit punch, floral and herbal hoppy, loaded with honey, mint, butterscotch. Body is chewy, bitter, thick. Definitely not a hop bomb. Never devolves into an astringent, cloying mess. Even not ultra fresh, it has held itself together fairly nicely. 11/9/2010 6/5/7/4/14=3.6"

"I enjoyed this bitter beer more than I thought I would. I'm not falling for the Surly Cult, but this was a good beer. It was very crisp and went well with a contrastingly rich mac and cheese meal. A strong taste of pine/grapefruit. Light in color and smooth, I think this is a good summer session beer, in my opinion."

"Pours a fairly dark copper to light amber color with a nice off white bubbly head that leaves some lacing and fades to a solid ring with a film over the beer. The nose is made up of mostly pine and some herbal floral notes with a touch of citrus. The taste blends the different hop characters extremely well mixing the pine and citrus with a noticeable malt backing. Medium bodied with good carbonation and a lingering bitterness. Very good beer."

"O-If you like DIPAs you must give this one a try. Truly unique and named appropriately. Too bitter and hop resin/oily for my taste but cool to give a try."

"O: A nice DIPA, though too bitter for me. I do like how clean and dry the beer is while remaining flavorful."
"O: Damn if this isn't a top 5 DIPA. (Number 2 all time) It lingers behind Founders Devil Dancer but it polevaults Double Jack in flavor profile even though D.J is more easy to enjoy. For Serious Serious HOP HEADS ONLY!!"
"The name abrasive is apt, this is a palate-crusher. The only drawback is the high price."
"This one glugs out a deep orange color with a finger of persistent head. The aroma is full of juicy citrus hops, with noticeable (yet not distracting) caramel malts in the back. The taste is, yet, another knockout for Surly in the IPA department. The taste is very heavy on the pine and citrus hops, with light caramel malts in the background. The finish is fantastic, with a perfect amount of hop bitterness (read: a lot) lingering on the tongue long after taking a sip. A hophead's delight. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's mouth-coating and """weighty", yet goes down very easily. The dirnkability is very good. Overall, it's yet another superlative IPA from Surly. As soon as I get a better job, Merwin Liquors has to watch out, as I'll be getting all Surly on their online store."

"O - freshness was probably an issue here but a tasty beer anyway; i think the citrus notes from the hops would be brighter closer to canning"
"A very big thanks to Billakowski for sending me this one. Opened this one up and poured it out to see it's beautiful clear golden color. The head was big and foamy with a nice white color. The smell of this beer was very nice, I loved the hoppy aroma of this beer. The taste was awesome too, there was a big bitterness in there and then deep in the aftertaste I was picking up a honey like flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and gently carbonated. Overall I thought this beer was awesome. I look forward to having more from Surly one day."
"D: pretty tasty DIPA. the malt provides enough balance in a brew that really focuses on making warrior and citra hops the main stars."
""
"Edit: Palates shift and so do yearly hop flavors. Man this is a tremendous DIPA. More sweet citrus and tropical flavors this time around, simply awesome."
"Canned 2-13-12. Pours a clear, light amber color with a large, off-white head. Scent is quite hoppy with a nice malt backbone as well. Earthy hop aromas with some caramel malt a bit of grass. Some grapefruit and melon. Taste is initially quite citrusy. A blast of orange, lemon zest, grapefruit at first. Nice grass and pine resin...pretty dank flavors here. Kinda reminds me of Maharaja. Finishes bitter with a lot of caramel malt. A bit of alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and somewhat creamy. Crisp bitter finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I'm really glad I got to try this. It's a great double IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"Superb lacing with a brilliant orange-yellow body full of hazy hop oils. Creamy mouthfeel. I wouldn't say it's """full""" body, but it's definitely rich with dextrins and visible hop oils, which aids mouthfeel to the moderately high side of things. I think I prefer this to Elder. It's close. It just doesn't look as pretty."

"Edit - has this on tap at Stub and Herbs yesterday, and it is so much more amazing when fresh. Unless the cans are <1 week old, they don't do this beer justice. HUGE citrus taste that explodes in the mouth - mango, pineapple, apricots, nectarines. Incredibly drinkable and delicious. Far superior to Hopslam (I would score it almost 5)"
"O - One of my favorite DIPA’s. Surly knows how to make a damn good hoppy beer."
"Overall exceptional and darn close to Hopslam in top tier DIPAs. Always welcome as an extra!"
""
""
"Verdict: A great DIPA from Surly. The flavors are nicely balanced and with great malty elements with solid hoppy flavors and a nice dry finish, this should be on any hopheads wish list."

"Abrasive is a solid IIPA, but I have to say I would prefer a furious any day. Still, Surly doesn't miss on beers very often, and this is certainly not a miss."
""
"I nice amber/orange color with a nice two-finger width fluffy head that leaves a nice ring of lacing. If has a huge grapefruit nose followed by a little pine, and finally a hint of some sweetness. After my first sip I feel that I noticed more bitterness in the nose than I am actually drinking. The grapefruit bitterness is there but leaves quickly and doesn't linger on my tongue it is followed up by a malty sweetness. There is also some fruit flavor like orange/tangerine or some other sweet fruit, last there is a good piny flavor to it as well. It has a medium/thin mouthfeel but when compared to others in the style I find it a little too thin for me, the carbonation is on point. Overall this is a good beer if this was local I would drink it, but IMO there are others in this style that are better."
""
"O- Overall, great double IPA and extremely drinkable. Watch out for that 9%. I'd love to put some spicy food against this."
"O: This is a very good DIPA. I'm glad I was able to grab a 4-pack but at the cost I got it for (purchased from france44.com) I will probably not quickly seek out another. Really solid though altogether."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great beer, a just short of being my favorite of the style. We did our annual three-way blind test of this against Pliny and Hopslam, and Abrasive came out in the middle this year (just barely behind Pliny but way ahead of this year's Hopslam). Surly continues to impress."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a wonderful DIPA, and the second best such beer available in a pint can! Great blend of hop flavors with sweet malt flavors."
"Overall: Real good not great DIPA"
"O - A hoppier DIPA that leaves some hoppy bitterness, more than you would expect from the smell and the initial flavors you get. However, I was a little let down by this one as I did not think it was an elite DIPA. I'm happy to have some to try but would not go thru the work to get it. I have to say I actually like Furious much better."
"O: Very few DIPAs do it better than Abrasive. This is an excellent and complex DIPA. A hop bomb, but incredibly smooth. Great beer."
""
"O: If I had access to this beer all the time I would definitely buy it. An excellent DIPA."
""

"Overall: Hops and grapefruit dominate aroma and taste. Great bitterness and I love the peach/mango finish. Full bodied and very well balanced. Cheers."
"I love Abrasive season and remember my first experience when a buddy brought over two growlers of 16 grit. We put one out for the party crowd and split the other. I miss the surly growlers."
"I need to trade for a whole 6 pack of this."
""
"O: In my opinion this is tied for the best DIPA in the country with Hopslam. Nothing else comes close (not even PtE). It's a shame that it isn't available more widely, or for more of the year, but that does nothing to bring down it's score. Any true hop lover should make it a priority to obtain some of this at your earliest convenience. You won't be disappointed."
"16 ounce, canned on 1/12/12. Orange in color, appears to glow. Aroma includes pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and cannabis (yes, some weed). Taste is biting and bitter and yet so drinkable. The bitterness actually made my mouth salivate in some very weird way, kinda near the front of my mouth, that's never really happened before. Kinda hard to explain. Bottom line, so much great flavor crammed into the can, just an awesome double."

""

"O - The 9% is nowhere to be found in the taste. This is a very easy drinking DIPA, not at all in your face, that has a nicely balanced flavor profile."
""
""
""
"O - Solid DIPA. These guys have yet to disappoint. I'm looking forward to my next trip to procure a few more of these, because it is simply delicious and would be well received by any hop head."
""
"O- I wasn't expecting a hell of a lot out of this but I was pleasantly surprised. Drinks pretty nice for the style alcohol content."
""
""
"D - this is a hop bomb all the way. I have been wanting to try this one for a while. Fortunately I got a fresh can from jawzman. One of the better DIPAs out there - seek it out if you can."
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious DIPA that is certainly worthy of attention. Seek this one out!"
""
""
"Yeup. Hops. Citrus and tropical. Green grass and green pine. A touch """abrasive""" (zing), but great flavors. The malt is happy where it is, and so am I. Got take away 1/2 point for not being balanced, but it's darn fine."
"Overall; a rock solid DIPA, I would absolutely seek this out again... I was slightly let down by Furious and I'm starting to think that my choice to drink Hopslam and then Furious was a poor one given how I feel about Abrasive... I was a little concerned about the onion bomb some have described this beer to be, but I went into it with an open mind and I feel like I was greatly rewarded. I definitely recommend Abrasive, and will absolutely seek out both Abrasive and Furious again in the future!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, but I feel there are so many better examples of the style out there. If I lived in Minnesota and had easy access to this beer I know I would drink it again in the future, but since I don't I really can't see myself seeking this one out again."
"o: i think this is beter than furious. very well balanced. if it wasnt for the 9% i could drink this all night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This DIPA is a lot more refined than I though. It didn't abuse my palate like I thought it would but it was very well put together. I have a couple more cans and I look forward to moving through them"
"Overall: A great beer. In high DIPA season, I only wish I had regular access to this bad boy. It would be my fridge beer for the season."
"Overall, great."
"O: Hands down the best canned beer I've ever had from Surly. This DIPA is borderline over the top, as it puts one foot over the ledge then steps slowly back. A grand achievement, and one I recommend seeking out in large quantities."
"O: This is a very good IIPA but it falls short of famed and beloved Dreadnaught on taste and balance."
""
"D/O: This remarkable DIPA yields a smell that outdistances all other features, though honest orange flavor is not without its charms. It proves to be an uncluttered and effective canvas for inspired hop qualities."
""
"Very nicely balanced and flavorful IIPA."

"O - Definitely one of the top DIPAs I've had, for being 9% I was very happy with how smooth it was. Need to get my hands on more of this!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Furious on steroids. Love this beer. Demand more. ISO: more furious FT: Fresh Pliny/Blind Pig"
""
""
"The lack of naked Katy Perry lookalikes notwithstanding, this might be the best beer I've ever had. Painfully spendy, but I'm willing to sell my children for more."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap. Thick chunks of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is super hoppy: citrus zest/grapefruit, pine, and some earthy herbal aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, pine, and herbal hops, grapefruit, and a malt backbone on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good and very hoppy DIPA. However, the name is a bit misleading because I don't find anything abrasive about this beer."
"This beer pours a medium bodied, smooth and creamy dark apricot orange in color with an incredibly smooth creamy off white one finger head. The nose is full of citrusy, tangerine like hops with moderate sweetness and mild bitterness. The hop profile is full of oranges, tangerines, and sweet apricots. Great, fresh and fruity appeal. The flavors are smooth, mildly bitter citrusy hops once again. The orange, tangerine, and apricot marmalade are superb. This beer drinks ultimately smooth and the alcohol isn't noticeable whatsoever. This is a really nice IPA and as always, Surly captures what an IPA can be like few others."
""
""
""
"O- Very good Dipa, Im glad I sought this one out. I thought Furious was good, this is better. Its Furious's bigger older brother, an Abrasive is the Alpha. This is a beer I want all year round. Its a perfect balance of tropical citrusy fruit, pine, and sweeet bready caramelly malts. The hype behind this one is warranted as was the time i spent trying to find it. Get yourself some, when and if you can. Highly Recommended."

"just wow. I've enjoyed it in cans before, but it was pretty special from a cask. Right up there with CBS and Surly Moe's Firkin Bender as the best beers I've ever had."
"O-wonderful well balanced beer. Right up there with dreadnaught as my favorite DIPA's ever. If you ever have the opportunity to get this beer don't think twice. It is unique and delicious."
"O - Glad I traded for this one. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had."
""
""
"O - Overall an excellent beer, but I don't know if I can call it my favorite DIPA. Definitely glad to try it though!"
""
"O: Great beer and one I'd love to try again!"
""
"Brought some home from a recent trip to MSP. There are only a handful of beers that I can say put me in the happy place like Abrasive and Furious is one of them (Zoe, Lunch and Two Hearted Ale come to mind). If you can find this get some.. Rumor is the brewery is moving which I assume will be to a larger facility which will increase their output which will me more beers more locations.."
""
"O. I love this beer. It's well balanced flavor, and an amazing smell. I could open a can of this and leave it in my bathroom as an air freshener! This is a super tasty beer. Everyone should try this beer at least once (But needing to have more won't be an option)."
""
""
""
"A truly perfect DIPA. This ranks with the best of the best (Yes, it's better than Pliny)."
"O - a very good example of the style."
""
"Pours a deep amber color with a meek off-white head. Retention is as expected for a 9% ABV beer, it settles to a splotchy film. Smell is of some sort of citrus, like an apricot or nectarine. Taste starts with smooth caramel malt and some more of that apircot taste. I get some resinous hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly on the heavy side, with enough carbonation to give a playful feel. Overall, a great beer, but not in my top 5 for DIPAs."
""
""
""
"A great DIPA. Filled with flavor and doesn't come off as alcoholic at all. A really wonderful beer"
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite Surly brews and DIPA's in general, i'm very fortunate to be able to find this locally. I cant help but compare it to Avery Maharaja which i think is fairly similar in style and complexity. I remember taking down a couple of growlers of this stuff with friends when it was called 16 Grit. Have loved it ever since. I'm glad i only have 11 more in my cellar to finish up. =)"

"A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Killer beer. Too bad it is so damn expensive, or I would send more out to people."
""
"I've been hoping for an opportunity to try some beers from Surly for some time, and this one hit it out of the park for me. Golden peach color with a tight white head. Faintly sweet and floral in the nose. Perfectly balanced big hops punch up front, with a honey sweetness playing off the hops bittering. No alcohol notes, other than a little pepper at the finish. Wonderfully smooth for a DIPA. I would put this head-to-head with Hopslam."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite the mouthfeel, this is an outstanding beer. The hop flavors and aromas are excellent. With a bit more carbonation this beer would be in the running for the best DIPA I've ever had."
""
""
"O: This beers nose was just great, must be insane fresh. Overall I liked this beer a ton, quaffed it pretty fast."
""
"Overall; for me, this definitely deserves to be Surly's claim to fame. Have had a fair amount of their offerings and been quite underwhelmed but this is a top notch dipa with increadibly aroma, hop presence, and balance...glad I have a few more cans! Thanks to Laymansbeerfan for the super fresh 12-21-11 double IPA."
""
""
""
"Overall is just fantastic. Outstanding drinkability. Love the Surly!"
""
"Overall: One of the most well-executed DIPAs to date. Loads of hop flavor, but it never becomes too much. Malts come with just the right balance to keep it all on point. Tons of flavor and for the ABV, insane drinkability."

"The overall drinkability is top notch. My absolute favorite DIPA. Maybe my favorite beer out there. Thank you Surly."
"O - Hop juicy love. Pungent, sexual hop sweat."

"O: Absolutely a world class DIPA. This year's batch seems even better than past incarnations. So good, I think I'll just have to drink 1 more"
""

"what a beer, tastes insanely fresh. maybe the best DIPA ever? thats hard to say but its definatly right up there with pliny for me. every hop head needs to do whatever they need to do to seek this out. great stuff."

""
""
""

"Cost: $15.99 for a four pack."

"Met all my expectations, drinkable as an IPA and strong as a double. Full and creamy mouthfeel without becoming overly malty and sweet. Really solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice DIPA with a bright, well rounded pine hop character."
""
"Poured the can into a pint glass. The color was a dark golden amber that looks a whole lot like furious. There was more head retention that lingered on the sides of the glass as I drank it. The smell was pheonemenal. Not only could I smell the ubiquitous hops, but the signature furious malt bill is evident, too. The taste is much more hop forward than furious, but does maintain some balance. This beer rivals sculpin and pliny, but yet is an unquestioned original. The mouthfeel is good. Similar to furious, again, in that it isn't highly carbonated. But that works. First time I've tried this beer, had two cans and will put this up there with the best double IPAs you can find anywhere."
""
"D - One of the most masterfully balanced IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking. If you can, give this one a go."
"This beer is a nice super drinkable pounder can double IPA, and I've never had one in this format. I love the can art made by ball corporation, many local friends work for them in Weirton, WV. Pours a pale amber copper hue with a light colore billowing off white head, fine even lacing traces the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma is full of vegetal, onion/garlic spiciness. I can only guess that there's Summit hops in here with the taste I'm getting. The flavor is nice, this beer was canned on 12/14/11 we're talking super fresh. No abv or IBU info on the can, I find that hard to believe. They so proudly offered up 6.2% abv ad 99 IBUs on the Furious can, why not the abrasive ale. Alcohol is evident especially as it warms, it doesn't ruin the experience it is just there. Overall a very special DIPA in the can, my first experience with this style in that format. Surly is brave, and somewhat abrasive, but I enjoyed this beer carbonation is sturdy and body is full with resinous oils in the mix."
"If you love mass quantities of hops, get Abrasive soon, it's a seasonal."
"O - This beer is spectacular. When fresh, one of the more complete IIPAs and shows the versatility of hop flavors and aromas. Great balance and a joy to drink."
""
""
"O: Big, rich and complex; a formidable blend. A wonderful DIPA. Good on you, Surly!"
"O-This is an excellent DIPA. If you enjoy hops, this one is a must. This was my first Surly offering and it didn't disappoint."
"Overall- An absolutely amazing beer! The citrus flavors are dangerously good. This offering from Surly is a must have if you are a hop head."
""
""
"High B"
"O: This is a really good beer, especially if you're a Hop Head, but it's not my favorite. I'll take a Furious over an Abrasive, 9 times out of 10."
"O: WOW. I need to run back and get a couple more of these!!! Very fresh and flavorful beer, aroma was AMAZING. Canned and consumed in less than a month... cant get much better than that! Surly you did it yet again!!! Glad to be a Minnesotan!"
"M: Viscous, as the style precludes, with some light carbonation (could be a little more), and a dry aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden and only comes through in the buzz you get after a couple sips. Wow."
""
"Overall, this is one killer brew. Loads of amazing hop character, enough maltyness to balance it nicely, and man, its gotta be the easiest drinking 8.8%abv beers out there. Easily my favorite double IPA, period."
""
""
"O - Very solid DIPA from Surly albeit a tad sweet for my taste. Great brew."
"O- Overall, another great hopped up offering from Surly. Doesn't quite get my pinkies twealing like Wet does, but it's pretty darn close. Abrasive, I hope we meet again in the near future."
"Aptly named. What a beer! Definitely the best thing I've had by Surly so far. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- I was worried that I was going to be disappointed with this beer because I have built the hype up so much in my head. Thankfully, this beer delivered on all fronts. One of the best DIPAs I've had period. I have to get more."

""
""
""
"A simply marvelous brew that is anything but simple. One of the best beers of 2011 for me..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Crisp, bitter, yet still refreshing. Rich and flavorful, and complex without being too overwhelming. A must have for hop-heads."
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper color with a smallish off white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of hops, tastes like em too. Lots of pine and citrus and floral hops with a faint bit of bready malt sulking deep in a dark corner. A bit of malt breaks through in the flavor but is quickly sent to its room by the onslaught of pine and citrus. Medium body and level of carbonation with a slick resinous almost sticky mouthfeel. Damn good beer right here, although I don't find it horribly abrasive as advertised. Then again I've spent the last few years building up an immunity to Iocane powder, I mean lupulin."
""
""
"O- Really good DIPA. Is it the best one I've had? No. Is it worth the hype? I'd also say no, but if you can get it or trade for it without giving up your first born I'd recommend trying it."
""
"O: Top class DIPA. Pretty big caramel presence. Not the explosion of flavor that I remember from last spring's release, but still very solid."
""
""
""
"(141st)"
"O: A great DIPA. It is not the king of DIPAs as some might argue, but still great."

"Overall this is an in-your-face - abrasive - DIPA that doesn't hold back. I'm most impressed by the incredible aroma but I'd buy this regularly if it was available in my market."
"overall, a very nice dipa. surly has yet to make a bad beer. unfortunately, this is a pretty limited seasonal release and quite expensive. a good beer, but at that price, i can find equal or better brews at a much better value"
"O- This is a big beer with the kitchenload of hops. Given the choice, I would actually give a slight edge to Surly Wet, but this is still a very very good hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bravo! Once again Surly kicks it."
"Overall an incredible beer and an excellent example of an American IIPA. Unmatchable showcase of hops."
"Overall an awesome IPA. I'm loving the citra/warrior combo. Though the malt bill is relatively complex in the recipe, it is sort of hidden beneath loads and loads of hops...not a bad thing though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Surly makes exceptional beers consistently and this beer is no different. It's not as intense as say Surly Wet is, but that's fine because its created it's own unique flavor! IPA and Hop lovers will find great joy in Abrasive Ale! Every IPA lover NEEDS to try this beer!"
"Overall this an incredible DIPA and, in my opinion, right up there with Pliny (I haven't tried Heady Topper). Recommended to all who can get it. I feel lucky and privileged to live in the same city as a brewery as skilled as Surly. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: Wonderful flavor ride! This is a very fresh beer. (Canned this month I believe). I believe the best way to drink an imp IPA is as fresh as possible."
"O: One of my favorite beers in existence. I will put this up against any DIPA (I'm looking at you, Pliny) any day of the week."
"Like It? Very Much So"
"Perhaps a bit sweet but a nice tropical IPA, surely not abrasive, a bit cloying, but otherwise easy to drink."

"From an old review Another great IPA from surly. From a 16 oz can pours a murky amber with a clean white head. Smell is of flowers, hops and citrus. Taste is that amazing bitter hop taste that smooths out with with the sweet after taste of hops and some honey taste."

"Rating: 93 out 100"
"Enjoy!"
"D: This is really fantastic.  Great aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel, and balanced perfectly.  Definitely competes for a spot in my top favorite DIPAs, and rightfully so.  Get this if you can!"
"Abrasive earned its spot as one of my favorite beers. Since first buying these a few months ago they've definitely fallen off a bit, but even slightly aged Abrasive is a top-tier beer"
"O: Even with some age on this age, its a world class beer that definitely stands up to the likes of Pliny and Alpine stuff. Furious and this are stupendous brews!"
"Rich aroma is quite hoppy with an overtone of citrus, about equal parts grapefruit and orange, and just a little bit sweet. It pours an attractive orange-amber with a very thick off-white head. Strongly hoppy flavor has an evergreen overtone, a fair amount of bitterness, and more than a hint of citrus with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Lively texture is fairly fizzy and leaves an edgy evergreen finish. How can anybody be abrasive after this one? Look for it, trade for it!"
"Just a terrific beer. If you see it somewhere, pounce on it."
"Overall: The name """Abrasive""" is definitely fitting! The malt bill tries to make a run at the extreme hop profile, but doesn't stand a chance. A bit too bitter for my liking, but I'm glad to have tried it. Would be interested in trying this one side-by-side w/ Hopslam in February!"
"love this beer, if i were in the great lakes area, it'd be a camping stand-by for me."
"O: Very, very good IIPA, but maybe with a fresher can I would rate this higher. It seems like better choices for the style are available year-round"
"Poured a hazy copper color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate to heavy complex earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish that was long lasting. This is a standout can beer."
"Mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy and full bodied. This is a delicious DIPA. It would certainly be in my top 10. Too bad it is not constantly available."
"O-overall id seek this out again. I love DIPA's and this was it great. Got great flavors througout and has the right amount of bitterness. Glad i have a MN hook up. WIll be trading for this every time it is fresh. Def. pick this beer up and try it if u can."
"Overall a great IIPA and I really appreciate the chance to try it, thanks again Torgo."
"I rarely encounter Double/Imperial IPAs that attempt to achieve balance. I feel that Abrasive does very well in this respect, but the result is that I thought it was a bit too heavy. I thought it could pass as a hyper-hoppy barleywine, but sadly I have not encountered anyone who agrees with me. Regardless... it's still borderline amazing."
"O: I'm a huge Surly fan and wish this was available year round, but due to the price it's probably good that it isn't. This is a great beer to have while out on the deck grilling."
"O: I'd give this beer a million stars if I could. It is where the bar is set for less amazing beers. It's hard to compare this to anything. I am sad to only have a few cans of this left until December. Bravo Surly this is one of the beers that hooked me on you."
"O- I was very happy to try this beer. If it was local, I would buy it all the time. The price/value is incredible with this beer. I wouldn't put it up there with hopslam and the like, but it is still incredible beer. This would hit the spot most any day of the week. I hope to find more. And the can is just cool."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is extremely hoppy and a good representation of a straight-to-the-point DIPA. Hops, hops and more hops. No bullshitting around here."
"O- Just an amazing DIPA. This is exactly what I love about IPA’s is the balance between sweet malts and citrus hops with just a perfect amount of bitterness. Don’t know how this isn’t in the top 5 DIPA’s."
"A hard pour into my DFH snifter produces a finger of off white head which recedes leaving a thin ring and minimal lacing.The beer is a dark, cloudy amber to orange color. The nose is pure citrus. Mango, orange and tangerine jump out at me. There is a subdued sweet malt presence as well, but the hops really shine here. Taste is a very balanced mixture of citrus hops and sweet bready malt. Grapefruit, orange and mango predominate. The finish is juicy and bitter at the same time with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy without being at all cloying. Overall this is a wonderful DIPA from surly. One of my all time favorites, which I seek out every year. Recommended."
"D - I had a PTE before this but its not as good. The mouthfeeel and sheer aggressive nature of this beer gives me an A+"
"O: Still guessing IPA and this one is sweet and definitely drinkable. Actually reminds me of Dale’s Pale Ale (also an IPA)."
"T- My its my all time favorite brew, really great balance. Great taste in the hop presence citra hops really shine in this one"
"T: The balance in this is perfect. Big citrus hop presence with some notes of candied grapefruit and a slight bit of white pepper. Caramel malts and some mango come in on the finish, which is smooth and sweet without being too sweet."
"D: Could easily put down a couple of four packs in one sitting, ridiculously easy to drink. In my dream they have these in 6 packs and even 12 packs at the local store."
"O- Excellent beer worthy of all the praise it recieves. I was kind of doubting that it could be as good as all the west coast ipa's that I love so much, but I shouldn't have. This is a great beer."
"MF/O: Prickly carbonation kind of takes away from the feel and intensifies the bitterness, but balanced. Kind of a west coast Hopslam. I will definitely be seeking this out again"
"After the awesome aroma, this had the makings of becoming one of my new favorites. Unfortunately, that massive onion taste just killed it."
"O- Damn Surly nailed this one. I really liked Furious, but I LOVE this... Makes me wish I could get their beers all the time. This really is one of the better double IPAs I have ever had. Great overall balance, flavor, and feel."
"Overall I am incredibly happy I finally got to try this. This was a great DIPA and well deserving of it's high ranking. Thanks again Kris."
"Overall: This is an awesome Double IPA. One of my favorites. All the flavors work together perfectly, don't change a thing."
"This beer pours a nice yellow orange color with a 1-2 finger off white head. the smell is very floral with citrus and earthy notes. the taste is pretty smooth and crisp with a little less bitterness than I expected. the mouthfeel was medium bodied with good carbonation. overall the beer is very drinkable and the abv is hidden well."
"Overall - This is a fantastic brew. Really is. I can't say that it's my favorite DIPA, but it's in my top 5 for sure. I may have to rethink positions of my top 5 after this. I had a can from 2/28/11 last night that was decent, but not great. The month fresher one absolutely changed my mind about this beer. I can only imagine what it would be like a week or two after canning. Overall I'd say 4.5 out of 5. Which is what I'd give all of my top 5 DIPAs. Seek this beer out!"
"Popped the 16 ounce can and poured this honey-colored nectar with an orange glow into my DFH becker and raised an unimpressive head that sacrificed its structure to support its offspring...really nice lacing. The aroma that wafted up from the glass was awesome...it's as if I'm peeling a ripe, juicy red grapefruit. And the good news is that it pretty much transfers to the taste. The malts are hard to pick out underneath all the bitterness from the hops, but if you concentrate you cut through those 120ish IBUs and taste something like a honey bun. This has a classic mouthfeel for a DIPA which means a medium-plus body with enough IBUs to make the staunchest hop head happy. In fact, I've had few IPAs better than this one (one or two), but I've got a Pliny waiting in the wings which, if its reputation holds serve, all the IPAs on my favorite list will drop a rung."
"O - This beer is amazing, get some if you can. A great DIPA that I will go back to in a heart beat. My only wish is that I could get it locally."
"This brew reminds me alot of Pizza Port Carlsbad's - Poorman's IPA which is a great thing. Best beer in a can I have come across so far. Well worth hunting down and highly recommended to all lupulin lovers!"
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. Golden with a red tint and a two finger head. Aroma is wow, citrus light pine and creamy malts. Simply amazing. The taste completely follows the nose just intensified. Really complex and smooth. Very drinkable, very refreshing. The best dipa I've ever had!"
"Overall I'm pretty impressed by this beer. The hop aroma is top notch, and the maltiness isn't too sweet. That's just what I want in a double IPA and this delivers. Wish this was available year round like the Furious because I like it better. Highly recommended..."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile here is really amazing. The flavors are really well balanced, especially the hop and malt balance here. This is a great beer."
"This one's approaching perfection though just shy of a 5.0. None the less, packing the hoppy punch and variety of flavor that makes for an exceptionally enjoyable double IPA."
"Good double IPAs usually feature some intense complexity of hops, or some intricate interplay of the hops and yeast. Normally I prefer the latter variety, but this is the most excellent example I've ever seen of the former."
"Big juicy body with well hidden alcohol. Liquid hops candy! Another great beer that lives up to its reputation - I guess the Beer Advocates know what they are talking about."
"Overall: Move over, Pliny and Hopslam."
"overall: wasnt completely blown away, and im not sure it lived up to my expectations after all the hype, but its still a great dipa and i havent had many that are better. definitely a top tier beer. would absolutely seek out again."
"A fantastic Surly brew! Thank you nppeders for another great trade! quite a can..."
"O - Amazing beer, great taste of hops, citrus, and malt that all work real well together. Can defitely feel the ABV, but well worth it. Would recommend this beer to anyone."
"O: A fantastic beer. One of the best examples of a DIPA I have had. A little too heavy to have a lot of but still drinkable."
"O: Now one of my favorite DIPAs."
"Holy shit, this is a total out-of-the-park offering from Surly. One of the best beers I have ever had. And I have nothing more to say, because it's time to kick back and simply enjoy this lovely, lovely beer..."
"o - double ipa perfection in a can."
"I still have 1 more can to drink and update if needed too, which is exciting."
"O- i really liked this one. the can seems fresher than my first pour of this back when it was called 16 grit. ill be looking to get more of this the next time its released. very solid DIPA in a can."
"O- I enjoyed this very much. Not a top 5 IPA for me, but a 10 for sure."
"Overall- I think I'm partial to Abrasive over PtE. Could be the lifecycles that each is in. EIther way, I love them both."
"O - This is a world class, big IPA. Rich, juicy, and decadent. Abrasive can easily hold it's own against two of my other favorite big West Coast IPA's! Excellent job, Surly! Bravo!!"
"O - A great DIPA. I'm going to try to find a fresh can for a new review."
"D- If I could get this where I am in Cali... This would be my go to hop satisfier. Really nice balance."
"O: A neutron bomb of a DIPA that is very drinkable. I could sip on this all night and into the morning. Slaps Furious aside as my favorite Surly beverage."
"OVERALL: Just awesome. This is the DIPA of DIPAs. Blows Pliny and Hopslam out of the water, and deserves every ounce of praise that it gets. I can see, just based on this can and Darkness, why MN folk lover their Surly. This is one I’ll definitely have to try to track down again. Thanks again G133 for making this part of our trade. Someone trade me more of this stuff please. Always ISO a 4 pack of this holly nectar. Highly recommended!"
"A tropical fruit hop bomb with an unforgiving bitterness. This is as good as they come, when it comes to Imperial IPAs. I highly recommend getting your hands on this beer, although you may have to wait until next year's release at this point."
"Overall an amazing beer. Bitter as all hell. But no grassiness that you sometimes get from overhopping. Very nice."
"M- Clean, crisp, and refreshing, with no lingering bitterness at all. A fantastic example of the style, and easily my favorite."
""
"Overall great beer, delicious hops, pine, tropical fruits, citrus, great nose, nice malty balance, fairly sweet to start and drier finish, booze is hidden well."
"Got this in a trade well worth it. I must try by any hop head as this one is great."
"Cheers."
"O: Because of the Pint size can, I probably wont ask for seconds, buts it enough to keep you thoughtful and mindful of what good hoppage is."
"16 oz. CAN poured gently into a Russian River flute glass. Huge fluffy/soapy offwhite, slightly beige head. Sticks all over the glass; excellent head retention. As I move in for a whiff, I am immediately smacked in the face with passion fruit and a pine tree. Incredible aroma. I could smell this all day; do they sell this in air-freshener form? Flavor is more passionfruit / grapefruit, pine, apricots, and sweet caramel malts. Floral/fruity hops lingering in the finish. Well carbonated, prickly on the tongue with a slightly sweet/sticky finish. Probably one of the best DIPAs I have ever tried."
"The mouthfeel is a little heavier than medium, just about right for the style in my opinion. Though it is quite syrupy, each sip ends crisply. It can be a little boozy, but drank appropriately, this is a true pleasure. This is quite a satisfying beer. You won't be disappointed!"
"O - this is one of the best examples of the style around and definitely worth seeking out, especially if you are a fan of IPA's. Great job, Surly!"
"O - Well deserved praise for the Abrasive Ale. Well crafted and very intense yet approachable."
"Overall: An incredible DIPA. Packed to the brim with citrus grapefruit flavor."
"O- Truly an amazing DIPA one of the best out there, incredibly refreshing and delicious."
"O: So much goodness in a can. I'm in heaven. A home run for Surly. My only wish is that this one was produced year round."
"Thanks to Spdkilz for this one. Another I've been dying to try. Poured from a pint can into my N'ice Chouffe goblet. Nice golden, amber, mosquito catching color. About a finger of white head with pretty great lacing. Smells of citrus up front, a hint of onion BO funk (in a good way), some sweet malt. Nice bright, sweet citrus on the palate. Sticky funky mango. Very bitter dry finish. This tastes amazing. Mouth is very dried out. Sticky. Little creamy bubbles attacking my tongue. Epic."
"O: Easily one of the best IIPAs out there, delicious and refreshing from start to finish, wonderfully crafted beer from surly, cheers to you!"
"Wow! Pleasantly surprised. Pours a dark Orange with nice head. Aroma was absolutely fantastic. Lots of citrus upfront and hops on the finish. Fantastic balance and flavor profile. Another beer I wish was available in Florida. Love the can and all that u get inside!"
"Wow, This is right up there with PTE, maybe better. Definately one of the best Imperial IPA's Ive ever had, not to bitter and the 10% is very well hidden, I could drink this all day long and then some. If you love IPA's, you have to have this."
"Overall - Who has 3 more 16oz cans of this in his refrigerator? THIS GUY. Very happy I was finally able to try this and will for sure trade for it in the future. A fantastic DIPA and extremely easy to quaff. No alcohol taste or warming. It goes down like nothing. Abrasive has lived up to the hype in my opinion."
"Can. I remember having 16 Grit from a growler before but unfortunately I didn't rate it so this will have to do. Canned on 3/09/11 and sampled on 4/6/11. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a darker, slightly haze, honey apricot color with a nice, full, sticky light tan head that coats the glass with lace as it settles. Pungent, musky aroma of hops in the nose of the citrus variety; with mainly orange and grapefruit undertones. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. At first sip I was wondering where the hop bitterness was but then BAM! it hits you towards the middle/end like a freight train. Well balanced though with a sweet malty feel in the beginning. Bitterness lingers on but not in an unpleasant way. Does it really get better than this?"
"Overall: One of my favorite beers. Citrusy Sweet with some great hoppy/bitter notes. Easy to drink, hard to find."
"O- Another winner from Surly. The smell won be over at first sniff. The taste is there, just not as great as the smell, which would be near impossible. Not sure I would want more than one drink at a time. The abv is just high enough that two would make be good and tipsy and I wouldn't appreciate the second as much as I should."
"The aroma of this beer was the best part. The taste was good, but the smell was the tops for any DIPA I've tasted. I would love to try it on tap some time."
"D- I cannot say enough about Surly's brews. Abrasive ale is spot on with the other brews. This is incredibly tasty with the alcohol almost distant. This is one highly recommended DIPA. IF SURLY EVER CAME TO SYRACUSE, I WOULD LOSE MY MIND!!!!"
"O: Overall this was a treat of an Ipa, The fruity flavors were well balanced with pine and hop notes as well as a decent malt backing that evened this abrasive beast out. I will be seeking out more in the future."
"Overall, a nice offering from Surly. I prefer some of their other beers (I'm looking at you, Bender), but this is definitely something I could drink a few of if it were readily available. When fresh, one of the better IPAs out there...really love this one compared to the other Midwest big-names (Hopslam, Double Trouble, etc)."
"Pours cloudy orange/amber with a smallish, white head which dissipated into a coating or less. There is some light lacing all the way through. Nose is grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest and mango, with pine and floral notes. As others have said, the nose of this beer never quits. The taste is grapefruit, some sweet caramel malt, brown sugar and honey . The finish is dry and mildly bitter, but refreshingly so. Warning, wow, there is no sense of the ABV on the way down. Mouthfeel is medium to light with a wonderful crispness, medium carbonation, and only slightly sticky. For those who still think great things can't come in a can, I offer this as definitive evidence. All-in-all, this is a great DIPA and one i would love to have regular access to."
"Overall: Give me more! I wish Surly was availble by me. If I am ever in Minnesota at the right time I will stock up on this! I thought Furious was great but Abrasive blows it out of the water."
"Overall this is a fantastic beer. I love the aroma on this one and the flavor makes it a top notch DIPA. I hope I can try this on draft someday since I've come to realize that is how most DIPA's truly shine. That being said I would never be upset to get more of this. A fantastic beer that I think I will seek out when it is re released next year."
"Mouthfeel is good for the style - crisp, slightly sticky, very dry finish, and a bit of harshness from the bitterness. This beer happens to do the dry part very well but the sticky part not as well - but the dryness wins out for sure. Drinkability is helped a lot by that dryness as it's the last thing the palate feels here. Intense aromas remain throughout the beer and flavors are fine as the beer warms. I had a tough time making the glass last, as the awesome dryness at the end of sips was too much to make me resist another swig. Wasn't let down by this beer, and look forward to trading for it on an annual basis."
"Thanks to joshuaseresse for opportunity."
"Overall a great iipa. The tastes jump out of the glass and smack you in the mouth. Fruity and Bitter just like I like em. I want to say balanced but even the sweet is bitter. A specific flavor profile done right."
"This beer is definitely worth seeking out and makes me wish Surly distributed in PA. An absolutely fantastic DIPA in its own regard."
"DB- Drinks well for how big it is and the amount of hops. The onion thing is a bit odd but I still enjoy this beer."
"Poured into a Surly glass a very nice cloudy golden orange color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some nice sweet malt notes, lots of citrus, and a nice touch of pine. The taste is awesome, very hoppy, with a nice blend of malts for sweetness, citrusy. Medium Body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Very Drinkable, this has got to be one of the best DIPAs have had to date. Thanks Luc!"
"From a can into a chalice, it pours a clear dark amber with a cream color head. Nice lacing is left behind. The aroma is a bold honey or tangerine blossom tinged with the sweetness of peach. Hefty, yet well balanced, in taste with floral and citrus hops leading the way, caramel and a good bite at the end. Mouthfeel is heavy and satisfying as the flavor lingers. Overall, Abrasive is a hell of a Double IPA with exceptional balance and drinkability."
"D/O- What a delicious brew! Alcohol is well hidden making this pint-sized can no match. For as much hype as Hopslam gets, I'd have to give Abrasive the nod over it. #1 DIPA in the land? This would get plenty of votes and rightfully so. """When in Minnesota and you got a drinking quota.""""
"Overall: Well the drinkability...haha...i mean Overall, this beer is really memorable. For the hop heads among us, who are looking for a bigger beer, with a big hop profile devoid of big sweetness or chewiness, this is definitely worth searching out. I will certainly search this out in the future."
"I'm glad to be trying this brew having heard such great things about it from everyone else. it pours a mostly clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises onion, strong mint, parsley, and some light caramel basking in the background. The taste holds notes of orange peel, cilantro, very light onion, black pepper, greens, very light caramel, light pine, and light mint. The body straddles the line between heavy light and light medium, with a mild carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA. It's a bit unbalanced toward the hops, but it never becomes o'erwhelming in that direction."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a bone white head on the surface. The nose smells like a hop plant there is some pine cone in that hop smell and a hint of malt in the background. The first taste and holy god hops. There was the initial mouthfull of terroir was potent, but subsequent sips are much less """abrasive""". There is a pretty decent flavor to it as well, there is a sweet caramel malt flavor behind the bitter hops. The hops are really nice, and actually finish as a minty flavor. This mouthfeel isn't problematic to the palate in the slightest. Overall this is an excellent beer. I'm glad that I have this in my glass right now."
"O - This is by far one of the best examples of an Imperial IPA. This experience reminds me of the first time i had the pleasure of sampling Pliny. Its kinda eye opening. I cant plead enough for Surly to distribute this to California. I would give up many of our wonderful beers to have this on a regular basis."
"O: Overall, a phenomenal DIPA. Definitely the most grapefruit-forward I've had and probably my second favorite DIPA. Amazing, amazing beer."
"O - Probably my new favorite DIPA because I'm a citrus hop fan. Grapefruit and lemon pack a huge punch, but you don't get that """tired palate""" syndrome like some DIPA's cause. Perfect malt background, good aroma, decent mouthfeel...this is a solid beer with a great taste."
"O: Damn. I have found a non-West Coast DIPA that swings for the fences. I'd put this up against any IPA I've ever had, and happily drink with regularity were that possible (only one can...). Someone send me more!"
"As an aside, I am thinking that if I could get this silly fresh, the taste score would come closer to the smell score."
"Overall consistent with a very well aged barleywine, except with hops still in your face, and the alcohol still hidden. If I could I would drink a 4 pack a night...but I'd probably lose my job. This beer lived up fully to my expectations. I want more, more, and more. Period. What else can I say?"
"If you like a tongue bruising hop bomb then this is definitely drinkable. This is a very good representation of the style, but what else would you expect from Surly? In my opinion this is a great example of what kind of various flavors you can get from hops. I am going to go out on a limb here and rate this as one of the five best Imperial IPAs I ever had, due to flavor and drinkability. If you are a alpha acid, hop head like me this is a beer that you will need to find or trade for. Again, I want to give a big thanks to Corey for hooking me up with this special treat becuase it was worth every last drop."
"D: Can't even tell this is 9%, damn. This is another very tasty brew from Surly. Very drinkable."
"D: Bitter and sweet with a good dose of grapefruit. I liked it overall, but I've had better. There is nothing wrong with this DIPA though, and after three of them I'm feeling like I could keep drinking more! Thanks again Chris for sending me a handful of these!"
"Light, smooth mouthfeel pretty similar to HopSlam. Alcohol well-hidden."
"Abrasive is much more approachable than its name suggests. Nice, caramelly maltiness paired with inviting hops. Good stuff."
"D: Goes down easily, very tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick and a great representation of style. This is a ridiculously drinkable DIPA. No alcohol is remotely detectable and the taste is phenomenal. This beer could definitely get me in trouble!"
"Another thank you to UMNbeerhunter for providing one of my bigger IIPA wants. This exceeded my expectations and is now one of my favorite beers I've had."
"D - Incredibly drinkable. Nearly perfect."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is moderate with lively carbonation. Nice long lasting bitterness. This beer is drinking fantastically and I wish I had a case of it. I could drink this beer all night long."
"O - It's not quite as wonderful smelling as a fresh Heady-Topper or a Pliny the Elder but it is very close. To me it tastes on par with these other two brews. It has more balancing malt/fruit than the Heady-Topper, more abrasive bitterness than the Pliny (the most balanced), and more pine than either of them. Great stuff, any way you slice it."
"Drinkability -- Pretty damn good, depending on your opinion toward Simcoe. Anyone who associates Simcoe with cat piss, or liver and onions - don't bother with this one. For the rest of us, this is an incredible DIPA that tastes like a bigger, juicier Furious. Not my favorite DIPA ever, but certainly another EPIC IPA from Surly."
"An exceptional brew from Surly. Much better than Furious in my opinion."
"Great mouthfeel, nice and bubbly."
"D- If I can buy this near me I would buy it all the time. Big hoppy beer that goes down easily. The 9% ABV is not noticeable at all."
"Finish: Sticky, dark hoppy grapefruit sticks to the cheeks and lips"
"I really enjoyed this beer from the start. After the initial pour a beautiful white head appeared about an 1/8 of an inch above the glass. It faded rather quickly, but left a nice lacing around the brim. Has an intense smell of piney hops, which I really enjoy. The taste is almost identical to the smell, very bitter, but in a good way. The drinkability on this one is pretty high considering the 9% ABV. I could easily put down a 4-pk of these, but I wouldn't recommend driving afterward."
"Drinkability: I could drink this bad boy all of the time. Lives up to the hype."
"Overall I am just blown away. This rivals the best of the DIPAs and is probably the best DIPA just behind PtE. Amazingly good. I just wish this brewer could ship stuff outside their state so everyone could realize just how damn good these beers are. Furious and Abrasive might just be the best IPA/DIPA combo made today. Wow, just wow. Lucky for me I still have 3 more to enjoy. Stellar."
"3/6/15 - Well, the cans are available here, and expensive. But, this is everything I described a few years back and maybe even more. A monster IIPA that highlights Citra and Warrior hops in perfect balance with a full body enhanced by the oatmeal. Falls somewhere between Hopslam and Haymarket's Mathias as the best imperial IPA in the upper Midwest."
"Nice amount of carbonation with smooth drinking. The ABV is right on for the style. I could drink this on the regular but it's definitely not an easy one to acquire."
"This is a delicious hop bomb just wish it had a bit more body to chew on then it would be perfect."
"Drinkability: The 9% ABV and the size of the can (16oz) are the only two reasons why this beer doesn't earn a perfect score for drinkability. I love the smoothness of the hops, and the little bit of maltiness lets you know this is still a beer, but there's no debate over what style this precious liquid is that's gracing your tongue. Awesome extra Joe!"
"Great body and carbonation really round out a beer that I could drink all day."
"Impression: All my words are superfluous, except these ---> Do you like IIPA's? If so, get this beer, you will f***ing love it!"
"A beautiful sweet treat. This will round out my top 3 IIPA's of all time. IF anyone can ship cases I will be willing to trade. Thanks to shir0043."
"D: I'd drink the hell out of this... I want some more Rob!"
"There is a reason this beer is world renown and highly sought after, it's really f*cking good! Big juicy peach & tangerine nose makes way for a damper'd bitter grapefruit. Big sexy mouthfeel keeps you interested as this beauty starts cold, but warms in your hands. I could have drank this all night, really. I poured a few sips for a couple of friends and they all wanted more of it, bad, but it was all mine! Too bad we can't get this in WI yet."
"Was too easy to drink! A solid auburn/golden color. Nice 2 finger head, due to a quick pour... Guess I was too eager to try it... Definitely hugs your entire mouth. A balanced blend of fruity/citrusy hops with a solid malt backing. I'm not sure how long I sipped it, but I know that I'd like another!"
"Drinkability is high on this one for me. I wish this was one of Surly's year around. I love this beer."
"D: So crisp and fruity I want more and more. This one has quickly pushed its way up there in my books. The only thing stopping it from a perfect score here is the fact that well...it actually is 9% even though you would never know."
"D- This is a great IIPA. It is rich and creamy. One of, if not the best smelling beers I've encountered. The sweetness is really mellow and delightful, not overpowering. If you are going to bomb out your pallet for the night, this is the beer to grab."
"The resiny notes are really the defining aspect of this beer, but without becoming the only characteristic to be found. The ABV is very well blended."
"If I had ready access to this and Furious, I don't think I would need any other IPAs/DIPAs in the regular rotation."
"Overall, this is a delicious and complex beer which is very well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Although it's bursting with sweet fruit flavor, it's not one-dimensional by any means, with an excellent compliment of dry earthy bitterness, subtle malt and alcohol heat. On par with some of the best west coast IPAs and very similar in flavor profile."
"Drinkability: I love this stuff out of the can, and it's even better on tap. Delicious! Could drink this all night long, but at 9% ABV, I stopped after three pints. Had to drive home eventually that night."
"Update 3/9/11: Upon consuming the second can, I cannot leave this score as it is. Drinkability goes up to 4.5 because of the lack of alcohol, loads of sweet mango and peach hops, and downright easy drinking."
"A great beer, although side by side with Furious(Surly's year round IPA) in my liquor store I'm inclined to go with Furious. Definitely something I will pick up once per year when it is available, and possibly something I will come back to once I try a few more Double IPAs."
"On tap at Stub and Herbs. Pours a golden tan with a silky tan head. Nose has nice piney hops and bready malts. Well balanced, but not as vibrant as I was expecting. Crisp, clean body. Nice hoppy finish. Far from the original 16 Grit, but a tasty double IPA."
"Just an altogether excellent beer from Surly. I really liked the Furious, but would take Abrasive any day of the week over that excellent beer. Just delicious..."
"D- Awesome beer. Very excited that I got a 4 pack of this! Very good DIPA that I would drink again for sure!!"
"The reveal: Surly Abrasive! Kick ass, this is another big want. I really wish I could drink this stuff all the time."
"A hop forward DIPA with some balance. I can enjoy one can in a sitting anymore might burn a hole in the gut."
"Relative Review: One part Short's Spruce Imperial Pilsner (for the nose) to three parts Moylan's Hopsickle, plus a dozen or more IBU's."
"A thick IIPA, not at all dry. Beautiful balance, but didn't exactly showcase the hops like I tend to prefer. There are absolutely no flaws in this beer. I tend to see surly as a company that must have tremendous qc in place, think sierre nevada, but smaller and more adventureous."
"D. If you like a tongue bruising hop bomb then this is definitely drinkable. This is a very good beer, but what else would you expect from Surly. This is a very flavorful showcase of the flavors that hops can provide. Definitely reminds me of Furious. I would say this is pretty close to Furious' big brother. One of my top 5 DIPAs."
"D: Goes down easy. Pretty straightforward DIPA, but interesting enough. Could certainly put away a few of these. ABV nowhere to be found."
"m/d - Very nicely done double ipa, but a bit overly hopped on the taste for me. The nose was just right, but the taste was a bit bitter for me compared to some of the other double ipas I've had and loved. Easy drinker for the ABV."
"Easily drinkable for a 2XIPA. Not as bitter as I had hoped for, but extraordinarily drinkable in many other ways. The bitterness becomes more noticeable as you continue drinking. I had a small sample of this when I attended the February 5th at Jackie O's and really enjoyed the few sips I had. I was able to get a full can thanks to AwYeh and give this one a full review."
"D: Quite an enjoyable beer, I could easily have a couple of these at a time based on the merits of its top-notch hop flavors."
"Drinkability: I consider Furious one of the best IPAs in the country, and Abrasive steps it up a notch. This is an excellent beer, and I really wish Surly distributed to Wisconsin so I could buy their beer on a more regular basis."
"(One unrelated note: had side-by-side with Hopslam at a SB party, this one was king)."
"D- If I could get this where I am in NY... This would be my go to brew. Really nice balance. I'm a happy and hoppy man tonight! Damn... even my burps are citrusy and delicious!!! LOL!!!"
"This is it. This is hands-down the best DIPA I've tried to date. Even though the new year recently began, I see Abrasive easily being one of the best of the year for me."
"I am not generally a fan of IPAs or DIPAs, but this one is so good it's made me reconsider that opinion."
"Drinkability is good. This is a well crafted brew and probably my favorite hop forward beer from Surly besides Wet. I could easily do a can of this anytime and the 9% ABV is essentially unnoticeable. Maybe not my favorite hop profile for a DIPA, but I can see why it averages an A rating. Nice work Surly. Here's to hoping your brewery expansion goes through. Cheers!"
"I wish this brew were around these parts. I would certainly reach for more of it."
"My first beer from Surly and I must get more!"
"From notes - Amazing golden orange color that highlights tiney bubbles that rush towards a puffy white two finger head. This head leaves some spotty lacing as the beer retreats. The aroma is madening, both citrusy orange, lemon, grapefruit and tropical fruits ride a wave of more earthy and piney hops underneath. The flavor is crisp and clean, tropical, citrusy, and sweet withough being cloying. Perfect grain bill, too much crystal sometimes kills an ipa, here it is great, muted yeast charecter, clean. Is it the oat? Chewy and full mouthfeel just shy of too much. This is one of my top three favorit x2ipa's period."
"Big thanks goes out to optimator13 for this one from the Small Aquatic Mammal BIF '11! Served from can into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a two and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, bitter hop, and slight wild onion. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, garlic, and mild onion. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The onion flavor I detected on this one reminded me of all the good memories I have of Gunba. There was an excellent aroma and well balanced hoppy bitterness going on in this one. This is an absolute must try and totally worth seeking out."
"I am actually glad this is seasonal, because it might just be the end of me if I could find it year-round for a reasonable fee."
"I can see why this gets such good reviews. This might be one of my new favorite DIPAs."
"O: really like this beer. It reminds me of knuckle sandwich and double jack; more malt than hops, but in a good way."
"Atmosphere is very good. Really nice deep golden hue, bubbly head, carbonation throughout and some decent lacing. Nose is very full combination of pine, sweet and spice. Flavor is an interesting balance of pine, sweet, and spice. Kinda' tastes like it smells. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"A very solid dipa, though i can't say it's my favorite."
"D-this is a big IPA with some great hop presence and nice bitterness that ends abruptly. Tasty and drinkable stuff with just a hint of alcohol in the finish."
"I like this beer...a lot. Thanks Brian!"
"M/D: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Definitely on the creamier side. Left my mouth dry with a slight bitter flavor. Overall, quite drinkable, but I am surprised that it wasn't as hoppy as expected."
"Very high. I can only curse the ABV and price tag... this is one I could drink for as long as it's available to me. As an IPA, this is superior."
"Appearance, good color, good head. Smell, strong hoppy smell. Taste, starts with enough hops to peels your tounge off, but backed with some good strong malts. Mouthfeel, kinda watery, low carbonation kinda brings this down. Drinkability. I liked it, and wouldn't shy away from drinking it again. I'm not really a hoppy guy so that surprised me, and makes me want to try more."
"Thanks for bringing this one over Chris! Poured from can into NB globe, golden color, slightly orange, small white head that settles to a collar. Smells amazing, huge pine hop aroma, slightly fruity with a bit of malty sweetness. Taste is a good balance of tropical fruit hops, pineapple, with a good malt backbone and a slightly sweet finish. Medium to heavy body and a light carbonation. Overall a very good, balanced double IPA, one of my favorite surly beers."
"D - I am surprised how much I like this beer given that I tend to like hop-forward IPAs and this one is definitely malt dominated. Maybe my palate is changing..."
"West coast IIPA are insanely good, but the east coast has a fare share of loaded barrels. Hop bomb smashed right in my face with this amazing ABRASIVE ALE. Take that and come for more:)"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is in between light and medium bodied, with nice fine carbonation. It is very smooth going down. Probably not quite as good in this category as a couple other that I've tried, but still good. I wish I had access to this beer (and all Surly beers) all the time. I would be most satisfied, because this is a phenomenal beer."
"Drink- A hidden gem from MN. Surly does some great brews. very well done with huge flavors across the board."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange with and inch of foam that quickly faded leaving some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a mix of fruit notes, orange, mango, pineapple and pine backed by a nice malty backbone. Taste is malty sweet with some of the mango and orange fruit flavors coming through toward the not very bitter finish. Nicely carbonated and medium bodied, this is very easy to drink and enjoy with just a hint of the 9% alcohol in the finish. Nicely done. Can't beat a can."
"There is nothing abrasive about this at all (unintended pun). A huge juicy hop character along the lines of Masala Mama and the like. Excellent and highly recommended."
"Pours a medium orange with a couple of fingers of white head.  Smells citrusy, piney, tons of hops, smells delicious!  I taste hops at the front, some citrus and some pine hops.  It also tastes sweet, a lot of flavor but smooth and really good.  Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is really high."
"This beer is far too drinkable for the ABV and if it were sold in CA Id drink it all the time."
"I would definitely like to get a fresh off the canning line version of this beer, but this is still quite fresh and vibrantly hoppy. Given that this is at least a month old at this point, it is lasting pretty well in the can; I would guess that it holds up better than Pliny does in its bottle. I am not sure that I like this more than fresh Pliny though, it has a bit too much garlic chive flavor and aroma to it (thought thankfully this is held to a low enough level that I am still thoroughly enjoying this beer)."
"So new category: nosefeel: 5.0 :)"
"Huge thanks to Justin for including this beer as an extra in our trade! Poured easily for a 1.5-finger head that holds true for several minutes, color is clear amber-orange, lacing is super-sticky with very small bubbles....just like most Surly canned beers! Aroma is loaded with fresh pineapple, grapefruit, honey, and a slight sting of pine. Taste of perfectly-balanced malt/hop profiles. Flavors of tropical fruit carry over to the taste. Leaves a fruity-bitterness on the palate between tastes. The pineappley-hops are enormous. This is one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Thank God it's fresh! Thanks Justin!"
"Medium bodied beer with carbonation that gently scrubs your tongue of the sticky sweetness, leaving a lightly bitter lingering citrus and herbal hoppiness. Dangerously drinkable DIPA as the alcohol is very well hidden despite being 9.0%. I had to keep myself from drinking a pint of it up quickly."
"D-highly drinkable. Was suprised ar the abv!"
"Thanks to cmswoboda for the opportunity to try this one. Served at 49 degrees in a tulip. Pours a translucent burnt red/orange with a latte-like one inch cap. Head eventually dissipates into a solid skim, with swaths and spots of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals sweet citrus notes and a touch of slightly herbal, bitter rind. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tropical fruit seems to be co-mingled in the flavor profile. Finish is slightly bitter, but does not linger. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly oily consistency and a crisp, even carbonation. There's also a slight astringency that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. A top notch DIPA with great balance and just the right amount of complexity. I can't get enough from this Brewer."
"A very smooth, fruity DIPA. Ranks up there with Two Hearted and Furious for me. Delicious."
"D - Great beer. Easily drink a bunch of this stuff."
"This was great. Need to get back to MN to get more!"
"Freaking Abrasive! Much love to freshmanpour77 (awesome trader) for hooking me up with this one (fresh). Ton of hops up front, carbonation spot on. Tried this by myself and was blown away, tried it with a friend the next go around and we were both amazed. We tried it again for a third time this Saturday next to Pliny (very fresh) and Abrasive was the preference of 3 of the 4 people at the tasting. It is amazing how this beer changes over just a week time with it tasting best the first (freshest). Looking forward to my next try of this amazing beer."
"Poured from a 16oz can dated 12-29-10. Pours clear dark orange with one finger white head. Aroma was impressive. Loaded with dank hops and tons of citrus. Flavor was loaded with bitter hops, but lacking all the citrus (I'm picking up mostly orange here) and a good malt back bone. Abrasive is a good name for this brew as if you don't like a ton of bitter hops than this one might not be for you. Mild carbonation going on. Solid beer but a bit of a disappointment based on other rankings."
"D - Very High. I really enjoyed this one. The balance of hops, sweetness, and creamy feel is nearly flawless. Easily the best IPA I have ever had out of a can. I look forward to having this again in the future."
"Overall I would say this beer is better than Hopslam but not better than Heady topper or elder/younger or sculpin. This is an awesome IPA that I will be trading for more."
"Drinkability: There is no doubt that I could drink this all night, even though my tongue might not have taste buds by morning. This is an appropriate step up from Furious, which to date is my favorite IPA. There is potential for improvement, but this is a solid offering."
"Overall it is a great double IPA. To be honest, I'd rather be drinking a Furious. I think it is more balanced and more enjoyable. I'm sure others might disagree."
"D:The drink on this was ridiculous for 9%. Big hop flavors with easy drink which you really couldn't ask for more out of this drink. Could drink this one all the time and would if it was available, lets start some outside distributing Surly!!"
"D - It's printed in the bottle a ton of malts and hops were used. I believe it. They must have used a ton of malt to keep up with all those hops. I've never drank 16 oz of a 9 percent DIPA so fast. I LOVE SURLY."
"For 9%, this drinks waaay too easy. I could enjoy this all night."
"D: Absolutely Drinkable, not to drink fast, but could definately drink a couple to say the least! Abrasive's Explosive! ;)"
"D - Drinkability is high. The alcohol is masked nicely and the nose and flavor just have me constantly coming back for me. It's smooth as well, which really helps. I need to find myself a 4-pack of this!"
"D - This is delicious. Worth the price in every way."
"D- This will easily be one of my favorite brews of the year. Glad maximum12 sent me 4 ... I cannot see myself letting go of them! By far my favorite surly brew to date."
"Abrasive cracks with a hiss and pours into the Founders pint glass looking bright bronze with a deep orange color all around. A nice amount of foam up above that settles into a nice cap, rings around the glass. Smell is hop forward and malty in the back. A big blast of citrus, mango, pineapple, the works with oranges, a lot of those. A bready sweet biscuit as well. Taste is superb, really gets the essence of west coast hop bombs. To me though, this mostly reminds me of a lot of Port Brewing hoppy offerings. A whole bunch of orange and mango flavor in here backed by some sweet bready type yeast and light malts. Other tropics after that. Im really liking the feel here, it kinda tears through a layer of my mouth on the first few sips, than eases up with a mix of hops than light malt. Carb is great out da can, a medium body. I could not get down big gulps of this stuff for some reason. I usually tear through DIPA's, I had to take a laid back approach to this one. A top notch DIPA that gets that west coast loving."
"Drinkability: Powerful stuff. Delicious. I didn't get any sense of the 9% ABV, but the sheer cornucopia bounty of the flavorful hop profile should, should, limit me to one pint a night. Well done."
"Notes: Very good. Certainly up there with some of the better DIPAs I've had. Apparently this is brewed with oats. That explains the great head retention and mildly silky mouthfeel."
"upon appearance, the head is thin and wafting but the bubbles get me excited. The smell is citrus, grapefruit heaven that makes me salivate...the hops are overwhelming...my god, can this taste anywhere near as good as it smells...Yes, it can...and even better! My mouth wants to gulp, but my brain tells me to savor this brew ( I only have 4 after all). This will be my first beer of the night for the next 3 nights...I want not to lay waste to my palate with this most exceptional brew...my goodness! Tangy, sweet, and a bitter pounding that makes me want to bless myself w/ this nectar...thou shall not waste abrasive ale. Seek ye the ale that is abrasive and ye shall have everlasting peace!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a very solid brew that I really enjoyed. It is well balanced, smells wonderful and easy drinking, very easy drinking for 9%. I love a good hoppy beer that encompasses an array of flavor without displaying just sheer bitterness. Well done Surly and big big thanks Heath for sharing this with me."
"Thanks to brewnic. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter, deep orange with a 2""" white head, nice lacing. The beer has a ton of pine and grapefruit on the nose. The first sip hits you with lots of pine, grapefruit and tropical fruit in the background. The beer is plenty bitter, as per my wife, and has a lingering piney finish. The body is medium and it has a sticky feel to it. A fine DIPA, worth seeking out."
"Dangerously drinkable DIPA, simple as that."
"D- well god damn this is a killer beer. Hands down one of the best dipas I've ever had. This fillie can run with the best of em and maybe take the whole thing. The name fits, it is abrasive and it will settle the hop fiend in you but so nicely balanced that you can enjoy a few for sure."
"The CPJ"
"The good flavor balance and complete lack of detectable alcohol make for a ridiculously drinkable DIPA."
"D: Awesome stuff. I love this beer."
"I really have no witty commentary to finish this one up with just a big THANK YOU to Surly. For Christ's sake come to PA, or just distribute to my house like once a month please."
"I originally had a growler of this (as 16 Grit) almost exactly 2 years ago and finding me back with this beer was like reuniting with an old friend. Wow, is this DIPA full flavored, well balanced, and deceptively drinkable for the size. I honestly think that I enjoyed this even more the second time around with it. There are a LOT of fantastic examples of the style out there right now but this one definitely stands tall. It's definitely the best example of a DIPA in a can anyway!"
"overall - very tasty. this would be a fun one to age and see what happens. I feel the 9%, but don't taste it. very drinkable."
"This is just too good of a beer to not seek out! Way too drinkable and I'm only upset that I can't get more. The only flaw (if you can call it that) is that its very sweet. Though, the description says it's 'under-brewed' so I'm sure that's what they were going for."
"This beer most definitely deserves the reputation it has as one of the best DIPAs out there. It's of the west coast style, which supplements the hoppiness with citrus instead of malt, and it's done to perfection. I want to move to Minnesota so I can load up on it every winter."
"Comments: Very thrilled to have a fresh Abrasive. My next step is to do a side by side with a Furious to note the major differences."
"Nice medium body, decent carbonation, a little sticky and dry in the feel. Drinks great for a DIPA, and the alcohol is nearly undetectable. Excellent job by Surly once again."
"Edit: After consideration, and trying Hopslam, I'm bumping my ratings for this beer. It's the best DIPA I've ever had."
"Review Edited, +.5 to smell, +.5 to mouthfeel."
"I waited a while for this beer and it was well with it. Well done Surly!"
"D: Refreshing and a very solid beer. I could drink quite a bit of this."
"D- Could easily put down a couple of four packs in one sitting, ridiculously easy to drink. When this is fresh, as it is, it is easily as good as Pliny... Enjoy if you are lucky enough to find this beer."
"Jesus....had this beer several times but never reviewed it. The appearance is good but not special. A nice amber orange with a small head. The smell is transcendent. Such a ripe, juicy aroma of tropical fruits and pine. Splendid. The taste is the nectar of amazing citrus and tropical fruit hops. Almost like Hi-C Ecto Cooler (in a good way). So delicious and smooth, a bit of malt to hold it together, but not much. The mouthfeel is good. The drinkability is out of this world. So easy to just down this shit like its a fruit juice cocktail on a beach. A world class DIPA. Amazing."
"Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium but it's nice and sticky with some moderate carbonation. Waaaay too drinkable... literally... I am enjoying this way too much and I'm down to my last couple of sips... I'll definitely track this one down again next time it's out."
"This beer pours an orange-red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is strong enough that it leaps out of the glass, and can be detected feet away. Mandarin oranges, peaches, grapefruit, hibiscus, and pollen are all present in copious amounts. This is one beautiful smelling beer. The taste is pure hop juice. The bitterness isn't as firm as a lot of other DIPAs I've tasted which allows the hop flavors to show themselves more clearly. All aspects of the aroma are present in the taste with the addition of a nice soft earthiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely search out again, and again."
"Overall - one of the best beers I have had in awhile, and I am having some more shipped out to me STAT!"
"This beer pours a copper color, almost light amber with a white head. The aroma is complex! Very piney with hints of citrus. I love the hop character in this beer. The mouthfeel is medium to medium light, and is very drinkable. For a beer at 9% the alcohol isnt noticeable."
"This is a well made beer. Anyone can throw a shit-ton of hops into a brew kettle, but it takes true skill to craft a beer that is this hoppy, and yet still so drinkable. Truly delicious."
"This is Definitely my favorite Double IPA."
"Great Imperial IPA but watch your beer budget if wanting this one."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An outstanding Double IPA. One of the best I have been fortunate enough to drink."
"Two day old Abrasive - you can't beat that. This one pours a nice amber with a good head on it. The smell is very much grapefruit and sweet malt. The flavor a also very much grapefruit/tropical fruit with a little bit of malt to back it up - but that's not the point of this one - it's a hop bomb. The tropical fruit and seet malt keep it light and not too bitter. As it warms the malt pokes out a bit more and a hint of alcohol comes on. It tastes quite a bit like a bigger version of Wet, which is one of my favorites. The mouthfeel is the only downfall to this brew, I was expecting a bit more body to it though I guess that might be expecting everything to be perfect. However, this is a very refreshing brew and not so ovewhelming that I could have 2-3, although the big ABV is a bit limiting. A great beer and probably the most Cali DIPA this side of the rockies."
"First time i had it and it knocked me off my feet (flavor wise not the 9% ABV) not at all what i was expecting very good and even better because i won it in a bet"
"I dont want to sound like I am bashing this beer, just expected more. It is good and definitely worth trying if you are a hop head"
"An extremely easy drinking beer, but for the ABV. Mostly soft and pleasant on the senses, although I like my IPAs mean. Overly fruity for my tastes but what's worse are the discordant onion-garlic notes. That said, it's a straight up DIPA. A very good beer and highly recommended if fruity IPAs are your thing."
"D: Hides the abv, though the flavor is intense enough that it may not be too sessionable. Well, I take that back. It's delicious. I could have a ton of these."
"D - Very, very good. Really easy to drink. Delicious DIPA that I wish I could drink all the time. Awesome job on the smell and flavors for this one, Surly. I'm glad they canned it again this year and hope they do it more in the future."
"Serving type: can poured into a Surly pint glass."
"D: The overall drinkability is incrediable. I wish I could buy this all year round. It is too bad that it is only brewed once a year. If you have not tried Abrasive and you are a hop head this beer should then be on the top of your wants list."
"This is a beautiful beer. Get some."
"D - It's a bit more intense than Furious, but I love it. Some people may not want to drink a beer this intense for a whole session or on a regular basis, but I would love to drink Abrasive on the reg."
"D - Three words...Through The Roof! I only wish they distributed in WI because this would be a daily staple in my fridge. Wow! Good stuff!"
"Okay, following the Crack & Glug, I was facing a finger-and-a-half of dense, eggshell-white head with good retention. As it slowly fell, it left behind lacing that may require a chisel to remove. Also, who planted a pine forest in my kitchen? The place smells like I am out in the field with my uncle, the hunter, when I was just a kid. Color was a hazy orangish-amber and that was just fine with me. I have railed repeatedly on the negative aspects of filtration-driven clarity. If it falls bright, so be it, but to manually run a beer through screen to clean it up for the masses reeks of destruction. It strips out character and flavor, like giving me a frontal lobotomy. Maybe that's what they meant by """under-brewed""". The nose was simply mouthwatering. It was like standing in an evergreen forest on a snowy day - cool, biting, fresh, resinous. Mouthfeel was medium but I could feel the grinder against my soft, pink tongue, removing everything in its path to my poor little taste buds, rocked into submission by so many AALs. My sinus cavity began to fill with the scent of industrial-strength pine and my tongue suddenly spontaneously combusted. I tried to put it out with another mouthful of beer, but it was like putting out fires with gasoline. Gah! This is why I got so deeply hooked as a hophead. Does anybody see a screeching monkey on my back all of a sudden? The finish was suddenly mellow, as though my nervous system had been ground down to the nerve endings and I was content to allow the Aeolian Harp to play across my spine. Gasp! A bandsaw blade to my Brain Housing Group might have the same effect. This ain't abrasive, it's downright industrial! I would be afraid to take this in my beach cooler - I'd end up like Bruce Dern at the end of """Coming Home""": stripping off my dress blue uniform and wading into the surf, never to be heard from again. Shee-whack!"
"Poured from the 16 ounce can a deep amber color with a creamy beige head. On the nose, I get a ton of hoppy aromas, pine, orange, grapefruit. On the palate, medium bodied, with a whole assortment of tropical fruits--mango, pineapple, grapefruit--light honey, caramel."
"Drinkability: Pretty hefty but very balanced."
"This beer was great, but I still prefer Furious..Pours a clear orange golden with a large frothy off-white head that leaves nice lacing as it recedes. Aroma is a big dose of hops, including grass, earth, pine/resin, citrus and some rind, along with a hint of caramel. Flavor is sweet on the outset, followed by nicely balanced hops and malt, with spice, pine, grass/earth and more citrus rind and a mild lingering bitterness and some residual warmth. Nice stuff, if not a touch sweet, but still a very nice DIPA."
"SkÅL!"
"D -- Very good beer, solid to the style. More than worth the buy."
"Drinkability: The ABV may be pretty high (and not really noticeable) but if you somehow get your hands on a grip of Abrasive Ale you'll be sure to have a hard time stopping the consumption."
"Blown away despite high expectations, I'm in awe. I reserve the right to up the taste score after trying this fresh next year - it's absolutely stellar now, but giving a 5 is unfair, as I know it'll be even better. Omar, I love you."
"Definitely a piney bitter chop to the throat style DIPA. I'm into that, so solid drinkability in my books."
"Tasted from can obtained from a trade. Pours clear amber orange with a huge white head that is frothy and rocky with excellent retention. Nose is bitter and citrus hops with a great malt backbone and just a hint of bread and yeast. Flavor is bittersweet up front with some caramelization on the middle along with pineapple and other tropical fruits. The hops come in with light lemon and bitterness on the back. The body is medium with average carbonation and a beautiful tropical fruit and bitter finish. This is a first class DIPA."
"Thanks to bauermj for the trade! 16oz can into a Hopus tulip pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice frothy off white head that slowly diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is burnt caramel in front of sharp pine hops. The taste is a nice amount of pine hops just in front of a nice burnt caramel backbone, very nice balance with the hops winning out while not entirely overpowering. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol, quite smooth and refreshing. I must say, this is a very enjoyable DIPA, one I would certainly love to have again."
"This beer is easy to drink initially but seems to build up a head of steam and the palate gets destroyed by the end. ABV is hidden to me and it is very good overall, but difficult to have more than one."
"Another very impressive beer from Surly. The hops have really held up nicely on this, and I can't wait to try it fresh upon the next release."
"D: Very nice DIPA. Not the best I have had, but it is better than most. This was a pleasant surprise. I would def drink this again and glad I got a 4 pack. 9%? Went down easy and was perfect for a nice summer evening."
"Found this on tap at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis. It shines clear and amber with a fair white head that quickly fades to a mere ring with very good lacing. The aroma is a pretty intense, sweet grapefruit/juniper hop with a modicum of raspberry malt bleeding through. Strong and tempting. The first taste is pretty in line with the aroma, somewhat syrupy fruity hops with a fair bready malt undercurrent. It still evokes a curious but likeable juniper/evergreen idea in a medium plus bodied brew. Definitely a brew of solid constitution that demands some appreciation but it hides its 9.5% ABV quite well allowing for decent drinkability for the style. Mild carbonation but a smooth, somewhat thick feel that goes down quite reasonably."
"D - These are too tastey. I wish I could get these in Japan all the time."
"D: A bit much to do too much, but this is a good brew; maybe a bit sweet and alcoholy at times but for the most part this beer works well for what it is"
"Overall: A good DIPA. Not my fave but it is right up there."
"This is a sweeter pretty solid dipa. I would love to try it fresh, but I would take a Surly Furious over this any day."
"Overall, maybe doesn't live up to its hype but a worthy beer."
"Very much on the grapefruit hop edge, with the slightest pineapple twinge . Light body. Very drinkable, watch out you won't be able to pick up the alcohol anywhere near its advertised amount. Great carbonation leads to some tasty burps on this one. The bitterness is just right, didn't ruin any subsequent beers out on the course. A small dose of pine. Citrus moreso though. Tough to keep your hands off this one."
"Drinkability is top notch. Really, a delicious example of the style that is just bursting with hop flavor. Fantastic and addictive."
"This is a wonderfully drinkable double IPA. I am very impressed by this offering. I would have given it a five if the finish had been drier."
"The body on this beer is a disappointment though. Very slick and thin. Expecting a full-bodied beer, the flatness really let me down. Great flavoring of grapefruit, some sweet orange, candied malts (gives it a sweet punch), and a great bitter afterbite. This is a good beer. Tweak that mouth and this is a stellar beer."
"D - This is a decently drinkable DIPA but after a while it got rather cloying to me with how sweet the malts are. It actually could have been a little more crisp in the mouthfeel."
"D-This is one pretty impressive brew. The nose alone makes me want to smell it all day. Not to mention the insane drinkability this 9% beer has. It drinks more like a 6%... be warned."
"Overall a fantastic beer and probably one of my favorites of all time. I just wish I could get it more often!"
"That minor criticism aside, this beer can be summed up with two words and one acronymn: Top. Five. DIPA."
"This beer falls just shy of perfection, but not by a whole lot. An amazing drinking experience that I'd recommend to anyone...hophead, malthead (is that a recognized term here?), anyone...this is a beer you should try. If nothing else, it will show you what a world-class DIPA is all about."
"Very good beer, mouthfeel was a little weird but not at all bad...doesn't drink like a 9.0% beer, would love to try this again..."
"Taste is like biting into a piece of grapefruit peel that has been soaked in vodka and onion juice. Mild earth-tones seem both foreign and belonging at the same time amongst the bright aspects of the beer. Dont get me wrong, the beer is bitter, but there is so much more to offer in terms of hop flavor here...so juicy, piney, resinous and delicious. Had this side by side with Gubna, Abrasive wins cans down. Awesome beer and an awesome DIPA."
"M & D: very good, at 9ABV it's probably something I could have just a few of"
"D - Amazing drinkability, if not for the ABV I could have these all day. This was my first Surly offering, now I can't wait to try some more."
"O: Great beer. Great conversation. Great memories. I can't wait until we meet again."
"Pours a thick, translucent golden amber color with a massive, creamy off white head that has excellent retention and nearly coats the entire glass in lacing. Aroma is pungent and fresh, dominated by tropical citrus and some light floral hops. Body is medium thick, with dine light carbonation. The finish is bitter and hoppy, but not very dry or clean. This isn't a bad thing though since the flavor is a pile of citrusy, primarily grapefruit, hops and a strong balancing malt body. The wet finish lingers with sweet citrus flavors and a slight pinch of alcohol. Overall, a unique over the top yet well balanced DIPA."
"M & D: very good, at 9ABV it's probably something you could have just a few of"
"Flavor follows the aroma """right on the money!""" The hops hit right away, and absorb into the mouthfull of sweet tropical fruits! It's hard to explain, beacause it's not quite like a DIPA, not heavy in malts at all, but the hop sharpness is ever so pleasant! The most common fruit I can pick up, is the grapefruit...and the beer finishes slightly dry and leaves you wanting more. A GREAT IPA for the summer time...thirst quenting! Body is medium to light, perfect medium to high carbonation...and a great drinker! Great IPA from Surly!"
"Very glad I got to try this brew. Thanks for sending this to me Jose. Very good for the IPA lover and good for the malt monster that has been getting into IPA's. Definitely try this brew."
"Surly Abrasive Ale appears clear with a pretty good sized head and decent lacing. There is a very strong pine aroma with hops and citrus coming in behind. The taste is more of what I found in the nose and quite enjoyable. The finish was interesting, in that much more of a malt presence emerged than the aroma would have indicated. Grapefruit and pine are also very notable throughout, and linger on the palate, creating a very pleasant aftertaste. All in all, Abrasive Ale is an excellent DIPA, and certainly one I'd like to have again. And again..."
"Pours a bright orange/copper color into my favorite DFH tulip glass with a big pillowy 2 finger head. Smell is amazing, huge orange, peach, pineapple and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is up there with the smell, big orange, tropical fruits with a some sugary sweetness and a faint malt backing. Smooth, velvety mouth feel with great carbonation. Drinkability is excellent with no hint of alcohol whatsoever. I could put these down all day long if available to me. Fantastic dipa offering from surly. One of the best dipa's I have had and I have had plenty. Highly recommended to the hop heads."
"D- Another hit from Surly. I have yet to have a beer from them that I have not wanted to drink every day."
"(D)- This is good, but far too malty for the style in my opinion. The hop profile is great in the aroma, but in the taste and mouthfeel they are far lacking in presence like they should. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this beer, but I was expecting more for the style it is classified under."
"HV"
"This is a heavy beer and a good one. It would be difficult to drink this beer all night, but is a DIPA suppose to be a session beer?"
"D - great DIPA, as expected from the makers of one of my favorites, Furious. kicks it up a notch with a light alcohol presence and more (subtle) straightforward fruity hop tastes. a fine beer."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again, and recommend this to those seeking a piney hop profile with a tea like profile. Solid brew."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I love it just like I loved Furious and pretty much everything else they brew. Give me a four-pack of these and I'd be a happy camper."
"Poured from a 16oz. can into a snifter glass. Has a nice orange/reddish/copper color with good head retention and high carbonation. Lots of citrus hoppy aroma with some nice caramel and toffee notes. Very malty taste. Caramel malts take over in flavor with some citrus hops and alcohol in the end. Very creamy mouthfeel with some hop bitterness. Me like!"
"Canned sample- pours a glowing tangering, slight haze, minimal head. Nose- ripe tropical fruit rinds, some pine, sweet cookie malts. Taste- hop forward as expected, thick resiny hop feel, spicy and sweet. Malt adds mostly a sweetness aspect to it, as this is all about the hops. Fairly thick creamy body with moderate carbonation. Quite easy drinking which is very dangerous. A four pack would slide down nicely, and likely lead me to being quite abrasive to those around me..."
"5.0 D: Really great brew. Surly does nothing but impress me with what they make and this is no exception. Super smooth with a great taste, I could drink this all night. Well done."
"Golden orange sort of color with a nice tight head. Very floral and has a caramel sweetness that kept wafting my way once poured. even before my first sip a sweet smelling aroma continually came my way. Hop blast upfront. A lot more hop flavor then bitterness. Very flowery tasting-not citrusy or pine like. Oily and sticky mouthfeel that I just love. Very drinkable beer and enjoyable. Abrasive nuthin-smoth as a baby's bottom!"
"I remember being struck by how juicy and fruity the original 16 Grit was, and that memory persists. Massively fruity with pineapple, peach, apricot and a little grapefruit and citrus, this has a ton of hop flavor. Malt flavor is mild, there's a little sweetness. Bitterness is rather low, letting the fruit flavors rise. Drying and fruity on the finish with a great hop character, this beer is medium-light in body with a great level of carbonation (moderate). Creamy on the palate,this beer is a pleasure to drink"
"I don't understand the love the love here."
"The flavor was nicely balanced for a DIPA not a west coast one for sure. The grapefruit bitter was blended with a orange sweetness. It reminded me of a tropical drink and it was quite refreshing. It had a medium feel to it with a ton of carbonation. A great drinking DIPA I would have loved a six pack of this brew but was thankful for the one."
"Overall another great beer from Surly. Not surprising at all. Glad I got the chance to give this one a whirl."
"D- Qutie a bit going on in this one. Very solid brew and easy to drink. I really wish Surly was easier to get for me, but its very solid and easy to drink."
"D - very drinkable, however, this beer's drinkability is slightly limited by the sweetness of the malt backbone. the 9% abv is hidden well."
"D: Very good drinkability. This was quite an enjoyable IPA."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, herbal, and chewy with heavy hop syrup."
"Good drinkability for a DIPA that weighs in at 9%. This is an exceptional DIPA."
"The Abrasive ale pours a deep yellow almost gold color with a nice 2 finger white head and lots of lacing on the glass. Very good start with the pour. Smell is dominated with hops. Some subtle citrus fruit and pine undertones but the aromas are almost pure hops. Taste is unbelievable. Lots of hops but yet very smooth drinking. More of the citrus fruits come through in the quaff. The uniqueness of this beer is that it is bitter up front and has a lingering sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Drinkability is above average. I could drink this brew every night if I were able to. Thanks so much Scotty!"
"D - Ummm...this is way too drinkable. Tons of hop flavor without an overwhelming bitterness. Very, very smooth. This might be the easiest drinking DIPA I've ever had. Very nice beer...glad I have a couple more of these to savor. Thanks again Bill!"
"D: It feels a bit rich, which forces me to slow down and sip. It's not HARD to drink, but this is not a guzzler. I didn't trade for this one, but I'm told it's priced pretty affordably, which makes it more attractive in my book. I prefer the West Coast style more, though, so I don't know if I'll seek a lot of this out in the future. But I do like it."
"D - Surly does a great job again with this beer. This is easily one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. What I love about it is that the hops are so fresh and has such a variance of aroma and flavor. There is too much caramel malt flavor in this beer for my tastes, which is the major knock I have against this beer. Next time I'm going to Minnesota, I'm loading up my car with this."
"Thanks again Chickdighops!"
"D - Pretty good, not sure if I could session it, but it's close. Got through two from the tap with no problem."
"DIPA resin taste that coats your mouth, some heat and an enamel scraper. Damn fine."
"decent double IPA, very enjoyable. at 9%, id rather have a furious."
"Drinkability: This is a damn tasty DIPA, one of the best I've had actually. Plenty of juicy, bitter hops without too much malt getting in the way. Sure, it could use a bit more carbonation, but even so this is really good. The 9% ABV might make it tough to pound all night, but I'd sure give it my best shot. Absolutely recommend!"
"4/4.5/4/4/4.5"
"Full mouthfeel, a bit sticky for my tastes, ok carbonation. I could get through this a little easier with a bit more carbonation, which might lighten it up a bit too. Not terrible, just not perfect on the feel. A good drink--nice to have something that still tastes hoppy when I feel like I've pushed my limits on hops way too far."
"I'm glad I got a chance to try a fresh can of this beer because it certainly did not disappoint. Although I think it could use some more hop bitterness, it's still quite drinkable because it just has so much hop flavor. This may well be a DIPA that you could call 'approachable.' A very tasty beer."
"Truly, an amazing DIPA. A big shout out to Masala Mama for introducing me to yet another remarkable Surly offering. I'm beginning to wonder if this brewery is capable of brewing anything less than world class."
"I don't know if I would enjoy more than a pint of this in an evening, but damn it's tasty."
"Orange-gold pour with a white head. Big citrus, melon and pine aroma with some sweet toffee and biscuit, a hint of floral character. Grapefruit, bubblegum, melon, honey and pine flavor with some sticky sweet caramel. Oily, medium-full body with moderate carbonation."
"A very nice IPA and one I would still like to try on Tap. Almost a touch too sweet."
"D: The 9% is hardly noticeable. Another great one from Surly. At this point I am considering a move to Minnesota just to have regular access to their beer ; )"
"Many thanks to kbutler1 for sending a four pack of this my way. One thing I can say for certain is that the last time I had this (when it was called 16 Grit) is that is got me ever some drunk. Anyway, it comes out a clear orange color, without much of a head. Hops can be detected immediately upon pouring, giving off an herbal and fruity sort of hop flavor. I get notes of pineapple, grapefruit, mint leaf, and sticky resin. Very similar in flavor, with the sweetness and bitterness battling it out throughout the experience. In the end the bitter character has the edge. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and syrupy at times in light of the sweetness. Drinkability is great, but like I said before about my first experience with this brew, be careful, as it will knock you on your ass easily. Overall a pretty damned good DIPA. I am glad they decided to can this, as opposed to discontinuing it all together. Cheers"
"There are so many good, dare I say exceptional, qualities to this beer, it's such a shame that the one flavor brings down and overpowers the best this beer has to offer. This isn't just a super hopped up beer. It's a beer of great complexity and great enjoyment with one glaring distraction. Too bad."
"overall, in interesting DIPA. damn spicy though."
"This beer does not drink like 9 %. A nice beer, but not quite what I had hoped for from a brewery that offers one of my favorite IPA's."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it was an excellent tasting beer. I love IPA's and DIPA's that show a lot of great hoppy flavors but don't show an extreme bitterness, and this one did that very well. Also tasted pretty light considering the abv. Excellent beer overall. Update 2/4/11 increasing aroma from 4 to 4.5 after having some fresh cans tonight. Loved the juicy aroma to it."
"update: have had this several times since, and wow. even while congested the hops jump out. killer aroma. just beautiful all around."
"M: Very slick and smooth."
"Mouthfeel is relatively dry with a high level of carbonation. The bitterness is the only lingering feeling on this beer. I was expecting a bit more from this beer after having Furious, but I still enjoyed it. I'm thinking this beer doesn't hold its freshness as well, so if I try it again, I hope it's right off the canning line."
"very nice dipa, but not really abrasive."
"Seek this one out!"
"Notes: Overall this was a pretty good double-ipa. I was surprised by the sweetness of the drink and that was a bit off-putting to me when coupled with the intense hoppiness: it definitely influenced the drinkability of the beer. In the end I don't think I would buy this one again, for the price ($16 for four cans) it just didn't seem worth it for this double-ipa which didn't particularly 'wow' me in any way."
"This beer pours a very clear gold with a slight orange hue. The head is white, I think it is dropping because of the hotel glass it is in. The smell is awesome, orange rind, pine, grassy, a hint of biscuit, when I opened the can I smelt it from about a foot away. The taste is very good, first some orange sweetness, then a little malty sweetness, a slight bitterness, then more piney bitterness, and then a clean almost refreshing ending. The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the ending is kind of refreshing, really not expected in DIPA, but that gives it an exceptional rating for drinkabiity."
"Drinkability: After the first long quaff my eyes were spinning in their sockets like a jackpot on a Las Vegas slot machine. A bottomless chasm of full-on DIPA deliciousness in a pint glass - over-the-top-hopped """West coast-style""" pushed to an ultimate conclusion. And from Minnesota 'fer gosh sakes. Hop nirvana for lovers of the DIPA genre. Only caveat: due to the deceivingly smooth drinkability factor the 9% ABV is easily forgotten - only to be remembered several hours later upon waking up on the couch surrounded by empty cans. Cheers!"
"Huge thanks Peter!! Poured form the can into a Portsmouth tulip. Pours a clear amber with a nice off white head. Lively carbonation and nice lacing evident. Good aroma- pine, floral hops and some malt. Taste is the winner! Tons of hops- pine resin, some citrus and a bit of mint. Really smooth for a dipa with this much bitterness. Does that make sense?? Tremendously drinkable. I can literally pour this one down my throat. Medium body, slightly slick mouthfeel. God I love Surly's hop bombs!"
"Here's hoping Surly makes this year round..."
"Lots of body in this one. Some malt in the for front. Not quite what I was expecting, I'll take another taste, sweetness up front and a strong bitterness in the back. Beer is pretty good. There isn't much happening in the front of the palate. Overall its a pretty good but not as good as I hoped."
"Apparently this is the same formula as 16 Grit. Nose is the best feature of the beer. Great pine and floral hops that don't quit. Beautiful. Taste is more pine and some citrus and floral hops, a reasonable malt and caramel presence that balance it a bit. Good drinkability, but having it in close proximity to Barle3y Brown's Chaos and Alpine Duet make it dwarf a bit. Very good, not EPIC."
"D: Seems like Surly can do no wrong. Give me their brown ale, their IPA, their bitter, their RIS, it doesn't matter, they just seem to craft the perfect beer every time. Worth every bit of recognition it gets, Abrasive leaves me saying """Pliney the what?""""
"The beer is medium bodied with an ample level of medium carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. An excellent Imperial IPA with a huge fruit profile that I'm very glad I was able to try. Highly recommended."
"M/D: Just on the fuller side, lower carbonation, pretty slick and smooth mouthfeel. Goes down way too easy for being 9% abv since its so tasty and well balanced. Hard to stop drinking."
"D: I say it everytime I have a Surly beer, and I'll say it again: awesome! These guys really have a good thing going and I'm glad to have some more of this one in the fridge."
"D - Well, the feel definitely adds a lot of size and character to the beer, which is a plus, but it also takes away quaffability(if we consider it as far as DIPAs go). The alcohol is really well hidden, which is another plus. Honestly, the mid-west(or great lakes region) is incredibly impressive when it comes to DIPAs, and Abrasive Ale is no exception."
"Thanks Sean for the retarded package."
"Medium-bodied and neither dry nor syrupy nor overly bitter, I can't fathom why they would choose to call this ale Abrasive. It's a refreshingly unique take on the style, and one of my favorite beers of the year so far."
"D. Not quite up to Furious drinkability standards though at 9% ABV it goes down awfully easy. This is an excellent beer but for $15 a 4-pack, I would reach for Furious over this if I had regular access to these."
"Well - I asked and Surly delivered. Not quite as awesome as the first batch of 16 Grit, but still a highly enjoyable and delicious DIPA. Hope some kegs roll down to Chicago."
"General thoughts: I'm glad that this is harder to come by... that translates to when you do actually find some, it's very fresh and delicious. Enjoy."
"Pretty drinkable. This is a big beer, the alcohol is pretty well hidden, but there is a solid amount of malt, and even more hop presence. If you are jonesing for a new, interesting IIPA this is for you. Another very solid beer from Surly, thanks to chonyr for the can. Hopefully they can manage to distribute some of these to Duluth, id like to buy some."
"Some very solid stuff that does its job as being abrasive to your palate. On-tap it has a notch better cleaned up drinkability and flavor that is missing from the can. Overall it definately says Surly and it definately says Abrasive! Makes my think, what if Flying Dog Double Dog, Sculler's IPA, and Hop Stoopid had offspring in glass."
"Mouthfeel is amazing. Creamy and medium bodied, sticky and not ruinous but intense feeling. Drinkability is great! I've only had a few that were this intense that went down this well. A fantastic beer from Surly. Thrilled to check this off the list. Now if I could only get another 4 pack ;)"
"DELICIOUS and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Super tasty beer with a lot of different dimensions. Would definitely satisfy any IPA lover while adding a new dimension to the taste experience."
"D- This was another very drinkable beer from a company that I am growing to love more and more with each and every beer I try from them. Do yourself a favor and pick this up next time it is at the store. You will be glad you did."
"d - I thought this was a very enjoyable DIPA, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. There was a lot more sweet fruit smell and taste to it than I was expecting, and not nearly as much bitterness as I was expecting with a name like Abrasive. Great feel to it and could not tell it was 9% ABV. Would have again."
"This is damn fine beer. If this was available in Ohio, I'd be a regular customer."
"M/D - Another tasty brew from Surly. Well rounded brew with a lot of hop presence but not overly power full. A brew that you can have more than a couple of in a sitting. A great representation of the DIPA style and it comes highly recommended. Try and get your hands on it since it is almost gone"
"D- A good offering that is well balanced for a DIPA. The alcohol really only presents its self once it warms and you are almost finished with the can. I was excited to try this at DLD but by that time my palate had already been destroyed. When I received a four pack of this I was a little let down. I think I will stick to Furious."
"D: If """Abrasive""" refers to the insane amount of hops in this beer, the name is spot on. This is one of the best DIPA's that I have ever had, and I'm glad that I have seven cans left!"
"I loved this brew, which is what I have come to expect from Surly. Highly recommended for people not necessarily looking for a hop bomb (they are there), but looking for a well-balanced IIPA."
"Overall I think this is a finely crafted beer, but one that does not necessarily live up to the moniker of """imperial"""...your enjoyment of it will entirely depend on what type of IPA you prefer."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty good and fairly drinkable. I'd have another."
"D-I'm certainly glad I gave this one a chance (and had a chance at this one, for that matter, since it flew off the shelves). Quite easy drinking, relative to its style, with a very enjoyable, complex flavor that makes me want to come back for more."
"Overall, I haven't decided if I like this better than the first recipe. Wait...did they even change it? Because it seems pretty similar to me. I'm sure they tweeked the recipe a bit, but this is basically the same great beer that I had last year, except this time around it's in a can."
"D: A very enjoyable brew. Glad I was able to get a fresh four pack fairly quickly after the release."
"Very drinkable. A great DIPA overall. Hopefully Surly brews more of this one."
"Overall, other amazing brew from the people at Surly. I would highly recommend all hop lovers try this beer!"
"Note: I prefer this one to Furious."
"Drinks great- with all the hops here and 9%- the smooth malts keep this very drinkable."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is hard hitting and biting as we would expect from a quality IIPA. This is as drinkable as 9% IIPA's can get, other than the kick in the teeth, I could drink this all day."
"Pours a slightly orangish yellow, similar to a sunset in the bottom of a glass. The aroma is very stronly hoppy. When I taste the beer, the hop flavor isn''t overpowering at all. Much more subtle than I would have thought under the circumstances. Really drinkable. It goes down as easily as a standard pale ale. This is flat out amazing. If I had regular access to this, I would have it stocked in my fridge at all times."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty nice. Overall, I think this is a solid example of the style. I would have liked a little more malt to cut some of the hop bite, but, all in all I really liked this, and am happy I have 3 more cans. Skal."
"D: step aside Hopslam and Double Trouble, I have found a new favorite DIPA. The balance is amazing and the hop profile is assertive yet very palatable. This beer is damn near perfect."
"Poured one into a Duvel glass. Light foamy head disappeared into lace. Appearance is like light maple syrup. Smell is aromatic with pronounced citrus and pine and also a savory umami note. Taste is hoppy pineapple with hints of umami (referred to in other reviews as a garlic note, but I think it's more akin to miso). Flavor profile is complex but quick. Clean finish for this style with minimal hints of caramel. Neutral hops at the very end. Clean and dry. The high ABV (9 - 9.7) WILL catch up with you. My opinion is that this DIPA is even better than Great Divide's Hercules. The reviewer suggests stocking up on this outstanding brew because the production date, as supplied by the brewery website, is April only. Outstanding!"
"D- Great ale very refreshing, a beer you sit down pour into a glass watch the Twins and enjoy, because of the 9% abv a pint is just right, Surly another great reason to live in Minnesota."
"D-very drinkable, but I would drink Furious over this any time, and probably wouldn't drink too many of these bad boys in a row"
"D: Another winner from surly that I would like to add to my regular rotation of brews. I couldnt give this a five because of the abv and i think furious is vastly more drinkable, but this is a stellar brew that I plan to trade for regularly."
"D-I'm glad I tried it. I don't dig all the garlic notes from the hops but that is me. I'd take Furious every day of the year over this. One of my least favorite Surly beers but in no way bad. I had six of these and had them over several nights..they were getting hard to drink at the end...something just doesn't jive right with my buds...will never buy again...unless they change hops eveyr year or something.."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with one finger of white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing. Big hop nose. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical fruit. Not much for malt and the alcohol is not detected. The flavor starts suitably bitter with huge hop flavor. More pineapple and a sticky, resiny pine flavor. Some malt sweetness enters the picture and quickly disappears leaving me wondering if I detected it at all. Anyway, the malt is not overly sweet but enough to carry the hops. Finishes bitter but no sign of alcohol which is quite remarkable. The texture is nothing special but the body is medium and lively carbonated. One of the better brewed DIPAs. Available in cans now so more people will get to enjoy this beer, fresher."
" ~ This is a great Double IPA that I will find a hard time matching. I will definitely seek out more than just the four pack that was delivered to my door by my buddy, Mike Mittendorf. Thanks again Mike!"
"D: A fantastic ale that does justice to the Surly name. The 4 packs are expensive, but I understand that this beer is expensive to make, and it sure shows."
"Overall, Surly has done it again. I had 16 grit last year on tap and this seems to top it. It reminds me a lot of PtY, which I thought was amazing. This beer packs more floral notes however, which is fine by me. It is extremely drinkable and my can is going fast. My wallet is going to be hurting for the next couple of weeks as long as this is on the shelves."
"M/D: Medium Body. Goes down slick and smooth. A bit resinous and chewy. Perfect carbonation. Slightly bitter finish, but much less than Furious. Very drinkable for a DIPA. Goes down smooth and fast, feeling the ABV later."
"I got this beer for 16.99 or so which is a little pricey ... I probably still prefer Furious but this is a nice alternative from the Surly folks."
"Huge thanks to skinnyguy for sending this my way. Amber pour with a nice sized off white head. Aroma is grass, grapefruit, diacetyl, and caramel. Flavor is up front caramel malt, butter, grapefruit rind, toffee, and grass. Bitter finish, good carbonation. Tasted old less than a week after release...not my thing."
"Drinability is good, but there is a bit of an alcohol presence as it warms that detracts."
"Drinkability:Suprisingly drinkable for the ABV and style. Very clean and crisp, more than expected due to extreme freshness. One of the most tasty, easy drinking DIPAS I've had."
"I wish this beer was available year round. It's that good."
"Drinkability is amazing, I do not think there is a double IPA that is more drinkable out there. Another great offering from Surly."
"Thanks Surly for hitting one way out of the park!!!!"
"M&D: A very full-bodied beer. Resinous, chewy, and full of flavor. This beer, despite it's ABV, is extremely drinkable. Price is no factor. A four pack of Abrasive would be very easy to consume in one sitting. West Coast? East Coast? No. This beer has Surly written all over it! It's one of a kind."
"Drinkability: Very unique and flavorful DIPA that just barely misses the mark for me. Still very, very good overall."
"After having another tonight, after a Gubna, I realize even moreso that Abrasive is just not my kind of DIPA. I even notice some of that garlic and onion character, like their Surlyfest has. I'm guessing Summit hops. Maybe I'm wrong. In any case, this is decent enough, just not top of the line like Town Hall, Russian River, Hopslam, or Dreadnaught."
"Must try before you die."
"Well, what to say? Furious is one of my all-time faves & I was hoping Surly would make a IIPA to outshine it (I know, I know, they're only mortal). This is a well-balanced IIPA vs. a hop-bomb, & I normally prefer the latter, but this is excellent. Grab it while it's fresh!"
"+1 to the Furious mixed with Hopslam notion...definitely agree"
"Overall, mix Furious and Hopslam and I think you would get a similar brew. Easy to drink and potentially fatal with the lack of heat and high ABV. Good Stuff."
"So easy to drink, this one could be trouble. Surly nailed this one and I am so ecstatic that it is now in cans. An absolute must try!"
"This beer is a tour de force."
"pours a beautiful peach/almond orange color with a smallish head that recedes to a white ring with lots of sticky lacing on side of glass....the smell is big mango and pineapple and other tropical fruits then some sweet caramel with some grassy and HUGH citrus hop smells nothing overwhelms..it smells fantastic!!..WOW!! the taste is as good as the smell my beer taste buds are hit with tropical fruits..then hops in a taste explosion.. it is then balanced with sweet caramel malts some bready/grassy tastes..the mouth feel is medium which was a surprise but a non issue...nothing in this dipa is fighting for supremacy... it is a masterpiece a benchmark for dipas..i find this to be the most enjoyable and drinkable dipa's i have ever had..the 9% abv is non detectable it is oh so drinkable..superb offering get this while you can it wont stay on the shelf or be offered very long"
"D = Great sipping/relaxing beer. Would be a nice grilling beer for sure. Good stuff, happy to have Surly hear right in our backyard."
"Drinkability- This beer is a bit different than 16 Grit and I have no idea if that is by design. It's not as dry and the malt sweetness is kicked up a bit. That being said it's still an extremely good beer and crazy drinkable for 9%. I was expecting something along the lines of Hopslam (like 16 Grit was) and got something more like Furious (and that's a good thing). Another winner!"
"Nice!"
"D= Excellent brew! Another impressive beer from Surly. Glad they decided to can this one because I missed the growler sales. Beautiful beer with awesome flavor."
"D- Very drinkable and nice I could down this one better and faster then the furious."
"D: Absolutely fantastic!"
"Easy to drink this beer, pleasantly surprised me!"
"Creamy, chewy mouthfeel that goes down smooth and is fairly easy to drink. Overall, I found this to be a good double IPA, however it doesn't rank up there with some of my favorites. I was personally hoping for more and a brighter, cleaner, oilier hop profile."
"D= Pretty drinkable DIPA really, though the flavor profile is not my favorite combination for the style. Absolutely nothing like Surly Furious though."
"This was a pretty thick DIPA, which I love, and that was the highlight of the experience for me. I had this on a warm spring afternoon, where this beer should have really shone. I have to admit I was a little let down. Surly is my jam, but I won't actively seek this one out in the future. Furious does me just right."
"pour is a nice off white tan head with a rather clear amber body. nice lace. nose is a nice breadiness and consistent candied pine apple fruit. with agitation a tangerine/clemente/orange juice breaks through. the palate reveals a milder sweet. the scope is still all the fruits but muted by a nice earthy walnut malt in the sweet. works well with the breadiness. very complex and broad beer. a treat."
"I was hoping for something different from this I guess, but it was still quite a good DIPA. Give it a try if you get the chance."
"D: Very drinkable. The complexity continues to invite sip after sip."
"This was a really terrific beer. It reminded me a lot of Furious on steroids. I was excited to sample this beer along with a """New Haven-style""" pie in the Windy City (go figure!)."
"As far as a DIPA goes, this one is certainly drinkable. Unfortunately, if I want a DIPA, I'd likely reach for something else that would be bigger and bolder. That's what I expect from a DIPA, after all. If I were just in the mood for a 'regular' IPA, this would satisfy that craving, and then some."
"Plenty of random lacing towards the end of consumption."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry for my liking (which I do understand it to style), but not puckering dry bitterness. this is a very drinkable DIPA, but there are others I would choose over it."
"Dreadnaught wins, but I do like both."
"Very unique. Intense, but balanced. Hoppy / gritty, but sophisticated and even elegant at the same time. I like it, but it's hard to wrap my head around it. If you see it - you must try it. That's all I can say."
"Drinkability: Wonderful citrus blend that makes this beer incredibly refreshing"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"Great beer to try and I'm glad I did."
"I'm going to have another one and move onto something else because I can't drink a lot of this. I mean, this is a still a great beer and all, but my tastebuds are already pretty shot."
"D-While I enjoyed this I was left a bit disappointed. I think the hop profile simply didn't work for me in the end as it became to spicy in the end. In fact this was overshadowed during this session by Alpine Pure Hopiness IMHO."
"Bright orange body with slight reddish tint. Sticky cap of foam that clings well to the glass. Pungent and resiny hop aroma. Very citrus forward, and dank like the funky stuff in Snoop's pipe. If I had to guess i'd say Amarillo due to the heavy citrus. Body was a little light, with more balanced maltiness than expected. Tasted like Flossmoor IPAs that use Golden Promise malt. Firm pine bitterness, with some florals mixing in. Dry finish, with a tiny bit of sweetness that helps to savor it. Really nice hop showcase in this balanced DIPA."
"Great double IPA and have no idea how it has stayed fresh for this long, did not taste like it had been in the jug for more than a few hours, whoever traded him this please let me in on your secret, my impression was that these were last filled months ago, wow, anyways would like to have again but not likely unless I make it out to Minnesota, recommended"
"D: This is definitely a drinkable DIPA. Very flavorful, with tons of hoppy aromas and flavors. Not too heavy or alcoholic to turn you off. I could put a few of these back. I hope to see it in a can or bottle some day."
"Very similar to me as hop slam and maharaja, which means I love this beer"
"Feels very smooth and creamy. Rich and dense and very easy to sip. Not a hop monster by any means but pretty damn good."
"Very good but the middle is slightly skewed possibly because of temperature. As the beer warms up it rounds out much more and the malt is much enhanced although still lacking in overall hop appeal really. Sweet malt very bready full of toffee with hints of caramel. Not as hoppy and bitter as I had envisioned and lacking an overall balance with the sweetness of the malt although not cloying. Hops are however sticky and condusive but just lacking a big alpha acid kick. Not sure of the hop variety or if this has been in the growler too long? It is reminiscent of a caramel covered hop."
"I wasn't sure this was still going to have the goods after 2 months plus in a growler, but man was I wrong - taste after taste I was amazed by the terrific smell and taste of citrussy hops, almost lemon like; beautifully balanced, dangerously drinkable, it's been a long time since I've had a beer that amazed me as this one has. I'm very happy to hear they have since made more of this."
"D: Delicious incredibly balanced beer. The hops still really pop out with being so balanced though. This beer lasted much longer in the growler than I had anticipated. Very good."
"D - This almost reminds of an ESB on steroids with american hops. Extremely drinkable and tasty."
"Nice sticky, chewy mouthfeel. Unbelievably drinkable."
"An extremely impressive offering by Surly and it needs to be bottled regulary!!"
"Superb Double IPA! Thanks very much to RustyDiamond for sharing a growler with me and a couple of other Atlanta area BAs. Pours a dark orange/amber with some chill haze with a fairly nice head given the abv and the fact that it was from a shipped growler. Some nice lacing as well. Slightly spicy hops in the nose and with some lovely citrus aromas. The taste is a perfectly balanced blend of firm, slightly sweet malt, pine, and citrus. Wonderfully fresh tasting and scrumptious hops. Just awesome. Incredibly smooth. I don't know what the abv is on this, but I could drink this all day- or until I fell off my stool. Just luscious."
"Poured a medium and cloudy amber color wtih a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of citrus (oranges and grapefruits), pine, floral, tangerines, and 'sticky'. Tastes of the same citrus, pine, caramel, and the same stickiness. Nice and hoppy with a malt balance in the taste. Alcohol content hidden."
"As the story goes this won't be available in Growlers any longer due to Minnesota law changing, sad if it's true and made us toast to one of the last Surly 16 Grit growlers to be consumed."
"D. Nice beer. I wish this one was a regular in their canned lineup. Super drinkable even so sweet and bitter."
"D - got a little depressed after the growler was gone. But I hope that Surley will start canning this beer. It is fantastic!"
"D - much like Furious, this is a big, bold DIPA with tons of hops and a noticeable alcohol presence. While it is very good, I still haven't been blown away by anything from Surly yet. This one fell a little short of my expectations, but it was still quite good overall."
"Pours a dark hazy copper with a frothy off white head. The aroma has a bit of the onion that you get in Furious. The citrus and pine aromas are well blended. The flavor has plenty of malt and hops, and the balance is pretty amazing. Seems full bodied with a sweetish finish."
"D - Can you please please please but this into cans Surly?!"
"D: Different from any other DIPA I've had. Very fresh citrus fruit profile without being extremely bitter. Drinks very easy. This is one great beer."
"D: As balanced an IPA as I can recall having. Malts and hops blend superbly, alcohol seems non-existent. A beer that nears perfection on many levels, and one I deeply regret I'll probably never get to have again."
"This is another fantastic Surly offering. Appearance is very good, a nice orange hazy color with a decent head and lots of oily lacing. Smell was quite good, a nice blast of fresh hops- very complex hop character here. Also a slight bit of spice and grapefruit. My one qualm with the beer is that the taste does not blast me quite as hard as the smell. Mouthfeel is great, oily and moves around well on the palate. Drinkability is fantastic for a DIPA."
"16 Grit's one hell of a fine DIPA. I'm certainly grateful for the opportunity to try it. It's a shame Minnesota law will prevent Surly from selling any more growlers. Honestly, this is a beer that's well worth bottling from here on out. It's very impressive. It could use a little more carbonation, but that's about it. It's fantastic in all other respects. Thanks again, Eric. I really appreciate the opportunity to try this beer. The opportunity's probably not likely to ever emerge again."
"The temperature outside was -16 degrees when I got up this morning. Coincidence? 16 Grit Ale is yet more proof that Surly can stand toe to toe with America's best breweries and not blink. This beer is a remarkable achievement and deserves to released each and every year. A million thanks to the felonious one for coming through again. Your generosity is humbling. Finally... hoppy birthday to me!"
"Poured from a growler gifted from JohnBierman as an extra in a trade (!). I'm finishing my second pint, and I'm seriously loving this beer. John told me it was filled from the bright tank, not kegged first. It could be this is the reason it feels like a cask ale, it has an English """real ale""" body but with massive American hops flavors. The beer is dark copper colored, clear, with a thin white foam. The smell is wickedly good, way better than Furious which smells a lot more like cat piss (I'm not knocking it, it's just the dominant aroma in Furious). I don't really get the feline urine in 16 Grit, mostly the hops come through as grapefruit and pine sap. The taste is stunning, I really don't know how it could be improved. The hops dominate with citrus flavors but there's a malty sweet counterbalance that keeps things interesting taste-wise. The body is stunning too, very """casky""". Probably this is my favorite DIPA at this point, and it's really sad that I'll never see it again after this growler dies."
"Love the artisan nature of the Surly offerings, the Surly attitude, the Surly nation...this company is a true beer geek haven."
"This DIPA does a perfect balancing act betweenteh alcohol, sweet malt and wonderfully aromatic hops, with a lingering and delicious bitterness that never exhausts the palate. I love it, and I am not usually a DIPA lover; hop monster lovers moight find this beer tame, but they will probably admit that this is a wonderful beer."
"Overall this is one of the better DIPA's I've had, and thanks again to gford217 for sharing this."
"Poured from a 64oz Surly growler with a two finger head that faded very slowly and had a crystal clear copper appearance. A huge citrus hop aroma and slight maltiness reappeared in the taste which hit the tongue like a hop semi - explosive! Felt smooth going down and the hops caught the tongue like little hop needles. Amazingly easy to drink for the amount of hops and high alcohol content. Very impressed with this beer and feel very lucky to have had it. I hope Surly seriously considers brewing it again next year because I've never had a DIPA quite like this - essentially furious on steroids!"
"I can't thank Brian and Bill enough for the opportunity to try and share this great beer with everyone this weekend. It is quite possibly the most drinkable DIPA I have tasted and one of the better beers I have tried in a while. Excellent."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. really nice depth overall. it didn't kick me in the face quite like i expected, coming across with more finesse than i would have guessed from the name and the brewery. good stuff. time for another glass!"
"Pours a slightly hazed dark copper/orange, medium thick off white head forms, drops to a thin layer and medium ring, nice lacing spirals, good retention, retains a real solid layer. Smell is nice, lots of caramel maltiness, some apple/orange, tangerines, grapefruit, floral, bready middle, lightly resinous hops, pineapple, tropical fruit, nicely balanced with the malts, more orange peel in the finish. Taste is nice too, lots of sweet orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple and floral, bready middle, some sweet honey and caramel malts, more orange peel and tangerine, quite a unique flavour, nice bitterness in the finish, well balanced, and the alcohol is nicely hidden. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, interesting stuff, very smooth and drinkable. Thanks Russ!"
"Overall I am very happy that Surly made this, and that I got to try it! One of the bestDIPA I have had, definitely one of the most drinkable. This is one to eek out for sure."
"Classified here as a double IPA. I'd have no problem calling it an american barleywine. Heck, I'd have no problem if they bottled this and I grabbed a stash for me! Well worth trying if you get a chance."
"Alcohol is well hidden, and at least feels under 10%. Another very good Surly offering."
"Thanks to JCB for this wonderful growler surprise. Bm'd me out of the blue and asked if i wanna meet up. Cloudy orange pour. Fluffy off white head and drippy lace. Fresh hop aroma (amarillos). Perfect bittersweet balance. Lots of tropical fruit flavors."
"If I were to review Abrasive it would be scored 4/5/5/5/5"
"It is a shame that it was a special run to celebrate the end of Saturday growler sales due to state law issues. It is so powerful in flavor and taste that you just can not drink it all the time but it would be great to have a couple of cans for those nights when a change is in order."
"I got one of the last growlers on Monday morning, another great beer from Surly. Not as bitter as I thought it might be, pretty balanced for a DIPA. Hopefully this shows up again in the future!"
"Right off the bat this beer reminds me of Orange rum and then once I ponder the flavors, I realize it's similar to Surly's delicious Bitter Brewer. Orange citrus hops are the big flavor and aroma note for me in what is a surprisingly appropriately balanced DIPA. There are more pine and grapefruit in the background with subtle cinnamon spices and a very slight vanilla note. Jesus, this is good. I know I'm not the first or last person to say this, but I wish there was more of this beer. Easily one of my favorite DIPAs, better than Pliny the Elder even. If you can ever find this baby, drink it before someone else does."
"D: Might be the heaviest IPA you could pass on to your girlfriend."
"Overall I would say this is the best DIPA I have ever had. It has the huge hops but is still very drinkable."
"Named 16 Grit, in honor of his dad's abrasives business, where the brew house is situated. Growler picked up and drank the very same day, fresh as can be. Into a pint glass, pours a dark amber copper color with a nice off-white head, good retention. The aroma is intense, some fantastic fruits popping out, caramel malts hovering in there too. The taste is even better, lives up to its name but drinkability doesn't suffer. The same fruits and caramel sugar are there, sweeter than I'd have thought. The mouth is great, thick, coating, oozing, but not syrupy, not too hot, lovely. Overall, probably the quickest I've ever drank a growler, if that says anything."
"Herbal hop bitterness rings out up front. Pine resin/sap flavors follow, mixing with cookie dough malt. Hints of boozy fruits as well. Pineapple, tangerine, and mango hop bitterness come on strong near the finish. Faint warming notes, before cat pee, aspirin, and grapefruit bitterness take over the finish. Lingering fruit sweetness. Very nice! Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and very drinkable--especially if you like very fresh hop blast!"
"Overall: Amazing. This might be the best DIPA out there. Too bad it's such a limited time. I love Surly and once again they've made a world class brew."
"Another home run from Surly. They deserve all the accolades they get. It's sad that this will only be brewed once. I'm glad I had the opportunity to grab it while it was around."
"Hint, hint. Todd..."
